W. 1. ,30TH AUGUST, 1951.
ANNEXECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF A german military CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN DEFENCE4. Thus, in 1950-51 Germany spent between 5 and 6 per cent, of her national income on purposes related to Western defence, and is being called on to paybetween 7 to 9 per cent, in 1951-52, although full budgetary provision has notyet been made for expenditure at this rate. The Federal Government has also been&quot;furnishing aid to Berlin, which is in the nature of a defence contribution, at therate of DM. 600 million a year. In addition, some DM. 4-2 milliard is spent onrefugees and on the prevention of social unrest, which the Germans consider although we do not should also be regarded as part of their contribution to defence.5. Of the total of Occupation costs for 1951-52, the United Kingdom shareis DM. 2 08 milliard, or approximately  175 million. Of this share, however, only 140 million is expended on the maintenance of the British Forces and the control commission a figure which may rise to as much as  180 million by 1952-53 owingto rises in prices and reinforcements. This, broadly speaking, is the measure ofthe financial interest at stake for the United Kingdom in any new arrangementsaffecting Germany&apos;s contribution to defence.41139 bReport by the Mutual Aid Committee **1. His Majesty&quot;s Government have agreed in principle to the creation of aGerman military force for Western defence because if Europe is to be safe from enemy occupation it must be defended in Germany, and, because the Allied forces available are inadequate for this purpose, with German military assistance. Theyhave, however, always reserved their right to consider the timing and nature ofthis contribution (CM. (50) 59th Conclusions, Minute 1, and CM. (51) 56th Con-clusions, Minute 6). The question of a German military force has now becomeinextricably associated with the development of our political relationship withGermany in Western Europe. A decision on a German force cannot with safetybe deferred much longer without serious political repercussions in Germany itself.Final decisions on these matters may, therefore, have to be made within the nextfew months and the purpose of this paper is to draw attention to certain aspectsother than those primarily of military and political concern of which account mustbe taken.2 It has become evident that the raising of a German military force will have considerable economic repercussions both on the German economy and on the economies of the Occupying Powers. This report has accordingly been preparedby the Mutual Aid Committee on the basis of information at present available inorder to set out the economic and financial implications, particularly for the UnitedKingdom, of raising such a contribution to European or N.A.T.O. forces and toindicate the issues on which policy decisions will eventually have to be taken.The scale and nature of the contribution now being made by Germany to WesternDefence3. Western Germany is already required to provide considerable sums forthe maintenance of Allied forces in Germany. These are charged to the Germanbudget on a mandatory basis as Occupation costs even though Ihe function of theAllied Forces has changed from that of an occupying army to that of providing the outer shield for the Western countries against Russian aggression. These costsmay be summarised as follows:  DM. milliard1951-521950-51      (Proposed Scale)Occupation costs        ......      ...   .4-3 7-9Mobile police   ............      Nil -2Total............      4-3 81v
6. The capacity of the German people to pay Occupation costs at the proposedscale is being increasingly debated in Germany. The German Government and,through it, German public opinion is growing more hostile, especially because ofthe mandatory nature of the impost. To meet the bill the Allies have presented,increased taxation and economies elsewhere are essential, but the rigidly Federalcharacter of the German constitution, general tax morality and growing resistance to Occupation costs make this peculiarly difficult. An approach from the federal chancellor for financial help in some form is to be expected. Thiis, even withoutthe complication of the German defence contribution it is not to be expected thatwe could much longer continue to obtain Occupation costs on the full scale proposed for 1951-52.Consequences of a German military contribution7. If Germany has now to make a direct military contribution for which she must be in some measure financially responsible it will affect the situation as itexists at present in three ways:  -(i) A German military contribution will have to be paralleled in the politicalfield by the placing of most of the powers at present reserved to theAllies on a contractual basis. It must be assumed that in this processwe shall no longer be able to retain our present right to levy charges for the cost of Allied forces in Germany upon the German budgetwithout prior German consent. Since we shall be dealing with a problem of German partnership in Western defence rather than theoccupation of Germany by Allied forces, there would indeed be littlejustification for the maintenance of the present arrangement. Themandatory system, as we know it at present, will, therefore, come toan end.(ii) It may be anticipated, though it cannot be proved, that it will be easier forthe Germans to raise money to support a German military contributionrather than in aid of compulsory Occupation costs. For this reason, andalso because of economic progress, it may be assumed that Germany^capacity to pay will increase.(iii) On the other hand, the cost of the direct German military contribution will clearly fall heavily, particularly during the period of re-equipment, on theGerman budget; the Germans will claim that it should have a priorityhigher than that of contributions to the Allied forces, and whatever wemay do it may in practice be difficult to ensure that the latter does nothave second place.German capacity to pay8. The three elements of the Allied High Commission have stated that thebest estimate which they can make of German ability to contribute to western defence in the present circumstances, i.e., in Occupation costs, is DM. 9 milliard.It should, however, be noted that the contribution in its present form does notoccasion any industrial dislocation nor any balance of payments problem com-parable to that caused by defence expenditure elsewhere. We consider that, if germany is making a direct military contribution, the provision of at least DM. 10milliard, rising later to DM. 12 milliard or even more, should not place an impossibleburden upon her economy, nor, with proper safeguards, need it lead to inflationwith its undesirable financial and political consequences. At the same time, a contribution on this scale would, in terms of percentage of National Income, beara reasonable relationship to the contribution of, say, the United Kingdom andFrance.The cost to the German Budget of a Military Contribution9. Until agreement has been reached on the size, nature and timing of aGerman military contribution, estimates of its cost to the German economy are of necessity highly speculative. With every possible reserve as to the resultantcalculation we have made certain assumptions under the following heads, based onthe discussions between the representatives of the Federal Government and of theAllied High Commission at Bonn, and such preliminary examination of the Germanproposals as has already taken place.
(a) SizeWe assume that whether a contribution be made direct to the N.A.T.O. forces under General Eisenhower or through the medium of a European Army, the ground forces will not be allowed to exceed at any time 20 per cent, of the forces at GeneralEisenhowers immediate disposal, or ultimately approximately twelve divisions,with appropriate tactical air support. We also assume some light naval forces and coastal defence for the Baltic.Having regard to the international negotiations which must first be completed,the national planning and passage of legislation required in Germany, and the setting up of training establishments, we have assumed that actual recruitment ofthe rank and file could not commence before October 1952 and full strength couldnot be achieved until 1955.10. Starting from these assumptions we have examined the Germans&apos; ownestimates of costs of a military contribution as put forward in the Bonn discussions.These envisaged a total capital, or &quot; non-recurrent,&quot; expenditure on arms, equip-ment, works and buildings, &amp;c, of approximately DM. 20 milliard, and an annual expenditure of DM. 2-2 milliard. We have then sought to estimate the probablecost in each of the three years after 1952 likely to fall on the German economy.We have in our estimates taken considerable liberties with the German figures to accord with our own assessment of probability, of which the most importantmodifications are:  (i) We have made adjustments to allow for an ultimate force of 350,000 as opposed to the German figure of 250,000, in order more realistically to reflect the man-power requirements of 12 Army divisions.(ii) We have assumed a smaller air force.(iii) We have assumed that all heavy arms will be provided free by the UnitedStates and made heavy reductions on the German figures to allow forthe fact that they appear to be in part based on United States prices and possibly on over elaborate scales of provisioning. This reduces the total German capital expenditure by about two-thirds.(iv) We anticipate that the expenditure on works and buildii lgs will be spreadover four years.11. As a result we estimate that a possible rate of expenditure by germany on German armed forces might be:  These figures are subject to many reservations, but may serve as illustrative of thepossible order of magnitude of the costs involved. Expenditure in subsequent years might be at less than the rate for 1954-55 as the initial equipping and con-struction would have been completed, but we doubt the utility of attempting any estimate so far ahead.12. The background against which the estimates in paragraph 11 were framed is,however, extremely uncertain. The Germans will, of course, be anxious to increasethe strength of their Armed Forces as quickly as possible; they estimated at Bonn,for example, that the whole of the non-recurrent expenditure of DM. 20 milliardwould be incurred during the first year of their build-up. American pressure will certainly be applied in the same direction and it may be that our ideas of the relatively low priority on which the Germans should be supplied with heavy equipment from America (with its retarding effect on the rate of build-up of theirArmed Forces) will not be accepted by them. To the extent that the americans are unable or unwilling to supply arms from their own production at the rate whichthey regard as necessary for the build-up, they might press for the manufacture in Germany of heavy military equipment on the N.A.T.O. prohibited list, and substantial German expenditure might thus arise towards the end of the three-year period covered by the estimates in paragraph 11.   It may be too that the Germans(b) TimingorDM. 1 - 2 milliard1952-53 100 million1953-54 340 millionorDM. 4-08 milliard1954-55 500 millionorDM. 5-9 milliard41139b 2
will be able to complete their works programme more quickly than we have assumed and that its cost over which we shall have no control will be substantially higher. For all these reasons the rates of German expenditure on their forcesgiven in paragraph 11 may prove to have been considerably under-estimated.13. If support for the Allied Forces and expenditure on Berlin were to continue at their present scale, and if the cost of the German military effort were added inaccordance with our estimate in paragraph 11 the cost to the German budgetwould-be:  -On the basis of these very tentative figures, it could be argued that, allowing forsome increase in German national income over the next five years, the germans could shoulder the whole of this burden But as has been explained, our estimatesmay be too conservative, and there will in any event be extreme difficulties ininducing them to make a fair defence effort particularly when the cost of supporting the Allied Forces represents so large a proportion of the whole. We must expect to be under constant and increasing pressure for reductions, and it will require a firm and united stand by the United States, and United Kingdom and France notonly to obtain acceptance of the principle of a German payment for the maintenanceof Allied forces in addition to a military contribution, but also to collect it yearby year. We have therefore found it necessary to consider the consequences of theloss in whole or in part of what is now covered by Occupation costs.Economic implications for the United Kingdom14. Any reduction in the amount of our share of Occupation costs paid byGermany will impose an additional burden on the United Kingdom Budget and onour external balance of payments. To the extent that seme part of the costs ofmaintaining United Kingdom troops in Germany ceases to be a charge on theFederal Budget, it must be assumed by the United Kingdom Budget. Furthermore,to the extent that Deutschmarks are no longer available to us free to make paymentsnecessary in support of our forces in Germany, we shall have to pay sterling acrossthe Exchanges. If Occupation costs were to be eliminated and present practicewere to continue unchanged, the additional charge to the Budget, and the additionalforeign exchange burden, would be approximately  150 million in 1951-52 rising to  180 million in 1952-53. This allows for the increase in United Kingdom forcesin Germany now planned, but assumes the payment by Norway, Denmark andBelgium of the cost of maintenance of their contingents now met from our shareof Occupation costs. We have therefore made some preliminary analysis of the items which make up this total, in order to indicate where possibilities of economymay lie, and what opportunities exist of substituting sterling for Deutschmarkexpenditure.The present Deutschmark Costs of British Forces in Germany15. About one-third of Occupation costs are spent on German labour, thebalance being divided between capital works, transportation, living accommodation and public utilities. Compared with practice elsewhere, the standard of goods and services is high both in amount and cost, because of the mandatory system datingfrom the earliest days of the Occupation which hitherto has rendered normal finan-cial control on our part unnecessary. But the principal factor is our use of Germanlabour wherever we can. This is in accordance with the general policy appliedwherever possible of employing civilians abroad to free Service man-power fortraining; conditions in Germany have hitherto been particularly favourable tothis policy, and have permitted the use of Germans in administrative duties incombatant units, depots, workshops, &amp;c, as an essential and integral part of thefighting services. Thus a total of 75,000 British personnel employed some 175,000Germans at 31st March, 1951, of whom 141,000 were in support of the Britishfighting services.Milliard DM.In 1951-52,, 1952-53,, 1953-54,, 1954-558-79-9012-7814-6
5 216.   There are three possible ways of finding economies (a) The imposition of such economies as would be necessary to make standardscomparable with those of other Commands (with reasonable regardto any special conditions in Germany). A number of economies havealready been effected. Others are being vigorously pursued and mightyield an eventual saving of 10 per cent.(b) Possible financing of certain costs on an international basis.  Any benefitto the United Kingdom would, under present international arrange-ments, be confined to the major part of airfield expenditure of  3 - 3 mil-lion in 1951-52 and over  9 million in 1952-53.(c) A major change of policy in the employment of German labour.   Anyproposal to withdraw the German labour force employed in supportof the British fighting services would entail a decision of policy of thefirst magnitude. To the extent that they were not replaced it wouldinvolve a reduction in the effective strength of the British forces inGermany. Their replacement would involve complete reorganisation of the British forces, changes in the distribution of existing man-power resources as between the three Services, and a reduction in the numberof fighting units elsewhere, with a consequent material reduction intheir fighting efficiency.Even if the replacement could be effected without increasing the charge onthe United Kingdom Budget, the charge on the balance of payments would notbe reduced pro tanto, owing to the extra commitments which the accommodation,maintenance, &amp;c, of extra military personnel in Germany would entail.17. If both administrative economies were carried out and no German labourwhatever were employed, with the evident disadvantages attaching to that course,the maximum theoretical saving in deutschmarks would be considerably less than40 per cent.Consequences for the United Kingdom Budget18. While it may in these ways be possible to reduce the costs to the UnitedKingdom Budget to some extent, the risk remains of a substantial additional charge on the United Kingdom taxpayer which will have to be met either by a reductionin the United Kingdom defence expenditure elsewhere or by an increase in total united Kingdom defence expenditure. This clearly raises a major policy issue.On the one hand Ministers have affirmed (E.P.C. (51) 14th Meeting of 3rd July)that no further load is to be placed on the economy for defence purposes in addi-tion to that necessary for the conclusion of the programme agreed upon in January;this means that (subject to consideration of the effects of any price increases) 4,700 million is the absolute limit of expenditure on defence which the country can stand over the next three years and the developments of the last nine months have made evident the gravity of the burden which this imposes on us. There isno need to emphasise the serious effect of reversing this decision and adding a burden of anything up to  400 million in real resources to the present defence programme. On the other hand, the object of a German contribution to defence is to increase the total forces available to Western defence, rather than to substitute a German effort for some part of our own. If, therefore, the result of any reduc-tion made in our own effort were to reduce or delay our full provision for theN.A.T.O. command, the object would be in some degree defeated.Consequences to the United Kingdom Balance of Payments19. The effects on the United Kingdom balance of payments will, of course,depend primarily upon the amount of additional overseas expenditure falling onthe Exchequer. If we were to cease to receive Occupation costs altogether, and noeconomies were effected, the additional overseas expenditure which we had to incurwould be at the annual rate of  150 million in the current vear. risina to about 180 million in 1952-53.20. This would be a new and dangerously large burden on our balance ofpayments. The possible scale of the impact on our external economy would beabout the same as the loss of Persian oil; the extent of the measures which wouldbe required to offset it may be illustrated by the fact that the amount involved is equivalent to about 25 per cent, of our imports from Europe, or to about 15 per
cent, of our world-wide exports of consumer goods. In particular, the completecessation of Occupation costs would threaten us with a large and continuing deficitwith the European Payments Union, to which we should inevitably have to paysubstantial amounts of gold; this situation would incidentally have a seriouslyweakening effect on our influence in Europe, which, experience has shown, can be effective in economic matters only when our financial position is strong.2.1. Conversely, there would be a great strengthening of Germany&apos;s external financial position, which would no doubt have an important bearing on Germany&apos;sstrength and influence in Europe. This strengthening of her position would make it possible for Germany to begin to repay at any rate her post-war external indebted-ness, and, if the full amount owing under this head to the United Kingdom couldbe repaid in three years, we should obtain relief to our baiance of payments (andto the Budget) at the rate of approximately  60 million per annum. If the same principle could be applied to the matured portion of Germany&apos;s pre-war sterlingdebts, both Reich and private, further payments of  35 million a year would bringrelief to the balance of payments to that extent (but not, of course, to the Budget).None of this could, however, be achieved save by agreement with the americans and the French and negotiations with the Germans.22. This balance of payments problem which is brought to light by thediscussion of the future of Occupation costs is implicit in the arrangements which require substantial British forces to be maintained on the Continent. The fact thatthe Germans have been paying these very large local expenditures of our forces,as Occupation costs; has concealed the serious potential burden on our balance ofpayments which the location of our forces implies. This is precisely the sameproblem, in the context of the peace-time defence of Western Europe, as led to thegreat accumulation of indebtedness in World War II for the defence of India,Egypt and the rest of the Middle East.Elements of a solution23. It is therefore evident that, on both budgetary and balance of paymentsgrounds, we must seek to avoid the economic effects on ourselves of a Germandefence contribution by endeavouring to obtain in one way or another a financial contribution to defence from Germany sufficiently large to cover both the military contribution and our essential deutschmark expenditure in Germany. We believethat it is economically possible for Germany to make such a contribution. but whether in practice these objectives can be achieved will turn on the willingnessrather than the economic ability of the Germans to carry their financial share Ofthe defence burden, and the firmness and solidarity of the United States, theFrench and ourselves in pressing for a solution on these lines.How Germany&apos;s Fair Contribution to Defence might be obtained24.   The key to this problem is therefore clearly political.   To what extentcan we rely on German willingness to make a contribution of the necessary order,how far will the Americans and the French support us, and what means of pressureare available?   There can be no doubt that the German Government is in factanxious to make a military contribution, as it is extremely conscious of the veryconsiderable political advantages which will accrue as a result.   But to date they Ihave with some skill contrived to be courted rather than themselves courting this development, and will undoubtedly argue that they should be wholly released fromthe maintenance costs of Allied troops. It is on the means of pressure that we must i therefore rely, and to be effective this must be exerted in concert by the occupying IPowers.  There is some hope that both our partners will be of similar mind to fourselves.   The American military authorities at least will be most anxious notto swell their bill to Congress by the cost of maintenance of United States troopsin Germany, and in their draft of the contractual arrangements have stated that theFederal Budget should bear the cost of the defence contribution and the supportof Allied Forces in Germany, in that order of priority.  The French apparently i hope that Occupation costs will continue to be paid under existing arrangements and not placed on a contractual basis.25. Initially therefore the interests of the three Powers would seem identical,but motives differ. The prime American concern is for a German military contribu-tion to be made as soon as possible, the French for completion of political agreement on a European Army, for which no real financial plans have been laid,while we, though fully alive to defence considerations, must necessarily have the
economic effects particularly in mind. Nor are the means of pressure equallyshared. In the iasl analysis our only weapon would be to threaten drastic reduc-tion of our troops, which as the Germans would be well aware, would involvesuch impossible political and strategic consequences that the threat itself would be ineffective. The French would no doubt reconcile themselves to Occupation costsif they were able to obtain some form of United States aid for themselves to compensate for any increased financial burden on France. Only the americans have an argument to which the Germans will always be sensitive the threat of withdrawl of aid. Unless the United States is prepared in the last resort to use this threat to obtain German agreement to an adequate total contribution we can have little hope of a solution tolerable to ourselves.Commercial implications for the United Kingdom26. There is a further point which must be borne in mind, although it is of along-term nature. Having regard to existing limitations on the German rearmament -ment industry, their engineering industry will be relatively free of the heavy burden which rearmament imposes on our own, and their competitive position overseas willconsequently be strengthened, which may in turn improve their external position possibly at our expense. From this point of view and disregarding security con-siderations there would be advantage if some of the limitations approved byN.A.T.O. on the German heavy armament industry were raised and they were themselves required to manufacture a large part of the heavy equipment whichthey will require. This, however, would reduce their need for United States enditem aid and increase the burden on their own budget, consequently still furtherreducing the amount which we could hope to obtain by way of support for theAllied Forces. We are here in a dilemma. The greater the United States suppliesof arms and aircraft to Germany, the more risk that our own military supplies fromthe United States needed to complete the equipment of our own forces may be curtailed. But if the Germans manufacture their own arms, not only is their ability to contribute to Allied deutschmark costs reduced, but they cease to be sodependent on the Allied Powers for the means of defence, and may therefore feel able to assert an undesirable independent line. On balance, we conclude that our immediate economic interests, on budgetary and balance of payments grounds,combine with the political factors to require acceptance of the added risks to our overseas markets and the supply of equipment from the United States, implicit inlimiting German arms production.Conclusions27. (i) A German military contribution to N.A.T.O. or to a European armyraises in acute form the future financing of the cost of maintaining Allied forcesin Germany.(ii) The amount of financial support for our troops in Germany which weshall be able in future to extract from the Germans will depend in the last resorton the willingness of the Germans to provide it and on the timing and cost of theirown military force.(iii) On the assumptions which we have made regarding cost and timing, itshould be possible on economic grounds for Germany to meet essential Allieddeutschmark expenditure while financing the cost to Germany of the german military force, and in doing so she would probably not be paying more than herfair share for Western Defence.(iv) These assumptions may, however, prove over-optimistic and it will be particularly difficult to induce the Germans to make a fair defence effort when thecost of the support of Allied forces represents a high proportion of the whole.(v) Any reduction in the amount of our share of Occupation costs paid byGermany threatens an additional burden on the United Kingdom Budget and our external balance of payments. If we had as a result to shoulder the whole presentdeutschmark cost of our forces in Germany, the increased budgetary cost wouldbe of the order of  150 to  180 million a year, with a burden on our balance ofpayments of a similar order.(vi) It must be our objective to ensure if possible that our essential deutsch-mark expenditure in Germany is covered by the German contribution, but thisis likely to prove very difficult in any event, and particularly if the rate of bui.&apos;d-upof a German military force is quicker, its cost higher or American aid less thanassumed.
(vii) Economies in the United Kingdom expenditure in Germany or somecompensating payments of other kinds, e.g., debt settlements would, to the extent they can be realised, mitigate the effect on the United Kingdom Budget and balanceof payments.(viii) Substantial economies could only be made in Germany by a major changeof policy in the employment of German labour, which, would involve completereorganisation of the British forces, changes in the distribution of existing man-power and forces as between the three services, and a reduction in the number of fighting units either in Germany or elsewhere. Even these economies could onlycover a small part of our deutschmark expenditure.(ix) Significant relief could be obtained if it proved possible to negotiateagreement both with our Allies and the Germans for full repayment within a fewyears of Germany^ post-war external indebtedness and her matured pre-warsterling debts.(x) If it should not be possible to secure that our essential deutschmarkexpenditure is met. the additional burden on our defence programme will necessi-tate important decisions as regards either the scale of our defence programme orthe nature of the economies necessary to keep it within the existing ceiling and atthe same time avoid serious prejudice to our balance of payments.Recommendations28. (i) We should seek an early opportunity, in the context of our own economic problems, of impressing upon the United States Administration, the con-sequences which are liable to result for the Allies from the creation of a german military force. At these discussions in which the French should participate, weshould maintain that we cannot accept any additional charge either to our Budgetor on our balance of payments. We must accordingly explore with the UnitedStates and French Governments means (as indicated in paragraphs (ii) (v) below)of avoiding this additional charge without prejudice to the common defence effort.(ii) We should urge that, without prejudice to our own defence programme andthat of other N.A.T.O. Powers, the largest possible quantity of heavy armaments andnotably military and naval aircraft, which the Germans cannot in any event hope to manufacture for themselves in the early stages, should be provided free by theUnited States as end-item aid.(iii) We should seek an understanding from the Americans to make further help to Germany dependent if necessary on satisfactory arrangements for the pro-vision by the Federal German Government of support for Allied forces in germany which we believe to be fully within their economic capacity.(iv) We should endeavour to secure tripartite agreement on making the most critical scrutiny of the German figures for equipment and capital expenditure on defence.(v) We should establish with the Americans that there is a close relationship between any beneficial effects on the German balance of payments of a german military contribution and Germany&apos;s capacity to pay foreign debts; but should notpursue any specific proposals in the debt context until the prospect of obtaining &quot;from the Germans a fair contribution to the cost of Allied forces in Germany hasbeen assessed.(vi) At the same time, we should instruct the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner (a) to prepare plans, in conjunction with his United States and French col-leagues for all possible reductions of Allied use of capital installations in Germany in order to lower initial German outlay on capital equipment;(b) to continue to impress upon the Federal Government the need for increased taxation to meet a situation in which a heavier burden than the existing level of Occupation&apos; costs will be placed upon the Federal Exchequer;(c) to explore in the High Commission and at an appropriate time with theFederal Government the possibility of meeting some part of the non-recurrent expenditure by an internal loan.(vii) Efforts to reduce our own DM. costs in Germany should be intensified,in the knowledge that, unless means other than transfers of sterling can be found of meeting our DM. needs, drastic economies may become necessary.Cabinet Office, London, SWA,24th August, 1951.
