&quot;    173 vDOCUMENT IS THE &quot;PROPERTY CF HIS BRITANNIC MAJE T-Y&apos;S government secret.x0.(5l) 260 COPY NO. *il1ST OCTOBER, 1951CABINETfuture of the south BANK siteivlemorandum by the Lord Privy seal i recently circulated to the Prime minister and to those of mycolleagues principally concerned a report by a working party of officials on the winding up of the South Bank Exhibition, and the use of the site untilwork begins on the long-term developments which have already been plannedby the London County Council with the agreement of the Ministry of LocalGovernment and Planning.2. The report by officials has been generally agreed, subject to onemajor issue which I discuss in the following paragraphs and to certain minorchanges which in general I am willing to accept, and this being so I amavailing myself of the authority which the Prime vlinister has given for itsagreed recommendations to be implemented.3, There is, however, one point of policy on which I must seek adecision by my colleagues.   The working party recommended that the major part of the section of the site upstream of Charing Cross railway bridgewhich has been earmarked in the long-term plan for new government buildings should be handed over to the Ministry of Works as soon as exhibitshave been removed from the Festival buildings - which should be by the endof December at latest - in order that they can proceed at once with certainurgent defence work which will eventually form part of the permanentGovernment building.4. I disagree with this recommendation on three grounds:-First, I think now that it would be a mistake to proceed with the ideaof a Government building on the South Bank site;Secondly, even if the policy of erecting a large Government office onthe South Bank is re-affirmed I think it is rash, in the light of the NewColonial Office episode, to start excavation work until full plans for thescheme have been published and are known to be acceptable to publicopinion, and thirdly, I fear that in practice there will be a long interval afterthe excavations and before the superstructure of the building can proceedduring which the site will be closed to the public and will remain an eyesore.5. The Minister of Works is unable to accept my views on this andI must therefore invite the Cabinet to adjudicate between us.
6. I hope that the Cabinet will invite the Minister of Works tore-examine with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofLocal Government and Planning and myself, and with the LondonCounty Council, the possibility of finding some other site for this government office and releasing this part of the South Bank for culturaluses.7. If, however, the Cabinet decide that the previous decisions(the latest of which is L.P.(48) 15th Meeting, Minute 2) should stand,I would still urge that the Minister of Works, before he begins operations on the site, should first prepare and make available for public criticisma complete architectural plan, and should produce evidence that the plancan be completed without serious risk of interruption.R, R. 3.Office of the Lord Privy Seal,1ST OCTOBER, 1951.
