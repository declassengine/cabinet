CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 3 1CP. (51) 23126th July, 1951CABINETFUTURE OF THE BRITISH council memorandum by the Secretaries of State for Foreign Affairs, Colonies and commonwealth relations at their meeting on 21st February, 1946, (CM. (46) 17th Conclusions,Minute 4 (2)) the Cabinet agreed that the British Council should be continued fora period of five years.   This period came to an end on 31st March last.2.   The main conclusions which can be drawn from experience of the Councilsactivities during the past five years are as follows:  (i) that the Council, in its work of familiarising foreign, colonial and Com-commonwealth peoples with the ideals, methods and achievements of thiscountry, lends an important aid to the maintenance of British politicaland trading influence in the widest sense, and plays an increasingly important part in developing satisfactory relations between this countryand the peoples of the colonies and of the new self-governing territories of the Commonwealth; that it is valuable as presenting a positivealternative to communism; and that these services are such that, if theCouncil did not exist, some other agency supported by public funds would be needed in its place;(ii) that there are solid advantages in this work being done by a non-officialbody and not by a governmental organisation.recommendations.   We have therefore four recommendations to make:  (1) That the British CounciFs existence should be prolonged indefinitely, butthat some form of review should take place at the end of ten years inorder to ascertain whether any modifications of the existing organisationand administration are necessary.(2) That the non-official status of the Council should be preserved.(3) That since, in order to plan work of a long-term nature, to lease premises and to secure a fair proportion of staff on a long-term basis, some formof stabilisation of its authorised expenditure is essential, the overseas departments should be instructed to work out, in consultation with theTreasury, a reasonable minimum figure below which, subject to excep-tional circumstances, the income of the Council should not over anumber of years be permitted to fall.(4) That in the course of the examination referred to in (3) attention shouldbe given to the possibility of making further reductions in the size ofthe Councils headquarters.Circumstances of the Cabinet decision of 1946 and the principal questions now tobe decided4.  The British Council is a grant-aided body incorporated by a Royal Charter .which sets no limit to the period of its existence, but no special financial provision has ever been made for its work to continue indefinitely.   On 22nd June, .1944, theWar Cabinet Committee on the Machinery of Government recommended that a40963 biS   document  is  the   property   of  his  britannic  majesties   government//v printed for the Cabinet.   July 1951
full enquiry should be carried out under the auspices of the Foreign Secretary andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer. This enquiry was undertaken by Sir FindlaterStewart, who reported on 8th February, 1945, in favour of its continuance as anindependent organisation, but with certain changes in the form of its governing body. The Foreign Office did not agree with a number of his recommendations.The whole matter was included in the purview of an Official Committee on government Information Services, whose report was presented to the Cabinet bythe Lord President of the Council on 12th&quot; February, 1946 (CP. (46) 54). TheCabinet, at their meeting mentioned in paragraph 1, gave authority for the Councilto continue for a further five years &quot; on the understanding that there should bea closer scrutiny of its projected activities, that it should no longer have authorityto do its own production and procurement work, and that its scope should be restricted to educational and cultural work and should not overlap with theGovernments Information Services.&quot;5. There has been no difficulty in putting into effect the second and thirdprovisions of this decision, and as regards the first a close scrutiny of the Councilsactivities has been maintained by the Overseas Departments at home and theirrepresentatives abroad, and the Select Committee on Estimates (1947-48 Session,Third Report) has investigated them in great detail. Particulars of the financial sideof the method of control are given in paragraph 3 of the Appendix to this paper.Generally speaking, this scrutiny has achieved its end. The matter, therefore, whichwe now put before our colleagues is that of the future of the CounciFs existence,and this appears to depend on the answers to two questions: (1) whether the work done by the British Council is an indispensable adjunct to the policy of HisMajesty&apos;s Government towards foreign, colonial and Commonwealth countries, andif so (2) whether that work is better done by a non-official body than by a Govern-ment Department.6. The Cabinet in 1946 gave a qualified affirmative answer to both these ques-tions. Experience of the British Councils operations on the scale to which theyhad grown was mainly that of war-time, and it was necessary to observe their effect in the post-war situation. An assessment of the Council&apos;s work in its three overseasspheres since 1946, and some idea of what would be involved if that work were tobe transferred to another agency or agencies, may be had by reference to theAppendix, which outlines the framework of the Council as it now is, its relation toGovernment Departments, the types of establishment it maintains in the field, andthe subjects they handle.7. It seems clear that the work done by the British Council is an indispensableadjunct to the foreign, colonial and commonwealth policy of His Majesty&apos;s Govern-lnent; and that, if the Council did not exist, His Majesty&apos;s Government would haveto find some other agency or agencies through which to present to other peoples afull and balanced picture of the life and thought of this country as a means of disposing them well towards us, and as a positive alternative to communism, todischarge their obligations to international organisations and under internationaltreaties, and to operate important educational schemes such as that for the welfare of overseas students.8. As regards the second question, in 1946 the Cabinet decided that the balanceof advantage lay on the side of preserving the CounciFs non-official status under certain provisos. Those provisos, as will be seen from paragraph 5 above, havebeen acted upon, and the experience of the past five years of the work in the threeoverseas spheres and in the United Kingdom set out in the Appendix has confirmed the wisdom of this decision. In this connexion it is of interest to note that the Report,of the Select Committee on Estimates (Session 1947-48 Third Report) put as its first recommendation that the work should be carried on under the existing system,and not incorporated in a Government Department (paragraphs 7 and 47 (i) of theCommittee&apos;s Report).9. In the light of the foregoing it is concluded that the continued existenceof the British Council is in the national interest. The work is essentially long-termin its nature, and suffers from any uncertainty as to continuity. Doubt as to its lifemakes it extremely difficult for the Council to recruit or retain the most suitablestaff. In the circumstances it would appear reasonable to prolong the Council&apos;;;existence indefinitely, but that some form of review should take place at, say, theend of ten years, in order to ascertain whether any modifications of the existing organisation and administration are necessary.
1L 2Stability of Income and Effect of Cuts10. It has been pointed out that the CounciPs work is of long term, and thatuncertainty as to the CounciFs future adversely affects both work and staff. but even if it is accepted that the CounciPs existence should be indefinitely prolonged,the Council is handicapped if it does not know from one year to another to withinseveral hundred thousand pounds how much money it will have available. Thisaffects all fields of work, but has particular reference to the Foreign Office grant-in-aid. This grant-in-aid was cut by  343,000 in 1948,  19,000 in 1949,  325,000 in1950 and  364,000 in the current year. The total estimated expenditure for thecurrent year is  2,650,000, of which the Foreign Office grant-in-aid is  1,862,000.In terms of activities, these successive cuts have, over and above economies that could be effected without undue sacrifice, caused inroads into valuable work which include the following: withdrawal from three Latin American countries andmore than halving the work in the remainder; withdrawal from Iceland, theSudan and (except for one school) Ethiopia; the closure of two centres in Persia,two in Egypt, two in Turkey, three in Italy, one in Greece, one in Austria, one in portugal, five in France and the Benelux countries; postponement of projecteddevelopment in India and Pakistan; a reduction of 28 per cent, in the number ofscholarships and 49 per cent, in the value of bursaries, a reduction of 25 per cent,in the current year alone in the supply of books, and abandonment of commissioningnew Council films.11. These reductions were not finally determined until the Estimates were due to be submitted to the Treasury. This is disturbing in its effect on the staff and wasteful in its effects on the work. The recruitment and retention of a fairproportion of permanent or at least semi-permanent staff of the right qualityis essential. Many of the CounciPs operations, both in the artistic and the educational spheres, require long-term commitments and a good deal of planningahead. The work involves leases and contracts, most of which must be based onthe academic year, which cuts across the financial year, and these make up asubstantial part of the overseas expenditure. Educational facilities at universities and colleges can rarely be arranged at short notice. Sudden cuts on such commit-ments yield only a portion of their value in the immediate year, with the resultthat the Council is forced to cut what in a full year represents more, and to selecteconomies for their immediate yield rather than their relative importance. TheCouncil was extravagant in the years preceding the Cabinet review of 1946, but under the present full-time Chairman, who was appointed in that year, and theadvice of Government Departments things have been put right, and this shouldbe all the more reason to avoid now what militates against sound planning.12. In the Commonwealth and the Colonies the effect of this financialuncertainty is also detrimental. During the period under review it had been agreed by the Overseas Departments that an expansion in these fields during the nextfew years was necessary, in consequence of the grant of autonomy to India,Pakistan and Ceylon and the diminution of political control from the UnitedKingdom in Colonial territories referred to in the last sentence of paragraph 15of the Appendix. But sudden limitations imposed upon the CounciPs expenditurehave militated against the application of any orderly long-term programme of expansion.13. The non-official members of the CounciPs Executive Committee, onlearning of the nature of the cut likely to be imposed this year, circulated a memo-randum on 5th January, 1951, to the nine Ministers nominating the official membersof the Committee. They later sent a deputation to interview the Prime minister on 6th February and put forward three requests: (1) to be able to plan the workon a stable basis over a period of years; (2) to be able to establish the staff on apermanent footing with a defined and permanent field of activity; and (3) to be consulted at an early stage when the CounciPs affairs are under discussion by government Departments.14. Clearly it is not possible for His Majesty&apos;s Government to bind themselves as to what the British Council may be allowed to spend in future years. Never-theless, in the interests of enabling the Council to carry out its essentially long-termwork with suitable staff, we consider that some form of stabilisation of its authorisedincome is essential. We therefore suggest that the Overseas Departments be instructed to work out, in consultation with the Treasury, a reasonable minimum40963 B 2
below which, subject to exceptional circumstances, the income of the Council shouldnot over a number of years be permitted to fall.15. Our colleagues may feel that in the course of this examination attention should be given to the size of the CounciFs headquarters&quot; staff in this country. Thisis a point to which public criticism has been directed in the past; and, althoughsubstantial reductions have been made since the Select Committee on Estimatesdrew attention to the matter in 1948, it is conceivable that there may be room forsome further small economy.H. M.J. G.P. C. G. W.appendix the British Council&apos;s Organisation, Relation to GovernmentDepartments and Method of work. The governing body is an Executive Committee of 30 members, containingMembers of Parliament, distinguished persons from the principal fields of education,art, science, the Trades Union Congress, &amp;c, and 9 nominees of GovernmentDepartments, including, of course, the three Overseas Departments. Its Chairmanis also the Director-General of the Council&apos;s regular executive organisation, and is thus a whole-time salaried official. He is appointed by the Executive Committeeafter consultation with the Foreign Secretary. A number of Advisory Committees,consisting of persons distinguished in certain branches of learning, art, science,medicine, &amp;c, serving in a voluntary capacity, advise the Council on their particularsubjects. The regular staff in the London office, partly headquarters proper andpartly departments supplying material for use in the field or performing executive functions of educational work, are in constant touch at various levels with the overseas and other Government Departments.2. The Council is represented in 34 foreign countries, 16 colonies and 5 self-governing States of the Commonwealth.3. As regards financial control, the Council administers a grant-in-aid forthe Foreign Office. All activities financed from the grant-in-aid which are new,or are extended to a new territory, or which involve a question of financial principle,all projects costing  5,000 or over, and all posts involving a salary of  1,000 ormore require individual Treasury sanction, which must be applied for through theForeign Office. The Council works for the Commonwealth Relations Office andthe Colonial Office, for technical reasons, on an agency basis. It follows fromthis that financial control is close. The recent Report of the Organisation and methods Division of the Treasury (November 1950&quot;), which was confined mainly to the CounciFs headquarters in London, confirmed that the Council was&quot; operating economically with clear practical objectives and with a good standardof financial control.&quot; Representatives of the Overseas Departments sit on thecommittee which prepares the annual budget. The CounciFs Representativesabroad are under instructions to keep close touch with His Majesty&apos;s Missions,and the latter receive copies of their annual budget proposals and forward themto London with their comments. His Majesty&apos;s Missions in foreign countries will shortly receive instructions to include in their quarterly reports on Informationmatters a section on the work and administration of the British Council and togive particular attention to their supervision of its activities. A scheme has recentlybeen accepted by the Council whereby the Foreign Office Inspectors, wheninspecting His Majesty&apos;s Missions abroad, also inspect the CounciFs establishments.The Inspectors&apos; reports on the CounciFs establishments are sent both to the ForeignOffice and to the Council.4. The CounciFs work in the artistic and literary spheres is by no means theprincipal part of its activities. Expenditure on fine arts, music, drama, books,periodicals and films in 1950-51 amounted to slightly under 10 per cent, of the totalexpenditure. Of these, moreover, books and periodicals are supplied to librariesas a necessary accompaniment to promoting a wider knowledge of the UnitedKingdom and the English language, and the films are documentary, mostly suitable
for use as complements to lectures, and include special medical and scientific films.The rest is spent on education, science, the teaching of English, the care of overseasvisitors and students, and publicising ourselves and our various contributions todemocratic civilisation. Education includes teaching the English language, subsidies to British schools abroad, subsidisation of posts of university and school-teachingstaff held by British subjects in institutions of other countries, and bringing overto this country, on scholarships and bursaries, students (mostly post-graduate),technicians, trade unionists, manual workers, nurses, &amp;c, for the study and practiceof our methods. English teaching includes summer schools for foreign teachersof English and, when invited, advising foreign educational authorities on the subject.An important element throughout is the liaison work of putting individuals and bodies overseas in touch with their counterparts in this country; this has particular reference to work in countries whose state of development approximates most closely to our own.5. The organisation maintained to handle this work overseas consists, first and foremost, of the CounciFs Institute or Centre. This as a rule contains a library,reading room, hall for lectures, debates, film shows, concerts, exhibitions, androoms for study groups and classes. In certain places the Council is an agency for the holding of British examinations such as the London Matriculation and theCambridge English examinations. English teaching is concentrated mainly onteaching the teachers, and is generally confined to countries where the standardattained in the local education system is unsatisfactory. In a number of places,instead of a Council Institute or Centre, the organisation takes the form of ananglophile club, supported by local subscription and possibly a Council subsidy,to which the Council supplies the secretary and other key positions. These anglo-phile societies (e.g., in Latin America) are often largely occupied with the teaching of English.6. In the United Kingdom the Council maintains establishments in several,mainly university, towns for the benefit of overseas students and visitors. Thereis in most cases a Council Centre in which activities similar to those in the Institutesand Centres abroad are conducted, except that English classes and examinationsare not held, the library is a less important feature, and instead there are a canteenand student welfare activities with recreational facilities. In certain towns there is,in addition, a students&apos; hostel and welfare centre..Work in Foreign Countries7. Since the Cabinet decision of 1946, the changes in the world political situa-tion have given a new emphasis to the Council&apos;s purpose and activities. The taskdefined in the Council&apos;s Charter as &quot; promoting a wider knowledge of the UnitedKingdom &quot; is now in fact bound up with the wider task of defending Westerncivilisation against the inroads of communism by presenting a positive alternative.The Communist countries have paid their tribute to this by preventing the CounciFsestablishment in the U.S.S.R. and Roumania, and expelling it from Czechoslovakia,Hungary, and Bulgaria. The development of the &quot; cold war &quot; and of defensivegroups such as Western Union on the one hand, and the growth of United NationsSpecialised Agencies and cultural conventions on the other, have added consider-ably to the CounciFs responsibilities. The Brussels Treaty and the Council ofEurope both involve cultural work which His Majesty&apos;s Government looks in part to the Council to discharge; and the Council is generally His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs principal nominated agency for the implementation of cultural conventionssigned since the war.8. The CounciFs work is also&apos; of benefit to British trade. It is significant thatthe Shell Company are (anonymously) financing the CounciFs representation inVenezuela rather than see it withdrawn (as it would have been on grounds of economy). Concrete examples of trade benefits are a half million pound order which resulted from the CounciFs work on anaesthesia in Italy and many orders for technical equipment which followed the CounciFs work in Turkey, Chile, and elsewhere.9. Experience of the work in foreign countries has shown that the CounciFsnon-official status bestows three signal advantages. It removes the taint of politicalpropaganda; it permits access to groups and institutions (e.g., universities, profes-sional associations, trade unions) which would be much less accessible to an official
body; a^d it enables the Council to stand aloof from the political estrangementswhich from time to time beset the course of official international relations. TheCouncil have been able to develop techniques which an ordinary GovernmentDepartment cannot possess. An example of what this may mean is the Councilswork in Yugoslavia. In the years immediately following the war, when Yugoslavofficial co-operation was almost entirely lacking, the Council was able to preservemany contacts which would have been denied to British officials and thus to con-tinue its work and turn things to account when official relations improved. Thefollowing is an extract from a report in the Christian Science Monitor of27th April last by their Special Correspondent in Belgrade on Yugoslavia^ rapid development of cultural ties with the West and the abolition of Russian as a compulsory second language. &quot;. . . Within a month, enthusiastic but overworkedofficials of the British Council, a cultural organisation working in foreign countries with the support of the British Government, were able to report that 80 per cent, ofthe students were choosing English. Since then, interest in the English language and,through the language, in English history, literature, natural science and the arts, aswell as present British political experience has &apos; swept the country.&apos; In twelvemonths the British here, through their Embassy and the British Council, havechalked up a record of non-political cultural achievement in Yugoslavia without aparallel in any Communist country since the Russian Revolution.&quot;Work in the Commonwealth10. In the Commonwealth the Council has Representatives and offices inAustralia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan and Ceylon, and although, for political andfinancial reasons, there are no Representatives as yet in South Africa and Canada,certain services such as lecturers, exhibitions, &amp;c, are provided direct from London.11. The work of the Council in the Commonwealth is still in its infancy.The oldest post, Australia, was set up only five years ago, and the latest, Ceylon,in 1950. This extension of Council activity has been the direct result of invitationsof the Commonwealth countries concerned.12. The Council has a very definite role in strengthening Commonwealth links.Even in a country like New Zealand, where the British tradition is strong, it cannotbe assumed that this will always remain so. Both New Zealand and Australia feelisolated from the United Kingdom and there is a danger, already apparent inAustralia, that the traditional ties may weaken.13. In the Asian countries of the Commonwealth it is vital to retain and develop, through all possible means, the British connection. On the success of thislargely depend the links of those countries with the West. The positive expositionof Western thought through literature, the arts and science can do much to resist the influence of Communism and help to consolidate the goodwill of thosecountries towards the United Kingdom which at present is very marked, but whichmay not persist automatically. It must also be remembered that in India Englishwill, in some years&apos; time, cease to be an official language and this may lead to thelowering of the standard of English teaching in the Universities and Colleges, andgeneral decline of interest in English culture. The Council can do much to counter-act this tendency.14. It has been suggested that this cultural work could be handled by theofficial Information Services and by cultural attaches. No doubt certain routineservices could be dealt with in this way, but these are the least important side of theCouncil&apos;s work. The particular value of the Council rests on its close links withacademic, artistic and professional circles with which it can collaborate much morefreely and with greater effect than would be possible if it were a purely official body.Work in the Colonies15. The same can be said of work in the Colonies. Sir Findlater Stewart, inhis report, compared the work of the Council in the Colonies with its activities inforeign countries in the following terms:  &quot; The work of the Council in the Coloniesstands on a different footing from the work in foreign countries. In the latterthe Council has not, and cannot have, the responsibility for the educational orcultural advancement of the people except for the limited purpose of showingthem the British way of life. The cultural advancement of colonial peoples andthe promotion of their cultural relations with this country are parts of a single task
and responsibility for it rests with the Secretary of State for the Colonies and wouldso rest if there were no British Council.&quot; The position has changed very greatlysince these words were written, and a rather different assessment of the situation isrequired to-day. Over the whole colonial field there have been notable advancestowards local self-government in domestic affairs, and this process is becomingintensified. If the colonial peoples are to remain in contented association with theUnited Kingdom as they become politically mature, it is essential to keep beforethem, and particularly before the influential sections of the colonial communities,the value of the British connexion, to foster co-operation between the variousracial elements in the communities, and to strengthen the ties of culture and tradi-tion on which we must increasingly rely as political control from the UnitedKingdom is withdrawn.16. The British Council has proved to be the most efficient and the most acceptable instrument for promoting such mutual understanding, and its workbecomes more necessary as the executive governments in the Colonies become more representative of the local population and less an agency for carrying outcentrally-controlled policy. The very circumstances which make this work more necessary render it impracticable for it to be done by any existing department ofGovernment, and the more desirable that it should be done by the existing non-official agency rather than by any new agency to be created for the purpose. a recent enquiry addressed to the Governors of all colonial territories where theCouncil is operating, or is about to start operations, produced a unanimoustestimony to the need for the Councils work and, in the case of many territories,pressing requests for the extension of its activities. Over a wide range of this work, the Council must clearly employ the same techniques in relation to theColonies as in relation to foreign countries and Commonwealth States, and it should therefore have reasonable freedom to plan and execute its operations as a whole,subject to directives from the Government Department concerned.Work in the United Kingdom17. The work of the Council in the United Kingdom is an essential comple-ment to its work overseas.18. The arrangements made through the Council for the reception and guidance of students, visitors and bursars are an invaluable means of creatingpositive goodwill towards Britain and of counteracting the efforts of subversivepropagandists. The special suitability of the Council for looking after colonial and other overseas students, and bringing a healthy influence to bear upon them,was a governing factor in the decision to transfer to the Council from the ColonialOffice the administration and executive duties of looking after colonial students and providing accommodation and welfare services for them. This was recognised by the Official Committee set up to consider the Welfare of Overseas Students,whose conclusions were accepted by Ministers (Gen. 231 / 3rd Meeting, Minute 4,19th December, 1949). The benefit of this work is to a large extent shared by commonwealth and foreign students and other visitors. A particular object of putting this work on to an effective footing, free from the accusation of &quot; patron-age &quot; and from the disadvantages of the segregation of students by race, nationality,&amp;c, by entrusting it to the British Council was the necessity to combat communist propaganda, to which it has been found that overseas students without contacts inthis country, especially colonials, are in nearly all cases subjected. By reception and welfare arrangements, and help in finding suitable accommodation, this danger has in one year&apos;s working been considerably offset.19. The Council is His Majesty&apos;s Government^ agency for arranging the programmes of Fellows sent to this country by the United Nations specialised agencies, and visitors studying conditions and techniques here under arrangementsconnected with President Truman&apos;s Fourth Point and the Colombo Plan.
