this   DOCUMENT  IS THE   PROPERTY   of  HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS  GOVERNSPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1951SECRET Copy No.CP. (51) 26622nd October. 195!CABINETBILATERAL   AND   TRIPARTITE   TALKS   IN   WASHINGTON    ANDATLANTIC COUNCIL MEETING IN OTTAWA10th-20th SEPTEMBER, 1951Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of DefenceIntroductionOur colleagues will recall that in a recent paper (CP. (51) 239) the PrimeMinister gave an outline of the various international problems which would becoming up for discussion during the meetings which were to be held in north america in September and of the policy of Hi6 Majesy&apos;s Government towards them.   We now wish to give the Cabinet a brief report of these meetings.2. The Foreign Secretary left the United Kingdom on 6th September toattend the Japanese Peace Conference at San Francisco. He then flew to washington for conversations first with Mr. Acheson alone and then withMr. Acheson and M. Schuman, in both of which he was joined by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, who was at the same time attending a parallel series of talks in connexion with the International Monetary Fund. The&quot; Secretary of Stateand the Chancellor of the Exchequer then flew to Ottawa on 14th Septemberwhere, together with the Minister of Defence they attended the seventh session ofthe North Atlantic Council, which concluded on 20th September.3. A separate report will be prepared on the San Francisco Conference.The present report will, therefore, cover only the bilateral and tripartite talks in Washington and the Atlantic Council meeting at Ottawa.4. The four main achievements of the Washington and Ottawa Talks werein respect of Germany, Turkey and Greece and the Middle East Command, thefinancial aspects of defence, and Korea.5. On Germany we reached tripartite agreement on the next stage of thenegotiations with the German Federal Government for the replacement of thepresent occupation regime by a new contractual relationship (see Section I below).6. On Turkey and Greece and the Middle East Command, there was agree-ment in the Atlantic Council to recommend to governments the admission of greece and Turkey to the North Atlantic Treaty and also agreement between theUnited States and ourselves on the establishment of a Middle East command and a joint invitation to Turkey to join it (see Section II).7. On the financial aspects of defence we put before the Americans thebalance of payments difficulties of the United Kingdom and the Sterling Area and explained that these might interfere with the fulfilment of our  4,700 millionprogramme, and in any case made it impossible for us to contemplate acceptingany further burdens. The action taken was to establish a twelve-power N.A.T.O.committee of so-called &quot; wise men &quot; to study, over the next two months, the wholequestion of financing the N.A.T.O. defence effort (see Section III).41358 b
8. On Korea the Americans gave us their views on the future conduct ofthe campaign and we were able to impress on them the need for caution if the korean war was not to grow into a world war with Russia (see general discussion on the Far East, Section IV below).9. Other principal issues discussed were: the Italian Peace Treaty and Trieste,Austria, Spain, Persia, policy towards the satellites, availability of defence forces,development of the non-defence aspects of N.A.T.O., and the frequency oh and.attendance at, future Council meetings (see Sections V-X1I below).I. Germany10. At their last meeting in Brussels in December 1950 the three occupying powers reached agreement on a three-fold programme: - -(a) At the invitation of the Atlantic Council they instructed the three high commissioners to hold exploratory discussions with the federal government regarding German participation in the defence of western europe;(b) they took note of the intention of the French Government to call aconference in Paris to discuss the &quot; Pleven Plan&quot; for a european army;(c) they instructed the three High Commissioners to begin explanatory discussions with the German Federal Government on the replacement of the existing occupation regime by a new contractual relationship.11. As a result of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s talks at Washington withMr. Acheson and M. Schuman, this programme has now been carried a stage further.German Contribution to Western Defence12. We considered the High Commissioners&apos; report of their discussions withthe German Federal Government, the so-called &quot; Bonn Report,&quot; and agreed that,pending further developments at the European Army Conference in Paris, discus-sions with the German Federal Government should be suspended and the &quot; BonnReport &quot; put into cold storage.European Army13. M. Schuman explained the progress which had been made at the paris conference. Apart from the French Government, the German and Italian Govern-ments had now agreed in principle to the establishment of a European army to include a German contingent. The military details of the European army were now being worked out by military, financial and juridical sub-committees of the Conference, and it was hoped to submit to the next meeting of the atlantic council in Rome in November a set of concrete practical proposals for theimmediate creation of a European Army. M. Schuman was at pains to emphasise the genuinely international character of the European Army and the sacrificeswhich it would involve for France. Once there was a European Army, france would cease to have a national army except for the defence of her overseas territories. M. Schuman also represented strongly the French view that no steps should be taken to raise German units or to put a single German into uniformexcept as part of a European Army. Finally. M. Schuman declared that in all matters of military detail including the size of national units the French Govern-ment would be guided by the advice of military experts, including general eisenhower.14. Mr. Acheson made it quite clear that the European Army conceptionhad the- full backing of the United States Government, who had been convincedby General Eisenhower that is was a militarily practicable proposal.15. As a result of the previous Cabinet decision on 4th September (C.C. (51)58th meeting) the Foreign Secretary was able to assure Mr. Acheson andM. Schuman that His Majesty&apos;s Government were disposed to favour the plan for a European Army, of which German forces would form part, that we agreedthat the working out of its military arrangements must be undertaken by the paris conference in consulation with General Eisenhower, and that in order to assist in this work we were sending high-level military observers to Paris. At the sametime he reserved our right to call for more intimate tripartite discussions if this
should appear necessary and made it clear that we expected the Atlantic auies toreceive preference over Germany in the supply of arms and equipment.16. Our intervention in favour of the European Army, which was subsequently repeated in the Atlantic Council, undoubtedly gave great pleasure tothe French. It was also welcomed by the Americans and there can be no doubtthat it was the right course of action. By our acceptance in principle of theEuropean Army we have re-established three power unity on the question ofGerman defence.Contractual Relations with Germany17. Before Ministers got to Washington, officials of the three governments had prepared for their consideration a draft of detailed instructions to guide thethree Allied High Commissioners in their negotiations with the German federal government for the replacement of the Occupation regime by a new contractualrelationship. This draft followed the general lines foreshadowed in the PrimeMinister^ memorandum CP. (51) 240 of 30th August. The Foreign Ministers,were able at their meetings to resolve outstanding differences and to give final approval to these instructions. They have now been issued, and the three high commissioners have begun their negotiations with the Germans. The basis ofthese instructions is that the objective should be to establish a firm political basis for our relations with the German Federal Republic, which could be maintaineduntil a peace settlement with a unified Germany became possible; and that only such safeguards should be retained as were essential and could be maintainedeffectively for an extended period of years. The three powers would be ready in the framework of the contractual arrangements to abolish the occupation statute and to replace the High Commission by a Council of Ambassadors. Theywould exercise their supreme authority only in order to discharge their responsibilities -ties regarding Germany as a whole, to deal with questions relating to Berlin,and to station forces in Germany and protect the security of these forces. Theywould retain the right to declare a state of emergency and take any necessary-action in the event of a threat to public or constitutional order constituting a menace to the security of their forces. The Allied forces in Germany would nolonger be forces in occupation of the territory of a defeated enemy but forcesco-operating in the common defence to which the Federal Republic will be con-tributing as a partner; and their status should, so far as possible, be assimilatedto that of friendly forces stationed in an Allied country. This would involvechanges in the field of jurisdiction, for instance the abolition of existing Alliedcourts in Germany.18. In all other fields Allied relations with Germany would be placed upona basis of agreement and consent to be regulated by the various detailed contracts to be negotiated. In the field of restrictions on German industry, it is proposedthat the German Federal Government should be asked to agree in the contracts to maintain certain minimum prohibitions, primarily of a military nature, basedupon the list drawn up by the North Atlantic Council in Brussels last December,they would also be asked to accord the Allies the necessary minimum rights ofverification and inspection. A meeting of representatives of the three Govern-ments at official level is to take place shortly in London to define and clarifythese restrictions on production.19. A tripartite meeting of officials is also to be held in London to consider further the difficult problems involved in the financial field as a result of german participation in Western defence. The Foreign Secretary will shortly be circulating a paper on this subject.20. The idea emerged at the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting that at the timeof any such further meeting with the German Chancellor it might be desirableto issue a joint declaration which would define the political principles upon whichthe arrangements as a whole were based. Such a declaration might also reaffirm the security guarantee of the Federal Republic and Berlinoriginally given in the New York communique of 19th September, 1950.&apos;In addition it might contain some assurance of the intention of the Allies to maintaintroops in Germany in sufficient strength to deter Soviet aggression. No finaldecision was reached in these matters which will call for further consideration.21.   The Americans optimistically hope that the negotiations with the german federal Government will be concluded within the next two months so that a41358 B 2
treaty can be signed before the Rome meeting of the Atlantic Council at the endof November. It seems very doubtful whether we shall be able to keep to sucha tight timetable: we have nevertheless now at last set in motion a process whichshould enable the Allied Powers to carry forward a further important stage oftheir policy of incorporating Western Germany as an equal member in the western european Community.Declaration on Germany22. At the conclusion of the tripartite meetings in Washington, the threeForeign Ministers issued a public declaration setting out in general terms the broadobjectives of their German policy. This declaration says that the aim of the three governments is &quot; the inclusion of a democratic Germany, on a basis of equality,in a continental European community, which itself will form part of a constantlydeveloping Atlantic community.&quot; The declaration then goes on to pay tribute to the Schuman and Pleven Plans and today that the United Kingdom &quot; desires to establish the closest possible association with the European continental communityat all stages in its development.&quot; It concludes with a reaffirmation of the peaceful and defensive purposes of the North Atlantic Treaty. From the public point otview, this declaration has had three important results. In the first place, it has put in its proper perspective the Allied decision to modify the Occupation regime and to rearm Germany as one step in the developing process of achieving european unity. Secondly, it is the first formal recognition by the United States and france of the special position of the United Kingdom in relation to European unity, andof our inability to integrate fully with Europe. Finally, by removing any ambiguityon this score and laying down clearly that while we cannot join the &quot; european community &quot; we nevertheless wish to be closely associated with it, the declarationhas succeeded in dissipating the distrust and suspicion of our policy in europe which has for so long been embittering Anglo-French relations.Benelux23. Mr. Acheson, M. Schuman and the Foreign Secretary were careful tokeep Benelux fully informed of our negotiations with regard to Germany, not only through officials but also through personal meetings with their Foreign ministers in Ottawa.   They gave their full approval to our decisions.II. Turkey and Greece and the Middle East Command24. Our colleagues will recall that the Cabinet only agreed to the admissionof Turkey and Greece to the North Atlantic Treaty on the assumption that we obtained in return Allied, and in particular American, agreement on the settingup of a Middle East Command, including Turkey, under a British Supreme Com-mander. Our object at the Washington and Ottawa meetings was therefore to try and get the tightest possible agreement on the Middle East Command arrangementsbefore we gave our vote at the Atlantic Council for the admission of Turkey and greece to N.A.T.O. In the event, this proved to be perhaps the most difficult jobof the conference.25. As far as the admission of Greece and Turkey to the North atlantic treaty was concerned, there was no real opposition ecept for pro forma protests from Norway, and Denmark and, to a lesser extent, Holland. Al its last meetingon 20th September the Council passed a resolution recommending each Govern-ment to &quot; take whatever steps may be necessary to enable it to agree that the kingdom of Greece and the Republic of Turkey be invited to accede to the north atlantic Treaty and thereupon notify its agreement to the Government of theUnited States.&quot; The effect of this resolution is to leave the final decision on the admission of Turkey and Greece to national Governments and Parliaments, and turkey and Greece can, therefore, only become members of the Treaty when allParliaments and Governments have formally notified their approval.26. On the Middle East Command, on the other hand, we ran into serious difficulties with the Americans, the French, and some of the smaller Atlantic Powersled by Holland.27. The Americans have never been quite solid.on the subject of the middle east Command, nor shared our view that Turkey belongs primarily to the middle east and is essential to its defence. They have tended rather to emphasise Turkey^s
value to Europe. Their chief anxiety is to secure Turkish military strength for theWest and they do not seem to mind very much, and certainly not as much as we do,whether that strength is contributed through a Middle East Command or throughGeneral eisenhower&apos;s European Command. Our job was, therefore, to convince them not only that a Middle East Command is essential to the solution of our jointdifficulties in the Middle East (especially in Egypt), but also that, without Turkey,it is military nonsense.  In this we were on the whole successful.28. As a result of the Washington and Ottawa talks they agreed, not only tojoin with us in presenting the Middle East Command proposals to the Turks, butalso to send General Bradley to Ankara to join with Field-Marshal Slim in pressingthem on the Turkish Government. They also agreed to join with us in an invitation to Egypt to take part in the Command organisation as a founder member. In orderto get this much, however, we were obliged to agree that, as far as the defence ofTurkey is concerned, the Supreme Allied Commander, Middle East, should beresponsible to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation while remaining outsideN.A.T.O. for purposes of the defence of the rest of the Middle East. We thinkthat we can be satisfied that this arrangement can be made to work in practice.It must be remembered, however that the Americans are less attached to the ideaof a Middle East Command than we are, and may not be willing to keep uppressure on the Turks throughout the negotiations which still have to take place before the Command is established.29. Rather to our surprise, the French, who had most to gain by beingassociated with a Middle East Command (since they have hitherto been excludedfrom defence planning in the Middle East) and the least to contribute to it, also made difficulties from the start. They saw the importance which we, and to a lesser extent, the Americans, attach to the establishment of this Command, and evidentlythought the opportunity good to blackmail us into giving way to them on points of purely French national interest. M. Schuinan said that he could only accept theproposed Command arrangements (including the British Supreme Commander) on two conditions:  (a) That a French officer was given a high appointment at the Supreme Com-mander&apos;s Headquarters; and(b) That in order to balance the British naval command in the eastern mediterranean a French Admiral was given the naval command in theWestern Mediterranean.30. The first French condition caused little difficulty. After consulting theChiefs of Staff, the Minister of Defence and the Foreign Secretary were able toagree that a French officer of the rank of Major-General or Vice-Admiral shouldbe appointed to the Supreme Commander&apos;s Headquarters. Mr. Acheson also agreed. The second French condition was more difficult to meet. The americans were unwilling to accept a French naval command in the Western Mediterraneanas they considered that this would interfere with the control of naval operations on general Eisenhower&apos;s Southern Flank, which had been entrusted &quot;to AdmiralCarney.31. The proposal also presented difficulties from our own point of viewinasmuch as the British Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, will need to beresponsible for east-west communications in the Western Mediterranean if he isproperly to fulfil his task of supporting the Supreme Commander, Middle East, inthe Eastern Mediterranean. In spite of two special tripartite ministerial meetings,it was impossible to reconcile these view either at Washington or Ottawa. No agree-ment was therefore reached and we were obliged to leave Ottawa without havingobtained the agreement of the French Government to our Middle East Commandproposals. It was left that Field Marshal Slim and General Bradley would visitParis on their way to Ankara and try to reach agreement on the Western Mediter-ranean in consultation with their French colleagues and with General Eisenhower sothat a French General could join them in their mission to Turkey. The Paris talkswould also have as their object the finding of an acceptable military solution of theproblem of the responsibility for Turkish defence referred to in paragraph 27 above.(See footnote * below.)* Tripartite agreement was subsequently reached in Paris on a formula, whereby, Turkey, although a member of N.A.T.O., &quot;would be primarily associated with arrangements for the defence of theMiddle East,&quot; But the latest reports from Ankara indicate that Turkey is still holding out forparticipation in General eisenhower&apos;s command as the first step in her admission to N.A.T.O.
III. Financial Aspects of Defence33. What we had expected to achieve at Ottawa was a realistic &quot; confronta-tion &quot; of the military and financial implications of the defence effort which would cause N.A.T.O. as a whole to review its plans and to work out a balance betweenthe requirements of security and of economic stability in the twelve countries. Ourparticular objective as far as the United Kingdom was concerned was to make clear to the United States administration the seriousness of the impact of our present defence programme on our economy, and to resist any suggestion that we could do more unless there were to be radical changes of policy in the direction of a wareconomy both internally in each member country and in their financial relationship with each other.34.   Both these objectives were to a relative extent achieved.(a) Exposition of the United Kingdom Situation35. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was able both in Washington and at ottawa to give a full account of the economic and financial position of both theUnited Kingdom and the Sterling Area and thus to illustrate the clash betweenmilitary security and economic stability which is common in some degree to everyN.A.T.O. country. He made it clear that our overall balance of payments deficit,combined with the threat of a severe dollar crisis, were making our situationincreasingly difficult. While production for defence was so far up to schedule, we might be forced, if the external financial position deteriorated further, to increase our exports of gooods produced by the metal-using industries, which could only beat the expense of rearmament orders. There was a danger, therefore, that we mightnot be able to complete our projected three-year  4,700 million defence programme on time; and it was clearly quite out of the question, in present conditions, for usto contemplate anything in the nature of an increase over our present plans. TheChancellor of the Exchequer explained to the Americans at Washington that wecould not accept our forces allocation under the Medium-Term Defence Plan as a realistic target in present circumstances: the existing  4,700 million programme would not even fully equip the forces which we had undertaken to contribute toN.A.T.O. and forces in other parts of the world. Still less could be think in termsof the even higher targets on which General Eisenhower was now understood to be working.36. Our statement was, of course, borne out by the analysis of the UnitedKingdom situation in the F.E.B. Report, which concludes that &quot;the effective limit to the United Kingdom defence programme is set by the dangers to its external financial position which an even larger programme of defence production would entail.&quot; We have, it appears, convincingly carried our point both to the americans and to N.A.T.O. as a whole that we can undertake no further efforts without eithermore external aid or taking the drastic step of turning ov.er to a virtual war economy.lb) French Position37. M. Mayer, the French Finance Minister, made it equally clear both in washington and Ottawa that France had reached the limit of her capacity forrearmament in present conditions. French industry was working at full pitchwherever practicable, but dependence on raw materials, and especially fuel imports,32. The objections of the smaller Atlantic Powers to the proposed Middle east command were of a different kind. They arose from the fear that by her inclusion in a special command all of her own Turkey would enjoy a privileged position andescape the common scrutiny of her defence effort to which all other N.A.T.O. powers are subject. It was only with great reluctance that some of the smaller countries,especially Norway, Denmark and Holland, agreed to accept Turkey into N.A.T.O.at all. Led by M. Stikker, they argued strongly that they could only do so if theywere convinced that Turkey would be subject to exactly the same obligations asthey are themselves. In order to appease this body of small Power opinion, it wasnecessary for us to agree first that all matters affecting the defence of Turkey wouldbe subject to the control of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (this was thesame point which the Americans had made, for different reasons); and, secondly,that the smaller Powers should be kept fully informed through the Council Deputiesof the progress of three-Power discussions with the Turks.
from dollar sources, particularly in the steel industry, was an important limiting factor. France had still not completed her reconstruction programme; her defence programme affected home consumption, with the resulting danger of inflation, aswell as exports; and her resources in money and men were being drained by thewar in Indo-China. The French dollar situation was serious, and M. Mayer said he was convinced the French Government would have to determine a maximumlimit beyond which they could not carry their total defence effort without creating a disastrous inflationary deficit and endangering the currency, with fatal economicand social results, which would defeat the very objectives we sought to attain. Hepleaded finally for further integration of the defence programmes of the UnitedStates and Europe by making the best possible use of our joint industrial capacity,in particular by further placing of orders in European factories and by off-shorepurchases by the United States.(c) The &quot; Wise Men &quot; and Prospects for the Immediate Future38. Discussion around the F.E.B. Report on the position of individualN.A.T.O. countries, and its recommendations for national and international actionto increase productivity and maintain economic stability, despite the claims ofthe defence effort, had the effect which we had been seeking: to bring face to face the discrepancies between economic and financial possibilities and military needs,and to make it clear to the United States that what was required was to examine and &quot; confront &quot; these two aspects of the problem and see what conclusions shouldbe drawn. Time at Ottawa was too short, of course, to enable an exercise of this magnitude to be carried out in detail. The concrete outcome of the discussions inthe Council was the adoption of a proposal, originally put forward in a rather different form by the French, to set up a temporary committee of the Council &quot; to analyse the issues involved in reconciling, on the one hand, the requirements of external security .... and, on the other, the realistic politico-military capabilitiesof member countries.&quot; This committee (sometimes referred to jocularly as the&quot; Wise Men &quot;) will consist of representatives of all twelve countries, of ministerialor near-ministerial rank, who will be responsible for all negotiations with theGovernments concerned. There will also be a small Steering Group or ExecutiveBureau, composed of the American Chairman of the full Committee and the Britishand French Vice-Chairmen, to steer and expedite the work. All the military and civil agencies of N.A.T.O. are directed to co-operate with the committee in pro-ducing the military, production, financial and economic data required to build upa composite picture of the defence effort. The first step is for the Standing group to estimate the military requirements for the defence of the North Atlantic Treatyarea, and to make recommendations, again from the military point of view, for meeting those requirements. When this and information about economic capabili-ties are available, the Committee will be able to begin the actual task of &quot; confron-tation.&quot; A progress report will be made to the next North Atlantic Council meetingat Rome in November and a full analysis of the committee&apos;s findings is scheduledfor 1st December. (The Committee began its meetings in Paris on 9th October.The United Kingdom has been represented at these meetings by the Chancellorof the Exchequer or, in his absence, by Sir E. Plowden.)39. Hitherto, N.A.T.O. has worked in what have been water-tight depart-ments dealing with the elementary stages of the finance, defence and productionproblems. This is the first time that any attempt has been made to pull together the threads of these various activities into one pattern. The proposed study will,it is hoped, at last throw up the real difficulties. We have therefore whole-heartedlysupported this initiative, on the assumption that in bringing out more fully the implications of carrying out the defence programme, it will lead to firm and jointconclusions by Governments as to whether: (a) it is consistent with security toreduce the military plan; and / or (b) the economic efforts must be increased bydrastic means, and, if so, how this can be done in full co-operation between thecountries concerned. For the time being it is understood, of course, that countriescarry on uninterruptedly with their planned defence programmes as best they can.(d) Infrastructure40. For several months before the Council Meeting the Deputies had been engaged in fruitless discussions on the division of the cost of an urgent programmeof airfields find communications, known collectively as infrastructure, for thecommon use of the forces defending Western Europe.   Their failure to reach a
solution lay in the refusal of the United States Government, on the one hand,to depart from a &quot; user &quot; formula (under which they would pay no more than couldbe justified to Congress on the basis of direct support for the United States forces)and on the other and continental view that &quot; capacity to pay &quot; must be the decidingfactor.41. Shortly before the Council, the United Kingdom had put forward an arbitrary cost-sharing formula aimed at striking a compromise between these two points of view, but this had not proved acceptable to the Americans. At Ottawa,under the stimulus of a message from General Eisenhower that urgent work wasbeing delayed by the absence of agreement on cost-sharing, a series of meetings between the United States, French and British Ministers resulted in an agreement which was not dissimilar to our proposal and which also proved acceptable to thesmaller countries. Under this agreement towards a total estimated cost of  84-5 million, the United States pay  38 million, we pay  14 million the French pay  17million plus the cost of land, &amp;c, estimated at  4 million, and the other N.A.T.O.countries concerned share the remaining  11-5 million.IV. Far East: Korea, China, Indo-China42. Talks took place between the Foreign Secretary and Mr. Acheson on theFar East on 11th September and on a tripartite basis with M. Schuman on 14thSeptember.Anglo-American Talks43. Mr. Acheson gave an outline of the United States Governments pro-posals for action (a) if the Korea armistice talks were successful and (b) if theybroke down completely.44. The United States Government had not given detailed thought to the steps to be taken // the armistice talks were successful since they were doubtfulwhether political discussions arising out of an armistice could take place in the nearfuture. If political discussions eventually took place they should be confined tothe future of Korea only, between the United Nations on the one side and the NorthKoreans and their supporters on the other. The United Nations should not abandon the principle of a unified and democratic Korea. The United nations had never given their blessing to the political division of Korea and should not nowdo so. The Secretary of State said that he was in general agreement with these views but that three points should be borne in mind:  (a) We should not lose sight of the desirability at a later stage of a wider con-ference to discuss Far Eastern problems as a whole.(b) Political discussions on Korea should not be allowed to give the impression that the United Nations was a purely anti-Communist organisation.Our view was that the United Nations was a world organisation ofwhich countries of all political creeds were members.(c) In considering a political settlement in Korea it was essential to take stepsto ensure that Korea could survive as a democratic State; it would bea pity if any settlement allowed the new Korean Government to be threatened by a Communist fifth column from within. Any settlementmust also cover the question of Chinese representation in the united nations.45. Mr. Acheson considered that the world situation would become muchmore dangerous if the armistice talks broke down completely. In the latter eventand on the advice of their Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States Government pro-posed that: -(i) War production in the United States would be increased.(ii) The scale of operations in Korea should be increased on the assumptionthat General Ridgway would receive reinforcements.(iii) Since a stalemate would have an adverse effect on United Nations troops&apos;morale, General Ridgway should be authorised to take the initiative ina series of battles of manoeuvre and be given discretion to penetrate asfar as the &quot; waist &quot; of Korea.
(iv) Training and rearmament of the Japanese Police Reserve should be expedited and the size of the force increased so that three or fourJapanese Divisions could be formed to carry out internal security duties.(v) The training and equipment of Korean defence forces should be intensified.(vi) All restrictions on the bombing of targets within Korea should beremoved and General Ridgway authorised to bomb the dams across theYalu River and power stations on the south bank of the river providedthat the Manchurian frontier was not crossed.(vii) If major air attacks were made on United Nations forces from bases out-side Korea, General Ridgway should be authorised to carry out stand-ing instructions to eliminate the air bases from which the attacks weremounted.(viii) The Unified Command should report to the United Nations on thearmistice talks, making it clear that the breakdown was the sole respon-sibility of the North Koreans and their associates.(ix) The United Nations should be asked to reaffirm its determination to oppose aggression in Korea and to provide additional help.(x) Members of the United Nations should be asked to support an embargo on all shipments to China and to agree voluntarily to prevent their shipsentering Chinese ports. The United States Government recognisedthat a naval blockade of China was impracticable.46.   The Foreign Secretary then made the following comments:  (a) His Majesty&apos;s Government were anxious not to become involved in a full-scale war in China.(b) Korea was one example of Russian trouble-making and there was no tellingwhere and when she might make trouble next in Asia or elsewhere.Economic and social conditions in the Middle East provided a good opportunity for Russia to make trouble. The Korean war should notbe considered in isolation but as part of a global struggle between theWest and Russia.(c) China was not yet, in our view, proved to be a slavish satellite of the soviet union. We should avoid driving Russia and China closer together and maintain such contacts as we had with the Chinese Government.id) We would prefer to defend the Kansas Line in Korea rather than a line which might not be tactically as favourable.(e) The Foreign Secretary promised to think over the proposal regardingdiscretion to General Ridgway to manoeuvre north of the Kansas Lineup to the &quot; waist.&quot; (Subsequently after consideration in London theState Department was informed that we would prefer that there shouldbe no major advance to the &quot; waist &quot; without specific Governmentalapproval, but that should the enemy become disorganised and demoral-ised, General Ridgway&apos;s hands should not be tied and that in such circumstances an advance by manoeuvre as far as the &quot; waist&quot; but notbeyond, might well be undertaken.)(/) He agreed that a stalemate in Korea would be bad for the morale of theUnited Nations troops.(g) He assumed that the Japanese Police Reserve Divisions would not be usedin Korea but only for internal security duties in Japan. Mr. Achesonconfirmed that this was the intention. (The State Department was subsequently informed that we agreed that the minimum rearming of japanese internal security forces could be undertaken provided equip-ment was not at the expense of other N.A.T.O. countries and if it wasmilitarily necessary to withdraw part of the United States garrison in japan to Korea. We also wished the raising of any such forces to becarried out in such a manner as to prevent any provocation to Russiawhile the Peace Treaty is not in effect.)(h) He agreed that efforts should be made to build up dependable SouthKorean forces.(/) On the bombing of the Yalu dams and power stations we reserved ourposition. (Subsequently, after consultation with London, we informed the United States Government of His Majesty&apos;s Government^ con-currence.   As regards retalliatory bombing of targets in China see41358 c
paragraph 4 (vii) above the United States Government have again been informed that we consider prior consultation essential. They havenot accepted this viewpoint as they consider that a situation might arise in which, for the safety of the United Nation forces, retaliatory bombingwould be necessary but in which time might not permit prior consulta-tion. Discussion with them continues.)(/&apos;) We were glad that the United States Government did not consider a naval blockade practicable. As regards members of the United Nationsbeing asked to stop their ships from calling at Chinese ports, theSecretary of State said that this would cause &quot;us difficulty and that he.would wish to consider the question further. (As the result of furtherconsideration in London the State Department has been informed thatwe would be against an embargo on all shipments to China and on ships entering Chinese ports since this would be tantamount to aneconomic blockade, a policy to which we are opoosed. We are,however, willing to discuss means of strengthening the existing embargounder the United Nations Resolution of 18th May, 1951, and of making it more effective.)(/c) The Foreign Secretary agreed with the proposals made by Mr. Achesonin paragraph 4 (viii) and (ix) above, but pointed out that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would, find it difficult to spare more troops. (The state department were subsequently informed that agreement was con-ditional on any reinforcements not being at the expense of nationalcontributions to N.A.T.O.)Tripartite Talks47. On 14th September M. Schuman joined us in our discussions on the far east. Mr. Acheson and the Secretary of State both put forward, in somewhat more general terms, the points we had already made in the bipartite talks as recordedabove. M. Schuman took note of our statements which he said would requirestudy in Paris. He then referred to Indo-China, where France had two main objects.The first was to obtain the maximum internal support for the agreements between france and the Associate States, and the second was to build up the Viet NamArmy. Great progress had been made with the latter, and the Associate States had decided on general mobilisation in October. The chief danger was Chinese inter-vention in force, especially if there was to be an armistice in Korea which wouldrelease Chinese troops for service elsewhere. It was of paramount importance forthe United States, Britain and France to maintain contact on the situation inSouth-East Asia.48. The Secretary of State assured M, Schuman that the United kingdom was behind France in her struggle in Indo-China and would give her all reasonable and practicable support. Mr. Acheson commented that the United States Govern-ment regarded the maintenance of a strong position in Indo-China as of vitalimportance.General49. Though realistic, Mr. Acheson&apos;s programme for the Far East is funda-mentally cautious, and with some important reservations, particularly on theeconomic side, we have been able substantially, to accept it.V. Italian Peace Treaty and Trieste50. At the tripartite meetings in Washington we reached agreement on the text of the Tripartite Declaration on the revision of the Italian Peace Treaty, and decided that it should be published as soon as we had agreed with the Italians onthe text-of the proposed Italian Note to the signatories of the Treaty. The substance of the Note was agreed at Ottawa and (as our colleagues are aware) the declaration was accordingly issued at Washington on 26th September, during Signor deGasperi&apos;s visit to the United States.51. As regards the time-table for de facto revision, the Americans insisted thatthe final stage,.Le., the favourable reply to the Italian Note, should not be delayedby more than six to eight weeks from the rnoment the Note was presented. Theydid not feel that our agreement to the revision of the Treaty should be dependent
on a settlement of the Trieste issue. The Foreign Secretary made it clear that weattached great importance to bringing Yugoslavia and Italy together and that,though he would agree reluctantly not to make this settlement a condition ofrevision, we must continue to put strong pressure upon them from now on to achieveit. It was important that Italy herself should not know a time limit had been setfor our reply lest she should try to spin out the Trieste negotiations. If sheremained under the apprehension that they were an essential preliminary to revisionof the Treaty she would be much more likely to try to reach a quick settlement.52. The three Foreign Ministers agreed accordingly thai when the Italian Notewas received it would merely receive a sympathetic acknowledgement and that sixto eight weeks might then elapse, during which we should do our utmost ia) to persuade the Italians and the Yugoslavs to settle the Trieste issue, and (b) to ensurethrough diplomatic channels, the co-operation of other signatories, especially India,Yugoslavia, Ethiopia and Greece. We would hope that by then the Trieste issue would have been settled: but whether it had or not we would expect to send notes of reply at the end of this period.   The notes would say:-(a) that so far as our bilateral relations were concerned, and without prejudice to the rights of third parties, we agreed not to enforce certain specifiedarticles of the Treaty;(b) that the moral stigma inherent in the Preamble of the Treaty no longeraffected our bilateral relations.We would hope that other signatories would then do likewise.53. Rather to our surprise the Americans did not seem to be greatly impressed by the argument that the Italian question must be handled in a way so as to cause the least possible offence to Tito. Whether because of internal political con-siderations connected with the Italian vote or for some other reason, the Americansclearly thought that Italy was the better horse to back if it came to a choice. Theircalculation is presumably that Tito has now burnt his boats and is firmly landed onthe Western side.   However, we have probably started them thinking.54. During the Ottawa meetings the Italians also secured the tacit supportof N.A.T.O. for the elimination of any discrimination against them under thePeace Treaty. The Council approved a statement on the North Atlantic Com-munity stating inter alia that all obstacles which hindered co-operation betweenthe NAT. countries on an equal footing should be removed. Signer De Gasperiasked the Council having previously obtained our support and that of the Frenchand Americans for this move to agree that these words should be regarded as applying particularly to Italy. This interpretation was strongly backed byM. Schuman and was not challenged by any member of the Council. It is thus nowcommon ground in N.A.T.O. that our intention is to re-establish italy&apos;s position on an equal footing with other members as soon as this becomes practicable. we did not, of course, accept the view that N.A.T.O. had a locus stundi on revision.VI. Austria55. The Americans at the outset wished the Austrian Deputies to be convenedin October, but Mr. Acheson readily accepted our contention that it would bebetter, if possible, to get the Trieste and Italian issues out of the way if possible before going into a meeting on Austria. It was finally agreed that we should look at the international situation, particularly the situation in Trieste, some time inOctober, and consider the possibility of convening the Deputies in November.VII-Spain56. Both M. Schuman and the Foreign Secretary made it very clear toMr. Acheson that they regretted the recent American approaches to Spain and hoped that the Americans would not go further in their negotiations than wasstrictly necessary. Mr. Acheson told us thai he was fully conscious of the strengthof public opinion in the United Kingdom and in France on this subject. Heassured us that he was trying to keep the negotiations on a minimum basis forthat reason, and that there was no question of trying to bring Spain into N.A.T.O.or Western defence plans. But he pointed out that he too had to reckon with41358 d
public opinion. It would have been difficult for him to justify to the United Statespublic a refusal to negotiate for bases on grounds of principle, and it wouldhave been unwise to yield to United Kingdom and French pressure in this mattersince bitter resentment would have been caused against our two countries. Heassured us that the State Department would keep us fully informed of the progressof the negotiations.VIII-Persia57. On Persia, the Foreign Secretary^ object was not to reach decisions;that would not have been possible in a fluid and changing situation: but rather tohave a general talk with Mr. Acheson and Mr. Harriman and to explain to thempersonally the broad lines of our Persian policy. Mr. Morrison emphasised ourconviction that it was near enough impossible to deal with Mussadeq and that thebest hope lay in an early change of Government. He also made it plain that ifactive steps were taken to expel British subjects from Abadan it would create avery grave situation. Mr. Acheson and Mr. Harriman were both helpful, but therewas inevitably a difference of emphasis between our two points of view. Theywere quite frank in urging us to be patient and conciliatory, and they expressedstrongly the hope that we would not take any precipitate action by pressing the shah too hard for the removal of Mussadeq or by armed intervention.IX. Policy towards the Satellites58. The Americans had inserted in the agenda an item which seemed to pointtowards a desire on their part that we should join them in a more offensive policy towards the Satellite Governments. In the event, Mr. Acheson withdrew this item.Here, it seems, we have another proof of the moderate breeze blowing in Washingtonat the moment.X. Availability  of  Defence  Forces59. At Mr. ShinwelFs suggestion the Defence Ministers met together atone stage during the Ottawa Conference and carried out a useful review of suchmatters as the speed at which reserve forces could be put into the field after D-Day,the provision of equipment and increases in the period of national service.60. At the conclusion of their review, the Defence Ministers accepted a united Kingdom recommendation that an appreciation should be prepared for theMilitary Committee for subsequent submission to the next meeting of the Councilin Rome of the readiness and effectiveness of the forces allocated to N.A.T.O. whichwould be immediately available in the event of war.61. In addition to this appreciation, the Council called for the submission toits next meeting in Rome of an estimate of the relative strength and capabilitiesof the forces of N.A.T.O. and of the Soviet bloc at present and in the immediatefuture. This estimate may well serve as a useful background for our discussions at Rome.XI. Development of non-Defence Aspects of N.A.T.O.62. At Ottawa the Americans put forward important proposals, of whichthey had previously given us warning, for developing the &quot; non-defence &quot; aspects ofN.A.T.O. The suggestion tabled by Mr. Acheson was that those countries whichhad shown special interest in the social, economic and cultural aspects of N.A.T.O.should form a committee to make proposals for developing this side of the alliance i.e., the implementation of Article 2 of the Treaty which in our present preoccu-pation with defence plans was in danger of being side-tracked indefinitely. the origin of this plan was the realisation that many of the smaller Powers, particularly the Dutch and Scandinavians, were growing increasingly restive at their lack of influence over the major decisions of the Council and at what they felt to beunjustified &quot; press-ganging &quot; by the big three (this has been particularly apparentin the discussions over Turkey and Greece). The Americans were anxious there-fore to mollify these countries to some extent by giving them a more prominent
XII.--Future Council Meetings64. In view of the elections in this country, it was agreed to defer the nextN.A.T.O. Council Meeting (in Rome) to the end of November.65. The North Atlantic Council also unanimously decided that moreministerial meetings were essential if work was to be carried on effectively and agreed that in future there should be meetings of the Council though not neces-sariiy in the full conclave of 36 ministers about three of four times a year.Conclusions66. Apart from the solid achievements recorded above, there are also more general conclusions to be drawn from the meetings which it may be useful to setdown as pointers to the future.67. First of all, from the point of view of Anglo-American relations, tnemeetings were successful in bringing our policies much closer togetner. Til isapplies particularly to the Middle East. It is clear that the Americans have now reached the conclusion that our two countries can no longer afford to pursueindependent policies in the Middle East and that if the whole area is to be savedfor the West, they must give us their full support in Egypt and elsewhere, Thereare still of course a number of other questions on which our policies have still to be brought into line, chief among them the looming problem of the finance ofdefence, which has not really been tackled yet as something which has to be solvedjointly. While some Americans pay lip-service to &quot; burden sharing,&quot; they are really still thinking in terms of Aid &quot; and even on that Congress has been extremely difficult.68. During all our discussions Mr. Acheson impressed us as the outstandingAmerican who is sensitive to the complex reactions of the European countries and above all understands and sympathises with our own particular approach to worldproblems. There was a heightened statesmanship and increased mellowness in mr. Acheson&apos;s handling of all these matters. The popular success of the japanese peace treaty and the enviable personal success which he had at San Franciscowere no doubt partly responsible for this. After San Francisco and the Presidentspublic eulogy he clearly felt himself in a strong position. Time and again he helpedus out, particularly in the very tricky negotiations with the French over the middle east Command. Attacks on Mr. Acheson, which have become a feature of american internal politics, will doubtless revive. But so long as Mr. Acheson is atthe State Department, and whatever trimming of his policies he may be forced to resort to in the face of public criticism, we can feel confident that American foreignpolicy will be conducted by a man who understands the British position andsympathises with the British approach to international affairs.69. Secondly, the meetings have also resulted in a great improvement in anglo-French relations. Our support in principle of the French plan for a european Army and our signature of the joint tripartite declaration on Germany,part to play in the affairs of N.A.T.O. The proposal received prompt support and developed into a full discussion of the wider aspects of the NAT. association, andan expression of our common desire to work for the long-term aim of the prosperity of the Atlantic Community as well as the short-term goal of military security63. In the course of this discussion, the Council drew up an important state-ment of faith stressing the peaceful objectives oi N.A.T.O., which was released for publication. This statement announced the formation of a ministerial com-mittee, composed of repiesentatives of Belgium, Canada, Italy, the netherlands and Norway, to &quot; consider the further strengthening of the North Atlantic-Community and especially the implementation of Article 2 of the North atlantic treaty.&quot; This committee will make recommendations to the Council forco-ordination and frequent consultation on foreign policy, particularly in regardto the promotion of peace; on cultural, economic and social co-operation withinN.A.T.O. or through other agencies; and on collaboration in the fields of cultureand of public information. It is understood, of course, that this body will notduplicate the work of any existing international organisations, and the foreign secretary uttered a warning against elaborate staffs and unnecessary expenditure.
together with the fact that we found ourselves taking much the same line on theeconomic problems of defence, seem to have had quite a disproportionate effect on french opinion and to have dissipated at last the cloud which our ambiguous attitudetowards European integration has recently cast over Anglo-French relations.70. Thirdly, the Ottawa meeting showed how sensitive the smaller AtlanticPowers, particularly Holland and Denmark and Norway, have become to leadershipby the three Great Powers unless exerted with more tact than the Americanshabitually display. If we are effectively to maintain the Atlantic Alliance we cannot afford to ignore this small Power complex and it is therefore important that weshould in future make full use of the Council Deputies as a shock absorber for theirgrousing and resentment at three-Power leadership.71. Fourthly, the value of having a meeting of the Finance and EconomicMinisters of the N.A.T.O. Powers was immediately apparent; it was largely due totheir presence that the Council gave practical recognition for the first time to theneed to take account of financial and economic posibilities and limitations. Fromthis point of view it may be said that the attendance of Finance and EconomicMinisters was overdue; however, that may be, such meetings should clearly continueto be held regularly in the future.72. Finally, we felt that separate meetings of Defence Ministers during thecourse of these Conferences are of great value in reviewing the progress that hasbeen made in the defence field, and that they should be a regular feature of Councilmeetings in the future.H.
