document  is the  property  of  his   britannic   majestvs   government primed for the Cabinet.   September, 1951CONFIDENTIALCopy No.   ^CP. (51) 25525th September, 1951CABINETMANPOWER FOR THE MINESMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power have, at various times in recent months, pressed on my colleagues the urgent necessity of importing large coal for the house coal market.2. After considerable discussion, it was agreed that we could buy Indian coal for gas works, thereby, perhaps, releasing some extra large coal for the housewife(this, unfortunately, is not certain as gas works stocks are still unsatisfactory) andthat we might buy Polish coal, if political difficulties with the Poles could be eliminated.3. I also proposed the purchase of a small quantity of dollar coal (perhaps a quarter of a million tons for delivery after Christmas).4. Some Indian coal has been purchased but it is low grade, and it is doubtfulwhether the gas works can take more than 250,000 tons at the most.If we could buy three-quarters of a million tons of Polish coal, and could getdelivery fairly soon, the prospects for the house coal market would be greatly improved. Unfortunately, we seem no nearer to reaching a solution of political difficulties with the Poles than we were eight weeks ago.5.  The proposal to import dollar coal has been rejected.6. This makes it essential for me to remind my colleagues that while house-holders with stocking space have bought a good deal more coal this summer, the merchants&apos; stocks are not yet a million tons as against the two and a half million which we meant to have at the end of October; and that, in all probability, theywill fall at least a million, if not a million and a quarter tons, below the safety figure.7. I have taken every practicable step to restore the situation by increasingthe manufacture of briquettes, diverting small coal from industry to the housecoal market to the maximum amount which the merchants can take, &amp;c.8. But apart from dollar coal, there is, in my view, only one hope of avertinga very serious crisis in the winter over household coal. That is to increase the manpower in the mines. By this I mean that the number of men in the mines should be increased by the end of the year by, if possible, 10,000. We achievedthis result last winter and I believe we should be able to do it again.9.   I regard the following measures to this end as essential:  (a) Stopping wastage from the pitsSir Hubert Houldsworth is already working on this with great energy and hopes for results. He is prepared to co-operate with the Ministry of labour in the highest possible degree.But it must be remembered that every industry has some wastage; that,wastage from the coal industry is, in fact, much below the average wastage ofother industries; that with trie present high wages obtainable for light workin rearmament industries, considerable wastage may be quite inevitable; andthat we must make this good by increased recruitment of people who are likelyto stay in the industry.
(b) Return of ex-miners from the ForcesOne class of recruits who will stay in the mines are ex-miners who havevolunteered on long-term engagements as regulars in the Armed Forces. Underthe scheme approved in February last 2,400 have, so far, been released, andthe number will, no doubt, rise to 3,000. This is the equivalent of 1 million tons of extra production per annum.I estimate that there may be about 3,000 more miners who would comeback to the mines if we now applied the scheme adopted in 1947. As thelong-term situation of coal is certainly more serious than it was then, I urge that this should be done. Details are set out in Annex A (in particular, inparagraphs 7 et seq.)(c) The Home Recruiting CampaignThe campaign decided on in July should be got into full swing and shouldbe conducted with great vigour. The Ministry of Labour lent great assistancein the early part of the year.   I believe the same success could be obtained now.(d) ItaliansThe Minister of Labour has put forward new proposals for the reorganisation -sation and acceleration of the recruitment of Italians. The Coal Board areprepared to co-operate in the fullest possible degree. I believe that the resistance of the rank and file of the National Union of Mineworkers (N.U.M.)can be overcome. We should aim at a great acceleration in the number ofarrivals.The prospects of success with N.U.M. Lodges will be much improved if the1947 scheme for release of ex-miners from the Forces and the home recruitingcampaign are both carried on with vigour.10. Even if all this action succeeds, it may, in my view, still be necessary to import some dollar coal after Christmas.   I state the case in Annex B.P. J. N.-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,25?/? September, 1951.ANNEX AManpower in the Mines1. Between February 1949 and November 1950 manpower in the mines fellfrom 728,000 to 686,000. During November, December 1950 and January 1951the Cabinet made a number of decisions which reversed this trend; betweenNovember 1950 and 30th April, 1951, manpower rose to 703,400. In May and june the figure at first remained stationery, and then fell slightly. In July and august it has fallen more sharply; and in the last 6 weeks it has fallen by 3,700 men.If this trend continues we should by the end of the year have no more miners than we had in November 1950.2. The immediate prospect for coal supply is, in my view, less alarming thanit was in 1947, except in regard to house coal, of which merchants&apos; stocks are lower than they have ever been before. But the longer-term prospect is clearly worse; thedifficulty of meeting the increasing demand over the next 2 or 3 years will be muchmore serious than the difficulty faced in 1947.3. In due course the output of coal will be adequately increased by themechanisation and reorganisation of the mines. But this process, while it can andwill be accelerated, must take time; in the interval, the increase of output can onlybe obtained by increasing the number of miners.
From the New Year we cannot expect a great gain over last year from extraSaturday working, as the miners began their increased effort in early January. TheCabinet must, therefore, be ready to take measures, however distasteful, which will bring more men to the mines.4. Undoubtedly the large-scale introduction of Italians is one of the besthopes. But there has so far been vigorous resistance to the acceptance of Italiansby the Lodges of the National Union of Mineworkers; and one of the argumentsmost freely used is that foreigners should not be introduced while there are trained men in the Armed Forces who want to come back to the pits. In two world warswe have brought home large numbers of men from the front line to dig coal. In1947 we took virtually every miner out of the Forces. In February of this year theCabinet accepted the principle that some of the men who had subsequentlyvolunteered on regular engagements should be released. The restricted scheme thenagreed to has brought in (to 22nd September) applications from 3,421 men, of whom2,438 have so far been released. The scheme was limited to those who first enlistedon a normal regular engagement after 31st December, 1948. Men of the rank ofsergeant or above, and men serving in the Japan or Korean war areas, were excluded.5. The necessary instructions went out at the. end of February and thenumbers of men released were approximately:  300 by the end of April.900 by the end of May.1,600 by the end of June.1,900 by the end of July.Under the original scheme, the last date for application for release was30th June, and the applications received for release naturally fell off in July, thereleases in that month representing applications made earlier. The scheme wasthen extended (CM. (51) 50) until 30th September, and since the notification ofthis extension was sent out in July, applications have been coming in in greaternumbers; in August there were a further 360 releases, and so far in September 178.6. It is not expected, however, that many more than about 3,000 men will be released, even under the extended scheme, which is due to terminate at the end ofSeptember, and thousands of ex-miners may remain in the forces either becausethe present scheme excluded them, or because they have not been sufficientlystrongly urged to return to the industry.7. I now propose that as in 1947 release should be offered to all other ranksstill serving in the forces, in all countries who have previously worked for six monthsat a coal mine, whether below ground or, if they are willing in future to work belowground, on the surface.8. I repeat that the manpower position in the pits is even graver than it wasin the early part of 1947, when, at the meeting of the Fuel Committee on 7th March,the Prime Minister said that it was clearly desirable that ex-miners in the forces should return to the mines if they wished to do so, irrespective of military commit-ments.9.   The proposed scheme would include the following categories:  (a) Regular soldiers, sailors and airmen(i) Serving their normal period of Colour Service;(ii) Serving on active service as Reservists.(b) National Service Men(i) Serving the normal two years&apos; period;(ii) Serving for an extended period.10.  The additional men brought within the release scheme would be:  (a) Sergeants and Warrant Officers everywhere.(b) Men serving in Korea and Japan.(c) Men with more than two years&apos; service in the Forces.(d) Men with surface experience only.
11. In order to ensure that the proposed scheme shall fulfil its purpose, everyex-miner should have the scheme explained to him, and each man should be pressed to take advantage of it. The importance of this was stressed in a letter from theMinistry of Fuel and Power to the Prime Ministers Private Secretary on12th March, 1947, as follows:-&quot; The tone of the offer is most important and I should like to suggest thatthe Prime Minister should ask that the offer be presented, not as anything inthe nature of a concession, but rather as an indication of the way in which themen concerned can best serve the national interest.&quot;In a minute dated 14th March, 1947, addressed to the Minister of Defence,the Prime Minister said:&quot; The response to these offers will no doubt depend to a large extent onthe tone in which they are made. It should be made clear to the men that inpresent circumstances it is definitely in the national interest that as many aspossible should return to the mines, and arrangements should be made toensure that all who respond are released immediately.&quot;Conclusion12. (a) I would urge that the existing scheme, widened in scope as I havesuggested in paragraph 7 above, should be extended after 30th September for afurther period of 6 months, and that instructions on the lines of the Prime Ministersminute quoted above should be issued to all concerned in the Services. I attachequal importance to both points in the Prime Ministers minute, viz.:  (i) the clear explanation to the men that it is in the national interest thatas many as possible should return to the mines;(ii) the immediate release of men who agree to return.(b) I repeat that this decision would greatly help to secure the acceptance bythe Miners&apos; Lodges of increased numbers of Italians.ANNEX BHouse Coal situation. The position as regards supplies of large coal is giving rise to most seriousanxiety and shows every sign of becoming critical. The essential minimum supportnow being given to the gas works and the railways has produced a most seriousdeficiency of house coal, stocks of which amount to 967,000 tons. At this level theyare over 600,000 tons less than a year ago and in fact lower than in any year sincethe war.2.   Since 1946 the position at the end of August has been as follows:  Tons, 000&apos;s1946      .................. 1,3941947      .................. 1,3531948      .................. 1,5521949      .................. 1,7351950      .................. 1,4181951      ...............      ;.. 898These figures, of course, reveal a most serious state of affairs bearing in mind that even with stocks up to twice as high as at present, we have had difficulty in getting through the winter without a breakdown, particularly last year.3. The merchants report that the situation is already so bad that they are willing to buy untreated smalls rather than go without coal, and have strongly pressed me to make substantial quantities available. I consider it essential to meet this request even though untreated smalls are in 10 per cent, deficiency. A transfer
of this kind to the house coal market is not practicable except at the expense of engineering and other industry, whose present stock position is fairly satisfactory,or of power stations, which I am most unwilling to touch, as the stock position isweaker and next winter&apos;s requirements are likely to be very heavy. I have given instructions, therefore, that as an emergency measure 150,000 tons of untreatedsmalls should be transferred from industry to the house coal market between now and end of October; I am informally consulting the F.B.I. and Industrial CoalConsumers&apos; Council on this proposal.4. This diversion is no more than a palliative. It is quite insufficient to make good the shortage of .ge coal but represents the most that it is possible to do withavailable British c&apos;\ plies. Even allowing for this addition the house coal deficitis likely to be over 1 million tons. Whether this relief can be continued during thewinter without harm to the power stations or industry is at present conjectural:the winter budget prospects so far as I am able to gauge them now, suggest thatthis is doubtful. The diversion of large coal from the gas programme would bepossible only if gas works stocks were to reach a level of five weeks, and their prospects of doing so appear at present to be poor.5. As regards imports, the outlook for Polish coal is precarious, and althoughthe Foreign Office are pressing the matter, it is impossible as yet to rely upon help from this source. The import of 250,000 tons of Indian coal already approved will help the gas works but we cannot yet assume that this will mean an equivalentrelief to our house coal difficulties. I fully appreciate the strong objections on balance of payments, freight and shipping grounds to any import of American coal and recognise the bad effect which such imports would have on our Europeanfriends. I consider, however, that an increase in freight rates (if that should takeplace) may well be a less serious disaster than a breakdown of house coal supplies.Nor should it be assumed that other imports, even for instance iron ore, would necessarily be more important to us next winter than coal imports.6. On present prospects the house coal situation after Christmas will be such that the import of 250,000 tons from the United States may be absolutely essentialto lessen the risk of a breakdown.
