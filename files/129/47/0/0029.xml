&quot;    HiIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY fS GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (51)254 COPY NO.25TH SEPTEMBER, 1951CABINETLOCOMOTIVE CONTRACT FOR PERSIAMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade at the Cabinet*s meeting on 4th September (CM. (51)58th Conclusions, Minute 3)  the Secretary for Overseas Tradewas asked to submit a report on the locomotive contract atpresent being executed by the Vulcan Foundry Co. for thePersian State Railways, with particular reference to thequestion whether any alternative markets could be found forthe locomotives if, in the event, they were not sentto Persia.2.      The report which follows has been agreed betv/een theBoard of Trade and the Ministry of Supply and follows informalconsultation with the Chairman of the Vulcan Foundry Co.3,      The Vulcan Foundry Co, is the second largest of elevenfirms manufacturing steam locomotives in the United Kingdom,Its production is of very considerable importance, particularlyin the export field,    (The value of locomotive exportsamounted to over  8 millions in 1950).4.      There are in fact two contracts with the PersianState Railways - one for 24 and one for 40 locomotivesjthe total value is approximately  2,130,000,    The orders were secured in the face of severe competition, and followeddirect intervention by the British Embassy in Teheran.The Persian State Railways have opened irrevocable creditsin respect of both contracts which have been covered bythe Export Credits Guarantee Department to the extent of90 per&quot;cent of any loss (including loss arising from a refusal by the United Kingdom to issue export licences)which the exporters might sustain.5,     Approximately 10 per cent of the work on the contractshas already been completed, 20 per cent of the materials forthe assembly, etc, of the locomotives has been received,and the remainder is on order and will be coming forward inthe course of the next two or three months.   First deliveriesare due to start in February, 1952, and the whole order isexpected to be coirvplete in December, 1952,6,     If work on the contract is stopped, there will be thefollowing consequences:-(a) There will be a very serious gap in production at the Company&apos;s works.    Owing to the time required to make production plans, producecomponents and order the necessary materials,it would be ten to twelve months before theCompany would be in a position to begin workon an appreciable scale on any other orders.The capacity freed by any stopping of thePersian Contracts could not be used in themeantime by the Company for other purposes andmost of the material fabricated for the contract would have to be scrapped.
(b) The Company arc most approhonsivo - and with good reason - that if there were such agap in their production programme theywould lose to other heavy industries as^^bstantial part of their labour forceof about 2,700 skilled workers.    Itwould be very difficult indeed tore build such a force.    It follows thatthere would be a real risk of a prolonged break in the continuity of the Company^ production capacity,which is regarded by the Ministry of supply as of vital national importance for exports in peace and for the continuedproduction of locomotives in vi^r.7.      The locomotives are designed to operate under conditions existing in Persia and would requiremodifications to make them suitable for other railwaysystems.    They are standard gauge, but the loading gaugewould render them unsuitable for operation on british railways.   Nearly all Colonial railways are non-standardgauge.    The Company are, however, very hopeful that ifthe contract with Persia were frustrated it would bepossible to sell the locomotives to Turkey or Yugoslavia,since they would bo suitable for the conditions in thosecountries (subject to certain modifications, such asconversion to coal burning)  while there would be the addedattraction that (subject to the time taken to carry out the modifications) very early delivery could be offered.    In thisconnection it is significant that the Government of yugoslavia is thought to be about to invite tenders for the delivery of sixty locomotives and, if this proves to bethe case, Vulcan&apos;s will themselves probably be submittinga tender.8.      In the light of the foregoing considerations andin view of the relatively favourable possibilities of alternative markets in Turkey or Yugoslavia, I have no hesitation in recommending - with the full concurrence ofthe Ministry of Supply - that the right course will, be toauthorise the Company to continue with the execution of the contract, notwithstanding the uncertainty of the situationin Persia.    If between now and the end of the year aPersian Government came into power with which satisfactoryrelations could be established, we should presumably be glad to be able to let them have the locomotives in accordancewith the contract terms; if there were not such a Government,then we should presumably have to consider finistrating the contract in which event,  as I have indicated,  there wouldbe good hope that the locomotives might be sold to Turkeyor Yugoslavia,9,     As our action in respect of other supplies has not unnaturally led to a certain amount of speculation amongthe workers at the Vulcan Foundry Co,  as to the futureof these contracts, it would be most desirable that adecision should be given as soon as possible and that theCompany should bo authorised to make it clear thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government had been consulted and had agreedthat work on these contracts should proceed.II, S,Board of Trade, S.W.I.25TH SEPTEMBER, 1951.
