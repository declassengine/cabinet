AGRICULTURAL WAGES AND prices memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries the National Farmers&apos; Union of England and Wales have announced in the Press and have given me advance notice oftheir intention to ask for a Special Price Review to meetthe extra costs which will he incurred if the proposalsof the English Agricultural Wages Board for an increasein the minimum rate of 8/- per week for men and 6/- perweek for women with an additional five days annual holidaywith pay are confirmed by the Board on 10th October.2,     They had previously (on 51st July) addressed formalrepresentations to me about the heavy and continued rises in other costs since the last Annual Review in Februarywhich they claim will amount to  20 millions in a full year, of which  9^- millions will be due to an excess of increased costs of fertilisers over the sum anticipatedand. allowed for at the last Annual Review.     In thatcommunication they suggested that a course which would avoid further increases in the prices of agricultural products would he for the Government to reconsider their decision on the removal of the subsidy on fertilisers(which was discontinued after 1st July last).5.     The Scottish Agricultural Wages Board is meeting today(24th September) to consider a claim for corresponding increases in the minimum agricultural wage and additionalholidays with pay.     If - as is probable - similar awardsare made in both Scotland and Northern Ireland theincreased costs in the United Kingdom will be, on an annualbasis, of the order of  20 millions.4.     In view of the terms of Section 2 of the agriculture act, 1947, and. the agreed procedure, it would be difficultto contend that the prospective increase in labour costs andthe unforeseen and substantial rise in prices of fertiliserswere not sufficiently &quot;sudden and substantial&quot; to justify a Special Review,       It would however be possible to rejectas inadmissible for the purpose of a Special Review theaggregation of a number of lesser items of cost increasessuch as transport charges, petrol (owing to the Budget)amounting to  lOf- millions.IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY * S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.

5.     The situation will obviously require very careful handling in view of the political position.     Continued uncer-tainty about the result of the union application fora Special Price Review may result in a lower standard of cultivation this autumn (particularly as regards the use of fertilisers) with a consequent falling off in crop productionin 1952.     If therefore we take no action or reject the Union&apos;application we shall be open to the charge of indifference tothe future food supply, and the situation eoLild clearlyhe exploited, particularly in the rural areas.6.     It might be possible and might indeed be desirable tonegotiate a compromise with the Farmers&apos; Unions underwhich in return for their waiving their claim for a special review with its consequent automatic effect on pricesof agricxiltural products, the Government would reintroducea subsidy on fertilisers which would take into account notonly the current increased costs of fertilisers over and abovethe sum allowed at the last Annual Review ( 9-4- millions ina full year) but also the increased costs of productionarising from higher wages if the provisional award is confirmed (about  20 million in a fall year).     An announce-ment of such a proposal during the next few weeks would,however, lay us open to the charge of offering a pre-election bribe to the farming community.7.     If the Agricultural Wages Board, confirms itsprovisional award on the 10th October it might he possibleto avoid serious trouble by an announcement that the Govern-ment is ready in principle to concede that a prima faciecase for a Special Review exists,,     Disctissions might thenbegin in the following week on the understanding that any decisions ?/ould have to he left to whatever Government isin office after the General Election.,8.      The advantage of this course would be that we shouldbe acting in accord with our existing undertakings to theagricultural industry while leaving any decision until theElection is over.     On the whole I would recommend mycolleagues to adopt this plan.T.W.Ministry of Agriculture andFisheries, S.W.1.24TH SEPTEMBER, 1951.
