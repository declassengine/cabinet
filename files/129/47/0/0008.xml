(51) 23324th July, 1951CABINETGERMAN CONTRIBUTION TO WESTERN defence memorandum by Foreign Secretary and Minister of DefenceBackgroundIn September 1950 the Cabinet accepted in principle a German contributionto Western defence (CM. (50) 59th Conclusions, Minute 1). This decision, whichwas reached with some reluctance, was a necessary pre-condition for obtainingUnited States agreement to the establishment of an integrated North Atlantic TreatyHeadquarters in Europe, the nomination of an American Supreme commander and the despatch of further American forces to Europe in peacetime. It was basedon the view, i shared by the United States and British Chiefs of Staff, that even with additional American troops, the allied forces likely to be available would still be inadequate for the defence of Europe; and that if Europe was to be saved from enemy occupation it must be defended in Germany and with German military assistance.2. The French Government were not at first prepared to agree to german rearmament on any terms, but eventually produced the &quot; Pleven Plan &quot; for a european Army in which Germany would participate. A compromise programmeof action was agreed upon by the North Atlantic Council at Brussels in December1950, when it was decided that (a) negotiations should be opened between the three occupying Powers, onbehalf of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and the Germans forthe raising, on certain conditions, of German units for incorporation inGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s integrated force;(b) the three occupying Powers should also discuss with the Germans &quot; any changes in the present occupation arrangements which might logicallyattend a German defence contribution &quot;; and(c) the French Government should invite other North Atlantic Treaty Euro-pean Governments to a conference in Paris to discuss the &quot; PlevenPlan.&quot;3. The Brussels decisions thus set on foot three parallel sets of negotiations,all of which have a direct bearing on a German contribution to Western defence.The first set (on the raising of German units for incorporation in General Eisen-hower&apos;s integrated force) has been taking place over the last six months at Bonn andhas now been concluded. A report by the three High Commissioners has beenagreed with the Germans and submitted to the three occupying Governments.40951bPrinted for the Cabinet.

2This report outlines German ideas on the form their contribution might take, andpoints out where these conflict with the conditions laid down at Brussels. Thesecond set of negotiations (on changes in the present occupation arrangements) isstill proceeding in Germany and is not likely to reach a conclusion for some monthsyet. But it is hoped by the end of July or the middle of August to submit a reportfor the consideration of Governments. The third set (on the &quot; Pleven Plan &quot; for a european Army) has been proceeding in Paris between France, Western Germany,Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg (with other North Atlantic Treaty OrganisationPowers, including the United Kingdom, United States and Canada as observers)and has also not yet reached a conclusion. An interim report to Governments is,however, expected to emerge shortly.4. The United States Government have now proposed in an aide memoire tothe Foreign Office and the Quai dTJrsay that the three occupying Powers should consult together on the Bonn report and, if possible, agree upon a common linebefore submitting it to the North Atlantic Council. They have suggested that thisconsultation should take place in the early days of August in Washington throughnational representatives on the Standing Group and that it should also include an examination of the preliminary report on the European Army. We have repliedagreeing generally with the United States proposals, but suggesting that politicalrepresentatives should be associated with the discussions.5. The object of this paper is to obtain ministerial approval for the guidance to be given to our representatives in the Washington discussions with regard to boththe general policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government on a German contribution to western defence and the detailed proposals contained in the Bonn report.The Choice before His Majesty&apos;s government. Of the three concurrent studies relating to German rearmament only theBonn discussion, as shown above, has been completed. The conference in Paris isonly just approaching the stage at which any clear idea can be obtained of whatthe European Army would look like, and on present form the discussions on theOccupation Statute have still several months to run. In these circumstances, it isnot yet possible to foresee precisely the form in which any German contribution would be raised, and there are certainly other elements in the problem on whichwe cannot yet express firm views. One of these is the financial implications for theUnited Kingdom of the creation of a German armed force on any substantial scale.The German Government is already questioning its ability to meet Allied occupa-tion costs from its own budget. It is only a matter of time before some part of thecost of maintaining Allied forces in Germany has to be borne by the OccupyingForces themselves. The creation of a German armed force, which will inevitablythrow a heavy burden on the German budget, especially in the initial stages, is bound to accelerate this process.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government, while accepting the principle of a german contribution, have always reserved their right to consider the timing and thenature of this contribution. This reservation is still valid, but it does not absolveus from the need to take decisions when circumstances demand it. The stakes inthe game far transcend the mere recruitment of a few German divisions. In thefirst, place, the whole future of Western Germany is involved, and on our handling of this matter may turn the question whether she can be retained in the Westerncamp or not. Any attempt permanently to &quot; sterilize&quot; Western Germany by keeping her disarmed and neutral would inevitably result in her being lost to theWest. There are already unpleasant signs in Germany that the position of inequalityand the absence of any positive national purpose cannot be maintained indefinitelywithout grave risk. Secondly, the defence of Europe demands a strategy basedon the Elbe and not on the Rhine, and the Western Powers clearly cannot defendWestern Germany without German co-operation and the assistance of Germanman-power. This leads to the inescapable conclusion, already accepted by theCabinet, that some form of German rearmament is necessary for Western defence.8. Other important factors are, first, the impatience of the Americans over theslowness of Western European rearmament as a whole and their belief that german participation has become an immediate necessity; second, the breakdown of theFour-Power Talks in Paris, which while they lasted had inhibited a forward policyin this matter; thirdly, the expectations aroused in the Germans by the conclusion
of the Bonn discussions and by the public statements of Mr. McCloy. Unless weare to come into open conflict with the Americans and to risk seriously rebuffingDr. Adenauer and the German Federal Government, we are compelled to move forward.9. In these circumstances our choice is limited to the question in what formthe German contribution should be raised. On this there appear to be three main considerations. First, the military necessity of obtaining an effective contributionat the earliest possible moment; second, the need to consider whether a decision torearm the Germans might not provoke a change of policy on the part of the soviet union and thus bring about a conflict which it is the whole object of our rearmament -ment effort to avoid; and thirdly, the need to ensure that any German rearmamentshall take place in conditions which are least calculated to make Germanydangerous to the security of Western Europe, either in her own right as underHitler or in association with Soviet Russia.10. Of these three considerations the first is primarily but not wholly military.The military authorities of the United States and the United Kingdom areunanimous in thinking that without the early raising of German man-power to reinforce the Allied forces on the continent there is no hope of holding a Sovietattack. The problem of equipping German forces is no longer believed to be so serious as was originally expected. The United States consider that they will bein a position to provide all the arms required for training purposes in the very nearfuture. While the Chiefs of Staff agree that it would be necessary to phase thetraining and build-up of German units with the arrival of equipment, they do notconsider that this in any way detracts from the need to start recruiting and trainingGerman land forces. The political aspects of this are that seven months have passed since the decision in principle was taken by the Atlantic Pov/ers, andnothing has happened. This delay already behind us argues powerfully against further delay.11. As regards the second point, it has always been the view of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment, and must surely remain so, that we must not be deterred by the fearof Soviet reactions from building up a position of strength in Western Europe.This policy has proved justified at each step which we have taken, from the firstconclusion of the Brussels Treaty to the appointment of General Eisenhower as supreme Commander and the reinforcement of United States troops in Europe.The proposed German contribution is part and parcel of the Western defence effort as a whole: and in order to minimise Russian apprehensions, we must make this abundantly clear. In other words we must ensure that the German effort doesnot take the form of a national army; that it is clearly tied in with the Westerneffort as a whole, and seen to be inextricable therefrom. So long as these conditionsare fulfilled, we do not believe that the raising of a German contribution, which hasnow been under active public discussion for nearly a year, would cause any suddenchange in Soviet policy.12. The third consideration leads to the same conclusion. The interests of western security too demand that German rearmament take place on conditionswhich tie Germany as closely as possible to the West and offer her a position and arole to play in the Western community which will satisfy her energies and ambition.13. These conditions are realisable now. Widespread German dislike ofrearmament has recently given way to increased anxiety regarding european defence. The present German Government is prepared, and even anxious, to raiseforces under conditions which would preclude their use for nationalist or revanchistepurposes and would not involve a revival of the old militarist class. Their maincondition is that Germany should acquire a broad equality of status with other powers and that the German forces should have complete equality with those ofother participating countries. At the same moment, the French Government, inthe European Army Conference, are actively advocating the same concept and are ready to place their own forces in a similar position. This combination of circum-stances is not likely to last indefinitely, and if the present occasion is lost we maynever again be able to direct German rearmament (which in the long run must inevitably take place in some form) into such controlled channels. Moreover,failure to respond to the new frame of mind in Germany would undoubtedly createdisillusion and encourage a return to neutralism.40951
14. Nor must we overlook the importance of American opinion. TheAmerican aide-memoire referred to in paragraph 4 above contains the sentence:&apos;* The United States Government perceives that an undue delay on this important practical matter (German rearmament) would cause serious doubt as to the seriousness of the purpose of the N.A.T.O. nations to proceed in themost expeditious manner for the creation of an adequate defence of western europe.&quot;This point of view is undoubtedly shared to some extent by General Eisenhowerwho is known to be concerned over the insufficient progress of European defence in general.15. Strong arguments of Biitish and European self-interest therefore supportthe view that German rearmament in the form and on the conditions which can beapplied to-day is infinitely preferable to what will become inevitable if we try tohalt progress. The impetus towards a European or Atlantic solution will be lost and the harsher alternatives of a German nationalist or an eastern-orientatedGerman army may well confront us.Washington Discussions16. For these reasons we consider that our objective at the washington disscusions should be to reach agreement on positive recommendations for the earlyrealisation of a German contribution to European defence.17. In order to reach such agreement it will be necessary to take account ofand to reconcile three main elements in the situation:  (i) the insistence of the French that the European Army solution should beconsidered in advance of, and given preference to, any direct contribu-tion of German forces to the N.A.T.O. Supreme Command;(ii) the determination of the Germans not to accept conditions which would place them in an inferior position to the other N.A.T.O. Powers; and(iii) the overriding need, from the point of view of Atlantic defence as a whole,to ensure that any scheme for a German defence contribution is mili-voluntarily effective and immediately practicable.We examined these three elements separately as follows:  (i) French Insistence on European Army18. Hitherto all N.A.T.O. negotiations on a German defence contributionhave been bedevilled by the conflict between French resistance to any form ofGerman rearmament and American insistence on the immediate need for a german contribution. This conflict has put a serious strain on the relations of the three major N.A.T.O. Powers, which it is important to avoid for the future. It wouldbe a mistake to underestimate French fears of the danger of German militaryrevival on one hand and of action liable to provoke Russia on the other: their plan for a European Army is designed to reduce both these dangers and we considerthat the only hope of securing their agreement to a German defence contributionlies in agreeing in principle that it should be made in the context of a european army. This means that in any arrangement resulting from these discussions theUnited States, United Kingdom and Germany will have to give the French anundertaking that any German contribution will eventually take the form of a contribution to the European Army. We do not, of course, suggest that the UnitedKingdom should itself join the European Army.19. Acceptance of the French thesis on this major point would also havethe.following advantages:  (a) it would present German rearmament to the world at large, and to theSoviet Union in particular, in the most favourable and least provo-cative light possible, i.e., as part of the movement towards european unity and not as a purely military measure;&apos; ib) it would be a further step towards integrating Germany in the West andmight prove a useful half-way house to eventual German membershipofN.A.T.O.;(c) it would make the French more willing to agree to a solution of the Germanpolitical problem which will enable Germany to associate herself with
Western defence. (It should be noted here that such a solution isimportant to us not only in relation to defence but as part of our general political objective, mentioned in (b) above, of bringing Germany intowilling and equal partnership with the Western nations.)(ii) German Desire for Equality20. The last word about German rearmament must, in the nature of things,be said by the Germans themselves: and in the opinion of the United kingdom high Commissioner no German Government will ever agree to say this last word,nor if they did, would they be able to pass the required legislation through theGerman Parliament, until Germany is accorded a status of equality, or approximateequality, with the Allies not only in the military, but also in the political field. Themain obstacle to a German contribution is, thus, at least as much political as military in character. On the purely military side the proposed European Armysolution should, in itself, go far towards satisfying the German demand for equality.It is an essential point in the French plan that all national contingents should receiveequal treatment within the European Army, and that all countries should be on an equal footing in its political and administrative control. The European DefenceCommissioner, who would be solely responsible, under the military guidance andcommand of SACEUR, for the formation and administration of the european army, would in turn be responsible to a Common Assembly and Council ofMinisters, on which all parties would be represented.21. In one important respect, however, the French plan, in its present form,places Germany in a position of military inequality in relation to the other N.A.T.O.countries. It provides that national units contributed to the European Army (andconsequently all German units) shall not be larger than Combat Groups, whereasother national contributions to General Eisenhower&apos;s forces would continue to beDivisions. The only militarily feasible way of eliminating this inequality is to raisethe size of the maximum national unit contributed to the European Army (and con-sequently of the German unit) to that of a Division. We therefore recommendthat, in return for our agreement in principle to support the idea of a european army, the French should be pressed to accept the Division rather than the CombatGroup as the unit for the European Army. This arrangement would also be more acceptable on purely military grounds, since the Chiefs of Staff have always held that the Division is the optimum unit.(iii) Requirements of Atlantic Defence22. Until we receive the promised interim report on the progress of theEuropean Army conference, it is impossible to say for sure how far the French plan,in other respects than the size of units, will be militarily effective as a contributionto the immediate needs of Atlantic defence. It is quite clear that we must obtainthe fullest information about the concept of the European Army as soon as possible.Countries which have actively participated in the European Army Conference havebeen France, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg and Western Germany. Canada,Denmark, Holland, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom and the United states have been represented as observers. According to the advance information thatwe have been able to obtain, the following proposals are likely to be included inthe interim report.(i) The European Army would be formed in successive stages. The aim of thefirst stage would be to produce a force of some 30 divisions backed by reserve and supply units and supported by the necessary air forces.This stage would, it is suggested, take 18 months from the time whenagreement to form a European Army had been reached.(ii) Political authority for the European Army would be exercised by a&quot; Defence Commissioner &quot; responsible to a Council of Ministers repre-senting the countries participating in the European Army.(iii) The European Army would form part of General Eisenhower&apos;s Commandunder an integrated headquarters responsible to him.23. It is clear that one of the principle military objections to the French plan is that in its present form it may delay a German defence contribution. We cannot accept such delay without detriment to Atlantic defence as a whole. It is, therefore,.
necessary to seek to modify the French proposals in such a way that they do notpostpone the first practical steps towards raising German units until the organisa-tion of the European Army has been completed. We must, in fact, persuade theFrench to agree that the two processes should be simultaneous. This would mean that while the Member Nations were working out the practical details of a european army, the Germans would be allowed to start recruiting and training military unitsof divisional strength for incorporation in that Army. We should also insist that if those units were ready trained and equipped before the organisation of the Euro-pean Army was complete they would be temporarily assigned to General Eisen-hower&apos;s integrated force pending the formation of the European Army. AlthoughGeneral Eisenhower&apos;s views on this question are not officially known, we believethey are roughly in line with our own.The Bonn Report, Size, Nature and Organisation of German Contingents24. Once it is agreed that the Germans should be allowed to begin raisingforces before the European Army plan is complete, it will be necessary to settle the size, nature and organisation of these forces. The only positive proposals yet putforward are those of the Germans themselves, as set out in the Bonn Report: thosemust, therefore, form the basis of the detailed military discussions in Washington.25. On the political side, the only two major points of difference between theBonn proposals and those agreed by the North Atlantic Council at Brussels are thatthe Germans -(a) refuse to accept certain controls (including Allied control over the DefenceAdministration) unless they are applied equally to the forces of other powers taking part in the defence of Europe; and(b) insist that the administration of defence requires a Defence Ministry insteadof the Administrative Office proposed in the Brussels decisions.26. As regards the first point it is clearly a vital Allied interest to safeguard against a revival of German militarism and a German General Staff, and, therefore,to retain some controls over the German military machine. The exact natureof these controls cannot be determined until we have a clearer idea than we have atpresent of how the European Army is going to work and of the outcome of thenegotiations concerning contractual arrangements. Generally speaking, it seems likely that the incorporation of German units in the European Army, the adminis-trative control of which will be vested equally in all participating Powers, will initself provide controls adequate for Allied needs and acceptable to German opinion.As regards a German Ministry of Defence, our view is that for practical reasons the Germans will need a special Department for the administration of their armed forces; but the Foreign Office feel that the creation at the present time of a GermanMinistry of Defence, with a German Minister of Defence at its head, would be [j^offensive to Allied opinion and unnecessarily provocative to the Russians. They Jhave, therefore, suggested that, at any rate for the time being, the German Depart- Iment responsible for the German armed forces should not be under a separate Minister but under one with other responsibilities,(e.g., the Chancellor) and should Ihave some less conspicuous title than Ministry of Defence. The Chiefs of Staff,on the other hand, consider that the only practicable solution of the problem isto create a German Ministry of Defence and that indeed the Germans for their partwill be content with nothing less.Procedure27. If, as we think necessary, the next meeting of the Atlantic Council is totake the question of a German defence contribution within sight of practicalrealisation it will be necessary to submit to it firm and practicable recommendations on the form of such a contribution. These recommendations must be acceptable to General Eisenhower, under whose command the German units will come. Wetherefore propose that as soon-as agreement is reached in Washington on the main points of principle, General Eisenhower or his representatives should be associatedwith the discussions. It might also be advisable, before any recommendations arefinally submitted to the N.A. Powers as a whole, to bring in the Germans.
28. It is recommended that the instructions to our representatives in washington should be on the following lines: - -(1) We consider that a German contribution to Western defence is militarilyand politically necessary, that the negotiations to that end should proceed as rapidly as possible and that the Washington discussions should result in tripartite agreement for its early practical realisation.(2) The most likely obstacle to agreement will be French reluctance to accepta German contribution except in the framework of a European Army.In order to carry the French with us, it is therefore necessary to be ableto assure them that any German forces raised will form part, eventually,of the European Army.(3) In order to make this concept at once militarily effective and acceptable to the Germans, we should insist on certain modifications in the presentFrench proposals; in particular we should press the French to agreethat the national unit in the European Army should be the division and not the Combat Group, and that, pending the completion of the detailed organisation of the European Army, the Germans should beallowed to begin raising and training units for eventual incorporation in it; meanwhile, they should be temporarily assigned to GeneralEisenhowers command.(4) To work out the details of a military solution on these lines for submission to the Atlantic Council, we should propose a subsequent meeting between the military representatives of the three Occupying powers with General Eisenhower and perhaps also with representatives of theGerman Federal Republic.(5) Meanwhile, we should press ahead with the current negotiations withGermany on the replacement of the existing Occupation Statute bycontractual arrangements, since a German defence contribution is dependent on their satisfactory outcome.H.
