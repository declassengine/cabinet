(51) 22725//2 July, 1951CABINETSITUATION IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN  HIGH COMMISSIONTERRITORIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the High Commissioner (Sir Evelyn Baring) has reported a conversation whichhe has had with an entirely trustworthy person who recently saw Dr. Malan inPretoria on the latter&apos;s return from holiday during the Parliamentary Recess. TheHigh Commissioner^ informant said that Dr. Malan at once referred to the positionof the High Commission Territories. Dr. Malan said that it looked as if the UnitedKingdom Government might give way in the Bechuanaland Protectorate (i.e., allowSeretse Khama to return) and that if this happened the consequences would bedeplorable. He would have to take very early action. He would have recourse to economic measures. He thought that, if he &quot; put on the screw hard &quot; to forcetransfer, he would have a united South Africa behind him.2. The High Commissioner asked his informant whether, in the latter&quot;opinion, the Union Government would actually blockade the Territories if Seretsewere recognised. The informant gave it as his opinion that they probably would.They might themselves suffer damage; but the Nationalist Government had alreadyshown itself ready on occasion to cut off its nose to spite its face. An example of impatient action against its own interests was the ban hastily imposed on the admission of &quot; foreign &quot; (i.e., non-Union) natives to Union pest-primary schools.3. The High Commissioner then asked his informani whether he thoughtUniori opinion on the recognition of Seretse was stronger or weaker than it hadbeen early in 1950. The reply was that he thought it much stronger, partly onaccount of developments in the Gold Coast but still more because recognition of seretse now would involve the reversal of a previous decision and would appearto be a surrender in face of a combination of political pressure in the UnitedKingdom and violence in the Protectorate, both engineered by Africans.4. The High Commissioner^ informant said in conclusion that the UnionGovernment were bound to press very hard next year for transfer of the Territories.Resistance would be difficult for us anyhow; it would become hopeless if Seretsewere recognised.5. As I have said, Sir Evelyn Baring&apos;s informant is entirely trustworthy. Iam satisfied that what he said reflects what is in Dr. Malan&apos;s mind. I think it important, therefore, that my colleagues should be aware of it; but we must, ofcourse, be extremely careful not to compromise our source by making any dis-closure of what we know from him.6. It is worth adding that Mr. Paver, who is head of the South African BentuPress, recently volunteered in conversation with a member of my staff views verymuch on the lines of those outlined above. Paver&apos;s assessments of South african opinion, European or African, are usually pretty accurate. He said that his impression was that recognition of Seretse now would probably be resented evenmore in the Union than a year ago. Against the background of the Gold Coastdevelopments the Nationalist Government would get a lot of support even fromEnglish-speaking South Africans for any action it took vis-a-vis the Protectorates.7. I have also heard that the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires in Pretoria isreporting to the same effect.P. C. G\W.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,25th July, 1951.40953
