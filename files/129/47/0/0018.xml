THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limitedIt   is   issued   for   the   personal   use   of nj(?vv*v&amp;*&apos;31TOP SECRET Copy No.    :CP. (51) 2433RD SEPTEMBER, 1951CABINETSUPPLIES OF FINISHED MILITARY equipment from THE UNITED STATESMemorandum by the Minister of defence as a result of an initiative by the Economic Steering Committee,and with the approval of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself, theUnited States Government was informed in March last of our intention,as soon as the  4,700 millions defence plan was worked out in furtherdetail, to transmit to the United States a statement showing how far productionunder that programme would go towards completing the equipment of theforces which the United Kingdom intended to raise and maintain, and indicating the extent and nature of the deficiencies of equipment which would remain when the programme had been completed.   The American Governmentwere informed that these deficiencies were expected to be very considerable -a tentative figure of between  1,430 millions and  1,800 millions was mentioned -and that His Majesty&apos;s Government would hope to discuss with them theextent to which these deficiencies could be met by the supply of finishedmilitary equipment under the Mutual Defence Assistance Act.2. The production programme within the  4,700 millionsrearmament plan was approved by the Defence Committee at its meetingon 31st July, 1951 (D. O. (51) 21st Meeting, Item 1).   It was made clear from thebeginning that this programme would by no means meet all the requirementsof the Services, and it has now been possible to assess the extent of the deficiencies in equipment which will remain when it has been completed.On the basis of this assessment, a further memorandum for presentation to the United States Government has been prepared.   In its preparation,certain issues of policy have emerged on which I think that it is desirableto have the views of the Cabinet.3. Broadly speaking, the deficiencies of the Royal Navy and theRoyal Air Force are of types of equipment which cannot be produced in theUnited Kingdom within the three-year period and which are required to fillgaps in the equipment of formations which will otherwise be fully ready tofight.4. The Army&apos;s problem is not so simple.   In general terms, the pro-duction programme for the Army under the  4,700 millions defence plan will provide new equipment for approximately 15 divisions.   Existing stocksof equipment will serve to outfit a further 7 divisions, with the very importantexception of &apos;B&apos; vehicles.   There will, however, be other serious gaps in the equipment of the 22 divisions whose needs will be met primarily from Britishproduction; these consist of types of equipment which are not produced in thiscountry and can only be obtained during the next three years from the United
5. By mid-1954 there will be 24 United Kingdom equivalentdivisions either already active or available for mobilisation in the early stages of a war if equipment is ready for them.   These consist of the Regular army of 10   /2)   divisions, the Royal Marine Commandos, which are equivalent toone division, and the first and second lines of the Territorial Army, which by that date under the operation of the National Service system will amount to12 I/3   divisions.   We canfrom our own resources, and subject to the filling of the gaps mentioned above by the United States, provide equipment for only 22.   Even if we assume that all the equipment which we produce isallocated to United Kingdom divisions, there will thus still be 2 divisionslacking equipment at that date.6. Such an assumption would, however, be unsound, as there arecertain forces of the Colonies, of Commonwealth countries, and of foreigncountries in Treaty relations with us, which we expect to come to the supportof the United Kingdom in a global war, which are essential for that purpose,and for which the United Kingdom will be expected to provide the great bulkof equipment.   These forces include the Commonwealth divisions which areexpected to operate in the Middle East, the Arab Legion, and the Iraq Army.Together they will amount to about 7 divisions;  the Colonial forces amountingto some 1V3 divisions.7. From the United Kingdom land forces, we have accepted as ourinterim contribution to the Medium Term Defence Flan of the North atlantic treaty Organisation (N.A.T.G.) a commitment to provide 9 divisions in theEuropean theatre by the end of the first three months of war.   The remainder of the forces in being at the beginning of a war or capable of immediatemobilisation will be required elsewhere, principally in the Middle East andthe Far East.   The forces which will be mobilised subsequently will be allocated to theatres in accordance with the higher strategic directionof the war.8. The total equipment requirement of these formations amounts to32 ^/z divisions, towards which, as I have mentioned in paragraph 6, theUnited Kingdom will be able to provide only 22 divisions worth, which will therefore contain serious gaps.   There are thus approximately 11 divisions for which no equipment will be available under present plans by mid-1954 andwhich, unless equipment can be found for them from other sources, will not beready to fight until equipment can be supplied for them from United kingdom production after the outbreak of war.9. The total cost at United Kingdom prices of providing equipment forthese 11 divisions, and to fill the gaps in the equipment of the land formationsfor which the United Kingdom will be primarily responsible, and of theUnited Kingdom naval and air forces, is estimated to be approximately 1,500 millions.10. The memorandum which officials have prepared for presentation to the United States Government explains this situation, and proposes thatways and means of meeting the deficiencies disclosed should be discussed between the two Governments.   It suggests that the Americans should indicate to what extent they would expect to be able to assist by providingfinished military equipment under their Mutual Defence Assistance Programme(end item aid).   It also points out that the United Kingdom must look at defenceglobally, and that the present criterion for grant of end item aid, whichlimits it to forces earmarked as contributions to N.A.T.O. or for the defenceof the United Kingdom base, is artificial and should no longer apply.   If the americans are unable to interpret their legislation so as to widen the criteriain this way, they are asked to accept the thesis that the primary commitment of the United Kingdom must be the equipment of those forces which are
ineligible for end item aid and that the resultant deficiencies would thus fallwholly or largely upon the forces committed to N.A.T.O.11. The proposed approach to the Americans has been based on theassumption that all we intend to ask for is end item aid to meet the deficiencies which will remain when our own  4,700 millions plan hasbeen completed.   Hitherto, there has been no suggestion that we should askfor aid in relief of our own defence production programme under the  4,700millions rearmament plan.   I understand, however, that the Chancellor of theExchequer is of the opinion that, in view of the recent serious deterioration in our general economic position and particularly in the balance of payments,we should now consider whether we should not make some reference to thepossibility, to put it no higher, that we may find ourselves compelled toreduce our own programme and to seek a greater amount of end item aidin consequence.12. I am myself extremely doubtful whether it would be wise even tohint to the Americans at this stage that we may be contemplating aretreat from our declared intention to carry out our full rearmamentplan as our appropriate contribution to the defence of N.A.T.O. and the wholefree world.   I fear that any suggestion of this kind would destroy the valueof the approach and make it virtually certain that we should receive an unfavourable repl/.13. I would myself go further and express doubts of the wisdom of approaching the Americans at all with what amounts to a request for aid on an enormous scale.   I do not believe that it is likely to produce any verysignificant result, as there seems little chance that the Americans will beprepared to ask Congress during the next three years for very largely increased appropriations for end item aid, and, since their principalconcern is with the defence of Western Europe, it is very probable thatthey will prefer to supply aid to the European countries such as Francewhich can provide man-power in great strength but have hitherto made littleeffort to equip it from their own resources.14. I have therefore been wondering whether it would not be a wiser andmore fruitful line of approach to ask the Americans to ensure that the UnitedKingdom receives the raw materials and the machine tools which it requiresin order to carry out its announced defence programme and at the same timeto maintain its exports and to increase its productivity sufficiently to maintain its standard of life during the rearmament period and to increase it graduallyafter the peak of that period had been passed.   We might then at some later stage represent to the Americans the deficiencies with which we shall stillbe left after oxir programme has been completed, the impossibility ofmaintaining the production of armaments after the end of the three year period at a level sufficient to meet these deficiencies in a reasonable time, and theneed for substantial end item equipment as a means of enabling this countryto devote some of its resources at an early date to measures of social better-ment and ecommie expansion.15. In brief, the points on which I think the Cabinet should express an opinion are:-(a) Should we now approach the United States with a statement of the deficiencies in the equipment of our forces which will still remain when our own three year defence production programme has been completed?

Should we couple the statement with a request for assistance in meeting these deficiencies by greater amounts of end itemaid than we have hitherto received?If so, should the underlying assumption be that we intend to complete our own defence production programme duringthe three years or should we suggest that we may for economic reasons be forced to reduce it and so become stillmore dependent upon American end item aid?Should we a.1 this stage confine our approach to the americans to a request for adequate supplies of raw materials and machine tools in sufficient quantity to enable us to carryout our own defence production programme on time in orderto  ensure an increase in general productivity, deferring anyrequest for greater quantities of end item aid until some later date   except in respect of some items which are regardedas vital to the completion of our defence programme?.minister/ of Defence, S.
