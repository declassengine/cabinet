HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC-MA JEST-Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(51) 23430TH JULY, 1951CABINETJAPANESE PEACE TREATY:JAPANESE SHIPBUILDING CAPACITYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 7th June (CM.(51) 41st Conclusions, Minute 1(6)) the cabinet agreed to defer a decision about the manner in which Japanese shipbuildingwould be controlled until information was received about the further investigation of this subject in Tokyo.COPY NO.   2l2. It will be remembered that Mr. John Allison, Mr. John FosterDulles&apos; Assistant on the Japanese Peace Treaty, went to Tokyo immediatelyafter Mr. Dulles&apos; visit to London in June in order to discuss with theJapanese voluntary arrangements for a reduction of Japanese shipbuilding capacity.3. On 3rd July, Mr. Allison sent to the United Kingdom political representative in Japan a memorandum prepared by the Japanese whichcontends that present shipbuilding capacity in Japan is not excessive.4. The memorandum states that the present capacity of Japaneseshipyards is not 310,100 gross tons a year but 676,700 tons (the differencebetween these two figures representing disused yards which are no longerserviceable).    The actual operation rate is said to be 70 to 80 per cent.Output is therefore said to be 400,000 to 500,000 tons a year.    Thememorandum argues that, according to present plans, Japan will possess1,549,000 tons of ocean-going ships by the end of 1952.    Because of the longer hauls involved in Japan being obliged to trade with the United Statesand other areas instead of with China and the Far East, Japan will need2,236,000 tons of ocean-going ships in 1953.    Another 700,000 tons will thus have to be acquired by 1953, largely from new construction.    Theestimate of Japan&apos;s shipping requirements in 1956 is based upon an estimated overseas trade in that year of 32 million tons (compared with20 million tons in 1951).    On this basis, the memorandum claims, japan would need 2,956,000 tons of ocean-gcing ships and 820,000 tons of coastalships in 1956.    This estimate is based upon the assumption that Japancarries 50 per cent of her foreign trade.    It follows from these estimates,the memorandum concludes, that the present capacity of Japanese shipyardswill be fully occupied at least until 1956, in supplying the essential require-ments of Japan.5. It is difficult to estimate the real requirements of Japan for shipping in the next five years.    It is even difficult to say whether676,000 tons a year is in fact the present capacity of Japanese shipyards.It is probable that the estimate of 32 million tons for Japan&apos;s foreign tradein 1956 is inflated.    Nor do we accept the assumption that Japan should1-
carry 50 per cent of her foreign trade.    In addition the Japanese memoran-dum takes no account of ships bought by Japan from other couitries (thepurchase of 250,000 tons has already been authorised by the supreme commander).    It is probable therefore that during the next five yearsJapanese capacity will in fact be excessive.    Even if the Japaneseestimates for the next five years are accepted as reasonable, it isprobable that Japanese shipbuilding capacity would in any case be excessive in the period after 1956 because replacement demands wouldnot keep a capacity of 676,000 tons fully occupied.    There is thereforedanger that after 1956 the Japanese fleet would continue to expand or elseJapanese competition for shipbuilding orders would be intensified.    Havingregard to all the evidence, it seems probable that there is no economicground for agreeing that Japan&apos;s capacity need exceed say a figure ofabout 400,000 tons per annum.6. Nevertheless, the Cabinet have decided that no restrictions should be placed upon Japan for security reasons.    The only grounds onwhich we can continue to urge the Americans to bring about some reduc-tion in Japanese shipbuilding capacity is by showing that the presentcapacity is uneconomic in Japan&apos;s own interest.    It is clear, however,that the Americans do not at present agree with our interpretation on thispoint, and as they do not agree we cannot expect that they will consent tothe insertion in the present liberal and non-restrictive draft treaty ofa restriction upon the Japanese economy designed mainly to reduce hercompetitive position compared with the United Kingdom.    Moreover,while the Australian and New Zealand Governments share our anxieties onthis score (see paragraph 8 below), India, Paldstan and Ceylon take the opposite view:  they are strongly opposed both to the general idea of a restrictive Treaty and to any reduction of Japarfs shipbuilding capacity inparticular.    To make an issue of this point would thus be to produce an open division between the Asiatic and non-Asiatic, members of the Common-wealth, with the Asiatic members aligned on the side of the United States infavour of those liberal principles by which we too claim to have beenguided in our general policy over the Treaty.7. While therefore it is impracticable to suggest, at this stage, thatthe draft Treaty should include a provision restricting Japan&apos;s ship-building capacity, I suggest that we should inform the United States Govern-ment that we still consider this capacity to be excessive and that we must therefore continue to press for it to be reduced by action outside the Treaty.8. The Australian and New Zealand Governments are very much con-cerned on security grounds to obtain some reduction in Japanese ship-building capacity.    We should therefore give the Australian and NewZealand Governments an opportunity of making a simultaneous approachwith us to the United States Government on the lines proposed above.RE C OMME agenda T ION9. That we should inform the Australian and New Zealand Governmentsof the substance of the memorandum communicated by Mr. Allison and state that we propose to inform the United States Government of the reasonsfor which we still consider Japan&apos;s shipbuilding capacity to be excessive, sothat we must continue to press for it to be reduced by action outside theTreaty;  we should also enquire if the Australian and New Zealand Govern-ments would be prepared to make simultaneous approaches with us to theUnited States Government on these lines.H.M.Foreign Office, S.W.1,30TH JULY, 1951. -2-
