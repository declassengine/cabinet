.C -  MENT IS THE FRCPERT , OF HIS BRITANNIC iv2Ai&quot;ESTY&apos;2 GC  ERNMENTSECRETP. (51) 2 .2SOP&apos;. NO.3RD SEPTEMBER, 1951CABINETTHE BALANCE OF PA J5MSNTS position memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExcliequerAt the beginning of July C. (51, 14th Meeting), we consideredthe report on the 1951&quot;52 balance of payments (E.P. ...(51; S3;.   This esti-mated a dollar deficit for 1951-52 of $2500 millions, and a United Kingdomoverall oalance of payments deficit, including stockpiling, of  375 millions.2. At a later meeting vE; P. 0.(51) 17th Meeting), the    ommitteeconsidered a further report on import cuts ;E.^- . ..^51) .9,, which pointed outthat the position had worsened,   I v/arned my colleagues that we were expectinga dollar deficit in the third quarter alone of almost  330 millions, andthat this meant that by the end of the year gold and dollar reserves mightbe reduced to  about $23,053 --nillions, and that by the spring one-third of thegains made since devaluation would have been lost.3. The course of events since then has confirmed these fears.The course of the dollar surplus and deficit this year has been:-&quot;Sterling area dollarsurplus or deficit$ millionJanuary - March (average)	4-	120x*pril	+	59May	+	1June	-	6July		137August	-	211-i. There have been many non-recurrent expenditures in the lasttwo months, and I should expect the rate of deficit to fall in the next few months,But all the evidence suggests that there will be a continuing deficit, at a rate which will rapidly make serious inroads into our reserves, swallow up thegains which we have made since devaluation, and leave us in a critical position.5. The new factors in the situation since June are:-i,   Persian oil.       I have already had to authorise the spending ofS150 millions to replace Persian oil, and this will last onlyto the end of the year.   If there is no settlement, the cost of replacing the oil would be about JZ\. 55 millions in 1352, against this we   would save perhaps $75 millions by withdrawing the
special arrangements we have with Persia which enable her to convert sterling into dollars for certain purposes.(ii)  European Payments Union(E. I- . P. ,-.    In July and August, we have seen in large deficit in E.P.     , and the estimate for the quarter is 130 millions.   This is always a bad quarter, because ofexpenditure by tourists and on fruit and vegetables.   But ourdeficit has been much larger than anything that could be accounted for by seasonal influences;  there has been a rapid increase in our own and the other sterling area countries&apos;imports from Europe, and this is the dominant factor.   Theresult is that we have had to repay all the dollars we earned fromE.P . CJ. last /ear;  the   will have repaid the credits we havegiven thern, and from the end of this month onwards we shall bedrawing credit from S. P . J. , and if our deficits persist, pa/ingdollars at a later stage.    In 151-52, we shall probably lose 150 milJions.(iii)    other sterling -Commonwealth..    The continued fall in wool prices,and the falls this year in rubber and tin prices, are reducing the sterling area&apos;s dollar earnings, while the dollar (and other)expenditure of the other sterling area countries is rising veryfast, for the same reasons as ours is.   The worsening comparedwith our June estimate maybe  25:3 inillions a year.0. In June, the dollar deficit for 1 51-52 was put at around^5oO million.   These three new factors above would raise it to something approaching  1,20 .: millions.   In view of what has happened in the past,there is no need for me to stress the importance of this change in relationto reserves which at the end of June were no more than  3,870 millions,,V/e had hoped that the United Kingdom deficit with the dollar area (over  1,000 millions, excluding Persian oil replacement) would be considerably offset by the other sterling area countries dollar earnings, andthat we should not lose dollars heavily elsewhere.   But these new factorsfrustrate this hope;   indeed, the rise in the cost of our imports from all sources is threatening loss of supplies or payments of gold or dollarsall round the world,  with Finland, for example, a vital source of timber, pulpand paper, we have a 1951-52 prospective deficit of  50 millions.   What we are involved in is a deterioration of the position of the whole sterling areavis-a-vis virtually the whole of the rest of the world.8. In the background, I would refer to the problem of Germany.If it became necessary for us to pay the local costs of our Forces, insteadof the Germans paying them as occupation costs, this would be an additional burden of up to  180 million a /car on our S. P. U. deficit and on our overallbalance of payments.   This is an additional load which we cannot possiblybear.9. During the last fifteen months, the world economic situation hasbeen changing with bewildering rapidity, and inevitably our fortunes riseand fall accordingly.   That is why my predecessors and I have continuallystressed the importance of having large reserves.   Thus the sterling areafaces   a dollar deficit in 1951-52 of $1,2 iO millions compared with a surplus in1950-51 of $1,000 millions;   and the United Kingdom position on overallaccount deteriorates from a surplus of  2 30 millions in 1-/50 to a deficit of . -k-OO millions in IS51/52.   These facts illustrate how we can never afford to take our eye off the oalance of payments and regard our situation as stable.
10. We have had two objectives in our external financial polic, -first, to remain independent of gereral economic assistance from the UnitedStates;   second, to maintain overall balance, excluding stockpiling, in our external accounts.   The second objective is already/ frustrated for this year.If we allow the reserves to run out without taking the necessary measures,external and internal,  to right the situation, we shall be unable to maintainthe first objective cither.11. After my return from North America I will make further positiveproposals to my colleagues.   In the meantime I ask that everyone shouldtake into account the seriousness of the situation in any policy decision whichmay be made in the next few weeks.12. I propose to inform ivir. onyder and other members of the JnitedCtates Administration of the worsening of our situation.   This will be the background to a series of talks on specific economic issues where action by them could assist us and to the more general discussions at Ottawa onsharing the burden of rearmament.13. I also propose to inform the other Commonwealth finance ministers of the situation in the course of my visit to V/ashingtcn, and toask them to consider measures to deal with the situation so that we can take effective combined action at the meeting of Commonwealth Financeiv.&apos;ministers which I hope will be arranged at the beginning of January.H.
