confidential cp.(51) 228 COPY NO.f Z5TH JULY, 1951CABINETLEASEHOLD reform memorandum by the Lord chancellor on the Prime Minister&apos;s directions, I arranged for a preliminarydiscvission, by the Ministers most closely concerned, of the Attorney-Generals memorandum on Leasehold Reform (C.P.(51) 205).Security of Tenure2. The Attorney-General&apos;s memorandum refers to various proposalsfor giving a statutory security of tenure to residential tenants who are notat present covered by the Rent Acts.    These proposals are as follows:-Houses of &apos;Rent Act&quot; Size(a) An occupying ground lessee of a house, however small, is not nowprotected on expiry of his ground lease if (as is usually the case) theground rent is less than two-thirds of the rateable value.    This shouldbe reversed so as to give ground lessees the same protection under the rent Acts as rack-rent tenants.(b) Sub-tenants who hold from ground lessees and are at presentprotected by the Rent Acts should continue to be so protected (as againstthe head landlord) after the expiry of the intermediate ground lease.(This would restore the law to what it was thought to be before a recent decision of the Court of Appeal.)Bigger Houses(c) There should be a prima facie right to a renewal of tenancy forall occupying tenants of unfurnished residential property too big to attract the Rent Acts code, whether they are ground lessees or hold on ordinaryoccupational tenancies of whatever length.     The right would have to besubject to a fairly wide list of &quot;just exceptions&quot;.    The rent would be a fairmarket rent, fixed, in default of agreement, by a Tribunal, and the period and other terms of the lease would also be subject to the Tribunal.    Thereare many details which would have to be further worked out.3. These proposals, if implemented, would represent a very con-siderable social reform, and we felt they ought to be approved in principle.Leasehold Enfranchisement4. The question then arises whether we should confine ourselves toprotecting and prolonging the tenanfs right of occupation, or whether weshould go further and give him also the right to acquire compulsorily theproprietorship of his house, which he can then use either for occupationor, if he prefers, for purposes of resale or of letting at a rack rent.[-HIS DOCUMENT- IS T-HE PROPERTY OF HIS-BRITANNIC MA.JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
5. There was general agreement at our meeting (a) that, if there isto be a scheme of leasehold enfranchisement, it must be limited to occu-pying ground lessees of residential property and should not be extended torack-rent tenants under ordinary occupational tenancies (normally for 3,5, 7 or 14 years);   (b) that the only practicable scheme for fixing the price which the tenant should pay on exercising his right to enfranchise hislease was one which assumed the enactment of the proposals, outlined above, which give the tenant security of tenure on the natural expiry of the lease.    The market value of a reversion appreciates very steeply towardsthe end of the term, because of the prospect of reversion to vacantpossession.    If we gave the tenant the right to enfranchise on payment ofthe market value of the reversion, the right would be too costly to be of any use to him.    But the effect of the above proposals would be to diminishvery considerably the market value of the reversion, because the reversionwould be subject to the presence of a sitting tenant at a controlled rent.6. On the general merits of enfranchisement, some of us were inclined to think that, if security of tenure were granted, little case wouldbe left on social grounds for adding a right of leasehold enfranchisement,with its inevitable complications.    On the other hand, some of us feltthat there would be grave disappointment on political grounds if ourpermanent legislation on leasehold reform did not include some right,however restricted, to leasehold enfranchisement.7. On the whole, we felt that the Cabinet might find it expedient,without committing themselves now to the principle of leasehold enfranchisement-enfranchisement, to direct that a scheme should be worked out on a provisionalbasis in order that Ministers might judge, in the light of difficultiesthrown up in detailed consideration, whether such a measure would be worth while.3. If leasehold enfranchisement is introduced, it may well benecessary to exclude from its scope leasehold property held by local andpublic authorities as ground landlord, whether it is held for development(as in the case of New Town Corporations and local planning authorities)or for investment (as in the case of the Crown Lands Commissioners andthe Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster).9. There is also the question whether tenants who purchase a groundlease during the last, say, 10 or 15 years of its term should be excludedfrom the scheme, on the ground that their stake in the property is not reallygreater than that of an occupational tenant under a short lease and that security of tenure at the end of the lease is sufficient for them;  and whetherlandlords who brought the superior interest towards the end of the term witha view to occupation or re-development on the expiry of the lease, and whopaid a large sum for the reversion, ought likewise to be excluded.    these suggestions lead to considerable difficulties, which are discussed at length in paragraphs 17-25 of the Annex to C.P.(51) 205 and summarised inparagraph 26 of the Annex.Summary10. The questions for decision are summarised in paragraph 48 of the annex to C.P.(51) 205.    Our general feeling was that questions 1 and 2 (all parts) should be answered in the affirmative.    As to the questions relatingto leasehold enfranchisement, we thought that, without prejudicng the generalissue whether leasehold enfranchisement was or was not desirable, we might
lflask for a scheme to be further worked out on the assumption that therewould be affirmative answers to questions 3, 4 and 5.    Our discussionshowed some differences of view about the details in question 5:probably, however, a preliminary draft Bill could be prepared on thebasis of alternatives, which would assist Ministers in reaching a firmdecision.House of Lords, S.W.1,25TH JULY, 1951.
