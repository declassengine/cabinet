US   document   is  the   property  of   his  britannic   majestvs  governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.3 1CP. (51) 25022nd September, 1951CABINETBAMANGWATO AFFAIRS: TSHEKEDI KHAMAMemorandum by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations the three observers sent to Bechuanaiand (CM. (51) 51st Conclusions,Minute 3) have now reported, and Mr. Gordon Walker regrets that he must troublehis colleagues again with the question of the Khamas and the Bamangwato Reserve.As usual, there are some very awkward aspects of the question to decide, thoughthe main issue is simple enough. The main question for decision, as mr. Gordon Walker sees it, is in Section B of this memorandum. In Section A,I give the main developments since this matter was last considered by the Cabinet.A. Recent Developments2. Despite one unseemly quarrel in public the observers have sent in clear,and on the whole, useful reports (Annexes B and C).3. Mr. Bullock and Professor Macinillan have put in a joint report. Theyexplain very clearly why it is impossible for Tshekedi to return as a private citizen(Annex B, paragraph 33). It is not so much, they say, a question of Tshekedi&apos;sambition or honesty as of his status as the senior man in the tribe whilst Seretseis away. So strong is the sense of hereditary hierarchy that he would in fact beleader of the tribe. Mr. Bullock and Professor Macmillan say that memories ofTshekedfs high-handed acts are still vivid. The great majority of the tribe do not want Tshekedi back because he would rule over them and they fear the reactions of his authority.4. It was largely for this reason that the present tribal leaders refused to agreeto a joint kgotla. They said that Tshekedi had voluntarily withdrawn himself andjoined another tribe. Were he now to be admitted to a kgotla this would automatically mark his reincorporation into the tribe and from that moment hishereditary authority, of which he cannot divest himself, would come into force.5. On 11th August the observers reported to the Secretary of State theirfailure to get a joint kgotla and unanimously recommended that he should abandonthis idea and let them assess the views of the tribe about Tshekedrs return by meansof local kgotlas in every part of the tribal territory. On the 13th the Secretaryof State accepted this recommendation and agreed that endeavours to hold a jointkgotla must be abandoned.6. The one issue before the observers was to report on the attitude of the tribe towards the question of Tshekedi&apos;s return to the Reserve in a private capacity.On this issue they give a clear answer:  (a) Mr. Bullock and Professor Macmillan say &quot; On this one question we have no hesitation in declaring that thereturn of Tshekedi Khama in any capacity whatsoever at the present timeand in the present circumstances would be contrary to the wishes of themajority of the tribe and bitterly resented by a substantial number. Onthis issue emotions now run dangerously high through the tribe.&quot;(Annex B, paragraph 31.)(b) Mr. Lipson, in a separate report, is less unqualified but comes to essentially the same conclusion (Annex C, paragraphs 20 and 21). In effect he says41245 b
that the feeling against Tshekedi is not as tense as it appears because therewas intimidation by his opponents, who are now in control of the tribe.Had Tshekedi attended a joint kgotla he might have influenced manyto change over to his side. Mr. Lipson puts it as follows: &quot;My own view is that, in spite of all that Tshekedi could have done, there would still have been a substantial majority against his return, so long asSeretse remained in exile. The chief fear of very many of those whowere opposed to Tshekedi&apos;s return would probably be removed hadSeretse also been allowed to return. They would, for the most part,acquiesce in his return, if Seretse were back in the tribe as chief and agreed that Tshekedi might rejoin the Bamangwato. Meanwhile,conditions in the tribe are deteriorating owing to lack of strongleadership.&quot;It will be seen that in the first few lines of this passage Mr. Lipsoms views onthe question put to the observers are clear; but he has felt it necessary to introduce the question of Seretse&apos;s return, which was outside his terms of reference.7. In private conversation Mr. Lipson told the Secretary of State that hethought we ought to take the risk (which he agreed was very considerable) of lettingSeretse and Tshekedi Khama back. It is quite possible that he may say something like this in public. Mr. Buliock and Professor Macmillan were, on the other hand,quite clear that it would be a mistake to allow either of them back. On the issueon which they were asked to report the observers have given a clear verdict whichjustifies the Government in continuing to maintain the exclusion of Tshekedi fromthe Reserve.B. The Issue8. The Secretary of State is under an obligation, given in Parliament, to publish the observers&apos; reports. They must be accompanied by some statement orreaffirmation of Government policy the situation in the Reserve in itselfdemands this. Mr. Gordon Walker therefore wishes to remind his colleagues ofthe considerations which had to be taken into account when the previous decision was taken and which in his opinion are still as strong.9. The Secretary of State considers that, if the internal situation in the Reservecould be looked at in isolation, it would be a fair point that we could make the tribe happy if we let both Seretse and Tshekedi Khama back. They might falloutin due course and the fact that Seretse had a white wife and half-caste children would be used against him in any dissensions that might arise and would weakenhis authority. In the end tensions and divisions might well become grave. However,in the short run the tribe would doubtless be happy.10. There is also the consideration of public opinion here. Certainly the issuehas become one of which the public is aware, but there is no evidence that there is any widespread public concern. For instance, since Tshekedi started his campaign in June Mr. Gordon Walker has received, either direct or through IvLPs., letters from only forty persons about this issue a good many of these came from one ortwo places where Tshekedi spoke and someone obviously organised a letter-writingcampaign.11. Despite the apparent absence of widespread public concern at present, ithas, however, now become such a celebrated cause that it could build up again intoa big issue at any time. Tshekedi Khama has announced his intention of returning to England to pursue his campaign against the exclusion order against him. Hesaid recently at the conclusion of the observers&apos; visit &quot; This is not the end. Itis only the beginning.&quot; But he will probably postpone his visit to this country inview of the general election. This is also likely to crowd out or postpone any realvolume of criticism. In any case Mr. Gordon Walker doubts whether the conservatives will again try to make capital out of the Tshekedi question. Theyare divided and many of them have, Mr. Gordon Walker thinks, been impressed by the warnings given by Mr. Strauss, the leader of the Opposition in the UnionParliament on his recent visit to England, and by Sir Evelyn Baring. They willprobably also be deterred by the realisation that it is hard to separate the issues of tshekedi Khama and Seretse Khama.12. The Secretary of State has carefully considered whether it would bepossible to let Tshekedi go back while maintaining the exclusion of Seretse. Theyhave both been excluded, but a distinction can be drawn between their cases.
Seretse was excluded on account of a specific act of his own which could be regardedas unfitting him for the chieftainship. Tshekedi, on the other hand, was not excluded on account of any blameworthy action of his own but because, if Seretsewas to be excluded, fairness and perhaps the maintenance of order required thatTshekedi should not remain in the Reserve. If we let Tshekedi back now, therewould certainly be disorders at first in the Reserve, but Tshekedi might thereaftersucceed in asserting his authority. On the other hand, the disorders in the Reservemight be serious. Tshekedi himself has said to Protectorate chiefs that, if he is allowed to return to the Reserve, he would work for Seretse&apos;s return. In order tomaintain his position in the Reserve, he would probably have to press the Govern-ment for Seretse&apos;s return, even though he might otherwise be reluctant to do so.In these circumstances the pressure of public opinion outside Parliament in favourof Seretse&apos;s return would be very strong. We have always grounded our policy on the need to exclude both from the Reserve, and it would be difficult for us to sustain the case for keeping out Seretse if we let Tshekedi back, unless we wereprepared to confess that we were yielding to fear of South African reactions. More-over, we should be overriding what the observers regard as the views of a substantial majority of the tribe. The Commonwealth Secretary believes that we shouldultimately be forced to allow Seretse back if we once allowed Tshekedi in and inthe last resort he would prefer to go the whole hog and let Seretse back simul-taneously rather than be pushed along reluctantly to allow him back in the end.13. Therefore in practical terms the question is whether to let both Seretseand Tshekedi back or to continue to keep both of them out. The issue for thepresent is whether Tshekedi and Seretse be excluded now. When, however, theWhite Paper period ends in 1955, Mr. Gordon Walker thinks that, in view of the distinction between their cases to which I have referred, it is conceivable thatTshekedi might then be allowed to return. He sees no possibility of Seretse Khamabeing allowed to return then.14. The Commonwealth Secretary wishes to emphasise that, apart from thepossibility of future trouble in the tribe if we let both go back, we have to considerthe reactions of South Africa. We must never forget that these Territories aregeographically and economically part of the Union.All the evidence that Mr. Gordon Walker can get shows that Union reactions to Seretse&apos;s return would be very sharp and serious. (They do not mind one way or the other about Tshekedi.) This is borne out by Mr. Strauss, the leader of theUnited Party, who says that he could not oppose any course of action that dr. Malan might take and that we must choose between Seretse&apos;s return and keepingSouth Africa in the Commonwealth. It is borne out by Mr. Paver, a progressiveSouth African who runs the African vernacular press there and with whomMr. Gordon Walker has had several talks. It is borne out by Sir Evelyn Baring.Finally, the United States Embassy in South Africa is understood to have madesimilar reports to Washington.All these authorities say that white opinion in the Union would be so incensedby what they would regard as the official blessing of the British Government uponthe principle of mixed marriage that it would unite behind a Government that was ready to take extreme action. We could no longer rely upon South Africa beingactuated by rational motives; nor upon the political divisions that now prevent the nationalists from pushing their views too far.15. There are two sets of action that could be taken by a South african government to our disadvantage:  (a) They might cease to co-operate in defence.  They would certainly press on with demands for the cession of Simonstown. We could not count ontheir ready co-operation in economic and financial matters.(b) They could make it virtually impossible for us to continue to administer the Territories. One of Dr. Malan&apos;s chief advisers has told us thatMalan has said he would &quot; blockade &quot; the Territories if we let Seretseback. Dr. Malan did not say this for our information and does not know that we have been so informed. If South Africa were preparedto face economic disadvantages to herself she could cut off the Terri-tories from essential goods and from their markets. She could alsogravely reduce their already inadequate revenues. Whether or notSouth Africa would go so far as this, she would certainly very soon come forward with strong demands for the cession of the Territories, perhapsafter fighting an election on the issue.
16. If we decided to reverse our policy about Seretse and Tshekedi, we would first have to make a careful study of how we should deal with an economic blockade of the Territories. There is, Mr. Gordon Walker thinks, little we could do-anaeven that would depend upon our spending very considerable sums of money, all of which might well be wasted. There would be a deplorable public conflicibetween ourselves and another Member of the Commonwealth which would bemade full use of by every ill-wisher of the free world with incalculable results.17.&apos; In any case (leaving aside the defence aspect) it seems to Mr. Gordor.Walker that, if we let Seretse back, we should be running a high risk of losingthe three Territories. This would, incidentally, profit Seretse not at all. For the sake of the not altogether undoubted rights of two men, we should be riskingthe liberties of nearly a million Africans. In the Secretary of State&apos;s consideredview these risks are too great for us to run.18. The Secretary of State therefore concludes in the light of all these con-siderations that he must recommend to his colleagues that the right course is to reaffirm the Government^ policy as set out in the original White Paper (Cmd. 7913)and continue to exclude both Seretse and Tshekedi. He therefore proposes thai,with the approval of his colleagues, he should issue a White Paper containing theobservers&apos; reports, together with an introduction briefly rehearsing the case, making it clear that the issue is limited to Tshekedi&apos;s return and showing that the observersagree that a majority of the tribe is against his return. This covering statement would then reaffirm the Governments policy as set out in the original White Paper.I annex a draft of the statement which Mr. Gordon Walker would recommend(Annex A).19. The Secretary of State recommends the immediate publication of this further White Paper. The situation in the Protectorate is unsettled and the locaiAdministration is anxious tc be able to state clearly the Government*s decision onthe observers&apos; reports. This will reassure the Bamangwato and steady the otherchiefs who are under great pressure from Tshekedi. He recently called a meeting in Mafeking of chiefs and persuaded them to sign a petition highly critical of theGovernment and asking for the return to the Reserve of both Seretse and Tshekedi.The chiefs have since explained that they were stampeded into signature of the petition, although they did not concur in all its terms. Something of Tshekedfsambitions is revealed by the line he took with the chiefs, namely, that they should all work for his return &quot; to take control and restore order among the Bamangwato &quot;in return for which he would undertake to work for the return of Seretse.20. One difficulty which will have to be faced is the insistent demand from the tribe that those followers of Tshekedi Khama who went with him into voluntaryexile should also be excluded from the Reserve. The Secretary of State feels very strongly that we cannot allow exclusion to be carried to this length and he intends to tell the tribe so very firmly. It is in the Government&quot;s interest that TshekedTsfollowers (some of whom are very able) should re-enter the tribe as we do not wanta system of councils to grow up consisting exclusively of Seretse&quot;s adherents.C. Conclusions21.   Mr. Gordon Walker therefore makes the following proposals:  (a) To reaffirm the Governments policy to exclude both Tshekedi and SeretseKhama for a period of not less than five years &quot; from March 1950,as prescribed in the original White Paper (Cmd. 7913).(b) To publish a White Paper embodying the observers&apos; reports and conveyingthe decision at (a).(c) To make clear to the Bamangwato tribe that we cannot give way to their pressure for the exclusion of TshekedFs followers and that the lattermust be received back into the tribe if they wish to return.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,22nd September, 1951.
ANNEX ADraft Text of White paper in July His Majesty^ Government invited Mr. H. L. Bullock, Mr. D. L. Lipsonand Professor W. M. Macmillan to visit the Bamangwato Reserve in the bechuanaland-land Protectorate to report on the attitude of the Bamangwato tribe to the return of Tshekedi Khama to the Reserve as a private person. Mr. Bullock and professor Macmillan have submitted a joint report and Mr. Lipson a separate report to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered the reports and wishto record their thanks to the observers for the diligence and thoroughness withwhich they performed their task.As stated in the White Paper on the succession to the chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe (Cmd. 7913) a judicial enquiry was held in 1949 under the bechuanaland Protectorate Native Administration Proclamation into the questionof the recognition of Seretse Khama as chief of the Bamangwato tribe. The judicial enquiry unanimously advised against the recognition of Seretse and recommendedthat his absence from the Protectorate was essential to the peace and good orderof the Bamangwato Reserve. They also recommended that Tshekedi Khama, whohad earlier gone into voluntary exile in a neighbouring tribal area, should not be permitted to return to the Reserve. His Majesty&apos;s Governments decisions, wherebySeretse Khama is required to remain outside the Protectorate and Tshekedi Khamato reside outside the Bamangwato Reserve for a period of not less than five years,were fully set out in the White Paper (Cmd. 7913) published in March 1950.In April 1951, Tshekedi Khama visited London and made representations tothe Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations against the order excludinghim from the Bamangwato Reserve. The Secretary of State was unable to accede to Tshekedi&apos;s request, but offered him certain conditional facilities to enable himto care for his private interests in the Reserve. Tshekedi Khama rejected this offer.Subsequently the following motion was debated on 26th June in the House ofCommons:  &quot; That this House deplores the decision to continue the banishment of tshekedi Khama from the Bamangwato Territory without hearing or inquiringinto the grounds for such banishment; and calls upon His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to rescind the order of banishment and allow him to dwell freely withinthe territory of his tribe.&quot;The motion was defeated.In the course of the debate on this motion the Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations offered on behalf of the Government to invite the tribe to hold afurther kgotla (tribal meeting), attended by Members of Parliament as observers,to ascertain the tribe&apos;s attitude to the return to the Reserve of Tshekedi Khama asa private person. Since the Opposition parties were unable to agree that any oftheir members should go to Bechuanaland to attend the proposed kgotla, it wasnot possible to arrange a Parliamentary delegation. His Majesty&apos;s government therefore invited Mr. H. L. Bullock, past president of the Trades Union Congress,Mr. D. L. Lipson, member of the Gloucester County Council and formerly M.P.(Independent) for Cheltenham, and Professor W. M. Macmillan, Director of colonial Studies at the University of St. Andrews, to go to the bamangwato reserve with terms of reference requesting them &quot; to report on the single questionof the attitude of the tribe to Tshekedi Khama&apos;s return to the Bamangwato Reserveas a private individual.&quot;The observers left the United Kingdom on 24th July and arrived in the bamangwato Reserve on 26th July. On .11th August they reported that they and the local Administration had been unable to secure the agreement of the presenttribal leaders to a kgotla attended by Tshekedi Khama and his followers. they therefore unanimously recommended that this proposal should be abandoned andthat they should proceed to assess the views of the tribe on the question of tshekedi Khama&apos;s return by means of a series of local meetings in every part ofthe Reserve. On 13th August the Secretary of State accepted this recommendation and agreed that endeavours to hold a kgotla of the Bamangwato tribe, attended by41245 &quot; c
Tshekedi and his followers should be abandoned. The observers then pursuedtheir task by attendance at a series of local meetings. They also saw and talkedwith Tshekedi Khama and his followers, chiefs from other parts of the bechuanaland-land Protectorate and the Paramount Chief of Swaziland. They returned to theUnited Kingdom at the end of August.In the opinion of His Majesty&apos;s Government the reports of the observers, ofwhich the full texts are appended, show that a substantial majority of the tribe is opposed to. Tshekedi Khama&apos;s return to the Reserve. His Majesty&apos;s government therefore see no reason to vary in any way the decisions set out in Cmd. Paper 7913,whereby Seretse Khama is required to remain outside the Protectorate andTshekedi Khama to reside outside the Bamangwato Reserve for a period of notless than five years from March 1950.
ANNEX BJoint Report by Mr. H. L. Bullock and Professor W. M. MacmillanI. BackgroundIn July last we were asked by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to undertake a mission in the Bamangwato Reserve of the bechuanaland protectorate. The object of our mission is best set out in the following extractfrom a letter addressed to us by Mr. Gordon Walker on 20th July:  &quot; As I have explained in the House of Commons, the purpose of your visitis to report on the single question of the attitude of the tribe to tshekedi khama&apos;s return to the Bamangwato Reserve as a private individual.As I also told the House, I intend to invite the Bamangwato tribe to holda special kgotla under the presidency of an impartial person in order to estab-lish their views on this question. I will cause my invitation to the tribe tohold this kgotla to be presented to them at a meeting with the tribal repre-sentatives in your presence. I have made it clear to the House that in my view this kgotla should be attended by Tshekedi Khama and his followers.I hope you will use your best endeavours and all the weight of yourinfluence to persuade the tribe to agree to hold such a kgotia and tore-emphasise to them that Tshekedi Khama has renounced all claims to the chieftainship. I would be grateful for your views and advice on details ofarrangements for the holding of this kgotla. Any decisions that have to betaken must of course be mine, but I shall much value your advice and recom-mendations. Please do not hesitate to consult and advise me on any mattersyou wish at any stage of your visit.I of course leave to your judgment any steps besides the holding of the kgotla that you may decide to take to ascertain for yourselves the views ofthe tribe on the question at issue and to consult with neighbouring chiefs andany other people you may wish to see. You may count on the full co-operationof my officers in any such steps that you may see fit to take and in all otherways.&quot;2. The circumstances in which the issue of Tshekedi Khama&apos;s return to the bamangwato Reserve came before Parliament are well known and need be recordedhere only very briefly. For 23 years 1923-49 Tshekedi Khama had ruled the bamangwato people as Regent for his nephew, Seretse Khama, the heir to the chieftainship. During all these years Tshekedi had been in the position of fatherand mentor to Seretse and had cared for his affairs within the Reserve. Differencesarose between them over Seretse&apos;s marriage in 1948. The tribe also was dividedon this matter, and at the instance of Tshekedi, a series of kgotlas was held todiscuss his position. Later a judicial commission was appointed to enquire intothe circumstances that had arisen. In consequence of that commission it wasdecided by the Secretary of State that the chieftainship should be held in abeyancefor five years and that Seretse Khama should for that period be required to liveoutside the Bechuanaland Protectorate. At the same time Tshekedi Khama was required to live outside the Bamangwato Reserve. These decisions, and the reasonsfor them, are recorded at length in the White Paper (Cmd. 7913) published in March1950.3. During the years of his regency, Tshekedi had cared for the cattle and otherproperty that appertained to the chieftainship, to himself and to Seretse. In 1950an effective distribution of this property was made. It is understood that, in fact,this distribution has given rise to disputes between the tribe, representing the chief,and Tshekedi, but such disputes will be a matter for the courts and do not concernthis mission.4. Since his departure, Seretse Khama has apparently experienced no difficultyin leaving his property within the Reserve to be managed by one Keaboka, fourthsenior member of the chiefly family, who has since been nominated by the tribe as its leading representative and its &quot; messenger &quot; for the purpose of dealing with government. Tshekedi, on the contrary, has not found it possible to leave his property to the care of a representative, and in 1950 sought and obtained the permission of the High Commissioner for a series of visits to the Reserve for thepurpose of managing his affairs. These visits were made the subject of representa-tions to the High Commissioner by representatives of the tribe, it being alleged41245 d
that his presence in the Reserve was repugnant to the tribe, which was disturbedas to the intentions of both Tshekedi and Government. It is understood that theSecretary of State entered into prolonged negotiations with the intention of arriving at an accommodation with Tshekedi Khama that would secure to him adequate control of his property and yet be acceptable to the tribe. Those negotiations failedand the Secretary of State thereafter decided that the interest of peace and good order within the tribe demanded the re-enforcement of the exclusion order againstTshekedi. Khama. Thereafter Tshekedi, having publicly renounced all claim tochieftainship, demanded the right of free access to the Reserve as a privateindividual. The issue found its way to Parliament, in order to satisfy which theSecretary of State offered to send observers to the Protectorate to report on the truestate of feeling within the Reserve.5. The Bamangwato Reserve has an area of 40,000 square miles and a popu-lation roughly estimated to be 100,000 people. Of these only rather less than 20,000belong to the Ngwato tribe proper, the remainder having from time to time brokenaway from their original tribes and affiliated themselves with the Ngwato tribe andacknowledged its supremacy. The Reserve is divided into nine districts, the chiefof which is that surrounding Serowe, which is also the capital of the Reserve. TheSerowe district is the stronghold of the Ngwato tribe proper, but a number of its members reside in the several districts and are normally amongst the most influen-tial persons in them. The dominance of the Ngwato is ultimately due to the geniusof Khama (1875-1923) who made his kingdom a rallying point for tribes scattered over the huge area in times when security was threatened from the North by raidingMatabele and from the South-East by the encroachment of European farmers.Khama&apos;s protection of the lesser tribes was made more effective by the backinghe himself enjoyed from the Government of his great patron, Queen Victoria. Yetat that time, and even later, the protecting Government was in no position toassume what has come to be known as &quot; direct &quot; rule over this vast territory, sothat from the beginning the Protectorate administration came to rely even for themaintenance of law and order almost entirely on the discipline enforced, until 1923by Khama, and latterly by the Regent, Tshekedi. In consequence of this, nativecustom has been distorted and the power of the Chief raised considerably aboveany checks traditionally exercised by the people of the tribe over the chiefs&quot;autocracy.6. It was the great achievement of Khama&apos;s system that the rule he imposedthrough Bamangwato Representatives with the backing of the &quot; regiments &quot; fromSerowe and ultimately of His Majesty&apos;s Government was loyally accepted and stillis by the out-lying dependants. More than once some of us were corrected and told not to speak or think, e.g., of Bakalaka or Bakalanga, since all claim to beBamangwato. Even if they have made little material progress these people werewisely allowed to retain their own tribal headmen and they continue to speakfour or five distinct languages.7. The Reserve, and all its people, are normally ruled by the chief, whooccupies his position by right of birth. To each district he nominates a personknown as the chiefs representative, who rules on his behalf. The system is Khama&apos;sand the agents of the system, though they may constitute something like a civilservice, were and still are drawn largely, though not now exclusively, from themembers of Khama&apos;s family, being thus undoubtedly also a privileged aristocracy.Their Office clearly brings some profit as well as social prestige and they are intensely-conscious and jealous of their order of precedence. In spite of the great almostuntracked distances this ruling class maintain close links with each other and withSerowe, where they frequently gather for meetings, and where, as a result, tribalpolitics often have the intensity and ferocity of a village family dispute. The unity of the tribe is, nevertheless, something very real and jealously guarded, even if thesystem is thus aristocratic and, although not exclusively, autocratic. Certainly itadmits of no organised opposition: to stand out against the ruling power on any major issue is to be guilty almost of treason.8. Yet there are certain checks upon the use of power by the chief. Thefirst of these is the kgotla, a meeting at which, in theory, every male adult memberof the tribe has the right to attend and to be heard. We return to the point that therecent exclusion of Tshekedi&apos;s supporters is based on the ground that they havetransferred their allegiance to another tribe, the Bakwena. Such kgotla meetingsmay take place at the village or district level, but it is accepted that all the great
affairs of the tribe are discussed and determined in the presence of chiefs&apos; repre-sentatives and tribal headmen meeting in formal kgotia at the Ngwato stronghold,Serowe. No vote is normally taken at such meetings. When all who wish havespoken the chief, or person presiding on his behalf, assesses the feeling of the meeting and announces his decision. In theory, as Tshekedi Khama had himself claimedlately, that decision may be his own and need not accord with the feeling of themeeting; in practice a strong chief can possibly go contrary to the views of themajority. The meeting in kgotla is, however, an essential part of the system of native rule and is accorded much respect by the Bamangwato as by other tribes ofthe Protectorate.9. The second check upon the absolute rule of the chief is the devotion totradition and to precedent embodied in the complex and unrecorded system of native law and customs. Tshekedi himself told us it is &quot; case law.&quot; Argumentsmay and do arise as to the particular application of native law and custom.(e.g., as to the present claims of Tshekedi Khama), but custom is certainly arestraining force of some potency.10. The Chieftainship of the Bamangwato has remained with the house ofKhama, to which both Tshekedi and Seretse belong and which has included among its members some very remarkable Africans. Of these last Tshekedi Khama isacknowledged to be one, but all members of the very large royal family, whatever their personal merits, are to be reckoned with as people of influence.11. The foregoing represents, in brief outline, the organisation of the tribeas it has existed for many years. It should be recorded that in recent months theAdministration has been engaged, we understand with success, upon a series ofreforms designed to establish more firmly the democratic principle. The intention is to establish councils on a new democratic model, comprising representativesnominated by the village kgotlas in each district of the Reserve, these councilsbeing advisory to the chiefs representatives, who would themselves be nominated by the district kgotlas and confirmed by the full (i.e., tribal) kgotla at Serowe.The district councils would in turn send representatives to a central council atSerowe, which would in due course become the constituted Native Authority, andin effect the executive, or working, committee of the tribal kgotla. In these reformsmembers of the subsidiary or &quot; allied &quot; tribes were to have equal standing with members of the Ngwato and, in fact, a number of them had been nominated both as chiefs representatives and council members. All progress on these reformsceased when the future of Tshekedi Khama came before Parliament. Then, asis well known, disturbances occurred within the Reserve.II. Moves towards a &quot; Joint &quot; Kgotla12. We arrived in the Reserve on 27th July and were met by the HighCommissioner and officials of the Administration, who most willingly placed them-selves at our disposal and helped us in very way without in any way interfering with our judgment concerning the things we desired to find out. Indeed, we had made our minds up from the time of the appointment that nothing should prevent us from coming to our own conclusions; we made this quite cfear to everyoneconcerned and it was appreciated by them.13. We immediately addressed ourselves to the task of securing agreement to a special meeting of the tribe in kgotla with Tshekedi Khama and his supporterspresent. It had been hoped that the invitation to convene such a kgotla would beextended, and the arrangements for it discussed, at a meeting attended by repre-sentatives of both the tribe and Tshekedi (the latter had not himself yet returnedto Africa). We were informed that the tribal representatives had resolutely refusedto attend such a meeting and we perforce agreed to see the parties separately. we saw representatives of the tribe on 29th July and the supporters of Tshekedi, headed by Rasebolai, on 30th July. On each occasion the invitation to take part in thejoint kgotla was extended on behalf of the Secretary of State by the HighCommissioner (on 29th July by Sir Evelyn Baring, and after his departure, onthe 30th by Mr. R. E. Turnbull). On the morning of the 29th the tribal representa-tives merely welcomed us as their guests and said that they were empowered to listen but not to answer. They agreed to meet us again, for informal discussion, inthe afternoon, but, in the event, maintained the same attitude.  They would not41245 d 2
give us a precise date for their reply, but, upon our representations of urgency,promised that it would be soon. On 30th July the supporters of Tshekedi welcomed the proposal for a joint kgotla and promised their full co-operation. It can be stated that on that occasion, and on every subsequent one of our meetings, the supporters of Tshekedi gave every evidence of desiring to face their opponents ata joint meeting. It was clear that our difficutlies in arranging it would lie only with the established representatives of the tribe.14. We also had informal talks with the lawyers representing both sides ofthe dispute stressing all the time the need for a large tribal kgotla with both sidespresent and taking part in the discussions so that we could obtain a free, fair and independent expression of opinion on the issue before us.15. Meanwhile, on 30th July, a meeting stated to be representative of the tribehad been convened in kgotla at Serowe and a reply on behalf of the tribe to theSecretary of State&apos;s invitation reached us through the District Commissioner on31st July. The reply was to the effect that the tribe regretted that only under the presidency of Seretse, Tshekedi&apos;s one senior in the tribe, would it be possible underBamangwato law and custom to permit Tshekedfs presence. It went on to suggestthat the interests of all would be best served if we agreed to travel throughout theReserve and make direct contact with the people in the villages and towns.16. At our invitation a small deputation, led by Keaboka, visited us informallyon the morning of 1st August. They enlarged to some extent upon the reasons forthe refusal (these reasons will be discussed later in this report) but were clearlyunwilling to amend their attitude.17. The refusal was firm, but we were not then disposed to accept it as final.It was, nevertheless, obvious that any process of persuasion would be prolonged and might even then be unsuccessful. It therefore appeared to us to be the wisercourse to adopt, as an interim measure, the suggestion of the tribal representativesfor a series of district meetings, in arranging which they were prepared to co-operate.It seemed, indeed, that quite apart from the knowledge we would gain of theReserve and its people a programme of such meetings might be the best means ofestablishing confidence in our mission and thereby persuading the representativesof the tribe of the wisdom of holding a joint kgotla.18. In the ensuing nine days we travelled an aggregate of 1,500 miles and werepresent, either together or separately, at 8 meetings attended by perhaps 4,000members of the tribe. Before our departure the tribal representatives, though theycould not agree to a joint kgotla with Tshekedi present, said they would not offerobjection to the presence at such local meetings of any of Tshekedi&apos;s supporterswho lived in, or happened to be present in, the several localities. In fact, supporters of Tshekedi appeared at only four of these earlier meetings. At Mahalapye some30 of them appeared before our arrival, but the reaction of the gathering was soantagonistic that they had no choice but to leave under police protection. AtMadinare nine of Tshekedi&apos;s supporters and at Bobonong one, appeared; in both cases the people refused to proceed with the meeting until after they had departed.At Sefhare (claimed by Tshekedi to be a centre where support for him is strongest)30 Tshekedi men, some of them from Rametsana, sought to attend the meeting atwhich 300 persons were present. Mr. Lipson intervened in their behalf and in this instance the Headman allowed them to remain. It is significant of the weight of influence attaching to rank that Tshekedi himself presently claimed that his Sefharesupporters owed this immunity to the seniority enjoyed by their foremost leader.19. The meetings were most successful in the interest they attracted. At all times the tribesmen were most polite and courteous, making us welcome, but they also made overwhelmingly clear their attitude to Tshekedi. This they did not byvote so much, although in one or two instances votes were .taken, but by methodsreminiscent of a Quaker meeting, i.e., after many speeches from the tribe theheadman expressed the spirit of the meeting. Often it was pointed out to us thatthe question we were putting had been answered by the tribe more than once ortwice before and that they had given clear and definite answers which left no room for doubt.20. On Friday, 10th August, we all three reassembled at Mahalapye andresumed our efforts to persuade the tribal representatives to agree to the holding of a joint kgotla. In those efforts we were supported by the Administration.  On
the morning of 11th August the High Commissioner met some 60 of the repre-sentatives and in the afternoon we saw the same people. Both meetings were unsuccessful and at the second the tribal representatives went so far as to suggestthat if they were pressed further on the pointthey would be unable to continue their co-operation with us, even limited as it was to district meetings.21.   Time had begun to press, and it was necessary for us to consider therecommendations we could make to the Secretary of State as to the proposed jointkgotla and our further programme. In the event, we advised the Secretary of State,strongly and unanimously, that the effort to secure a joint kgotla should be abandoned.   In doing so we further expressed our unanimous and unqualifiedopinion that the alternative programme of investigation upon which we were engaged would give us all the opportunity we needed to arrive at a true valuation of the views of the people of the Reserve on the one question that was before us.Our reasons for making these recommendations may be summarised as follows:  (1) The smaller informal district meetings which we had attended and which,as stated above, numbered in the aggregate some 4,000 persons, hadbeen a success in that we had been able to make intimate contact withthe rank and file of the tribe, many of whom freely expressed theiropinions in open debate.(2) The freshness of discussion at these meetings, and the variety of speakers,had been such as to rule out the possibility of wholesale previousdirection. It is true that the failure to arrange for a joint kgotla meant that Tshekedi Khama had had no opportunity to state his case in person to the people of the Reserve and that, consequently, we had had no opportunity to observe their reactions to such a personal statement.  Itis not for us to hazard conjecture as to the effect upon the tribe of astatement of his case by so compelling a personality as Tshekedi Khama,but we have no hesitation in recording our conviction that in theirpresent mood the people of the Reserve would not, in fact, give him ahearing.(3) To force the joint kgotla against the wishes of the tribal representatives would almost certainly be answered with a boycott by their supporters.The ability of the tribe to boycott a meeting had been effectivelydemonstrated in 1950, and we decided that a kgotla summoned in such circumstances, attended as would be likely only by Tshekedi and his supporters, would in no way advance the primary purpose of our mission.More was likely to be gained from the meeting, already arranged, withTshekedi and his people on his own ground where there would be no opposition and no difficulty in securing the attendance of his supporters.(4) Again, we had already received evidence of such strong feeling within the tribe that we could not ignore the possibility that, even if a joint kgotlacould be arranged, emotions might gain the upper hand and the kgotlaend in disorder.(5) Finally, although we had faithfully undertaken the task imposed upon us by the Secretary of State of seeking to secure a joint kgotla, it was thecase that native law and custom would make a full tribal kgotla essentialonly if a decision were required from the tribe. Our mission was onlyto assess the state of feeling within the tribe and our ability to do this in one large formal kgotla might actually be restricted.22. In making these recommendations we received the full support of theHigh Commissioner and the Administration. On Tuesday, 14th August, we learntthat the Secretary of State had accepted our recommendations and had decidedthat the intention to hold a joint kgotla could be abandoned in favour of ouralternative programme of investigation.III. Alternatives to the Joint Kgotla23. On Monday, 13th August, we met Tshekedi Khama at Rametsana, the locality within the Bakwena Reserve just south of the Bamangwato border towhich he had retired in 1949 and to which Seretse&apos;s father had been exiled by hisown father many years before. We held three private meetings with Tshekedi and attended a public meeting of fully 200 of his supporters, at which Chief Kgari ofthe Bakwena was also present. Tshekedi repeated the arguments which have become so familiar in interested circles in London.  He expressed the belief that
if he were allowed into the Bamangwato Reserve he could ensure a joint kgotla.As we state elsewhere in this report, remembering how the High Commissionersmeeting was boycotted in 1950, we did not share his confidence.24. On August 15th we were present at yet another district meeting atPalapye. A number of TshekedFs supporters sought to attend, but their presencewas resented by the mass of the people and the headman asked us to arrange forthem to leave before the meeting could proceed. Appeals failed to move the people,and after some discussion between ourselves we agreed that since it was theirown meeting the headman himself must take responsibility for asking them to go.25. On Thursday, 16th August, we held our final meeting in the Reserve, atthe capital, Serowe. This was a most impressive gathering of between 5,000 and,000 people, presided over by Keaboka as leading tribal representative, who had also invited the small European population of Serowe to be present as witnesses.Keaboka did not himself address the meeting except as Chairman to introduceus and state our object. If there were nominated speakers among those taking partthere were certainly more who spoke extempore and took their chance among the many who wished to speak. The refusal to agree to a joint kgotla was forcefullyexplained and on two occasions, by loud and spontaneous acclamation, the meetingleft no doubt as to the general feeling on the subject of Tshekedi&apos;s return. No recog-nised followers of Tshekedi were present and none sought to attend.26. In the afternoon of the same day we met and talked with more than,000 women of the tribe, a succession of whom passionately and even threateninglyelaborated the theme &quot; we do not want Tshekedi back.&quot; (Women, too, were theringleaders in the disturbance at Mahalapye that made it impossible for Tshekedi&apos;ssmall band of supporters to state their case at our meeting.) This we note as anovel departure in local custom, since it is not the women&apos;s habit to engage in political discussion. That they should have done so on this occasion is evidenceof the strong emotion they feel on the subject of the present dispute.27. On 17th August, at Gaberones, we met, in the morning, some of theleading Europeans in the Protectorate, members of the European Advisory Council.In general they confirmed our interpretation of views expressed at the tribalmeetings. They were helpful especially about the economic background, animportant aid to understanding, but outside the scope of this report.28. In the afternoon we met chiefs of other tribes in the Protectorate, withtheir leading advisers, in all some twenty-six members of the Protectorate AfricanAdvisory Council. It is of interest that this Council were strongly of opinion that full discussion demanded the presence of both parties to the dispute, expressingregret that the Bamangwato representatives failed to accept the invitation to attend.Tshekedi was present, and the fact that those who spoke did so in his favour is perhaps a tribute to his great personal magnetism, but it also reflected the pre-occupied concern of the speakers for the rights and privileges of Chiefs and chieflyfamilies.29. There was also made available to us for questioning a panel of respectedAfricans versed in native law and custom. It is evidence of the &quot;difficulty of inter-preting custom that Tshekedi objected to all three members of this panel (one ofwhom is an expert constantly used in the Courts) but by this we were not greatlymoved since there was now little that we had need to refer to them.30. We then left the Bechuanaland Protectorate for Swaziland, where, onMonday 21st August, we had the pleasure of meeting Sobhuza, Paramount Chief ofthe Swazi Nation, and his Council. The Paramount Chief, a very distinguishedAfrican, strongly urged that the Bamangwato dispute in ail its aspects be submittedto a conference of leading Africans. On a major issue, however, he was scepticalabout the very possibility of Tshekedi returning to his country as &quot; a privatecitizen.&quot;IV. Conclusion31. In pursuing our task many matters came to our attention but only uponone, the views of the people of the Reserve on this question of the return of tshekedi khama as a private individual, are we called to judge. On this one question wehave no hesitation in declaring that the return of Tshekedi Khama in any capacity
whatsoever at the present time and in the present circumstances would be contraryto the wishes of the majority of the tribe and bitterly resented by a substantial number. On this issue emotions now run dangerously high throughout the tribe.32. Only on one condition, that Seretse Khama were present to preside, would the people agree to hear Tshekedi. That possibility is outside our terms of reference.33. The main reason advanced to us, at our many hearings, for the refusal to hold a joint kgotla in the presence of Tshekedi was this; that Tshekedi, havingleft the Reserve and declared his allegiance to the Bakwena tribe, had therebysurrendered his right to take part in Bamangwato tribal discussions, and that bydeparting from native law and custom so far as to permit his return to attend atribal kgotla, they would open the way to a resumption by him, by the mere forceof tradition, of all the authority that previously pertained to him as the seniormember of the tribe second only to Seretse. This argument rests upon the claim that by native law and custom Tshekedi&apos;s presence in a tribal kgotla would make him again a member of the tribe, and the rest would inevitably follow. We do not regard it as incumbent upon ourselves to pronounce upon this question of nativelaw and custom. It is sufficient to state that it is the view clearly and strongly held by the tribe. To them &quot; private citizenship &quot; is impossible to a man of Royalrank.34. In fact, the mass of the tribe reject Tshekedi Khama&apos;s declaration of hisrenunciation of all claim to the chieftainship. In their view, whatever the intentions of Tshekedi, once he was again received as a member of the tribe, his claim toseniority within the tribe would be inalienable, even by himself. It is their contentions-tion that in making this renunciation, Tshekedi Khama was appealing to a Britishway of thought, and one that he knew to be foreign to the Bamangwato.35. It must be recalled that the present division in the tribe arose not fromTshekedPs going but from Seretse Khama&apos;s defiance of tribal opinion by marryingas he did in September 1948 without the tribal sanction that custom demanded.The division only became palpable after June 1949 when, in the kgotla meetingcalled by himself, Tshekedi suffered political defeat. In this connection, we were impressed by the evidence that Tshekedi&apos;s action in leaving the reserve was indeed&quot; strictly in accordance with tribal law and custom.&quot; He then appeared to accept and act on the tradition that there is no place for an opposition party within the tribe, and at the tribal kgotla, and that a defeated leader can only &quot; retire to hiscattle post &quot; or, preferably, banish himself altogether.36. If western phraseology is at all applicable Tshekedi&apos;s Government suffered a parliamentary defeat on a vote of confidence. It appears to the tribe, therefore,that Tshekedi&apos;s demand for readmission to the Reserve goes back on his formerdecision and is an attempt to climb back to power, with his Ministers, with thebacking of the Bechuanaland Protectorate Administration and of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. It has even been suggested that the true analogy is to be found inCharles the First&apos;s dealings with his Parliament.37. At this point the conventions of the tribal aristocracy and hierarchy, andespecially their general acceptance by the people, gravely complicate the issue. at every meeting we attended it was obvious how every man knows his own station,from the lowest to the highest, and it is particularly at the highest levels that thismatters. Genealogical tables are readily available making clear (what every tribes-man knows) the present rank in the hierarchy of the almost innumerable individualsof the Royal family Seretse is No. 1, Tshekedi No. 2, RasebOlai (Tshekedi&apos;s righthand) No. 3, Keaboka No. 4 and so to the nth. During our visit, Rasebolai No. 3 having been &quot; ordered &quot; out of Serowe by the tribal representatives was eventuallybowed out with salutations of &quot; Nkosi &quot; (Chief). At every point we were met bythe argument that these Royal rights are an inalienable birth-right.38. The chief fear is that if Tshekedi returns in the absence of a superior hewill and must step as of right into the position of Chief and bring about a counter-revolution and this in spite of what amounted to his constitutional displacementby the kgotla in 1949. It is, in fact, impossible to conceive of Tshekedi &quot; as a privatecitizen &quot; so long at least as the Serowe kgotla is the dominant factor in Bamangwatopolitics. If he is at liberty to attend he automatically becomes its chairman andruler, and he has himself gone so far as to claim that by custom the decision of the kgotla is the decision of the president alone.
39. In the course of our investigations we were faced with a series of personalgrievances, some of them dating from many years past, against Tshekedi. After23 years of personal rule personal grudges were perhaps to be expected. Therecan be no doubt of the great administrative ability shown by Tshekedi Khama inthe past, nor that he has great ambitions for the Bamangwato tribe. We received an impression, none the less, that if only for want of effective administrative machinery, Tshekedi&apos;s personal exercise of power paid little regard to the individual or his rights. It is significant that the spokesmen of the allied tribes in the &quot; backblocks &quot; were solid with those elsewhere in their expressed opposition to the return of Tshekedi. In their eyes even his laudable work for the Bamangwato secondary school at Moen (? g) involved them chiefly in the payment of a heavy cattle levywhich left so much less revenue for the establishment or development of schoolsneeded in their own localities. Clearly wishing to continue to enjoy greater freedom to manage their own affairs, the people now fear the return of this powerfulpersonality.40. We would record also that we have received ample evidence that thishostile feeling extends, in lesser but still large part, to the leading supporters of tshekedi, the so-called Rametsanes. It is our view that this feeling is one of suchstrength that the Administration may have to give this minority positive protection.Although the emotional storm makes it hard to judge the number of those whowould in different circumstances be prepared to follow Tshekedi, there is no doubtthat his active supporters include a high proportion of the ablest and administra-tively most experienced members of the Bamangwato and that their permanentexclusion from the Reserve would represent an impoverishment of the tribe.41. Perhaps our overriding impression is this, that the greatest need of thepeople of the Bamangwato Reserve is a period of peace to go about their everyday-affairs freed from the distraction of continuing disturbances resulting from consideration of the affairs of members of the chiefly house.H.

ANNEX CREPORT BY Mr. D. L. LIPSON1. The purpose of the visit of the three observers to the Bamangwato Reservewas to find out and report on one question only: whether the tribe was in favourof the return of Tshekedi to the Reserve as a private individual or not, he havingrenounced all claims to the chieftainship.2. It was originally hoped to obtain this information by the summoning ofa special kgotla to be held at the capital, Serowe, which Tshekedi and his supporters would attend. We were to convey to the tribe the invitation from the Secretary ofState to hold such a meeting.3. Our first aim was to get both the opponents and supporters of Tshekedi toagree to the holding of a joint meeting. It was necessary to approach each sideseparately in order to obtain consent. Soon after our arrival in the Reserve we meton two occasions representatives of the tribe who were opposed to Tshekedi andurged them to accept the Secretary of State&apos;s invitation. They answered that before giving their reply they must consult those whom they represented in the various districts from which they had come. Subsequently they declined the invitation.The reason they gave was that it would be contrary to &quot; native law and custom &quot;to hold such a meeting. Tshekedi, they said, had left the Bamangwato and gone tothe Bakwena tribe, to whom he now owed allegiance and paid taxes; he could not,therefore, take part in a kgotla of the Bamangwato. They declared that they were at war with the supporters of Tshekedi and could not agree to sit down at a meeting with them.4. Our approach to the representatives of the supporters of Tshekedi, whom we next met, resulted in an immediate acceptance of the Secretary of State&apos;s invita-tion. They welcomed, and to the end continued to ask for, a joint kgotla.5. The representatives of the tribe in refusing the Secretary of State&apos;s invita-tion said that they were willing for us to move freely throughout the Reserve andto attend kgotlas in the districts. These would enable us to ascertain the views ofthe tribe on the question of Tshekedi&apos;s return.6. We decided that it would be unwise at this stage to press our request fora special joint kgotla lest it might lead to the tribal representatives being unwilling to co-operate with us in the holding of the district kgotlas. They had already told us that if a special joint kgotla was summoned by the District Commissioner, whowas the legal Native Authority, they would boycott it, as they had done on a previous occasion. We should then be faced with the presence of only tshekedi and his supporters and that would not serve the purpose of our mission. We hoped,however, that if the district kgotlas were a success and we were able to convince the tribal representatives as a result of better acquaintance with us that we werewhat we^claimed to be independent observers, not concerned with taking sides asto whether Tshekedi should return or not, but only anxious to obtain the trueview of the tribe as a whole on this matter that they might later be willing to reconsider their decision against a joint kgotla.7. We then decided that in order to &quot;cover the whole Reserve it would notbe possible for the three observers to attend all the district kgotlas, so agreed togo separately on tour and each one of us to take his share of the meetings.8. Before doing this we held a tribal meeting at Mahalapye at which all three off us were present and spoke and heard the views of those present.9. At only one of the district kgotlas, that at Sefhare, were supporters of tshekedi allowed to be present, and there it was in consequence of a special appealmade to the headman. At this meeting the 300 present included 40 supporters of Tshekedi, some of whom spoke and were heard without interruption by the rest.10. These district kgotlas had this advantage: many of the speakers describedthemselves as private individuals. In this way we were enabled to obtain the viewof the rank and file. At a special kgotla the speeches would have been made bythe leaders only.11. All the same the district kgotlas were only a second best. Nothing could help us so much to form a true opinion of the views of the tribe as a joint kgotla41245 E
at which both parties to the dispute were present and were able freely to express their views.12. On our return from tour we made a further attempt to secure a jointkgotla. An appeal was made to 60 representatives of the tribe, but they persisted in their refusal.13. We three observers then went to Rameisana to meet Tshekedi and 200 ofhis supporters who were there with him. We had three meetings with Tshekedipersonally and one with his supporters. He and other speakers declared that herenounced all claims to the chieftainship, had committed no crime, all that he askedfor was permission to return to the Reserve as a private individual and look after his own personal affairs. (He is the owner of a large number of cattle, the majorityof which are in the Reserve, and maintained that their proper care required his personal visits to the cattle posts in the Bamangwato territory.) He asserted thathe had been banished without trial not by the tribe but by the British Government.14. The Rametsana meeting was followed by two others, one at Palapye andthe other at Serowe. At the former, attended by about 400, the headman insisted on the exclusion of 5 Tshekedi supporters who had come there. A strong protestwas made against their exclusion, but efforts to secure their attendance did not succeed, and the meeting proceeded without them.15. The exclusion here and at other meetings of supporters of Tshekedi wasproof of intimidation. It is true that the number excluded was small but it is reason-able to suppose that there were many other supporters of Tshekedi who were afraidto attempt to attend meetings because they feared violent treatment from their opponents.16. The Serowe meeting was the largest we had attended. There were over ,000 present. A final appeal was made there for a joint kgotla. It was pointedout to those present that, large and important as the meeting was, it was not the kgotla which the Secretary of State had hoped would take place because it wasrepresentative of only one side. The appeal fell on deaf ears. There can be little doubt that the representatives of the tribe had made up their minds before we entered the Reserve not to accept the Secretary of State&apos;s invitation to a joint kgotla.They paid no heed to the arguments used in favour of acceptance. In my opinionone reason for their refusal was their fear of the influence the presence of tshekedi and his supporters at a joint kgotla might have in winning over some of their sup-porters to his side. The experience of the meeting at&quot;Sefhare showed that it waspossible for supporters of Tskekedi to be present at a kgotla and speak without fearof violence, if the leaders gave their consent to their being present. The blame,therefore, for the refusal to hold a joint kgotla rests entirely on the representativesof the tribe. I believe that, if they had agreed to a joint kgotla, their followers wouldhave accepted their decision.17. In the afternoon we attended a meeting of the women of Serowe at their special request. This was a unique event since the kgotlas were attended only bythe male population; women had never before held such a meeting. Between 1,200and 1,500 women came to the meeting and many of them spoke. They pursued thesame anti-Tshekedi line which we had heard from the men speakers at their kgotlas.If anything they were more bitter in their denunciation of Tshekedi and indulged inmore threats against his person, if he returned to the Reserve, than we had heard from the men. It is a matter of conjecture how they came to be so violently anti-Tshekedi.18. In the course of these meetings we addressed between us from 11,000 to12,000 of the adult population. It was quite clear that the overwhelming majorityof them were strongly opposed to Tshekedi&apos;s return under existing circumstances.The principal reasons for this appeared to be:  (a) They held Tshekedi chiefly responsible for the banishment of Seretse. This,of course, is not true. They believed that his opposition to Seretse&apos;smarriage was due to the desire to obtain the chieftainship for himself.(b) Tshekedi had been Regent during Seretse&apos;s minority for 22 yearsand had certainly many achievements to his credit, but it was alleged that his rule had become increasingly autocratic, harsh and cruel andthat in the carrying out of schemes, excellent in themselves, he had show no consideration for those who had to do the work they entailed.
(c) They insisted that it was not possible for Tshekedi to return to the tribeas a private individual; he was by birth second in rank only to Seretse.If he returned, while Seretse was absent, he would automatically havethe right and influence which his royal birth demanded according tonative law and custom. &quot; He was a chief by birth,&quot; they said, &quot; onlyGod could take his right away.&quot; In practice, therefore, it is not possiblefor Tshekedi to live in the tribe as a private individual in the absence of seretse.(d) They further declared that according to native law and custom Tshekedi,before he could return to the tribe, would have to come and ask forforgiveness from the chief of the tribe and obtain his consent to bereadmitted. In view of Seretse&apos;s banishment the tribe had no chief and,therefore, there was no one to whom Tshekedi could make his appeal.19. During the course of our three weeks&apos; stay in the Reserve we also dis-cussed the question of Tshekedrs return to the tribe as a private individual withthe lawyers representing both parties to the dispute, with representatives of the traders in the Reserve, with the European and African Advisory Councils, andother leading African chiefs. After leaving the Reserve we visited Swaziland andhad a very interesting meeting with the Paramount Chief, Sobhuza, who discussed with us the reactions of the quarrel in the Bamangwato on the African race.20. The meetings we had attended gave the impression that there was an overwhelming majority against the return of Tshekedi but, before coming to this conclusion, there are other factors to be taken into consideration. Tshekedi wasbanished from the Reserve. His opponents, on the other hand, were in control ofthe tribe and were free to organise opposition to his return. The Secretary of state had undertaken that, if a special joint kgotla took place, the banishment of tshekedi would be suspended for the three weeks during which the arrangementsfor it were being made. He would then have been free to visit the Reserve, organisehis supporters, deal with any attempts at intimidation of them and encourage themto come forward openly in his support. Further, at the joint kgotla he wouldhave the opportunity of stating his case and attempting to remove what he con-sidered to be unfair accusations against him. Tshekedi is undoubtedly a man of very great ability and, in view of this and of his right of precedence, his presenceat such a kgotla might have influenced many to have changed over to his side. Itwould also have been possible to have put to the test the fears that were expressedin some quarters that his return to the Reserve would lead to serious violence and disorder.21. It is not easy to assess what proportion of the tribe would have been wonover to favour Tshekedi&apos;s return if he had been as free to make out his case for it as his opponents were to make out theirs against it. My own view is that, in spiteof all that Tshekedi could have done, there would still have been a substantial majority against his return, so long as Seretse remained in exile. The chief fearof very many of those who were opposed to Tshekedi&apos;s return would probably beremoved had Seretse also been allowed to return. They would, for the most part,acquiesce in his return, if Seretse were back in the tribe as chief and agreed thatTshekedi might rejoin the Bamangwato. Meanwhile conditions in the tribe aredeteriorating owing to the lack of strong leadership.D. L. LIPSON.21th August, 1951.
