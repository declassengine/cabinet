Printed for the Cabinet.   October, 1951CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   ^ VCP. (51) 2644th October, 1951CABINETCONTINUANCE  OF THE FESTIVAL PLEASURE GARDENSMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Festival Pleasure Gardens first came to the notice of the Government late in 1948 as a project in which the London County Council were keenly interestedfor providing a permanent recreation and amusement centre in London on thegeneral lines of the Tivoli in Copenhagen. During the detailed examination of thescheme the L.C.C. elections in the spring of 1949 resulted in a political deadlockin London government. The attitude of the London County Council became muchmore reserved, and although a five-year run was recommended in order to try outthe project and to spread over a reasonable period the capital expenditure involved,the London local authorities were not prepared to commit themselves to anythingbeyond a scheme for the period of the Festival. This uncomfortable compromisewas adopted. My colleagues will be familiar with the troubles which then ensued further delays and increased costs resulting from the devaluation of sterling, thefailure to obtain a satisfactory management for the one-year scheme, the labour disputes, the unfortunate choice of the main contractor, the appalling weather andthe completion of the work more than a month late at a greatly enhanced cost.2. Although the summer of 1951 has not been particularly fine the experiencesince opening the Gardens has by contrast been most encouraging and has givensolid confirmation that a great popular demand exists for such facilities in London,and that the promoters of the Gardens have been singularly skilful in gauging and incatering for this demand from a broad cross-section of the public.3. Attendances up to 27th September have been 7,167,200 and they promise to exceed not only the original estimate of 6 million over the longer season, but the recently revised total of 74- million. On the basis of actual operation and of a detailed financial review by the Chairman, Sir Charles King, it has been estimatedthat the total gross income for the whole season will be  1,153,000, and the totalexpenses, after allowing for contingencies, will be about  500,000, giving a grossoperating profit of  653,000 to set against the net capital expenditure of  1,853,000assuming satisfaction in full of all disputed claims, and of liabilities for winding up and reinstatement, which allows for salvage amounting to  89,000.4. The reconstituted Board have also, at my request, furnished me withestimates of expenditure and revenue on the assumption that they were invitedand empowered to continue operation of the Gardens for a further period, whichhas been taken for the purpose of their calculation as two years. These would,without very substantial alteration, apply to, say, five years, which would be a more reasonable period to take, with the qualification that more capital works would be needed, but amortisation would be spread over a longer period. The Board estimate that maintenance and operating costs in future years would be about  400,000 perannum, assuming opening hours from 10-30 a.m. to 11-30 p.m., or about  365,000per annum with reduced hours from, say, 2-30 p.m. to 10-30 p.m. to cut out doubleshifts. &quot; Capital &quot; expenditure totalling  150,000 would be needed over the second and third years, but a large part of this (at least one-third) would in terms of worksconsist of maintenance and something under 10 per cent, of sanitation. Very little of it would be new construction or extensions of buildings.   There are obviousTHIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE   PROPERTY  of  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS -GOVERNMENT
difficulties in estimating the post-Festival revenue, but the Board consider thatone-half of this year&apos;s revenue, say,  580,000, would be a &quot; safe&quot; figure, that two-thirds, or  775,000, would be an &quot; optimistic &quot; figure, and that a repetition of this year&apos;s revenue would be &quot; most optimistic.&quot; They therefore conclude thaton a conservative estimate an extension for two years would not lose money andmay result in an operational profit ( 212,000), while on the higher figures it is by no means impossible to achieve a surplus of over  600,000, by obtaining a revenue of  1,550,000 against an expenditure of , 880,000- 950,000.5. My own view is that, given average weather and continued energeticmanagement, the Gardens have great revenue-earning possibilities even after the festival, and ought, if continued for five years, to be able to repay a substantial part at any rate of the loan indebtedness of some  1,172,000 which seems likely tobe outstanding at the end of this season. This assumes the Company repays 250,000 (see paragraph 11) and that  200,000 working capital is left with theCompany for continued operations after this season&apos;s liabilities have been met.This working capital will be produced by retention of existing revenue and hencedeferment of repayment of loans. (The total amount actually lent to the company at present is  1,432,000. Actual expenditure on capital and current account com-bined at the end of the first season looks like working out at about  2,353,000, i.e.. 1,853,000 plus  500,000. The loss-i.e., the net deficit-at the end of the firstseason will be about  1,200,000.)6. This and the following paragraphs deal with other general considerations which arise.Public DemandI am convinced that public opinion generally supports the continuation of thePleasure Gardens for a further period of years, and that if they were terminateda strong demand for some new permanent facilities of this kind would immediatelyarise. The London County Council appear to share this view and they have by amajority passed a resolution on 31st July definitely committing themselves that ifas a result of detailed examination &quot; a continuation should be decided upon theCouncil would not raise objection to enabling legislation to permit an extensionof iiOi. more than five years, but . . . that there should be an experimental periodof two years after the conclusion of the Festival before any decision is taken for or against a permanent continuance and that the consent of the Council should berequired to any extension beyond two years.&quot;Tourist Aspects7. The tourist attractions of the Gardens are particularly important in viewof the worsening of the balance of payments and the success achieved this seasonin breaking all previous records (tourist traffic for the first eight months of 1951is estimated at 515,000 or 14 per cent, higher than for the same period last year,and August tourist traffic was 21 per cent, above last year and 68 per cent, morethan the pre-war average). According to recent checks over three complete days70-80 per cent, of the Festival Gardens visitors have proved to be Londoners;18-25 per cent, provincials and 1^-5 per cent, overseas visitors, the lower figure for overseas visitors being after the middle of September when the tourist seasonwas ending. A very rough comparison with tourist figures indicates that the Gardens have been attracting the equivalent of one visit from something like one-third of the tourists arriving in this country, despite the strong competition of the South Bank, which is now ended. There seems little doubt that, continuanceof the Gardens would be a substantial competitive factor in attracting tourists,and the British Travel and Holidays Association have gone on record to this effect.Economic Aspects8. On grounds of saving man-power, as well as costs of operation, there maybe something to be said for limiting opening hours of the Gardens in the next twoor three years so that not more than one shift of staff is required for them, asproposed in paragraph 4. It is impossible to estimate how far public spendingfit the Gardens hits other enterprises, but there is no reason to believe that the neteffect is harmful. Some of it is no doubt at the expense of various forms of racingand gambling; while some of it probably diverts money from cinemas in which thereis a considerable dollar spending element, and some of it encourages Londonersto amuse themselves in London instead of travelling to resorts, where they would
create consequential demands for vehicles, oil and road maintenance. Continuanceof the Gardens would itself require appreciable man-power and materials, but on balance it seems reasonable to assume that even in present economic conditionslarge attendances at the Festival Gardens are an advantage rather than a burden on the national economy.Competition with other Enterprises9. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that amusement and other industries will tend to blame any worsening of their position on the Festival Gardens and willeye narrowly any competitive privileges. It seems fair that if the Gardens aredecided by Parliament and the London County Council to represent the best wayof using this part of Battersea Park for the amenity and recreation of the publicno rent should be payable. The Gardens enjoy no privileges as regards entertain-ment tax. The Central Land Board see no objection to continuing the presentexemption from payment of development charge during such period as theGardens remain open, on the basis of legislation expiring within five years. Therecan be no question that the Company should pay profits tax and income tax if itshould eventually make a profit, but the question of the basis to be taken for depreciation and the point at which profit earning should be regarded as beginningrequires considerable discussion with the Inland Revenue. Finally, I understandthat the Board assume that in future years they will be liable to pay rates and havemade provision accordingly.Relation to Investment Programme10. Another source of possible embarrassment is the question of the appli-cation to the Pleasure Gardens of the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ ban on investment expenditure for entertainment purposes in excess of  5,000. The Board&apos;present estimate for &quot; capital &quot; expenditure in the next two years totals  150,000,but a good deal of this relates to gardening operations, dismantling, storing,re-erection and replacement of tentage, expenditure on vehicles, dismantlingstructures no longer required, fencing, clothing and expenditure on catering estab-lishrnents, which do not come under the ban. It also remains to be establishedwhether, according to existing practice, the Gardens rank for investment expenditurepurposes as one enterprise, or as a series of different restaurants, theatres, amuse-ments rides, &amp;c., sharing a single large site like the factories on a Government tradingestate. These matters are being examined in detail, but it is clear that in the eventof a decision to continue the Gardens Parliament must be told exactly what theposition is, and that the passage of legislation must be accepted as specificallyempowering the giving of permission for the minimum work necessary for theGardens to open in 1952 and 1953, even if some dispensation from the ban is involved. As the Economic Secretary to the Treasury told the House on 17th July:(Hansard, Cols. 1059-60)&quot;... the ban applies to Government-sponsored projects as well as to others. ... If it is thought advisable that the Festival Gardens should continuethat matter would, of course, come before the House as legislation would be involved, and it would be for the House to decide.&quot;Finance11. As I have already stated in the House on 24th July (Hansard, Col. 1871)&quot; Assurances that no fresh capital will be needed and that there will be substantialrepayments in reduction of the Exchequer loans already made are essential con-ditions for Government agreement,&quot; and I am satisfied that these conditions canbe met. I understand that I shall shortly be receiving from the Company a formaloffer to repay  250,000 from this year&apos;s working, and this will leave them with sufficient working capital to carry on and to get the Gardens into shape for next season, provided that they are able to settle the contractors claims in accordancewithuieir estimates. (If the estimated final payment to the contractor should be exceeded a corresponding amount of the  250,000 would have to be deducted orrefunded to them.) Assuming the full  250,000 is repaid on this season&apos;s working,the position agreed between the Government and the L.C.C. about future repay-ments, as and when they become possible, is:  (i) the Exchequer will get a further  20,000, i.e., the balance of the first 270,000 repayment;
(ii) of the next  500,000 the Exchequer will get  300,000 and the L.C.C. 200,000;(iii) the Exchequer will get the next  662,000.The L.C.C. have, however, received a guarantee that their total ultimate lossshall not exceed  40,000; their Resolution of 31st July mentioned above,reiterated theimportance they attach to this guarantee, and there would seem to be no possibilitywhatever of persuading them to abandon it. This means that if the total repay-ments by the end of 1953 had not reached  670,000 and it was decided at that stagenot to continue the Gardens, the Exchequer would have to refund to the L.C.C.a sufficient amount to bring the total repayment to them up to  160,000 (the 200,000 originally lent by them less the  40,000 they are prepared to lose). If,for example,  250,000 were repaid on this year&apos;s working, and a further  250,000by the end of 1953, the L.C.C. would receive only  100,000 from the company and would have to get  60,000 from the Exchequer, which would mean that thenet total return to the exchequer quer would be  340,000 on the three years.12. I propose, and I understand that the L.C.C. would agree, that the existingFestival Gardens Company should continue to operate the Gardens, and that in giving effect to any changes of personnel the Government should retain a majority on the Board of Directors as long as there is a large liability for loan repayment tothe Treasury. It is of the utmost importance that the Gardens should continueunder a similar type of management to the present one.Observance of Standards13. The general standards embodied in the Festival Pleasure Gardens atpresent are in general (subject to the usual chronic inadequacies of the cateringindustry) reasonably satisfactory and acceptable to all shades of opinion. Vigilancewill be necessary to ensure, if the Gardens are to continue, that there is no let-down of standards of any sort, and I would propose, with the support of the LondonCounty Council, that a strong directive should be given to this effect.Legislation14. Existing legislation authorising the Festival Gardens is contained in the festival of Britain (Supplementary Provisions) Act, 1949, and the Festival of britain (Sunday Opening) Act, 1951. Continuance will require amendment of the1949 Act to suspend section 3 dealing with dismantling and reinstatement for fiveyears (or for two years if the Government and the L.C.C. so decide); to repealsections 8 and 9 dealing with grants for landing stages, and possibly section 4dealing with action for nuisance; to perpetuate the Festival of Britain (Sunday opening) Act, 1951, in so far as it applies to the Festival Pleasure Gardens, and toinclude certain guarantees, e.g., of free public access to appropriate sections suchas the riverside walks for periods when the Gardens are not in operation and whenmaintenance work permits. Parliament has already had something close to aSecond Reading debate on the subject (Hansard, Cols. 1014-1088-25th June, 1951).15. The L.C.C. in their resolution of 31st July, 1951, also stipulated thatin the course of detailed examination the possibilities should be explored of (1) provision in the royal parks of games facilities which could otherwise beprovided in the Pleasure Gardens area;(2) reduction in the price of admission in future years; and(3) remission of admission charge for old age pensioners.I am taking these points up with Festival Gardens Limited, and in the case of (1)with the Ministry of Works, but I am not optimistic about being able to meet anyof them, and I gather that the L.C.C. may not press them very hard.16.   I am quite clear as a result of full examination that (a) the public want the Pleasure Gardens to continue;(b) continuance is in the interest of the taxpayer and of the national economy;(c) such practical difficulties as there are can be overcome provided an early decision is reached.17. I am sorry to trouble my colleagues with the matter at this awkwardstage, but I am compelled to do so as the Festival of Britain (Supplementary Pro-visions) Act, 1949, requires the Minister of Health (now Local Government and
Office of the Lord Privy Seal, SWA,3rd October, 1951.Planning) to make an order fixing an &quot; appointed day &quot; six months after the date onwhich the Gardens were first opened to the public, and binds the Company as soonas may be after the appointed day to proceed with reinstatement of the Park. Asthe Fun Fair was opened on 11th May and the Gardens as a whole on 28th Maythere is some doubt whether the appointed day ought to be 11th November or 28thNovember, but it would be undesirable to delay beyond 12th November, and ifthe Gardens are to continue a Bill must be ready for introduction immediately thenew Parliament meets, and the London County Council and the Company must begiven definite guidance about holding the position open until a firm decision canbe taken at the beginning of November.18. In view of the General Election I think my right course at this stage isto confine myself to seeking the authority of the Cabinet to: -(1) inform the L.C.C. and the public that the detailed examination promisedhas been carried out and has led the Government to the view that con-tinuance is practicable and desirable, and that legislation ought to beintroduced accordingly to enable the Festival Pleasure Gardens to becontinued for a period of up to five years, subject to cessation at theend of two years if the Government or the L.C.C. so desire;(2) arrange for Parliamentary Counsel to have Bill ready for introduction atthe beginning of the next Parliament if Ministers at the time so decide;(3) instruct the Board of Festival Gardens Limited and the Festival Office that pending a firm decision when the new Parliament meets they shouldtake such steps as are essential (not involving any expenditure beyond their already available means or forward commitments) to make it pos-sible to reopen the Gardens next year if continuance should be decided upon.R.
