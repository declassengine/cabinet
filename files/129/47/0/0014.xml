S  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY   OF  HIS  BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENT-Printed for the Cabinet.  August 1951SECRET Copy No.    31CP. (51) 23930th August, 1951CABINETWASHINGTON AND OTTAWA MEETINGS:   REVIEW OFBRITISH policy memorandum by the Prime minister as the Cabinet is aware the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs proposes,after attending the San Francisco Conference on the Japanese Peace Treaty, to visit Washington for talks preparatory to the North Atlantic Council first withMr. Acheson and then with Mr. Acheson and M. Schuman together. These talkscan only last a few days and the Foreign Secretary will then proceed to Ottawa,where the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Defence will join him in representing the United Kingdom at the North Atlantic Council meeting. Theagenda for the talks with Mr. Acheson and for the tripartite talks with Mr. Achesonand M. Schuman in Washington and the latest text of the agenda for the ottawa conference are attached as annexes to this Paper.2. Except in the matter of policy towards Germany, on which I am circulatingseparate memoranda, it is not likely that the Foreign Secretary will be called uponat these meetings to take decisions such as would require new instructions fromthe Cabinet at the present moment. Generally speaking, the line which he will follow is covered by existing agreed policy and, where this is not so (as, for example,in the matter of new American initiatives in regard to &apos;; closing the gap &quot; and inregard to a European defence force), either the position is so fluid that no concreteCabinet instructions are possible or the discussions are to be exploratory only and not intended to result in decisions. I think, however, that the Cabinet wiilwish to have this survey of the main issues likely to arise in the forthcoming seriesof discussions and of the line which the Foreign Secretary will pursue. I amgrouping the subjects under broad headings and not necessarily following the orderin the various agenda which in any case differ and to some extent overlap.3. It is, of course, possible that Soviet action at the San Francisco conference will be such as to upset the time-table for the Washington talks and even for the atlantic Council; and it cannot be altogether excluded that developments inSan Francisco might cause some interference in the broad policies which theWestern Powers have in mind to pursue at this series of meetings. This cannotbe foreseen, however, and the following paragraphs are based on the assumptionthat the Washington and Ottawa meetings will proceed as planned and that theWestern Powers will continue to follow the general course of policy which theyhave followed up to the present.I. Political Questions4. The primary object of the talks with Mr. Acheson will be for the two ministers to assure themselves that United States and British policy are substantially in line on major issues; and where there are divergencies to reconcile these ifpossible or find a means of minimising their effect.   The same applies generally41147 b
to the tripartite talks also, for, although we do not admit the principle of Anglo-United States-French direction in global strategy (as opposed to purely Atlanticstrategy), we must carry the French in most of the major political issues with whichwe are confronted.5. The second purpose will be to prepare the ground for the North atlantic council and to form some common idea as to the results which are to be expected from it. The three Ministers will also no doubt examine and agree upon the broadprogramme of discussion and action for the coming months, leading up to a second meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Rome later in the Autumn.6. The main political headings are the policy of containment of the soviet union and its satellites, the future of European integration and the atlantic community, policy in the Middle East and policy in the Far East. Subsidiary issues are the Italian Peace Treaty, Austria, Spain and the problem of protecting nationals in Eastern Europe.Survey of Progress in the policy of containment of the Soviet Union and iis satellites7. This item is placed first on the tripartite agenda in order that the three ministers may begin their meeting with a general survey of the progress made bythe West in containing Communism since their last meeting nearly a year ago andwith a discussion of future policy and action.8. Broadly speaking, I think the Foreign Secretary would be right in sayingthat His Majesty&apos;s Government consider events to have justified the policy adoptedby the West in this period. The policy of building up positions of strength and of offering firm resistance to any threat of aggression has been successful and theSoviet Union have suffered a series of set-backs. Apart from the successful armedresistance in Korea, we have provided the necessary deterrents to any move forward in Germany, Austria or Southern Europe and we have established without let orhindrance an Allied Supreme Command in Europe with additional American andBritish forces on the ground. We have instituted very substantial measures ofrearmament designed to maintain the deterrent effect of the Atlantic alliance andwe have refused to allow ourselves to be divided or turned from our purpose by soviet propaganda or by the Peace Campaign or by the perils of the four-power talks. These experiences suggest that we should continue to resist encroachmentsand to build up our strength, but without provocation, and that above all we must remain united.9. As our confidence and our strength revive, however, two concurrentdangers will have to be watched. The first is the risk that we might overlook ormisjudge the reaction of the Soviet Union to some element in our policy whichtouches a sore spot in their security or around their perimeter. Unless the western powers make careful assessments of these risks and agree upon them there will always be a danger that the Soviet Union might be provoked to preventive war or at least to move over to a war economy, while the Western defence preparationsare still at an elementary stage. This danger applies particularly to American policyin the Far East, but there are other matters, such as the establishment of air basesnear the Soviet borders, which might be equally dangerous. There is, indeed, a risk that, owing to impulsiveness or under the pressure of excitable public opinion,United States policy might go to unreasonable lengths. The Foreign secretary should utter a word of warning if and when appropriate against such tendencies.10. The second danger is that we might overlook the need for the western powers to be constructive and positive in their relations with the Soviet Union.If, for example, they do not show willingness to negotiate, they are likely to alienateimportant sections of Western opinion. This is not to say that the moment is ripe for the Western Powers to proclaim their willingness to enter into full-scalenegotiations with the Soviet Union with a view to a general settlement.11. Finally, it may be advisable for the Foreign Secretary to point out, asa prelude to the discussions which he and the Chancellor of the Exchequer willbe having at a later stage on the burden of defence, that the need to sustain morale and to maintain a reasonable standard of living amongst the peoples of the Westis just as important as the need to increase defences. Too much pressure to increasedefensive expenditure of nations which lack resources of economic wealth may bevery dangerous, and may result in opening the way to Soviet penetration and thusdefeating the very object of containment.
European  Problems and the   United Kingdom  Attitude  towards  Europeanintegration12. This item is placed on the bilateral agenda in order to give the foreign secretary an opportunity to explain to Mr. Acheson British policy towards theEuropean integration movement. This can be summed up as follows. We are willing to play an active part in all forms of European co-operation on an inter-governmental basis but cannot surrender our freedom of decision and action toany supra-national authority. We are quite ready to encourage continental countries who feel disposed to adopt such plans and in the case of the schuman plan have declared our wish to be closely associated with any Authority that maybe set up under it. We are considering the possibility of making a more definitestatement in this sense in the near future. We are also ready to look verysympathetically on the European Army Plan provided it can be shown to bemilitarily effective. We are anxious to develop the consultative role of the Councilof Europe which is the focal point of the European integration movement, andthe proposal that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should introduce to the consultative Assembly the Annual Report of the O.E.E.C. can be quoted as an example of our desire to encourage the Assembly to discuss serious matters.13. Broadly speaking, however, it is our aim to foster the idea of an atlantic rather than a purely European community, although we believe that closercontinental integration on a supra-national basis is not necessarily inconsistent withour conception of the larger entity. The Foreign Secretary might emphasise thepoint that the independent position of the United Kingdom enables us in co-operation with America to play a very special and important role in the free world;that closer dependence on the Continent would impair that position; and that it is thus in the interests both of the United States and of the other Western countries that we should maintain our independent position.14. Later, at the Ottawa Conference, there will be a discussion of means for developing the Atlantic concept and the non-defence aspects of co-operation withinN.A.T.O. and it is understood that Mr. Acheson will make proposals under this heading. The Foreign Secretary will be generally sympathetic towards the ideaof developing co-operation between the United States, Canada and Western europe on the Atlantic basis and will be favourable towards any reasonable proposals for strengthening the machinery of N.A.T.O. for these purposes. It is clearly in con-formity with our policy not to allow the North Atlantic Treaty to become simplya defence organisation designed to meet the present threat from the Soviet Union,but to keep alive the longer-term objective of an Atlantic community.Alignment of United States-United Kingdom Policies in the Middle East- 15. Egypt. We have reached a critical stage in our relations with Egypt.The Egyptian Government is threatening to abrogate at an early date the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, on which we base our right to station forces in the canal zone. If they do so, we shall of course stand on our rights under the treaty.According to present estimates, we shall be able to maintain our position in the canal zone, although with difficulty.16. It would of course be far preferable that we should have reached agree-ment with the Egyptians. We believe that our best, perhaps our only chance of reaching such an agreement is to make a new offer to the Egyptians, based on egyptian participation in the new Allied Middle East Command. Such an offer would not, of course, dispose of the Egyptian refusal to contemplate any solutionof the defence question unless we first satisfied their demands over the Sudan.There is, however, some hope that if the Americans support us in an offer to the egyptians of participation in the new Allied Middle East Command, they may agree to discuss the offer, leaving the question of the Sudan for the moment in abeyance.17. The Americans can help us by associating themselves with our offer, and,if the offer fails by supporting us in the stand we shall have to take.The Foreign Secretary will therefore make it his object to secure:-(a) American agreement on what we regard as our essential minimum require-ments in Egypt for the defence of the Middle East;41147 B 2
(b) full support in our attempts to secure them, and an undertaking that the americans will make it clear to the Egyptians at an early stage that their support will be forthcoming;(c) an undertaking to co-operate with us in an attempt to bring Egypt into theproposed new Middle East Command, as a possible means of solving the present deadlock to our defence negotiations; and(d) an undertaking to stand by us if negotiations break down, leading perhaps to serious trouble in the Canal zone or to an argument in the security council.18. General. The problems of the Middle East vitally affect american interests as well as our own, and we readily admit that we cannot tackle them alone.Such questions as Arab refugees, economic development and, above all, defence,need co-ordinated planning.The Foreign Secretary will therefore suggest to Mr. Acheson that we shouldreaffirm the principle that, in all matters where our common interests are involved,we should always consult each other at an early stage in the formation of policy.19. Kashmir. At the end of September Dr. Graham, the United NationsMediator, is due to report to the Security Council. We expect him to reportfailure to effect the demilitarisation of Kashmir. At about the same time the Con-stituent Assembly of Indian-occupied Kashmir will be convened. Both events will increase tension, and are likely to lead to heavy Pakistan pressure for action in theUnited Nations against India. We are anxious to avoid anything in the nature ofa Resolution which merely condemns India and leads to stalemate in the security council. We therefore hope to get the case referred to the Assembly if, as seems likely, it cannot be settled in the Security Council. As this subject was placed onthe agenda at the request of Mr. Acheson, the initiative lies with him. But theForeign Secretary will take the opportunity to make our views known to him, andwill seek his support for the proposal to refer the dispute to the Assembly.Alignment of United States-United Kingdom Policies in the Far East20.   Korea. The Foreign Secretary will wish to obtain assurances fromMr. Acheson on the following lines:  (a) That the policy of the United States Government is neither to withdrawprematurely nor to extend the war, and that they will continue to keepthe South Korean Government firmly under control to prevent themfrustrating United Nations policy.(b) That the United States and United Kingdom Governments shall consult together on further references to the United Nations regarding Korea.We consider that if an armistice is secured the matter should go at asuitable stage initially to the Security Council and then be referred tothe Assembly. In the event of no armistice it will be difficult to avoid a general debate in the Assembly in the form of an inquest.(c) If full-scale fighting breaks out again in Korea, we would still hope thatthe United States Government would agree with us that the campaignshould be confined to Korea and that a general offensive up to theManchuria border should not be attempted. We should stand moreor less on present lines, inflicting maximum loss on the enemy. Should,however, any Chinese offensive against the Kansas line be repulsed with heavy losses and general disorganisation, General Ridgway should have discretion to undertake tactical advances as is thought militarily desir-able to follow up the retreating Chinese. Should he wish to make a major advance such as to advance as far as the &quot; Northern Waist &quot; this would require the approval of Governments. If the new enemyoffensive included large-scale air raids from points outside Korea, wewould support a policy of retaliation. In that case we and the UnitedStates would have to reckon with the probability of general war with china, possibly extending to war with Russia.(d) If all goes well in Korea and the way seems open to a gradual general improvement in the Far East situation, we hope that it will not beblocked by a rigid United States attitude towards the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment. If an armistice is arranged, we trust that the UnitedStates Government will agree in principle to sit round a table with
representatives of Peking for the next round of talks which, in the firstinstances, should be confined to Korea. A meeting of representativesof some of the countries contributing aid to the United Nations in korea, together with the Russians, Chinese and possibly the Northand South Koreans, might be a suitable forum. The ground for thismeeting could be prepared by a specially appointed United Nationsrepresentative. If, in the view of the majority of the United Nations,a change-over in Chinese representation in the United Nations will contribute to a Far Eastern settlement we hope that the United StatesGovernment will accept the majority view. If we succeed in reaching asettlement in Korea we hope to pass on to wider discussions for ageneral settlement in the Far East. We do not, however, overlook thefact that even if an armistice is arranged we may have to face a pro-longed political stalemate on the basis of a divided Korea.China, including representation in the United Nations21. General Policy. Whilst the United Kingdom and United States Govern-ments are both building up strength and will resist Chinese interference in the affairs of others, our joint aim should be stability and peace by avoiding interference in Chinese internal affairs, by keeping open the small windows to the West thatare still in existence, and by consultation with like-minded Governments includingAsian Governments, and by the gradual relaxation of tension.22. Formosa. The Foreign Secretary will seek an assurance fromMr. Acheson that the assistance which the United States Government are giving toChiang Kai-shek is solely for the purpose of the defence of Formosa and will notbe misused for adventures elsewhere, including Burma. A policy of pin-prickingthe Chinese is futile and dangerous.23. Chinese Representation in the United Nations. Unless there is some major change in the situation (e.g., an extension of the Korean war), we should continueour present flexible policy of voting to postpone the question of Peking&apos;s admissioninto United Nations organs (i.e., the moratorium). If, however, an armistice is secured in Korea, the absence of Peking from the United Nations may be a majorstumbling-block in the subsequent political discussions. It is too early 10 decide whether it will be wiser to press for a change-over in Chinese representation in theUnited Nations before general political discussions, but the United States Govern-ment should be made aware that in our view Peking^ representation in the united nations will be an essential condition for a general settlement though we have atpresent an open mind on whether this change-over should take effect before or afterpolitical discussions. It might, for example, be left until after general agreement on the terms of a settlement in Korea and &quot;be conditional on such general agreement.24. Indo-China. The Foreign Secretary will enlist the support of M. Schumanfor the line he proposes to take with Mr. Acheson in the bilateral talks. M. Schumanis likely to refer to Indo-China. He may suggest an Anglo-United States guarantee of the frontiers of Indo-China; this is impracticable. He may ask for military support in the event of Chinese intervention in Indo-China. The Foreign secretary would in these circumstances assure M. Schuman that we are wholeheartedly behind the French in Indo-China and would do our best to help them, subject to our owncommitments at the time and to similar action being taken by the United States.He would then propose that a meeting of the United Kingdom-United States-French Chiefs of Staff should be held to formulate a tripartite military policy for south-East Asia and make recommendations to the three Governments.Italian Treaty revision, including Trieste25. The United States and French Governments agree with our view thatthe Italians have a strong case on military, political and equitable grounds for revision of their Peace Treaty. There are, however, serious difficulties (e.g. the yugoslav attitude and the fact that Russia is a party to the Treaty) and we considerthat the matter must be approached with caution. The first stage in our view andthe only one which for the moment we consider practicable should be a tripartite declaration by the United States, United Kingdom and French Governments oftheir intention to seek a revision of the military and economic clauses of the Treaty.41147 b 3
Formal action would require reference to all signatories, and would have to wait until the situation was easier. The French have accepted this position in principle.The American view is not yet known, but they are likely to minimise the difficulties and to favour immediate action for formal revision.26. The United States Government and His Majesty&apos;s Government haveagreed to urge the Italian and Yugoslav Governments to negotiate on Trieste assoon as possible, and it might greatly assist the Italian Government in presentingany settlement to their public if we could arrange simultaneous action on the peace treaty. Our first objective at Washington will, therefore, be to prevent hasty actionon treaty revision before the various difficulties and notably the question of Triestehave been disposed of. This may not be easy. The United States Government have invited Signor De Gasperi to Washington immediately after the Ottawa Conferenceand will not want to send him away empty-handed, and the French are, on general political grounds, anxious to help Italy over Treaty Revision.A ustria27. This subject was suggested by Mr. Acheson. It is likely that he will wishto discuss the two questions of Treaty Tactics and Occupation Costs.28. Treaty Tactics. The Austrian Foreign Minister has suggested that itwould be desirable to hold a meeting of the Deputies on the Austrian Treaty earlythis autumn, in order to reassure Austrian public opinion. The Russian attitude on this subject has for some time been uncompromisingly negative and shows no sign of changing. Moreover, when the Deputies last met, progress was held upover the question of Trieste. At present we are trying to persuade the italians and Yugoslavs to reach an early settlement of this question. If we succeed weshall be in a much better position to reopen the Treaty talks.29. The Foreign Secretary intends therefore to take the line that no meetingof the Deputies should be held in the near future, though, if necessary, a statementreaffirming the attitude of the Allies over Austria might be issued after the meeting with the object of heartening Austrian public opinion.30. Occupation Costs. We have been pressed by the United StatesGovernment to pay our own occupation costs in Austria. We have so far refused,mainly on the ground that the occupation costs at their present level represent a verymodest contribution by Austria to her own defence and that of Western Europe.It is not suggested that we should change our attitude.Spain31. When the United States Government decided to enter into militarydiscussions with Spain, Mr. Acheson assured Sir Oliver Franks that the questionof Spain&apos;s association with N.A.T.O. would not be raised, and that General Francowas only to be invited to discuss such matters as the provision of airfields for stagingaircraft through Spain. So far, the United States Government appear to have keptfairly strictly within these limitations, but General Franco has already asked formilitary aid for the Spanish Armed Forces and there is no doubt that he will press this demand in subsequent phases of the negotiations. He is also certain to drivea hard bargain over economic aid. Strong pressure will no doubt be exerted onthe State Department, not only by the Spanish Government, but also by the production-Spanish lobby in Congress and by the military authorities.32. In these circumstances the Foreign Secretary proposes to emphasize thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government remain firm in their opinion that any arrangementinvolving American military aid to Spain would,have most unfortunate results. Itis to be hoped that this will help to reinforce Mr. Acheson&apos;s position.33. If General Franco insists as his quid pro quo upon the provision of military aid, the Americans may propose to raise the problem of military aid for Spain inN.A.T.O. The Foreign Secretary would strongly oppose this suggestion, whichcould only lead to an open disagreement between the Americans and ourselves in N.A.T.O. The French would be likely to support our point of view strongly,though there is less certainty in the case of certain other N.A.T.O. members,notably Italy.   .
The Protection of nationals in Eastern Europe34. Mr. Acheson put this question on the agenda, probably as a result of therecent imprisonment of Mr- Oatis, an American citizen, in Czechoslovakia and oftheir experience in connexion with the imprisonment and release of anotherAmerican, Mr. Vogeler, by the Hungarian Government. He is likely to suggestthat we should agree on a common policy to prevent further cases of this kind.35. The Foreign Secretary will suggest that it would be very difficult to workout any rule of thumb for dealing with such cases, and that each case should beconsidered on its merits. He will assure Mr. Acheson that we are not prepared toaccept terms for the release of Mr. Sanders (a British subject at present in prisonin Hungary) which might prejudice the security of the Western Powers. On thepoint of principle, he will emphasise that, while it may be possible in particular cases to bargain with the satellite Governments for the release of individuals.His Majesty&apos;s Government consider it dangerous to accept the principle ofransoming &quot; such persons, because it would merely encourage the satellites topersecute foreigners.II. Defence Questions36. The most important of the Defence Questions to be considered at the tripartite meetings is &quot; the European Defence Force and the problem of an earlyGerman contribution with particular reference to procedure and methods.&quot; Thisis dealt with in separate Cabinet papers, and I need only say here that the discussions in Washington on this topic are intended to lead up. not to the Ottawa meetingof the Council (where it is unlikely that the subject will be touched on except in themost general terms), but to the later meeting of the Council in Rome. The othermain headings under defence are Atlantic and Mediterranean Commands and thequestion of Greek and Turkish accession to N.A.T.O., with which is connected thequestion of the Middle East Command.Atlantic and Mediterranean Commands37. The Americans may press for finalization of the Command arrangementsfor the North Atlantic Ocean. Earlier in the year there was, as the Cabinet know,general agreement within N.A.T.O. to the appointment of Admiral Fechteler as supreme Allied Commander, North Atlantic Ocean, but after the public criticism of this appointment in Parliament the Americans announced that they were not ready formally to approve the arrangements.38. We ourselves have been taking the line that the final announcement ofthis appointment should not be made until the establishment of an equivalentCommand under a British Supreme Commander either in the Mediterranean or inthe Middle East could be announced. The agreement now reached in the StandingGroup is that there shall be a Supreme Command, Middle East, under a BritishSupreme Commander but that there shall be no Supreme Command in theMediterranean. Admiral McCormick, who has succeeded Admiral Fechteler as commander-in-Chief of the United States Atlantic Fleet, is expected to be nominatedas Allied Commander Atlantic Ocean and the Foreign Secretary proposes to agreeto the announcement of his appointment provided that at the same time the wilfing-ness of the three Standing Group powers to take part in a Supreme Command inthe Middle East under a British Supreme Commander is announced.39. In the Mediterranean it is proposed that there shall be two Naval Com-manders-in-Chief, the American Admiral commanding United States Naval forces and being primarily responsible for supporting General eisenhower&apos;s right flank;and the British Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean, commanding all british naval forces and naval bases in the Mediterranean, with primary responsibility for supporting the Supreme Allied Commander in the Middle East. There will naturally be very close co-operation between the two Allied commanders, who willwork out together the division of their responsibilities throughout the Mediterranean.It is likely that there will be a subordinate French command in the western mediterranean.
Greece and Turkey and the North A atlantic Treaty Organization40. One matter on which it is hoped to reach positive decisions at the ottawa conference is the admission of Turkey and Greece to the North Atlantic Treaty.As my colleagues are already aware, His Majesty&apos;s Government have committed themselves publicly to support the admission of these two countries and assurancesto this effect have been given to the Turkish and Greek Governments. In the caseof Turkey, we have made it plain that we should expect her, once she is admitted to the Treaty, to play a full part in the defence arrangements for the Middle East.We have received repeated assurances from the Turks that they are prepared to do this once they have been admitted to N.A.T.O.41. This decision was reached by us reluctantly because we were satisfied thatthe United States Congress could not be persuaded to offer guarantees to turkey and Greece in any other form. The French Government, with even more reluctant-tance, now appear to have reached the same decision. But a number of the lessermembers of N.A.T.O. are still unconvinced of this and are advocating the eonclu-sion of a Mediterranean or Middle East Pact as an alternative method of securingthe co-operation of Turkey and Greece in Western defence. The Report of the deputies, which wifl be under discussion at Ottawa, brings out these conflictingopinions.42. The first part of the task at Ottawa will be to convince these governments that there is no prospect of any alternative of this kind being accepted and thatadmission to N.A.T.O. is the only solution. The objections likely to be expressedfall under two main heads. First, that the arrangement extends unduly the area ofresponsibility of member countries (such as the Scandinavians and Benelux) whohave no special interest in the Middle East; and second, that the admission ofTurkey and Greece into the N.A.T.O. family will destroy the &quot; Atlantic concept &quot;on which the treaty is based. It may be possible to allay to some extent the first ofthese fears by means of the Command p.rrangements which are being worked outin the Standing Group, whereby the defence of the Middle East area, includingTurkey, would be regarded as primarily the responsibility of a Middle East Com-mand not fully answerable to N.A.T.O. as a whole. As for the second, it may bethat the proposals which Mr. Acheson intends to put forward for strengthening the atlantic concept and fortifying the non-defence aspects of the Treaty will meet these objections to some extent.43. Assuming, however, that the basic opposition of certain members to the admission of Turkey and Greece can be overcome the second part of the foreign secretary&apos;s task will be to safeguard our thesis that Turkey must be primarily asso-ciated for defence purposes v/ith the Middle East Command under a British supreme commander. Despite the agreement in the Standing Group on the main principlesof such a Command, and of Turkey&apos;s participation in it, we are by no means certainthat the Americans genuinely support the arrangement and there is a lot of evidence which suggests that they would prefer to bring Turkey under General EisenhowersCommand. They have persistently expressed the view that no prior conditions mustbe attached to Turkey&apos;s admission and have been reluctant to agree that commandquestions should be discussed at all at the Ottawa meeting. Our own idea had beenthat the N.A.T.O. Powers might agree in principle at Ottawa to the admission ofTurkey and Greece, and that discussions might then have taken place with thesetwo countries as to how they would fit in to the Command Organisation, on theunderstanding that Turkey has undertaken to play her full part in the Middle East.The formal invitation might then have followed at the Rome meeting of the Council.Unfortunately we have now been informed officially by the Turks that they will not take part in conversations about the proposed Middle East Command Organisationuntil they can do so as parties to the North Atlantic Treaty. We shall therefore be obliged to modify our programme. If we leave the discussions with the Turks until after the Rome meeting of the Council it may be too late to utilise the establishmentof the Command as a possible solution of our dispute with Egypt, which is one ofits main advantages to us. We must therefore find some means of giving the Turkssufficient satisfaction at Ottawa to induce them to enter into discussions with us atonce, and this may mean agreeing to an invitation to them to join N.A.T.O. with-out any assurance, other than those which they have given orally but categoricallyto us, that they will in fact join in the Middle East Command. This is a risk whichwe may have to take, placing reliance on the word of our Turkish allies.
III. Economic QuestionsEast-West Trade44. The only fixed item of an economic nature on the agenda of the bilateral .talks is the question of East-West trade on which the Foreign Secretary will take theopportunity to re-state the importance which we attach to the supplies which weobtain from Eastern Europe. He will take the opportunity of explaining once moreour objections to the use of United States assistance to dictate the trade policy ofother N.A.T.O. countries, a procedure which is endorsed in draft legislation atpresent before Congress, and will wish to make it clear that in deciding our own policy we shall not be influenced by the provisions of any United States legislation,although we shall continue to co-operate with the United States Government andother friendly Governments on.East-West trade policy.United States Attitude towards the Economic Aspects of the Defence Programmes45. In Ottawa there wili be an opening clash of opinion with the United StatesGovernment about the economic implication of the N.A.T.O. defence programmes.Though the responsibility for presenting the point of view of His Majesty^ Govern-ment in this part of the discussion in Ottawa will fail primarily on the Cnanceiior ofthe Exchequer and Minister of Defence the issues at stake will be fundamentallypolitical and the Foreign Secretary will wish to share the responsibility with hiscolleagues. Moreover, both he and the Chancellor may find it desirable to explore the political and economic aspects of the subject with the Administration inWasnington in advance of the meeting in Ottawa. The United States authorities,including in particular the United States Deputy, have openly declared what themain objective of the United States Government will be at the meetings in Ottawaand Rome. To quote from a statement circulated by the Deputy they think that &quot; itwould be appropriate for decisive action to be taken at the October meeting aimed at meeting the total requirements of the Medium Term Defence Plan,&quot; i.e., the planwhose fulfilment the military Standing Group of the N.A.T.O. have declared to be essential if the North Atlantic area is to be made militarily secure by 1954. Tnereis in fact a large gap between the requirements of this plan and the total contribu-tions which the N.A.T.O. Powers have severally undertaken to provide and thepurpose of the United States representatives in Ottawa will be to persuade therepresentatives of other Governments that it is not only necessary but within the capacity of the various countries concerned to close this gap by 1954. The UnitedStates Government do not appear to contemplate any increase in their own defence programme for the next three years and the amount of military aid to othercountries which they are thinking of asking Congress to note in 1953 is no morethan they have recommended for the present year. They are in fact looking to theother N.A.T.O. countries to make the principal contribution towards closing the gapand there is a hint in the Deputy&quot;s statement that they may even suggest that theamount of military help which these countries will receive from the United Stateswili depend on the degree to which they are able to satisfy the American view ofwhat may properly be expected of them by way of an increased effort.95 per cent, of the total defence effort of N.A.T.O. is. however, at present borne bythe United States, United Kingdom and France and it is an illusion to suppose thatthe contribution which the smaller countries could make towards closing the gapcould be very large in any circumstances. It is also implied in the Deputy^ state-ment that if the first United States objective is achieved, namely, the implementation of the Medium Term Plan by 1954, the United States Government expect Europethereafter to be able very quickly to dispense with any form of &quot; end-item &quot; aid andpossibly of economic aid from the United States and would themselves then makea considerable reduction in their own defence expenditure.46. There is every reason to suppose that most of the other N.A.T.O. Govern-ments will be strongly opposed to&quot; ideas of this character and that their mainendeavour at Ottawa will be to show that their defence efforts are already as large as economic and political circumstances allow. The Foreign Secretary and hiscolleagues, though they may agree that some of the smaller countries such asBelgium are being rather laggard, will wish wholeheartedly to associate themselvesin characterising the American approach as ill-timed and ill-conceived. In thefirst place they will wish to point out that it takes no account of the work uponwhich the economic organs of N.A.T.O. have been engaged for the past few months
and which is based on the fundamental concept that the burdens of defence mustbe equitably shared. The report of the Financial and Economic Board of N.A.T.O.will be likely to support our view that the programme to which the United kingdom is now committed may already be more than its fair share, that the United Statesprogramme, including foreign aid, massive though it is, may not be more than their fair share, and that France&apos;s programme, on paper at any rate, may at least be equal to its fair share. Secondly, the American approach overlooks the fact thatthere is anyway a gap between the equipment which will be produced under thepresent defence programmes of the N.A.T.O. countries and the equipment whichwould be necessary properly to fit out the forces which they have agreed to supply.Although the United Kingdom is undertaking a defence programme which HisMajesty&apos;s Government consider to be the maximum possible in present circum-stances, we shall none the less not be able out of our own resources to equip theforces which we intend to raise ourselves or have an obligation to equip and weare counting on supplies of equipment from the United States to fill or at leastnarrow this gap. Full equipment for the forces we intend to raise by 1954 would cost about  4,000 million so far as we have been able to calculate and we are onlyplanning to produce ourselves from  2,000 million pounds&apos; worth so that even allowing for stocks in hand the gap will be very large. For the current year,however, the indications are that we shall get only a very small amount of equip-ment from the United States. Before agreement is reached to try to fulfil the fullMedium-Term Defence Plan the forces which the N.A.T.O. countries have already undertaken to raise ought first to be properly equipped. In short, more UnitedStates aid is needed before existing programmes can be effectively executed let alone any expanded programmes. Finally, it would neither be equitable norpracticable for the N.A.T.O. countries other than the United States to maintain their forces out of their own resources after 1954 while the United States Govern-ment made a drastic reduction in their own expenditure on defence. Any attemptto arrange matters in this way would moreover result in such an increase in the disparity between American economic strength and that of Europe as would havea most disruptive effect on the alliance as a whole.IV. Conclusions47. The United Kingdom and France could only undertake larger defence programmes than those to which they are publicly committed if they were to go onto a basis of a full war economy. Apart from the economic and internal political consequences of such a policy as this the result might well be to make the Russiansfollow suit and so precipitate the war which it is the purpose of the N.A.T.O. toprevent. It would in fact only be justified if, for other reasons, it appeared likely that war was imminent. The Foreign Secretary will have to make this plain to the americans and he will, of course, have the strong support of M. Schuman. Theconclusion which he will wish to have drawn is that short of an imminent threat of war there are only two ways of closing the gap between existing programmes and the Medium-Term Defence Plan, namely, a large increase in the Americaneffort or a downward reassessment of the requirements of the Plan itself. if general Eisenhower supports the new American approach by asking for more fully equipped divisions to be stationed in Europe than existing plans contemplate, thebest way to meet his requirement would be for more American divisions nowstationed in the United States to be put under his command. The foreign secretary will also wish to join his colleagues in making the general points men-tioned in the preceding paragraph and so far as the United Kingdom in particularis concerned in laying special stress on the two points (o) that ^short of imminentwar our present defence effort is the most that we can contribute, and (b) that inorder to make it effective more American equipment will be needed than we appear on present form to be likely to receive.C.
