(51) 242 of our worsening balance of payments, and particularlydollar, position and of my intention to discuss these matters with the responsible American Ministers and also with representatives of theCommonwealth in Washington.    I was authorised by the Cabinet to informthe United States Administration fully of the worsening of our dollarsituation and to discuss possible remedies on the lines proposed in theCabinet discuss  on (C.M.(5l) 58th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. Accordingly, on my arrival in Washington I saw personally allthe mai n minister ers concerned and handed to them a copy of the memorandum which is attached at Annex I.   I stressed the top secret nature of thismemorandum and asked that it should be dealt with within as restricteda circle as possible in each Department.   It is in fact the case that therehave been no leaks on the American side.3. I thought it wise to follow up this initiative later by handing tothe same Ministers a memorandum setting out ways in whi ch the UnitedStates could assist us.    The copy of thi s memorandum is attached at annex II.4, The information contained in the first memorandum carne as aconsiderable shock to the American Ministers and at first there was aninclinat ion among the i r officials to argue that we were taking too possibility-mistic a view and were not di s counting sufficiently the temporary factors.I was able, however, to dispel these doubts and I think it was quite clearthat at the end of my visit the Americans were in no doubt about the seriousness of the situation.   It is, however, not possible for me toreport any definite agreement with the Americans about action whichmight be taken.    The main object of providing these two memoranda to the americans was to ensure that the Agencies and Ministers principally concerned should know of the position before they started to draw up their proposals for their next Mutual Security legislation.   This objective hasbeen achieved and our representatives in Washington will enter into dis-cussions on the details of the second memorandum with the Americans assoon as possible.   While I cannot give any forecast of what line the americans are likely to take I can say that our position is now fully understood and^ill be considered with sympathy and understanding,-1-
5. I al so took the opportunity to explain the position to representatives of the Commonwealth in Washington.    Copies of thefirst memorandum have been sent to Commonwealth Governments throughordinary channels, and I told representatives of the Commonwealth in washington that we contemplated having a meeting of the commonwealth countries at the official level about mid-November to consider the actionwhich we should take on a joint basis to deal with the position.   Iamproposing to go ahead with the arrangements for this meeting of officials,and a telegram will be sent accordingly in the near future.WAIVER OF INTEREST ON UNITED STATES/CANADIAN LOANS6. I propose to make an oral report to my colleagues on thi s matter.DEFENCE7. My second obj ectivs in Washington was to bring some sense ofeconomic reality into the discussions due to take place in Ottawa on the size of the defence programmes of the North Atlantic Treaty powers.The American intention clearly was to use the Ottawa Conference as anopportunity to press the European members to increase thei r programmesstill further on the ground that in total they fell short of the requirementsof the Medium-Term Defence Plan, and still more of the recently formulatedrequirements of General Eisenhower.    It was clear that  in the circum-stances in which we found our selves, thi s was completely unrealisticand the result of the two parts of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,the military and the economic, proceeding on parallel lines without properconsul tat i on with each other;   what seemed to me to be required was a means of confronting those responsible for the military requi rements withthose of us who were aware of the economic possibilities and limitations,8. When the Foreign Secretary reached Washingt on from san francisco I discussed the matter with him, urging that it should be added tothe agenda for his tripartite conversations with Mr, Acheson andM, Schuman, in order that a common line of policy might be evolvedbetween the Americans, French and ourselves before we went to Ottawa,A tripartite meeting was accordingly arranged at which I set out ourposition, and M. Mayer explained that the position of France was roughlyparallel to our own.    He went on to propose the setting up of an ad hocgroup of four &quot;wise men&quot; to analyse the problem and make recommendations to the Governments,    Mr. Acheson was obviously impressed with the seriousness of the position and it was agreed to give further thought to theFrench proposal.9, Soon after we reached Ottawa I had further di scus si on withMr.   Foster and M. Mayer, as a result of which we securdd agreement to the fol lowing(a) Since the problem was not merely a technical one, those appointedto deal with it should be either members of, or at least in the closest touch with, their Governments;(b) Ideally the group should consist of representatives of the three major powers only, but some arrangement would have to be madeto associate the smaller powers with its work.(c) The arrangement would be ad hoc and temporary in character,so as not to supersede the regular agencies of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation, and so that the findings might be arrived at in time for the next submission to Congress,
10. Proposals on these lines were accordingly introduced into theCouncil, and after some difficulty over the size of the group, theCouncil adopted the resolution which is reproduced as Annex III.It will be noticed that the resolution describes the new body as a temporarycommittee of the Council, and that it is required to report its findingsto the Council not later than 1st December, 1951.     At the same time anunderst anding was reached that the Chai rman woul d be the Americanrepresentative (who will almost certainly be Ivlr. Harriman) and that theBritish and French representatives would be the Vice-Chai rman, who withthe Chai rman will form the Executive Bureau.

ANNEX united KING-DOM BALAMCE OF PAYMENTS POSIT IONA.    The Gold and Dollar Accounts1. At the present moment the gold and dollar balance ofpayments of the Sterling Area is deteriorating rapidly.      Inthe first quarter of 1951 there v/as a surplus of $360 million,which fell to $5h million in the second quarter.      thereafter the balance moved into heavy deficit, and this has tended to accelerate.      Figures since the beginning of the year are asfollows:-Sterling Area Gold and Dollar BalancemillionJanuary - March (monthly average)	/ 120April	/   59May	/    1June	-     pJuly	- 137August	- 2112. In the first two months of the present quarter,therefore, the deficit has amounted to nearly $350 million.There may be some improvement in September because of the non-recurrence of certain special items.      But the quarterly figureas a whole is likely to approximate to a deficit of  500million.     As receipts under E, R. P.  are now very small, *prac-tically the whole of this deficit will have to be met from the reserves, which will, therefore, fall by about I2fb in a singlequarter (from $3,867 million to approximately $3,1+00 million).3* Though some of the factors responsible for the heavythird quarter deficit will not recur in the fourth, and though there may be some seasonal improvement as well, the fourthquarter is likely to continue to show a considerable deficit,probably of the order of $300 million.    This would imply a deficit of some $775 million in the second half of^this yearand a loss of reserves in six months approaching $4 billion or about 20% of the reserves at the end of June.h. The main factors responsible for this rapid change inthe position are considered in greater detail below.      It isclear from the movements which have taken place or are in prospect that we face an altogether different position from thatwhich was envisaged by the United Kingdom in its submission tothe Financial and Economic Board of N. A. T. 0, in connection withthe investigation into the problems of sharing the burdens ofthe defence programme.      It is equally clear that the situationis radically worse than that envisaged in the estimates andcalculations of the United States Administration in its ownsubmission to Congress in connection with discussions on the mutual Security Bill.     A comparison of the latest, verytentative, united Kingdom estimates of the Sterling Area&apos;s gold and dollar balance of payments in 1951/52, with the earlierestimates made last April in the submission to N.A.T. 0. , andwith the official estimates of the United States Administration
are shown in the table below.      In addition, this contains avery schematic projection of the gold and dollar accounts tocover the calendar year 1952,     Finally, details of the actualoutcome in the year 1950 are given, against which all theseprojections may be compared.Sterling Area Gold and Dollar AccountsComparison of Forward Projections andof these with results in 1950$ million	1950	1951/52			1952	Actual	Latest U.

After allowing for the fact thatdollar assistance amounting to some $f billion was received in1950, against only $100 million expected in 1951/52, thedifference in the movement of the gold and dollar reserves is approximately $2-f billion;   that is, an expected loss of $1.1biilion compared with a gain in 1950 of over $1.6 billion.This loss is equivalent to some 30% of total reserves at 30thJune, 1951.     Moreover, a most disturbing feature of thesituation is the fact that so far as can be seen the outlook for1952 as a whole is not significantly better and a loss of reserves during the year of the order of $1 billion appears tobe in prospect. -2-
6- Although the position in recent weeks has been affected by certain temporary and seasonal factors, the major part of the deterioration in 1951/52 compared with 1950 whichis illustrated in the table above is attributable to signifi-cant underlying influences. Eight major factors can be dis-distinguished as responsible; these are dealt with briefly inthe paragraphs which follow.7* The first factor is the increase in. United Kingdomexpenditure on imports from the dollar area.     Compared with1950, the import programme for 1951/52 shows a rise of over$900 million.      Of this, stockpiling purchases and defencemachine tools account for some $300 million.      Of the remaining$600 million, the rise in prices of dollar imports (which isexpected to amount to 26% compared with average 1950) accounts for 6k% and the increase in volume of imports for the remaining36^0.     The actual volume of dollar imports programmed (apartfrom stockpiling and defence tools) is estimated at 18% above1950 (mainly wheat and flour, tobacco, timber, wood pulp,cotton and non-ferrous metals).     This programme is the absolute minimum required to meet essential needs for food-stuffs, and to provide the raw materials on which productionand the defence programme itself depend.8. The second factor is the halt to the rise in thevolume of United Kingdom exports to the dollar area.     Exportsof raw materials and semi-manufactured goods have already&quot;hadto be restricted because of shortages.      Other exports, e. g.vehicles and textiles, have been affected by weakening demand.Though actual receipts from exports are expected to rise by$250-300 million compared with 1950, this is primarily theresult of higher prices.     Increased earnings from exports will thus meet less than a third of the extra cost of United Kingdomdollar imports.9* The third factor   is the effect of the Persian crisisandjjbhe_serious worsening of our dollar invisibles account.Replacement from dollar sources of the loss of Persiansupplies is estimated to cost over $300 million per annum.Though there will bo some saving on expenditure in Persia, thenet cost in dollars may well be between $200-300 million a year.Compared with.1950 this is the manor change in the dollarinvisibles account.10. The fourth factor is the beginning of debt service onthe U. S.  and Canadian credits.      This will cost some $174million per annum, beginning at the end of 1951.      The samefigure has been allowed in 1952.      (See Appendix A for details.)11. The fifth factor is the big reduction in dollar capita?inflow, mainlynn short term account, from the high level reached in 1950*      This inflow was partly speculative in character andnecessarily temporary.     nevertheless it was an important factor in inflating the gold and dollar surplus and the reserves in 1950 and its non-recurrence worsens the finalresult in 1951/52 by some $200-300 million.12. The sixth factor is the rise in dollar spending bythe Rest of the Sterling Area countries, out stripping theincrease in their dollar earnings.     Compared with 1950, expen-diture in the first half of 1951 by Rest of Sterling area countries increased by about 50$.     This is a trend which maybe expected to continue.      The estimates for 1951/52, in fact,imply an aggregate expenditure on imports from the dollar area(excluding Indian imports financed through the Grain Credit)amounting to approximately $1,200 million compared with$650 million in 1950.     The influences behind this increase aresimilar to those affecting the United Kingdom;    that is, higher
prices, and increased requirements for stockpiling, expandingproduction, and in replacement of supplies which cannot hoobtained elsewhere.      There are as yet no signs that this increase is slowing up, though difficulties in procuringsupplies from North America may be growing.     Though earnings are expected to be greater in 1951/52 than in 1950 the totaldollar surplus of the Rest of the Sterling Area is estimatedat nearly $300 million less, primarily as a result of the risein dollar expenditure.      (Further details of the balance ofpayments of the Rest of Sterling Area with the dollar area aregiven in Appendix B. )13* The seventh factor is the sham deterioration in theUnited Kingdom -position vis-a-vis other 0. E. E. c. countries., in1950 the U.K. not surplus in the Tnt r a-lur ope an Payments Agree-racnt and the European Payments Union amounted to  273 million.In the first quarter of this year the surplus was still large - 55 million.     Since then there has been a rapid worsening ofthe positionj   the monthly figures have been as followsUnited Kingdom Net Surplus and Deficit in E. P. U.  millionApril...................,. /   16May.....................  -   10June.....................  -   18July   .....................  -   k3   &apos;August.....................  -    6714. The factors responsible for this deterioration have much in common with those which have been influencing the dollar situation.      In particular, there has been a rapid increase in United Kingdom imports, under the influence of higher prices and the measures of liberalisation which havebeen taken.      In the second quarter of 1951 imports at about 2^0 million were over 70^0 above the quarterly average in 1950.An even greater increase has taken place in expenditure by theRest of the Sterling Area.      It is true that Sterling Areaearnings, in particular from sales of the major raw materialsproduced in the Rest of the Sterling Area, also increasedrapidly towards the end of 1950 and remained at a high leveluntil the middle of this year.     But the fall in prices inrecent months will bite very severely into future earnings, while there is at present no sign that the upward trend in expenditure has been halted.      In these circumstances a very substantialdeficit in E. P.U.  in 1951-52, of a minimum of  250 million,becomes a distinct possibility.     Even this figure implies thatthe present increase in expenditure will tend to slacken, andpresupposes no further reduction in Rest of Sterling Area export-prices.      In unfavourable circumstances the deficit might riseby between  100-200 million more.      By the end of this month itis expected that the United Kingdom will have exhausted itscredit balance in E. P.U.  and will have repaid the  h3 million ingold and dollars drawn in 1950-51*      Thereafter the deficit willbe met for a time by credit advanced by E. P. U.     But the pros-pective deficit is so large that further payments in gold and dollars will almost certainly become necessary later in the year..The estimates, in the table in paragraph h above, allow for anotional loss of $50 million in the two halves of 1952, follow-ing the loss of $106 million in the present quarter of 1951.Clearly in some circumstances this loss might be substantiallyexceeded.
15. The eighth factor1 is the increase in prospective gold and dollar losses to non-dollar countries as a result of the weakening of the United Kingdom&apos;s overall balance of payments.In 1950 and early this year a scarcity of sterling resulted insubstantial purchases against dollars (e, g. by Brazil, Japanetc.).     These were large enough to offset the &quot;normal&quot; gold and dollar losses to countries such as Persia and the NetherlandsWest Indies in connection with the operations of the oil pro-ducing companies.     The earlier purchases have now been largelysold back again, and the increasing availability of sterlingresulting from the deterioration in our overall balance hasgreatly enhanced the risk that dollar settlements v/ith variousnon-sterling area countries will have to be made to meet current balance of payments deficits.      In particular, the Sterling Areaposition vis-a-vis Argentina, Finland and Eastern european countries generally is likely to be extremely difficult and mayeither involve dollar payment, or a risk to essential supplies,or the need to replace thorn from dollar sources.      In theestimates above a general allowance has been made for the expected dollar losses in connection with these countries,amounting to some $100 million in 1951-52 and in 1952.(Details of these gold and dollar transactions with non-dollar countries are shown in Appendix C. )Comparison between present estimates for 19,51/52 and theearlier United Kingdom estimates submitted to N. A. T.O.,16. Compared with the situation envisaged in April, 1951,when the estimates for N. A. T. 0. were compiled, the presentcalculations show a deterioration in the gold and dollarbalance of over $1 billion, and a loss of reserves of $1.1billion, against a hoped for gain of some $150 million - a difference of about $1^ billion in the size of the reserves.17- Some of the factors responsible for this worsened,position have been mentioned above in the comparison between1951-52 estimates and actual results in 1950, e. g. the loss of persian oil, and the sharp deterioration in the U. K. positionin E. p. U. , as well as with a number of other non-sterling area countries.     But the most important single factor in the changedoutlook is the fall in prices of the manor commodity exports from the Rest of the Sterling Area and the reduction in demandfor wool, rubber and tin.      Compared with prices in the middleof February, on which the estimates for IT.A.T.0, were based,current prices have fallen by the following amounts;: -Wool (crossbred)....... .. 50%Tin. eoo. ....&apos;....:...&apos;*. 1. h5/oRubber................... 30J&quot;$Cocoa. ....... ............ 9^oThese four commodities alone account for about 60% of the totalearnings from exports of the Rest of the Sterling Area.      It isdifficult to- estimate what the decline in prices so far means in terms of aggregate dollar earnings, but provisional calcu-lations suggest that receipts by the Rest of the Sterling area will be almost $250 million or nearly 25% less in the second half of 1951 than in the first half.     Compared with theestimates in the N.A.T. 0.  submission, the reduction in 1951-52is of about $hOO million.     Included in this figure is some allowance for a decline in expected demand for wool, rubber and tin, particularly for stockpiling purposes, compared withearlier views.
18. Other differences of less importance are (a) in theestimate for U, K.  exports, where a rather more optimistic v^ewis now taken of the prospect of dollar earnings (plus $160million);    and (b) in the estimate for M. D.A.  receipts, wherethe original United Kingdom forecast included an allowance of$250 million for the estimated dollar cost of the additionaldefence programme, while the current estimates include a sumof only $60 million in respect of defence machine tools.     Thetwo differences are largely offsetting.Conrparison between the United Kingdom and official UnitedStates estlmates19* Most of the conclusions which emerge from the examin-ation of the United Kingdom estimates apply with equal or even greater force to the official United States estimates of theprobable position of the sterling area dollar accounts in1951/52.      In particular, tbe following points should benoted:(a) The deficit on invisible account does not allowsufficiently for the loss of Persian oil.(b) The R. S. A.  and capital surplus is not dissimilarfrom the original U.K.  estimate for IT. A.T. 0.  andis thus very much over-stated,(c) A large E. p. U.  surplus is forecast, whereas therewill have been losses of $106 million in the currentquarter alone, and there may be further losses later in the year.20,    General conclusion on the position of the reservesOn the basis of the estimates put forward in this note, the United Kingdom&apos;s reserves, which will amount to approximately $3,100 million at the end of 1951, may fall to&apos;little over $2,000 million at the end of 1952.     This will bring them, in absolute terms, back to little more than thelevel reached at the end of March, 1950.      In terms of purchasing power, however, that is, after allowing for the rise in import prices which the United Kingdom must pay, amounting tosome 60% over the past two years, reserves of $2,000 million will be no more than they wore at the lowest point reachedsince the end of the war.B*    The Overall Balance of payments* In 1950 the United Kingdom earned a surplus in itsoverall balance of paymencs of  229 million.     In the second half of 1950 the surplus was running at the rate of  366million a year.     Only very provisional estimates are availableso far for this year;    these show that the surplus has givenway to a deficit of approximately  100 million in the first sixmonths, equivalent to a rate of  200 million a year andinvolving a deterioration within six months of  500-600 million per annum.2. Moreover, the rate at which the deficit is currentlyrunning is such that in the second half of 1951 a big increaseeven over the large first half-year&apos;s deficit is virtuallyinevitable.     The rise in import prices has recently been checked, while the continued (though slow) increase in export prices has continued.      It is reasonable, therefore, to expect that the current alarming deficit will tend to diminish.     Butthe volume of imports required to support increased production
will increase;    above all our export trade faces extremedifficulties in expanding beyond current levels as a resultof shortages of raw materials and the diversion of capacity to defence production, particularly in the metal-using industries, which have provided half our exports in the recentpast,3* In these circumstances, and as long as import pricesremain at approximately present levels a large deficit in the overall balance of payments appears inevitable.      The table below shows the probable picture in 1951/32, together with a tentative projection for the year 1952.     The essential factorson which these calculations for 1951/52 are based are asfollows:-(i)    Imports (excluding stockpilingand defence equipment):increase over 1950: approx.  10% in volume,costing / 300 million at 1 951/52 prices35-ho;;b in averagevalues costing/ 900 million(i:L)   Exports; increase over 1950:     Volume by only 1-2%Average value by25-30&apos;b(iii)    Invisibles:    Compared with 1950 there is only a smallnet&apos; decline in net earnings on invisible account inspite of necessary allowance for the effect of theloss of Persian oil and the need for replacing it from dollar sources.     The assumption is that thisreplacement can in fact be made.     A serious declinein United Kingdom sales to overseas markets would,have a catastrophic effect on the balance of pay-ments with a large number of countries, even though there might be some saving on dollar expenditure.United Kingdom Balance of Payments  million	1950	1951		TT52  1	951/52	1952	Year	1st half	2nd half	1st half	Year	YearImports (incl. stockpiling)	2,374	1,650	1 ,800	1,800	3,600	3* 60CExports (f. o.b.)	2,221	1,310	1 ,390	1,510	2,900	3,000Invisibles(net)	/ 382	/ 240	/ 150	/ 200	/ 350	/ 350Current balance	/ 229	- 100	- 260	-   90	- 350	- 25cExports and re-exports required to achieve current, balance (apart from stockpil-ing) (approx.)		1 ,400	1 ,600	1,550	3,150	3,250
*  mh. Compared with the United Kingdom submission to. A.T. 0.  in April this year the present estimates show   anincrease in the expected deficit in 1951/52 of  250 million.( 350 million compared with  100 million. )     This differencecan be explained as follows(i)   Bigger expenditure on imports,mainly through higher prices - 150(ii)   Small net invisible earnings,including smaller receipts through a. M. P. which had been reckoned at 90 million and are now reckoned at about  20 million - 170(iii)    Offset by increased export earnings,entirely through, higher prices /   70Total change in estimated deficit - 2505- The extremely tentative forecasts outlined abovesuggest that during 1951 and 1952 the United kingdom s overallbalance will be running a deficit of some  300 million a year with no appreciable trend towards improvement over the period.Even this conclusion, however, is dependent on the assumptionthat import prices show no further rise on present levels, andthat the relief from the recent falls will be fully secured.It need hardly be said that a further significant increaseresulting from the resumption of world inflationary pressure would have a most serious effect on the United Kingdom balanceof payments.     A further point which must be emphasised is theextreme uncertainty as to the possibility of achieving eventhe level of total exports postulated in the present forecasts.The impact of growing defence production has only just begun tomake itself significantly felt on the engineering industry;there is an acute scarcity of steel in prospect;    and the scope for expansion of exports of consumers goods in place of the rawmaterials, semi-manufactures, and many classes of metal productswhose export is bound to be reduced has definite limits.     Everyeffort must and will be made to secure this expansion, but thedifficulties are formidable.      In any case an increase in export earnings sufficient to achieve a balance in the United Kingdom&apos;external accounts is, given the present and prospective levelof import costs, beyond the range of likely possibility.6.

&quot;    12ftANNEX II1. V7e have furnished to the interested U.S.  agenciesa memorandum on the balance of payments of the United Kingdomand the sterling area.   The estimates for 1951/52 in thememorandum are provisional and the projection throughout1952 is hazardous.    &apos;.7e are, however, proceeding v/ith furtheranalysis and refinement of the figures.   Despite theirlimitations the forecasts clearly disclose a balance ofpayments situation which will put in jeopardy our economic stability and therefore our defence programme unless actionto check these dangerous movements is speedily taken.    Inputting the dollar deficit of the sterling area at$1,100 million in 1952, we have in our view fully discountedtemporary factors and exceptional payments.    The difficultiesnow confronting us are likely to be prolonged, even as theburden of defence itself.   The solution of this problem is ajoint interest and calls for action by both the U.S. and theUnited Kingdom.2- Y.&quot;e shall, of course, do everything within our power andin concert with the other members of the sterling area toreduce the pressure on our balance of payments by increasing exports and reducing imports.    The latterexpedient is, we recognise,  not a satisfactory course.Further, it should be realised that the room for manoeuvrehere is not great.    Appendix I shows that there is littlescope for reductions in the level of consumption and stockspostulated in the balance of payments memorandum^3* Fundamental damage would be done to our economy9 our production and our defence effort, if we tried to close thebalance of payments gaps solely by our own efforts, i.e. by restricting imports and increasing exports at the expense ofdefence and essential investments.    Even if the action takenby all sides is both effective and immediate the reserves ofthe sterling area will nevertheless be considerably reducedbefore such action can have its impact.    Our objective mustbe first to reduce very substantially the rate of declineand then as soon as possible to stabilise the position.7/e must aim at measures adequate when in full operation,to close as soon as possible the gap of $1,000 million or so, without lasting damage.    77e believe that by actionswhich we and the R.S.A. can take we can fill at best halfthis gap.3.    (a)     T/e shall be approaching the U.S. Government aboutfilling by end-item aid the equipment deficiencies in ourpresent defence programme.    The amount involved is between 1.5and 2 billion pounds.   The provision of this end-item aidwill greatly strengthen our ability to play our part in theN.A.T.0. defence but will not of itself help in thesolution of the problems set out above.   V.re have, therefore,considered measures which the U.S. Government might take inorder to help to fill the gap.    There are two measures whichare necessary in order to prevent our economic position asset out in our memorandum on the balance of payments, fromdeteriorating even further .   These are set out in paragraphsk and 5*    The measures set out in the succeeding paragraphswould make a positive contribution to improving the position.Y/e realise, however, that changes in legislation may berequired to carry them out.    This emphasises the necessityfor immediate action in fields not requiring new legislation.-1-
13ftk&apos; Steel. In a separate note (Appendix II) we show that without an import of 800,000 tons of steel from U.S.A., thegeneral balance of payments deficit in our memorandum wouldbe increased by at least  165 million.5.      Imports from the Sterling Area.    In the table on page 3 ofour memorandum, we have already assumed large U.S. purchases of wool, tin and rubber at reasonable prices, i.e, woolsales of $258 million, rubber net $280 million, tin $115 million.Insofar as our dollar earnings from these exports to U.S. aresmaller because of reduction in volume or price, the dollarpicture presented in the memorandum will be worsened.    Themost important contribution, which the U*S. agencies can make here, would be to maintain a steady buying policy and by long-term contract or otherwise, to provide a reasonablestability of prices, whether in ordinary purchases or inpurchases for stockpilings    It should be emphasised that theforegoing would be required merely to prevent the position from being no worse than that painted in our memorandum, andwe would wish in discussions to verify that the assumptionson which our figures are based are in fact not over-optimistic.The U.S. could also help by removing restrictions in U.S.consumption of these sterling area commodities.   A positivecontribution towards closing the dollar gap would be made ifthe U.S. would increase the volume of its imports of suchR.S.A. commodities as are readily available at reasonable   -prices for stockpiling.6.      Off-shore Purchases from United Kingdom Production.This could be the most efficient single method which U.S.might adopt to help us since the amounts involved are potentiallyvery large.    Significant assistance could be afforded to our balance of payments if the U.S. were to purchase for dollarssome of the products inside the  2 billion production element in our defence programme and would firmly guarantee that these products would be turned over to the United Kingdom.    In orderthat timely relief may be accorded to our balance of paymentsit would be necessary for some of the orders alreadyplaced in the United Kingdom (these amount to about 1,000 million out of the total of  2,000 million) to betaken over under the off-shore purchase procedure mentionedabove.    We suggest immediate study of the techniques and theamount of relief which can be obtained in this way for our balance of payments and for the preservation of our defence programme.    If such off-shore purchases were related to production beyond the  2 billion production element in ourcurrent defence programme, this would involve further-diversion of industrial capacity to defence.    Such diversionwould in no way improve our general balance of payments position;    in fact it would lead inevitably to the same difficulties with which we were faced immediately after thelast war.7*     Additional end-item assistance from U.S. production,.This could be in relief of our existing defence production.The provision of additional end-item assistance in reductionof the  2 billion production element in our existing defence production programme could release part of our engineering industries to increase the volume of exports which arerequired if we are to attain the external balance essentialto our defence programme.Off-shore Purchases by U.S.  in Europe for the UnitedKingdom Defence Programme.     We have already placed in Europeorders for finished equipment and machine tools to a value of 1+0 million for our U,7 defence programme.   Our targetexpenditure in this sector was  50 million per annum, andsubject to satisfactory financial arrangements there would
no doubt be additional orders beyond the  ho million mentionedabove.   Our general and dollar balance of payments could be improved if the U.S. were willing to take over these Europeanorders already placed and others that may with their agreementbe placed and turn the goods over to the United kingdom for its defence programme.    If this procedure is accepted in principle, v/e suggest that examination of amounts andtechnique should proceed immediately.   We would requirearrangements to ensure that the goods would be reserved forthe United Kingdom defence programme.9.      Cost of Works Services for U.S. Forces in theUnited Kingdom.     The United Kingdom has agreed to pay 50^of the cost of certain specified projects in theUnited Kingdom for the U.S. Air Force and a rather higher proportion of the cost of the &quot;Oxfordshire&quot; airfields.Execution of these projects is spread over the period1950/51 to 1953/h.    The latest estimate of the total cost ofthis programme is  h5 million of which, under existing arrangements, about one-half would fall upon theUnited Kingdom.    Further projects of this kind estimated to cost a further  1+0 million are believed to be in conterapla-tion.    If the U.S. would pay the whole capital cost ofthese projects and subsequent maintenance costs v/e would thereby receive an immediate and continuing alleviation of our dollar problem.    Such payments could presumably be made outof existing U.S. defence appropriations and would not now orhereafter create a demand on mutual security funds,10.     Stock-piling.      Stockpiling of essential and bulkycommodities on an adequate scale must form an integral partof any defence plan.    The dollar component of ourstockpiling programme in 1951/52 is $175 million and ouroverall imports for stockpiling in 195l/2 will be about 100 million.    This is part of a 3-year stockpiling programme at present planned.    Any reduction in it would not onlyseriously weaken our defence but would embarrass us and our allies in time of war by adding substantially to shipping difficulties.    It is therefore suggested that the U.S. might consider financingihe food and raw material stockpilingprogramme of the United Kingdom.11.     Extension of Scone of Mutual Security Aid.    The disappear-ance of the A.M.P. procedure must, given the present balance ofpayments difficulties, reduce the ability of N.A.T.O. powersto carry out their defence programmes.    The restoration of this procedure or greater flexibility in the military assistanceprogramme (e.g. through a more flexible definition of end-item) would provide the possibility of financing the supply of dollar raw materials essential for defence production orother items of direct significance in the defence programme.Particular examples are steel, oil and machine tools.12.     Oil.      Our military forces were, during the first halfof 1951, consuming oil at an annual rate of $60 million worth.In the light of the Persian situation and the scale of our purchases of dollar oil, we suggest for consideration thepossibility of U.S. providing equivalent aid.   Relief ofthis kind could be made coterminous with the dollar lossoccasioned by the Persian affair.13. V/e would wish as a matter of urgency to pursue cftscussionsof the suggestions in the foregoing paragraphs with theappropriate agencies of the U.S. Government.
APPENDIX II.STEELThe balance of payments estimates for 1951/52 andfor the calendar year 1952 v/hich have already been circulated,assume that the United Kingdom will at least be able tomaintain through 1952 a volume of exports of engineering products in the widest sense (i.e, including broadly allproducts of the metal-using industries) equal to that in1950,    This will not be possible in 1952 unless totalengineering output in that year is about 10$o above that in1950 by volume.   This volume of engineering output in the wide sense used above cannot be achieved without steelsupplies of 800,000 tons from the United States in additionto anticipated home production and other imports.Over 1950 United Kingdom total stocks fell by 15^.In the first half of 1951 raw material stocks, includingGovernment stockpiles, fell by a further Ityo and food by 13^.It is conceivable that some of these reductions arecounter-balanced by some increase in the stocks in the handsof manufacturers and retailers, but v/e have not been able toobtain any direct evidence of this.    In the light of these movements, the volume of imports provided in the 1951/52programme appears modest.    In 1950 the decline in stocks of imported goods was equivalent to 6&apos;/0 of total imports.   Anincrease of 6^0 was thus required simply to maintainconsumption of imported commodities at the 1950 level.    Inaddition the 1951/52 programme provides for a 5?q net increasein commercial stocks of imported commodities.    This, however,would do no more than bring them back to the end of 1950level which was inadequate for efficient operation anddistribution.    In view of the recent trend of importedstocks, it seems unlikely that the programme of imports would in fact be sufficient to achieve this,V/e do not know a great deal about the level of stocks in the R,S.A. but we have no reason to believe that they areunusually high.The United Kingdom 1951/52 programme provides forconsumption of imported food at the 1950 level only andinvolves a fall in the consumption of meat, eggs and tea.The recent reductions in the ration of sugar and cheesewill also bring the consumption of these below the 1950 level.Although consumption did rise sharply in 1950,  the level of consumption in the first half of 1951 was actually about 2L/oless than the average for 1950,As far as raw materials are concerned, our import programme postulates no further depletion of stocks, but a modest restoration, including provision to deal with increasedindustrial production of about h/o over 1950,Our total investment programme is no bigger than in1950;    it includes, however, a much larger defence componentand hence implies a substantial reduction in civil investment.To sum up, we are not programming for increased consumption or increased investment compared with 1950,   Theincrease in commercial stocks is very modest and in the main,our increased production, for which additional inports arerequired, is being devoted primarily to defence.
2S In 1950 the United Kingdom gross output of metal goodswas valued at  2,350 million.    Of this defence took I65 million and exports  900 million, leaving  1,235 million for home civil use.   In 1952 defence will require  500 million(at 1950 prices), i.e.  335 million more than in 1950.Assuming that the volume of exports is at the same figureas in 1950 and that total output is increased by  235 millionhome civil use will have to be reduced by  100 million.    Itshould be emphasised that the mainten nee of exports at this level will not ensure equilibrium in our balance of paymentsbut will only suffice to hold the deficit at the figureindicated in the estimates already circulated.    If the grossoutput of metal goods cannot be increased in 1952, thebalance of payments position will be so much the worse.5* The 1952 requirements of steel for purposes other thandirect export are estimated at 11.3 million tons against whichwe should have, if the proposed imports from the U.S. arenot secured, supplies of only 10.5 million tons.   We must provide as a matter of priority, for increased requirements ofcertain basic industries (coal, electricity and transport),whose expansion is vital to industrial production as a whole,e.g. the coal industry will need 70,000 tons more in 1952 thanin 1950.   After allowing for these needs,  it is estimated thatthe amounts available for the metal-using industries on thebasis of a total supply of only 10.5 million tons will be soreduced that their output will fall by at least 2/o instead ofincreasing by 10/o as projected;    and the amount of dislocationmight be much greater,h. If the output of metal-using industry were 2;.o less thanin 1950, supplies of metal goods for export and home civil use,i.e., after deducting defence needs as estimated in paragraph 2,would be, not  100 million, as forecast there, but really 1+00 million less than in 19500    It would not be possible todeduct this wholly from home consumption, which of courseincludes a large proportion for industrial investment of allkinds.   This has been under continuous restriction since thewar through direct controls and the influence of taxation andthese controls have now been restored to their full rigour.    Itwould be dangerous to reduce the investment programme much belowthe level now planned.   Exports would therefore have to take some part of the cuts and even if the fall in exports were limited to a third of the total short-fall, the cost to the overall balance of payments would be  130 million at 1950 prices,or  160 million at 1952 forecast prices.    The figure might wellbe higher.5. Thus if our requested imports of 800,000 tons ofsteel from the U.S. are not obtained, the United Kingdomoverall balance of payments in 1952 will worsen by at least 160 million compared with the estimates already circulated,A large part of this -would be reflected in our dollar deficit which would similarly also be substantially increased.There would be danger of grave dislocation of the defence programme,6, It should be noted that the cost of the suggestedimports of steel (estimated at  85,000,000) was by over-sight omitted from the balance of payments calculations ascirculated.
