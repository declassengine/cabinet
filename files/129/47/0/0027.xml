annex draft OF THE kings SPEECH ON THE PROROGATION OFPARLIAMENT, 1950-51 session my Lords and Members of the House of Commons :My Government, in association with the other Governments signatory to theNorth Atlantic Treaty, having accepted the necessity for making greatly increased provision for defence, the consequent strengthening of My Forces is alreadybecoming apparent. I pray that, with God&apos;s help, the defence programme will succeed in its purpose of averting war and laying the foundations of a lasting peacethroughout the world.My Government have watched with sympathy and interest the progress madein building up, within the wider framework of the North Atlantic partnership, a european community in which Germany will play her part. My Government desireto establish the closest possible association with this community at all stages in its development.I welcome the appointment of General of the Army Eisenhower as supreme allied Commander, Europe. Units of My Forces have been placed under his command.In order to increase the readiness of our defences, reservists of My forces have been recalled for periods of training of between fifteen days and three months,and for periods of service amounting in some cases to eighteen months.My Ministers have continued to give the fullest support to the United nations in the maintenance of international peace and security.It is My earnest hope that the efforts which are being made to restore peace in Korea will be successful. Under the United Nations My Forces have continuedto take a prominent part in the arduous campaign in that country. The land forces from the various Commonwealth countries have been grouped together to formthe First (Commonwealth) Division. The heroic action of the First Battalion, theGloucester Regiment, maintained the highest traditions of My fighting services andhas been justly acclaimed throughout the world.My Government deeply regret that, although they made earnest efforts to finda basis for discussion, success did not attend the recent negotiations for a meetingof the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, France, the United States and theUnited Kingdom.My Ministers have tried to achieve by negotiation a solution of the unfortunatedispute which has arisen in connection with the oil industry in Iran, but these efforts,despite the help rendered by the special representative of the President of theUnited States, have so far been unsuccessful.Together with the United States Government, My Government jointlysponsored the Treaty of Peace with Japan which was signed at San Francisco, onthe 8th September, by forty-eight nations. The Treaty was the result of a prolongedseries of international consultations in which My Government in the UnitedKingdom and My Governments in other Commonwealth countries had played a leading part.In Malaya progress has been made in associating all communities with theadministration of Government and in furthering their welfare and prosperity.With the assistance of the peoples of Malaya and the civil administration, Mytroops have, with increasing success, continued their efforts to restore law and order and to bring communist banditry to an end.The Prime Ministers, or their representatives, from all the self-governingcountries of the Commonwealth met in London in January last to review theinternational situation and to consider what further positive action commonwealth governments could take to secure and preserve world peace. Since then, ministers from the United. Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and SouthernRhodesia met in London to consider defence problems in regions of common concern, including the Middle East, and South African Ministers met with repre-sentatives of other interested Governments in Nairobi to consider defence facilities in Africa.41256
The increase in production, which has been among the outstanding achieve-ments of this country since the war, has continued in the face of many difficulties.For this success great credit is due to workpeople and management throughout thewhole range of industry, agriculture and commerce. Despite the obstacles causedby shortages of materials and the high prices of many imports, full employment hasbeen maintained, our exports have continued at a high level and the rearmament programme has been further advanced.During the past session My Ministers were able to announce that, in agreementwith the United States Government, it had been decided to suspend further allot-ments of Marshall Aid for which we owe a debt of gratitude to the people of theUnited States.In order to restrain the rise in living costs provoked by high import prices,measures have been taken, by the operation of price control and otherwise, to limit the rise in the prices of goods and services made inevitable by advances in basiccommodity prices, wages and other costs.I regret that the balance of payments, which was remarkably favourable lastyear has, largely because of higher import prices, become less favourable in recent months.It gave me great pleasure to open in May last the Festival of Britain, in whichthe whole nation has displayed its talents and traditions in the arts and sciences.Despite the clouds which hang over the world, the celebrations throughout theland have been given a powerful stimulus to the arts of peace and have providedopportunity for well-earned recreation of spirit.I am pleased that so many visitors from overseas have attended the Festival,which has thus contributed to international friendship and understanding.I warmly welcomed the State visits of Her Majesty The Queen of theNetherlands and His Royal Highness Prince Bernhardt of the Netherlands, TheirMajesties, The King and Queen of Denmark and His Majesty, The King of Norway.My Ministers continue to attach importance to international co-operation and mutual aid in economic and social matters through the United Nations and other bodies. They were glad to welcome delegates from Commonwealth and foreigncountries to the tariff negotiations which were- held last winter in Torquay, and toparticipate with other Commonwealth Governments in the plans for the economic development of South and South-East Asia. My Government continue to collaborate fully in the work of the Organisation for European economic co-operation.My Ministers were glad to be able to exchange views at a meeting in london with Ministers in other Commonwealth Governments concerned with theproduction of raw materials and the supply of manufactured goods, and in thisconnection to have the assistance of representatives from a number of colonial territories.My deep sympathy went out to My people in Jamaica when many parts of the island were devastated by a hurricane on the 17th August. My Ministers in theUnited Kingdom announced an immediate grant for relief.I am glad that the health of My people has been well maintained. Greatpraise is due to all engaged in the Health Services who fought with considerable success an epidemic of influenza during the winter. I also rejoice that the deathrate from tuberculosis has sharply declined.Members of the House of Commons:I thank you for the provisions which you have made for the public services.My Lords and Members of the House of Commons:Thanks to the determination of farmers and workers throughout a tryingseason, the programme for the expansion of the production of food at home hasbeen carried on with unabated vigour.Legislation has been passed to establish a White Fish Authority with powers to reorganise, develop and regulate the White Fish Industry; and a new scheme hasbeen approved conferring wider powers on the Herring Industry Board.

An Act has also been passed toincrease the contributions which may be made from the Exchequer towards thecost of schemes for rural water supply and sewerage.My Government were gratified by the response which they received to theirappeal &quot;for extra output from the coal mines. Higher levels of industrial productionhave, however, greatly increased the demand for fuel and power; and My ministers have taken, and will continue to take, all practicable steps to encourage the recruiting of more miners, to increase the supply of fuel, electricity and other forms of powerand to ensure their more efficient use.Both sides of industry have recognised the need to remove obstacles to increased production and, with the full agreement of employers and workpeople, provision has been made to postpone the restoration of pre-war trade practices in industry.The war-time measures for the prevention and settlement of trade disputeshave been withdrawn and replaced by provisions more appropriate to peace-time conditions.Legislation which will be of great benefit to a large number of My People hasbeen passed to augment retirement pensions and the provision for widowed mothers and for children under the National Insurance Acts. The National Assist-ance allowances paid to those in need have been increased and improvements madein certain supplementary allowances paid to war pensioners.Increases have been granted in the retired pay and pensions of My regular forces.An Act has been passed to safeguard the civil interests of My Reserve and auxiliary Forces.Provision has been made for the setting up of a Courts-Martial Appeal Court to hear appeals against convictions by courts-martial.My Ministers have continued to develop the organisation of the Civil defence services and have been in consultation with representatives of industry and commerce about civil defence in industrial and commercial undertakings and withthe associations of local authorities about the organisation of the fire services on anational basis in the event of war.I gave My assent to legislation to make temporary provision for the protectionof the occupiers of certain classes of leasehold property in Great Britain.An Act was passed which extends the powers and duties of the ForestryCommissioners to establish and maintain adequate reserves of growing trees.A Commission is being appointed to stimulate the more rapid expansion of cattle breeding and rearing in the Highlands of Scotland.
