DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP IIIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S E C R N TCP. ( 51)22+13RD SEPTEMBER,  1951CABINETPERSIA:    STERLING CONTROL ORDERIviemoraixlum Joy the Chsnee 11 or of the exchequer the proDiemBy virtue of the arr-sngements contained in a&quot;Lieiiioranduin of Understanding&quot; Persia receives from us very favourable treatment in the financial sphere under threeheadings:(i)    Transferable Account facilities, which allow herthe privilege of automatically making orreceiving payments in respect of third countries in sterling;(ii)    a gold revaluation guarantee  (which cost us 11.14- millions at the time of revaluation):andCOPY NO.22facilities for conversion of sterling intodollars in payment for cert air. invisiblesand for essential goods not obtainable onequivalent terms for sterling.These arrangements have been renewed by negotiation every year since 1947:    and their solejustification has been the profound importance of persian oil to our economy.      Persia continues to beable to make use of these privileges despite- the factthat we have now not had the benefit of her oil since june end, moreover, have been forced to spend some0120 millions on replacement.      Persia is in fact takingdollars of the order of $850,000 a week:    and the Persiansterling holdings to which the privileges of the Memorandumof Understanding apply amounted to  17 millions at the endof July.      Until very recently  10 millions of this wereimmobilised by Persian law in the note cover:    but legislation to free this sum has just passed its final stages,  so thatthe Persians now have access to it to meet current expenses.Although the current &quot;Memorandum&quot; terminates on19th Novembers  it contains a clause to the effect that anybalances existing on its expiry shall continue to carry the privileges in (i);.  (ii)  and (iii)  above.(iii)
The proposed Order and, what it would do2. proper at ions have been made for the promulgationof an Order placing all Persian transactions in sterling under control.      It is not designed to &quot;freeze11 Persian sterlingcompletely.      It will nullify the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot;arrangements by removing Persia from the Transferable AccountArea:    so that instead of Persia having an automatic right of transfer of sterling, her sterling payments and receipts willbecome subject to the permission of the Treasury (uxcrcised inpractice through the Bank of England).      It is the intention that the Bank should allow all normal transfers of sterlingexcept:(a)    Transfers to American Account (which is the mechanism by which Persia can obtain dollars for her sterling:(c)    transfers relating to oil, i.e.  oil itself,oil equipment, tanker hire, insurance, etc;    and(c) transfers relating to certain scarce commodities ieg. sugars iron, steel, non-ferrous metals andalloys.The measure is accordingly not intended as retaliation orsanctions against Persia, but merely as a protection to ourown economy by giving us the means of withdrawing speciallyfavourable facilities no longer justified.0ompleincntary measures in the trade sphere3- As   3 corollary to the dollar conversion facilitiesgranted to Persia;, every attempt lias boon made to diminish,calls on us for U.S. dollars by making available to herscarce goods which she would otherwise have bought  in theU . S . A .      Consequently,, with the withdrawal of the dollarfacilities;,  it will no longer be necessary to deprive ourselvesor the Commonwealth of these scarce goods,   and action has beenprepared to ensure that they no longer go to Persia.      TheBoard of Trade are ready to make an Export Control Order underwhich all existing licences for exports to Persia of specifiedscarce goods would be revoked.      The making of this Order isbeing held up until the Sterling Control Order is made.      once the Export Control Order had been mode no hew licences wouldbe issued for these scarce goods except &quot;in special circumstances.The delayk&apos; The order has not actually boon made so far because it was thought that it ..light prejudice the success of negotiations.      Nor was action taken immediately on the return of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s mission:(a) in case  it should provoke interference with theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.)  employeeswithdrawing from the oilfields;(b) in order to allow a few days for tTreimplications of the suspension of the talks to be fully realised in Persia;    and
(c)    in case it should be regarded in Persia as aneconomic sanction and thus make it moredifficult for moderate opinion there toassert itself.Future action5- It is becoming increasingly difficult to justifyfurther delay.     The consideration at 3(a)  above is nolonger relevant:    and as far as (1)  and (c)  are concernedI believe that, provided v/e ore careful to make it clear what v/e do and do not intend to do.. v/e may even succeedii&quot;: hastening the fall of Dr. ;..ussaddiQ.     At the same timev/e should be iii a position to give heart to any successorby the v/ithdrav/al of the Order in return for reasonableassurances about a settlement of the oil dispute.      Also,once the present obvious opportunity to take action has been lost it will bo less convincing for us to say that themeasures are merely protective5 ana they will inevitablysavour more of sanctions.-&quot;hide the arguments for delay are losing their force, the case for action grows stronger.      public opinion in this country will not tolerate indefinitely either thecontinued dollar drain on Persian account or the fact that by leaving Persia in the Transferable Account Area we ourselves are according to her the means of receiving payment for the oil denied to us.      Our dollar situation is deterioratingr-apidly.      /ioreovor if v/e do not act now. action later may appearto have A;on extorted by the Opposition, or the Press.The attitude of the U.S.,-..It is.  of course f oxtr-o-moly important that v/e. should do nothing to upset the close co-operation which has recentlybeen achieved with the ^mcricons.      Our position was explained to Ur. ilorriman while he v/ss in London and he will no doubtreport to the &quot;J.B. Government on his return to Washington.In addition,  I propose that while action on our part shouldnot be subject to their consent., we should ourselves approachbhleiii at once  and then,,  having made our motives and intentionsknown to them, take action inlinediately afterwards.^Vb normal dollar conversionsi&apos; It  is possible, that the Persians may attempt towithdraw the whole  lh millions;, or a substantial proportion of it; and either- to convert this into U.S.dollars through the mechanism of the&quot;Memorandum of understanding&quot;, or to transfer it elsewhere, out of reach of cur control.      I have arranged that any such attempt should bo made .cn.own to us at once, and, as the Cabinet has previously agreed, should be frustrated by the immediateissue of the Order,Re c o mi nend a t i o ns8- I recommend -(i)    That if the Persians attempt to make anyabnormal movements of sterling,, the order should be made forthwith:
(ii)    that the U.S. Government should be informed of our intention to make the Order and,unless their reaction against it is very strong, that it should be issued immediatelythere after.H.G.Treasury Chambers, S.lv.1.3RD SEPTEMBER,  1951--h-
