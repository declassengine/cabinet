DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY   OF   HISPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1951SECRETCopy No.31CP. (51) 2447th September, 1951CABINETLEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF EGYPTIAN ABROGATION OF THE1936 treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for my colleagues&apos; information the following brief exposition ofthe legal position which will arise if Egypt unilaterally abrogates the Anglo-Egyptian treaty of 1936.2. The 1936 Treaty contains no provisions for denunciation at any time.The Treaty, including the arrangements set forth in Article 8 for the stationing ofBritish forces in the Canal Zone, was to last for 20 years, following which a revision might be negotiated at the instance of either party (that is, neither partycould refuse to enter into negotiations), cf. Articles 8 and 16. If the parties failedto reach agreement on revision, then their differences were to be referred to theLeague of Nations for arbitration. The Treaty might, however, be revised by mutual consent at any time after 10 years from signature. Though it is notobligatory for either party to enter into negotiations for revision, we freely agreedto do so in 1946, as we are willing to do now; at the same time if such negotiationsfail, we are not bound to go to arbitration.3. For the Egyptians to denounce the Treaty unilaterally is therefore illegal.While it might be defensible for them to do so after the 20-year term in the absenceof successful negotiations and the failure of arbitration, such denunciation beforethe 20-year limit is clearly indefensible.4. If, therefore, the Egyptians denounce the Treaty now, it is reasonable forHis Majesty&apos;s Government to ignore their action and continue to act at least until1956 as though the Treaty was still in force. This is, of course, what we proposeto do and must do, since the Treaty provides the only legal basis for our presence in Egypt at all.5. I must, however, mention that His Majesty&apos;s Government are maintainingin the Canal Zone three or four times the number of troops which the Treaty of1936 permits. Further, our strictly legal defence for this action would be some-what specious and not very convincing. Though the Egyptian representative hasrecently taken this point in the Security Council, it has not been the ground onwhich Egypt has put her case up to now. Further, it would be difficult for egypt to put her case on this ground because, as and when Egypt made this the foundation of her case, it would be legally open to His Majesty&apos;s Government to reduce thenumber of its troops in the Canal Zone to the Treaty limits and to contend that,as soon as this Egyptian demand was officially made, His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad, with all reasonable expedition, complied with it. For Egypt to take this lineas the main ground of her abrogation of the Treaty would in addition be politicallyawkward for her, seeing that all Egyptian Governments throughout the period1947 onwards have put their case on other grounds, and this ground would notappeal to political opinion in Egypt.H.
