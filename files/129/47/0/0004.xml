SECRETCP.(51) 229 COPY NO. 3126TH JULY, 1951CABINETTHE DEATH PENALTY UNDER THE NAVAL DISCIPLINE act memorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyAt its meeting on 22nd January (C.Ivl.(51) 5th Conclusions,Minute 1) the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of defence on certain questions of policy arising out of the recommendations of the lewis and Pilcher Committees on court-martial procedure and agreedthat the preparation of a Naval Discipline Bill should proceed.    When theBill is introduced discussion of the death penalty provision in the NavalDisciplinary Code will be inevitable because for historical reasons thepresent Act differs markedly in this respect from the Army and Air force acts.    I am, therefore, anxious to introduce amendments which will bringthe Naval Code into line with the others, so far as inherent differences in circumstances allow, and which will generally ensure that the death penaltyis prescribed only in those cases where it would be logically defensibleunder modern conditions.GeneralThe amendments proposed are shown in detail in the Appendix.    Broadlythey fall under four heads:-(i)     the mandatory death sentence is everywhere abolished;(ii)     the death sentence is replaced as a maximum sentence byimprisonment exceeding two years in those cases where thelower maximum is already prescribed for a correspondingoffence in the Army and Royal Air Force (these are desertingpost and sleeping on watch in the presence of the enemy) - andalso in the case of certain other offences, if committed throughcowardice, where the analogous offences in the Army and RoyalAir Force still carry the death penalty as the maximum, e.g. -surrendering ship to the enemy when capable of making a successful defence or improperly withdrawing frcm a fight orforsaking station, and failure to use utmost exertions to carryout orders of superior officers to prepare for action or duringaction;(iii)    the death sentence is abolished in certain cases where it is nowclearly obsolete - arson in dockyards etc. , failure in defenceof convoy, and(iv)    the maximum sentence for mutiny is reduced in certain circum-stances from death to imprisonment.HIS DOCUMENT IS THE- property  OF-HIS BRITANNIC MA.-EST-Y?S-GOVERNMENT)
I need only elaborate on (iv).MutinyExperience shows that it is now possible to mitigate the severity of the sentences prescribed for mutinous offences except during war and in con-ditions equivalent to a state of war without any prejudice to naval discipline.    I propose therefore:-(a) That death be retained as the maximum punishment at all timesfor mutiny accompanied by violence (Section 10).    This would,however, be amended to prescribe the death sentence for mutinyaccompanied by threat of violence or threatened use of arms.It would also be necessary to retain the death sentence at all times as the maximum punishment for incitement to mutiny withviolence, threat of violence or threatened use of arms.(b) That otherwise the maximum sentence of death for mutinousoffences be retained only for offences committed in time of warand, in time of peace, for those committed in circumstancesanalogous to active service under the Army code and when under orders for such service.2. &apos;Active service&quot; as a term does not exist in the present naval discipline Act; but the amendment would retain the death penalty for mutinyin the following circumstances:-(a) Service during operations, or in an area in which operations aretaking place, against the enemy.    The word &quot;enemy&quot; is alreadydefined in the Act to include armed rebels, armed mutineers andpirates but would need to be extended to include armed riotersand forces such as the North Koreans and Chinese with whom weare now engaged in hostilities without being in a formal state ofwar.(b) Service by persons who are landed in foreign countries in defenceof life and property.I am advised that this would result in a reasonably close approximation to&quot;active service&quot; under the Army and Air Force Acts.    I do not propose,however, to take powers similar to those in the Army and Royal Air Forcecodes, whereby either the Admiralty or naval authorities could, in certaincircumstances, by declaration, place a force under active service conditions for purposes of discipline, solely to make a mutinous offence incur the death penalty as the maximum punishment.3. The Minister of Defence and the Secretaries of State for War andAir have expressed their concurrence in these proposals so far as mutinyis concerned, and have no objection to the Admiralty proceeding with theother proposals mentioned in paragraph 1.    I understand that, if the pro-posals are put into effect, the Army and Air Councils would wish to amend theArmy and Air Force Acts to provide that the death sentence for mutinousoffences would be incurred under conditions broadly similar to those des-cribed in the amendments and that they would also wish to consider, for inclusion in the next year&apos;s Annual Bill, whether some further amendment ofthe death sentence provisions in Sections 4 and 6 of those Acts would benecessary in the interests of uniformity.    I therefore seek the approval ofthe Cabinet to include in the Naval Discipline Bill the amendments shown inthe third column of the Appendix.P.Admiralty, S.W.1, &apos;26TH JULY, 1951.
