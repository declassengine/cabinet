IS   DOCUMENT  IS  THE  PROPERTY   OF  HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY\S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for me Cabinet.   September 1951SECRETCP. (51) 245\Qth September, 195131CABINETLONG TERM FINANCIAL PROSPECTS OF THE british transport commission memorandum by Minister of transport at a Meeting of the Cabinet on 19th March, 1951, I was invited (CM. 51,21st Conclusions) to submit to my colleagues a Memorandum on the long termfinancial prospects of the British Transport Commission.2. Annex A gives the net Book value as at 31st December, 1950, of the fixed assets of the various parts of the Commission^ undertaking and the gross and netoperating receipts (before deducting interest and other central charges) derived from each branch of its activities for the year 1950. This clearly shows the predominat-ing importance of British Railways which account for over 80 per cent, of theCommission^ fixed assets and over 60 per cent, of its gross receipts. london transport accounts for a further 10 per cent, of the assets and gross revenue. Themain features of London Transport, which has an established record of goodmanagement, are not likely to be modified substantially in the foreseeable future.It is clear, therefore, that unless some radical alteration takes place in the wholepattern of the Commissions system its prosperity will depend mainly upon thefinancial results of the operation of the railways.In relation to the net value of the fixed assets employed the highest net returnswere earned by the Commission^ ships. Fair results were also obtained from theRoad Passenger undertakings purchased by the Commission and still operated undera Company structure. Road Haulage during 1950 failed to meet its operatingexpenses by more than  1 million. This is disappointing, but the Road haulage executive was much engaged during 1950 in the difficult task of consolidating thevery large number of undertakings (nearly 3,000 in total) acquired under the Trans-port Act, and substantially better results should be obtained hi future. But clearly a small percentage variation up or down in railway receipts or expenses wouldoutweigh in importance any corresponding variation which can be regarded as atall probable in the rest of the Commission^ undertaking.It is to be noted that the gross receipts of the railways (after meeting a loss on collection and delivery services) exceeded their operating expenses by  234-million. They were thus not operated at an actual loss although their net revenuewas insufficient to meet their due contribution to Central Charges which includeinterest on British Transport Stock.3. The two aspects of the Commission^ undertaking which bulk largest inthe public eye are the growing deficiency in its net revenue and the past andorospective increases in its charges.The following figures show the Commission^ revenue deficiency for the threecompleted calendar years of its existence:  1948 1949 1950Year ended 31st December      Net operating surplus (including &quot; otherincome&quot;)   ............    45,205,585      31,294,613      40,024,492Less central charges   .........    49,938,409      52,055,846      54,107,804Deficiency for year     ......... 4,732,824 20,761,233      .14,083,312Deficit on Net Revenue Account as at31st December     ......... 4,732,824 25,494,057      39,577,36941208 b
Having regard to the scale of the Commission^ operations these figures arenot yet unmanageably large; the disquieting feature about them is that so long asthe costs of labour and materials continue to increase they will continue^ to growand may well become formidable because the machinery provided in the 1 ransponAct for effecting adjustments of charges is so slow in operation that a substantialdefipit can be incurred between the time when an increase is justified by unavoidable-ab!e rises in costs and the time when it can be authorised. The Commissionpoint out in their Annual Report for 1950 that if the increases eventually madein their charges had been authorised earlier the deficit of  14 million for the yearmight have been avoided altogether. Similarly, the figures for 1951 are alreadyprejudiced by heavy losses during the early months due to a sudden and large increase in costs (including increased rates of pay costing about  20 million in afull year) which the Commission were unable to meet by an immediate increasein their charges. The position would have been a good deal worse had not thepermanent members of the Transport Tribunal, whom (as required by the transport act) I consulted with regard to the most recent increase in charges which took effect in April, taken the responsibility of tendering me their advice without hearingobjectors. Demands for increased pay and pensions by the Commission^ stallare maturing at the present time and if and so far as they are acceded to a furtheraccretion to the deficiency is to be expected pending an appropriate increase intheir charges.The lag between increases in expenses and increases in charges is of importanceonly during a period of generally rising costs which outweigh any economies whichthe Commission can reasonably be expected to achieve. It is primarily due.pending the coming into force of charges schemes, to the obligation imposed on me by the Act to consult the Transport Tribunal before I authorise an increase of charges by Regulations. In the case of the increases authorised last year delayalso arose owing to Ministerial discussion of my proposals. On that occasion aperiod of over six months (4th October, 1949, to 27th April, 1950) elapsed betweenthe Commission^ application to me and the announcement of my decision. Ofthis period, the application was before the Tribunal from 28th November to16th February, thirteen days being taken up by the public hearing of the Corn-mission^ case and of objections by interested bodies.A protracted period of steeply rising costs was not contemplated when theAct was passed. It has resulted in two applications to me already for regulationsauthorising an increase of charges, and a third is only too likely in the near future to meet further increases in wages now under negotiation. In my view, the existing statutory procedure needs modification in two respects. Firstly, it should be made more speedy, and secondly the Minister of Transport (and through him theGovernment) should not be directly responsible for authorising increases. TheMinister is in any case for practical purposes bound, by the advice given by themembers of the Tribunal. There is, I think, a strong case for amending legislation to authorise the Commission itself to raise its charges to meet substantial andunavoidable increases in its costs subject only to subsequent ratification by theTribunal. The procedure would have to be worked out in detail, but what I have in mind is that subject to the presentation by the Commission to the Tribunal of its full case for an increase, it should be able to make the increase effective at oncewithout prejudice to subsequent modification by the Tribunal. Such a procedure would provide a reasonable safeguard for the public, because the Commission wouldbe anxious not to make increases which on examination proved to be unjustified,and would avoid the delay which, so long as present conditions last, must inevitahlylead to a cumulative deficiency of net revenue. It would also avoid the political difficulties inherent in direct approval of increases by a Minister.4. The Commission understandably feel somewhat aggrieved that increases in the cost of other commodities and services are accepted by the public withcomparatively little complaint while increases in transport charges renderedinevitable by precisely similar causes arouse violent objection and iead to allegations of inefficiency. If, for instance, they had been able to raise their charges by thesame percentage over pre-war as had taken place in the price of coal without going through any statutory procedure their financial difficulties would be at an end. one reason for the general reaction to increases of transport charges is no doubt the publicity involved in proceedings before the Transport Tribunal, where objectorsare certain to suggest that the Commission ought to be able to effect large economies and to draw attention to the bad effects of the increases on the particular interestwith which they are concerned.
The increases in charges which have taken place on the main line railwayssince the beginning of the late war are given in Annex B. -5. As a commercial undertaking the Commission, if it is to maintain its financial position, must adjust its charges from time to time should thisbecome necessary to meet unavoidable increases in its costs. There is no reasonto suppose that such increases will be out of line with those which take placje inother industries in similar circumstances or that with them the Commission wouldnot be able to meet its financial obligations except to the extent of deficienciesdue to the time lag between increases of costs and authorisation of charges necessaryto meet them. These deficiencies can become cumulatively serious but they arenot so yet and apart from them the financial position of the Commission does notat present give ground for alarm.By the end of 1950 the Commission had used about  100 million of theirliquid resources for capital purposes which they had power to finance by borrowing.Provided that they are allowed to exercise their borrowing powers by the issue of stock on the market to meet this and future capital expenditure, their cash resourcesshouid be sufficient for several years to provide for additional expenditure on arrears of maintenance and to meet further deficits of the same order as those that havealready occurred.6. The Commission, like any other commercial undertaking, can improve its financial position only by increasing its revenue or reducing its expenditure.It would not be unreasonable to hope for an increase of up to say  4 million per annum in the net receipts of the Road Haulage Executive. Until a Schemecovering the charges made by this Executive comes into force it has practically a free hand in adjusting its charges to its costs. It was not to be expected that thisExecutive would attain full efficiency while it was welding the nearly 3,000 separateundertakings of which it is composed into an operational whole.No great increase in the total volume of railway freight traffic can be looked for. The total quantity of goods to be moved cannot be affected by any action onthe Commission^ part and the railways can only increase their share of it byattracting traffic away from other means of transport. This is no easy task and,so far as the traffic came from the Road Haulage Executive, little if any advantage to the Commission would accrue from it. The Railway Executive carried a largertonnage of freight (by 0-4 per cent) in 1950 than in 1949. The Executive may reasonably be expected to hold their own, but although they will no doubt continueto do all they can to secure traffic it would be unrealistic to look for any substantial increase.The tendency of passenger traffic, both in the Railway and the london transport Executives, has been to fall. Gross receipts from passengers by theRailway Executive declined by over  7 million in 1950 as compared with 1949.The corresponding decline for London Transport (road and rail) was over 4- million notwithstanding certain increases in fares which came into force on1st October, 1950.The gross passenger receipts from provincial and Scottish road passenger services owned by the Commission increased from  35-5 million in 1949 to 38-4 million in 1950, or by 8 -1 per cent., and the passenger journeys by 10-8 percent, in England and Wales and 7-8 per cent, in Scotland, but at the same time thenet traffic receipts showed a decline from  4 - 3 million to  3 - 4 million.It is impossible to predict the future trends of passenger traffic and receiptsbecause at any particular level of fares they depend&quot; to an appreciable extent onsuch uncertain factors as the habits of the travelling public, the amount of its freespending power, the number of private motor cars in use and even on occasion the weather. It would not be prudent to look for any significant increase in theCommission^ net receipts from passenger traffic in the foreseeable future at anypracticable level of charges. Passenger transport schemes under Part IV of theTransport Act if and when they materialise might add to the Commission&apos;s income in the future but not to such an extent as to alter materially the present picture.7. The Commission regard it as necessary for the improvement of their financial position that there should be new bases of charge for their services whichwill take much greater account of the actual types and cost of service on the onehand and will also recognise that over a wide field the Commission^ services arenot a monopoly and that the ordinary principles of competitive business must beallowed a greater place in the fixing of charges in detail. There is undoubtedly41208 R 9
force in this latter contention because in those fields where the Commission do not enjoy a monopoly it is possible for their competitors, who do not have to takethe rough with the smooth, to undercut it in the case of the more attractive traffics.At the same time the Transport Tribunal are likely to look very closely at anycharging powers of the Commission which would enable them with their largeresources to put competitors out of business by charging unduly low rates over aperiod. A modernisation of their charges structure will doubtless be beneficial tothe Commission^ revenue, and the Transport Tribunal, in considering schemes of charges by the Commission, will have to have regard to the Commission^ actualand necessary costs and the fulfilment of the obligations laid upon it by theTransport Act.8. The Commission could have undoubtedly made its services for bothpassengers and goods more efficient and attractive if circumstances had been suchas to allow it a free hand in capital investment. The Commission, not unnaturallyperhaps, takes the view that it has received and is receiving less than its propershare of the national resources. In the short term increased capita! investment would no doubt have some beneficial effect on its revenue. It would make it easier for the Commission to retain, on the railways, traffic which may otherwise be diverted to road transport and would doubtless lead to economies in operating costs and increases in efficiency. The effect of major increased capital investment in the long term is difficult to assess.Electrification of lines with heavy traffic in the neighbourhood of large townscan yield very good results, as the recent electrification of the line from LiverpoolStreet to Shenfield has shown. The total cost of this scheme was about  8 million,and in the 11 months of 1950 for which figures are available loaded coaching trainmiles increased by some 33 per cent., passenger journeys by nearly 50 per cent,and passenger receipts by over 40 per cent. Electrification on a wider scale wouldhave less certain results in improving net revenue, and would in any case be limitedfor some time to come owing to the demand which it would make on scarce national resources and the overall shortage of generating capacity.9. As regards economies, so long as the physical shape of the Commission^transport system remains more or less as it is at present economies on a major scaleare not to be expected. There is no doubt that the Commission and the railway executive are fully alive to the need to effect all practicable economies and theyare entitled to claim a fair measure of success in spite of the difficulties which, in common with other sectors of industry, they have had to face. A general indication of this is afforded by the fact that with a general level of charges of 8! per cent,and 55 per cent, over pre-war for goods and passenger traffic respectively theCommission was towards the end of 1950 in approximate financial equilibrium. Aparticular indication is that between 1st January, 1948, when the Commission took over the railways and the end of 1950 the total working expenses per train mile,adjusted throughout to end-1950 prices, had fallen by 25., equivalent to a saving of 35 to  40 million a year on the output of train miles at the end of 1950.The consolidation of the undertaking of the Road Haulage Executive, togetherwith economies from improvements in organisation and equipment of the Corn-mission^ undertaking generally should show results year by year, although possibly on a diminishing scale. There is, however, widespread opposition by the publicwhenever proposals are made to close branch lines or to make even quite smallchanges in the services offered. The Commission is, moreover, faced with reluctanceon the part of the staffs of the Executives to depart from traditional organisationalstructures or methods of working. In its last Annual Report the Commission refers to the necessity for a greater willingness to accept changes, whether in conditionsof work or in types of service or in proposals to integrate the Commission^ servicesand to avoid costly delaying action on each proposal for reorganisation. The recenisuccessful unofficial strike by large numbers of drivers in the Road haulage executive against the extension of the employment of Inspectors on the road, the objection of drivers of heavy vehicles generally to an increase in the maximumspeed of these vehicles from 20 to 30 miles an hour and threatened trouble as soonas economic transfers of traffic from rail to road or vice versa are proposed arecases in point.10. A good deal has been said, both during the passage of the Transport Actthrough Parliament and since, on the possibility of effecting major economiesthrough integration, and the Act in fact lays upon the Commission the duty ofproviding a properly integrated system of transport.
&quot; Integration &quot; is in itself a term which would cover a wide variety of modi-iications in organisation, from working arrangements between the Executive forthe handling of traffic, to a radical modification of the whole transport system.The Commission, after consulting the Trades Unions, have produced a State-ment of Policy on the integration of freight services by road and rail which specifiedthe traffics for which each is specially suitable and efficient and lays down lines ofco-operation between the two Executives concerned.This, so far as it goes, is on the right lines, but to my mind a bolder and more positive approach to this problem is needed. It may be that the possibilities of integration in the wider sense are limited, but it would be rather extraordinary ifthe railways, which assumed their present shape in the nineteenth century, plus thelargely unrelated growth of road transport, have achieved the right balance betweenthe two which is essential to a fully integrated system.The primary question which to my mind needs an answer is what part shouldbe played by the railways in a fully integrated system having regard to all themeans of transport and techniques of handling goods and passengers now available or likely to be so in the foreseeable future. The comparatively expensive and rigidequipment of the railways makes them the solid foundation on which to build.Whatever the right answer, road transport can easily be adjusted to it. Its mainassets are shortlived and can be expanded or contracted over a comparatively briefperiod of years without excessive financial loss. Until this fundamental issue iscleared it is hardly possible for the country to have a coherent transport policy.If the railway system ought, in the general interests of transport economy, to be substantially contracted we should spend less money on the railways and more onthe highway system. If it turns out on inquiry that the relative proportions of rail and of road transport equipment are about right so much the better. But until there is a clear picture of the ultimate pattern of the transport system of the countryour transport policy as a whole will be liable to drift and capital investment in transport to be devoid of firm guiding principles.If we had this clear picture many subsidiary but important questions would fall into their proper place. The railways would be able to proceed much more rapidly and extensively with the closing of branch lines (if this is the right ultimatepolicy), the transport requirements of trade, industry, agriculture and markets couldbe progressively related to a known pattern and the railways might be able tosecure additional financial resources by the disposal of land or other property if it proved to be surplus to the requirements of a fully integrated system.11. I do not think that the comprehensive inquiry which would be necessaryto explore and establish the facts and possibilities on which a national transport policy could be built could properly be undertaken by the Commission. Not onlyis it faced with an immense task in the day to day administration of its vast under-taking, and preoccupied with railway finances and its relations with labour, but thescope of the inquiry would far transcend the Commission^ range of activities. TheCommission is concerned with only a small, although very important, fraction of road transport, and is not directly interested in the economics of the highwaysystem. Moreover, the great bulk of its expert staff, to say nothing of its work-people, are bound to favour strongly the particular form of transport with whichthey have been associated during their working lives.In my view it is imperative that this task should be put in hand without delay.Having regard to its magnitude and importance and of the necessity that thoseundertaking it should have the fullest access to all available facts, I do not thinkthat it could be undertaken by any body short of a Royal Commission.12. The question of a subsidy to the Commission has been frequently raised.It would I think, be a most unwise step to make any kind of annual subsidy to theCommission for the purpose of reducing its charge, whether for passengers or goods.There is no reason why users of the Commission^ services should not pay for them what they cost to provide, including the moderate remuneration provided in theTransport Act for the capital employed. The machinery of the Transport Actshould be sufficient to see that these charges are fair to the public and fairly distri-buted over the different types of user. The defects of this machinery during aperiod of steeply rising costs do not destroy its value and effectiveness for more normal times. A revenue subsidy would, moreover, diminish the pressure on theCommission and its Executives to make financial ends meet by their own efforts,and would certainly do nothing to discourage demands by the Commission^ per-sonnel for higher wages and improved conditions of service.   The accumulated
deficiency of net revenue is not yet so large as to be unmanageable over a periodof years without any serious impact on charges. A case could, possibly, be madefor a subsidy to cover the accumulated deficiency of net revenue when costs have become stabilised. It would, I think, be unwise to consider a subsidy earlier to liquidate the deficiency in net revenue because it might set up a precedent for anannual contribution until comparative stabilisation of costs is reached.A capital subsidy would hardly be justified. So long as the Commission canborrow at reasonable rates it would have to be a very large subsidy to give materialrelief to&quot; the revenue position.13.   Briefly, therefore:  (a) The accumulated revenue deficiency of the Commission is not, so far. ofunmanageable size and is due primarily to the lag between unavoidableincreases in the Commission^ costs and the authorisation of increased charges necessary to meet them. The Commissions finances are not,in fact, moving towards disaster.(b) This lag and the consequential deficiencies in revenue arising from it are due to the procedure laid down in the Transport Act for controlling theCommission^ charges. Legislation should be introduced to enable theCommission to adjust their charges subject to subsequent ratification bythe Tribunal.(c) Although progressive economies are to be expected these are not likelyto be of such a character as to modify substantially the financial positionof the Commission or materially to affect the level of its charges.(d) Provided that the Commission are enabled to adjust their charges to theirnecessary expenses as is done in trade and industry generally, there isno reason why they should not attain and maintain financial equilibriumas soon as prices become more stable.(e) There may possibly be a field for substantial economies in a radicalmodification of the transport system. An examination of this verylarge and intricate problem should be undertaken by a Royal Corn-mission.(/) There is no strong case for a Government subsidy to the Commission atpresent.A.
