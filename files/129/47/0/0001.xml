THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MA ESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential cp. (51) 226 COPY NO.,24TH JULY, 1951CABINETRAILWAY MAN-POWER AND WINTER COAL supplies memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power from the point of view of our coal supplies next winter, I desireto give my strongest support to the proposals , submitted by the Ministerof Transport in CP. (51) 215, for strengthening railway man-power.   I feel bound to do this not only by reason of the great anxiety which I myself feelon this subject but also in the light of the urgent representations whichI have received from the Coal Industry National Consultative council which embraces both the National Coal Board and the National Union ofMineworker s.2. The experience of last winter showed clearly that the volume ofcoal traffic then handled represented the maximum which the railways were capable of coping with, v/hile the expected increase in production next winter is much greater (2-4 million tons as compared with 1 million tons)than the imports which had to be handled last winter.   Moreover, it is not even as though the railway situation to-day is as good as it was a yearago, for this summer the situation on the railways is such that the railway executive has had to put embargoes on the movement of coal trains, a step which in a summer period is unprecedented in living memory.3.        &apos;  The present outlook is therefore one of exceptional gravity, for notonly are we likely to have a deficit this summer of 1.25 million tons of large coal, but we are faced also with the risk that next winter our difficulties willbe still further aggravated through the railways being unable to moveeven the whole of the coal which we hope to produce.4. Such a development would be most serious from two points of view.First, if the railways cannot clear the coal from the pits, stoppage of produc-tion and unemployment of miners will be inevitable and total supplies willbe even less than we expect.   Second, if the railways are unable to movecoal to the points where it is required, we shall be prevented from givingassistance in those areas which will be most short of supplies.   This will fall with especial force upon house coal for the domestic consumer, which,in addition to being very seriously inadequate in quantity, will also beunevenly distributed over different parts of the country.   In particular, theproblem of s^^pplying London with house coal will become very acute.   Already.,indeed, the stocks of house coal in the London area are the worst on recordfor this time of year (101,000 tons as compared with 176,000 tons in 1950,and 325,000 tons in 1948 and 1949).5. I accordingly ask my colleagues to give full weight to the importanceof doing everything possible to increase railway man-power, and thus to mitigate so far as possible the extremely serious house coal problem whichwill inevitably face us next winter.P. J.N-B.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 1.,24TH..JULY, 1951.
