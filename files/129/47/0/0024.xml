CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1? GOVERNMENT)confidential cp.(51) 249 COPY NO. &apos;  j17TH SEPTEMBER, 1951CABINETTHE MAN-POWER POSITION ON THE BRITISH RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of Labour &quot;and National service in his paper (CP. (.1) 237), the Minister of Transport asks that further consideration should be given to the request for the deferment of the calling-up of about 2,900 young railwaymen.   This is the same proposal that he put forward originally in his paper (C.P. (51) 215), and which theCabinet decided against as recently as 26th July (CM. (51) 55th Conclusions,Minute 5).   I am still strongly of the opinion that it is undesirable to defer the calling-up of railway workers and I can find nothing in theMinister of Transporfs new paper which was not in substance before theCabinet when this question was considered,2, I should like to recapitulate very briefly the main arguments in myearlier paper.   These were as follows(1)   it is only by the maintenance of the principle that the obligation to perform national service in peace time is of almost universalapplication that we can hope to continue to have general public support for the policy;(2)   if a breach in the almost universal application of national service were allowed in favour of the railways, how could we refuse to grantapplications for the deferment of calling-up of young men in other important industries and services which are also short of labour?Despite the fact that it must have become well-known that defermenton industrial grounds will not be granted, my Department has, sincethe beginning of 1950, received representations for the deferment of young men in nearly twenty industries or sections of industries.In particular, if deferment were granted to relatively unskilledmen of 18 on the railways, how could it be refused to young men in,for example, the engineering industry who have become skilled oncompleting lengthy apprenticeships at about the age of 21 and areemployed on very important work connected, for example, withrearmament?   Apart, therefore, from the serious danger that ifdeferment were once granted on any scale it might be difficult tomaintain national service at all, the effect on the numbers of men available to meet the needs of the Armed Forces might be very serious.Despite the removal of the agricultural blanket and the acceptance by the Services of some men in medical categories III and IV, we expect to be about 17,000 short of the numbers of national servicementhe Services need during the current financial year, and I suggestthat we dare not run the risk of being substantially shorter still.If deferment were once granted on any scale, we shall find ourselveshaving to adopt the very unpopular course of imposing a still longer period of whole-time national service on the young men who were called up.
3. If a decision were taken to grant deferment to railwaymen, or toother workers such, for example, as draughtsmen, it would be wrong to doit on the basis of &apos;block&apos; deferment of a whole grade of workers in an industry.   The only method that would be fair to the individual and at thesame time in the national interest would be to give all employers theopportunity to apply for deferment in respect of their employees on thegrounds of the importance of the work to the national effort.   This wouldhave two results.   In the first place, it would require the resuscitation ofthe war-time machinery of deferment involving the   re-establishmentof the Man-Power Boards, of which there were fourty-four during the war.Secondly, it would mean that there would be a most serious shortage ofnational servicemen for the Forces.   This could only be made good by asubstantial extension of the period of national service.4. I ask my colleagues to re-affirm the decision they took on26th July.A.R.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S. W. 1. ,17TH SEPTEMBER, 1951.
