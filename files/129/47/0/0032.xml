(51) 257 COPY NO.26TH SEPTEMBER, 1951CABINETTHE OIL DISPUTE WITH PERSIAiviemorandiim by the Secretary of State for foreign affair rsThe 1901 ConcessionThe original agreement for the exploitation of oil resources inSouth Persia was entered into between the Per si an Government andMr. W.K. D&apos;Arcy on the 28th May, 1901.   It included the followingprovi sions(a)       The exclusive right for 60 years to exploit pet roleum throughoutthe Persian Empire, with the exception of five provinces inNorthern Persia.(b) On the date of the formation of the first exploitation company the Persian Government was to receive   20,000 in cash,  20,000in paid up shares, and &quot;annually a sum equal to sixteen per cent&quot;of the Company*s profits,(c) On expiration of the concession all &quot;materials, buildings, andapparatuses&quot; of the company should become the property of thegovernment.2. Oil in commercial quantities was discovered at Masjid^i^Sulaimanin 1908, and the Anglos-Persian Oil Company (now the anglo o^Iranian oil company (A. I. C. C. )) took over Mr. D&apos;Arcy&apos;s rights in 1909.His Majesty&apos;s Governments relations with the A. I. O. C.-.-.-j. In 1914 an agreement v/as made between the Treasury and theCompany which was directed to ensuring supplies of fuel oil for the navy and to making sure that these supplies, which would be required in increasing quantities, were purchased by the Government at reasonable prices.His Maj esty&apos;s Government subscribed to the Company a total of  2,200,000.They became entitled to appoint two Government Direct ors:  and held by virtue of their capital subscription a majority of the share votes,    (Thesituation at the present date is that His Majesty&apos;s Government has a majorityshare holding - 55. 86% of the ordinary shares, and a majority also of votes52,55%.)   The arrangement between Treasury and the Company conferred on thGovernment directors a right of veto which, however, the Government under-took not to exercise except in certain circumstances.The 1933 Concession4. The provi si oil in the D&apos;Arcy contract whi ch provided that thePersian Government would receive a royalty defined as &quot;16% of the net annual profits&quot; proved period cal ly to be a source of differences of opinon as to its interpretation.    The main feature of this method of payment wasML
that the Persian income from oil was tied directly to trading results, andthe slump of the early 1930&apos;s had its effect on Persia.   The question was brought to a head in July, 1932, when it was announced that the PersianGovernment would receive only  307,000 in respect of royalty for thepreceding year.    (This sum compared with  1,238, 000 in respect of 1930which was paid on almost the same quantity of oi 1 produced. )5. The Persian Governments attack on the Company began with an organised and abusive press campaign. There were comparisons betweenthe share due to the Persian Government by way of royalty and that due tothe British Government by way of income tax and dividends,6, The Company was accused of falsifying accounts and wilfullydefrauding the I-^ersian Treasury.   In November, 1932, the company sManager in Persia was handed a Note by the Persian Government declaringthe Concession cancelled on grounds of the Company&apos;s failure to acceptmodifications:   and subsequently the Persian Minister for Foreign affair rsstated that the stipulations of the Concessi on were not in accord withthe legitimate interests of Persia.   The numerous complaints against theCompany included accusations that the amount of royalty had been unfairlyarrived at and that the Company had failed to exploit their concessionareas fully.7, His Majesty1 s Minister in Tehran informed the Persian Governmentthat their action in cancelling the Concession was a wholly inadmissiblebreach of its terms and asked for an immediate withdrawal.    As thePersian Government persi st ed in their refusal of thi s demand, HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the 14-th December submitted the matter to theCouncil of the League of Nations.   Before the case was heard, however, theparties , while reserving their respective legal points of view, agreed toenter into a provisional arrangement to undertake negotiations for a newConcession.8. On the 3rd April Sir John Cadman of the A. I. G, C. arrived in tehran and negotiations were begun.   The Persian Minister prepared astatement of their desiderata, which were considered fantastic in their scope.    It was made clear that their proposals were entirely unacceptableand that no agreement could possibly be based on them.    On the 21stApril the Compaiiy submitted a memorandum, whi ch was essentially adraft of a new Concession.    The Ministers stated that an agreement on   &apos;this basis was equally impossible.   Sir John Cadman then asked for afarewel 1 audience with the Shah, at which the latter consigned the Persianproposals to the wastepaper basket and virtually agreed to the Company1 draft Concession contract, which was rapidly finalised and ratified on the28th May.9, This agreement embodied a new formula for royalties whichhenceforward could be calculated under three headings(i)       a fixed sum per ton of oil exported or sold in Iran.   This was to be4s. per ton subject to adjustment to compensate the Government forany fluctuations in the value of English currency as compared withthe value of gold in London, taking the 1933 price as par,(ii)       a sum varying between 6d. and Is. per ton similarly adjusted ingold in consideration of exemption from Iranian taxation on theCompany&apos;s operations.

In November, 1932, the Company&apos;sManager in Persia was handed a Note by the Persian Government declaringthe Concession cancelled on grounds of the Company&apos;s failure to acceptmodifications:  and subsequently the Persian Minister for Foreign affair rsstated that the stipulations of the Concessi on were not in accord withthe legitimate interests of Persia.

His Majesty&apos;s Minister in Tehran informed the Persian Governmentthat their action in cancel ling the Concession was a wholly inadmissiblebreach of its terms and asked for an immediate withdrawal.   As thePersian Governmenl; persisted in their refusal of thi s demand. HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the 14th December submitted the matter to theCouncil of the League of Nations.   Before the case was heard , however, theparties , whi le reserving thei r respect ive legal points of vi ew, agreed toenter into a provisional arrangement to undertake negotiations for a newConcession,8. On the 3rd April Sir John Cadman of the A. I. O, C. arrived in tehran and negotiations were begun.   The Persian Minister prepared astatement of their desiderata, which were considered fantastic in their scope.    It was made clear that their proposals were entirely unacceptableand that no agreement could possibly be based on them.    On the 21stApril the Company submitted a memorandum, which was essentially adraft of a new Concession.    The Ministers stated that an agreement onthis basis was equally impossible.   Sir John Cadman then asked for afarewell audience with the Shah, at which the latter consigned the Persianproposals to the wastepaper basket and virtually agreed to the Company&apos;draft Concession contract, which was rapidly finalised and ratified on the28th May.9. This agreement embodied a new formula for royalties whichhenceforward could be calculated under three headings:-(i)        a fixed sum per ton of oil exported or sold in Iran.   This was to be4s. per ton subject to adjustment to compensate the Government forany fluctuations in the value of English currency as compared, withthe value of gold in London, taking the 1933 price as par,(ii)        a sum varying between 6d.  and Is. per ton similarly adjusted ingold in consideration of exemption from Iranian taxation on theCompany&apos;s operations.
(iii)        a sum equal to 20% of any distribution of the Ordinary stock-holders of the Company, whether as dividends or in relation toGeneral Reserve, in excess of a certain minimum annual sum( 671,280).10. In addition the Persian Government would be entitled to a sum equalto 20% of the difference between the Company&apos;s General Reserve at theend of the Concessi on and the General Reserve at 31st December, 1932.(N, B. These payments were not given a gold guarantee.)11, The new formula was designed to relate income more or less to production, although item (iii) provided a means whereby the PersianGovernment was also in a position to participate in the Company&apos;sprosperity during good years:   (i) and (ii) however, ensured that Persia didnot suffer serious financial and material loss in bad years.12. In August, 1933, identical letters were addressed by the UnitedKingdom and Persian Governments to the Regi strar of the Permanent Court ofInternational Justice bringing to the notice of the Court Article 22 of theConvention whereby the parties agreed in certain circumstances to have recourse to the good offices of the President (or Vice-President) of theCourt in connection with the nomination of an umpire or sole arbitrator, and asking the Court to accept these functions.    The Registrar of the Courtreplied that the Court saw no objection to their acceptance of these functions.The Supplemental Oil Agreement, 194913, In the spring of 1943 the Prime minister informed H, Ivi. ambassador that there was much criticism of the share which the Persian Governmentwas receiving from the operation of A.I.O.C., as compared with theGovernments of Venezuela and Iraq from the operations of their concessionarycompanies.    He made it clear at the same time, however, that the Govern-ment was not demanding an alteration of the concession as a right.   As aresult the A.I.O.C. agreed to enter into negotiations with the PersianGovernment for a revision of some of the terms of the 1933 Concession.After a protracted and di fficul t negotiating iat ion (during which complaints were,inte r al ia,   again made about the relative size of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsreceipts from the Company in the form of taxation) the document known as theSupplemental Oil Agreement was drawn up and signed by the minister ofFinance in July, 1949, subj ect to rat ificat ion by the Persian Majlis.14, This agreement did not really alter the 1933 formula (seeparagraph 9).   Payments under item (i) were increased from 4s.  to 6s.  gold and under item (ii) to Is. gold.    Item (iii) was also altered in Persia&apos;s favour to provide for an immediate payment to the Government in respect ofthe sum standing at General Reserve at the 31st December, 1947, and further payments (equal to 20%) in respect of allocations to General Reservethereafter.    It was further provided that these payments should be entirelyfree from the effect of British Income Tax, and that the total annual payments in respect of dividend and allocation to General Reserve shouldbe a minimum of  4, 000,000.

If t .e agreement had been ratified the effect of these provisions would have been as follows:&quot;UnderYear                        1933 Under Supplemental DifferenceGonceion Oil Aryeemimt1948                     9.17m.  23.76m.&quot; . 14.59m.-1949                     13.5 m,  22.9m.  9.4i&apos;.v1950 (Est.)           16.0 b.  30.0)?.  14.0r:i. 38.0 Li.s   Includes a payment of 55.09m.  in respect of 1947.16, The Supplemental Agreement could be submitted to the Majlisin July, 1949, only just before the latter was prorogued, and was accordinglynot voted upon.    When a new ivlajlis was elected in September the Ministry ofFinance urged upon the Company the necessity for revising the Agreementso as to make it more acceptable to the new Majlis.   The Company repliedthat the Supplemental Oil Agreement was the result of long and difficult negotiations and they could not hold out any hope of amending it, and they pointed out that, in any case, the Majlis had not ^et reached any decisionon it.    When Mansur became Prime Minister early in 1950, the Shahinstructed him to get the Supplemental Agreement through the Majlis, buthe was uncertain how to do so and, in the event, merely staved off the issueby presenting the Agreement to the newly-el ect ed Majlis and allowing it to bereferred to a special Commission of the Majlis which, though it wassupposed to contain equal representation of the various fractions in the House,in fact contained 5 members of the National Front in its total membership of18.    Mansur later fel 1 from office and was replaced by General Razmara,The Razmara Episode17. General Raamara had a reputation for strength, and from numerousinterviews with H. M. Ambassador it appeared that he himself genuinel yfavoured the Supplemental Agreement, although he wished to see it modified in certain respects.    His position vi s a vis the Majlis was weakened byhis unsuccessful attempts to promote legisl at ion for administrative reform.He was reluctant to give the Supplemental Agreement his open support andhis public references to it were in equivocal terms.    The bill embodying theAgreement therefore remained with the Majlis Oil Commission which, inNovember, 1950, recommended to the Majlis that it di d not sufficientlysecure Persian interests.   Razmara1 s Finance Minister was put up to make abelated defence of the Agreement and to withdraw it from the Majlis.   his speech was criticised on all sides, and he was forced to resign;  theivlajlis later voted its approval of the Commission^ report.   At the end of theyear, the National Front, with its handful of representatives in the Majlis,was energetically exploiting the situation, openly threatening the lives ofanyone inside and outside the Majlis who favoured the Suppl ementalAgreement and a finally - raising the cry of nationalisation.    This was taken up by student demonstrators organised by the National Front, and theMajlis Commission began to formulate proposals to this end.

His position vi s a vis the Majlis was weakened byhi s unsuccessful attempts to promote legisl at ion for administ rative reform.He was reluctant to give the Supplemental Agreement his open support andhis public references to it were in equivocal terms.    The bi 11 embociyi ng theAgreement therefore remained ned with the Majlis Oil Commission which, inNovember, 1950, recommended to the Majlis that it did not sufficientlysecure Persian interests.   Razmara1 s Finance Minister was put up to make abelated defence of the Agreement and to withdraw it from the Majlis.   his speech was critici sed on all sides, and he was forced to resign;  theMajlis later voted its approval of the Commission^ report.

This was taken up by student demonstrators organised by the National Front, and theMajlis Commissi on began to formulate proposals to this end.
18. His Majesty&apos;s Government, who had hitherto confined their inter-vention in the matter to unofficial representation, felt that in the light ofthis direct threat to the Company&apos;s position they must take steps to make their position clear.   Accordingly, in a Note Verbale dated 28th February,1951, they informed the Persian Government that in their view the Company1 sconcession agreement, under its Articles 21 and 26, could not legally be* terminated by an act such as nationalisation, and added that the Companycould not ne got iat e under threat of nationalisation.    Meanwhile on10th February the Company, in order to strengthen Razmara1 s hand, not onlyinformed him that they were ready to negotiate an entirely new Agreementbased on an equal sharing of profits but offered him substantial monetarys\xpport ( 5 millions at once and  2 millions a month for ten months, allin advance of future royalties) in order to assist the Persian Governmentin their immediat e financi al difficul ties.    Razmara preferred, however,not to reveal this offer to the Oil Commission and the Majlis and attempted to avert a nat ional isation resolut ion in anot her way.    He appeared beforethe Oil Commissi on in order to deliver reports from Persian technical,financial and legal experts which were unfavourable to nationalisation.This action \mdoubt cdl y led to his assassi nation three days later.Development of &quot;nationalisation&quot;The ivlajlis resolution19. After the assassination of the Prime Minister on the 7th march the Oil Commission lost no time in passing its resolution &quot;accepting theiproposal that oil should be nationalised throughout Persia&quot; and requestingan extension of the Commissions mandated for two months for examinationof the principle of nationalisation.    The Majlis agreed to consider this! resolut ion as a matter of &quot;doubl e urgency&quot; and it was approved by bothHouses by the 20th March.20. On the 26th April, i. e. in considerably less than two months,Dr. Musaddiq, the Chairman of the Oil Commission suddenly called a meeting and expressed his intention of pressing for a decision on the question of nationalisation.    The following day the Commission approved the text of aresolution enjoining the imply ementat ion of the  &quot;decision of the Houses ofParliament for oil nat ional isat ion throughout the country&quot; and setting out in 9 articles the method of implementation.    Once again this resolution(the so-called &quot;9-Point Law&quot;) was hustled through the Majlis and it receivedthe approval of both Houses by the 30th April.   The Shah promulgat ed thelaw on 2nd May.Establishment of the Oil Board21. The law provided for the setting-up &quot;with a view to arranging the enforcement of the law&quot; of a mixed Board composed of five senators and fivedeputies elected by either of the two Houses and a representative of theMinister of Finance.    The final appointments took place on 15th May.   Atleast five of the members were supporters of the National Front.   Theestablishment of the &quot;National Iranian Oil Company&quot; followed and the PersianGovernment thereafter persisted in referring to the A.I.O.C. as &quot;the formerCompany&quot;.22, The position was clearly fraught with danger and since it wasimperative that we should discuss with the Americans both the Fersiansituation itself and its manifold repercussions a party went to Washingtonearl y in April.
23. The Americans had not supported us in the past in our dealings with the Persians on oil.   In Persia they had declared their neutralityin the matter, an attitude which the Persians interpreted as disapprovalof our policy.    To us they frequently criticised the Company&apos;s actions andattitude.    They felt very satisfied with their own policy, exemplified by the50/50 profit-sharing agreement concluded in Saudi Arabia and thought thatwe, on the other hand, were being slow and were not keeping up with thedevelopment of feeling in Persia.   The talks in Washington in April failedto bring them solidly into line with us.   It proved at the outset that they and we held widely differing views on the strength and nature of thedemand for nationalisation in Persia.   In their view, a &quot;low bow to national i-sation&quot; was needed if we were to have any hope of stabilisi ng thesituation.    We thought that a sol ut ion based on equal sharing of profits waspossible, and that greater capitulat ion would be regarded as a sign of weakness.    Consequently although during ng the di scussi on the americans were prepared to agree pi ecemeal with the United kingdom s aims and objectives, including the fact that it was vital for the United Kingdom toretain effective control over Persian oil, they were not prepared to co-operate with us in attempting to reconcile our essential needs and Persian aspi -rations and independence in the shape of the minimum that need be given awayduring the negotiations.   Thus, while they never expressed in detailprecisely what would be involved in their own &quot;low bow to nationalisation&quot;the form of a proposal which was drawn up in London and Washington duringthe talks and which was handed to Hussein Ala on 26th April was not suchas to induce them to give us their active support, and the most they wouldpromise was benevolent neutrality.The Musaddiq period24. On the day that this proposal was made, however, the Oil Com-missi on passed its second nat i onal i sat ion resolut ion whi ch was almostidentical with the final nationalisation law (paragraph 20 above) and Hussein Alaresigned while this was before the Majlis because he could neither oppose itnor give his support.   He was replaced by Dr. iviusaddiq, somewhat to thesurprise even of the Shah and Sayyi d Zia, who had on the same day been discussing bringing the latter into power.   On the day after his resignationthe Company handed to him a protest against the Oil commission sresolut ion.25. The pace of events in Persia was now alarmingly swift.  At thisstage the Foreign Secretary on 1st May made a deliberately moderatestatement in the House of Commons which briefly recounted the historyof the Oil Concession since 1901, recapitulated the issues at stake and out -lined the proposal  (paragraph 23) which had been put to Hussein Ala.   Thestatement ended by saying that we were st ill most anxious to settle thematter by negotiation but that we could not negotiate under duress.26. On the following day, the Foreign Secretary sent for the PersianAmbassador and requested that the Persian Prime Minister should beasked to suspend action and allow time for discussion.   The Foreign Sec-retary also said that we could not accept &quot;unilateral action, whi ch wouldhave the effect of upsetting the Agreement of 1931&quot;.27. On 8th May the Persian Government replied affirming their determination to proceed with the programme of nationalisation, butconcluding with a statement that the &quot;former oil company&quot; would be invitedin a few days to discuss the implementation of the law.
28. In response to this intransi gent communication, it was decidedthat a very strongly worded Note should be sent to the PersianGovernment asking them to agree to negotiations and giving warning that a refusal to negotiate, or any attempt to proceed by unilateral action to the imply ementat ion of the recent legislation slat ion woul d have&quot;the most serious consequences&quot;.   A further attempt was also made to enlist American support.    It was clear, however, from the State Departmentsreply that they were not prepared at thi s juncture to offer support inthe use of force if the present Persian Government should refuse tonegotiate, although they would be prepared, to acquiesce in the use of force on our part either to protect British lives or in the event of a communist coup in Persia.Appl modifications ion to the Hague Court29. At this point the Company served notice on the Persian Governmentthat they wished the dispute to be submitted to arbitration in accordancewith the terms of the 1931 Concession Agreement.    The Persian Governmentrejected this request on the 26th May and demanded that the Company&apos;representatives should attend meetings for the liquidation of the Company.The Company then applied under the terms of the 1935 Agreement to thePresident of the International  Court at The Hague to appoint a solearbitrator between themselves and the Persian Government.    At the sametime His Majesty&apos;s Government submitted the matter to The Hague Courtas a dispute between the United Kingdom Government and the Persian Govern-ment.The A.I.O.C. Mission30. The Company sent out a delegation of Directors on the11th June to try to convince the Persian Government of the consequences of their policy of immediate expropriation of the Company1 s installations in Persia and to offer an alternative that would give them money for theirpresent needs, acceptance of the principle of nat ionalisat ion and afoundat ion for part nership in the future.   After meet ings at which thePer sian Delegat ion proved completely intransigent, insisting that al 1proposals must be in accordance with the Nationalisation Lav/, the Companyon the 19th June made an offer which provided for an immediate payment of 10,000,000 and a sum of  3, 000,000 a month from July onwardsduring the period necessary to reach an arrangement.    The offer also provided for the vesting of the Per si an assets of the A.I.O.C. in theNational Iranian Oil Company (N.I.O.C.) on condition that the latter wouldgrant to a new company established by the A.I.O.C. the exclusive use ofthese assets.    This offer was summarily turned down by the PersianDel egat ion on the ground that it was not consist ent with the NationalisationLaw, and the Company Del egat ion returned to the United Kingdom.31. In the meantime the general  si that ion in Abadan and the oilfieldsarea had been det eri or at ing.    The temporary Board of Directors and theN.I.O.C. began to interfere in the A.I.O.C.&apos;s operat ions and members of theBoard del ivered a series of inflamatory speeches.   Moreover they issuedinstructions that the Masters of tankers carrying oi 1 from Abadan wouldbe required before sailing to give a receipt to the  N.I.O.C. on its ownform.   As the Persians rqfused to allow a clause to be added to thisreceipt reserving the legal rights of the A.I.O.C., tanker Masters refused to sign.    The A.I.O.C.&apos;s General Manager was thereupon accused by the Persiansof sabotage, and left the country as a Bill had been presented to the Majlis onthe 21st June introducing the death penalty for such an offence;  though afterstrong representations by His Majesty&apos;s Government and the United StatesGovernment Dr. Musaddiq announced that the Bill would be withdrawn,
At the same time H. M. S. Mauritius was sent to Iraqi waters oppositeAbadan and all women and children were evacuated from the oilfieldsand from Abadan.32. On the 5th July the International Court made an Order calling upon the Persian Government and the A. I. O. C. to do nothing which wouldaggravate the dispute, the A.I.O.C. in the meantime to be permitted tocarry on their industrial and commercial operations as they had beendoing prior to the 1st May under the supervision of an Anglo-PersianBoard with one neutral member.    On the 7th ^uly His Majesty1 s government informed the Persian Government that they accepted the Court&apos;s Order infull.    On the 9th July the Persian Government informed the Secretary-General of the United Nat ions that they rejected the Court&apos;s Order.Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Missionij. On the 8th July the President of the United States offered to sendMr. Averell Harriman to Persia to discuss the situation with Dr. Miusaddiq,at the same time drawing attention to the International Court!s Oi-der and urging the Persian Government to treat it with all possible consideration.Mr. Harriman arrived in Tehran on the 15th July.   In the course of discussions with Dr. Musaddiq he eventually on the 24th July persuadedthe Persians to agree to open negotiating iat ions with the 3ritish Government onthe basis of the following formula:-&quot;In the case of the British Government, on behalf of the formerAnglo-Iranian Oil Company, recognising the principle of the nationalisation of the oil industry in Persia, the Persian Govern-ment would be prepared to enter into negotiations withrepresentatives of the British Government on behalf of the formerCompany, &quot;While this formula seemed to offer a chance for negotiations, HisMajesty&apos;s Government considered that it was unlikely that the negotiations would be fruitful unless the Persian Government first undertook to improve the conditions in South Persia which had deteriorated throughout the monthof july.-4* A point had been reached by the middle of July at which it hadbeen decided to withdraw the staff from the oilfields of Abadan, but thedecision was suspended in deference to Mr.  Harriman&apos;s views, as he considered that to do so would prejudice his chances of openingnegotiations.    Production at the refinery gradually decreased until on31 st July it ceased to operate because the storage tanks were full.    On the30th July the Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons that although there might have to be a withdrawal from the oil wells and from some parts of Abadan, it was His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention not to evacuateAbadan entirely.   In confirming this statement in the House of Lords theLord Chancellor added that His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted all the implications that  fol low from the decision.   As a precautionary measure the Persian Gulf Squadron of three frigates was reinforced by four destroyersfrom the Mediterranean.-5. Meanwhile Mr. Harri man deci ded to fly to London to discuss thesituation with His Majesty&apos;s Government and on his return, after furthertalks with Dr. Musaddiq, he was able to assure His Maj esty1 sGovernment that the Persian Government recognised the necessity for improving the atmosphere, particularly in South Persia, and that the
Persian Government had agreed to negotiate on the basis of the Law of20th March, 1951 (paragraph 19) and would not insist on the applicationof the National isat ion Law of 1st May (paragraph 20),   It has subsequentlybecome apparent from a speech of Dr. Musaddiq in the Maj lis on 9th September that he only agreed to this formula because he was sure that negotiations would lead to no result.3 I. After receiving these assurances, His Maj esty&apos;s Governmentaddressed to the Persian Government a note to which Mr. Harriman had agreed after consulting Dr. Musaddiq.   This note accepted the formulamentioned in paragraph 3 5 above and pointed out that the negotiations could not be conducted in a satisfactory manner unless the presentatmosphere was relieved.   The note recognised on behalf of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and of the Company the principle of the nationalisation of the oil industry in Persia.    In their reply the Persian Government for their part recognised the need for creating the best possible atmosphere in theinterests of the success of the negotiations.    His Maj esty&apos;s Governmentsmission, headed by Mr. Stokes, the Lord Privy Seal, left for Persia on 3rd August.The 8-Point Proposal si?, Mr,  Harriman and his advisers had endeavoured to prepare the way for the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Mission by impressing upon the Persianstheir inability to market their own oil and appeared to have achievedsome success.    It was clear from the prel iminary conversations that the persians were awaiting a lead from the mission,    Mr.  Stokes therefore decided to put forward proposals (See Annex A) which, while offering the persians nat ional isat ion and the withdrawal of A.I.O.C. as such from persia, were designed to ensure (a) efficient product ion of the oil,(b) a large off take of oil, and (c) availability of a large quantity of oil to those British interests which have developed it.   For the purpose of (a)it was essential to retain the British technical staff and to have a soundoperating organisation, substantially under British control, in which theBritish technical staff could have confidence,38, These proposals which were made on the 13th August have become known as the &quot;8&quot;Point proposal s&quot;.   While details of this scheme were subject to negotiation, it represented in broad outline the maximum con&quot;cession to Persian demands consistent with a business-like solution ofthe problem.39. The Persian Government refused to discuss these proposals butissued a statement in which they announced, quite wrongly, that  theproposals did not conform to the formula on the basis of which negotiations had been begun.    They contended that, according to this formula, the onlyproblems which could be discussed were:-(a) The purchase of oil to meet the United Kingdom&apos;s own requirements.(b) Examination of the compensation to be paid to the A.I.O.C,(c) The employment of British technicians by the N.I.O.C,To confine the discussion to these three points meant in effect a reversion to the terms of the oil nationalisation law of 1st May, which we had made clear we could not accept as a basis for discussions.
40. During private negotiations with Mr. Stokes, Dr. Musaddiqappeared ready to discuss the formation of a purchasing organisation, buthe insisted that the British and Persian staff in the industry should beemployed under a direct contract with the M.I.O.C., and that there was,therefore, no room for the operating organisat ion.   In an attempt to obtain agreement at least on this one essential point, the Lord Privy Seal, afterwithdrawing his 8-Point proposal s, explored various other ways of retainingBritish management.   It soon became clear that Dr. Musaddiq was notprepared to accept any of these and the Lord Privy Seal therefore decided to suspend negotiations and left for London on 23rd August.Mr. Harriman left two days later.Events after the return of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s Miission. With the withdrawal of the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s mission and ofMr. Harriman from Tehran, His Majesty&apos;s Government let it be known that they regarded the negotiations as suspended.    It was hoped that dr. Musaddiq woul d realise that he could not induce us to yield to hisdemands and that, if he wished for a solut ion which would enable the flow ofoi 1 from Persia to be resumed, he would have to come forward withconstructive proposal s on which negotiations could be resumed.    In theevent, finding himself under increasing at tack from Opposition circlesfor failing to produce a solution of the oil dispute which would give Persia 30, 000 a day (a sum he had often quoted in the past) and no doubt impelledto further action by the more extreme members of his entourage, Dr.Musaddiq in the course of an unusual ly intransi gent speech in the Senate on 5th September, stated that if His Maj esty&apos;s Government did not return asatisfactory answer within two weeks to his latest &quot;proposals&quot; the residencepermits of the A.I.O.C. staff in Persia would be cancelled.    In the face ofthis &quot;ultimatum&quot;, and in order to st rengthen the hands of those deputies inthe Majlis who were showing opposition to Mlusaddiq, it was considered essential to make it clear to the Persian deputies and people that HisMajesty&apos;s Government had abandoned hope of being able to reach a settle-ment with him, the imply modifications ion being that if the Persians wanted a settlementit was for them to withdraw thei r confidence in Musaddiq and ensure his resignation.   His Majesty&apos;s Government therefore announced on theit h September that they regarded the negotiating iat ions bet ween themselves andthe Persian Government as definitely broken off.42. It was decided on the 10th September to withdraw certain specialbenefits which had previously been given to Persia in view of the advantages to the United Kingdom economy deriving from Persian oil supplies.    these measures, which were designed to protect the United Kingdom economy andwere not retaliatory,limited Persia&apos;s facilities in the use of sterling andthe purchase of certain scarce goods.   As a corollary cargoes of scarce goodsen route to Persia, amounting to 3,000 tons of railway track equipment and3,000 tons of sugar, were requisitioned.    The Persian Governments riposte tothese measures was to withdraw permission from the British Bank of iran and the Middle East to deal in foreign exchange.43, Meanwhile, the A.I.O.C, had decided, with His Majesty&apos;s Governmentsapproval, to cease paying their Persian staff in Abadan, save for some 7,000workers who will be engaged on maintenance and other essential services, atthe end of September,44, In the bel ief that the Shah al one is capable of repl aci ng Musaddiqwith a more reasonable government with which we can negotiate,H,M, Ambassador at Tehran, under instructions, had an audience of the shah on the 11th September, in which he reaffirmed His Majesty&apos;s&quot;lO&quot;&quot;
belief that nothing was to be hoped for from the present Persian Govern-ment, and strongly urged that His Majesty should take steps to replace thepresent government with one better fitted to safeguard the country1 s realinterest s.45. On the 12th September Dr. Musaddiq sent Mr. Karriman, for communication to His Majesty&apos;s Government, what he described as new proposals for the settlement of the oil dispute, which included the&quot;ultimatum&quot; in regard to the British staff referred to in paragraph 41above.    Mr. Harriman refused to pass on this communi cat ion, and in a firmreply pointcd out that the so-called proposals were in some respects aretrogressi on from the attitude which Dr. Musaddiq had previous ousl y taken up, and that the issue of the &quot;ultimatum&quot; in regard to the British staff couldonly aggravate the situation.4 :.. The Shah, in a further conversation with Sir F. Shepherd on thel?th September, appeared more frightened of making a change ofgovernment than of letting Dr. Musaddiq remain in power, and thereforeurged Sir F. Shepherd to have further discussions with Dr. Musaddiq, which sir F. Shepherd declined to do.    On the 19th September, as a result ofthis conversation, the Minister of Court brought H. M, Ambassador anunsigned and undated piece of paper, apparently emanating from Dr. Musaddiq,containing further suggestions for a settlement.   These suggestionsrepresented a si ight advance on Dr. Musaddiq&apos;s previous offers, but were still wholly unsatisfactory in regard to the al 1-import ant quest ion of theposition of the British staff.   Since it appeared that Dr. Musaddiq&apos;principal object in putting forward these suggestions was to be able to say we the Majlis on the 23rd September that he was in negotiation with HisMajesty&apos;s Government on the oil issue, His Majesty&apos;s Government at onceannounced that the proposals were unacceptable as a basis for negotiation.47. On the 25th September the Persian Government announced, withoutany not ifi cat ion to His Majesty&apos;s Government, that the remaining british staff in Abadan would be given seven days&apos;  notice in which to quit thecountry.    This step represented a final flouting by Dr. Musaddiq of the interim deci sion of the Hague Court and, unless rescinded, would clearly render far more difficult a solution of the dispute and would therefore hasten the economic collapse of Persia.H.

OUTLINE OF SUGGESTIONS SUBMITTED TO THE PERSIANDELEGATION ON 13TH AUGUST,  1951  BY THE british delegation WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO ANY PARTYCONCERNED1.     A.I.O.C. will transfer to N.I.O.C. the whole of itsinstallations, machinery, plant and stores in Iran.    Asregards the assets in southern Iran compensation hyN.I.O.C. to A.I.O.C. would be included in the operating costs of the oil industry in the area.    Compensation forthe assets used in the past for distribution and marketing in Iran will be dealt with under the separatearrangements suggested in paragraph 7 below.2.     A Purchasing Organisation will be formed in order toprovide the assured outlet for Iranian oil which is theonly basis upon which an oil industry of the magnitude of that of Iran could hope to maintain itself.    Thiswill be done by means of a long term contract, say25 years, with N.I.O.C. for the purchase f.o.b. of verylarge quantities of crude oil and products from southern Iran.3.     Apart from this arrangement N.I.O.C. would be ableto make additional sale of oil subject to the normal commercial provision that such sales should be effected in such a way as not to prejudice the interests of the purchasing Organisation,1+.      The Purchasing Organisation under the agreement willbe placing at the disposal of the N.I.O.C.  a world-widetransportation and marketing service, including one ofthe largest tanker fleets in the world, and will beentering into firm commitments with its customers forthe fulfilment of which it will be relying on iranian oil.    It will, therefore, as a matter of normal commercialpractice, have to assure itself that oil in the necessaryquantities and qualities v/ill come forward at the timesrequired.    In order to secure this objective the purchasing Organisation will agree with N.I.O.C.  an organisation which, under the authority of N.I.O.C. willmanage on behalf of N.I.O.C. the operations of searchingfor, producing, transporting, refining and loading oilwithin the area.    The Purchasing Organisation will arrangefrom current proceeds the finance necessary to coveroperating expenses.5.      In order that the proposed Purchasing Organisationcon be induced to commit itself to the purchase of largequantities of Iranian oil over a long period of years,the commercial terms must be not loss advantageous thanthe Purchasing Organisation would secure elsewhereeither by purchase or development.    In. effect this means that the Purchasing Organisation v/ould buy the oil from.I.O.C. at commercial prices f.o.b. Iran less a pricediscount equal in the aggregate to the profit remainingto N.I.O.C. after allowing for the discount and for the costs of making the oil available to the PurchasingOrganisation.ANNEX A
6.     In tho event of the foregoing suggestions being accepted by the Iranian Government as a basis for thofuture operation of the oil industry in southern Iranit is suggested that they should be expanded into the heads of an Agreement which could later be developedinto a detailed purchasing arrangement between the iranian Government and the proposed PurchasingOrganisation.    The Heads of Agreement would also providefor the immediate resumption of operations in southernIran on on interim basis.7.     It is suggested that all the assets owned by theKermanshah Petroleum Company Limited which producesand refines oil for consumption in Iran, together withthe installations, machinery, plant and moveablo assets of A.I.O.C. which have been used In the past for distribution and marketing of refined products withinIran, should be transferred to the Iranian Government ohfavourable terms.8,     There will be Iranian representation on theboard of directors (or its equivalent) of the OperatingOrganisation, which will, of course, only employnon-Iranian staff to the extent that it finds it necessaryto do so for the efficiency of its operations.    It willalso offer its full co-operation to N.I.0.C, in anyprogramme of training on whioh the latter may wish to embark.NEWS DEPARTMENT16th August. 1951 .-2-
