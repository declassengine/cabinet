IIS  DOCUMENT  IS THE  PROPERTY  OF  HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1951CONFIDENTIALCP. (51) 2373rd September, 1951CABINETTHE MAN-POWER POSITION ON THE BRITISH RAILWAYSMemorandum by the Minister of transport at its meeting on 26th July the Cabinet invited the Minister of Defence toarrange for officials to examine urgently the proposals which I put to them in my paper CP. (51) 215 of 19th July, that, as an alternative to deferment, railwaymencalled up for National Service should, after basic training, be returned to therailways on reserve (CM. (51) 55th Conclusions, Minute 5).2. This examination has now taken place and I understand that these pro-posals are unacceptable to the Service departments, partly because existing trainingresources are inadequate for the purpose and partly because the training period,if it were long enough to be of any value to the Services would be too long to enableany substantial help to be given to the railways. I understand that, in fact, theServices would regard this alternative to deferment as worse than deferment itself,and that the Ministry of Labour and National Service do not consider that it offersadvantages over deferment in meeting their particular difficulties.3. I must therefore ask my colleagues to give further consideration to my request for a limited measure of deferment as set out in my previous paper. Thetotal number for whom deferment is thus sought is about 2,900. When I submittedmy previous memorandum this was made up of firemen (1,162), the promotiongrades for firemen, guards, shunters and signalmen (1,645) and permanent-way,signal and telegraph maintenance staff (69). These figures will have altered slightlysince then, but remain of the same order.4. My Department have examined in detail with the British Transport Corn-mission and the Railway Executive the prospects of keeping traffic moving on therailways this winter, and the position is serious. The number of vacancies in therailway footplate staff in areas of acute shortage have increased from over 3,800at the beginning of the year to over 4,700 at the end of June. There is no reasonto expect any improvement in ratio of staff recruitment to wastage during theautumn and winter when working conditions worsen. At the end of June, 225booked freight trains were cancelled daily because of staff shortages, and work inthe marshalling yards was seriously slowed down by lack of crews for shuntingengines.5. In consultation with the National Coal Board, the railways have planned for a maximum diversion of coal to road and coastal shipping, but even so, they expect to have to move an additional million tons of coal alone in the 16 weeksbeginning 10th September.  There are increases to be expected in other traffics.6. The Railway Executive are planning cuts in passenger services of varyingorders of severity. These cuts are, of course, useless unless they throw up menwho can be used in the areas of traffic congestion, and they must therefore be planned with care if useless injury to the country&apos;s travel is to be avoided.7. If no relief can be given from their man-power obligations to the Services,the Railways will have no alternative but to cut passenger services to a standardgenerally below that obtaining during last winter&apos;s coal shortage. In addition, theywould find it impossible to run some 500 to 600 freight trains (including empties)4116131
of those they expect to be required daily for the autumn and winter traffic. Ifpriority is to be given to coal, this would mean shutting out some   million tonsof other.traffic each week. Such a position is, of course, untenable. No absolute priority could be given to coal, and the accumulation of traffic at this rate wouldhave a disastrous effect upon the country&apos;s economy.8. I am satisfied, and I think the Minister of Labour and National service will support me, that the Railways are doing all they can to meet their difficultiesfrom their own resources. It is unnecessary to recapitulate their difficulties. I am bound to say that I do not think they are getting all the help they should fromthe Unions, but even if the latter could be brought to agree to a more efficient useof footplate staff, it would not go very far to meet current difficulties.9. If a breakdown this winter is to be avoided, I can see no alternative butto agree that the Railways should be allowed to retain the men they have in theareas where they are so short. This will do something to alleviate matters, and,in conjunction with the special measures which the Railways are themselves taking,will, I hope, prevent acute trouble. Serious operating difficulties will undoubtedlyremain and a long-term solution of the man-power problem has yet to be found.A. B.Ministry of Transport, W. 1,3rd September, 1951.r
