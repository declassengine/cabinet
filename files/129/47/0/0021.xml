^---DOCUMENT is-THE ?.RG?recommendation-;&quot;- OF his- SRITANNI-G MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENTPNFIDENTIALc.p. (51) 246 ccp . ncv13th CEPTEMjER, 1951cabinetTHE COAL TRANSPORT situation memorandum by t ;.e Minister of Fuel and power the memorandum oy t. e Minister of Transport (C.P.(5l) 237)reveals a most disturbing prospect.   V/iti the present shortage of manpoweron the railways, it seems more than lilely that the transport facilities ofthe country will .e unable to move the whole of the coal output.    Indeed, ashortage of wagons at the pits is already appearing.   Since the resumption ofSaturda   working, certain pits in the East and West Midlands and inScotland have onl. had sufficient wagons at the beginning of the day tocover the requirements of the morning shift, and, in one or two cases,not even that.2. In view of the difficulties experienced last winter - difficulties whichcontinued, contrary to all previous experience,through the spring and intothe summer - and of repeated warnings .y the railways that the position,short of remedial action, would worsen during the coming autumn and winter,arrangements were made some time ago to increase the transport of coaloy road, canal and sea.    But I am afraid the/ will be nothing more than apalliative;  the :ulk of the coal must be carried by rail, and the rootproblem of ensuring sufficient rail transport remains.3, Although I have not received all the material needed for drawing upnext winter&apos;s coal budget, it is already clear that we shall have difficultyboth in meeting essential requirements at home and in maintaining exportsat the level laid down by the Production Committee earlier in the year.   Weshall also have acute difficulty in providing the large coal required by the gas works and to the domestic consumer;  the stocks of these consumersare now well below the target level.4, It follows that, if a major b reakdown in distribution affecting bothindustry and the domestic consumer is to be avoided, rail transport facilities must be such as to ensure that all the coal produced is movedpromptly to its destination.5, The effect of a shortage of transport on the miner himself must notbe overlooked.   It would be disastrous if the men were to find, in responding to the appeals which have been made to them for more output, that coal hadto be placed on the ground, or, worse still, that pits were brought to a stop forwant of transport for the coal.6, 3y co-operation between the railway/ Executive and the National coal board much has been done not only to transfer traffic from rail to other forms of transport but also to reduce the burden on the railways by there-routing of&apos;traffic, by the make-up of through trains (so as to avoid-1-
marshalling and shunting at congested junctions).   But, as the Ministerof Transport indicates in C.P. (51) 237, this will not be enough, and indeed the National Coal Board have been clearly warned by the Railway Executivewith whom they are in daily contact on these matters, that even when allthese steps have been taken they think it unlikely, unless the staff positionis improved, that the railways will be able to carry the usual proportionof the coal output.7. I am, therefore, alarmed by the Minister of Transportsstatement in paragraph 4 of C.P. (51) 237 that there is no reason to expect any improvement in ratio of staff recruitment to wastage during theautumn and winter when working conditions worsen.   In the light of this and the other considerations I have given, I have no alternative but to urge my colleagues to support the Minister of Transport in taking whatevermeasures will effectively increase the man-power on the railways duringthe coming winter months.P.J. N-3.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S. W. 1. ,13TH SEPTEMBER, 1951.
