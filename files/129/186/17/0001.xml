document IS THE PROPER.TY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(73) 142 COPY NO 813 December 1975CABINETCHRYSLERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland. The Secretary of State for Industry has circulated a memorandum(C(75) 139) recommending inter alia that the Government should not accept responsibility for any part of the Chrysler UK operation but should make clear that full responsibility for liquidating it lies with the chrysler corporation.    I should like to comment on the points made in the Secretaryof State for Industry!s memorandum,,A REDUCED CHRYSLER UK OPERATION SCHEME B2, The memorandum states that &quot;Coopers and Lybrand conclude that scheme B is not viable&quot;.    While making reservations about the Chryslerfigures, Cooper and Lybrands do not say specifically in Annex A(i) toC(75) 139 that Scheme B is not viable0    What Coopers have done howeveris to confirm the figure of  96 million as the cash required by the new company under Scheme B,    This is the same figure as I put forward tocolleagues in the Annex to my note C(75) 129.    In fact with a Chryslercontribution of  35 million and the consequent saving of interest the figurebecomes  80 million and the contribution required from Government is 45 million which is considerably less than the  140- 150 millionoriginally envisaged.    C(75) 139 mentions a figure of  115 million but I donot accept that one can lump together new capital and loan guarantees justlike that.3. Nor do I accept the conclusion in paragraph 6 of C(75) 139 thatAnnex A(ii) shows that the Chrysler Corporation are not committed to theUnited Kingdom operation.    The annex was not intended to be a legally binding document but only to illustrate the kind of commitments that the chrysler Corporation were prepared to enter into.    Scottish Officeofficials did in fact suggest to other Departments that an effort should bemade to pin down the Chrysler Corporation in a more detailed agreement.It has certainly always been my intention that the Chrysler corporation should be so locked in to the future operations of the new company and Ihave always favoured a contract with the Chrysler Corporation which would
have incentives built in to ensure that the commitment to the new operation will be sustained.    The Chrysler Corporation^ willingness to be committed to the new company was reaffirmed strongly yesterday by Messrs Riccardoand Cafiero whilst they were beihig intransigent on the actual financial contribution they were prepared to make to the new operation.    Mr Cafierodid in fact emphasise to the Central Policy Review Staff yesterday eveningthat the Chrysler Corporation envisaged the new operation being fullyintegrated with the Chrysler Corporation worldwide from the operationalpoint of view.    This means that the viability of the new United Kingdomoperation cannot be assessed in isolation,    And the question of finance for new model development in the 1980s must depend on how the arrangementswork between now and then,POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF BRITISH LEYLAND AND IMPACT on united KINGDOM CAR MAKERS4. I am not at all surprised at the reactions of the other motorcompanies to a rescue bid for Chrysler UK.    It obviously must be in their interests to have the United Kingdom-based competition reduced,    I amparticularly sceptical of the views of Ford and VauxhalL    I am alsosceptical of the possibilities of British Leyland taking over the Iraniancontract.    All the indications from the discussions with the chrysler corporation at Ministerial and official level are that if Chrysler UK is allowed to go, the Iranian contract will be secured from elsewhere in the chrysler Corporation organisation,VIEWS OF TRADE UNIONS5. If the view of the four trade unionists mentioned in paragraph 8 ofC(75) 139 is correct then this could be a telling factor,    But no scottish office Minister or official was present at the meeting and I do not know how the proposition was put to the trade unionists.    From my knowledge of thesituation at Linwood however and of the views of the Scottish Trades UnionCongress (TUC) I do not believe that the views expressed byMr Lionel Murray and his colleagues are realistic.    It is significant that not one of these trade unionists was Scottish-based.    I do not believe thatthe Linwood and Midlands workers would take the intransigent attitudeattributed to them if the full facts were put before them ie either a slimmeddown version of Chrysler UK with 15, 000 workers or no jobs at all either inthe Midlands or at Linwood.    Moreover there would be little prospect of thescheme being thwarted by a sit-in or work-in at Ryton because I understandthat very little equipment would be moved from there to Linwood and itcould be provided at Linwood ab initio at between  1 million and  2 million.Incidentally this must be one of the few occasions where it is proposed totransfer work from England to Scotland.    The reverse is happeningregularly and there is no sign of workers in the south showing support fortheir Scottish colleagues.    This has caused considerable bitterness inScotland in the past.    As for the TUC idea for a 40-hour wage for six
months, this v/ould be considerably more costly than the specialredundancy payments scheme already discussed by Ministers,    It is not clear where the alternative jobs are to come from.    If we had had6, 000-plus jobs waiting to be proposed in the Linwood area we would dothese anyway.    And of course in six months the car capacity would have gone forever or would have been taken over by foreigners.    Nevertheless,if Scheme B were to bo adopted I believe the Government should take some special steps to find alternative employment for the workers declaredredundant at Ryton.CONSEQUENCES OF CHRYSLER UK BEING LIQUIDATED6. i. For Her Majesty&apos;s GovernmentI have not yet seen the Secretary of State for Employments paperbut I understand that it will include figures which will show that onthe assumption that 55,000 jobs (mostly male) were lost as a resultof the Chrysler shut-down and the loss persisted for a year the loss in terms of public expenditure would be  150 million ( 180 million ifa special redundancy scheme were added).    Even if job losses were reduced to 30, 000 the annual figure would still be  115 million.Either of these figures is considerably higher than the  45 millionwe are being asked to find to keep the company producing cars and maintaining jobs.    Whilst in human terms I have a good deal of sympathy for the views of the Secretary of State for Employment onthe need for a special redundancy scheme, I believe that such ascheme for the Chrysler workers could be very badly received byother trade unionists who will not understand why these highly-paidmotor company workers are receiving special treatment.    And ofcourse it will be wasteful because the Department of Employmentforecast that Chrysler skilled workers will soon find jobs at theexpense of other less fortunate workers in the Midlands and aroundLinwood,ii.        For the Chrysler CorporationJust how cheaply the Chrysler Corporation is likely to get out of Chrysler UK by a once-for-all payment of  35 million is not certain,since the Chrysler Corporation have not been prepared to discussthe figures and Mr Riccardo indicated at the meeting with the officials on Tuesday 2 December that the figures on which theGovernment were working were wrong.    However, if it is true thatChrysler would find difficulty in extricating itself in a liquidationsituation, this might influence its decision to pay off all creditors orcertainly the timing of such payments.    This could lead to pressure on the Government by creditors such as component manufacturers and dealers for assistance as happened in similar circumstanceswith Rolls-Royce,
OTHER FACTORS7. In his paper the Secretary of State for Industry ignores theconsequences for the balance of payments and Anglo/Iranian trade relations of allowing Chrysler UK to go.    The only hope of retaining the iranian contract is if the British Leyland were to obtain it but I havealready indicated above that in my view this is a remote possibility,conclusion. The Secretary of State for Industry says that the odium for the liquidation of Chrysler UK should rest on the Chrysler Corporation.    Ibelieve that the odium would be shared by the Government when it became known, as it undoubtedly would, that the Chrysler Corporation wereprepared to contribute  35 million to the company which would have beenable to continue with an injection of Government money amounting to 45 million - less than half the amount to be spent on unemploymentbenefits, social security and redundancy payments if Chrysler is allowedto go.    I submit to colleagues that this is a package whose rejection couldnot easily be defended amongst our supporters in the country or generally,certainly not in Scotland.    Colleagues will have already recognised thatthe reaction in Scotland to the Devolution White Paper was extremely badfrom the Government1 s point of view.    Most of the commentators attacked the lack of powers of the Scottish Assembly in the field of industrial and commercial policy.    If Linwood is allowed to go to the wall it will confirmcompletely and promptly the views of so many people in Scotland thatScottish industrial interests can only be looked after if these powers aretransferred to Scotland.9. I therefore recommend that the Government should:-i. Agree to Scheme B and accept the Chrysler offer of a grant towards the new company of  35 million.ii. Initiate further discussions with the trade unions at national level on a more representative basis.iii. Negotiate a tight management agreement with Chryslerswhich should if possible include incentives which would help to lockin the Chrysler Corporation to the new operation.viv. Consider urgently what alternative work might be found forthe workers declared redundant at Ryton.W RScottish Office3 December 1975 4
