[S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 12921 November 1975CABINETCHRYSLERNote by the Secretary of State for scotland i attach a note setting out a possible scheme for a scaled-downcontinuation of production by Chrysler which I have previously circulatedto the Ministerial Group.    In view of the disastrous employmentconsequences of closure for Linwood and for other areas with majorChrysler factories, and the wider political considerations which arise, Iconsider it to be most important that this proposition be formally put toChrysler and clear answer sought on whether it could be negotiable onacceptable terms.    I consider therefore that this paper should be taken intoaccount by the Cabinet in reaching a conclusion.W R Copy NO31Scottish Office21 November 1975
1.     The Secretary of State for Industry in his paperMISC59(75)24 lists five options (paragraph 17).   I agreethat these are the options at present hut I do not agreewith his conclusion that we should accept option (v) -complete closure. .. i :2.     In my view the social and. political consequences of complete closure are so severe, indeed disastrous thatthey should he avoided if at all possible.   On the otherhand, a complete takeover on.the-previous Chryslerproposals, option (i), would be very expensive and have serious disadvantages.   A solution involving only themaintenance of the Iranian contract, option (iv), seemsto me to be virtually impossible to. achieve and also very. expensive. .   .. - : :v&apos;-&quot; - - ^ -&apos;- &apos;       /!.3.   . From my point .of view, the Linwood rescue solution -option (iii.) - has oVvious attractions.:- But Chrysler saythat it makes little industrial sense, it would involve considerable disruption and the prospects of obtaining the necessary cooperation of the English workforce mustbe poor.   While. I -;ould.-be prepared to argue, and doargue, the&apos; special problems of. the Linwood area, therewould clearly be political difficulties in so patentlysacrificing the interests of part of the English workforce
SECRETin favour of Linwood and in the current political context of devolution.   The dangers of an English backlash could go well beyond the Chrysler situation.4. My strong preference is for a wider solution and Ibelieve that the new Chrysler proposals - option (ii) -provide a basis for that.5.     This scheme is much less costly than Chrysler&apos;original proposals; it is a coherent scheme worked out byChrysler themselves..and believed by them to be viable; itreduces the number of redundancies to a more manageablelevel but involves a substantial slimming down of the chrysler operation.   It is sufficiently attractive forIDAB to have divided evenly on it, 4-4, at their meetingon 19 November.6.     A basic question is whether Chrysler corporation would be willing to participate by contributingfinancially..   If they were, the scheme would of course bemuch more attractive, including to IDAB who I assume musthave taken their decision on the basis that there was noChrysler. financial commitment to the scheme.7.&apos;    The Secretary of State for Industry admits(paragraph 6 of his paper) that the extent to whichChrysler Corporation might be willing to contribute hasnot been fully explored with them, but that they have notruled out a financial contribution.   I suggest that thismatter should now be explored urgently.   The most likelybasis of an agreement would be that Chrysler Corporationretained a 20 per cent interesto8.     I believe that there is a very good chance of chrysler corporation cooperating on that basis *   I take this viewbecause, although Mr Eiccardo in his initial meetings with ministers gave the impression that a Chrysler withdrawal from the UK would cost the Chrysler Corporation virtuallynothing because of US tax reliefs among other factors,later information suggests that that is not so.   Forexamp] e Chrysler Corporation have guaranteed bankfacilities to Chrysler UK to the extent of  45m.   Therewill be need for new money for redundancy payments whichthey have said they would hon:urv and for the payment ofcreditors in full, which again they have committed themselvesto.   All this must represent a substantial net cost toChrysler Corporation. . oi-j .
9,     The essentials of a scheme would he:(a) That the Government did not pay off in anyway the losses already incurred hy Chrysler UK.(h)   That there was a continuing commitment byChrysler Corporation so.that the UK company wouldhave access to their wider international operations and(c)   that the Government would have effective control of Chrysler UK consistent with its 80 percent stake.10o   In the Annex, I have sketched out what a scheme onthis basis might look like.    It involves capitalisingChrysler Corporation loans and advances to Chrysler UK,the Government buying 80 per cent of the increasedcapital for the nominal sum of  1, a further capitalissue of  95m to be contributed as to 80 per cent by theGovernment and 20 per cent by the Chrysler Corporation,,11.   Prom the Chrysler Corporation point of view, theunattractive feature of the scheme would be the new capital contribution of  19m, but on the other hand therewould be a saving of the new money they are likely tohave to bring in to meet redundancy payments etc in theevent of a complete closure and they would retain the taxadvantages which they say would flow to them in the UnitedStates from a reduction in their stake in Chrysler UK to20 per cent.12.   Prom the Government&apos;s point of yiew, the financial contribution is reduced to  71m.    ( 76m share capital loss 5m Department of Industry loan repaid), so that thiswould be a much less costly package than the originalChrysler Corporation proposals.   Moreover, even if in thenew circumstances we proceeded with a special redundancyscheme, the number of workers involved would be much lass and the cost considerably reduced.    Talcing account of savings in unemployment pay etc the net cost to theGovernment would be very much less than  71m.13.   A solution of this sort would(a) avoid the worst social and political consequencesthat would arise from a complete closure.(b) maintain Chrysler UK! as a *net earner of foreign currency at balance of payments benefits ranging from 131m in 1976 to  207m in 1979-
(c)   Avoid the danger that the loss of Chrysler cr-c.production would mean an increase in foreign importsif only because Chrysler dealers who lost their business would have nowhere else to turn but foreignimporters.,    (A scheme of import controls could ofcourse still be introduced as there are strong arguments for that even with a reduced Chryslerrundown).14.  --The cooperation of the workforce would be essentialboth m the immediate period of redundancies and in the longer term but I believe that we would have an excellentprospect of Trade Union   cooperation.   The scheme wouldinvolve public ownership, the existing shares would havebeen taken over for a nominal sum, the Unions are in any casexpecting larger redundancies and they will accept that thealternative to a scheme such as that now proposed would be complete closure. -15*     Many details would have tote worked out&apos; in negotiation, and I would wish us to enter into thenegotiations with Chrysler Corporation with the determina-tion to get the best bargain possible for the Government.On that basis, I recommend that we should urgently discuss with Chrysler Corporation a. scheme on the lines I have described in this paper, which I believe would be viableand is by far the best solution in all the circumstances.

The forecast profits will then be:-1976  (38)m1977 6.8m1978 7.2m1979 7.1m (l6.9)mNote:   These figures have been increased (the 1976 loss reduced)compared with the figures in the Department of Industrypaper by adding back interest charged on part of the new capital.E.     The total capital requirement will then be:-Capital expenditure 1976/79  63.^111Losses 1976/79 16.9m 80.3mThis would be more than adequately covered by the share issue of 95m plus the sale proceeds, if any, of Eyton.SECRET
