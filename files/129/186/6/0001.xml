CHRYSLER (UK)  : SCHEME FOR IMPORT RESTRICTIONSNote by officials        The table at Annex 1 shows the existing pattern of importsof passenger cars.     This reflects the fact that very competitivesmaller cars are available from a wide range of countries.     Itis clear therefore that any scheme designed to transfer lostChrysler (UK) production to other British makers will have tocover imports from all sources, including the e.c..     In formulatingthis scheme we have taken account of our international obligations and the likely reactions of competitor countries.     Clearly the closer the scheme is tailored to the announced objective of therestrictions the more chance there is of avoiding undesirableinternational repercussions.OUTLINE OF THE SCHEME2       We are still working out the details of the scheme but themain issues that arise are as follows:-a       The period of the scheme from the point of view of inducing British customersto buy British, the longer the period of restraintthe greater the incentive - because more Britishmade models (eg the Ford Bobcat) will become avail-able and, because the scope for postponing a purchasealtogether until foreign cars are freely availableonce again is reduced.     Another objective of thescheme discussed by Ministers is that the dealernetwork that will be left unemployed by withdrawalof Chrysler should either go out of business or betaken up by British manufacturers.     In practiceBritish manufacturers themselves are trying to reduce their dealer network so that there is little chanceof many of the existing Chrysler distributors beingtaken up by British manufacturers.     It is difficultto assess how long a period of restraint would benecessary to deter foreign manufacturers from takingthem over, especially as motor makers take a longview in building their dealer networks.     But clearly the longer period during which the restraints at least&apos;appear possible, the greater the deterrent.It is however unrealistic to think that the scheme could last beyond the end of 1977 when the possibilityof.action against Community countries ceases to existunder the Treaty of Accession.     At the other extremethe period of restraint should clearly as a minimumcover the 1976 Spring and Summer sales season.     since we shall in any case need the authority of the european commission (see para 5 below) the best course seems tobe to go for a period of restraint terminating at theend of 1977 hut to be prepared to accept a schemeterminating in the middle of that year or, at worst,at the end of 1976.
CoverageChrysler&apos;s range of motor cars does not go above those with an engine capacity of 1725 cc.   Given the objectives of the scheme it would be sensible and internationallymore defensible to tailor the scheme to roughly the range which Chrysler produces.   The tendency of themarket at the moment is to trade down into smaller car sand it is in smaller cars that the British industry isroost uncompetitive.   For administrative reasons, it wouldbe far simpler to define the area restricted in terms ofexisting tariff subheadings.   This would mean including all car? with an engine capacity of up to 2200 cc (thenext lower cut off is at 1500 cc).   This solution, whichshould be internationally defensible   would in fact coverall but 20,000 (about 5%) of imported cars.Chrysler&apos;s proportion of UK production of commercial vehicles is about the same as in passenger cars.    Butthe UK commercial vehicle industry is generally muchmore competitive and supplies getting on for 90% of themarket, and could be expected in large measure to fill the gap left by Chrysler.   Chrysler&apos;s do not generallymake a car derived van - the area of commercial vehicleproduction that is most subject to growing competition from imports.   In this situation we do not think thatthere is a good case for restricting imports of commercial vehicles.Arrangements would need to be made to exempt imports of cars which form part of personal effpcts.   Customs   and excise are confident that it should be possible to prevent any significant abuse.Level of QuotasWf* have not been able to complete a full examination ofthe statistics but, given the stated objectives of thescheme, it would seem sensible to choose a relativelyrecent 12 months base period and make it clear thatimporters   will be allowed to import 100% of the importsmade during the 12 months base period but with some control to prevent importers loading too much of their quotasinto the main sales season.   If we chose a period from sayraid 1974- to mid 1975 (which could be presented internationallyas reasonable) this would produce total annual imports of430,000 cars, rather more than the low 1974 total but probably below the 1975 total. In practice, individual
concessionaires for each make would get a quota   based on theirmid 1974 - mid 1975 imports and we cannot rule out that if thisis especially unfavourable to a particular make, we shall be pressed to adopt a different base and we are almost certainlyto be pressed at some stage to allow a higher total of importsanyway.   This particular period would have most restrictiveeffects on Italy and to a lesser extent on Japan.3       One problem which will have to be considered is whether,given that Ford and Vauxhall are part of an European system ofmanufacture, they can in fact operate with quotas.   It seemsimpossible in practice to consult UK makers in advance aboutwhether they can live with our scheme but it may prove necessaryduring the course of the scheme to make adjustments to meet their particular requirements.h        A scheme along these   lines would require up to about 15 staff at a total cost of about  75,000 and could be introduced withink days of a firm and final Ministerial decision on the nature ofthe scheme (though a longer period would be needed if controls oncars were part of a wider package of import controls).INTERNATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS5       The most immediate and most difficult problem would be withthe Community,    The only provision under which we could impose restrictions on other Member States is Article 135 of the Treatyof Accession,     This provides that &quot;If, before 31 December 1977,difficulties arise which are serious and liable to persist in anysector of the economy or which could bring about serious deterioration in the economic situation of a given area, a new member-State may apply for authorisation to take protectivemeasures in order to rectify the situation and adjust the sectorconcerned to the economy of the common market.&quot;     There are twosignificant points about this provision.     The first is that itwould appear to set a final limit of end 1977 to any action taken.Secondly, we could only act with Commission authorisation and itis clear that this has to be advance authority;      there is no provision (as there is for measures to protect the balance ofpayments under Articles 108 and 109) under which we could actfirst arid seek authority afterwards.     If the Commission refuseauthority and we nonetheless impose restrictions, a very difficult situation could arise.   The Commission could take us to theEuropean Court and, if there were a ruling against us, ourlegal advice is that we would cease to have any basis under UKdomestic law to maintain the restrictions.    The full proceedingsof the European Court would take at least 6 months but there isa provision under which they could issue an interim j^dsca^nt whichwould require us to abandon the licensing measures until thefinal judgment was reached.   All this suggests first that theSECKET
Commission should be given as much advance warning aspossible (they are required under paragraph 2 of Article 135to give their determination &quot;Without delay&quot;) - we believethat, if they were given four days, this would be sufficientto enable them to take a decision;    secondly that a scheme should not be presented to them as an unalterable plan andthat we should be prepared to agree to modifications.6      In the very special circumstances created by thewithdrawal of Chrysler, we would expect difficulties with,but probably grudging acquiescence from, the Commission.The points on which we would expect them to concentrate arefirst the duration of the scheme (see para 2a   above) and secondly the need to keep the scheme only restrictive enoughto achieve the declared objective of preventing an increasein imports.7      One advantage of action under Article 135 is that, ifthe Commission did authorise action by us, we should be secureagainst retaliation by other Member States.     It is true that under paragraph k of Article 135 &quot;the Commission can authorise&quot;any original Member State&quot; to take protective measures against any new Member State;   but it is hardly conceivable that the Commission could authorise action which was inretaliation against measures which they had themselvesauthorised.8      The other important area internationally is the GATT.Eere we would have to invoke the provisions of Article   XIXfor &quot;emergencyaction on imports of particular products&quot; (theCommunity would have to invoke the provision on our behalf;on the assumption that we had the necessary Article 135clearance this should not be a problem).     Under this Articlewe have the right to take restrictive action if &quot;any productis being imported ...... in such increased quantities andunder such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic producers&quot;.     In contra-distinction to theposition under the Treaty of Accession, we can under the GATTact first and talk afterwards.     The Article is not a perfectfit for the circumstances.     Although imports this year are running at a higher rate than last yeatf, they are stillsubstantially below the 1973 level.     We would need to make as much as we could of the very special nature of thecircumstances involved, but we would still have a difficulttime and the possibility of direct retaliation by othercountries (in effect only Japan and Sweden since Communityretaliation is probably ruled out - see paragraph    7   above)cannot be excluded.    There is also a strong danger of encouraging protectionist action by the United States on cars(on which the US Treasury is currently investigating an anti-dumping application), or on other products.9      Two other international operations would be necessary.First, as a result of the new loan application it would be highly desirable to give the Fund 2 or 3 days advance notice.If the Commission have agreed to the scheme, with the implication of acquiescBnce by   other Member States representing a strong combined vote in the r&apos;und, then the scheme wouldprobably not jeopardise our borrowing application when it is
taken &quot;by the Fund Board, prohahly in December.    Secondly,as regards action against Sweden, the Community would need to invoke the relevant escape clause provision of theSweden/e.c. Agreement.     Under the latter, if the Swedes arenot satisfied,  they can take retaliatory action.10     It would finally be strongly desirable to give the mainindividual Governments (including the US) advance warning.To minimise risks or leakage this should only be done a halfday before the announcement.11     On the international front, the main timing problemsarise from Community considerations.     We have already suggested that k days should be allowed for discussion of,and agreement with, the Commission on the nature of thescheme.     Once this is agreed,  and Ministers have confirmedit, we need, as we have said, up to a further k days.     And,as already noted, the timing would be different if the schemewas combined with other selective restraints.CONCLUSION12     While more work is needed on the details (we have this is hand), the preceding paragraphs set out the broadlines of a scheme which would meet the remit set by ministers.   Any scheme to restrict imports of cars wouldbe strongly resisted internationally and we cannot guarantee that what is proposed would secure the necessary degree of acceptance or would avoid retaliation.   Looking at it,however, as a special single case, we would expect that we wouiiget this acceptance, though we might find it necessary to agreeto significant modifications, eg on the period for which therestrictions would be maintained.Department of trade Victoria Street11 November 1975TIMING

Memorandum by the Secretary of State for trade      In MISC 59(75)20 officials outline a scheme for restrictingimports of foreign cars designed to^ensure that the share of theBritish motor vehicles market currently held by Chrysler (UK)would be met by other British productiono     At MISC 59(75)8thofficials were instructed to&apos; develop the scheme further.2      In the.course of working out the scheme we have made estimates of the stocks available to British manufacturers and importers.The situation as we understand it is as follows.     At the end,of October BLMC had 30,000 finished cars available for salecompared with an ideal figure of 80,000-90,000 - they hope to reach a more desirable stock level by January.     Ford&apos;s stock levels of cars within.Chrysler&apos;s range are also low in particular ofthe Escort ,   for which there is an 8-week waiting period;    they hope to clear the backlog by Christmas.     Vauxhall have reasonablestocks.     Importers, we estimate, have a total of at least 150,000cars in stock;    this is roughly equivalent to k months imports.Y,:e do not know whether this is abnormally high.     We suspect thatit may be.     But the comparison with the stocks of British carscauses us to fear that however we restrict imports the stockalready in the country will enable foreign manufacturers at least to get a head start in the competition for Chrysler&apos;s&apos; market.3     In addition, although it is difficult to forecast the market for 1976, it is to be expected that the market will improve as theyear goes on.   There is thus a case for amending the scheme toprovide, as far as possible, for a substantial early impact withsome relaxation later in the year.k     I have examined the possibilities of basing a scheme onundertakings by the concessionaires of the various manufacturersthat they would restrict their sales in this country each quarterto 25% of their sales during the base period.     This v/ould ensurethat they did not use their more favourable stock position to pre-empt the market before British manufacturers were ready.      Such ascheme would, however, depend almost entirely on the voluntarycooperation of foreign manufacturers.     It v/ould not be enforceableand any breaches of the undertaking given could not be correcteduntil the damage had been done.     I have therefore concluded thatwe must stick with a quota restriction of imports along traditionallines.
5       I propose therefore to retain the sort of scheme proposedin MISC 59f75)20 hut to amend it in the following ways: -i)    I propose to take as the base period for the quotaApril 1974-March 1975.     This pushes the base periodhack one quarter.   The result is to reduce thetotal of    imported cars from 430,000 to 395,000.The difference of 35,000 is largely accounted for by reductions in the quotas of Japan (15.000), Prance (8,000),West Germany (8,000) and Italy (5,000).   On the otherhand the Dutch gain somewhat (4,000).   I would defendthis choice internationally by reference to the deterioration in the position of the British carindustry which resulted earlier in 1975 in an uncertainty about the future of BLMC which affected its market, andwhich had now been compounded by the collapse of. Chrysler,ii)   The normal pattern of imports is for 53$ to come induring the first half of the year and        in thesecond.   I propose that in our scheme the quota forthe first 6 monthly period should be UO% of the baseperiod;    and that for the second 6 monthly period 60%,This will mean that importers will be deprived of some40,000 cars for the Spring sales season.     This,together with the effect of reducing the total quota,,should go some way towards counteracting the imbalanceof stocks between British manufacturers and importers.6      The changes I have suggested above will undoubtedly makethe scheme more difficult to get through the Commission and todefend in GATT.     I think however that we have a reasonable publiccase for acting in this way.7      There is one caveat which I should make.     Even with the reductions I have suggested above, it is still possible that,even if import controls are introduced, the foreign registrationsduring the first few months of next year will continue to rise.This is because any import restriction scheme takes some time tohave effect.     We should, I think, guard against publicdisappointment by stating quite frankly at the beginning of thescheme that its impact may well not be immediately apparent butthat later in the year it will become more obvious.Con elusion8       If my colleagues agree, I will put in hand the finalpreparation of the scheme incorporating the changes I havesuggested above.Department of Trade f,5*19   November 1975
