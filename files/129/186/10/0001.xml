THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 13525 November 1975COLOUR TELEVISION TUBES:    THE CASE AGAINST IMPORT RESTRICTIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for TradeCOPY NO   o -*0 1CABINET1.   The minutes of the meeting of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy on 2l November record that &quot;the majority of the Committeefavoured no action on colour television tubes pending the outcome ofthe discussions now in train about the possible restructuring of theindustry and the future of the Thorn factory at Skelmersdale;   but theynoted that the Secretary of State for Industry might wish to bring this issue before Cabinet&quot;.   In this paper I set out the case against taking any decision now to impose controls on imports of colour television tubes.I fully support the objective of maintaining a British tube manufacturing capacity.   But I believe that for the television industry as a whole(sets and tubes) the imposition of import controls could well do more harm than good;   and that to take a decision at this stage in favour of import controls would be premature and unwise.2,   Although imports take about half the British market for colour television tubes, they have been falling rapidly in absolute termssince the depression in the television market started at the beginning of1974-   One reason for this high rate of import penetration is that only alimited range of tubes is available from the United Kingdom industry.As table (c) of the appendix demonstrates, there is-no significantUnited Kingdom production of the smaller sizes of tube (which account fora quarter of the market);   nor are many of the more technically advancedversions of the larger sizes (eg 110O in-line) available.   Thus there are substantial imports by the tube makers themselves to complement theirexisting ranges.   The result is that only about 20 per cent of importscompete directly with United Kingdom production.1
3.   Earlier this year, ny Department carried out a thorough investigation into allegations of dumping of TV tubes by the Japanese, but found no evidence to justify the imposition of anti-dumping duties.   However, duringray visit to Japan in September I obtained undertakings from the Japanesethat they would increase the prices of tubes exported to the United Kingdom-of types made in Britain closer to the&apos;point at which British manufacturers,raising their prices to the same level, could break even (for the type oftube primarily in question, an increase from between  31 and  32 to  38).Those undertakings are now being implemented and other importers appearto be following suit.    I have&apos;also announced our intention to introduceimport surveillance licensing, which would enable this arrangement to bemonitored closely.   Moreover, the British set-making industry have agreedto increase progressively the proportion of their purchases of tubes taken from the United Kingdom industry.   Import controls would put an end to both these arrangements.4.   The basic problem of the British tube industry is not so much thequantity of imports as the fact that overseas competition has prevented theUnited Kingdom manufacturers from increasing prices to cover higher costsaggravated by lower throughput.   As table (d) of the appendix demonstrates,at any likely level of demand, the United Kingdom industry&apos;s break-evenprices are likely to remain significantly above the international price level unless the increase in that price which I believe we have secured ismaintained.   The British television tube industry has an annual production capacity of about 2.5 million which is currently less than half utilised.To provide any worthwhile additional volume of business would require asavage cut in imports.5.   In practice, it would be virtually impossible to cut importssignificantly - particularly if import controls apply only to non-EECsources - or to increase throughput rapidly by a system of import controls.It takes about eighteen months to re-design a television chassis and thecircuitry to take a new tube.   Even if demand is stimulated by a relaxation of credit controls set-makers cannot switch their sources of supplyovernight.   This will be doubly difficult if, as the Secretary of State for industry indicates in his paper (C(75) 133), Thorns will not continue atSkelmersdale, since their technology based on RCA patents is completelydifferent from the Phillips technology of Mullard.2
6.   The television set makers are therefore   strongly opposed to import controls.   All depend to some extent or other on imported tubes.   A severecut in imports would eliminate substantial quantities of those types oftubes not at present made in the United Kingdom and cause seriousunemployment in the set industry.   Since controls on their key component(and the creation of a United Kingdom monopoly supplier) would make themless competitive against foreign television manufacturers, we could expectrestrictions on imported tubes to increase imports of finished sets(particularly if credit controls are relaxed) while exports of sets (nownearly as great as imports) would also be seriously harmed.   This damage to the balance of trade and levels of employment in the television setmaking industry is likely greatly to outweigh any possible benefits tothe television tube industry.7.   Finally, the imposition of quantitative restrictions would ensure theabandonment by the Japanese of their voluntary price increases.   Since,under any import control scheme, we should need to admit those types oftube not made here fairly freely, a major price differential would reappearbetween those tubes made here and overseas.   This would distort the market in favour of the smaller sizes of television sets in which the Britishindustry is weakest.8,   If the domestic benefits are dubious, the international repercussions of quantitative restrictions would be very damaging indeed.   Any controlswould need to be applied to imports from Japan, Canada and the UnitedStates of America.   The Japanese are unlikely to take a tolerant view of a sudden switch of policy on tubes so soon after they have at our requestentered into an arrangement on prices which they for their part havehonoured.   We are likely to lose all the existing voluntary export restraintarrangements with Japan on other sensitve products, to suffer retaliationand to receive an unco-operative response to our approaches to theJapanese about the level of television set exports in 1976.   The americans have also made it clear that they would expect compensation or, in itsabsence, to retaliate.   It would add fuel to United States protectionistpressures and affect adversely our chances of favourable decisions in thevarious important pending countervailing,, dumping and escape clause cases in the United States of America.   Given that imports have been falling andthere has been no increase in import penetration, the Commission are also likely to find it difficult to accept, let alone to justify in GATT, anArticle XIX case,
9.   I conclude that it would he quite contrary to British interests toabandon an arrangement on colour television tubes which stands some chanceof success (the understandings with the Japanese and the United Kingdomset industry) in favour of an immediate decision to impose import restrictionsbefore we know the terms on which the industry can be restructured orwhether any kind of import control scheme can be devised which will confernet benefit on the television industry as a whole (tubes and sets).10.   At the same time, even though the Japanese Government have asked usnot to reveal publicly their role in encouraging their industry to put uptube prices, I believe that we can and should do more to make it known thatthe Government has already acted on television tubes, not by controllingimports (which would not have solved the problem) but by promoting anincrease in the price and thus the return to British manufacturers.   Inparticular, I would propose to call in the leaders of the unions concerned(principally the General and Municipal Workers Union and the electrical engineering and Plumbing Trade Union and explain the position to them.P department of Trade25 November 19754
