The Development of National GiroIntroduction! 1. Tn his statement of 12th March 1975, the then Secretary of State for industry told the House of Commons that the Government had decided upon a number of measures designed to set Giro on a surer foundation.These included the provision of a more extended banking service and areconstruction of its capital, including the introduction of public dividendcapital, so as to better suit it to Giro&apos;s present and future needs and earning capacity. (Official Report, Cols. 522-523.)2. The National Giro service opened in October 1968. In November1970, the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications announced in thecourse of a debate on Post Office affairs that the Government of the day had instituted a review of Giro. This was carried out in consultation withthe Post Office Board and with the assistance of Cooper Brothers. Obviously,the fact that the review was taking place made the future of Giro uncertain;and indeed, the Minister recognised the need to reach a decision as soonas possible. A year later, in November 1971, the Government announcedits conclusion that Giro should continue and that new targets would beset for the service.I 3. The targets were announced in March 1972, when the Minister of posts and Telecommunications informed the House that the followingfinancial objectives had been set for Giro:(a) to make a positive contribution to Post Office finances within a year of introducing new tariffs. (These were introduced in July 1972);I    and(b) to cover its overheads, including depreciation and interest on bothassets and losses, within five years, ie by July 1977.In any discussion of the future of Giro it is worth noting that both of the objectives were achieved ahead of target.Achievement to date4. Despite the restraint on its growth due to the review and to its inability to provide wider banking services, Giro has established a role of consider-able value. Its annual transactions now number some 180 million andturnover has reached some  25 billion a year. There are some 460,000personal account holders. In other fields there has been a growth of businessnot foreseen when the service was launched which is both profitable toGiro and also provides considerable social advantages. The developmentof the business deposit service has resulted in the growth of business accountsto some 30,000 and in the value of cash deposits rising nearly six-fold inthe last three years to about  3,500 million a year by March 1975. Inaddition over 100 local authorities now use Giro&apos;s rent collection service.
This generates about 20 million transactions annually, to a total value ofabout  200 million.5. The financial results for Giro for the last four financial years are asfollows:Trading profit [loss] before charging interest payable	1971-72  m [5.6]	1972-73  m [3.3]	1973-74  m 0.2	1974-75  m 1.3Provision [charged] or released for unrealised losses on investments	-	[1-0]	[3.1]	2.6	[5.6]	[4.3]	[2.9]	3.9Compensation for price restraint	 	i -	1.4	Interest payable on loans				(a) to finance losses	[16]	[2.2]	[2.7]	[3.0](b) to finance net assets	[0.6]	[0.6]	[0.9]	[0.8][Deficit] or surplus for year	[7.8]	[7.1]	[5.1]	[0.1]The table shows:(a) a progressive improvement in the trading results before the deduc-tion of interest charges and provision for unrealised losses on invest-ments. The loss in the second year was less than that in the first; andin the third and fourth years the service more than recouped itsoperational costs;(b) that, despite the improvement in trading profit Giro has beenfaced with an increasing burden of interest charges mainly attributable to the need to finance the losses it has sustained.Nevertheless the first financial objective set by the Government of the day in1972 was achieved ahead of target by March 1973. The second was achievedalso ahead of target, in 1974-75, due in no small part to favourable move-ments in the stock market which permitted a release from the provision forunrealised losses on investments.Cancellation of debt6. By the end of the last financial year 1974-75 Giro&apos;s outstanding debthad amounted to  42.5 million, financing net assets of  9.1 million2, and anaccumulated deficit of  33.4 million. The amount of the debt is such thatthe interest payable on it will continue for some years to exceed the tradingprofits and so will add to the amount of debt to be serviced. While this1 and 2 These figures represent an adjustment to the actual figures of  50.2 million and  16.8 million as published in the Post Office Accounts for 1974-75. They excludefor the purposes of the capital reconstruction  7.7 million of borrowings made byGiro on behalf of the Remittance Services. This amount was included in debtors inthe Giro Balance Sheet at 31 March 1975. Giro and Remittance Services togetherconstitute a single business within the Post Office and the cancellation of debt (andthe legislation giving effect to it) relate only to Giro.
remains so there is no prospect of Giro&apos;s achieving lasting viability for along time to come. Accordingly the Government proposes that  16.7 millionie half of the past losses, should be written-off. A write-off of this amount would leave Giro with loans totalling some  25.8 million required to finance the remaining  16.7 million of losses and net assets of some  9.1 million,a total which in the Government^ view Giro should be able to service.7. The total amount to be written off in relation to losses during the nine-year period 1966-67 to 1974-75 will be  16.7 million. In order toallow for the incidence of differing interest rates over the period, the  16.7 million write-off will be distributed over borrowings made during the nine years in the same proportion as the borrowings used to finance the losses.Public dividend capital8. Public dividend capital (PDC) was first introduced in 1966 and currentlyforms part of the capital structure of the British Steel Corporation and theBritish Airways Board: it is appropriate for nationalised industries which arebasically profitable and are set financial objectives but are subject to fluctua-tions from year to year in their financial results. It is appropriate for Girobecause short-term changes in monetary conditions have a significant effecton its profitability.9. The Government concluded that an appropriate amount to convertinto PDC would be  13 million or half of Giro&apos;s indebtedness remaining afterthe write-off of half its losses: the resulting ratio of National Loans Fund(NLF) in debtedness to PDC is broadly in line with that for the two otherindustries referred to above. It therefore proposes to invest this sum fromthe Consolidated Fund and to authorise the consequential adjustment tothe loans to the Post Office from the NLF. Dividends will be paid intothe Consolidated Fund. As the PDC is being provided solely to finance theactivities of Giro, the amount of dividend payments will be determinedirrespective of the trading results of the Post Office as a whole. This reflects the fact that Giro&apos;s operations are financially independent of the rest of thePost Office, by which it is not cross-subsidised and for the use of whose services it pays properly assessed charges on a commercial basis.10. The total amount to be converted to PDC will be  13 million. Therewill be a consequential deduction of this amount from the advances as already written down in accordance with paragraph 6. Like the write-offthis deduction will also be distributed over the nine years, by reference tothe written down advances for each year.11. The overall reduction in Giro&apos;s liability to pay interest is expected tobe of the order of  20 million over the five years 1975-76 to 1979-80. against this, dividend payments on the  13 million PDC are expected to be not lessthan the interest which otherwise would have been paid on that sum over that period.

12. The following table illustrates the proposals:Balance Sheet at 31 March 1975 SMAdjustedActual^AfterActual*ReconstructionPDCLoans from NLFAccumulated DeficitNet Assets50.2[33.4]16.842.5[33.4]9.113.012.8[16.7]9.1*After deductingloans raised to financeRemittance ServicesfAs in Post Officepublished AccountsFinancial objective13. Given access to the new types of business described below and thecapital structure described above, Giro will be placed on a firm footing.It will be required to meet a new financial objective reflecting its new circumstances. This objective will be realistic and sufficiently demanding toensure fair competition with other institutions. In addition, the Secretary ofState will determine each year, after consultation with the Post Office, theamount of dividend to be paid by it in respect of Giro. In practice Girowill be expected to pay by way of dividend all its profits except those thatare agreed to be required for the development of the business.14. So that the performance and financial situation of Giro will show upclearly in isolation from other Post Office activities, the Government willrequire the Post Office to publish separate Giro Profit and Loss accounts and Balance Sheets. (This has already been done in respect of 1974-75.)15. The Government consider that Giro must be able to offer bothits personal and corporate customers a fuller range of banking services to complement its money transmission service. It has hitherto been handi-capped because it has not been able to offer a full enough range of normalbanking services. That inability has put Giro at a disadvantage in com-competing with the banks for the custom of people to whom the opening of a bank account would be the normal expectation, while prospective corporatecustomers have seen it as an obstacle to more extended use of Giro. To theextent that Giro can attract personal account holders who are weekly paid and might not otherwise open bank accounts, it will be promoting the sociallydesirable aim of spreading the banking habit more widely and thus ofGiro accountsWider banking services
reducing the costly and insecure use of cash for wages. Giro is able toprovide its services through 21,000 post offices, which the general publiccommonly use for other purposes, and is well placed to provide bankingservices to people who have not hitherto opened current bank accountsor used National Savings Bank services.16. The Government is therefore authorising, under existing legislation,the phased expansion of Giro&apos;s banking facilities to include the provisionof personal loans (introduced on 2 June 1975) and personal overdrafts;and overdrafts for local authorities, nationalised industries and businesscustomers, on terms that will offer fair competition to other lenders. It is also accepted in principle that Giro should be authorised to provide other bank-ing services such as credit cards, cheque guarantee cards and bridgingloans, subject to detailed discussions with the Government.17. Commercial prudence and the need to build up financial and admini-strative resources and expertise to handle the new business dictate that theexpansion of Giro&apos;s services should be gradual. Wherever this seems desirablethe Post Office will undertake a pilot service with a view to establishingwhether to proceed to a general and permanent service. The timing ofthe introduction and scope of the new facilities would be for the PostOffice to consider in consultation with the Government and the monetaryauthorities; and would be fully subject to the prudential and credit controlsapplied to banks generally.18. At present Giro is required to maintain a liquidity of 20 per cent.But as Giro develops its banking activities it is intended that it should become subject to the instruments of monetary policy, eg reserve assetratios on the same basis as other banks.Legislation19. The changes to be effected in the capital structure of Giro require legislation and the opportunity will be taken to remove any doubt over thepowers of the Post Office to introduce certain of the new facilities. a post Office (Banking Services) Bill is being introduced whereby, subjectto the approval of Parliament, the capital reconstruction will take effect from 1 April 1975.Conclusion20. The Government believes that the new arrangements will establishGiro with a sound financial basis on which to develop its full potential tothe social and economic benefit of the community.Dd 139236 K 80/75Printed   in   England   for   Her   Majesty&apos;s   Stationery   Office   by   Williams   Lea,   London
