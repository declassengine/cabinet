DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government(75) 139 COPY NO     812 December 1975CABINETCHRYSLERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for industry. The Cabinet invited me (CC(75) 51st Conclusions, Minute 3) tocontinue negotiations in good faith but without commitment with the chrysler Corporation (CC) on the scheme for a possible reducedChrysler UK operation (Scheme B in Annex to C(75) 128) and to put in handa number of studies.A REDUCED CHRYSLER UK OPERATION SCHEME B2. I was invited by Cabinet to obtain from consultants appointed bythe Department of Industry an independent assessment of the prospectiveprofitability of Scheme B.    With the agreement of Scottish Ministers,Coopers and Lybrand were appointed to carry out this assessment.Coopers and LybrandJs conclusions are summarised in Annex A(i).    they state that the forecasts are based on assumptions made by CC whichindividually are reasonable;  but they regard it as unlikely that all these assumptions will be fulfilled together and note that there is no generalcontingency provision against major mishaps.    They note also that thecompany would be unable to guarantee funds for model development for the19801s.    Coopers and Lybrand therefore conclude that Scheme B is notviable,3. Subject to these important reservations, they confirm that thefinancial requirement of CCs Scheme B to 1979 is not less than 96 million; if CC provide  35 million the reduced interest requirementwould bring this down to  80 million.    Thus Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould have to find  45 million of capital;  in addition Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would have to assume responsibility for CCs guarantees of Chrysler UK borrowing etc. (currently  68 million).    Her Majesty&apos;governments liability under Scheme B would therefore total  113 million.4.        In tough discussion with Mr Riccardo, officials have argued thatthe offer of  35 million is a cheap get-out for CC and a quite inadequateprice for the assumption by Her Majesty&apos;s Government of responsibility forall the difficult decisions (including the immediate 10, 000 redundancies).1
involved in Scheme B and for all future financing,    Mr Riccardo wasadamant that his offer of  35 million was his last word;  he describedit as a fair and generous offer for which he would be criticised by hisshareholders, but declined to provide any justification of the figure,5. He also reverted to his other offer of  13 million, with CC retaininga minority stake, and suggested Her Majesty&apos;s Government should notdismiss this.    But it would not mean any real stake in the future of Chrysler UK:  if Chrysler UK did ever generate profits, CC would share in them; but they would have no share in losses.    Under this option theinterest saving would be smaller, and the total cash requirement 90 million;  Her Majesty&apos;s Government would have to find  77 million of this, and assume the guarantees,    I see no attraction in this option.6.        A note is attached at Annex A(ii) on the details of the basis onwhich CC would participate in Scheme B (without any financial commitmentbeyond their once-for-all initial payment).    Whilst it shows how far CCwould be prepared to commit themselves to support Scheme B in relationto management, distribution etc, it is clear that they could not be held tocontinued participation if it was not in their commercial interest to do so,so that in the last resort they would have the power to make or break theoperation without any responsibility for the consequences,POSSIBLE INVOLVEMENT OF BRITISH. LEY LAND AND IMPACT on united KINGDOM CAR MAKERS7. The Cabinet also invited me to consult with the National EnterpriseBoard (not) and British Leyland (BL) about ways in which they mightassist.    Notes by the not and BL are at Annexes B(i) and (ii); none ofthe Chrysler UK production facilities at Linwood or elsewhere are of any use to BL and any involvement by BL in the Chrysler UK situation would seriously endanger its success;  I consider that should not be pursued.not consider that Scheme B would be damaging for BL,    Both Ford andGeneral Motors, employing 90, 000 in this country, have told me that aChrysler rescue could put their United Kingdom plans in jeopardy.    Bothhave plants in sensitive areas, including Halewood and Ellesmere Porton Merseyside, which might be put at risk.    If we let Chrysler UK go,we should seek to persuade the Iranians to let BL take over the Iraniancontract,VIEWS OF TRADE UNIONS8, Cabinet further invited the Secretary of State for Employment and myself to consult with senior trade union leaders on their view about the acceptability of the options open to us, including specifically Scheme B,We therefore discussed these options in strict confidence withMr Lionel Murray, Mr Jack Jones, Mr Bob Wright and Mr Grenville Hawley.They were unanimous in their agreement that in these distastefulcircumstances it would be best to accept the complete withdrawal of2
Chrysler from the United Kingdom, and that Scheme B besides beingunviable would be totally unacceptable to all Chrysler employeesincluding those at Linwood.    They added that it would also be unworkable,since the Ryton workers would stop movement of plant to Linwood.    they suggested that we should pay all the Chrysler workers a 40 hour wage for six months to provide an opportunity for them to propose possible alternative schemes of employment.    They offered their co-operation,if the Government accepted such a scheme, in explaining the situation tothe work force.    They were emphatic that when the government announced the withdrawal of Chrysler, it must simultaneously announce the imposition of effective import controls.CONSEQUENCES OF CHRYSLER UK BEING LIQUIDATED9. i. For Her Majesty&apos;s GovernmentThe Secretary of State for Employment is putting in a separate paper onredundancies and on the trade unions&apos; proposal to augment temporarilythe pay of Chrysler workers.ii.        For CCThe note at Annex C(i) shows that whilst in the long run CC might come out all square, they would face considerable short term expense and difficulties, and could have no certainty about the final outcome.    To get out for a once-for-all payment of  35 million, which would be at theexpense of the United States Government, looks a cheap and attractiveoption.    CCs tax position is dealt with in Annex C(ii).CONCLUSIONS10.        Liquidation of Chrysler UK will have grim consequences.    But forHer Majesty&apos;s Government to accept responsibility, residual or otherwise,for Chrysler UK after CC have abandoned all financial commitment to it,as they are inflexibly determined to do, would make nonsense of our policy for the industry; would damage the prospects for British Leyland,and also of Ford UK and Vauxhall, and put at further risk employment attheir plants in sensitive areas;  would land us with an open-ended financial commitment and the likelihood that later on we should have direct responsibility for further closures in one or more of these companies,with all the odium this would entail, odium which in present circumstances would rest fairly and squarely with Chrysler.    In practice Chrysler UKis already liquidating itself and I cannot expect CC to hold their handsfor more than a very few days more.   Accordingly I invite my colleagues to agree:a.        We should not accept responsibility for any part of Chrysler UK operation but should make clear that full responsibilityfor liquidating it lies with CC.. 3 ) . m . &apos; .&apos; &apos; &quot;    I -&apos; : &apos;&amp;
bo I should inform Farliament of our decision immediately.c. In announcing the decision I should   say that the Secretaryof State for Employment will be introducing his special redundancyscheme, and that the Secretary of State for Trade will immediately be introducing import controls on motor vehicles.    If the Secretaryof State for Trade is not able in the time available to completeconsultations with the Commission I should say that he has putproposals to the Commission and he aims to clear them as amatter of urgency.d. We should explore with the Iranians whether BL might take over their contract.e. That the Central Policy Review Staff report on the motor industry should be published at the same time as I make thestatement on Chrysler.E G V Department of industry December 19754
vmary of coopers AND lybr/LNJ^ISS-jtCLUBIONSANNEX A(i)0pers and Lybrand have reviewed the forecasts for the years 1976 to;/and, while they consider that the individual detailed assumptionsj which the forecasts are based are reasonable ones, no provisionsjve been made for overall contingencies in an industry where suchatingencies are even more necessary.   There are also a number of;:er reservations that they make, as follows:-(a) no allowance has been made for the effect of any majorstrike ;(b) the major part of Chrysler&apos;s output is expected to be sold to Iran and any significant reduction in such saleswould have a serious effect on profitability;    the Irancontract is subject to rather more elements of uncertainty than would apply to a similar contract inthe UK;(c) the forecast profitability of the business is highlysensitive to comparatively small variations in the levelof sales or the profit margins achieved.   Thus a variation in turnover of 5% or in profit margins of 1% would affect the profitability by something ofthe order of  3 million;(d) the depreciation to be charged for the four years is based on historical costs, reduced because a significant part of the fixed assets have been whollywritten off.   The estimated replacement values for suchfixed assets are a great deal higher and, if depreciationwas to be charged on a replacement basis, the expectedprofitability for 1977 to 1979 would be turned into losses;(e) looking ahead to the period after 1979 there seems tobe great uncertainty as to where the funds for capitalexpenditure on new mo^^^gf new fflaJor components such
SECRETas engines would come from.   On the basis of thefigures put forward, such funds would not be generatedfrom its trading activities.Their conclusion is that no provision has been made for any majoradverse effects that might result from any of the above factors.Thus the figures shown by the forecasts are necessarily subjectto the effect of these uncertainties.On the basis of the forecast   figures Coopers and Lybrand agree that,assuming an equity injection of  55M for capital expenditure,but funding the rest of the cash outflow during the four yearsby way of loans, the funds required from HMG would be in total 96mfor funding capital expenditure and losses during the period.These figures are necessarily subject to the uncertainties mentionedabove in relation to the forecasts.1 December 1975
5Ec;:.r:ANNEX ACii)CHRYSLER (UK) LIMITED;    FUTURE PARTICIPATION BY CHRYSLERCORPORATION1       In the event of the continuation of the activities of Chrysler (UK) Limited, in some modified form through a company controlled or wholly owned by the British Government,the Chrysler Corporation, which term refers to the chrysler corporation or one or more of its wholly owned subsidiariesor any combination of them, is willing to participate in the uk company by making available the knowledge, expertice,personnel and facilities of the Chrysler Corporation world-wide, subject to the negotiation of a satisfactory commercialcontract covering the provision of these services and facilities.No detailed consideration has been given to the form of sucha contract but the Chrysler Corporation would accept a simplecost contract of management compensation and expenses.Chrysler Corporation would also   consider contractsincluding incentives based in some way on levels of sales,exports and profits.    In particular under such a contractthe Chrysler Corporation is willing to participate in the management, the future model development policy andthe distribution of the products of the UK company, and in securing for the UK company the continuation of the contract forthe supply of completely knocked down (CKD) kits to the IranNational Industrial Manufacturing Company, (JNIM) as broadlydescribed below.2      Management(i)   An arrangement, under which the Board of Directors elected by shareholders of the UK company included   chrysler corporation nominees, would be acceptable to chrysler corporation.
i) The UK company and its directors would &quot;be responsible to the shareholders but the Chrysler Corportion wouldprovide the UK company with the necessary managementpersonnel and all information relevant to the management and operation of all aspects of the UK company&apos;activities as if it were a wholly owned subsidiary ofthe Chrysler Corporation, whether or not all themanagement personnel are drawn from the chrysler corporation.ii)When management personnel, for example the managing director, directors or senior executives with responsibilities in particular fields are drawn fromthe Chrysler Corporation to serve in the UK company,they would nevertheless continue to be employees ofthe Chrysler Corporation.    In making such appointmentsthe Chrysler Corporation would recognise the significance of the UK operation in relation   to Chrysler Corporation^subsidiary companies.v) Career   structures in the Chrysler Corporation would include appointments to the UK company and the careerprospects of those appointed would be commensurate withthe significance of the UK company and would not bein any way prejudiced or reduced simply by virtue ofthe appointment.Future Model Policy)   The Chrysler Corporation would provide all necessarytechnical and other data and make available theresources of the Chrysler Corporation to assist itin the successful completion of the UK company&apos;snew model programmes.
(ii)   The Chrysler Corporation would wish to see the UKcompany&apos;s model development programme directed towardsproducing vehicles which would be complementary   tothe ranges produced by the Chrysler Corporation.This would in the Corporation^ view lead&apos; to a more effective use of financial resources and marketingand distribution facilities.(iii)   The Chrysler Corporation would nevertheless be preparedto provide the necessary techical assistance and facilities for the development of models which werenot complementary but it would not be committed tomarketing such models through its international dis-tribution network,(iv)    In advising the UK company on model development the chrysler Corporation would keep the UK company informed of Chrysler Corporation^ own future programme.   the location of the production of a new model in the chrysler corporation^ programme would be determined by the normalindustrial and commercial considerations, involved.Chrysler Corporation would not exclude the UK company from these developments and would regard the capacity and facilities as complementary to those of chrysler corporation and its subsidiaries.(v) The Cost of development and any other work necessaryfor all new or improved models to be produced in the uk would be borne by the UK company.4 Distribution Arrangements(i)     The world-wide marketing and. distribution network ofthe Chrysler Corporation would be available to the UKCompany.
(ii) The Chrysler Corporation would, however, not takespecified numbers of UK produced vehicles and partsfor overseas markets.    Sales would have to be determinedby the competitiveness of the products.    ChryslerCorporations margin on all sales made through itsnetworks outside the UK would be comparable to those under its normal commercial arrangements.(iii) The UK company would retain such dealerships in the uk as were needed for the modified operation.   Anyliabilities to dealers who were not retained or optedto terminate their dealerships would rest with the UKcompanyQ(iv) The supply of vehicles and parts produced by the chrysler Corporation or any of its subsidiaries forsales in the UK would be conducted wholly through the uk company.(v) There would be no commission to Chrysler Corporation onany sales of the Corporation^ or its subsidiaries&apos;vehicles and parts after their purchase by the .TJKcompany.&apos;3 Iranian Contract(i) The Chrysler Corporation would assist in every wayit: could to secure a     written agreement that the contract to supply CKD kits would be continued withthe UK company.(ii) The Chrysler Corporation would continue to provide a written assurance to INIM that all the resources ofthe Corporation would be available to the UK companyunder this contract, just as if the UK company had been a wholly owned subsidiary of the Chrysler Corporation.SECRET
secret annex B (i)ATTITUDE OF BRITISH LEYLAND TO A TAKEOVER of Chrysler (UK) LIMITED OR CERTAIN OF ITS assets and ACTIVITIES.general,    The arguments against a British Leyland takeover of Chrysler (UK)Limited as it stands are overwhelming.  British Leyland alreadyhas more workers and staff than it needs (except for certain design and engineering personnel with special skills), more capacity thanit needs (except for certain specialised facilities), too manymanufacturing locations, and more dealers than are needed (although in some geographical areas the network could usefully be strengthened).2. BL would, therefore, derive no advantage whatsoever from the take-over of Chrysler. Indeed it would gravely jeopardize the recovery ofBL for the following reasons:(a)       The capacity required for the combined company would not bemuch greater than that planned for BL alone for the rest ofthis decade.(b)The over-capacity would lead to an even longer period ofunprofitability because of the very heavy burden of fixed costs.The increased over-manning and multiplicity of wage structureswould significantly compound the already formidable industrial relations task facing unions and management, including the pressure for parity with Ryton rates of pay.(d)The subsidising of Chrysler would reinforce the fallacy that jobsecurity is not dependent on competitive economic realities.BL&apos;s biggest single task is persuading the workforce that slack-
Pap.o 2-ness and lack of self-discipline would not in future be bailedout.(e) The added burden of yet more product and plant modernisation and rationalisation may well be beyond the capacity of the alreadystretched technical and management teams.(f) The fact that the majority of exports of Chrysler UK productsare marketed by organisations outside the control of ChryslerUK would mean that these sales might be lost to the combinedcompany, and further under-utilisation of the UK factorieswould result.These are problems which could not be solved even by providing additional financial support on a massive scale, over and above that already envisaged for BL alone, or by any foreseeable extension of thetime scale for BL&apos;s recovery.Limited Interest in Certain Assets and ActivitiesBL has carefully considered what elements it might wish to salvagefrom Chrysler&apos;s assets and activities.  It should be stressed that any interest in manufacturing or other specific facilities would arise only after they had been relinquished by Chrysler and the problems of labourre-deployment had been resolved. It should also be stressed that BLdoes not need additional manufacturing facilities but rather to rationaliseand modernise existing facilities and adapt them to the production of newmodels. That will, as the Ryder Report showed, cost a great deal ofmoney, but the acquisition of the Chrysler facilities would not in generalhelp with the problem or reduce the cost.Two questions have been examined specifically:(i)       Whether the Linwood facilities might be used to augment mediumcommercial vehicle prodigfeSfbEft Bathgate;
Page 3(ii)      Whether any of the Chrysler facilities could be used to expandLand Rover production.On (i) there is already uneconomic working at Bathgate because the lay-out was planned to provide eventually for a 50% increase abovecurrent capacity. The establishment of an additional production unitat Linwood (30 to 40 miles away) would postpone for many years thetime when Bathgate could be operated economically.On (ii) Land Rover capacity has already been substantially increasedover the past two years from 850 to 1,350 per week (39,000 to 62,000 per year).  When the Rover replacement, the SD1, is introduced into thenew assembly complex at Solihull early in 1976, production of theexisting product at Solihull North Works will cease and this will releaseadequate assembly space for all foreseeable demands for Land Rovers(i. e. to over 80,000 units in the late 1970&apos;s).  The bottleneck is, however,the supply of engine components.  To bring this up to the level, commen-commensurate with demand and with eventual assembly capacity would require a major expansion and the cost would probably be in the region of  75m.The prudent course is, therefore, to modernise the Land Rover by major re-design rather than expand the capacity of the old design.  Tocover the situation in the interim, plans are being developed within BLto increase Land Rover availability by the possible introduction ofdifferent engines. This problem would be in no way eased by theacquisition of any of the Chrysler facilities. It would take 18 months to2 years to adapt them to produce engine components for Land Roversand this would in no way help with the short-term problem.The only elements in Chrysler&apos;s assets or activities which BL wouldbe interested in acquiring are:(i) The arrangement with Iran National(ii) The vehicle test facilities at Bruntingthorpe and the EngineeringCentre at Whitley
(iii)     200 - 300 Chrysler dealers in particular geographical areas.Brief notes are provided below on each of these items.The Arrangement with Iran National-9.       BL would be interested in taking up the existing Chrysler responsibilities in Iran for the supply of power units (engines and gearboxes) and also thesupply of rear axle units, by substituting BL &quot;Marina&quot; power units -approximate engineering lead time would be 9-12 months.  It is consideredthat the Engineering&apos; of these units into a Chrysler designed body shell, as contemplated by Iran National, will not present any major difficulty andthat supplies could be made available to match both timing and quantitydemands.  BL is also aware that Iran National is interested in broadeningits product range to include luxury cars and commercial light vans. Anarrangement originally confined to &quot;Marina&quot; power units could subsequently be developed into a much wider arrangement which could have major   1potential benefits for BL.Bruntingthorpe and Whitley10.       BL is interested in acquiring the &apos;Bruntingthorpe&apos; vehicle test area fromChrysler and is currently engaged in negotiation with Chrysler manage-ment on this matter.  Similarly, BL would be interested in the possibility Iof acquiring the Whitley&apos; Engineering Centre facilities and probably could Isubsequently re-engage some of the qualified engineers working in the design and Development areas of Chrysler UK.iDealers11.        Of the 800 dealer outlets that Chrysler have in the UK they will wish toretain a number suitable to support their Simca range.  24 distributorsare wholly owned by Chrysler UK.  The uncertainty of the Chrysler future jand their recent reduced penetration has already started most franchise-   SECRET
holders looking for alternative sources of supply.   The courses open areto try for Leyland, Ford, Vauxhall or overseas manufacturers.  The lastis the most likely quick answer and emphasises the need for some import control in the short-term.As a defensive move BL would wish to take on certain of the Chryslerdealers.  BL is, however, just completing a substantial rationalisation of its dealer network which has reduced the number of outlets from6, 500 to 3, 200 in the last year.  BL would, therefore, be interested in giving franchises to not more than 200 - 300 of the Chrysler dealers and only in particular geographical areas where BL is at present sparselyrepresented or where the facilities and management of the Chryslerdealers are superior to those of the current BL dealers.
Page 6SUMMARYA. A takeover of Chrysler UK as it stands would bring no advantage to BL and could seriously jeopardize its recovery.B. BL would have a limited interest in certain of Chrysler\sassets and activities but only after Chrysler had relinquishedthem and the problems of labour re-deployment had been resolved.C. These assets and activities are confined to:(i) the arrangement with Iran National(ii) the acquisition of the Bruntingthorpe test facilities and the Whitley Engineering Centre(iii) 200 - 300 Chrysler dealers in particular geographical areas.
SECRETAJMEX   (ii)chrysler &quot;SCHEME B&quot;This paper is concerned with assessing:i   whether the Chrysler Scheme B is in broad economic andindustrial terms a viable proposition;ii   what the effect would be on British Leyland if Scheme Bwent ahead.product Plan2     From early 1977 onwards Scheme B envisages that Chryslerwill be producing only two cars in the UK, both at Linwood:New &quot;Chevette&quot; typeFace-lifted Avenger, replaced by C4 in 1979/80.It is also assumed that with this model range the share of the uk market would be 5 per cent.3      In October 1975 the Chrysler share of the UK market derivedfrom the three models Imp, Avenger and Hunter was 6.2 per cent.To get a market share of around 5 per cent from the two models(the Chevette type and the face-lifted Avenger and Avengerreplacement)   it has to be assumed:i   that the Avenger, with the help of its face-lift, not onlyretains its present 3.3 per cent share of the UK marketbut also captures about half (ie 1 per cent) of the Hunter&apos;present 2.2 per cent share, making 4.3 per cent;ii   that the new Chevette type is at least two-thirds assuccessful as the Vauxhall Chevette and has a market shareof say 2 per cent;iii that the new Chevette type reduces the Avenger&apos;s marketshare by only 1 per cent, making the Avenger net marketshare 3.3 per cent.4      In considering whether Chrysler could perform as well as this, it should be borne in mind that during 1976 the modelrange will be unusually weak.    Imp production will have ceased,Hunter production ceases in the middle of 1976 and Avengerproduction will be subject to the dislocation of the move fromRyton to Linwood.    It will be extremely difficult for Chryslerto hold together its dealer network and to retain customerconfidence during this period to the extent necessary to achieve a market share of 5 per cent for 1977 onwards.
Sales5       If,  on these highly optimistic assumptions, Chrysler wereto achieve a UK market share of 5 per cent or thereabouts and export sales of about 25,000, total sales of these two models,based on British Leyland&apos;s forecasts of UK car registrationswould be as follows:	Total UK Registrations	UK Sales	Export Sales	Total Sales1977	1,370,000	69,000	25,000	94,0001978	1,429,000	71,000	25,000	96,0001979	1,491,000	75,000	25,000	100,0001980	1, 500,000	75,000	25,000	100,000Capacity6       Capacity at Linwood on double shift working is assumed tobe 140,000 units.    On the assumption about sales in paragraph 4,capacity utilisation at Linwood would be as follows:1977 67%1978 69%1979 71%1980 71%Even at the end of the period Linwood would not be operating atthe 85% capacity which is normally regarded as necessary for aplant to break even.    Even in 1979 and 1980 the plant would notbe operating significantly above one-shift capacity.7       Even if Linwood were able to operate at a more economicutilisation of capacity, the total capacity of 140,000 units is considerably smaller than the size suggested in the CPRS report and accepted by most motor industry experts as the minimumcompetitive size for an assembly operation (250,000 units).For comparison, the annual capacity of BL&apos;s assembly operations at Cowley is some 320,000 units and at Longbridge some270,000 units.Viability of Scheme B8       There must therefore be very serious doubts about the viability of Scheme B on the following grounds:i    the assumptions underlying the forecast market share of5 per cent are seen as highly optimistic;ii    even if these assumptions are accepted,  the utilisation of capacity at Linwood is unprofitably low in a plant whichis in any case well below the minimum economic size for an assembly operation.- 2 -
Effect on BL9       If despite these very serious objections, Scheme B were togo ahead, the main effect on BL  (excluding wider considerationssuch as industrial relations) would be that it would lose theopportunity to take up some of the 5 per cent UK market shareChrysler hope to retain.    If BL were to capture 30 per cent ofthis 5 per ce^t share, ie 1.5 per cent, it would secureadditional UK sales of some 22,500 units a year on an averagetotal UK car market of some 1.5M a year.    This additional production could readily be absorbed in BL&apos;s capacity and,at anaverage economic profit of say  400 per unit, would yieldadditional profits of around  10M a year.    These additionalprofits would be lost to BL if Scheme B were to go ahead.SECKET
CONSEQUENCE OF THE LIQUIDATION OF CHRYSLER (UK)(Note by Officials)ANNEX C (Consequences for the Chrysler Corporation1The Chrysler Corporation (CC) have an investment of  80m inChrysler UK,  60m equity and  20m loans.   Under United Statestax law (see Annex C(ii))it would appear that 56 per cent of thiswould be recoverable by offset against their US tax liabilitiesif they abandon the investment before 31 December 1975.2CC have undertaken to meet all their liabilities in the UK,estimated at  134m excluding the debt of CUK to CC.     Inaddition if closure takes place severance payments could total 25m and operating rundown losses could amount to  15m.   Tothis total of  174m there should be added the cost of severingconnections with the 800-strong dealer body, including a possibleliability to re-purchase stocks of spares.   This liability isnot quantifiable.3 Against this figure, the company will attempt to realise itsassets totalling  146m at book value.     The range of possiblerealisable values is between  71m and  118m, indicating a lossof between  56m and  103m.4 We are advised that if the operation is structured effectivelyCUK could obtain 56 per cent tax relief on these losses.   Thiswould reduce their losses after tax to between  25m and  45m.The UK tax recovery of  44.8m (para l) would thus offset theloss perhaps with some margin, though the liability to dealersremains an unknown.5        Although in the end CC could get out about level, there would bean immediate call for some finance.    CC have advised us thatecruft*J tm       S\ ft. B
CUK will be put into voluntary liquidation and this will defersettlement of most of the liabilities for some time, and the banks, who are guaranteed by GC, might not press immediately.Probably some  50m would have to be found in the short runto repay the debenture, loans by HMG, redundancy payments andterminal losses.6 This out-turn which would require  50m to be found immediatelybut has prospects of final break-even compares with  35mthat will be paid to HMG if the ongoing solution is adopted.2 Balance of Payments Consequences1 Chrysler*s total exports for 1975 are forecast to be some 165m on the basis of data supplied by Chrysler to officials.Of this,  92m is attributable to the Iranian contract.   Some35 per cent of this  92m, say  32m, relates to componentsbought in the UK, which Chrysler have said would continue tobe sourcedin the United Kingdom, at least for some time, ifthe Iranian contract were to be sourced by CC outside the UK.2 The loss of export earnings in the event of Chrysler*withdrawal could therefore range from  165m at worst (ie werethe Iranian contract to be lost both to the Chrysler Cor-poration and to the UK and if no other UK manufacturer gainedany part of Chrysler&apos;s lost overseas sales) to  133m ifChrysler Corporation retained the Iranian contract, or to 73m if BL obtained it.   Both the latter figures could bereduced to the extent that BL, Ford and Vauxhall capturedpart of Chrysler&apos;s export market.
- 3 -UK sales by Chrysler for 1975 were forecast at  91m.   Againit is likely that UK producers rather than overseas producerswould capture much of this market;   if only 40 per cent went to foreign makers the loss would be confined to  36m.Chrysler buy very few materials and components abroad.   Theybuy British steel and glass exclusively, and orifcr some 2 percent of the value of the finished car is represented byimported components.     No adjustment to the foregoing figureshas therefore been necessary to allow for import content.The range of possible loss to the balance of payments inthe shorter term consequent on Chryslers disappearancecould therefore be between  256m and  100 m   dependingprimarily on the outcome of the Iranian contract and to a lesser extent to the success of other British manufacturersin taking Chryslers market share.Most of the resources made idle by Chrysler1s withdrawal would ultimately be re-deployed into other activities whichcould bring balance of payments benefits.   It is impossibleto forecast how quickly or completely this would occur.Any assessment of the loss from Chrysler&apos;s total withdrawalneeds to be read against the implications of alternativestrategies.Chrysler have forecast that on the basis of continuing but reduced volume car production their exportsafter a fall in 1976 attributable to non-recurring problems in Iran would return to about the 1975 levels for the remainder of the decade, with rather greater emphasis on commercial vehicles.
- 4 -3i Financial Consequences for Component Manufacturers1 A typical Chrysler car contains components from over 450suppliers, representing some 70 per cent of the final valueof the car.   The effect of the loss of Chrysler&apos;s contractson component makers would he widespread.   Suppliers are mainly concentrated in the West Midlands.2 The extent of damage to individual component makers depends on the proportion that their commitment to Chrysler hears totheir total sales, and the speed with which the Chryslercontracts can he replaced by others.     This in turn depends on whether the components are &quot;dedicated&quot; (ie will fitChrysler vehicles only) or can be offered to other manufacturers.3 Complete data on which to make any assessment of this situationis not available.   However the list annexed shows some of the major component suppliers to Chrysler and the significance of Chrysler1s contract to them.   However, these are substantialcompanies who probably have resources to tide them over any period of re-adjustment.   It is among the smaller suppliersthat casualties are the most likely to occur.4 Consequences for the Deader OrganisationChrysler UK has a dealer body of some 800, apart from 25 subsidiary companies engaged in vehicle distribution.    In the event of Chrysler*withdrawal, many would seek alternative distributorships, since the Simcadistributorships which many of them hold together with their Chrysler UKfranchises would rot provide a sufficient volume of sales in isolation.British Leyland are believed to be interested in granting franchises toup to 300 of these distributors.     There is no evidence of similar
Department of industry December 1975interest by Ford or Vauxhall.The other principal contenders for distributorships relinquished byChrysler would be the Japanese and the East Europeans.   Import restrictionson foreign cars would make it more difficult to grant these franchises,since the cars to be sold through these new outlets could be found onlyoy reducing allocations to existing dealers.The courses open to ex-Chrysler dealers are consequently as follows :-1 To give up dealing in new cars, either going out ofbusiness altogether or confining the business toservicing and second-hand car dealing.2 To take up a British Leyland franchise.3 To retain an existing Simca franchise, perhaps with   1an extended territory if a neighbouring Simca dealerhas given up.4 To take up a foreign franchise, if a supply of cars canbe obtained.The proportion of dealers who would adopt each course cannot be forecast.Some changes in dealership arrangements are also likely if Chrysler remains in production with car production confined to the Avenger.   The Hunter andthe Imp which would be discontinued represent about 45 Per oent of Chrysler&apos;current sales, and sales of the Avenger alone might rot be sufficient toretain the interest of some dealers.

ANNEX C (ii)Note by Coopers and Lybrand on the US Tax Implications of Action by ChryslerAMERICAN TAX POSITIONOfficials have consulted Coopers and Lybrand on the American tax position.The position is complex but thought to be as follows :If Chrysler Corporation (&quot;CC&quot;) abandon their investment in ChryslerUK (&quot;CUK&quot;) the capital loss sustained of  80M may be set against revenueprofits earned in the USA as long as the following conditions are met :(i) CC can establish that the investment has been completely abandoned and is completely valueless(ii) CC have no overseas income against which theloss may be set (CC have confirmed that this is so).In the event of a liquidation tax will be recoveredat approximately 56 percent on the  80M and, in the event of HMG participation, also on the  35Mterminal payment which CC have undertaken to pay HMG if HMG acquire CUK( 64M in total) although any ongoing operation could endanger the tax relief.     It is probable that if CC liquidate CUK the ultimate deficit(estimated at between  50M- 100M) will also rank for tax relief at 56 percent if the deficit is appropriately funded.Legislation is before Congress, but not yet enacted, which makes it advisable for CC to realise this loss before 31 December 1975*It has been put to CC that the  35M terminal payment is less than the tax relief CC will recover on the  80M already lost  &quot;$JAklJ.   This has beendenied by Mr Riccardo and it is impossible to clarify the matter furtherwithout access to CCs detailed tax position.
