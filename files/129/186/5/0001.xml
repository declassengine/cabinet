OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 13024 November 1975CABINETCHRYSLER:  REDUNDANCY ARRANGEMENTSNote by the Secretory of State for EmploymentCOPY NO31I attach a memorandum on redundancy arrangements which I have previously circulated to the Ministerial Group.M department of Employment24 November 1975
(secret)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment the Group invited me at its meeting on 12 November to prepare a further report developing the proposals in my memorandum of11 November (MISC 59(75)17)  and taking account of the points madein the Group&apos;s discussion.IThe case for a redundancy scheme -2.      In my earlier memorandum I  suggested that we should be preparedto put  30 million into a redundancy scheme.    This figure was rayestimate of what was needed to reconcile workers,  unions andopinion generally to a redundancy affecting 26,000 workers and a refusal by the Government to provide finance to keep the whole or apart of the company in business.3.     Where we would be most vulnerable to criticism is in allowing the Linwood plant to  close.    That is essentially the case for aredundancy scheme.    Redundancies are not welcome in Coventry at thepresent time but we may expect  jobs to be reasonably plentifulwhen the upturn comes.    This is  even more true of Dunstable andLuton.    It is not, however,  true of West Central Scotland.    If wewere to come to some arrangement with the company to keep Linwoodopen with the help of public money,  then I believe the Government&apos;sobligation to Chrysler1s workers would be largely discharged.    I doubt in that case that we need offer a publicly financed redundancyscheme for workers in Coventry and other centres outside Scotland.^.      On the other hand,  if the whole business is closed down,  I  donot think it is practical politics to offer a redundancy scheme forLinwood only.    We must then make it available to all Chrysler&apos;semployees.Possible types of benefit under a scheme and costs5.      I suggested in my earlier memorandum that,  to the extent possible,payments should be made in supplementation of unemployment pay accordingto the length of unemployment suffered and in supplementation of earnings in new jobs where such earnings fall below the level of^previous earnings with Chrysler.    Workers with less than one year&apos;sI service with the company might be excluded.    Thus, unemployment pay(secret)
(secret)might be brought up to the level of 75% of previous earnings durino-the period of unemployment.    A higher figure,  bearing in mind the lowertax lxabxlity and the need to retain an incentive to take up work couldonly be justified ?Tor the older workers, many of whom could beexpected to remain unemployed until they retired.    The cost of suchan arrangement,   depending on average length of unemployment  sufferedmight be up to  10 million.     (There is a fair possibility that themajority of the redundant workers,   even in Scotland, would find alter-native work within 6 months).6.      It is  the  common experience that redundant workers have toaccept alternative employment at a lower level of earnings than theyenjoyed before.    The cost of supplementing earnings would depend onthe period of supplementation decided upon and on whether the newearnings were brought up fully or only in part to the level of the oldearnings.    An average payment of  5 a week for 2 years to 20,000workers would cost around  10 million.7.      That leaves  10 million (if  30 million in all were to beprovided)  and this would enable a lump sum geared to length ofservice with Chrysler  (and perhaps also to age)  to be provided -including a small payment to those with less than one year&apos;s service.The average amount of such a lump sum would be  400.Options8.      It is  clear from these figures that schemes  costing  10 million or 20 million as well as  30 million would be feasible.    If economywere the over-riding criterion we could have a perfectly useful andhelpful scheme for  l0- 20 million.    However,  I have taken the view,as I think I have made clear,  that we are not looking for the cheapestscheme it is possible to devise,  but for a sum of money which willprovide adequate compensation and be seen to provide adequate compen-sation by those concerned in a situation which we shall be held partly responsible for having created by our refusal to  subsidise Chrysler.Looked at from that point of view it is my judgment that we need ascheme providing benefits up to a total cost of  30 million,  whichis rather more than  1,000 per head of all the redundant workers.9.      If we are  going to spend  30 million on a scheme it willprobably be necessary to spend some of it on lump sums.    Much of the attraction of schemes for making up unemployment pay and earningsarises from the fact that they can be made  quite inexpensive.    Anotherargument in their favour is that they are better geared to the post-redundancy situation.    However,  they have their drawbacks.     It is verydifficult to estimate their cost in advance and this is awkward in the chrysler circumstances.    They invite criticisms from other workers who do not get their unemployment benefit or their earnings made up.(This is also true of enhanced lump sums).    They are administrativelycomplex and would require a number of civil servants to run them forseveral years.2(secret)
(secret)10.    On the other hand,  a scheme confined to lump sums could easily be administered by Chrysler which has to make the statutory lump  sumpayments to its employees as part of the closing-down process.    Suchan arrangement might conce. rably be financed under the AppropriationAct without the need to  seek new legal powers.    New powers would be needed for a scheme to make up unemployment pay and earnings.    It isdesirable to avoid having the details of a scheme debated inParliament because most of the pressures are bound to be in thedirection of making improvements and,  therefore,   additions to thecost of whatever we propose.11.    The details of a scheme need to be negotiated with the unions.V7e cannot, therefore,  take final decisions about the content of ascheme at this stage.    I think we should go into the negotiations withall our options open and not put ourselves into any strait jackets atthis stage.Points raised in the last MISC 59 discussion12.    A number of points were raised in our last discussion:(i) It was suggested that devising a redundancy scheme for the motor industry would be difficult because the workforce was lessstable.    It is true that an industry with a high degree of labourturnover has less need of a redundancy scheme.    If there is  ascheme it  can and ought to be tailored so as to  exclude frombenefit,  or at any rate to give very small benefits to,  workers who have been with the company a short time only.(ii) The point was made that a special scheme for the motor industry would be a precedent for other industries  such asaerospace and shipbuilding.    I think it is a precedent that should be welcomed.    If we can run down the  shipbuilding industryto an economic size at the expense of a redundancy scheme thatwould be a price well worth paying.    I think we have got to face the need for Government to finance additional redundancy payments in certain limited circumstances.    That would be when there is declining industry where the employer is unable to pay and whenthe number of redundancies involved is exceptionally large.Additional arguments are available when the redundancies are inassisted areas and when there is Government involvement in thefact of the redundancies.The greater difficulty arises if comparisons are drawn betweenwhat is done for Chrysler or shipbuilding and what is the generalrun of redundant workers.    I believe the distinction can bejustified,  using the kind of arguments I have just mentioned.    Inthe case of Chrysler there is the  question of the workers maderedundant in the components industry.    These are spread about indifferent places and in different firms and I do not consider theyhave the same case for special treatment as the large numbers of Chrysler workers who will be made redundant at Linwood and in coventry.    Another kind of comparison will be with workers maderedundant in Coventry from Alfred Herbert as a result of theGovernment-supported reorganisation.    However,  in that case,Government finance went into keeping the firm in business, whichis not the case we are envisaging at Chrysler.3
(secret)(iii)    It was  suggested that public opinion might be critical of favourable treatment for workers in the motor car industrywho had been particularly highly paid and whose industrial relations record was bad.    This is a valid point.    although I believe there is a sufficient case for a redundancy schemefor Chrysler workers,  a much better case could undoubtedly bemade out in a number of other industries,   eg shipbuilding.(iv)    A point was made that the money for a redundancy scheme would have to be considered further,  if money was put intoChrysler in order to preserve the  jobs at Linwood.    I have dealt with this point in paragraph 3 above.Legal position13.    I do not administer any legislation under which it would bepossible to finance a special redundancy scheme for Chrysler workers and I am not aware of any other legislation which would serve thepurpose - with the possible exception of the Industry Act,  underwhich expenditure can be incurred &quot;to encourage arrangements for ensuring that any contraction of an industry proceeds in an orderlyway.&quot;    I understand,  however,  that the Department of Industry aredoubtful if this can be used to finance a redundancy scheme even ifthis were operated through the company.lko    The Redundancy Scheme in the London Docks following theJones/Aldington Report was financed from public funds and this was done under cover of the Appropriation Act without special powersbeing taken.    It would presumably be easier to copy this precedent in the Chrysler case if we gave the money to the Company to pay outin supplementation of statutory redundancy payments.    As I have mentioned earlier this may be an argument in favour of a scheme forlump sum payments.    On the other hand,   a continuing scheme for thepayment of different amounts to different individuals over differentperiods of time would presumably be very difficult to introduce underthe Appropriation Act.     I mention these points in some detailbecause it seems to me desirable that we should avoid a debate inParliament about the details of the  scheme and about why we were taking action in favour of one particular group of workers.15*    An alternative approach would be to recognise that we are going to have to face  situations like that at Chrysler from time totime in the future.    The shipbuilding industry may be the next.We could amend the Redundancy Payments Act so as to make it possiblefor me to introduce a special scheme in circumstances which wouldbe indicated in general terms in the legislation.    Such a powermight be made subject to a negative resolution in Parliament.Provided tho legal conditions were tightly enough drawn I do notthink it would put us under pressure to take action in many cases.Such a step would fit in well with our developing industrialstrategy.
(secret)Task Forcesl6.    In paragraph 9(ii)  of my earlier memorandum I suggestedsome kind of task force involving Government Departments andAgencies,   employers,   trade unions and local interests to co-ordinate action on the provision of alternative work,  retraining,redeployment,  mobility grants,   etc.    I suggest that such taskforces should be set up in both Linwood and Coventry.    In Linwood,particularly,  it might,  with advantage,  be headed by a Minister,but in any case there would be presentational advantages insaying that the working out of the redundancy scheme and theactivities of the task forces would be subject to the oversightof a specially-appointed group of Ministers from the Departmentsmainly concerned.    This  could be announced in general terms whenthe main Government decision is announced.Conclusions17.    I recommend to my colleagues that:(i)    if no money is put into Chrysler to keep the whole or part of the operation going,  we should say that theGovernment is ready to provide finace for a special redundancies-dancy scheme and that the details will be negotiated withthe unions concerned.    It is for consideration whether theannouncement  should name the amount of  30 million.(ii)    there should be further study by officials of the&apos;best way of providing legal cover,  including the possibilityof taking powers to cover future situations.(iii)    we should announce that task forces to co-ordinateaction on the redeployment of redundant workers are to beset up in Linwood and in Coventry under Ministerial direction.MFDepartment of EmploymentSW119 November  19755
