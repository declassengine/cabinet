UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government)75) 13325 November 1975CABINETSELECTIVE IMPORT CONTROLSCOLOUR TELEVISION TUBESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for industry. I dissented from the conclusion of MES(75) 14th Meeting thatno action should be taken to restrict imports of colour television tubespending clarification of the future of the Thorn plant at Skelmersdaleand of the possibility of a restructuring of the industry.    I now as^Cabinet to agree that colour television tubes should be included in theproposed announcement of import restrictions.2. The two United Kingdom colour television tube manufacturers -Thorn Colour Tubes (51 per cent Thorn, 49 per cent RCA) and Milliard(Philips) - have been hit hard by the fall in consumer demand for coloursets, coupled with a continuing high level of low-priced imports oftubes.3. Because of the heavy losses of Thorn Colour Tubes atSkelmersdale RCA have decided to pull out and Thorn will not continue on their own.    These decisions will not be affected by the relaxations tobe made to hire purchase and other credit controls.    Over 1, 000 jobsat Skelmersdale are at risk.    My Department, as agreed at IDV, isproviding financial support to keep the factory open for a few weeks whilethe possibility of a restructuring of the colour tube industry is explored.A restructuring could only be achieved with the co-operation of Philipsand we are discussing the possibilities with the Chairman of Philips (UK).4.        My anxiety is to prevent if at all possible the closure of the modern plant at Skelmersdale.    It represents an investment of over 15 million and provides jobs in an area of high male unemployment.5.        The preliminary report we have received from Philips indicates that there is significant structural over capacity in domestic tubemanufacture.   &quot;We shall put to Philips that the best means of dealing withthe over capacity while securing a viable industry for the future is that theyshould implement the plans they had to retire their older plant at Simonstone(near Burnley) and bring other work into this factory.    Production would thus be divided between Skelmersdale and the new Philips factory at Durham.131COPY NO
6. If Philips are to go along with this we shall have both to consider some financial help, eg in re-tooling where necessary and also some means of ensuring that the domestic set makers shift their tube purchases from imports to home produced tubes sufficiently to provide adequateloading for the United Kingdom tube factories.    Costs in this industry are particularly responsive to volume, and without a high throughput theUnited Kingdom plants could be at a cost disadvantage.7. In the course of the negotiations leading up to our arrangements with the Japanese the set makers agreed to purchase the bulk of theirtube requirements from domestic sources by January 1977.    But at thattime the future of Skelmersdale was not seriously in question.    In the changed circumstances this agreement can hardly be relied upon.8. The negotiations with Philips will not be easy.    I shall need to beable to show them that we mean to give every support to a viable UnitedKingdom capability.    They have plans to extend the range of their production to cover the bulk of the tube sizes now imported.    It wouldmake all the difference in securing the implementation of these plans ifthey could be backed up by import control covering the period of reorganisation.9. We are about to announce import restrictions on certain items atthe very time at which our negotiations about the future of Skelmersdalewill become known.    In these circumstances it would be quiteincomprehensible to both sides of the industry if control on imports ofcolour television tubes were not to figure in our announcement.10.       I ask my colleagues to agree, therefore, that colour televisiontubes should be included in the selective list of items for import control.E G V Department of Industry25 November 19752
