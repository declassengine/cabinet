CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 143COPY NO       o I3 December 1975 0 1CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1979-80Memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The Cabinet agreed to reduce expenditure in 1978-79 by 3f billion.    The Chief Secretary&apos;s report (annexed to C(75) 137) showsthat  2. 6 billion savings have so far been agread.    The Chief Secretary&apos;sreport lists further options which could yield a further  2. 3 billion.Ministers now need to select  1.15 billion from the list.2. It will be very difficult to find  1. 15 billion.    It will involve further reductions in sensitive programmes, and even programmes to which ministers attach very high priority could not be exempt.3. To assist discussion of how a further  1.15 billion of reductionsmight be made up, the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) has tried toset out a series of proposals.    It believes that these proposals reflect,so far as possible, ministers expressed priorities.    It concentrates on those programmes where it seems further savings might be found and doesnot attempt to cover every PESC heading.ROADS4. Large cuts in the expenditure on roads have already been agreed bythe Secretary of State so the remaining programmes are likely to be of hig jpriority on economic and environmental grounds.    But in the context of asearch for  3f billion and the large cuts which will have to be made in programmes to which even higher priority is attached (housing, health)further cuts may be needed.    At least  100 million should be sought here.FOOD SUBSIDIES %5. The Government is committed to phasing out food subsidies.Savings over and above those already agreed can be made by accelerating therate at which they are eliminated.    A reduction of  100 million in 1978-79could be achieved by bringing the run-down forward by one year from 1979-80.1
EDUCATION6. The Secretary of State for Education is prepared to accept the fullformula cuts (as part of a package totalling  3:f billion).   The scope foifurther cuts is limited, but it should be possible, without too damaging effects on educational policy, to obtain about half of the  124 million further savingsproposed by the Treasury (say around  60 million).    The most promisingareas appear to be:-a. the subsidy to overseas students, many of whom come fromrelatively rich countries is now very large (around  100 million).There is a strong case for raising tuition fees to 50 per cent ofeconomic costs (the upper range of increase being recommendedby the official group which has been studying the issue);b. over the PESC period further savings could be made in higher education staffing and other costs, which would allowstudent numbers to remain at the level achieved in 1977,(ie meeting 91 per cent of demand on the Robbins principle)without increasing unit costs;c. in-service training for teachers could be phased in moregradually.HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL services. In view of the increasing emphasis on community care, it seemsunwise to look for further reductions in personal social services.    But, inspite of the major problems faced by the health service, it is difficult, whenreductions of  3f billion are being sought, to justify increases of lj per cent per annum in this field.    The Secretary of State says that this is necessaryto meet demographic and technological change.    The number of elderly is increasing, but this must be to some extent compensated by the considerablylarger projected fall in the number of children (who are also significantconsumers of health services).    There can be no objectively JrightJ amountor quality of health provision.    Some demands for improved technology,and some public expectations, must always fail to be met.8.        If health expenditure were held at its 1975-76 level (in real terms )this would save a further  220 million in 1978-79.SOCIAL SECURITY\9. It has already been agreed by the Secretary of State that the upratingformula for 1976 could be adapted to give savings of some  200 million a year from 1977-78 to 1979-80.    But, because of the introduction of theGovernments counter-inflation policy  and the slower expected rise in prLces,even the modified formula agreed by the Secretary of State would still lea vepensioners in a better position than was planned in the last Public expenditure white Paper.    The main issue is whether the formula should be furtheradapted.    The amount at stake is a further  300 million a year.2
10.       It can well be argued that the Government could meet its commitment to give the pensioners a fair deal if the 1976 uprating kept pace with theincrease in gross earnings since July 1974 (when the  10/ 16 pension rates were introduced).    This would still leave pensions arising faster than gross earnings and considerably faster than real take-home pay from the time theGovernment took office to the end of the PESC period.11.       But if the uprating formula for 1976 were further modified in the waysuggested above, there would be a strong case - on grounds of substance and presentation - for adopting some of the options (costing under  100 million per year) for helping the most hard pressed which are being put forward bythe Official Group on Financial Poverty.    These two changes would yielda net saving of  215- 250 million.HOUSING12.       All the formula reductions in public expenditure on housing( 130 million) are agreed by the Secretary of State.    Of the policy optionsin the survey, a further reduction in subsidies of  76 million is agreed;and of the additional options referred to in the Chief Secretary!s  report,reductions of  100 million are agreed ( 47 million on private improvement grants, and  53 million on sals3 of local authority houses).    Agreedreductions thus total  306 million.   Not agreed are reductions of 838 million made up as follows:- million 1978-79Further OptionsPolicy Options    originally suggestedin Survey by TreasurySubsidiesHousebuildingApprovalsSales of LocalAuthority HousesLocal Authoritymortgage lending,municipal! s ati on s,improvement oveme ntinvestmentTotal124(11, 000 houses)155176(16, 000 houses)137246370468Total155300(27, 000 houses)13724683813.Subsidies.    It is difficult to announce reductions in subsidies to localauthority housing considerably bigger than those accepted by the Secretary ofState without the announcement of concomitant measures in the owner-occupied sector.    These have to await the outcome of the Housing FinanceReview.    Meanwhile, however, it is equally difficult to achieve the 3^ million overall reduction aimed at by Ministers without some furthermodest contribution from housing subsidies.    The Secretary of State has
agreed that rents should be raised in real terms by 30p-40p per week in1977-78 and by the same again in 1978-79.    If that range was raised to40p-50p for both years, there would be an additional saving of  50 million in 1978-79.    The rent increases would not be significantly greater in scale than those the Secretary of State has already accepted and rents would stillbe below 1971 levels in real terms.14.       Capital Expenditure.    The remaining items in the table above all \concern capital expenditure of one kind or another.    In this ai*e*a the leastdamage to the Governments housing and other objectives would result from increased sales of local authority houses.    For the increased sales tocontribute towards the  3^ billion it would be necessary for the sales to be financed by the private sector and not by local authorities.    An additional contribution of  50 million from this source need not lead to a significant reduction in the local authority housing stock in areas where there is ashortage of rented accommodation provided the sales were concentrated on other areas.15.       The next least damaging option is probably to reduce the provisionfor mortgage lending by local authorities.    A start has already been madein persuading building societies to take over this responsibility from localauthorities.    At least  100 million more might be saved in 1978-79 on this item (out of a total provision of  393 million gross).16.       Finally, to help achieve the  3f billion target a further saving( 100 -  150 million) might, without excessive damage, be found from theother capital programmes (housebuilding, municipalisation, improvement).In the allocation of the  125 million between these three programmes, thereare good reasons for arguing that the brunt should be borne by new house-building.    The decline of the private rented sector has led to the decay of much of the accommodation in that sector.    There is an urgent need tomaintain that accommodation through the municipalisation programme.And in present circumstances better value for money can often be obtained by acquiring and improving existing houses than by new building.    The reis, however, the presentational problem that public attention tends to focuson the total numbers of new houses even though this is no indication ofsuccess or failure in meeting the most urgent housing needs.OVERSEAS SERVICES17,       The full formula cuts could be applied to Overseas Services andthey could be concentrated on the Overseas Representation sub-head.Expenditure on Overseas Services as a whole has fallen by about 15 per centin real terms during the last 10 years; but on Overseas Representation ithas risen by about 25 per cent in real terms.    We maintain a largeroverseas presence than our principal competitors find necessary and weseem less ready than they to concentrate our overseas efforts, includingexport promotion, on areas where we have major interests at stake.    the size and standards of our overseas posts are at present the subject of some public criticism.    The savings here could be some  10 million.4
OVERSEAS AID18.       When all other public expenditure programmes are being cut it isdifficult to justify the complete exemption of the Overseas Aid Programme.The Government has accepted in principle the United Nations target of1.7 per cent of GNP for official development assistance.    But, togetherwith other major donors, it has not said when it expects that target to bereached;  there is certainly no commitment to reach it by 1980.    Ourpresent figure of 0. 38 per cent is above the OECD average (0. 35 per cent)and above that of the USA.    There is no prospect of the OECD countriesachieving the target during the PESC period.    Our relations withdeveloping countries would not be seriously damaged if Overseas Aidcontinues to expand (in real terms) but at the lower rate (1. 3 per cent)implied by the formula cuts.    On the other hand the Government hascommitted itself to a generous aid policy and to a more equitable sharingof wealth between rich countries and poor.    The application of full formulacuts would yield about  50 million.    If Ministers felt that past commit-ments have imposed an overriding moral obligation, the formula could beapplied at half rate and the savings would then be  25 million.DEFENCE19.       Whether or not the Defence Review could, by adopting a differentapproach, have produced greater savings in planned defence expenditure,to announce further major cuts so soon after its conclusion could call intoquestion our reliability as an ally and might carry the risk of encouragingother members of NATO to follow suit.    However, this argument applieswith less force to equipment than to &quot;front line&quot; manpower and it shouldbe possible to go further than the Secretary of State for Defence hasoffered, perhaps by an additional  75- 100 million in 1978-79, withoutreneging on our commitments to NATO.    For example, it should bepossible to meet the RAF&apos;s requirement for a future fighter aircraftmore cheaply than the air defence variant of the MRCA and the MaritimeHarrier could be cancelled.CONCLUSIONS20        The above paragraphs can be summarised as follows:-  millionRoads 100Food Subsidies 100Education 60Health 220Social Security 235Housing 325Overseas Representation 10Overseas Aid 25Defence 751, 150
21.       As set out, the proposals show the largest extra reductions in thehigh priority areas of health, social security and housing.    In considering this, Ministers should bear in mind;-a. if larger reductions than those shown above can be secured in such lower priority areas as roads, education and defence,then the need for savings on higher priority programmes will bethat much less;b. housing and social security have shown very large increases in recent years;  these, and health, as high priority programmes,have inevitably contributed a relatively small proportion of the 2. 6 billion savings made so far;c. perhaps the most difficult judgment is how big a reductioncan safely be made in the defence programme;d. even if substantially larger savings than those shown abovecould be secured in defence and other programmes, some further reductions in such sensitive areas as healthy social security and housing would still be unavoidable if  3f billion reduction is to besecured.22.       These proposals are put forward as a basis for discussion of thecentral issues.    The final judgments are political decisions which onlyMinisters can take, and they will undoubtedly wish to increase some itemsand reduce others within the total.Cabinet Office3 December 19756
