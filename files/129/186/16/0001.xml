DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 141 COPY NO2 December 1975CABINETCHRYSLER:  THE MANPOWER IMPLICATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for EmploymentLABOUR MARKET1. This note examines, as requested by Cabinet, the implications formanpower of a close-down of Chrysler activities.    The Company has not provided details of the proposed rundown programme in the event ofGovernment deciding not to provide financial assistance for the continuation of all or part of the activities of Chrysler UK.    Chrysler have merelyindicated that the rundown if it proceeded in an orderly way would becompleted in three months.    In practice the likelihood of the workforceo ccupying plants is extremely high and any detailed programme of rundownwould be wholly speculative.2. Chrysler currently employs over 24, 000 workers at elevenestablishments in Great Britain (see Annex A).    Of these, 14, 300 areemployed in the West Midlands (the vast majority in Coventry) and 6, 600at Linwood in Scotland.    The remaining 3, 400 are in the South East,predominantly in the Luton area.    Over 20 per cent of the labour forceconsists of skilled workers.3. It is difficult to be precise about other jobs involved but broadly,apart from the jobs in Chrysler, it is estimated that for every two jobs in motor vehicles manufacture there are three jobs in the component and supply industries.    In addition, the 800 or so Chrysler dealers employsome 30, 000 people altogether.    Not all of these various groups would bemade redundant if Chrysler were to close.    Initially the entire Chryslerworkforce and a great many of the corresponding 36, 000 or so incomponent and supply industries would be unemployed but considerably less than half of those employed by the distributors would be affected.If other United Kingdom manufacturers were to take up two-thirds ofChrysler1 s current market share (roughly in line with their presentproportion of the whole market) it is estimated that job losses would be55, 000 initially reducing to half that number within a year.    If import controls were introduced job losses would be still further reduced.    Therewould be secondary job losses resulting from the loss of income among those made redundant.1
4. Linwood, in the Paisley area, and Coventry would be the placesmost acutely affected by closure.    If all those redundant from Chryslerwent onto the unemployment register or found work by displacing otheiworkers, the male rates would soar to 17 per cent in Paisley (12.5 per centmen and women together) and to 13, 8 per cent at Coventry (11, 5 per centtotal) (see Annex B),    Nor would there be good prospects in either areaof an early return to the present position of levels of unemployment near the national average.    Employment prospects in the neighbouring areas to Paisley are bad and, in the light of the anticipated contraction in the shipbuilding industry, will worsen.    The increase in unemployment islikely to be persistent, even with an upturn in the economy,    Linwood isheavily dependent on Chrysler as its major employer.    In Coventry,normally a prosperous area but relatively hard hit in the present recession,other large firms in the vehicle manufacturing, telephone equipment and machine tool industries are also faced with large current or impendingredundancies.    Although the outlook is less bleak than in Paisley, a high level of unemployment is likely to persist until the engineering industrystarts to pick up again.5.        This does not mean that the ex-Chiysler employees would allremain unemployed.    Given their skills and work experience perhaps70 per cent of them would find work in six months, even in Scotland, butthis would be at the expense of other workers who would be forced intounemployment.    Among the Chrysler workers, skilled workers wouldprobably fare best and older workers (an estimated 1, 700 Chrysleremployees are aged over 60) would have most difficulty in findingalternative work.6. Less severe problems would be experienced in Birmingham and anumber of other &quot;West Midlands towns through job losses at componentfirms.    As in Coventry, recovery is likely to be related largely to thegeneral level of activity in engineering.7. It would appear, therefore, on present assumptions about the economy, that it could be one to two years before local unemploymentlevels recovered from a Chrysler closure.    On the other hand, therewould be increases in employment in other places (but not in Scotland) ifthe British-based motor industry was successful in seizing a part of Chrysler&apos;s lost sales.COST OF UNEMPLOYMENT8. On the assumption (see paragraph 3) that 55, 000 jobs (mostly male)were lost initially and the loss persisted for a year, the cost in terms ofpublic expenditure would be approximately  150 million excluding the costof any special publicly-financed redundancy scheme.    Of this total,approximately  10 million might be accounted for by the Exchequer share of statutory redundancy payments, a further  80 million by social security
payments, and the rest, or  60 million, by revenue loss, ie income tax and national insurance contributions,,    A special  30 million redundancyscheme would bring the cost up to  180 million.    In a situation where joblosses had declined to say 30, 000 (see paragraph 3) the cost would be atan annual rate of  115 million.9. The consequences of closure beyond the first year are very difficultto state.    The prospect, however, is for accelerated reabsorption of thejobless back into employment as activity in the motor and engineering industries gathers pace.    Costs in the second year would be very much lower than in the first year,10.       It should not of course be inferred that it would necessarily be right to inject money into Chrysler up to the amount of the unemploymentcost, regardless of viability.    If the operation does not become viable,there will eventually be unemployment costs to be met anyway.    Moreover,a good deal of the industry^ capacity is working on narrow margins andwill remain vulnerable for some years.    To support Chrysler maymerely create redundancies later on with another maker who would have sustained employment had Chrysler&apos;s competition not been there.    Thereal effect of closing Chrysler on employment, balance of payments and production is thus any difference between the effects of closure now and ofa closure in a few years1 time.    It is impossible to say what the differencewould be but it is likely to be small.M department of Employment2 December 19753
