OOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 137 COPY NO       8128 November 1975CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1979-80Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. At our meeting on 13 November, we agreed that a reduction in public expenditure of  3, 750 million should be made in 1978-79.    The chief secretary, Treasury, was invited to discuss bilaterally with spendingMinisters the contributions which would be needed from their programmes.I was also asked to arrange for consultations with the Trades UnionCongress (TUC).Zf The outcome of the Chief Secretary^ discussions with spendingMinisters is summarised in his report which is attached.    I will make an oral report on my consultations with the TUC.3. The White Paper is already overdue.    Even when we have takendecisions on all programmes, we have to translate these decisions into a detailed White Paper of the usual kind, with commentaries which willexplain and justify the difficult decisions we have had to takea    this process, with the subsequent printing, Cabinet approval and publication,takes about eight weeks.    Thus on the most optimistic assumption, thefull White Paper cannot come out until February.    We must therefore take decisions on programmes as soon as possible.4. The Cabinet have already accepted the need to reduce expenditure by 3f billion in 1978-79.    The bilateral discussions have produced agreedsavings in that year of  2. 6 billion.    So  1.15 billion further savings arestill to be found.5. The following summary table presents the nature of the decisionsrequired in simple form.    It will be seen that the disputed items and otheroptions together total over  2.3 billion, or twice the additional savingsrequired.    There is thus substantial scope for choice according to the priorities which Cabinet prefers.

In finding these additional savings for 1978-79, we must also ensurethat the savings in 1977-78 and 1979-80 are no less than the totals indicatedin the illustrative list in Annex B of C(75) 117.
7, I therefore invite my colleagues -i. To confirm the reductions already agreed (Table 1 of theChief Secretary&apos;s report),ii. To select a sufficient number of items from Tables 2 and 3together so as to produce the  1.15 billion still needed in 1978-79,and to yield total savings in 1977-78 and 1979-80 not less than thoseindicated in C(75) 117.D W treasury Chambers28 November 1975
report by the chief  secretary the following notes  and tables  summarise the outcome of my bilateradiscussions with spending ministers.     table  1 lists the  elementswhich have been  agreed from the previous  illustrative list  inc(75)H7 together with additional items  agreed.     table 2 listselements in the illustrative list which are disputed.     table 3  sets out  further items which might be substituted.if the cabinet  agreenot to  make some of the cuts  in table .2.     the table in paragraph 5of the  chancellor&apos;s paper summarises  the broad  figuring.2.    the position on the main programmes  is  as  follows.a) health and personal  social  services the secretary of state&apos;s position is that provision should be madefor total  capital  and current   expenditure  to rise  at a year onhospital  and community services  and at  2%  a year on personal  social services.     this would mean that  the  aggregate reductions under theformula in 1978/79  (which does not  apply to the family practitionerservices,   drugs,   food and medical  stores in hospitals  and social service homes),   would be reduced for england from  388 million by 255 million.savings in wales would similarly be reduced from  23 million by 15 million.     in scotland  26  mijllion of the formula cuts of 51 million on the health programme  are unacceptable to  the  secretoof state.     the total net  savings  secured under the forrrrula for healand personal  social  services for great britain would then amount  to 166 million in  1978/79,   i nstead of  462 million.     none of theministers was willing to  accept  an increase in prescription charges which wo\ild have saved  20  million in  1978/79.b) social  security the secretary of state considers that  the only areas  for securing
savings  in the social  security programme which  are in principleacceptable woLild be -1978/79  million(l) to curtail  students&apos;   rights to  supplementary benefit  in return for minor improvement  instudent grants 15  (net)(2) to revoke the increase in the  earnings rulelimit which -was carried against us by theOpposition- if  enacted with effect  from 1 April   1976 55 - 65or- if enacted with  effect  from 1  April   1977 - l8(Colleagues are considering separately how the necessary Bill can be fitted into thelegislative programme)(3) to hold the 1976 uprating to the movement whichwill have taken place in gross earnings,   as 508moderated by counter-inflation policy,   since the IO/16 pension was introduced in July 197^.(This is  a saving which could be made from theunannounced programme in the Survey Report,  butit  is not one which it would be  sensible toannounc e).But the Secretary of State is not prepared to  seek the whole amountof the saving in (3)   above.     She wishes  also to keep open the option of offsetting against the saving such extra  expenditure as wouldvcsult from adopting propositions from the report of the inter-tlepartmental  group  on financial poverty,   which is  to be discussed by
the appropriate Cabinet  Committee.     Whatever is  decided on thosepropositions,   however,   I understand that the Secretary of State isprepared to  envisage a net  saving under  (3)   of no more  than 200- 3O0 million.c)    Roads,   transport,   housing,   environmental  and common services the Secretary of  State for the Environment has  accepted all theformula cuts on these programmes.     So have the Secretaries of Statefor Scotland and Wales,  with  a fur-ther  2 million from the latter&apos;programme of environmental  services in preference to  further optionselsewhere.     These amount to  726 million.Among further options,   the Secretaries of State  accepted thefollowing:England      Scotland      Wales(or GB)Roads,   car parks  and local  authoritytransport  administration 90 - british Rail l40(GB)Housing Rents 60 12 kNew house building - 10 -Housing sales 50 - kHousing - private sector improvement-grants 36 7 3Environmental  research 5 - -Community land 15(GB)        -396 29 1^If the total of savings from this group of programmes is to be raisedfurther the two main areas for consideration are housing and roads.-3-
As regards housing,   the Secretary of State  for the Environmentconsiders that  the total provision for new housebuilding  should not be subject  to  any reduction.     He also  argues that  there  should beno limit;   this would mean that we would continue with no  controlover this programme,  whatevei- its estimated level.     The  Secretaryof State is  also opposed to  further increases in rents beyond thosehe has accepted  ( 30-&apos;i0p per week in real terms in  1977/78 and thesame again in  1978/79)   unless  there were conesponding  action onrelief of tax on mortgage interest.     He  also opposes   any reductionin local  authorities&apos;   mortgage lending,   municipalisation,   and improvement  of local  authorities&apos;   housing,   and any further  sales ofhouses beyond those which he has  accepted.As regards roads,   the  Secretaries of  State  for the Environment  andfor Scotland are opposed to  further reductions.     The   Secretary ofState for Wales regards completion of the M4 as of the highest priority.d)   Education,  libraries,   science and artsThe Secretary of State for Education has agreed to find the fullformula cuts of  517 million on education  and  9 million on the  artprovided that  the cuts on other programmes make up the rest  of the 3f billion.If, however, further savings are sought from his programme in makinup the total,  he has  expressed firm opposition.Ike Secretary of State for Scotland regards it as impracticable tofind  4 million of the formula cuts on his education programme, sothat he would be finding savings of  ^7 million.The Secretary of State for Wales is finding the full formula cuts of  16 million.
e)   Law and order the Home  Secretary and the  Secretary of State for Scotland have sought to meet  the formula cuts without turning  away recruits tothe police forces up to their authorised establishments,  while atthe same time making the  criteria for increasing  an establishment  somuch tighter that this will be allowed from now on only in most exceptional  circumstances.     In consequence the  effect on the rest  ofthe laiv and order programmes was  severe.     Even when only one newprison is allowed to he started,  the Home Secretary has felt unableto find  3^.9 million of the full formula cut  of  l46.5 million,made up as follows:  million(i) Police manpower 6.2(ii) Police  equipment  and buildings 6.3(iii) Fire  service current   expenditure(borne by local authorities with rate 10.8support  grant)(iv) Prisons current expenditure on overtime 2.4(v) Prison works 6.0(vi) Probation 3.2The Secretary of State for Scotland similarly has felt unable tofind  l-g- million net  of the formula cut,   including  0.4 million forhis part of the urban programme.    The Home Secretary has not regarded it as his departmental responsibility to seek  to recover  from the cuts 5.7 million for the xirban programme in England and Vales.     TheLord Chancellor has found, his  full share -  3.2 million - of theformula cuts.
f) Northern IrelandNotwithstanding the need to  accommodate additional  expenditurethroughout  the period on law and order,   the  Secretary of State for northern Ireland has found the full   amount of the formula cuts,   andin 1978/79  a further  7 million which balances  excess  expenditurein the preceeding years.g) Food siibsidi esThe Secretary of State has  agreed a reduction of  30 million in1978/79 as a first  stage in the  elimination of food subsidies by1979/80   (except  for those paid under the CAP).     She  said that  thefurther option of  100 million in Table 3 went  further than  she could accept,  but if progress could be made in restraining CAP price increases  she would consider a further reduction of  50 million.h) Agriculture  and fisheries the Minister has  found the full  formula cuts of  l4.8 million.i) industry the Secretary of State has  agreed reductions in the telecommunicationsinvestment programme,   industrial research and development  and in the uk contribution to the European Space Agency.     These total  88.4 million in 1978/79.He has also drawn attention to the phasing of funds for the national enterprise Board on which no decision has yet been reached.     TheTreasury1 s figures notionally spread the statutory cash provision( lOOOm)   over  a period of five years.     After deducting an NEBcontribution covering half the  estimated needs of British Leylandplus  40m for Rolls Royce in 1976/77,   this would leave  l25m .a year for all the NEB1 s other activities.
The Secretary of  State  for  Industry considers  that  a realistic  sumshould be provided for Rolls  Royce:   the company have recentlyestimated their requirements  at  350 million,   including launchingaid,  over the period.     He believes that  separately from the provisionfor British Leyland and Rolls Royce a  sum of  200 million  a year is needed for the not&apos;s other activities  for them to have  any credibilityin terms of Government policy.I see the force of this.     But  the fact is that  it  is not practicableat this  stage to  produce forecasts  of not  expenditure which willsatisfy  everybody,   or could even he soundly based.     So the bestanswer,   I believe,  would be to publish a completely flat  run of figures,   covering all not  activities of well over  200 million  a year:in short to  adopt  a largely conventional  presentation.     The drafting of the White Paper would underline the uncertainties in the situation.j)    Def enc eThe issue to be resolved is whether the Secretary of State  for defence should be asked to  secure the full  civil  formula reductionsas the defence contribution to the total cut.     In bilateral discussionhe said that he was  only willing to find  savings of  100 million ineach of the years  1977/78  to   1979/80,   of which  60 million in  eachyear had been identified so far.    Further reductions of  120 million in 1977/78,    350 million in 1978/79 and  430 million in 1979/80 would thus be needed to correspond with the civil  formula cuts.^    Overseas  services  and AidOn Overseas Representation and Overseas Information FCO ministers have offered reductions of only y/a.    On Overseas  Aid,   the minister has refused to accept  any part of the formula cuts  (which involve areduction of  4-9 million in 1978/79).    He has indeed indicated that the
prospect  is  that  he will be  seeking  further increases  in the aid programme in order to reach by 1980 the UN 0.7% target.    This wouldinvolve broadly a doubling of the existing programme,   which,   taking account of the  formula cuts,   stands  at   45&apos;lm in  1979/80*     If either of these courses were adopted,   the Cabinet would need to findalternative  savings  elsewhere.
