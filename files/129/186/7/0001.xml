At their meeting on 20 November, the Social Services Committee (SS)considered proposals by the Secretary of State for Social Services for legislation on the separation of private practice from National health service (NHS) hospitals.   They took the view that the- subject was of such importance that their conclusions should be reported to the Cabinet and endorsed by them before any action was taken.The Secretary of State is caught between two fires.   On the one hand thereare the doctors, ydio are in a highly militant mood and, since SS Committeemet,.are reported to have.threatened to take industrial action unless thewhole question of pay beds and private practice is referred to the RoyalCommission on the NHS.   The Secretary of State argued to SS Committee thatthe doctors were unlikely to accept the principle of phasing out pay beds -jor to engage in meaningful discussions about methods of controlling theprivate sector until legislation had reached the Statute Book.   On theother hand there are the NHS trade unions, amongst whose members feelingsagainst pay beds is running high.   The danger is that, in the absence of early legislation, they will take the law into their own hands and bringabout phasing out de.facto by industrial action.- In.these circumstances the Secretary of State argued, and SS Committee--  endorsed her view, that the best course would be to introduce and enactas soon as possible a short Bill containing four main provisions:i.     The establishment beyond doubt of the power of the Secretaryof State to phase out pay beds from NHS hospitals.copy NO8THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 13224 November 1975CABINETSEPARATION OP PRIVATE PRACTICE from national HEALTH SERVICE HOSPITALSMemorandum by&apos; the Lorci President of the Council
ii. The fixing of a timetable for phasing out.   The basic requirementwould be for completion within one year of the enactment of the Bill,but with a discretion for the Secretary of State to allow private practice to continue for a further two years where exceptional circumstances could be established.iii. Reaffirmation of the right of an NHS consultant who wished to doso to engage in private practice outside the NHS.iv. A simple control power under which anyone who wished to providea private hospital of more than 75 beds would have to obtain a licencefrom the Secretary of State.   This v/ould be only a stopgap measure andwould not be a substitute for the much more thorough and flexiblecontrols outlined in the consultative document on which consultantsare now proceeding.   But it would in the interim period give the NHSthe essential protection it needs, bearing in mind that there are knownto be a number of proposals for major new private hospitals, some ofwhich, if they came to fruition, could do serious harm to the NHS.It was the fourth of these proposals which SS Committee regarded as most opento argument.   They were very conscious that while on phasing out pay bedsThe Queen&apos;s Speech indicated that legislation v/ould be introduced in thecourse of the Session, on the question of powers for controlling the private sector it merely said that consultations would, continue on the proposals inthe consultative.document.   It is arguable that if early legislation is introduced dealing with controls.as well as phasing out, the doctors will saythat the G-overnment is acting in bad faith by anticipating the outcome ofthe discussions arising from the consultative document.There are two answers to this. The first is that the Secretary of State-willnot announce her intention to legislate, still less introduce the Bill, untilshe has offered the doctors consultations and - assuming they take up theoffer - has informed them of her proposals and listened to, and taken accountof, their views. Thus there will have been consultations. Secondly, this isonly a stopgap measure.. The discussions on the control proposals in the consultative document will go on and will - as the Cabinet envisaged when they2
discussed the matter on 23 October (CC(75) 44th Conclusions, Minute 2) -lead to the introduction of a later Bill, perhaps next Session, which will replace the rough-and-ready stopgap provision with a much more sophisticatedcontrol regime.On this basis SS Committee concluded that the balance of advantage favouredacceptance of the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals and that a Bill should beintroduced and enacted as soon as possible.   It was made clear to theCommittee that, since this Bill is at present only in the priority reservecategory, it will probably be necessary, in order to accommodate it, to drop some other Bill now in the programme,I invite the Cabinet to consider the conclusions reached by S3 Committee.The Secretary of State for Social Services will no doubt be able to reporton the latest developments on the doctors&apos; side, particularly in relationto their demand that the whole matter should be referred to the RoyalCommission,ESPrivy Council Office24 November 19753
