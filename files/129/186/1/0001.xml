DEVELOPMENTS IN THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIESAPRIL-OCTOBER 1975Section I.  introduction the Select Committee on European Community Secondary legislation in its second report of the 1972-73 session asked the Government to makea report to Parliament each six months on e.c. matters. The government accepted this recommendation and the first report was presented toParliament in November 1974(&apos;). The report on renegotiationC2) presented to Parliament in March 1975 covered developments between November andthe end of March. This present report records developments during theperiod April to October 1975 and in addition supplements the report onrenegotiation in certain respects. It deals with developments in the threeEuropean Communities the European Economic Community, the european coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community.Major developments in the process of political co-operation between the Gov-eraments of the Nine are described and an account is given of the handling of e.c. affairs in Parliament. The aim is to cover decisions reached bythe European Communities during the period and give an account of majorwork in progress. There are other topics under discussion which will find their place in future reports when they have reached an appropriate stage.2. For the United Kingdom the most important occurrence was the vote in the Referendum on 5 June 1975 throughout the United kingdom in favour of remaining in the European Communities. 17-4 million votes(67 per cent) were cast in favour: 8-5 million were against. On 9 june the Prime Minister made a statement in the House of Commons in whichhe said that the Government intended to play a full and constructive partin all Community policies and activities. The full text of the statement is at Annex A.3. At the first meeting of the Council of Ministers after the referendum,the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary explained the Government^approach to the Community. He stated that the British aim would be tostrengthen the Community and to use it as an instrument for good for the member States and for the world. The full text of his statement is at annex B.4. Following the Referendum verdict the Parliamentary Labour Partydecided to nominate Members to the European Assembly who took up their places for the first time at the Plenary Session of the Assembly on7-11 July. In September following consultation with the TUC, candidateswere put forward to fill the eight vacancies for employees&apos; representatives on the Economic and Social Committee of the Communities and theCouncil confirmed their appointment on 15 September. The two vacancieson the Economic and Social Committee for employers&apos; representatives andthe one vacancy for a representative of other interests have also now beenfilled.(&apos;) Cmnd. 5790.(2) Cmnd. 6003.
Section II.   Political Co-operation5. At their meeting in Paris in December 1974, Heads of CommunityGovernments &quot; reaffirmed their determination gradually to adopt commonpositions and co-ordinate their diplomatic action in all areas of inter-national affairs which affect the interests of the European Community&quot;;and at the meeting of the Council of Ministers on 24 June 1975, theSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs expressed thehope that the Nine Countries would increasingly act as one in their relationswith the outside world. Action to achieve this aim continues to be carriedout in the framework for &quot; political co-operation &quot; amongst the Nine.6. A long-standing and effective exercise in political co-operation was brought to completion with the third and final stage of the Conferenceon Security and Co-operation in Europe held in Helsinki from 30 July to1 August. The common strategy and day-to-day tactics developed amongthe Nine made a substantial contribution to the success of the Conferenceand to the quality and importance of the Final Act(3). The Nine member governments intend to continue to co-ordinate their approach to the implementation and monitoring of the decisions of the Conference and the preparations for the review meeting to be held in Belgrade in 1977.7. The Nine increasingly adopt common positions at the united nations on political and economic matters. Co-ordination between member states at the Seventh Special Session of the United Nations general assembly in September 1975 was one of the most elaborate exercises ofits kind ever undertaken for a major international meeting see paragraph20 below.8. The Nine Governments aim to build a constructive relationship withthe Arab States by increasing co-operation in a wide range of fields throughthe &quot;Euro-Arab dialogue&quot;. Experts from the two sides met in Cairo inJune 1975 and in Rome in July, and discussions have begun in the fields of industrialisation; infrastructure; agriculture and rural development;financial co-operation; trade; scientific and technological co-operation;cultural co-operation and labour and social questions.9. The Nine Governments have kept in close touch on the situation in cyprus and have made several collective demarches in Athens, Nicosia andAnkara. Developments in the Middle East have also been kept under constant review; and Member States exchange views on a wide variety of day-to-day foreign policy problems.Section III.  External Relations: Trade and AidMultilateral Trade Negotiations10. The Community represented by the Commission negotiates as asingle unit in the GATT multilateral trade negotiations, which are aimed at the expansion and liberalisation of world trade. The Commission actswithin the mandate agreed by the Council of Ministers in February 19750;(3) Grand. 6198.(4) Cmnd. 6003, paragraph 84.
in addition there are regular co-ordination meetings among Member states to consider and determine the Community position on particular issues.11. The negotiations got effectively under way in the Spring following the passage of the United States Trade Act at the beginning of 1975. Initialdiscussions have been taking place in Geneva in a number of groups dealingwith different types of barriers to trade. It has been agreed that particular attention should be paid to problems facing the developing countries.Tropical products are being treated as a priority area and proposals fromthe developing countries are currently being examined.Mediterranean Countries12. On 11 May 1975 the Community signed a new trade agreementwith Israel, the first to be completed since the Community decided toadopt an &quot; overall approach &quot; to relations with the countries of the Mediter-ranean basin. The new agreement came into force on 1 July. It will improve the opportunities for United Kingdom exports to Israel and reduceCommunity tariffs on imports of certain Israeli foodstuffs which are ofimportance to the United Kingdom and other Community countries.Negotiations are continuing for the conclusion of the agreements withAlgeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Malta; and Member States are consideringthe content of a mandate for negotiations with Egypt, Syria, Lebanon andJordan.13. At its meeting on 6 October 1975, the Council of Ministers con-sidered the implications of recent events in Spain for the Community&apos;s negotiations with that country for a new trade agreement, and noted thatfor the time being negotiations could not be resumed.Greece. 14. Greece has applied for full membership of the European Com-munities. The United Kingdom, like other Member States, has welcomedthis application. In accordance with Article 237 of the e.c. Treaty,which provides that any European State may apply to become a memberof the Community, the Commission will prepare an opinion on the applica-tion on which it is now at work.Portugal15. Considerable progress has been made during the last six months in negotiating a new and wider trade agreement between the community and Portugal. In October 1975, the Council of Ministers decided inprinciple that the Community should provide emergency financial aid to portugal for development projects. The necessary interest rate subsidies and guarantees will be borne on the Community budget.Canada16. Member States are currently considering proposals from theCommission for the negotiation of a framework agreement for economicand commercial co-operation between the Community and Canada.
State Trading Countries17. In November 1974 the Community transmitted to the Governmentsof Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the German Democratic Republic, Hungary,Poland, Romania and the Soviet Union, as a proposed basis for negotiation,the outlines of the type of trade agreement which might be concludedbetween them and the Community. Formal replies are awaited from theGovernments concerned. It is the intention that new trade agreementsnegotiated by the Community as a whole will in due course replace the bilateral agreements negotiated by individual Member States which havevirtually all been terminated. Individual Member States are still free tonegotiate bilateral agreements on industrial co-operation subject only toa consultation procedure.World Trade in Commodities18. Recent Community work on trade in commodities has been stronglyinfluenced by the ideas on world economic interdependence put forward bythe United Kingdom at the Conference of Commonwealth Heads ofGovernment at Kingston in May 1975(5).19. In July the Council of Ministers agreed to a common Communityposition for its guidance at international meetings, with a view to makinga constructive contribution to the international dialogue on developmentco-operation. This included a number of guidelines for international trade,and gave evidence of the Community&apos;s readiness to look at individual commodities case by case to see what measures, such as commodity agreements, could be applied in order to limit excessive price fluctuations.The Community also expressed its willingness to promote, and participate in, international action to deal with the problem of instability in the export earnings of developing countries.20. As a result of this preparatory work, the Community was able tomake a major contribution to the discussion on development and inter-national economic co-operation at the Seventh Special Session of theUnited Nations General Assembly from 1-16 September. The member states worked closely together at this meeting: their cohesion played animportant part in ensuring that the Session ended with a consensusresolution on various subjects of concern to developing countries.The Lome Convention21. The Lome Convention(6) was signed in February 1975 between theCommunity and 46 developing countries (including 22 members of theCommonwealth) in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific (the ACPcountries). Its trade provisions were brought into effect on 1 July, givingthe 46 developing signatories better access to the markets of the Nine;similar benefits were extended to most of the United Kingdom&apos;s remainingdependent territories. In the context of the Convention, special measures have been taken in respect of beef from Botswana and other: traditional(5) Cmnd. 6061.(6) Cmnd. 6003, paragraphs 87-88.
suppliers to the United Kingdom; measures have also been taken to safe-guard access for Caribbean rum to the United Kingdom and to the other member States, with opportunities for increased sales.22. Aid to the ACP countries will be available from the new EuropeanDevelopment Fund when the Convention comes into force on completionof the ratification procedures, probably in the first few months of 1976.The United Kingdom is expected to ratify in the near future. In themeantime preparatory work has begun including visits by Commissionexperts to the ACP countries to ensure that disbursements can commenceswiftly once the Convention comes into effect. Discussions are being held to work out similar arrangements for dependent territories.Other Aspects of Community Aid Policy23. Development Ministers of the Nine met on 13 October 1975 to resume consideration of outstanding aid issues, including aid to developing countries other than the ACP countries, increased food aid and the Com-munity&apos;s general follow-up to the World Food Conference, and theharmonisation and co-ordination of Community and Member States&apos;policies. Agreement was not reached on these issues but discussion willcontinue.Generalised Scheme of Preferences24. The Community&apos;s Scheme on Generalised Preferences for importsfrom developing countries is an important instrument of policy for develop-ment co-operation; it is particularly significant for the developing Common-wealth countries of Asia. A number of important tropical products were included in the Scheme for the first time on 1 July 19750- In accordancewith the Council of Ministers&apos; resolution in March that steady improve-ments of the Scheme should continue, discussions are in progress on thearrangements for generalised preferences in 1976. The proposals putforward by the Commission lay emphasis on improvements of particular interest to the poorest developing countries, including the countries of theIndian sub-continent.Textiles25. The Community has concluded agreements under the GATT Multi-fibre Arrangement with India, Pakistan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Macao.Negotiations are under way or due to begin soon with all its other majorsuppliers of low cost textiles.Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreements26. Non-preferential trade and economic co-operation agreements were concluded in July 1975 with Sri Lanka and with Mexico. Their provisions are similar to those of the agreement signed by the Community with indian 1973.(7) Cmnd. 6003, paragraph 89.5162620 &apos;   B*
ban27. There are continuing discussions between the Community and Iranon how they should achieve their aim of a special relationship, most recentlyin talks between the Iranian Foreign Minister and the Commission on9-10 October 1975.Section IV.  Agriculture and Fisheries28. The United Kingdom has continued actively to seek improvements inthe Common Agricultural Policy, in order in particular to discourage theproduction of surpluses and to keep down costs generally.Stocktaking Report29. At their meetings in March and April 1975, the Council of ministers had preliminary discussions on a report from the Commission on the stock-taking of the Common Agricultural Policy(8). The report has since beenunder examination by officials and was considered again by Ministers at aspecial Council devoted entirely to the subject on 29-30 October, at whichthe United Kingdom was represented by both the Minister of AgricultureFisheries and Food and the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection.Milk Products30. The Commission^ stocktaking report makes particular reference tothe serious problem of over production in the milk sector in the Community.Discussions are continuing on longer-term measures for discouraging surplusproduction. Meanwhile the Council of Ministers in July agreed on certainshort-term measures to facilitate sales of skimmed milk powder from inter-vention stocks to developing countries and on the granting of aids for privatestorage.Cereals31. The Commission^ stocktaking report refers to the need to improve the relationship between the support prices for different cereals. In july the Council of Ministers agreed on a recommendation on wheat which putsproducers and users on notice that from the 1976-77 season producers offeed wheat should not expect support at the same price levels as for wheatof bread-making quality. The Commission have been asked by the Councilto include proposals on this subject in their price proposals for 1976-77.Wine32. The Council has also been considering measures to tackle the Com-munity&apos;s surplus of wine. Discussions on longer-term measures to controlproduction have been linked with consideration of measures to deal with thesurplus which has already accumulated and with problems in trade between italy and France.(8) Cmnd. 6003, paragraph 29.
Green Pound33. The Council of Ministers in July agreed to a downward adjustment of 5 per cent in the representative rate for the   used for agricultural purposes(the green pound), and in October they agreed a further adjustment of5 - 8 per cent. As a consequence, common support prices for British farmers were raised in sterling terms by about 5 per cent and 6 per cent respectively;and the effective guaranteed price for milk was raised by 2 - 2p per gallon with effect from September with a further 2 - 3p from 1 November.New Zealand Dairy Products34. At the Council of Ministers in June, the United Kingdom called for early action to follow up the Declaration of Principle on access for NewZealand dairy products issued by Heads of Government in Dublin inMarch(3). The Commission has already produced recommendations on accessfor butter and has undertaken to make price proposals in the near future.There was a preliminary discussion at the Council of Ministers on 13-14October.Agricultural Decisions Linked to the Mediterranean Approach35. In June the Council of Ministers reached agreement on commonmeasures of protection for Community production of processed fruit and vegetables, on some further measures of support for fresh fruit and vegetablesand on stricter observance of the existing reference price system for wine.These decisions have opened the way to concluding trade agreements betweenthe Community and certain Mediterranean countries providing for a reductionin the Community tariff on their exports of agricultural produce.Fisheries36. At the Council meetings in April, the United Kingdom drew attentionto the serious short-and long-term problems facing the Community fishing industry and emphasised the particular difficulties the United kingdom industry would have in the event of changes in national fishing limits. TheCouncil agreed that the Common Fisheries Policy should be reappraised totake account of the new situation arising from likely extensions of limits. TheCommission undertook to consider what measures would be appropriate andtheir report is expected to be available shortly. During April the Communityadopted several measures to improve the stability of markets for fish.Amendments to the Directive on Health and Hygiene Requirements forPoultry Meat37. The Council of Ministers reached final agreement in June on variousamendments to this directive. The main changes of interest to the UnitedKingdom were the postponement from February 1976 to August 1981 ofthe date from which sales of uneviscerated (New York dressed) poultry wouldbe restricted to farm gate sales; and the provision of more time for adaptingpremises and introducing an inspection service to meet the directive^requirements.(9) Cmnd. 6003, paragraph 27.7162620 ,B*2
Section V.   Economic and Monetary QuestionsCommunity Budgetary Arrangements38. In July the Commission submitted to the Council of Ministers aproposal for a Regulation setting up a Budget Correcting Mechanism. Thiswas designed to implement the agreement reached between Community Headsof Government in Dublin on 10-11 March 1975 on arrangements to providea refund to any Member State if in any one year its contribution goessignificantly beyond what is fair in relation to its share of Community GNP.Discussion of the draft Regulation is expected to commence shortly withinthe Council machinery.Financial Control39. On 26 September, in a speech in Liverpool, the Prime Minister drew attention to the need to improve control over expenditure from the Com-munity Budget. After referring to the important role of the Public accounts committee and the Select Committee on Expenditure of the House ofCommons, he welcomed the fact that the European Assembly had passed aresolution to give functions similar to those of the Public Accounts Com-mittee to a Sub-Committee of the Assembly Committee on Budgets; hesuggested that the Assembly backed by a new Court of Auditors, should winfor itself a central role in monitoring expenditure over the whole range of community Policies. The Prime Minister welcomed the German proposalfor a Commissioner concerned purely with expenditure control, and suggested the designation of Accounting Officers at senior level within the Commission.Following other related suggestions, the Prime Minister said that acceptabilityof the Community Budget depended on confidence that waste or ill-consideredexpenditure is controlled, that policies are decided in relation to their expenditure implications, and that the machinery is there at Commission,Council or Assembly levels to ensure that these objectives become paramount.Financial control will be considered at the meeting of the European Councilon 1-2 December.The 1976 Budget40. The preliminary draft budget containing estimates of expenditure for 1976 was forwarded to the Council of Ministers in September by theCommission, in accordance with the standard procedures of the Communities.The total expenditure proposed amounted to 8,058 million units of account(about  3,400 million) approximately 29 per cent above the budget for 1975which, including two supplementary budgets already adopted and oneapproved by the Council but not yet finally adopted, totals 6,264 millionunits of account (about  2,600 million). Following discussion in two meetingsof the Council of Ministers on 22 and 29 September, agreement was reached on cuts totalling 584 million units of account (about  240 million).41. The budget provisionally approved for forwarding to the european assembly amounts to 7,456 million units of account (about  3,100 million);this represents an increase of about 19 per cent over the 1975 budget total.The increase is partly due to inflation and partly to the expansion of existingCommunity policies. Expenditure on the guarantee section of the European
Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund has been increased by some920 mua (about  380 million), and expenditure on the Regional development fund by 150 mua (about  60 million); provision for the European SocialFund was also increased. The Assembly will return the budget with itsobservations and proposals for consideration by the Council in November.Capital Movements42. On 23 July the United Kingdom was authorised under Article 108of the e.c. Treaty to maintain restrictions on the capital movements that were due to be liberalised under the Treaty of Accession. As a result controlsremain in force over direct investment in Member States (except Ireland) and various personal capital movements. The retention of these restrictions wasnecessitated by balance of payments considerations.Loan Facility43. A regulation adopted by the Council of Ministers on 17 February1975 empowered the Community to raise loans from third countries foron-lending to one or more Member States in balance of payments difficulties caused by the increase in prices of petroleum products. Loans will belimited to a total of $3,000 million in principal and interest and have a life of at least five years. For the United Kingdom this facility could representa useful addition to the various sources of credit that may be selected, if and when appropriate, according to the circumstances and conditions at thetime.Economic Co-operation44. At the regular meetings of the Council of Ministers on economicand monetary policy, the United Kingdom has continued to point to the needfor concerted action in the face of the deep and persistent economic recessionand resulting unemployment. On 10 July the Council of Ministers agreedupon a number of constructive suggestions, to serve as the basis for further discussion of the problems by the European Council (Heads of Government)at its meeting in Brussels on 16-17 July. Thereafter, Finance ministers decided in August to undertake a co-ordinated action to ensure support for economic activity, to continue the fight against inflation and to improvegrowth perspectives in the longer term taking into account measures already adopted by some Member States. Subsequently, additional reflationarymeasures were undertaken by those member countries whose economicsituation allowed them to do so.45. Other matters decided by the Council of Ministers included agree-ment to subscribe to the International Monetary Fund&apos;s Oil Facility interestsubsidy account for poor countries hit by the rise in oil prices.Value Added Tax46. Discussions have continued on the draft sixth directive on ValueAdded Tax. This is designed to establish a uniform structure and coveragefor the tax. It is not concerned with rates of tax. No decisions have beenreached on the final shape of the directive.
Section VI.  Regional and Industrial AffairsRegional Development Fund47. The first applications for assistance under the Fund have now beenput forward and the United Kingdom has submitted applications designedto take up an appropriate share of the Fund for 1975. Some applicationsfor assistance have been approved including applications submitted by theUnited Kingdom. These applications involve projects in all parts of theUnited Kingdom. The United Kingdom expects to benefit from commitments of  150 million over the first three years of the Fund&apos;s operation.Steel: Control of Private Investment48. The Government has been examining ways of fulfilling the objective of regaining effective control over private investment in the steel industry(10).The practices of other Member Governments are being studied. The Govern-ment will decide on the measures which would be most appropriate for theUnited Kingdom, taking account of these studies.Industrial Questions49. The Commission have submitted to the Council of Ministers a preliminary report on the aircraft construction industry following on theCouncil resolution of 4 March calling for concerted action and consultation between Member States on industrial policy in this sector. The Council ofMinisters have still to consider this Commission report.50. The Council adopted on 10 July a third directive on aids to ship-building providing inter alia for the exchange of information on aids forshipyard investment.51. The Commission^ first proposals to the Council of Ministers,following the Council resolution on data processing, for five projects in thefield of the application of data processing are now under discussion. TheCommission has recently submitted a communication to the Council whichsets out their preliminary thoughts on a medium-term programme relating toa broader strategic approach and leading to a second series of priorityprojects.State Aid52. An underlying purpose of the Community&apos;s policy on the regulationof State aids is to prevent unfair competition between Member States. TheTreaty of Rome requires that Member Governments should notify theCommission in advance of their plan to grant or alter aid to industry. TheGovernment has informed the Commission of a number of cases, including that of British Leyland.Removal of Barriers to Trade53. The Council of Ministers adopted in May two directives relating toproprietary medicinal products, as a further step towards harmonising theconditions under which the manufacture of such products is licensed in the(10) Cmnd. 6003, paragraphs 65-67.
various Member States. The Council also decided to set up a pharmaceuticalcommittee of senior Government experts from Member States to examineas necessary any questions in the field of proprietary medicinal products.Other directives adopted by the Council of Ministers were in respect oftractor equipment, aerosols and belt weighers together with a fifth amendingdirective on dangerous substances.European Investment Bank and ECSC Loans54. The European Investment Bank has since April 1975 approved loansin the United Kingdom to the value of  93-9 million. In May a loan of  12million was approved to the Distillers Company. In June one of  7 - 8 million was approved to the South of Scotland Electricity Board and one of  7-million to the National Coal Board. Two loans have been approved to theBritish Gas Corporation for North Sea gas projects, one of  24-2 million inJune and one of  23-6 million in July. Finally, in September loans were approved of  1 -6 million for Howard Glucose Company Limited of the Tateand Lyle group and  17-5 million to the Post Office for telecommunications in wales and the Marches. Both loans and grants may be made available inMember States under the financial provisions of the ECSC Treaty. Loanstotalling  94 million have been approved for the United Kingdom steelindustry since April 1975, and loans to the value of  40-5 million have beenapproved for the coal industry.Section VII.  Environment and TransportEnvironment55. The Council of Ministers adopted directives at a meeting inNovember 1974 on the quality of surface waters intended for the abstractionof drinking water and on the treatment and storage of waste oils. A recom-mendation on the application of the &quot; Polluter Pays Principle&quot; and aresolution on &quot; Energy and the Environment&quot; were also adopted. since then the Council of Ministers have adopted a directive on waste in general,(July 1975); resolutions on a list of second category pollutants to be studied(June 1975) and on Community participation in the Convention for theprevention of marine pollution from land based sources (March 1975); and adecision on a common procedure for the exchange of monitoring information on atmospheric pollution (July 1975).56. At a Council of Ministers on 16 October directives were adopted to control the sulphur content of gas oils and to set quality standards forbathing water. Agreement was also reached on decisions to allow theCommission to participate in the Barcelona Convention on Pollution in theMediterranean, and to establish a European inventory on sources of informa-tion on the environment. Ministers discussed the Commission^ preliminaryviews on a second environment programme and there was broad agreement on its general aim. The United Kingdom explained its objections to thedraft directive on dangerous substances in the aquatic environment whichincorporated proposals for uniform emission limits for a &quot;black-list&quot; ofcertain substances. There followed a discussion of the principles involved.Further consideration of this subject was proposed for a Council ofEnvironment Ministers in December.
Transport57. In December 1974 the Council of Ministers reached agreement on thesubstance of a number of proposals. A decision establishing guidelines forthe financial relations between Governments and railway undertakings inMember States was approved in principle and formerly adopted on 20 May1975. A further increase, of 20 per cent, in the Community quota for the carriage of goods by road was agreed. The Council agreed to continue the experimental bracket tariff system for road transport between Member Statesuntil the end of 1975 but in such a way as to exclude traffic with new member States including the United Kingdom from its operation. a directive to free road/rail transport from quota and permit restrictions was accepted; this has now been brought into effect from 1 October 1975 andshould help British road hauliers using the piggy-back system on theContinent.58. The Commission and other Member States were informed inSeptember of the difficulties facing the United Kingdom road transport industry over the implementation of regulations dealing with drivers&apos; hours and tachographs. The drivers&apos; hours regulation is due to apply to journeyswithin new Member States from 1 January 1976 and the tachograph regula-tion would start to apply from the same date. Following discussions with both sides of industry a deferment of application of the regulation ondrivers&apos; hours has been sought, and representations have been made to theCommission in order to find means of overcoming the difficulties posed bythe tachograph regulation. At the Council of Ministers meeting on15 October 1975 United Kingdom difficulties over drivers&apos; hours were explained to the other Member States and this subject will be discussed at alater meeting.Section VIII.  Social AffairsSocial Action Programme59. A number of further measures in the Community&apos;s Social ActionProgramme have been adopted. In December 1974 the Council of Ministersapproved directives applying the principle of equal pay for men and women and providing protection for workers in the event of collective redundancies.Proposals were also agreed on the setting up of a European Centre for vocational training and a foundation to contribute to the planning and establishment of better living and working conditions.60. In June 1975 the Council of Ministers approved a recommendation on the application of the principle of the 40 hour week and four weeksannual paid holiday to be achieved by 31 December 1978 and agreed a limitedprogramme of pilot schemes and studies to combat poverty. The UnitedKingdom have agreed to take part in this programme and a number ofpotentially suitable projects are being discussed with the Commission. Atthe same meeting agreement was reached on a new scheme under Article 4of the Social Fund to help deal with the employment problems of young workers. Allocations to the United Kingdom from the Social Fund in 1974amounted to  25-9 million; applications totalling  73-3 million have beenmade on the Fund for 1975.
Freedom of Movement61. Work has continued on the mutual recognition of qualifications andthe co-ordination of other measures to enable professional people to beemployed or to practise anywhere within the Community. The Council ofMinisters adopted in June two directives on the free movement of doctors.It also decided to set up an advisory committee on medical training and aCommittee of senior officials on public health from all Member Countries,to assist in the implementation of the directives. Similar directives relatingto other professions including nursing and architecture are under discussion.Section IX.   Education62. The Education Committee, set up by the Ministers of education of the Nine in 1974, has continued to meet and is expected to report to ministers by the end of the year.Section X.   Energy63. The Council of Ministers agreed last winter on Communityobjectives for energy production and consumption, aimed at reducingdependence on imported oil and on outline measures to achieve the objectives. At its first subsequent meeting on energy, on 26 June 1975,the Council devoted much of its discussion to Commission proposals onfinancing the development of Community energy resources. At its next meeting on energy the Council will be continuing discussions of this topicand, at the suggestion of the United Kingdom, will be taking existing national energy plans as the starting point. The United Kingdom, withthe largest indigenous energy potential of any Member State, would expect to play a major part in these discussions and any programme agreed upon.64. Meanwhile the Community is continuing to examine other aspectsof common energy policy, such as emergency arrangements, and has agreedto undertake a joint research and development programme.Consumer/Producer Dialogue65. In April the Community took an active part in the meeting inParis of the ten-member preparatory group for the consumer/producerdialogue in which it was represented by the Commission and the IrishPresidency. This meeting failed to reach agreement on the agenda for an expanded Conference to be held at Ministerial level.66. Following extensive informal soundings a further meeting of thepreparatory group was held in Paris from 13-16 October. This meetingreached agreement on arrangements for a 27-member conference on inter-national economic co-operation to be held in Paris from 16 December.The Conference will establish four commissions to cover energy and rawmaterials, development and related financial questions. The United kingdom has been playing an active role in the continuing discussions in the Com-munity to establish an agreed policy on substantive issues in the dialogue.The United Kingdom has in addition claimed separate representation atthe Conference.
Section XI.   Institutional Matters67. The meeting of Heads of Government in Paris on 9-10 December1974 took a number of decisions in the institutional field.The European Council68. The Heads of Government decided that in future they would holdregular meetings at least three times a year. These meetings, of which thefirst was held in Dublin on 10-11 March and the second in Brussels on16-17 July, have already provided a valuable forum for consultation between Heads of Government and enable them to give broad politicaldirection to the activities of the Nine, both in the Community frameworkand in that of political co-operation. The next meeting of the EuropeanCouncil, as these meetings are now called, will take place in Rome on1-2 December under Italian Presidency.Mr. Tindemans&apos; Mission69. At their Paris meeting, the Heads of Government invitedMr. Tindemans, the Belgian Prime Minister, to prepare a report designedto clarify the concept of European Union. During 1975 Mr. Tindemanshas had consultations in e.c. capitals with Governments, parliamentariansand other representatives of public opinion. He has also received reports fromthe Commission and the European Assembly. Mr. Tindemans visitedLondon, Edinburgh and Cardiff from 29 June to 2 July. During the visit Ministers explained to him the views of the Government as set outin the report on renegotiation(11). They made it clear that they welcomed the opportunity to discuss with him without commitment ways in whichthe Communities might develop. The Government will examine carefullyany proposals in Mr. Tindemans&apos; report, which is expected to be completedtowards the end of the year.Direct Elections70. At the Paris Heads of Government Meeting in December 1974there was support for the view that elections to the European Assemblyby direct universal suffrage, one of the objectives laid down in the EECTreaty, should be achieved as soon as possible. The Prime Minister made it clear that the United Kingdom could not take up a position on thisproposal before the process of renegotiation had been completed and theresults of renegotiation submitted to the people. Subsequently, the EuropeanCouncil at its meeting on 16-17 July invited the Council of Ministers toexamine the problem, taking into account the draft Convention submittedby the European Assembly itself and any factors which might emergeduring the examination and to report back to it by the end of the year.A Council working group was set up to explore the implications of thisquestion. As the report on renegotiation(12) made clear, any scheme for direct elections to the European Assembly would require an Act ofParliament in the United Kingdom.(&quot;) Cmnd. 6003, paragraph 130.(12) Cmnd. 6003.
Passport Union71. At their meeting in Paris in December 1974, Heads of government also agreed on the setting up of a working party to study the possibilityof establishing a passport union, and in anticipation of this, the introduc-tion of a uniform passport. At its July meeting the European Councilinvited the Council of Ministers to ensure that further progress is madeon the setting up of a passport union and to submit a report on thisquestion, if possible by the end of the year. A Council working group hasbeen set up to consider this question.Budgetary Powers of the European Assembly72. A Treaty providing for certain changes in the procedures for establishing the Community Budget and also setting up a CommunityAudit Court was signed by a Conference of Representatives of the Govern-ments of the Member States in Brussels on 22 July 1975. The Treatyhas now been transmitted to Member Governments for ratification inaccordance with their respective constitutional procedures. This Treatygives legal form to certain of the measures provisionally agreed upon bythe Council of Ministers in June 1974. The other element in those measures,the establishment of a procedure whereby differences of view between theCouncil and the Assembly over policy matters with important financial implications can be discussed and reconciled, was introduced in March 1975.European Court of Justice73. On 4 December 1974 the European Court of Justice gave its rulingin the case of Van Duyn v. the Home Office, the first case referred to it by any Court in the United Kingdom. On the substance of the case theEuropean Courfs ruling upheld the view advanced by the Governmentthat there was no Community obligation on the British Government to admit to this country a Community national who wished to take up employ-ment in the United Kingdom with an organisation whose activities were considered contrary to the public good. The ruling has, however, attractedattention in legal circles because it marked a limited extension of thecircumstances in which particular provisions of a Community directivemight be held to be directly applicable in the Member States. This point was debated in the House of Lords on 15 April 1975. During the period under review, the Government have submitted observations to the EuropeanCourt in a number of other cases which involved United Kingdom interests.Section XII.  Parliament and the European Communities74. Proposals for secondary legislation by the Council of Ministers andother documents published by the Commission for submission to the council have continued to be deposited in Parliament. From 21 March 1975 (thelast date up to which figures were given in Cmnd. 6003) to 31 October 1975the House of Commons Scrutiny Committee considered and reported on 346Community documents and the House of Lords Committee on 289. Of these the House of Commons Committee identified 14 documents as raising issues
of sufficient importance to warrant their being debated by the House and the lords Committee correspondingly identified 19 documents. Over the sameperiod a total of 20 documents were debated by the Commons and 12 bythe Lords.75. The House of Commons Scrutiny Committee published on 27 August1975 its Third Special Report of the 1974-75 Session on the difficulties experienced in connection with the examination of the preliminary draftCommunity Budget for 1976. The Government brought this report to theattention of the Council of Ministers at the meeting on 22 September. TheHouse of Lords Committee also published on 18 July 1975 a Special Report,its second of the Session, on the scope and working of the Committee after a year&apos;s experience.  This report was debated in the House on 22 July.76. The Select Committee on Procedure of the House of Commonspublished their First Report on European Secondary Legislation on 25 April1975. The Select Committee&apos;s principal recommendations concern the estab-lishment of a new Standing Committee procedure for the debate of community documents recommended by the Scrutiny Committee or given notice of by individual Members.77. There have been regular monthly Ministerial statements on business in the Council of Ministers for the following month to accompany the writtenforecast deposited in the House and on two occasions Ministerial statementshave been made on the outcome of meetings of the Council of Ministers.Further information on Council decisions and other Community matters hasbeen given in answer to Parliamentary Questions.31 October 1975
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME MINISTER TO THEHOUSE OF COMMONS ON 9 JUNE 1975With permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to make a statement.As the House knows, last Thursday the British people voted to stay in theEuropean Community.What has impressed all of us, and no less our friends in Europe, theCommonwealth and more widely, has been not only the high turn-out andthe clear and unmistakable nature of the decision, but also the consistentpattern of positive voting over almost every county and region of the UnitedKingdom.It is now almost 14 years since the British Government first applied inJuly 1961 for negotiations to join the Community.The issue of membership has cut across party lines, and the government recognise the deep sincerity with which views have been held on both sides.The debate is now over. The two tests set out in our manifesto of successfulrenegotiation and the expressed approval of the majority of the british people have been met. The historic decision has been made. I hope thatthis House and the country as a whole will follow the lead which theGovernment intend to give in placing past divisions behind us, and in workingtogether to play a full and constructive part in all Community policies and activities.I am well aware that the period of renegotiation and the Referendum hasbeen difficult for other members of the Community. I pay tribute again tothe constructive spirit in which they have dealt with our renegotiation pro-posals. In his statement to the Council of Ministers in Luxembourg on1 April last year, at the outset of renegotiation, my right honourable friend the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, if we were successful,there would be a firm basis for continuing British membership of astrengthened Community.I now say to our partners in the Community that we look forward to continuing to work with them in promoting the Community&apos;s wider interestsand in fostering a greater sense of purpose among the Member States.I would also wish to say to our friends and allies in the Commonwealthwho made clear their hope that we would remain within the Community and to all the developing countries that we shall hope to bring even more to our relationship with them following the clear decision of the Britishelectorate last Thursday.I have already made clear the Governments general approach to Com-munity policies. But it also follows from the decision to remain in theCommunity that this country should be fully represented in all theCommunity&apos;s institutions. I have said that if renegotiation succeeded and if our recommendation was endorsed by the country we should feel it right thatthis House should be fully represented in the European Assembly. a recommendation to this end will now be made to the Parliamentary LabourParty.
The House will have noted the statements by the General Secretary of the tuc and the Chairman of the TUC International Committee making clearthat the TUC is now likely to enter fully into the work of the Economicand Social Committee of the e.c. and to work with the European IndustrialLabour Movement in a way which can only mean strengthening the tradeunion movement throughout the Community and here in Britain.What we can achieve in our attack on both the economic problems we faceat home and wider world economic problems depends basically on the efforts which we ourselves make. But, with the uncertainty over our membership of the European Community at an end, we can continue our efforts with greater confidence to find solutions to the great problems, both domestic and international, which confront us.The decision will also, I am sure, give confidence to those overseas whohave been considering plans for investment in Britain. There are signs thatthis is already happening.The improvement of our own economic situation and our contributionto a more equitable world economic order can best be made from a settledposition within the Community. We now have that settled position, andwe are determined to make a success of it. But our future will continue to depend on what we are prepared to do by our own efforts, our skill, ourtechnology and our restraint, a restraint which demonstrates our concern for the interests of those members of our national community least able tohelp themselves.
STATEMENT BY THE RIGHT HON. JAMES CALLAGHAN, M.P.,SECRETARY OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs, AT THE MEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS(FOREIGN AFFAIRS) AT LUXEMBOURG ON 24 JUNE 1975I would like to express my thanks on behalf of the British Governmentfor the way in which all my colleagues around the table and the member states accepted the propositions that I put forward in this room just over ayear ago; and with good humour and understanding examined them. I placeon record both my Governmenfs thanks and my personal thanks to the member States and to all who contributed to the solution of all our problems.Secondly, you may have seen that the Referendum resulted in a decisivevote. It is a vote that has been accepted by all the people of the UnitedKingdom whether they were originally pro or anti and our legislators have accepted it. Last night for example I attended a meeting of a large group ofthe Parliamentary Labour Party where there were both pro and anti-Marketeers present. The anti-Marketeers were quite clear that they acceptedthe verdict of the British people in these matters and that they would worknow to make a success of the enterprise they were engaged in.But there is no doubt of what I said on 4 June last: that a successful outcome would provide a basis for continuing British membership of astrengthened Community. It was particularly gratifying for us that all partsof the United Kingdom, that is England, Wales, Scotland and NorthernIreland with the small exception of the outlying islands, gave a resoundingaffirmation of their support for British membership of the Community andwe can now regard this issue as settled.We can look forward with some confidence; and our concern will be tomake the Community work more effectively for the benefit of all its members and of its peoples. There is a great deal of work for us to do as we have seentoday. But it is my hope and my intention, as far as I have responsibility in this matter, that we shall increasingly see the Nine countries acting as one in their relations with the outside world.We have succeeded in doing this in our efforts to promote detente throughthe CSCE. We have made a good beginning in the preparation for the Euro /Arab dialogue. We must, in the period immediately ahead, concentrate on reaching common positions on relations between developed and developing countries in order to move the world away from confrontation towardsconstructive dialogue.The Community also has a major role to play in the preparation for the seventh Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly in September.One major aspect of this is the current dialogue about commodities and rawmaterials. We want to build a new basis for co-operation between the developed and the developing world. The discussion is continuing in theCommonwealth context. But I have studied with very great care and interest the Commission^ paper on this subject and we are convinced that an indispensable element in making progress must be agreement on a Community
policy and I hope that the Council will be able to make substantial progress towards that agreement. We would endeavour to dovetail with theCommonwealth approach. There is another important and related fieldwhereby acting together we can promote our common interests in relationsbetween producers and consumers of energy. In considering relationsbetween developed and developing countries, we must also keep in mind theimportance of giving effect to our decisions on aid to non-associated states. Afurther area in which the Community could work together is that of social policy.Within the Community we shall be seeking more effective consultation and co-ordination in matters of economic policy in order to reduce the impact of the current recession and to pave the way for the renewed expansion ofeconomic activity. We shall be looking for progressive improvement of theCommon Agricultural Policy in line with the proposals which have alreadybeen made during the current stocktaking. Such changes which can reducethe cost to the Community and to consumers will be of benefit to all of the member States. Now I acknowledge that in referring to these economic and agricultural questions, I am trespassing on fields which are normally dealt withby economic and agricultural colleagues, but in this Council we should maintain a broad oversight of all the activities of the Community.Then there is the question of the development of Community institutions.I am very glad to confirm to you that the British Labour Party will shortly besending representatives to the European Assembly and they will play their full part in that body. I have had conversations with the trade unions and I hopeand believe that following our conversations the British trade unions willbefore long take up their places in the Economic and Social Committee andin other organisations of the Community. They have not yet taken decisionsbut I understand that the minds of the leaders are moving in that direction.We must have assent if we are to make progress. There are questions inthis whole field, for example the proposals which the Assembly has made for direct elections. I have asked that these should be studied. There aredifficulties for us as for others. I cannot promise we shall be able to putforward an answer in July. Matters are complicated by devolution of powersto Scotland and to Wales and I cannot promise that we will have an earlyreply but I do not intend to hold this up. We will try to be ready in theautumn. I hope you will consider this is reasonable in view of the complexissues involved.We are looking forward with pleasure to the visit of Mr. Tindemans toLondon next week. We shall await with great interest the report that he isdue to present at the end of the year. I have asked him if he has time to notonly talk to members of the Government but talk to many other people in britain. The minority felt passionately about sovereignty and other problems and in drawing up his report he ought to have regard to that section ofopinion.All these Community institution questions we will examine with good faith, with genuine desire to promote practical proposals for strengthening the Community. We shall consider practical proposals against the background of our own people and our own people&apos;s aspirations. That does not mean that
we shall, fail to look after our own interests or to defend our point of viewany more than other members. My colleagues will know that there are someoutstanding issues of concern to us, for instance on the import of NewZealand dairy produce, the question of steel and so on. We shall pursue thesequestions and try to arrive at constructive solutions.1 would like to say that my experience of this Council has confirmedmy conviction that the best road towards closer partnership among all of us who are Member States is that we tackle the real problems of the world in common. That is the main thing that our work together is about.We have established a system of Heads of Government meetings three times a year in the European Council. We have overcome the difficultiespreviously experienced in running the Council and the political co-operationmachinery in harmony. We have set up the Regional Development Fund.We have made progress with the budgetary powers of the European assembly and set up the conciliation procedure between the Council and the Assembly.In our relations with other countries and groups of countries we haveeven more significant achievements to our credit. There is no doubt in my mind that the Community has become a powerful pole of attraction to othercountries and I look to it becoming even more a force for peace and progressin the world.We shall seize any opportunities which present themselves, taking accountof what is and what is not politically and economically possible foreach of us, to approach greater unity of thought and policy in all spheresamong our countries.Mr. President, the British aim is to strengthen the Community and to use it as an instrument for good for Member States and the world. You can count on the United Kingdom to do our best to find ways of makingcontributions towards that end.
