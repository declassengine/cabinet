DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 144 gjCOPY NO10 December 1 975CABINETCHRYSLERMemorandum by the Secretary of State for industry. The position we have reached in our discussion with the chrysler corporation about continued operation by Chrysler UK is set out in the annex to this paper.i.       The total commitment of Her Majesty&apos;s Government,under the Chrysler Corporation^ present proposal, couldamount to  184j million up to 1979, without any effectivecontrols by us.    Hopefully, a part of this, for example theguarantee of the Finance for Industry (FFI) loan, would notarise and the Chrysler Corporation would provide a part ofthe capital finance required.ii.       We are doing this in the interests of 17, 000 jobs in the motor industry in Scotland and the Midlands and a further,unquantified, number of jobs among suppliers and distributors.We are also able to continue supplying Iran, to the benefit ofthe balance of payments.iii.       We already have the view of the Industrial DevelopmentAdvisory Board that the original  55 million development plan was not viable and they are now considering the new proposition.There is no provision for a programme of capital developmentbeyond 1979 and no prospect of adequate profits beinggenerated to finance such a programme.if.       In return for a subvention of their losses up to the limitsagreed they have undertaken to contribute between  10 and 12 million in the first year to the cost of the  35 milliondevelopment at Ryton, a guarantee of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentscover for the FFI loan, and a share of possible losses in 1976-79.They have not yet agreed to contribute anything, by way of cash oarguarantee, to the  55 million development plan, although we are pressing them to do so.1
v.       A straightforward subvention to losses will create a precedent which we will be pressed to follow in other cases(for example shipbuilding companies),vi.       In the interests of employment, of the balance ofpayments and of industrial growth we need a strong, v.l?.blemotor industry in this country.vii.       We are alraady committed to publishing the central policy Review Staff Report on the industry, and will have to reconcile our decision with the conclusions of that Report.2. The social arguments in favour of reaching agreement withChrysler are of course strong.    On the other hand there are industrialarguments relevant to risking Government money on this scale in supportof a company which is waak both in the United Kingdom and in the UnitedStates.3, If my colleagues conclude that we should support Chrysler Ibelieve that this should only be on the clear understanding that theycontribute substantially to the capital cost of the  55 million development programme and should give adequate assurances about continuedoperation in the United Kingdom firmly linked to their worldwide organisa-tion.    We should then use our best endeavours to make such an arrangementwork, despite the unpromising prospect.E V Department of Industry10 December 1975
ANNEXPRESENT STATE 0? NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE CHRYSLER CORPORATIONFollowing Cabinet consideration last Thurndny (CC (75) 53rdmeeting conclusions minute 2) and subsequent discussion inthe Ministerial Group on the Automobile Industry (MISC 59 (75)10th &amp; 11th meetings) the Ministerial negotiating team put thefollowing proposition to the CC team :(a) HMG would accept in full the first  40m of losses by Chrysler UK (CUK) in 1976 and half any additionallosses from 1976 - 1979 inclusive up to  20m in 1976, 20m in 1977,  15m in 1978 and  10m in 1979.    TotalIcommitment under this heading would thus be  72-g-m.for these four years. !(b) HMG would also be willing to guarantee if necessary a Chrysler Corporation obligation to Finance for industry of  35m provided this sum were counter-guaranteed by Chryslers themselves.(c) We had. no authority, to offer any finance towards the 55m required for new model and capital developmentbut HMG would be prepared to consider this in slowerSECRET ^
-2-SECRETtime in the context of full discussions with CC about their proposals for new models integration of CUKwith their world-wide activities etc.In response the CC team accepted the offers under (a) and (b);and in discussion of (c) said that in addition to the physical plans which we have been considering under the title of Scheme Bthey now envisaged the possibility of a further development programme to keep Ryton in operation after the assembly ofAvengers has been moved to Linwood by starting production therenext Summer of their C6 model (the French Alpine imported.from Simca in knocked down form); capital cost would be about  35&amp;.Over the next 15 months the UK sourcedcontent would be increased to 57%;the capital cost of this partof 1heoperation would be  10 - 12m which would be met by CC.   Theposition would then be reviewed in a year&apos;s time to settlewhether to go for 100% UK sources over the following 18 monthsat a cost of a further  22m.    In this way they would provideinitially an extra 1500 jobs rising to 2000 over 15 months -making a total of about 17000 for CUK - and also make much easier the handling of relations with the work force overthe move of the plant from the Midlands to Linwood.When Ministers considered the outcome of these discussions afterthe departure of the CC team their preliminary view was thatwith the additional model development at Ryton the proposals made more industrial and social sense.   However they were not satisfied
that the &quot;balance of financial risk had been fairly struck ifdevelopment funds would have to be provided by HMG and a cablewas subsequently sent to CC in Detroit for their Board meeting this Wednesday, 10th December, proposing that they should provide a guarantee for the first two tranches of the  55m capital development funds required under Scheme B - amounting to  28mover 1976/77; or alternatively they should provide thesefunds direct.   Their reply will be reported to cabinet as soon as it is received.Immediate discussions have been started x^ith CUK about thedetails of their now extended plan and Coopers and Lybrandshave been invited to report on its accounting aspects.   TheScheme is being considered immediately by the IndustrialDevelopment Advisory Board whose views will be reported to cabinet.The Department of Industry also is engaging Rothschilds toadvise on the terms under which HMG should participate inthis Scheme.
