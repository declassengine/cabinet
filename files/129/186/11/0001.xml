PART I:   introduction. The fact that our democratic institutions have been admirablystable over a long period does not mean that they are perfect. A healthydemocracy must develop and adapt itself to changing circumstances. Theactivities of central government now include substantial powers and functions that could be exercised at a level closer to the people. The case for this is especially strong in Scotland and Wales, where there is a keen sense of being Scottish or Welsh as well as British. This was the main reason forthe decision announced by the Government in a White Paper* in September1974 to set up in Scotland and Wales elected assemblies with wideresponsibilities.2. The 1974 decision was taken after extensive public discussion on a consultative document, and clearly met the aspirations of the majority ofthe Scots and the Welsh. That decision was however only the beginning.The constitutional changes proposed are the most fundamental of theirkind in Great Britain for centuries, and raise complex and far-reachingproblems. There are few parallels anywhere for dividing between two levels of government the powers and functions long exercised centrally in a unitary state. The new system must work efficiently as well as democratically,and it must stand the test of time.3. The White Paper of September 1974 indicated in broad terms theroles and powers of the Assemblies and the subject areas in which theywould operate. This White Paper turns those general principles of devolutioninto detailed proposals. It explains how the new institutions would work,what subject areas would be devolved, how continuing United kingdom interests would be looked after, and how the financial principles outlined in the earlier White Paper would be implemented. The proposals rest onwide-ranging and intensive studies. The activities of every GovernmentDepartment have been examined in detail to establish how devolutionshould affect them. The difficult economic problems relating to expenditure and taxation by devolved administrations have been thoroughly examined.The elements interact in complex ways, and great care has therefore been necessary to ensure that the final proposals form a consistent package.4. In the Governments view the proposals set out in this White Paperare coherent and workable, and provide a sound basis for legislation. Theyenvisage a massive handover to the new elected Assemblies of responsibilityfor the domestic affairs of Scotland and Wales, within the firm continuingframework of the United Kingdom. They will give closer democratic control* Democracy and Devolution: Proposals for Scotland and Wales (Cmnd 5732).1
and will help to foster the distinctive national traditions of Scotland andWales, which are widely valued throughout the United Kingdom as part ofour common heritage. They will give new scope for meeting the particularneeds and desires of the people of Scotland and Wales. The United kingdom has never been a monolithic state, and this fresh recognition of our diversitywithin it can reinforce our fundamental unity.5. The Government recognise however that these proposals concern the whole of the United Kingdom. Two issues are of particular importance achieving a sound and stable distribution of responsibilities betweenWestminster and the devolved administrations; and ensuring that theproposals meet the reasonable needs of Scotland and Wales, while main-taining a fair balance between their interests and those of the rest of theUnited Kingdom. The Government now want to see full public and parliamentary consideration of the proposals. The issues are extremely important for all the people of the United Kingdom; the arrangements proposed are novel; and in constitutional matters, where frequent change would be harmful, there is a need for the widest possible basis of agreement on the essential features before legislation is enacted which will inevitably be very complicated. The main structure of the schemes is clear, but they need not represent the last word in every respect. The Government will therefore be very willing to listen to representations about their proposals that are consistent with the basic approach set out in Part II of this white paper.6. Work is in hand on drafting a Bill, which will take accountprogressively of points made during consultation. It will be published inthe spring of 1976. It would not however be feasible then to carry so majora Bill through to Royal Assent in the 1975/76 session. Moreover, theGovernment believe that it would be wrong to legislate in haste on issuesbe very complicated. The main structure of the schemes is clear, but theypublished, will provide the opportunity for debate and for focussing opinionmore closely on specific legislative proposals; and the Government will take account of all this in further refining the schemes. They will then introduce a Bill in Parliament at the start of the following session.7. The unity of the United Kingdom does not mean uniform treatment for all its parts. This White Paper is about devolution to Scotland andWales, and its proposals are related to their circumstances. As the white paper of September 1974 made clear, Northern Ireland is in a different category. Its history and geography distinguish it from other parts of theUnited Kingdom, as does the presence of two separate communities. Itsproblems are not those of Scotland or Wales, and therefore do notnecessarily require the same treatment. England is different again, and theGovernment will publish separately a document to provide a basis fordiscussion of possible future arrangements in England.8. Part II of this White Paper outlines the Government^ general approach to devolution. Part III sets out the scheme for Scotland and part iv the scheme for Wales; to make each reasonably self-contained, there is
inevitably a good deal of repetition between them. Part V reviews thedecentralised responsibilities of Scottish and Welsh Ministers in the UnitedKingdom Government the Secretary of State for Scotland and the lord advocate, and the Secretary of State for Wales. Part VI deals with the costof implementing devolution in Scotland and Wales. Part VII summarises the implications which the proposals for Scotland and Wales will have for theUnited Kingdom as a whole.
PART II:  THE GOVERNMENTS APPROACH9. Political and economic unity has been maintained and deepenedthroughout Great Britain for over two and a half centuries, giving itscountries a common history, heritage and way of life richer than any of them could have enjoyed on its own.10. The Government are firmly committed to maintaining this unity.It is a powerful and constructive force shaping the daily lives of us all;and those who advocate destroying the United Kingdom, for the sake of a real or imaginary short-term gain to some, brush aside the long-term loss to all. The Government reject entirely the idea of separation for Scotlandand Wales and the break-up of the United Kingdom, and believe that thevast majority of Scottish and Welsh people endorse this rejection. As theGovernment made clear in the White Paper of September 1974, they agreewholeheartedly with the Kilbrandon Commission* in rejecting alsofederalism within the United Kingdom.11. Unity however is not uniformity. Within the United KingdomScotland and Wales have kept their own identities, with distinctive elements of tradition, culture and institutions. Respect for these diversities hasstrengthened the Union far more than an imposed conformity could havedone.12. This respect underlies the long tradition of decentralisation of scottish government that is, the practice whereby large areas of govern-ment work for Scotland are carried out not in London but in Edinburgh,under Ministers answerable to Parliament at Westminster but neverthelessdistinctively Scottish. In 1964 the Government extended this system to wales; and its scope in both countries has recently been widened by thetransfer of new responsibilities in the industrial field to the two secretaries of State.13. Decentralisation remains a useful means of ensuring that adminis-tration in Scotland and Wales is founded on an understanding of the needs and wishes of these countries; the Government will continue to use it and indeed in some respects to extend it, as Part V explains.14. The Government believe however that something more is needed the creation of elected as well as administrative institutions distinctive to scotland and Wales. This is what devolution means. There will be newdemocratic bodies, directly chosen by and answerable to the Scottish and welsh people for very wide fields of government.*Royal Commission on the Constitution 1969-73; Cmnd 5460 and 5460-1.4
15. The central task on which the Government have concentrated in developing the devolution schemes is to define those areas of activity wheredecisions affect primarily people living in Scotland and Wales. It wouldplainly be wrong to devolve to the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies powers over activities which substantially affect people elsewhere, or the well-being of the United Kingdom generally. The need is to achieve balance-to reconcile unity and diversity in a stronger and better system, offering moreachievement and satisfaction to the parts while improving the efficiency and stability of the whole. In working this out the Government have observedthe principles which flow from acceptance of the essential unity of theUnited Kingdom. They have also kept in mind the need for a consistentand coherent pattern of government, which will be clear and understandableto the people who work in it and the public whom they serve. The objectivethroughout has been the long-term advantage of the people of Scotlandand Wales within the United Kingdom.16. Under the Governments proposals, the Assemblies will controlpolicies and spending priorities over a very wide field, including for examplemost aspects of local government, health, personal social services, education,housing, physical planning, the environment and roads, and many aspects oftransport. They will have a very large block grant from the Exchequer andsome power to supplement it from local taxation, and they will have thefullest possible freedom to decide how the money should be spent amongthe services they control. The Scottish Assembly will also be able to makenew laws or amend present ones in these matters, and it will be responsiblefor most aspects of the distinctive private and criminal law of Scotland.17. All these powers will enable the new Scottish and Welsh adminis-trations to bring far-reaching influence to bear on the whole physical and social environment of their countries. That influence, together with the hugespending power* which they will control, will enable them to have a very marked effect also on their economic environment.18. The new powers will not however be conferred at the expense of thebenefits which flow from the political and economic unity of the UnitedKingdom.19. Political unity means that The Queen in Parliament, representingall the people, must remain sovereign over their affairs; and that theGovernment of the day must bear the main responsibility to parliament for protecting and furthering the interests of all. In particular, the Govern-ment must be able to do whatever is needed for national security; they mustconduct international relations, including those flowing from our membership of the European Community; and they must maintain the national frame-work of law and order, guaranteeing the basic rights of the citizenthroughout the United Kingdom.* In 1974-75 public expenditure on the services proposed for devolution was about 2,000 million in Scotland and  850 million in Wales.
20. Economic unity plainly means that the Government must managethe nation&apos;s external economic relations-the balance of payments, theexchange rate, external assets and liabilities, and economic, trading andother arrangements with other countries. But the principle reaches much further. The Government must be able to manage demand in the economy as a whole-to control national taxation, total public expenditure and thesupply of money and credit. The Government must be able to regulate the framework of trade, so as to maintain a fair competitive balance for industry and commerce everywhere. Within the wider common market whichthe European Community is developing we already enjoy a common marketthroughout the United Kingdom, and any new and artificial barriers within that long-established market could be seriously damaging. And the Govern-ment must also keep the task of devising national policies to benefitparticular parts of the United Kingdom, and of distributing resources among them according to relative need. This last point is the cardinal fact about our whole system of allocating public expenditure. Resources are distributednot according to where they come from but according to where they are needed. This applies between geographical areas just as much as between individuals.21. People are less and less ready to tolerate extremes of wealth andpoverty alongside one another in our society. Unplanned economic forces,changes in world demand and the discovery of new natural resources can bring fortune or misfortune to large areas, and over the centuries almost every part of the United Kingdom has experienced this ebb and flow. Inrecent times successive Governments have increasingly sought to reduceinequalities; the fact that Scotland and Wales are at present classified in their entirety as assisted areas is evidence of this. So, too, is the fact that undersuccessive Governments Scotland and Wales have continued to benefit fromlevels of public expenditure per head significantly higher than the UnitedKingdom average. If these had been financed entirely by Scotland andWales, their taxpayers would have had to pay much more.22. Regional policies have been formulated and implemented for GreatBritain as a whole, so that priorities can be judged and the resources of thewhole country deployed to help solve problems as they arise anywhere within it. Relative need can be assessed only by taking an overall view, and this must be the responsibility of the Government. It would not be practicableeven to leave particular areas to draw up their own schemes of economicsupport and assistance within an overall allocation, since divergences could easily distort competition in ways incompatible with a unified economy.23. The Assemblies will have great economic influence, as paragraphs16-17 above have explained. The Scottish administration will control the highlands and Islands Development Board*. In addition, the arrangementsfor the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies described in paragraphs138 and 251 will give the Assemblies an important role in relation to the
work of these new bodies, which are intended to give a fresh stimulus to industrial and environmental regeneration. At the same time the transfer of manpower functions crucial to economic development to the secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales (paragraph 282) will add an important new dimension to the decision making in the economic field carried out inScotland and Wales.24. The complete schemes for Scotland and Wales are set out in PartsIII and IV respectively. They are designed to give wide freedom to the newadministrations in domestic matters whilst protecting the United Kingdominterest. But the Government do not envisage that after the new system is set up they and the administrations will deal with one another at arm&apos;slength. Every effort will be made in advance to cut out overlap and uncertainty, and to avoid the problems which ill-defined relationships would cause; but there will be many matters on which continuing close contactswill be in the common interest.25. Arrangements will be needed for extensive but flexible consultation on many subjects and at all levels, political and official. Through these theGovernment and the devolved administrations will keep one anotherinformed and will work together as closely as possible. Interests willsometimes differ, and give and take will be needed. But the Government see no reason to fear that the longstanding spirit of partnership within theUnited Kingdom will be lost; indeed, they believe that it will be enhanced.They look forward to working out effective two-way consultation arrange-ments with the devolved administrations as soon as possible, and to operatingthem constructively over the years.26. At the same time the Government cannot shed their responsibilityfor the interests of the United Kingdom as a whole. They must ensure thatthey and their successors remain able to act freely and promptly in those interests. Reserve powers are therefore built into the devolution proposals to enable the Government of the day to intervene, subject to the approvalof Parliament, in actions by the devolved administrations which theGovernment judge seriously harmful.27. It is impossible to predict what situations might lead to the useof these powers, and it is largely for this reason that the Government proposeto provide them rather than attempt to deal specifically in the Act with every possible eventuality. Their use should not therefore be regarded as a last resort implying a serious confrontation. But if the schemes of devolution fulfil their objectives, the necessity to use reserve powers shouldnot arise frequently and need not be a source of conflict. The future of us allturns to a great extent upon harmonious co-operation between all the peopleof the United Kingdom and their elected representatives, whether in Parlia-ment or in the Assemblies.
PART III: Scotland a.  THE BACKGROUND TO DEVOLUTION28. Ever since the voluntary union of Scotland and England in 1707the arrangements for the government of Scotland have differed in some respects from those for England. In modern times these arrangements havecentred on the office of the Secretary of State for Scotland. A Secretaryfor Scotland was created in 1885, but the present system dates effectivelyfrom the opening in 1939 of St Andrew&apos;s House in Edinburgh. It gives tothe Secretary of State, who is a member of the Cabinet, a wide range of responsibilities for the administration of government in Scotland. these include most of the functions that in England are the responsibility of theHome Office, the Department of Education and Science, the Departmentof the Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food andthe health and personal social service sides of the Department of health and Social Security, as well as (more recently) some functions of the Depart-ment of Industry. In addition, the Lord Advocate as a Scottish minister has always had wide functions in the field of law.29. This system gives Scotland a strong voice in the Cabinet and separate representation on interdepartmental committees where policy options are worked out. The Government intend that there should remainmajor roles for the Secretary of State and the Lord Advocate, as Part Vof this White Paper shows. But the present system, based on Westminsterwith its wider burdens, cannot always be responsive enough to distinctivelyScottish problems and characteristics. Factors like these have become more significant as the scope of government work and the calls on Parlia-menfs time have grown.30. The best way of improving matters in the particular circumstancesof Scotland is by legislative and executive devolution. This means an electedScottish Assembly which can determine its own priorities, pass its own laws and oversee the work of government. Scottish institutions and practiceswill be largely in the care of a purely Scottish body directly answerable to the Scottish people. It will be able, for example, to find more time thanWestminister now can for Scottish legislation tailored to fit the distinctivelaw of Scotland and the separate legal system.B.  CONSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS31. Many features of the constitutional scheme proposed are modelledon Parliament, where they are well tried and have evolved over the centuriesin a practical blend of efficient government and democratic rights. Parlia-ment must endow Scotland with a comparable blend. But the Government
do not intend that the new Assembly should be forced to be a carboncopy of Westminster. Within the main features which the Act must lay down and which only Parliament can change, the Scottish Assembly andthe Executive answerable to it will be free to develop their own ways ofworking as they judge best.The Scottish Assembly32. There will be a single-chamber Scottish Assembly, initially with142 members two for each of the 71 Parliamentary constituencies inScotland. There will not be time before the Assembly comes into being forthe Boundary Commission for Scotland to complete the thorough scrutinyneeded to divide the Parliamentary constituencies fairly. At the first electiontherefore each elector will be able to vote for two candidates, and in eachParliamentary constituency the two with most votes will become AssemblyMembers.33. For later elections the Boundary Commission will divide Parlia-mentary constituencies as necessary into single-member Assemblyconstituencies, on a basis which will improve the fairness of the system by taking more account of the number of voters in each constituency. EachParliamentary constituency will be allotted one, two or three Assemblyseats, according to a formula based on the average size of Parliamentaryelectorates in Scotland. The formula will be this:  a. Parliamentary constituency whose electorate is   1 Assemblyless than 75% of the average electorate constituencyb. Parliamentary constituency whose electorate is   2 Assemblynot less than 75% and not more than 125% of   constituenciesthe average electoratec. Parliamentary constituency whose electorate is   3 Assemblymore than 125% of the average electorate constituenciesOn present electorates, this system would give an Assembly of about 138members. The formula will be re-applied, and any necessary re-divisionmade, whenever Parliamentary seats are redistributed. The divisions intoAssembly constituencies will be embodied in draft Orders in Council laidbefore Parliament by the Secretary of State.34. Everyone entitled to vote in Parliamentary elections, and alsopeers, will be able to vote in Assembly elections; but no one will have a vote in more than one constituency. The Secretary of State will beresponsible for general oversight of Assembly elections and for makingrules for them on election expenses and the like.35. The Assembly will be elected for a normal fixed term of fouryears, but the Secretary of State will have power to make minor adjust-ments either way to give a convenient election day.
36. The time, place and other arrangements for the first meeting willbe set by the Secretary of State. Thereafter these matters will be for theAssembly itself to decide.37. Matters affecting Assembly membership, such as the rules aboutqualification, disqualification, expulsion and resignation, will be dealt within the Act, as will the special safeguards which members will need to do their job effectively, such as protection against actions for defamation.Membership of the Assembly will not be barred to Members of the Houseof Commons or the House of Lords. Practical considerations will oftenprevent them from standing for election to the Assembly, but it does not seem right that they should be excluded by statute. Qualification and dis-qualification are dealt with in more detail in Appendix A.38. Every candidate elected to the Assembly will have to swear oraffirm allegiance to the Crown before taking his seat.39. The pay and allowances of Assembly Members will be determinedinitially by the Secretary of State, and thereafter by the Assembly itself.40. The Secretary of State will make interim Standing Orders to getthe Assembly started, but thereafter it will make its own, subject to anyrequirements in the Act for example on the use of committees (paragraphs76-79 below).41. The Assembly will elect from among its members a presidingofficer, like the Speaker in the House of Commons. The Assembly staff will be answerable to the Assembly not to the Executive.42. The Secretary of State will not be an ex officio member of theAssembly. But the Assembly and the Secretary of State could arrange byagreement for him to attend and address meetings from time to time.The Scottish Executive43. Executive powers in the devolved fields (including the power tomake delegated legislation) will be exercised by a Scottish Executive. these powers will be vested in Members of the Executive, with each of themexercising whatever responsibilities are allocated by the head of theExecutive the Chief Executive.44. The Executive will normally be formed after each election. TheSecretary of State for Scotland will invite a prospective Chief executive to form an Executive which will command the support of the Assembly;in the ordinary course he will invite the leader of the majority party.The prospective Chief Executive will submit the names of his proposedExecutive to the Assembly, which will approve or reject them as a whole.If the Assembly approves, the Secretary of State for Scotland will formallyappoint them as the Executive. If the Assembly rejects the proposed team,the Secretary of State will at his discretion invite the same person to tryagain, or someone else.
45. The Secretary of State will also appoint Assistants to the Executive,on the recommendation of the Chief Executive. These Assistants will bepolitical in character but will not be members of the Executive, nor requireAssembly approval.46. Executive Members and Assistants will normally be members ofthe Assembly, but there will be no rigid rule about this. Some flexibilityis desirable to leave room for possible appointments from outside theAssembly. It may be desirable to include a distinguished person, or one with special expertise (for example in the law), who is not an AssemblyMember; and there will be no second chamber upon which to draw, as there is at Westminster. Political pressures should ensure that the scope for appointing non-members to the Executive is not over-used. TheAssembly&apos;s right to approve or reject the Executive as a whole will be astrong factor.47. Executive Members and Assistants who are not Assembly members will be able to sit and speak in the Assembly, but not to vote.48. Maximum members of Executive Members, and of Members andAssistants combined, will be laid down in the Act. the Secretary of state will have power to increase the numbers later by Order. The pay and allowances of Executive Members and Assistants will be set initially bythe Secretary of State and thereafter by the Assembly.49. Changes in the Executive (including dismissals) will be madeformally by the Secretary of State on the recommendation of the chief executive; Assembly approval will not be required. If a Chief Executivemisused his power of individual change to create a whole new team withoutAssembly approval, the Assembly could pass a vote of censure or no confidence. The members of the Executive will hold office formally at her majesty&apos;s pleasure, and the Secretary of State could in the last resort dis-miss the Executive if he judged that it was holding on to office withoutcommanding adequate support in the Assembly.50. Any departure of the Chief Executive from office will entail the resignation of the whole Executive and the Assistants. The Secretary ofState will have power, without needing Assembly approval, to appoint a&quot;caretaker&quot; Executive to carry on business until a new Assembly-approvedExecutive can be appointed.Scottish Assembly Legislation51. In subjects not devolved, Parliament will continue to make andcontrol legislation for the whole of the United Kingdom. In devolvedsubjects however the Scottish Assembly will become responsible for legislation. At the outset the Executive will administer the law as it now stands; but the Assembly will be free to amend or repeal existing law andto pass new laws of its own.
52. As at Westminster there will be two kinds of legislation-primarylegislation in the form of Scottish Assembly Acts, and secondary legislation in the form of Scottish statutory instruments. These statutory instrumentsmay be made under the authority either of Assembly Acts or of WestminsterActs still applying to Scotland.53. There will be no second chamber. Within the Assembly however the procedure for introducing and considering Bills will be very similar tothat at Westminster. Having passed through all their stages in the Assembly,Bills will be submitted for Assent by Her Majesty in Council through theSecretary of State for Scotland. The following paragraphs set out theprocess leading up to Assent.54. Either the Executive or individual Assembly Members will be ableto introduce Bills (though if Bills introduced by individual Members entailexpenditure they will be able to proceed only with the Executive^ agree-ment). Any differences in handling will be for the Assembly itself to settle.The Act will lay down in broad terms various stages for the handling oflegislation by the Assembly. There will be:  a. a general debate on each Bill, with an opportunity for Members to vote on its general principles;b. consideration of, and an opportunity for Members to vote on andamend, the details of the Bill;c. a final stage at which the Bill can be passed or rejected but notamended.Further elaboration of the procedure will be left to the Assembly&apos;s ownStanding Orders.55. Some special procedure involving the Government will be needed for any Assembly Bill seeking to bind the Crown in respect of matters notdevolved. The Government are considering what form this procedure should take, and at what stage of the Assembly&apos;s legislative process itshould operate.56. The Assembly&apos;s presiding officer, on the advice of his counsel, will report to the Assembly on the vires of a Bill (that is, whether it falls withinthe devolved powers) when it is introduced, and again before the finalAssembly stage; if the report is adverse it will not stop the Bill but will serve as a warning to the Assembly and the Executive. The Governmentwill not be formally involved at these stages, but they will be aware of theBill and the presiding officer&apos;s report and may wish to give informal warn-ing of any difficulties about vires which they foresee. The Scottish authorities will be similarly free, if in doubt, to consult the Government informally.57. When a Bill has passed its final stage in the Assembly it will be forwarded to the Secretary of State. The Government will then consider,with advice from the Law Officers, whether any part of the Bill is ultra vires.In accordance with normal legal principles, ancillary provisions reasonably
incidental to a main purpose falling within a devolved field will be treatedas intra vires even though they may not strictly relate wholly to devolvedsubjects. The Government will also consider whether the Bill is acceptableon general policy grounds.58. In order to be submitted for Assent the Bill must be both intravires and acceptable on policy grounds. If it contains ultra vires provisions,or is unacceptable on policy grounds, or both, the Secretary of State willsend it back to the Assembly with a clear statement of the reasons.59. It will be for the Assembly itself to decide how to handle any Billsreferred back to it. If a Bill referred back as ultra vires is re-submitted tothe Secretary of State in terms still adjudged to be ultra vires, he will tell the Assembly so and the Bill will not go forward for Assent. If a bill referred back on policy grounds is re-submitted in terms which the Govern-ment are still not prepared to accept, they must within a set period from theBill&apos;s receipt by the Secretary of State lay it before Parliament with a notice of motion praying for its rejection. If Parliament affirms this motionthe Assembly will be told that the Bill will not be submitted for Assent.If Parliament rejects the motion the Bill will go forward.60. The Governments reserve powers to halt the progress of AssemblyBills have necessarily been explained at some length. But this does not reflect the spirit in which the Government expect devolution to work, northe features which will be most conspicuous in practical operation. In theordinary course Assembly Bills will be presented for Assent without anytrouble or delay.61. Underlying all these arrangements there will remain the finallegislative sovereignty of Parliament, in which all parts of the UnitedKingdom are represented. Parliament will remain able to pass laws on any matter and for any part of the United Kingdom. Any surrender of thissovereignty would imply federalism, not devolution. Against a background of co-operation and goodwill however Parliament would normally legislateon a devolved matter only where this was agreed with the Scottish admin-istration* as being the convenient course.62. The Scottish Assembly will be constitutionally subordinate toParliament. It will have been created by Parliament and will always remain subject to Parliaments laws, and it will not be free to change the devolutionsettlement. The Government intend however that the Scottish assembly should effectively assume, in the devolved field, the task of making lawsfor Scotland. Bills of the Scottish Assembly will be scrutinised, as explained in paragraphs 56-57, to see whether they are within the devolved powers.The question arises whether, after Assent has been given, an Assembly Act* For convenience, here and elsewhere in the White Paper (except where the context clearly indicates otherwise) the term &quot;administration&quot; in relation to scotland is used in a broad sense to cover both the Assembly and the Executive in theircomplementary roles.
should be open to review in the courts on the grounds of vires-that is,whether the courts should have jurisdiction to declare, at the instance of alitigant, that an Assembly Act goes outside the powers conferred by the devolution Act. The issue is more than just a legal technicality, and thereare arguments both ways.63. In favour of judicial review, it can be argued that this is a normal and natural accompaniment of the operation of a legislature whose powers are limited by law; that the right of the citizen to challenge in the courtsany possible excessive use of power should not be abated; that the limits ofwhat Parliament intended in the devolution Act should be subject to inter-pretation by the courts as specific situations arise in litigation, not merely by Government Ministers inevitably exposed to political pressures and making their judgments in the abstract before experience has been gained of how particular Assembly Acts will work in practical application; and thatexcluding judicial review will complicate the task of the courts, which willin any event have to take account of the devolution Act when they interpretAssembly Acts.64. Against judicial review, it can be argued that its exclusion wouldhave the merits of simplicity and finality and would therefore reduce doubtand room for argument, which might otherwise hamper good government,especially given the unavoidably complex division of responsibilities in the devolution scheme; that the Assembly will be taking over the normalpractical responsibilities of Parliament, and the citizen should be able to rely on its laws as he now can on those of Parliament; that judicial review causedproblems in the operation of the Government of Ireland Act 1920 and wastherefore deliberately excluded by Parliament in enacting the NorthernIreland Constitution Act 1973; and that the three successive checks on viresbefore Assembly Bills become law (see paragraphs 56-57 above) should be asufficient safeguard.65. The Government would welcome public discussion before reaching a final decision.66. There remains private legislation, promoted by private persons and bodies such as local authorities on particular matters which affect them butnot the general public interest. In the devolved fields the Assembly should clearly have power to pass private as well as public legislation. But the procedures are complex, and it would be hard to fit the detail into the Act.The Government therefore envisage that the Act should contain a general provision enabling Her Majesty by Order in Council to provide for the handling of private legislation by the Assembly as soon as a suitable scheme has been worked out. If that has not been achieved by the time the Assemblytakes over its main responsibilities, all Scottish private legislation, including that on devolved subjects, will continue meanwhile to be dealt with byParliament. Present procedures already allow for hearings in Scotland.
Delegated Legislation67. The Scottish Executive will be able to make delegated legislationunder enabling powers contained either in Assembly Acts or in UnitedKingdom Acts still in force in the devolved fields.68. It will be for the Assembly to decide what should go into its ownActs and what should be left to delegated legislation, and also to lay downany procedure required for delegated legislation under its Acts. Anyprocedure in the Scottish Assembly for delegated legislation under UnitedKingdom Acts will be required initially to correspond as closely as possibleto whatever may be required in Parliament by the relevant Act; it is right that the Scottish Executive should at that stage be bound by the procedures for control of delegated legislation which were considered to be a necessarypart of the Act when it was passed. The Assembly will later be free however,in the devolved fields, to pass Acts changing the procedures laid down in theoriginal United Kingdom Act.69. Where a United Kingdom Act in a devolved field lays down, in orderto control expenditure, that delegated legislation shall be made jointly by two or more Ministers or with the consent of the Treasury or the CivilService Department, the power will pass simply to the Scottish Executive.Where a United Kingdom Act confers a power exercisable by Order inCouncil, that power will be exercisable by Order of the Scottish Executive.70. The Assembly will be required in general terms to make arrange-ments for the scrutiny of delegated legislation comparable to those operatedat Westminster through the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. TheAssembly will be able if it wishes to use its &quot;subject&quot; committees (paragraphs76-79 below) for this purpose, or could set up a special committee.United Kingdom Reserve Powers in Executive Matters71. Paragraphs 56-60 above have explained the arrangements there willbe to ensure that in primary legislation the Assembly does not exceed its powers or act in a way that would be seriously harmful. Some similar provision is required to cover other actions that is, executive acts oromissions. (For this purpose the term &quot;executive&quot; includes delegated legislation.)72. There is no point in devolving substantial powers and then maintain-ing detailed oversight from the centre. The Government could not monitoreverything the Scottish administration do, nor indeed should they wish to.Nevertheless, the Government must have power to step in where necessary,either because matters not devolved such as defence are being prejudiced,or for wider reasons of their ultimate responsibility for all the people ofthe United Kingdom.
73. The Government will have to open them three methods, for useeither separately or in combination:  a. for actions in prospect, whether involving a proposed subordinateinstrument or some other proposed executive act, they will be ableto issue a direction prohibiting the action or requiring a particular course of action (including the reversal of a previous action), subjectto an affirmative resolution of Parliament within a specified period;b. for subordinate instruments already made, they will be able to make an annulment Order following an affirmative resolution of Parlia-ment. In case of urgency the Order can be made without askingParliament first, but subject to affirmative resolution within a specified period;c. for other actions already taken, or for omissions, the Governmentwill be able, if the Scottish administration decline to put the matterright, to resume responsibility for the devolved subject in question to the minimum extent necessary for the required place, task orperiod with power to require and direct the use of the administra-tion&apos;s staff and facilities for the purpose. They will do this by Order,subject to affirmative resolution of Parliament. The powers whichthe Government will be able to take by such an Order will be any powers available within statute law applying to Scotland, thoughany requirement for Assembly approval (for example by affirmative resolution on a particular sort of subordinate instrument) will be suspended.74. As with the powers relating to Assembly Bills, these generalprocedures for intervening in the business of the Scottish administrationare not intended for frequent use. They will be there in the backgroundas reserve powers; and they permit wider devolution than would otherwise be possible. Their use will require the specific agreement of Parliament.75. All this is about circumstances in which the Government need to intervene on grounds of policy as distinct from law. The legality of theadministration^ executive acts will be open to challenge in the courtsjust like that of the Governments own executive acts.Assembly Committees76. The Government believe it to be important for the success of theAssembly that all its Members should take a constructive part in the workdevolved to the Scottish administration. The Assembly will therefore havea highly-developed system of committees to advise the Executive andinvestigate what it is doing.77. There will be a committee of Assembly Members corresponding to each of the main subject fields of the Scottish Executive education,health, and so on. The composition of these subject committees will broadlyreflect the political balance of the Assembly as a whole; and they will bechaired by Assembly Members from outside the Executive. Their staff willanswer to them and the Assembly, not to the Executive.
78. Before the introduction of major new policies or Bills, theExecutive Member responsible will have to consult the relevant committeeof the Assembly, except where the matter is especially urgent or confidential.Before a Bill is introduced the committee may discuss its principles andreport on it to the Assembly, as a prelude to general consideration of theBill in plenary session. The Assembly may remit the detailed examinationof a Bill (equivalent to the Committee stage at Westminster) to the mainappropriate subject committee with arrangements to associate any othercommittees whose subjects are affected. The committee may also scrutinisestatutory instruments in its particular field. It will have the right to offersuggestions to the Executive, to initiate discussion and equities on particulartopics, and in general to oversee the work of the corresponding Executivedepartment.79. Officials and documents of the Executive will be under theExecutive^ control; but committees of the Assembly will no doubt ask forExecutive Members and their officials to give oral and written evidence,and it will be in the Executive^ own interest to co-operate.The Civil Service in Scotland80. Members of the Executive will hold office under the Crown, andtheir officials will therefore be civil servants. The Government have considered whether these should constitute a separate Scottish civil service,or be part of the United Kingdom civil service. Most of them will inpractice be people who are now United Kingdom civil servants in theScottish Office.81. The Kilbrandon Commission thought that there would have to bea separate civil service, on the grounds that a devolved administration would wish to choose its own senior officials, might not be content for generalpersonnel matters to be handled by a Government Department, and would want to be able to rely on the undivided loyalty of their officials dealingwith the Government, for example on the block grant.82. There are however strong arguments for maintaining a unified service. It would help the consultation and co-operation on which thesuccess of devolution will heavily depend. Present experience does not suggest that with a single service there need be divided loyalty; civil servantsby tradition give wholehearted service to whichever Ministers are in chargeof their Departments. We cannot assume that all staff will wish to transfer to a service entirely separate from that to which they were recruited, wherethe work, conditions and prospects might become substantially different.83. Other factors must be taken into account. A separate service would need more staff (for example to handle personnel matters now dealtwith centrally). A unified service would enable the Scottish Executive todraw its officials more easily from a wide pool of talent and experience.The wishes of the Scottish administration itself will be important, and these
cannot be known until it is in being. Finally, even if a separate Scottishservice were desirable it could not be set up for some years; it is an optiononly for the longer term.84. The Government believe that it will be in the best interests of all to keep a unified United Kingdom civil service. Any proposal for change would be a matter for discussion with the Scottish administration; staff representatives would be consulted at all stages. It would be essential tomaintain the traditional independence of the recruitment system.85.   Numbers and costs of staff are dealt with in Part VI.Complaints Machinery86. Complaints against Government Departments can be investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the &quot;Ombudsman&quot;.Corresponding arrangements for the devolved subjects will need to be laiddown in the Act. The details are outlined in Appendix B. The basic system for this important safeguard of the citizen&apos;s rights will be laid down byParliament; but the new Scottish Commissioner will report to the Assembly.European Community and Other International Aspects87. The Government must remain responsible for all international relations, including those concerned with our membership of the european community; no other course would be compatible with political unity. every member state of the Community including West Germany, for all itsinternal structure of federalism is represented solely by its central govern-ment on the various bodies which deal with Community policy. It is theUnited Kingdom as a whole that is a member of the Community, and its government must remain its sole spokesman, in the Community as in other international business.88. Nevertheless, both in European Community and in other contextsinternational business touches increasingly on matters which will be devolved.The views of the Scottish administration on these matters, reflecting theirown contacts with others concerned within Scotland such as local authorities,must be taken into account.89. No formal statutory machinery is needed for consultation; it willbe better to develop pragmatic arrangements between members and officials of the Scottish administration and the Government. These might operatemost effectively through the Secretary of State for Scotland and throughthe particular Ministers representing the United Kingdom in Brussels or elsewhere.90. There remains the question of how to ensure that any relevantinternational obligations are observed in the devolved fields in Scotland.There are two aspects to this: firstly ensuring that existing obligations arenot breached, and secondly arranging that any positive action needed to fulfil new obligations is taken.
91. Breach of international obligation will be avoided in the normal way through the close consultation which the Government intend to main-tain with the Scottish Executive. If, exceptionally, this does not work forany reason, and the Scottish Assembly sends forward a Bill or the Executivetakes some action contrary to the United Kingdom&apos;s international obli-gations, the Government will be able to use their reserve powers for dealingwith matters unacceptable on policy grounds. These powers have been explained in paragraphs 58-59 and 73 above. However, since internationalobligation is essentially a matter of fact and law (often involved andtechnical) rather than of general political judgment, the use of reserve powers in these cases will not require the approval of Parliament.92. Ensuring that positive action is taken as needed to fulfil newEuropean Community or other obligations is complex. On the one hand,the Government are answerable for getting this done. On the other, theScottish administration, which will best know their own circumstances and legislation, ought not to be completely cut out of particular matters withindevolved subjects whenever international commitments (including the increasing number of European Community ones) happen to touch on them.The best way of resolving this is for the Government to keep formalresponsibility for all matters relating to international obligations, even when these matters arise in fields otherwise devolved; but for there to be power for the Government at their discretion to delegate to the Scottish adminis-tration, by Order, the job of taking any necessary action, whether legislative or executive, to implement the obligation. The power will be a flexible one,which can be used to delegate action either on a particular item, such as an individual European Community directive, or in a general field. TheGovernment envisage that in practice it might well become the normal course to delegate implementation by agreement to the Scottish administration. the devolution Act will add the administration to the category of those who canbe designated as implementing authorities under the European CommunitiesAct 1972.C.   FINANCE AND TAXATION93. Financial arrangements lie at the heart of any scheme. Those whichthe Government have chosen reflect their general approach to devolution,recognising continued political and economic unity and the need for close co-operation. Paragraphs 94-100 below explain the basic concepts, andparagraphs 101-113 set out their detailed application.The Basic Concepts&quot;94. The White Paper of September 1974 proposed that, as recom-mended by the Kilbrandon Commission, the financial allocation for the devolved,services should be in the form of a block grant voted by Parlia-ment, taking account both of local needs and of the desirability of someuniformity of standards and contributions in all parts of the United King-dom; and that it should therefore be for the Assemblies to judge amongcompeting claims.
95. Further study has confirmed that this is inescapable. Economic unityrequires a system which considers the expenditure needs of the whole UnitedKingdom, including the claims of regions with special problems. This requires a decision each year on public expenditure for all parts of the UnitedKingdom by the Government, answerable to Parliament.96. In theory one might base public expenditure for Scotland onrevenues arising there. But even if they could be identified unequivocally,such a system would be quite incompatible with distribution according to need.97. The Government are well aware that the discovery of major oilfieldsunder the North Sea has given rise to ideas of a quite different kind. Thereare some who argue that oil revenues should be controlled directly by those parts of the United Kingdom off whose shores the oil is found, whatever the effect elsewhere. Let there be no misunderstanding: such a proposal whether its advocates realise this or not would mean the break-up of theUnited Kingdom. The Government believe that oil must be treated in thesame way as other national resources (like the big coal deposits recentlyfound in England, and the natural gas off its shores) and the benefits broughtinto the national pool for distribution in accordance with relative needs. Anyother course could destroy not only economic unity but also political unity.Those who wish to reserve to Scotland oil or other revenues arising thereare in effect demanding a separate Scottish state. The circle cannot besquared: it is not possible for Scotland or any other part of the UnitedKingdom to enjoy rights which can only go with separatism yet not tohave separatism itself.98. For their part, the Government rule out separatism. Even if on an arrow economic calculation Scotland might be better off materially for atime by keeping the benefits of oil exclusively to itself and such a calcula-tion would be at best highly precarious, resting on limited reserves of asingle commodity whose value varies with the world market the Govern-ment are convinced that the Scottish people are overwhelmingly opposedto destroying the Union. The Government repeat their pledge that allthe parts of the United Kingdom most in need will receive their full and fair share of the benefits from the energy resources of the continental shelf, which belong to the United Kingdom as a whole.99. The Government accordingly intend that Scottish public expenditure should be settled as part of the annual public expenditure review for theUnited Kingdom as a whole. The amount will be a matter for politicaljudgment, on the basis of an assessment of relative needs made jointly with the Scottish administration through close and continuous collaboration.Once the relative amounts of public expenditure are established, Parlia-ment will be asked to vote the appropriate element for the devolved services in the form of a block grant. In 1974-75 public expenditure on the servicesproposed for devolution was about  2,000 million, with a further sum ofmore than  100 million met by local authorities as loan charges. Had theproposed financial arrangements been in operation this would have involved
a block grant of more than  1,300 million, local authority taxation of 300 million and borrowing of about  500 million. Expenditure on the devolved services would have come to nearly three-fifths of total identifiablepublic expenditure in Scotland.100. No neat formula could be devised to produce fair shares forScotland (and for England, Wales and Northern Ireland) in varyingcircumstances from year to year. The task involves judgments of greatcomplexity and political sensitivity. Nevertheless, objective information onstandards and needs would help the Scottish administration, the Govern-ment and Parliament to make their judgments. Various arrangements might be adopted for collecting such information, and the Governmentwill discuss possibilities with the Scottish administration.The Block Grant101. Once the block grant has been voted by Parliament, it will bepaid over at regular intervals during the financial year. Accountability forthe expenditure will run not to Parliament but to the Assemblies. the devolution Act must lay down certain basic features of the financial control system, but its running will be overseen by the Scottish Assembly.102. The Scottish administration will have the fullest possible freedom to decide how the money from the block grant should be spent how much, for example, should go on roads, houses, schools and hospitals, and where in Scotland it should be spent. As the figures in paragraph 99demonstrate, this is a major economic as well as social power. It will givethe administration a powerful new instrument for shaping developmentsover a wide range of services.103. The Governments decision on the total amount for all the devolved services will not be a matter of simply imposing an arbitrary figure.It will be the outcome of a close and thorough process of consultation eachyear with the Scottish administration. Appendix C outlines how the processmight run in a typical year.104. The administration will base their proposals on their view of scottish needs in the devolved fields. But the Government must take account also of other needs, both elsewhere in the United Kingdom andin non-devolved fields within Scotland. All these needs must then be related to what the United Kingdom can afford for public expenditure against other claims, including the balance of payments, private investment and private consumption, as well as the needs of public industries such as coal andsteel which will continue to be very important to Scotland.105. With understanding on both sides agreement should usually bereached on a total accepted as fair both to Scotland and to the rest of theUnited Kingdom. If agreement is not reached the matter will have to besettled by the Government, answerable to Parliament. Parliament, withits Scottish MPs alongside those from all other parts of the United Kingdom,is the right body to vote the amount for the devolved services, and to
settle the statutory limits on the administration^ short-term borrowing andon issues to the Scottish Loans Fund.Taxation106. Scottish taxpayers will continue to pay United Kingdom taxes at united Kingdom rates, and these payments will contribute to the centralpool of national resources from which the block grant and other national expenditure will be financed according to needs.107. The Government have particularly considered whether theScottish administration should be able to levy taxes. As already explained,there can be no question of sharing responsibility for taxation generally or of reserving for Scotland revenues raised there. The issue is ratherwhether the administration should have power to levy limited additionaltaxation, in order to finance extra expenditure which they think especially important. The burden would have to fall solely on Scottish taxpayers, asthe people getting the benefits of the extra expenditure.108. The people of Scotland may not want to pay more taxes regularlyyear after year in order to finance more public expenditure than the assess-ment of their needs in the United Kingdom context provides. Nevertheless,some powers for the devolved administrations to levy additional taxationwould give them greater freedom. It is however difficult to identify suitableforms of tax. There is no point, for example, in choosing taxes unlikely to yield enough revenue to give much extra discretion; and it would be wrong to choose ones which would fall too narrowly on particular groups.Among the specific possibilities which have been considered, the twofound to merit the most detailed study were a retail sales tax (distinct from VAT) and a surcharge on income tax. The studies showed that, for either of these, there would be great administrative complexities for bothtaxpayers and tax administrations; and also heavy costs, falling on retailersor employers as well as on the devolved administrations, for collectionsystems which would still need to be maintained and paid for whether ornot any extra taxes were levied in a particular year. Both possibilities were therefore unsuited for use as supplementary taxes to be applied at a low rate and turned on and off from time to time. The Government have therefore concluded that the only tax power suitable for devolution is ageneral power to levy a surcharge on local authority taxation, whether onthe rates as at present or on any new system introduced in the future (forexample after the Committee of Inquiry into Local Government Finance the Layfield Committee has reported). No tax is popular, but a power ofthis kind would give the Scottish administration a useful degree of discretion.They will not have to use it unless they run into deficit or deliberately aimfor a higher level of expenditure, for example to meet some particularScottish priority for which they judge people would be willing to accepthigher burdens.109. Local authorities, who will run many of the devolved services,can settle their own levels of taxation, so that there will in any event be some flexibility in the total amount available for the services in Scotland.
The Scottish administration will decide both how much of the block grant should be distributed to local government and how to allocate it amongindividual authorities. In calculating block grant the Government willin general assume that Scottish local authorities will receive, in relation totheir expenditure needs and their taxable resources, provision comparable with that for local authorities in England; whether they in fact levy moreor less local tax, and are assigned more or less subsidy from the block grant, will be a matter to be settled in Scotland.110. The sources of local authority taxation will be the same as inEngland. The Scottish Assembly will have legislative powers to adjust theapplication of the system of rating and valuation for rating to suit localconditions; but only Parliament will be able to authorise new forms oflocal taxation.Other Sources of Finance111. Capital expenditure by local authorities and by other public bodies in devolved fields will continue to be financed by borrowing. Localauthorities will continue to have access to the Public Works Loan Board.Other public bodies will have access to a new Scottish Loans Fund for longer-term borrowing, financed from the National Loans Fund and controlled by the Scottish administration. The main condition on its use will be thaton-lending should not be at a lower rate of interest than the correspondingloan from the National Loans Fund. The only long-term borrowing trans-actions controlled individually by the Government will be those involvingforeign currency or overseas sources. However, the Government must alsocontrol both the total amount of long-term borrowing and within this thetotal of borrowing from official sources by local authorities and public corporations. These controls are essential for the management of theUnited Kingdom economy.Financial Control and Audit112. The Act will lay down certain basic features to ensure that there isa sound system for authorising expenditure and reporting on the accounts.In addition to the Scottish Loans Fund, there will be Scottish counterpartsof the Consolidated Fund, the Comptroller and Auditor General and thePublic Accounts Committee. The Assembly will have power to appropriatefunds to individual services by Assembly Order, corresponding to appropriate-ation Acts at Westminster.113. Responsibility for controlling issues from the Scottish Funds andfor supervising the arrangements for monitoring and audit will rest squarelywith Scottish bodies. The reports of the Scottish Comptroller and AuditorGeneral will be presented to the Assembly and considered by the ScottishAccounts Committee, and it will be for the Assembly to decide whether torequire comments or proposals from the Executive as a result. The Act will however require the publication of these reports, so that expenditure ondevolved matters undergoes the same public scrutiny as the correspondingexpenditure does now.
D.   THE DEVOLVED SUBJECTSThe General Approach114. It is important to recognise what legislative devolution will mean.Where a subject field is devolved, responsibility for the activities of govern-ment in that field will be transferred to the Scottish administration. Devolvinga subject field in Scotland will not however be like transferring functions between Government Departments or between local authorities; it will meanmuch more. The present law will be inherited, but the administration willbe free to change it. They will not be confined to the activities going onnow. They could end these activities, or run them in different ways, or createquite new activities.115. The Government intend to apply this far-reaching concept to amassive hand-over of responsibility for Scotland&apos;s affairs.116. The Act will devolve certain subjects; anything not shown asdevolved will remain the direct responsibility of the Government and parliament as at present. The Government have in general approached thetask of deciding which subjects to devolve from the positive standpoint ofdevolving wherever possible, and keeping subjects back (or making excep-tions within subjects otherwise devolved) only where there is cogent reasonfor doing so for example where devolution might risk damaging basicunity and the fundamental rights of United Kingdom citizenship, or wherewider uniformity is plainly needed, or where devolving or dividing a subject would be very awkward to work.117. Paragraphs 119-168 below set out the effect of applying this approach, and Appendix D gives a tabular summary. The government believe that the result is well suited to the interests of Scotland and of theUnited Kingdom as a whole, and that the scale and character of the devolvedresponsibilities will enable the Scottish administration to take a broad and comprehensive view of their tasks in serving the people of Scotland.118. The responsibilities to be transferred on devolution in the variousfields will be those which the Government now carry. The proposals do notentail any removal of current tasks or powers from local government.Local Government119. Responsibility for central government supervision of most aspectsof local government in Scotland will be devolved. The administration willoversee the work of local authorities in devolved matters, will allocaterate support grant to them, will control their capital investment in the devolved fields and will be responsible for the application of the local taxation system, as explained in paragraphs 109-110. The devolution Actwill not change local government structure. The Government believe thatit would not be in the interests of either the Assembly or Scottish localgovernment for the new structure of local authorities and the distribution
of functions among them to be radically revised again in the next fewyears. These must however be matters in future for the Assembly; and itwill be empowered to legislate on local government administrative andelectoral boundaries, the detailed application of the rating system and the division of devolved functions between local authorities and the ScottishExecutive, as well as on the structure of local government itself.120. Responsibility will not be devolved for determining the qualifica-tions for voting in local government elections; the qualifications and dis-qualifications for membership of local authorities; the voting system for local government elections; and the frequency with which they are held. These basic democratic features of the local government system should remain under the direct authority of Parliament.121. The Scottish administration will not of course be responsible forany functions which Scottish local authorities continue to carry out inmatters not devolved; the responsibilities of central and local governmentin these matters will not be changed by the Act.Health122. The Scottish administration will be responsible for health matters in Scotland, including the National Health Service. This means that theywill be free to determine arrangements and priorities for the provision ofhealth care, including the resources to be allocated. In this as in other fields (see paragraph 160 below), certain United Kingdom arrangements and standards will continue to apply for example on medicines and drugs but in general the administration will be able to vary the scope and character of current arrangements, and to decide policy on such matters as family planning, transplant surgery, abortion, private practice and thecontrol of nursing homes.Social Work123. The Scottish administration will be responsible for the social workservices, such as the care of children, the elderly, the handicapped andothers in need of special care or support. They will be able to control the standards of private provision in these fields, and to make grants to voluntary bodies.Social Security124. The social security system, which provides a network of cash benefits payable to individuals and families, will not be devolved. It isnecessary to keep a single system of cash benefits designed to maintain adecent minimum standard of living for every citizen throughout the UnitedKingdom. The war pensions scheme will also remain on a United Kingdombasis.125. Some problems arise because of the close and often complicatedinteraction between social security benefits and schemes for rent and rate
rebates, rent allowances, and the minimum charges and personal allowances for those living in local authority homes. The Government^ approval willbe required for any changes in such schemes which would affect whollyor mainly people receiving supplementary benefits, or people who would receive them if the changes were made. The reason for this special provision is that the burden would then fall directly on United Kingdomfunds, not the block grant or the rates. It is a more open question whether,because of the complexity of the interaction with social security generally,it would be better not to devolve powers relating to such schemes at all.The Government would welcome comments from bodies working in this field.Education, Science and the Arts126. The Scottish administration will be responsible for all educational and cultural matters other than those noted in paragraphs 127-129 below.They will control the schools system in Scotland, and will be able if they wish to determine (for example) its standards and structure, its curricula,its attendance requirements such as age levels, and policy for privateschools and nursery education. They will be responsible for youth and community services and for all further and higher education except the universities.127. Responsibility for the universities will not be devolved. TheGovernment believe that it is in the best interests of the United Kingdom,including Scotland, that they should continue to be run as part of a widerUnited Kingdom system and under the supervision of a single university grants Committee. At the same time, the Government attach importanceto close and effective liaison between the Scottish universities and those other parts of the higher education system that will come under the controlof the Scottish administration. The University Grants Committee will there-fore be asked to devise arrangements recognising the specific Scottishdimension of their business, and linking the Scottish administration withthese arrangements.128. It would make no sense to break up the Research Councils5&quot;, and responsibility for them will not be devolved. The Scottish administration will be able (preferably in consultation with Government Departmentsconcerned) to commission research from them. Responsibility for theNature Conservancy Council will similarly not be devolved.129. Partly because of the decisions explained in paragraphs 127-128,and partly also to avoid difficulties or friction in the present wide inter-change of students among higher education establishments throughout theUnited Kingdom, responsibility will not be devolved for postgraduateawards and for awards to Scottish domiciled students on university andother courses of advanced further education (though the Scottish admini-*The main civil ones are the Agricultural, Medical, Natural Environment, science and Social Science Research Councils.
stration will be responsible for policy on awards made by education autho-rities to students following other courses of further education).130. The administration will be responsible for the arts (except theexport control of works of art) and for national and local libraries,museums and galleries.Housing131. The Scottish administration will be responsible for all aspects of housing, except that in order to maintain proper management of theUnited Kingdom economy the Government will remain responsible for housing finance in the private sector (building society mortgages and the like), and will also keep a reserve power to prevent or restrict increases in public and private sector rents where general economic and counter-inflationary policy makes this necessary. These limited qualifications apart,the Scottish administration will be able to have their own laws and policies,for both the public and the private sectors, on the provision and upkeepof accommodation, the control of rents, subsidies to local authorities and housing associations, renovation, building standards and slum clearance.Physical Planning and the Environment132. The Scottish administration will be generally responsible for physical planning and the environment. They will deal with the various aspects of land use how to manage its development and control, how toco-ordinate land use planning with (for example) transport planning, and how to provide the general infrastructure needed for Scotland&apos;s prosperity.They will deal with the general improvement of the environment; the rehabilitation of derelict land; all aspects of water such as supply, amenityplanning, arterial drainage, sewerage and sewage disposal; new towns; andthe protection of countryside amenity and landscape.133. The administration^ powers over land must however be qualified.Firstly, it is essential that the new community land legislation should applyuniformly; divergences could lead to damaging economic distortions. TheScottish administration will however have substantial supervisory functions under the legislation. Secondly, the devolution of planning powers will besubject to a continuing right which should not need to be used often for the Government to &quot;call in&quot; any particular planning issue for their decision if the general United Kingdom interest is affected, for exampleon non-devolved matters like defence. The Government will probably also need to keep the right to settle any disputes over compulsory purchaseaffecting such matters.134. The Scottish administration will be responsible for sport and recreation, parks and open spaces, ancient monuments and historic build-ings, public and civic amenities, and a variety of other matters like refusecollection and disposal, cemeteries, markets, fairs and allotments. Theywill be responsible also for dealing with natural emergencies (though any use of the armed forces to help in these must of course remain a matter for the Government). They will be responsible for protecting the environ-
ment, including preventing nuisances, atmospheric pollution and noise,except that their powers will not extend to aircraft, motor vehicles and ships; some aspects of these are the subject of international agreements and others raise defence or other national considerations, so that theymust remain matters for the Government.Roads and Transport135. The Scottish administration will be responsible for a wide range oftransport matters. These will include the planning, construction and stand-ards of roads; the application of traffic rules (except on motorways, whereuniformity throughout Great Britain is important for safety); road safetypublicity; local transport planning, including matters relating to passenger transport areas; road service licensing, including appointing Traffic Com-missioners and deciding appeals arising from their decisions; bus and shipping services of the Scottish Transport Group; subsidies for shipping and air services to the Highlands and Islands, and for improving piers and boat-slips; inland waterways; examining and paying claims for new bus grants;the current powers to pay fuel duty rebate to bus operators; and generaloversight of local authority powers to subsidise passenger transport services,including rail and bus services.136. There are certain matters in the field of road transport where, forsafety reasons, practice needs to be the same throughout Great Britain. these include framing (as distinct from applying) rules for traffic management;motoring offences; the Highway Code; the system for testing and licensingdrivers and public service vehicles; and the transport of dangerous sub-stances. Responsibility for these will not be devolved.137. Responsibility for local authority airports will be devolved fromthe outset. For airports owned and operated by the British airports authority the Government will discuss future arrangements with the scottish administration, and aim to achieve a transfer of responsibility while retaining the managerial expertise of the Authority in Scotland. Similar arrangements would be made for aerodromes owned and operated by the Civil aviation authority.Development and Industry138. The Scottish Development Agency will have a key role in both theenvironmental field and the industrial field. The devolution Act will notchange the powers of the Agency. Its environmental and factory buildingfunctions will be fully devolved, except that the terms of disposal of factoriesmust remain under Government control it would not be in the interests ofany part of the United Kingdom to create the possibility of a price war inmaking industrial premises available to attract incoming firms. The other industrial functions of the Agency cannot be devolved, because of the need to preserve economic unity; the arrangements for dealing with these are setout in Part V, on the role of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Half the
members of the Board of the Agency will be appointed by the scottish administration, which will also be consulted before the Secretary of Stateappoints the Chairman.139. For the Highlands and Islands Development Board, which dealswith a range of specialised problems, responsibility for both economic and social activities will be devolved. The Scottish administration will appoint the Chairman and members, and in devolved fields such as tourism will have full discretion in supervising the Board&apos;s activities. But for Board activities in reserved fields, for example assistance to industry, fishing and agriculture,the Government will lay down a system of guidelines and cash limits on individual projects within which the Board and the Scottish administration will decide their own priorities; major industrial projects will be reserved tothe Scottish Development Agency and the Secretary of State. Changes in theBoard&apos;s powers and the geographical area which it covers will also be amatter for the Secretary of State.140. There can be no question of breaking up the main nationalised industries or splitting responsibility for them. The Government envisagehowever that there should be informal contacts between them and theScottish administration on matters of joint interest, and that they should include in their reports information on recent developments and future plans for Scotland. The administration will be able to consider these reports, andto make representations to the industries or to Ministers.141. Relations with industry and commerce are an important element of managing the United Kingdom economy as a whole. Government Depart-ments operating on a central basis will therefore keep their present statutoryfunctions; but they will consult the Office of the Secretary of State or theScottish administration on matters of common concern.Natural Resources142. The Scottish administration will be responsible for functions relat-ing to land and natural resources now carried out by the Department ofAgriculture and Fisheries for Scotland. These will include crofting and fresh-water fisheries, and also forestry functions-especially important in Scotland with the exception (an essential consequence of United Kingdom unity)of fiscal, regulatory and international aspects. The Act will maintain the forestry Commission, already based in Edinburgh, as the instrument forcarrying out Scottish policies. For these it will be financed by and account-able to the Scottish administration.143. The administration will be responsible also for the management of agricultural estates now vested in the Secretary of State for Scotland,and for the improvement of fisheries harbours. The main aspects of agri-culture and sea fisheries are however too bound up with overall UnitedKingdom economic management and international agreements for devolution to be practicable (see paragraph 280).
Law and the Legal System144. The separate character of Scots law and of the Scottish legalsystem was specially recognised in the Union between Scotland and England,and in this distinctively Scottish field the Government believe that extensivedevolution is particularly appropriate.145. The Scottish administration will have wide responsibilities inthe range of subjects constituting Scots private law, such as the law ofpersons, delict, contract, property, trusts and succession. The government recognise the importance of the development and reform of Scots law asa coherent and distinctive system. There is however a complex interactionbetween those subjects and areas such as company law, industrial relations and consumer protection where consistency with the law in other partsof the United Kingdom is particularly important, for example in order tomaintain a common framework for trade. Further study is proceeding to find the best way of reconciling maximum devolution in the field ofprivate law with these wider United Kingdom interests.146. The Scottish Law Commission will continue after devolution to have a major role in the coherent development of the whole of Scotslaw, whether in devolved or non-devolved matters. Because the Commission^functions will span both fields, legislative responsibility for its constitution and structure must remain with Parliament. The Scottish administration will however be responsible for appointing the Chairman and membersof the Commission, for its running and for its general programme of work,though the Government will remain able to refer non-devolved matters toit.147. The Scottish administration will also be given responsibility forthe general criminal law, including the right to create new offences, toredefine or abolish existing offences, to determine penalties and to regulate the treatment of offenders (including prisons). There will however be certain exceptions. Firstly, there are those that may affect the security ofthe state, like the law on treason, espionage and measures against terrorism.Secondly, there are areas where the law can work efficiently only if it isuniform, such as explosives, firearms, and dangerous drugs and poisons.Finally, there are offences relating essentially to subject fields which willnot be devolved, like taxation and road traffic law.148. The enforcement of the criminal law through the police and the prosecution system-which in Scotland is not in any way under the controlof the police is part of the responsibility of the Government for themaintenance of law and order and the security of the state, and will extend to offences within both devolved and other fields. It would not be right that responsibility for law enforcement should rest with members of an administration not directly answerable to Parliament. The Secretary ofState and the Lord Advocate will therefore retain their present responsi-bilities with regard to police and prosecution respectively. The police will retain their existing status and their relationship with local authorities, andthe function of prosecution will continue to be exercised through the CrownOffice and the procurator fiscal service.
149. The Government have considered with special care where respon-sibility should lie for the main Scottish courts the supreme courts (theHigh Court of Justiciary and the Court of Session), the sheriff courts andthe district courts. The Government are satisfied that responsibility for thedifferent levels ought not to be split separation would pose difficult problems over such matters as jurisdiction, procedure and administration.They believe that the supreme court judges should continue to be appointedby The Queen on the recommendation of the Government, and that respon-sibility for their tenure and conditions of office should not be devolved.The Government also believe that questions affecting the right of appeal from the Court of Session to the House of Lords the court of final appealin civil matters from the courts of every part of the United Kingdom must remain a United Kingdom responsibility.150. There remains however the question whether responsibility forthe court system and its administration should remain with the Governmentand Parliament, or should be devolved subject to the qualifications noted in the previous paragraph. There are powerful arguments on both sides.The courts are a distinctive part of the Scottish legal heritage, and may therefore seem wholly suitable to be entrusted to the care of Scotland&apos;snew Assembly, under Parliaments continuing ultimate sovereignty. the concept of the development of Scots law as a coherent system argues infavour of devolving the courts and the legal system along with the sub-substantive law. It may be difficult, if responsibility is split, to decide theallocation of such border-line topics as court procedure and the law ofevidence. On the other hand, it is arguable that the courts are essentialelements in the core of constitutional unity of the United Kingdom andin the fabric of law and order; and that since they have to deal withdisputes involving both devolved and non-devolved law, they should notbe the responsibility of an Assembly which has no functions in the non-devolved fields. The same factors of public policy and national security which are relevant to the police and prosecution functions (paragraph 148above) point towards maintaining United Kingdom responsibility for thecourts and their jurisdiction, administration and procedure.151. The Government would welcome public comment and discussionbefore taking a final decision on this question.Tourism152. The Scottish administration will be responsible for tourism inScotland, including the Scottish Tourist Board. Overseas promotion willremain the responsibility of the British Tourist Authority, which will receivefunds from the Government for promoting tourism to Scotland as wellas to England and Wales. If the Scottish administration want to give theAuthority extra funds for specific promotions overseas, or to give workto other agencies, they will be free to do so; but they will not receive extraUnited Kingdom funds for these purposes.Other Matters153.   The administration will be responsible also for a wide variety
of other matters such as fire services; betting, gaming and lotteries; fixingpublic holidays and summer time; the registration of theatrical employers;controlling charitable collections; Sunday observance; shop hours; thefunctions now carried out by the Registrar General for Scotland such asthe registration of births, marriages and deaths and the administration of marriage law (but not the national census paragraph 165 below); and the licensing of taxis, liquor, and places of entertainment.154. It will not be possible to decide whether the administration shouldhave a role in relation to broadcasting until the Committee on the Futureof Broadcasting, under the chairmanship of Lord Annan, has reported.Technical factors and international obligations will in any event make it essential to keep central control of frequencies and transmitter power.Nominated Bodies155. The Scottish administration will be responsible for nominatedbodies operating wholly in Scotland on devolved matters unless, exception-ally, it proves necessary in a particular case to set special limitations. this responsibility will include financing, accountability, reporting and appoint-ments (though recommendations for appointments by the Crown will need to be made through the Secretary of State). The administration will inheritall powers under existing legislation affecting those bodies, and will beable to change that legislation if they wish, including abolishing the bodies or creating new ones. If changes are needed in bodies constituted by RoyalCharter or Warrant, these bodies will themselves have to apply for thenecessary amendments to their constitutions.156. Bodies operating in Scotland in devolved matters but organised on a United Kingdom or Great Britain basis raise more complicated prob-lems. They will continue initially to operate as they do now; they will haveno formal accountability to the Scottish administration and, where they arefinanced now through Parliament, this will continue. However, by normalconsultation and agreement the Government will be able to secure changesin their activities and membership, and executive bodies will be able toact as the agents of the Scottish administration, provided all this can bearranged within the broad scope of the body&apos;s general policy, its legal powers and, where appropriate, its continuing primary responsibility tothe Government. There will also be provision for the Government, byOrder subject to affirmative resolution of Parliament, to make any legalchanges which may be needed in the formal structure and powers of aparticular body in order to reflect any agreement between them and theScottish administration, in consultation with the body itself. In the last resort, however, if agreement is not reached on either informal or formaladjustments, the Scottish administration will be free to make quite new arrangements and terminate a particular body&apos;s responsibilities in Scotland(unless, exceptionally, the devolution Act contains special provisions abouta particular body, like those for the Forestry Commission envisaged inparagraph 142).157. The staff of a nominated body operating wholly in Scotland ina devolved field who are civil servants will be treated like other civil servants
in the devolved fields; they will continue to belong to a unified UnitedKingdom service. Any consultations between the administration and theGovernment about setting up a separate Scottish civil service (paragraph84 above) would include the future of civil servants serving with nominatedbodies. The Scottish administration will inherit whatever responsibilities theGovernment now have in relation to staff who are not civil servants.158. With nominated bodies operating on a United Kingdom or GreatBritain basis (paragraph 156), there will be no change in responsibility forstaff matters.159. Appendix E lists nominated bodies to which the arrangements in paragraphs 155-158 above are expected to apply.General Standards160. There are a number of matters in which common rules and standards are important, either for safety or to maintain a fair and con-sistent framework for industry and commerce everywhere. These cover the regulation or statutory standards of marketing, composition, labelling and performance of commonly traded articles or goods, including in particularfood (and its handling), medicines, drugs, animal feedingstuffs and pesti-cides; construction standards for vehicles; and safety standards for fuel-burning appliances, for the use of gas, and for articles used in the homesuch as inflammable textiles. They also include trades unions, industrial relations and the rights of employees; consumer credit; export credit; corn-petition policy; fair trading; insurance; patents, trade marks, designs andcopyright; weights and measures; and shipping and civil aviation. Respon-sibility for these matters, even where they affect fields otherwise devolved,must in general remain with the Government, though as explained in para-graph 145 above the relationship between the Government^ responsibility and the responsibilities to be devolved in the field of Scots private law needsfurther study.Pay in the Public Sector161. The Government must retain in their hands all the means neces-sary to fight inflation, including the degree of control or influence they now have over public sector pay and related conditions, including pensions.The Scottish administration^ powers over pay and conditions in the devolved services cannot therefore be unlimited; their decisions will need to be related to wider considerations of national economic or pay policy. Accord-ingly, there will be a general requirement in the Act for the administration to take account of any such wider considerations brought specially to their attention by the Government. In addition, in fields where the government now exercise, in one way or another, general control over pay and con-ditions of service (as in the health service) the consent of the Secretary ofState will be required for any changes. Moreover, the Government expect that where pay in any area of the public services is now settled by nationalnegotiations or arrangements covering the whole of Great Britain these will continue with appropriate representation for the Scottish administra-
tion after devolution, whether or not the Secretary of State&apos;s consent isrequired to the outcome.Regulation of the Professions162. There are certain occupational groups whose training is controlled by statute, or which have legal powers of self-regulation whereby onlypeople recognised by the group can lawfully claim to be qualified to practiseits skills. The question arises how far the Scottish administration shouldbe able to legislate about the regulation of such groups.163. The Government wish to hear comments from appropriate pro-fessional bodies before reaching a definite conclusion; but they provisionallyfavour devolving power to legislate about the control only of professionswhich in Scotland will be mainly employed by or under contract to theScottish administration or bodies subordinate to it; examples would beteachers, the health professions and town planners, but not, say, architectsor engineers. The Government also provisionally favour devolving power to legislate about the control of the distinctively Scottish legal profession.Statistics and Other Information164. The right to collect relevant statistics and other information goesnaturally with responsibility for particular services and the Scottish admin-istration will have this right in the devolved fields. The Government expect that, through consultation, the administration would seek to avoid collectiondemands overlapping with those of the United Kingdom, and to achieveconsistency and compatibility with data from other parts of the UnitedKingdom.165. The national population censuses gather important informationrelevant to both devolved and non-devolved matters. They must therefore remain basically a matter for the Government. The Government would however take into account any views of the Scottish administration in determining the scope and content of census-taking, and would hope tocontinue to conduct it through the Registrar General for Scotland, whoseother functions will come under the Scottish administration.166. The Government will continue to need information on devolved services, for example on matters where they have to provide consistentUnited Kingdom data to international organisations. Such information wouldbe supplied normally through consultation and agreement; but to ensurethat they remain able to meet their responsibilities there will be a general provision in the Act requiring the Scottish administration to furnish infor-mation to the Government on request. The Government for their part would seek to respond helpfully to any needs which the Scottish administration had for information on matters not devolved.167. The Scottish administration and the Government will be boundto safeguard each other&apos;s confidential information, and the law on the pro-
tection of official information will apply in devolved matters as it doesnow in Government matters. The Assembly could however make new lawsif it wished about its own information on devolved matters.Tribunals and Inquiries168. Within devolved fields, the Scottish administration will inheritany existing statutory powers relating to the establishment or constitutionof tribunals and inquiries. They will be able also, if they wish, to changethese inherited powers, to set up new tribunals and to make rules of pro-cedure. The Council on Tribunals and its Scottish Committee, which covermatters that will not be devolved as well as those that will, will remain a united Kingdom responsibility.E.   SUMMARY OF THE SCHEME FOR SCOTLAND169. These proposals will create for Scotland an elected assembly which across a great range of subjects will take over the work of Parliament;and they will create a Scottish Executive which, in these subjects, will havewide responsibilities now borne by the Government.170. There are some specific restrictions and some general constitutionalsafeguards, but in practice formal intervention by the Government shouldbe exceptional. Within the devolved fields notably local government, exten-sive law functions, health, social work, education, housing, physical planning,the environment, roads and traffic, crofting, most aspects of forestry andmany aspects of transport the Scottish Assembly will pass laws and theScottish Executive will control administration. Organisation and policies inthese fields will be a matter for them. To finance what they want to do theywill have a block grant from United Kingdom taxation which they canallocate as they wish. They will be able, if they choose, to levy a surcharge on local government revenue.171. Scottish Ministers the Secretary of State for Scotland and theLord Advocate will continue to have a major role, as Part V explains. in broad terms however control of the great bulk of public services which affect the people of Scotland will be in the hands of the new Scottishinstitutions.
PART IV: wales.   THE BACKGROUND TO DEVOLUTION IN WALES172. Wales has been politically united with England for much longer than has Scotland, and has been more closely associated in matters of lawand administration. Nevertheless, the distinctive traditions and needs of wales have led to increasing pressure for separate governmental arrange-ments. More and more government work has been moved to Wales, andmore and more bodies set up to deal with Welsh problems. In 1951 theoffice of Minister for Welsh Affairs was created and allocated to the HomeSecretary alongside his other duties; and in 1964 the Government appointed the first Secretary of State for Wales. The work of his department, the welsh Office, now covers such matters as housing and local government,some industrial development functions, town and country planning, high-ways, health, personal social services, and primary and secondary education;and he shares responsibility for agricultural policy and its execution. TheSecretary of State also has a general role of keeping in touch with govern-ment work in Wales that is not his executive responsibility, and representingWales&apos;s interests. This is particularly important in the economic field.173. The presence of the Secretary of State in the Cabinet and welsh office representation on interdepartmental committees has brought great advantages to Wales These advantages must not be lost. The Secretary ofState will carry out many important functions. But a Welsh Assembly is needed to administer a wide range of other major matters, so as to makegovernment in Wales more open and more directly accountable to the welsh people, and to preserve and foster the rich national heritage of the principality.174. Plans for the Welsh Assembly represent a major advance fromthe present position. That position is however not the same as in Scotland.There is no separate legal system and therefore no general problem about dis-tinctive legislation needed for Wales. Moreover, the Governments consul-tations suggest that whereas public opinion in Scotland favours a legislativeassembly, the situation in Wales is different. The desire is for better demo-cratic control over the government already carried out in Wales, particularly by non-elected bodies.175. The Government have therefore decided in favour of a welsh assembly with very substantial policy-making and executive powers andwide responsibility for democratic oversight. The Government believe thatsuch a body will meet the needs and aspirations of the great majority ofthe people of Wales.176. The description of the scheme in the following paragraphs isself-contained. For brevity however where features are essentially the
same as those for Scotland they are generally set out in factual termswithout repetition of all the reasons set out earlier in this White Paper.Cross references are given where appropriate.B. CONSTITUTIONAL arrangements the Welsh Assembly*177. There will be a single-chamber Welsh Assembly, initially with72 members two for each of the 36 Parliamentary constituencies in Wales.At the first election each elector will be able to vote for two candidates,and in each Parliamentary constituency the two with most votes will becomeAssembly Members. For later elections the Boundary Commission for wales will divide Parliamentary constituencies as necessary into single-member Assembly constituencies. Each Parliamentary constituency willbe allotted one, two or three Assembly seats, according to a formula basedon the average size of Parliamentary electorates in Wales. The formulawill be this:  a. Parliamentary constituency whose electorate is     1 Assemblyless than 75% of the average electorate constituencyb. Parliamentary constituency whose electorate is     2 Assemblynot less than 75% and not more than 125% of    constituenciesthe average electoratec. Parliamentary constituency whose electorate is     3 Assemblymore than 125% of the average electorate constituenciesOn present electorates, this system would give an Assembly of about 75members. The formula will be re-applied, and any necessary re-divisionmade, whenever Parliamentary seats are redistributed. The divisions intoAssembly constituencies will be embodied in draft Orders in Council laidbefore Parliament by the Secretary of State.178. Everyone entitled to vote in Parliamentary elections, and alsopeers, will be able to vote in Assembly elections; but no one will have a vote in more than one constituency. The Secretary of State will be respon-sible for general oversight of Assembly elections and for making rules forthem on election expenses and the like.179. The Assembly will be elected for a normal fixed term of fouryears, but the Secretary of State will have power to make minor adjust-ments either way to give a convenient election day.180. The time, place and other arrangements for the first meetingwill be determined by the Secretary of State. Thereafter these matters willbe for the Assembly itself to decide.
181. Matters affecting Assembly membership, such as the rules aboutqualification, disqualification, expulsion and resignation, will be dealt within the Act, as will the special safeguards which Members will need to do their job effectively, such as protection against actions for defamation.Membership of the Assembly will not be barred to Members of the Houseof Commons or the House of Lords. Practical considerations will oftenprevent them from standing for election to the Assembly, but it does not seem right that they should be excluded by statute. Qualification and dis-qualification are dealt with in more detail in Appendix A.182. Every candidate elected to the Assembly will have to swear oraffirm allegiance to the Crown before taking his seat.183. The pay and allowances of Assembly Members will be determinedinitially by the Secretary of State and thereafter by the Assembly itself.184. The Secretary of State will make interim Standing Orders to getthe Assembly started, but thereafter it will make its own, subject to anyrequirements in the Act for example on the use of committees (para-graphs 188-195 below).185. The Assembly will elect from among its members a presidingofficer, like the Speaker in the House of Commons.186. The Secretary of State will not be an ex officio member of theAssembly. But the Assembly and the Secretary of State could arrange byagreement for him to attend and address meetings from time to time.187. The use of the Welsh language in Assembly proceedings and working documents will be for the Assembly itself to decide.Executive Powers and Committees of the Welsh Assembly188. Executive powers in the devolved matters will be vested in theAssembly as a corporate body (and a Crown body). This means that therewill not be a sharp distinction between an Executive sponsoring policies andan Assembly discussing and questioning these policies. Instead all policydiscussion and decision making will rest with the Assembly itself. Most ofits work however will be carried out through standing committees set upto deal with particular devolved subjects, like health and education. TheAssembly&apos;s powers will be exercised (like the Secretary of State&apos;s now) ina variety of ways political or administrative decision, the issuing of cir-circulars, resolutions of the Assembly or committees, and delegated legislation.189. This system, which is well suited to a body which will not have todeal with primary legislation, will allow wide democratic participation inmaking decisions, since all Members will have a positive role. The detailedpattern will to a great extent be for the Assembly itself to decide, but theAct will lay down the general framework.
190. The Act will empower the Assembly to delegate its functions tothe committees. The Assembly will be required to set up committees to coverall the main devolved subjects, and to ensure that representation on thecommittees is broadly based, so as to reflect the political balance in theAssembly.191. Each subject committee will have a chairman, to conduct thebusiness impartially; there will also be a leader (to be known as theExecutive Member), who will take the main initiative on policy and admini-stration and will be the main link with the officials working on the com-mittee&apos;s particular subject. A committee will be able to delegate powersto sub-committees or to the Executive Member.192. The committee chairmen and the Executive Members will beappointed by the Assembly.193. There will be a central co-ordinating committee (to be known asthe Executive Committee) to oversee general policy and the allocation of resources. This will provide a body of manageable size to draw businesstogether, to ensure that cohesive proposals are presented to the assembly and to act for the Assembly as a whole on major issues affecting severalsubjects, including discussion with the Government on the size of the block grant.194. The Executive Committee will comprise all the Executive members from the major subject committees plus any other members (not exceedinga quarter of the total) specially appointed by the Assembly. The assembly will also appoint the chairman, to be known as the Chief Executive. Therewill be no formal limits on the powers of the Executive Committee; but its main purpose will be to settle the allocation of resources between the servicesadministered by the subject committees, and to see that policies are consistent.195. The control of officials and documents will be formally vested inthe Assembly, which will have, as a body, the formal right of full access to departmental papers and officials. However, it would obviously not be consistent with practical government for every Assembly Member to be ableto demand the attendance of any official or insist on seeing any document.The Assembly will therefore be empowered to confer right of access only oncommittees acting in their particular fields of responsibility or, through thosecommittees, on Executive Members or sub-committees similarly acting. Indi-vidual Assembly Members will have no general right of access.Legislation for Wales196. Parliament will continue to legislate for Wales in the devolved sub-jects as well as in others. The Welsh Assembly will therefore work within thelimits of Westminster Acts. But in controlling the devolved services it willtake over whatever powers those Acts confer on central government, includ-ing the power to make delegated legislation.197. This division of responsibility for primary legislation and for execu-tion presents some problems. The formal position is quite clear: the Assembly
will in general be able to do anything in relation to devolved matters that does not require new primary legislation. This means that its powers will vary from service to service, depending on how far primary legislation lays downdetailed requirements. In some subjects Westminster Acts are in fairlygeneral terms, leaving plenty of scope for discretion in day-to-day admini-stration; in others they are drawn more tightly. So the degree of freedomwhich the Assembly will enjoy at the start of its life will to some extent be uneven.198. As the work of the Assembly develops, new factors will come into play. The Assembly will take a close interest in proposed legislation affectingWales. It will debate such documents as White Papers and Green Papersoutlining the Governments plans for legislation. Its officials will be consulted by their Government counterparts as appropriate when new legislation affect-ing devolved matters is being prepared. The Assembly will be able to debateBills as they are published. It will no doubt make representations to theSecretary of State for Wales and to others, such as Welsh Members of Parlia-ment and Government Departments, suggesting how Bills might be improvedto fit Welsh needs. It may sometimes take the initiative itself and press for new Westminster legislation. In time Parliament might wish to give theAssembly greater discretion, by passing legislation which would lay downonly broad guidelines, leaving the Assembly to fill in the rest.199. None of this can be exactly planned. Since Parliament cannot bindits successors, there can be no commitment for the future to alter Bills to suit the Welsh Assembly, to introduce legislation for Wales different fromthat for England, or to implement any concept of &quot;framework&quot; legislation.The pattern must evolve naturally.200. In the passage of private Bills affecting devolved matters in wales the Assembly could be given a role similar to that of a Government Depart-ment. It would then be able to submit reports for the consideration of anyParliamentary Committee enquiring into the provisions of a Private Bill.Delegated Legislation201. In devolved matters the Welsh Assembly will have general respon-sibility for framing and passing delegated legislation under powers conferred by existing or future Acts of Parliament. There may be some exceptions,but they will be few. In general, the Welsh Assembly will deal with all classesof delegated legisation.202. Where an Act applying to a devolved field lays down, in order tocontrol expenditure, that delegated legislation shall be made jointly by twoor more Ministers or with the consent of the Treasury or the Civil service department, the power to make instruments will pass simply to theAssembly. Where an Act confers a power exercisable by Order in Council,that power will become exercisable by Order of the Assembly.203. The general procedures for making and controlling delegated legislation will need some adaptation to the Welsh situation, where there
will not be a separate Assembly and Executive. At present a subordinateinstrument is prepared in the appropriate Department, is made by theMinister or Ministers concerned and undergoes any necessary parliamentary procedure and scrutiny. After devolution all these stages will take place within the Welsh Assembly.204. All delegated legislation which at Westminster would be subject tothe affirmative or negative resolution procedure will require a resolution by the Welsh Assembly in plenary session. Some provision will be needed to enable subject committees to act, and report back later to the fullAssembly, in specially urgent cases. The committees will in any case play an important part in framing statutory instruments and considering their merits.205. Some equivalent is required also to Westminster^ Joint Com-mittee on Statutory Instruments. The Assembly will therefore be requiredto set up, for the general scrutiny of secondary legislation, a committeebroadly representative of the Assembly as a whole and not including anymember of the Executive Committee. The committee will thus be as independent as possible of those primarily responsible for promoting thestatutory instruments which it will examine.206. At present local authorities, certain statutory undertakings likenationalised industries and a few other bodies like the National Trust havea right to petition Parliament against some Orders which affect them. Afterdevolution petitions against Assembly Orders would have to go to theAssembly itself. The Assembly might in theory appear to be acting asjudge in its own cause; but to make Parliament or the Secretary of Statefor Wales the judge would be inconsistent with genuine devolution. What-ever arrangements the Assembly sets up for hearing such petitions will beexpected to provide the greatest possible impartiality.United Kingdom Reserve Powers*207. The Government have no intention of monitoring everything the welsh Assembly does. Nevertheless, the Government must have powerto step in where necessary, either because matters not devolved such asdefence are being prejudiced, or for wider reasons of their ultimate respon-sibility for all the people of the United Kingdom.208. The Government will have open to them three methods of inter-vention, for use either separately or in combination:  a. for actions in prospect, whether involving a proposed subordinateinstrument or some other proposed executive act, they will be ableto issue a direction prohibiting the action or requiring a particular course of action (including the reversal of a previous action), subjectto an affirmative resolution of Parliament within a specified period;
b. for subordinate instruments already made, they will be able tomake an annulment Order following an affirmative resolution ofParliament. In case of urgency the Order can be made without askingParliament first, but subject to affirmative resolution within a specified period;c. for other actions already taken, or for omissions, the Governmentwill be able, if the Welsh Assembly declines to put the matter right,to resume responsibility for the devolved subject in question to theminimum extent necessary for the required place, task or period with power to require and direct the use of the staff and facilities of the Assembly for the purpose. They will do this by Order, subjectto affirmative resolution of Parliament. The powers which theGovernment will be able to take by such an Order will be any powersavailable within statute law applying to Wales, though any require-ment for Assembly approval will be suspended.209. These general procedures for intervening in the business of theAssembly are not intended for frequent use. They will be there in the background as reserve powers; and they permit wider devolution than would otherwise be possible. Their use will require the specific agreementof Parliament.210. All this is about circumstances in which the Government need to intervene on grounds of policy as distinct from law. The legality of theAssembly&apos;s actions will be open to cha&apos;lenge in the courts just like thatof the Government^ own actions.The Civil Service in Wales211. The Welsh Office itself will continue to exercise major functions in Wales, and it will also have an important linking role between theGovernment and the Assembly, particularly in relation to primary legisla-tion. But policymaking and administration in devolved fields now theresponsibility of the Welsh Office will be taken over by the Assembly; andthe Assembly will therefore need substantial numbers of staff.212. The Assembly will be a Crown body. Its officials will thereforebe civil servants. The question arises whether they should form a separateWelsh civil service, or should be part of the United Kingdom civil service.213. The Kilbrandon Commission thought that there would have tobe a separate civil service, on the grounds that a devolved administration would wish to choose its own senior officials, might not be content forgeneral personnel matters to be handled by a Government Department,and would want to be able to rely on the undivided loyalty of their officialsdealing with the Government, for example on the block grant.214. There are however strong arguments for maintaining a unified service. It would help the consultation and co-operation on which thesuccess of devolution will heavily depend. Present experience does not
suggest that with a single service there need be divided loyalty; civilservants by tradition give wholehearted service to whichever Ministers arein charge of their Departments. We cannot assume that all staff will wishto transfer to a service entirely separate from that to which they wererecruited, where the work, conditions and prospects might become sub-stantially different.215. Other factors must be taken into account. A separate service would need more staff (for example to handle personnel matters now dealt withcentrally). A unified service would enable the Assembly to draw its officialsmore easily from a wide pool of talent and experience. The wishes of theAssembly itself will be important, and these cannot be known until it is in being. Finally, even if a separate Welsh service were desirable it could notbe set up in time for the start of the Assembly&apos;s work; it is an option only for the longer term.216. The Government believe that it will be in the best interests ofall to keep a unified United Kingdom civil service. Any change would be amatter for discussion with the Welsh Assembly; staff representatives wouldbe consulted at all stages. It would be essential to maintain the traditionalindependence of the recruitment system.217.  Numbers and costs of staff are dealt with in Part VI.Complaints Machinery218. Complaints against Government Departments can be investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, the &quot;Ombudsman&quot;.Corresponding arrangements for the devolved subjects in Wales will need tobe laid down in the Act. The details are outlined in Appendix B. The basicsystem will remain a matter for Parliament; but the new Welsh commissioner will report to the Assembly.European Community and other International Aspects^219. The Government must remain responsible for all international re-lations, including those concerned with our membership of the european community. There can therefore be no question of seeking for the welsh assembly any right of formal access to Community or other international bodies. Nevertheless, both in Community and in other contexts inter-national business touches increasingly on matters which will be devolved tothe Assembly. The views of the Assembly must be taken into account.Arrangements will therefore be developed for consultation between Mem-bers and officials of the Assembly and the Government. These might operatemost effectively through the Secretary of State for Wales and through theparticular Ministers representing the United Kingdom in Brussels or else-where.220. It is necessary to ensure that any relevant international obligationsare properly observed in the devolved fields in Wales. Breach of international
obligation will be avoided in the normal way through the close consultationwhich the Government intend to maintain with the Welsh Assembly. If,exceptionally, this does not work for any reason, and the Assembly takessome action contrary to the United Kingdom&apos;s international obligations, theGovernment will be able to use their reserve powers for dealing with mattersunacceptable on policy grounds. These powers have been explained in para-graph 208 above. The use of reserve powers in these cases will not howeverrequire the approval of Parliament.221. Positive action is sometimes needed to fulfil new European Com-munity or other obligations. The Government will keep formal responsibilityfor all matters relating to international obligations, even when these mattersarise in fields otherwise devolved; but the Government will be able at their discretion to delegate to the Welsh Assembly, by Order, the job of taking any necessary action (other than primary legislation) to implement the obli-gation. The power will be a flexible one, which can be used to delegateaction either on a particular item, such as an individual European Com-munity directive, or on a general area of business. The Government envisagethat in practice it might well become the normal course to delegate imple-mentation by agreement to the Assembly. The devolution Act will add theAssembly to the category of those who can be designated as implementingauthorities under the European Communities Act 1972.C.  FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS*222. Paragraphs 94-100 above explain the basic concepts for the finan-cial arrangements underpinning devolution. These concepts are the samefor Wales as for Scotland. Paragraphs 223-232 below set out their detailed application to Wales.The Block Grant223. Central governmental finance for the devolved services will beprovided essentially by block grant voted by Parliament. The Assembly willhave the fullest possible freedom to decide how the money should be spent how much, for example, should go on roads, houses, schools and hospitals,and where in Wales it should be spent. This is a major economic as well associal power, and will give the Assembly a powerful new instrument forshaping developments over a wide range of services. In 1974-75 public expenditure on the services proposed for devolution was more than  850million with a further sum of  60 million met by local authorities as loan charges. Had the proposed financial arrangements been in operation thiswould have involved a block grant of about  650 million, local authoritytaxation of  90 million and borrowing of more than  150 million. Expen-diture on the devolved services would have come to more than half of totalidentifiable public expenditure in Wales.
224. The Governments decision on the total amount for all the devolved services will not be a matter of simply imposing an arbitrary figure; it willbe the outcome of a close and thorough process of discussion each year with the Assembly. Appendix C outlines how this might run in a typicalyear.225. The Assembly will base its proposals on its view of Welsh needs inthe devolved fields. But the Government must take account also of otherneeds, both elsewhere in the United Kingdom and in non-devolved fieldswithin Wales. All these needs must then be related to what the UnitedKingdom can afford for public expenditure against other claims, includingthe balance of payments, private investment and private consumption, aswell as the needs of public industries such as coal and steel which willcontinue to be very important to Wales.226. With understanding on both sides agreement should usually bereached on a total accepted as fair both to Wales and to the rest of theUnited Kingdom. If agreement is not reached the matter will have to besettled by the Government, answerable to Parliament. Parliament, withits Welsh Members alongside those from all other parts of the UnitedKingdom, will vote the amount for the devolved services, and settle thestatutory limits on the Assembly&apos;s short-term borrowing and on issues tothe Welsh Loans Fund.Taxation227. Welsh taxpayers will continue to pay United Kingdom taxes at united Kingdom rates, and these payments will contribute to the centralpool of national resources from which the block grant and other national expenditure will be financed according to needs.228. Local authorities, who will run many of the devolved services,can settle their own levels of taxation, so that there will be some flexibility in the total amount available for the services in Wales. The assembly will decide both how much of the block grant should be distributed tolocal government and how to allocate it among individual authorities. in calculating the block grant the Government will in general assume thatWelsh local authorities will receive, in relation to their expenditure needs and their taxable resources, provision comparable with that for localauthorities in England; whether they in fact levy more or less local tax,and are assigned more or less subsidy from the block grant, will be amatter to be settled in Wales.229. The Assembly will have an optional power to make a surcharge on local authority taxation; but it will not have to use this unless it runsinto deficit or deliberately aims for a higher level of expenditure, forexample to meet some particular Welsh priority for which it judges people would be willing to accept higher burdens.
Other Sources of Finance230. Capital expenditure by local authorities and by other public bodies in devolved fields will continue to be financed by borrowing. Localauthorities will continue to have access to the Public Works Loan Board.Other public bodies will have access to a new Welsh Loans Fund forlonger-term borrowing, financed from the National Loans Fund and controlled by the Assembly. The main condition on its use will be that on-lending should not be at a lower rate of interest than the correspondingloan from the National Loans Fund. The only long-term borrowing trans-actions controlled individually by the Government will be those involvingforeign currency or overseas sources. However, the Government will alsocontrol both the total amount of long-term borrowing and, within this,the total of borrowing from official sources by local authorities and public corporations.Financial Control and Audit231. The Act will lay down certain basic features to ensure that thereis a sound system for authorising expenditure and reporting on the accounts.In addition to the Welsh Loans Fund, there will be Welsh counterparts ofthe Consolidated Fund, the Comptroller and Auditor General and thePublic Accounts Committee (whose membership will be substantiallyseparate from that of the Executive Committee). The Assembly will havepower to appropriate funds to individual services by Assembly Order,corresponding to Appropriation Acts at Westminster.232. Responsibility for controlling issues from the Welsh Funds andfor supervising the arrangements for monitoring and audit will rest squarelywith Welsh bodies. Reports by the Welsh Comptroller and Auditor general will go to the Assembly and will be considered by the Welsh accounts committee. It will be for the Assembly to decide what action should betaken on the Committee&apos;s reports. The Act will however require thepublication of these reports, so that expenditure on devolved matters under-goes the same public scrutiny as the corresponding expenditure does now.D.   THE DEVOLVED SUBJECTS233. Within the fields to be devolved to the Assembly, and subject only to the framework established by Acts of Parliament,. the welsh assembly will have full policy-making and executive powers of the kindnow vested in Ministers. Provided that their actions are not inconsistent with the statutory framework, they will be able to develop their owndistinctive policies and approaches, and to develop new tasks if they wish.234. This is a concept of wide authority and freedom, and it will beapplied to a great range of subjects, as paragraphs 236-273 explain.Appendix D gives a tabular summary.235. The responsibilities to be transferred on devolution in the variousfields will be those which the Government now carry. The proposals do notentail any removal of current tasks or powers from local government.
Local Government236. Responsibility for central government supervision of most aspectsof local government in Wales will be devolved. The administration willoversee the work of local authorities in devolved matters. It will allocaterate support grant to them, control their capital investment in the devolvedfields and be responsible for the application of the local taxation system.The devolution Act will make no change in the structure of local govern-ment in Wales.237. Local government administrative and electoral areas andboundaries will remain the responsibility of the Secretary of State, advised by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Wales. The assembly will not of course be responsible for any functions which Welsh localauthorities continue to carry out in matters not devolved; the responsibilities of central and local government in these matters will remain unchanged.Health*238. The Assembly will be responsible for health matters in Wales,including the National Health Service. It will be free to settle arrangements and priorities for the provision of health care, including the resources to be allocated, and to develop its own policies on such matters as family planning,private practice and the control of nursing homes. In this as in other fields(see paragraph 267 below) certain general United Kingdom standards will however continue to apply for example in relation to medicines and drugs.Personal Social Services!239. The Assembly will be responsible for such social services as the care of children, the elderly, the handicapped and others in need of special care and protection. It will be able to supervise private provision in these fields, and make grants to voluntary bodies. It will not however beresponsible for the probation service.Social Security:;:240. The social security system and the war pensions scheme will remain on a United Kingdom basis.241. Some problems arise over schemes for rent and rate rebates, rentallowances, and the minimum charges and personal allowances for thoseliving in local authority homes. The Governments approval will be requiredfor any changes in such schemes which would affect wholly or mainly peoplereceiving supplementary benefits, or people who would receive them if the changes were made. It is a more open question whether, because of the complexity of the interaction with social security generally, it would bebetter not to devolve powers relating to such schemes at all. The Govern-ment would welcome comments from bodies working in this field.
Education, Science and the Arts*242. The Assembly will be responsible for all educational and culturalmatters (including the welfare of the Welsh language) other than those noted in paragraph 243 below. It will control the schook system in Wales, and itwill be able to determine the structure of the maintained sector and policyof private schools and nursery education. It will be responsible for youthand community services, and for all further and higher education except the universities. However, since England and Wales operate virtually as a unit in the supply of teachers, the Assembly will be required to conform with guidance from the Government on the total output of teachers in Wales.243. Responsibility will not be devolved for the Research Councils orthe Nature Conservancy Council; for the universities; for national policy onmandatory awards to students on higher education courses (though theAssembly will be responsible for policy on discretionary awards); and for post-graduate awards.244. The Assembly will be responsible for the arts (except the export control of works of art) and for national and local libraries, museums and galleries.Housingt245. The Assembly will be responsible for all aspects of housing, exceptthat the Government will remain responsible for housing finance in theprivate sector (building society mortgages and the like) and will also keep a reserve power to prevent or restrict increases in public and private sectorrents where general economic and counter-inflationary policy makes this necessary. These limited qualifications apart, the Assembly will be able tohave its own policies, for both the public and the private sectors, on theprovision and upkeep of accommodation, the control of rents, subsidies tolocal authorities and housing associations, renovation, building standards and slum clearance.Physical Planning and the Environment?:246. The Assembly will be generally responsible for physical planning and the environment. It will deal with the various aspects of land use how to manage its development and control, how to co-ordinate land use planningwith (for example) transport planning, and how to provide the generalinfrastructure needed for the prosperity of Wales. It will deal with thegeneral improvement of the environment; the rehabilitation of derelictland; new towns; and the protection of countryside amenity and landscape.
247. The Assembly will have substantial supervisory powers under thenew community land legislation, and will appoint the members of the LandAuthority for Wales.248. The devolution of planning powers will be subject to a continuingright which should not need to be used often for the Government to&quot;call in&quot; any particular planning issue for their decision if the generalUnited Kingdom interest is affected, for example on non-devolved matterslike defence. The Government will probably also need to keep the right tosettle any disputes over compulsory purchase affecting such matters.249. The Assembly will be responsible for sport and recreation, parks and open spaces, national parks, ancient monuments and historic buildings,public and civic amenities, and a variety of other matters like refusecollection and disposal, cemeteries, markets, fairs and allotments. It will beresponsible also for dealing with natural emergencies (though any use of the armed forces to help in these must remain a matter for the Government).It will be responsible for protecting the environment, including preventingnuisances, atmospheric pollution and noise, except that their powers willnot extend to aircraft, motor vehicles and ships.Roads and Transport4250. The Assembly will be responsible for a wide range of matters inthe transport field. These will include the planning, construction and standards of roads; the application of traffic rules (except on motorways,where uniformity throughout Great Britain is important for safety); bilingualroad signs; road safety publicity; local transport planning; road servicelicensing, including appointing Traffic Commissioners and deciding appealsarising from their decisions; powers to subsidise bus and railway passenger services, to be exercised concurrently with similar local authority powers;inland waterways; examining and paying claims for new bus grants; operat-ing the current powers to pay fuel duty rebate to bus operators; and the supervision of local authority airports.Development and Industry-;-251. There will be no change in the powers of the Welsh DevelopmentAgency. Its environmental and factory building functions will be fullydevolved, except that the terms of disposal of factories will remain under government control. The other industrial functions of the Agency willremain with the Government. Half the members of the Board of the Agencywill be appointed by the Assembly, which will also be consulted before theSecretary of State appoints the Chairman.252. There can be no question of breaking up the main nationalised industries or splitting responsibility for them. The Government envisage
however that there should be informal contacts between them and theAssembly on matters of joint interest, and that they should include in their reports information on recent developments and future plans for Wales.The Assembly will be able to discuss these reports, and to make representa-tions to the industries or to Ministers.253. Government Departments operating on a central basis will keep their present statutory functions for industry and commerce; but they will consult the Office of the Secretary of State or the Assembly on matters ofcommon concern.Natural Resources*254. The Assembly will be responsible for freshwater fisheries, formanagement of the agricultural estates now vested in the Secretary ofState for Wales, and also for forestry functions (except fiscal, regulatoryand international aspects). The Forestry Commission will remain as the instrument for carrying out Welsh policies, for which it will be financed byand accountable to the Assembly.Water in Wales255. Decisions taken about water services in Wales can radically affectwater supplies in extensive and heavily populated areas of England. In orderto match river basins the area of the Welsh National Water development authority has to include parts of England and that of the Severn-TrentRegional Water Authority to include parts of Wales. The Governmentenvisage that both authorities should remain in being within their presentboundaries and should be responsible to the Welsh Assembly for their operations in Wales and to the Government for their operations in England.Substantial water development and policy changes anywhere in Wales willbe subject to the Assembly&apos;s agreement. Unresolved cross-border disputeswould have to be referred to the Government. The Assembly will provideor nominate the majority of the members of the WNWDA and some members of the STRWA, and will be responsible for water recreation andamenity planning throughout Wales.256. The Government are currently conducting a general review ofthe water industry in England and Wales. The details of the arrangements described above may need to be altered in the light of that review.Tourism257. The Assembly will be responsible for tourism in Wales, includingthe Wales Tourist Board. Overseas promotion will remain the responsibilityof the British Tourist Authority, which will receive funds from the Govern-ment for promoting tourism to Wales as well as to England and Scotland.If the Assembly wants to give the Authority extra funds for specific
promotions overseas, or to give work to other agencies, it will be free to doso; but it will not receive extra United Kingdom funds for these purposes.Other Matters258. The Assembly will be responsible also (to the extent that there are current governmental functions conferred by primary legislation) for a wide variety of other matters such as fire services; betting, gaming andlotteries; public holidays and summer time; the registration of theatricalemployers; controlling charitable collections; Sunday observance; shophours; the registration of births, marriages and deaths; and the licensing oftaxis, liquor and places of entertainment.259. It will not be possible to decide whether the Assembly shouldhave a role in relation to broadcasting until the Committee on the Futureof Broadcasting, under the chairmanship of Lord Annan, has reported.Technical factors and international obligations will in any event make itimpossible to devolve responsibility for allocating frequencies and control-ling transmitter power.Nominated Bodies260. The Government attach particular importance to giving theAssembly the maximum role possible in the democratic supervision ofnominated bodies now operating in the fields to be devolved. The following paragraphs set out the arrangements which the Government propose forthe future treatment of existing bodies.261. The Assembly will be responsible for nominated bodies operatingwholly in Wales on devolved matters unless, exceptionally, it provesnecessary in a particular case to set special limitations. This responsibilitywill include financing, accountability, reporting and appointments (thoughrecommendations for appointments by the Crown will need to be made through the Secretary of State). The Assembly will inherit all governmentalpowers under existing legislation affecting those bodies. If changes are needed in bodies constituted by Royal Charter or Warrant, these bodieswill themselves have to apply for the necessary amendments to theirconstitutions.262. The Government intend that the Secretary of State should havepower, by Order subject to negative resolution procedure at Westminster,to provide that the Welsh Assembly itself should assume the functions of aparticular nominated body in Wales. This power would be used in consulta-tion with the Assembly.263. Bodies operating in Wales in devolved matters but organised on a United Kingdom, Great Britain or England-and-Wales basis raisecomplicated problems. The Government at present envisage that these bodies will continue initially to operate as they do now; they will have no formal accountability to the Assembly and, where they are financed nowthrough Parliament, this will continue. However, by normal consultation
and agreement the Government will be able to secure changes in their activities and membership, and executive bodies will be able to act as the agents of the Assembly, provided all this can be arranged within the broadscope of the body&apos;s general policy, its legal powers and, where appropriate,its continuing primary responsibility to the Government. There will alsobe provision for the Government, by Order subject to affirmative resolution of Parliament, to make any legal changes which may be needed in the formal structure and powers of a particular body to reflect any agreementbetween them and the Assembly in consultation with the body itself.264. The staff of a nominated body operating wholly in Wales in adevolved field who are civil servants will be treated on devolution like other civil servants in the devolved fields; they will continue to belong to a unifiedUnited Kingdom service. Any consultations between the administration andthe Government about setting up a separate Welsh civil service (paragraph216 above) would include the future of civil servants serving with nominatedbodies. The assembly will inherit whatever responsibilities the Govern-ment now have in relation to staff who are not civil servants.265. With nominated bodies operating on a United Kingdom or GreatBritain basis (paragraph 263), there will be no change in responsibility forstaff.266. Appendix F lists nominated bodies to which the arrangements inparagraphs 261-265 are expected to apply.General Standards*267. There are a number of matters in which common rules and standards are essential and for which responsibility must therefore remain with the Government. These cover the regulation or statutory standards of marketing, composition, labelling and performance of commonly tradedarticles or goods, including in particular food (and its handling), medicines,drugs, animal feedingstuffs and pesticides; construction standards forvehicles; and safety standards for fuel-burning appliances, for the use of gas, and for articles used in the home such as inflammable textiles. they also include trades unions, industrial relations and the rights of employees;export credit; competition policy; fair trading; insurance; patents, trademarks, designs and copyright; weights and measures; and shipping and civilaviation.Pay in the Public Sectorf268. The Assembly will be required to take account, in determiningpay and related conditions (including pensions) in the devolved services, ofany wider considerations of national economic or pay policy broughtspecially to their attention by the Government. In addition, in fields wherethe Government now exercise, in one way or another, general control
over pay and conditions of service (as in the health service) the consentof the Secretary of State will be required for any changes. Moreover, theGovernment expect that where pay in any area of the public services isnow settled by national negotiations or arrangements, these will continue with appropriate representation for the Welsh Assembly after devolution-tion, whether or not the Secretary of State&apos;s consent is required to the outcome.Statistics and Other Information41269. The right to collect relevant statistics and other information goesnaturally with responsibility for particular services, and the Assembly willhave this right in the devolved fields.270. The population census for England and Wales must remain basic-ally a matter for the Government. The Government would however take into account any views of the Assembly in determining the scope and con-tent of census-taking in Wales.271. To ensure that the Government remain able to meet theirretained responsibilities there will be a general provision in the Act requir-ing the Assembly to furnish information to the Government on request.272. The Assembly and the Government will be bound to safeguardeach other&apos;s confidential information, and the law on the protection of official information will apply in devolved matters as it does now in Govern-ment matters.Tribunals and Inquiries&apos;)&apos;273. Within devolved fields, the Assembly will inherit any existing powers concerning tribunals and inquiries, and will be able to set up non-statutory inquiries.E.   SUMMARY OF THE SCHEME FOR WALES274. The scheme will create an elected Welsh Assembly. While theAssembly will not be able to pass primary legislation, there will be a majordevolution of policy-making and executive powers covering a great range of subjects now controlled by the Government. The devolved matters for wales will become the responsibility of the Assembly, working throughspecialised committees in which all members can take a constructive part.275. Mainly through the Secretary of State, the Assembly will be ableto influence the shaping of United Kingdom legislation that applies to wales in the devolved fields; and Welsh Members of Parliament will take part in its scrutiny and passage. Within primary legislation, and subject to
a limited number of specific restrictions and to general constitutional safe-guards, the use of which should in practice be exceptional, the assembly will have wide freedom. These fields will include most aspects of super-vising local government, health, social services, education, housing, physicalplanning, the environment and forestry and many aspects of transport and water. In these devolved fields the Assembly will be able in general to do anything that does not need new primary legislation. To finance the devolved services it will have a block grant from United Kingdom taxation, which itcan allocate as it wishes. It will be able, if it chooses, to levy a surcharge on local government taxation.276. The general effect will be to place under immediate Welsh demo-cratic supervision a wide range of services run in Wales for Wales. Thiswill include bringing under the Assembly&apos;s control many of the appointedbodies now operating in Wales.277. The Secretary of State will continue to have a major role, asPart V explains. In broad terms however control of the great bulk ofpublic services which affect the people of Wales will be in the hands oftheir Assembly.
PART V: DECENTRALISATION-THE EXECUTIVE ROLE of scottish AND WELSH MINISTERS IN THE GOVERNMENT278. Parts III and IV above have set out the subject fields to be devolved to the Scottish and Welsh administrations. All other matters willbe reserved to the Government. The Government have however reviewed the full range of these other matters, and intend to allocate important newresponsibilities to the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales.279. Decentralisation is not a substitute for devolution. But where itis necessary for powers to remain with the Government, decentralisationenables decision taking within the framework of collective ministerial responsibility to be moved to Scotland and Wales. It will also make it possible to have simpler and more effective arrangements for informalconsultation with the devolved administrations on matters of common concern.280. Some of the powers which cannot be devolved are already exer-cised by the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. The Secretary ofState for Scotland will remain responsible for the electricity industry. Hewill also keep the main agriculture and fisheries functions. These are essen-tial national industries, and to avoid market distortions policies must bedetermined by the Government. There are also important international and European Community aspects. Devolution is therefore impracticable.Where powers are at present exercised in Scotland by the Secretary ofState, but for Wales by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food(sometimes jointly with the Secretary of State), those for Wales will betransferred to the Secretary of State alone.281. The Secretaries of State will keep their responsibilities for economic planning and industrial steering and promotion, as well as powers of selec-tive regional industrial assistance under section 7 of the Industry Act1972, where they will be able at their discretion to arrange for the scottish and Welsh Development Agencies to act for them. They will also keep their powers of control over the investment and industrial participationactivities of the Development Agencies, though all the other powers of the agencies will be under the direct control of the Scottish and Welsh admini-strations. The combination of devolved and reserved functions in the agencies is reflected by the arrangement whereby the Secretaries of state will appoint half the members of the Boards, and will also appoint the chairmen after consultation with the administrations. Responsibility forthe Highlands and Islands Development Board&apos;s activities as a whole willbe devolved, but the Board&apos;s geographical area will continue to be defined by the Secretary of State for Scotland and he will lay down a system ofguidelines and cash limits for their activities in non-devolved fields suchas assistance to industry, fishing and agriculture.
282. The main new function which will be transferred both to theSecretary of State for Scotland and to the Secretary of State for wales will be responsibility for the activities in Scotland and Wales of the Man-power Services Commission, the Training Services Agency and the Employ-ment Service Agency. Within the requirements of a single labour marketthis transfer will help these bodies to give full emphasis to special localconditions. The Government intend to develop with the Scottish and welsh administrations informal arrangements for co-ordination between these activities and related ones for which the administrations will beresponsible, including further education.283. The Government have considered decentralising to the Secre-taries of State for Scotland and Wales responsibility for some or all ofthe activities in Scotland and Wales of those nationalised industries whichcannot be devolved. These include industries which form part of a closelyintegrated national and in some cases international network (railways,airways, posts and telecommunications) and others (steel, coal, gas) whichserve wide markets and must for efficiency continue to be run on a UnitedKingdom or Great Britain basis. In these cases (and also with ports, forwhich the Government will soon be bringing forward nationalisation pro-posals) transfer to the Secretaries of State of formal responsibilities for ageographical part of the operations would make little sense. The secretaries of State already share however in Government decisions affecting these industries (including appointments to their associated consumer bodies)in Scotland and Wales, and the importance of this involvement will be enhanced by their new economic functions.284. Since the Government bear the prime responsibility for protect-ing the interests of all citizens of the United Kingdom and the securityof the nation there are other functions outside the economic field wheredevolution is not feasible; certain law and functions in Scotland such asthose relating to the police and the prosecution system are notable ex-amples. Most of these will however continue to be exercised by ScottishMinisters the Secretary of State or the Lord Advocate.285. Taken together, the decentralisation proposals will give the secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales an enhanced and very sub-stantial economic role, monitored by Parliament with its full complementof Scottish and Welsh Members. The Secretaries of State and the lord advocate will also retain a wide general role, even in matters where ithas not been necessary to create formal arrangements, in advising their colleagues in the Government on particular Scottish and Welsh considera-tions. All this will complement the devolution schemes in ensuring that decisions on a very wide range of Government activity are made in Scot-land and Wales, whether by the devolved administrations or by scottish and Welsh Ministers, and that decisions which have to be made elsewheretake full account of the Scottish and Welsh dimension.
PART VI: COSTS286. The long-term cost of devolution in manpower and money can-not be calculated exactly. No one can forecast how successful the newadministrations will be in providing devolved services economically, or what changes they may choose to make in the organisation and conduct ofbusiness. Estimates made now can be based only upon a broad assessment of how the devolved administrations, and the Scottish and Welsh offices in their new form, are likely to operate when they are first established.Furthermore, the main policy decisions are still recent; there must be con-tinued study of detail, some of which could have cost implications.287. Devolution must mean some increase in the direct costs of gov-ernment. There will be entirely new activities, not least the running ofthe Assemblies themselves; there will be some loss of economies of scale in support services; there will be new and sometimes unavoidably complexdivisions of responsibility; and it must be likely that in some of the devolved fields the new administrations will wish to make less use thanthe Scottish and Welsh Offices do of the specialised expertise of London-based Departments.288. It would however be quite wrong to suppose that devolutionmeans vast new bureaucracies. In essence, it is not the creation of newadministrative machines but the transfer of responsibility for existing onesto new centres of democratic accountability.289. On provisional estimates made so far, the scheme for Scotlandmight mean a capital outlay of some  2-3 million (for the conversion ofthe former Royal High School building in Edinburgh to house the Assem-bly), extra staff of about 1,000 (including 200 for the Assembly itself)and extra annual running costs of around  10 million.290. The picture is different in Wales, since there has been less decent-tralisation; the Welsh Office is far smaller than the Scottish Office. the extra requirement in Wales is therefore both larger (because extra func-tions will be transferred to the Principality) and more difficult to estimateclosely. Broadly however the extra staff might be around 600 initially,rising thereafter to about 1,600 when the Assembly gets into its stride. Atthe earlier level the extra running costs would be around  5 million, risingat the later stage to around  12 million. Preparing the Temple of peace and Health in Cardiff (if it can be made available) for the Assembly might mean a capital outlay of  1-2 million.291. The transfer of responsibilities to the new administrations will affect the tasks of other Government Departments as well as the scottish and Welsh Offices. It is not yet possible to estimate all the effects, even
broadly, but there ought to be net savings in these other Departments, par-ticularly in relation to Wales.292. These last effects apart, the schemes for Scotland and Wales to-gether might mean, in total, capital costs of around  4 million, extra staffbuilding up to some 2,500-3,000 and annual costs building up to around  22million. Such costs are naturally in themselves unwelcome, especially incurrent economic circumstances. They must however be seen in perspective;they relate to a major gain in democratic control and accountability for public services which last year cost nearly  2,900 million. Against this back-ground, the Government do not regard them as disproportionately heavy.
PAGE VII: WHAT SCOTTISH AND WELSH DEVOLUTION will mean FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM293. The Governments proposals for Scotland and Wales envisagepowerful and wide-ranging new systems of democratic control to meet thedesire of the Scottish and Welsh people for more direct and effective in-volvement in the running of their own affairs, recognising their distinctiveidentities within the wider framework of which they will remain part. Theproposals however will rightly evoke interest not in those countries alone,but throughout the United Kingdom. The Government will therefore wel-come wide discussion and comment. The essential political and economic unity of the United Kingdom has the corollary that what happens to thepart must be of concern to the whole. It is to the benefit of all our citizens,wherever they live, that that unity should be preserved; the Governmenthave taken this as a constant and cardinal principle in devising their pro-posals. Irrespective of any later plans for England or Northern Ireland,devolution must never be seen as conferring unfair advantages on Scotlandand Wales.294. The Government look forward to public debate on their proposals.These proposals are designed to strike a careful balance in particular,between the desirability of allowing the maximum local freedom and initiative-tive and the need to safeguard the unity of the United Kingdom; and be-tween maximising local democratic control over the allocation of expen-diture on the public services and the continuing responsibility of theGovernment for managing the economy. Any suggestions for modifying the proposals will also have to pay regard to these considerations if theyare to command widespread acceptance.295. After devolution to Scotland and Wales, each part of the UnitedKingdom will have a different form of government. There is nothing newabout this. Northern Ireland had a separate Parliament from 1920 to 1973,and more recently its own Assembly. Scotland has had its own minister in the Government for very many years, and a wide range of powers and functions have been decentralised to him. The system in Wales is similar in principle, but newer and less extensive. Arrangements in the english regions are different again, with regional offices of central governmentbacked up by advisory bodies such as the regional economic planning councils.296. The unity and coherence of British society will not be destroyed.Changes in our democratic machinery will not harm the deep sense of allegiance to the United Kingdom as a whole felt by our peoples; indeed,their success depends upon it. Nothing in the Governments present pro-posals will weaken the powerful social and cultural influences which help to build unity highly developed communications; widely-circulating news-
papers; radio and television; and above all a close web of ties in family andfriendship throughout the United Kingdom. The peoples of Scotland andWales will find it welcome that, within a larger unitary state, they willhave their own Assemblies, concerned to foster their culture and traditionsand to satisfy their needs in the ways they wish. The United kingdom will still be a single state; the Scottish and Welsh administrations will haveno separate authority in international relations. Parliament will remainultimately sovereign in all matters, whether devolved or not, and will con-tinue to include the present complement of Scottish and Welsh Members.297. The United Kingdom economy will continue to be managed as one unit, with all contributing through the tax system according to theirmeans and for the benefit of all. It is not the purpose of devolution to giveScotland and Wales more and more while the rest of the United Kingdomgets less and less. The object is rather to give Scotland and Wales morefreedom to decide what to do with their fair share a discretion to improve the use rather than to raise the consumption of resources. The economic position of a country or region will not depend on the tax revenue whichit happens to produce at a particular period; vigorous regional policieswill continue, with the aim of achieving the fairest possible division of jobs and investment between different areas of the United Kingdom. Andthe Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales, alive to the traditionsand needs of their countries and charged with both constitutional andeconomic functions, will help to ensure that relations between the Govern-ment and the new administrations are marked by creative co-operation.298. Any change in the machinery of democratic government mustbring new problems in its wake. The Scottish and Welsh Assemblies will no doubt have teething troubles, and there will be a financial price topay. This however is well worth accepting in order to meet the clearpopular demand in Scotland and Wales for bringing nearer home the democratic control of much government activity. The proposals set outin this White Paper are a response to differing needs in the ways best matchedto them. This flexibility will give renewed vigour and strength to our unity.
SCOTTISH AND WELSH ASSEMBLIES:QUALIFICATION AND DISQUALIFICATION FOR MEMBERSHIP1. The rules on qualification and disqualification for membership ofthe Assemblies will be the same for both Scotland and Wales.Qualification for Membership2.   Candidates should be (as for the House of Commons): -a. at least 21 years of age; and b. a British subject or a citizen of the Republic of Ireland.Disqualification for Membership3.   The following persons will be disqualified:  a. persons who are disqualified for House of Commons member-ship as holding any of the offices set out in section 1 of theHouse of Commons Disqualification Act 1975, such as judges,civil servants, and members of police forces or of the regulararmed services;b. persons holding certain other listed offices, including chairman-ship or membership of a wide range of commisions, boards,administrative tribunals, public authorities and undertakings.The general criteria for drawing up the list are described inparagraph 4;c. persons under sentence of treason;d. persons whose estate has been sequestrated or who have beenadjudged bankrupt; ande. persons who are guilty of corrupt or illegal practices at electionsunder Part III of the Representation of the People Act 1949,which will be applied to the Assemblies.4. The general criteria for drawing up the list of disqualifying officesmentioned in paragraph b. above will be these: -a. paid office holders whose functions are confined to scotland or Wales and who will in future be appointed by the Scottishor Welsh administrations will normally be disqualified from theAssembly of the country in which they perform their functions and generally also from the House of Commons, but not fromthe other Assembly;b. persons who hold paid office in bodies appointed by the UnitedKingdom Government and who are disqualified from the Houseof Commons will normally be disqualified from the Scottish orWelsh Assembly if the functions of the body extend to scotland or Wales respectively, but not otherwise;c. unpaid office holders will be disqualified only if the office might make it impossible for its holder to fulfil his Assembly dutysatisfactorily or if it is particularly important that the holder of
the particular office concerned should be seen to be free from political bias. Where disqualification is regarded as appropriate for these reasons, its territorial application will follow that forpaid offices.5. Members of the United Kingdom Parliament, including peers andpeeresses, will not be disqualified. Nor will a member of one Assembly be disqualified from membership of another.6. No clergy of any denomination will be disqualified from the Assem-blies.7. The proposed rules on disqualification are in substance the sameas those for the House of Commons, except in respect of clergy and peers.Alterations to the Scope of Disqualification8. There will be two ways of altering the lists of disqualifying offices.One will be primary legislation by Parliament, for example when newpublic offices are established whose functions extend to Scotland or Wales.The other will be by Order in Council. It will be open to the Assembliesto resolve that the list should be altered, for example in consequence ofa new Scottish Assembly Act; and the Government would take note ofany such resolution.Exclusion and Expulsion of Members from the Assemblies9. An Assembly will be able to exclude for a limited period members who are obstructing business to an intolerable extent. This will be done under the Assembly&apos;s own Standing Orders, as part of the day-to-day con-duct of business. In addition, the Act will lay down that failure to attend meetings of the Assembly or its committees for any period of six consecutive-tive months will result in the Member&apos;s seat becoming vacant, unless theabsence is specifically approved by the Assembly.Repercussions on Membership of the House of Commons10. Members of the Assemblies will not be disqualified for member-ship of the House of Commons. But some office holders under the Assemblieswill need to be added to the list of those disqualified from the House ofCommons.
COMPLAINTS MACHINERY IN SCOTLAND AND wales. The existing complaints machinery (the &quot;Ombudsman&quot; system) is animportant protection for the citizen, and the Government will establishcomparable machinery to investigate complaints of maladministration bythe Scottish and Welsh administrations in the devolved fields.2. Scottish and Welsh Assembly Commissioners will be appointed by her Majesty. Action will be initiated by a complaint to an Assembly Memberwhich will then be passed to the Commissioner; in Wales, where the Assem-bly will be the executive and can itself be the body complained against,there will be additional provision for the Commissioner to accept a com-plaint direct from the public where an Assembly Member has declined topass it on.3. Subject to exclusions comparable to those applying to the Parliamen-tary Commissioner, the Scottish Assembly Commissioner will be able to investigate any action taken in the exercise of administrative functions by a department serving the Scottish Executive. The Welsh AssemblyCommissioner will have a similar power in relation to action taken by oron behalf of the Welsh Assembly by Members, committees, or officers.4. The Commissioners will make periodic general reports to the Assem-blies. They will also be able to make special reports, for example on caseswhere the injustice has not been or will not be remedied.5. The investigation of complaints about the activities of the scottish and Welsh Offices and other Government Departments will remain theresponsibility of the Parliamentary Commissioner.6. Where a Government Department or one of the devolved adminis-trations is acting as agent for the other, or where a complaint covers bothdevolved and non-devolved matters, the Government Departments actionswill be investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner and the adminis-tration&apos;s actions by the appropriate Assembly Commissioner.7. The complaints machinery for the health service in Scotland andWales will continue, but with procedural modifications so that the Com-missioners report to the devolved administrations. The complaints machineryfor local government in Scotland and Wales will continue as at present.8. Legislative responsibility for all these Commissioners will remain with Parliament. In the longer term, when the Government and the devolved administrations have had some experience of operating afterdevolution, there may be scope for them, in collaboration, to considerstreamlining the present system.
