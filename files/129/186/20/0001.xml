1MB conclusions the general view was that those arrangements did not offerprospects for viability in accordance with the criteriaagainst which the Board were charged to view proposals.Some members considered that, whilst recognising the acutesocial consequences, the lack of viability coupled with the potential adverse implications for the rest of the motor industry would not warrant a recommendation to provide assistance, though every effort should be madeto mitigate the effects on employment.The clear majority felt that the social, industrial and balance of payments considerations were sufficiently seriousto offset the lack of viability, and that assistance   wouldbe warranted, but subject to the following preconditionsvoiced by several members:-(i) A greater financial contribution on capital account should be made by the Chrysler Corporation asearnest of their commitment;(ii) A sanction for the Government against the chrysler corporation, as majority shareholders in Chrysler UKeg the right to place Chrysler UK into receivership,should be negotiated to enable the Government to curtail its commitment or vary the arrangements in   ,the light of events;
(iii)   Related to (ii) a binding and enforceable arrange-ment being accepted by the workforce, involvingactual sacrifice by them, at least to ensure amarked and continuing improvement in production costs, productivity, manning levels and otherkey factors in determining competitiveness; inthe view of certain members these arrangements should involve a contribution from wages.It was also recognised as desirable, if assistance were provided,(i) At least to take the fullest advantage before a decision is announced to capture the initiative in relation to the workforce;(ii) to obtain a clear commitment and specific programmefrom the Chrysler Corporation to increase the UKcontent of the 06, and for the Government to monitorthis programme closely.If the conditions described in (c) were not achieved,the majority view of the Board would incline againstassistance being provided.december 1975

ANNEX B

MESSAGE TO MR JOHN RICCARDO FROM THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY

My colleagues and I welcome the helpful discussion we had at our last meeting and we recognise that you put forward the new proposals about the additional model to be assembled at Ryton with the object of increasing the numbers employed and helping to cope with possible reactions of the workforce to plans to move plants from Ryton to Linwood as well as to improve the balance of models available and the integration of the Chrysler UK operation into your world-wide activities.

However my colleagues and I on further reflection are not satisfied that the various financial arrangements as we discussed them with you yesterday will strike fairly the balance of risk between HM Government and the Chrysler Corporation if we were additionally to provide the £55m of capital development funds. We consider that the first two tranches amounting to a total of £28m for the years 1976 and 1977 should either be financed direct by Chrysler Corporation or be provided in terms of some form of loan from HM Government against a guarantee from Chrysler Corporation itself. It is agreed that Chrysler Corporation would commit itself now to provide the first tranche of finance next year of £10-£12m towards the cost of the new £35m plan.

I am sure you will share our anxiety that the arrangement we make should be fully defensible in public to all parties. Accordingly I should be glad if you would include the proposition above in the proposals you are putting to your Board and if you would let me have your reaction to our proposals during the course of tomorrow (Wednesday).


AMNEX GMESSAGE TO THE SECRETARY OF STATE EOR INDUSTRY FROMMR. JOHN J. RICCARDO.I am happy to set forth in writing what I stated at our meeting thismorning,   Our Board has accepted the proposal contained in your letter ; that HMG loan Chrysler United Kingdom Ltd,  55 million over the next four years in amounts of 1976 -  20 million,1977 -  3 million, 19Y8 -  16 million and 1979 -  11 million, and thatChrysler Corporation guarantee the first  28 million of this loan.However, having said this, I also stated that we would appreciate yourconsidering whether either of two variations of this proposal would be acceptable to you :1,     Chrysler Corporation guarantees half of each year&apos;sloan, resulting in a total guarantee by Chrysler of 271 million, essentially, the same amount as in your letter but with slightly different timing,2.     Chrysler Corporation guarantees the last three years&apos;loans, resulting in a total guarantee by Chrysler of 35 million,   This would be a greater guarantee byChrysler than you proposed but again, with somewhat different timing.,In any case, in addition to the above, we would provide the funds necessaryt o begin assembly of the C6 car at Ryton in 1976,
I indicated that in view of our current very high world-wide bankborrowings and guarantees which we will be paying down in thenext year it would bo helpful in our bank relations if we could minimiseany immediate added commitments.   Since any improvements inour bank relations would be helpful to both of us, I thought it wouldbe useful to you if I apprised you of our thinking on this point.However, if you do not consider either of the variations to be desirableI want to repeat again that we accept your proposal.11th December 1975
