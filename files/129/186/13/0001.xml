DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY lS government(75) 1382 December 1975CABINETRETIREMENT PENSIONS EARNINGS RULEMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Social services. The earnings rule limits the amount of earnings which will beregarded as consistent with &quot;retirement&quot; and hence the amount a pensionercan earn before starting to lose benefit.    It applies only to those underage 70 for men, 65 for women.2. In the last Session, an amendment to the uprating Bill was forced onus, raising the earnings rule limit from the level of  13 a week to  20 inApril this year,  35 in April 1976 and  50 in April 1977.    We fought theamendment both in Committee and on Report^, but in the final vote (on29 January) nine of our backbenchers sided with the Opposition,,    We have said consistently and repeatedly that the resulting expenditure is low priority,because it benefits only the younger pensioners able to earn quite substan-tial amounts.THE problem. The issue for Cabinet is whether to introduce immediatelylegislation to rescind the increase to  35 due next Aprile    We have alreadyimplemented the increase to  20, and that is irretrievable.    It might benecessary to go as high as  26 next April, to get the Bill through.    But ifwe can limit the rise to  24 - which would be more than enough to match the movement of earnings since the  20 limit came in - we will save 50 million in 1976-77,  100 million in 1977-78,  65 million in 1978-79 and 50 million in 1979-80.    We badly need these savings, which are among theleast damaging of all our options on social security, and we are at presentcounting them towards the  3, 750 million target.    If we are to secure them,we must introduce a short Bill at once.4. For the future we would offer a commitment to increase the earningslimit each year from the 1977 uprating onwards.    (To increase it at the1976 uprating would mean two increases within the year and would eat intoCOPY NO31
the savings which are the object of the exercise;  and to raise the earningslimit in April 1977, separately from the benefit uprating, would involveunnecessary staff costs,)    This commitment would have considerablepresentational and political value.5. If we miss the opportunity of legislating now, allow the increase to 35 to go through, and rescind only the increase to  50 due in April 1977,we will be sacrificing about  50 million a year of potential savings whichwe, as a Government, will have to find from expenditure that we ourselveswould probably regard as having higher priority.    The Economic PolicyCommittee agreed that we should go for immediate legislation,,    In view ofits political sensitivity, however, and the fact that there will be difficulty infitting in a Bill, the Lord President suggested that the issue should bebrought to the Cabinet: colleagues will have seen his letter to theChancellor of the Exchequer of 27 November, and the Chancellor of theExchequer^ minute to the Prime Minister of 28 November,LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS6. We have examined the possibility of making the necessary amenderre nt to the Social Security Act in a Bill already in the legislative programme, but have found that there is no Bill which would be suitable.A separate Bill will therefore be needed, and time will have to be found for it for which at present there is no provision.    The Bill will, however, be short and can be ready for immediate introduction.    It will need to be given  an exceptional degree of priority - Second Reading before Christmas and royal Assent not later than 19 February 1976.    The reason is that people who wish to retire after 6 April 1976 must receive reasonable notice of theamount of earnings which can be regarded as consistent with &quot;retirement&quot;.POLITICAL FEASIBILITY7. The political feasibility will of course need to be weighed by our colleagues and in particular we shall need to have the appraisal of theLeaders of both Houses and of the Chief Whips.    The Secretary of State for social Services considers that the chances of getting the Bill through in time may be slim unless she can show that the effect in its first year of operation would be to divert the savings for use for a more urgent socialpurpose.    She would therefore wish to be able to announce the use of an extra  50 million, in 1976-77 only, elsewhere in her programme,,    TheChancellor of the Exchequer wishes, however, to make use of the 50 million of savings in 1976-77 to keep down the borrowing requirement inthat year; also he does not see how it would be possible to divert 50 million to another purpose in 1976-77 alone without incurring a continuing commitment for later years.2
8. Although we were twice defeated on the earnings rule at the turn ofthe year, the situation now has changed0    Our own supporters should know that public expenditure has to be reined back.    They have already won the substantial increase in the eai*nings rule which was implemented this year;we would be increasing this year&apos;s limit of  20 in line with the movementof earnings since it was introduced and, from the 1977 uprating onwards,we would be committing ourselves to further increases in line with earnings.    The row over our introducing the income tax age allowance,whose apparent cost was compared with that of relaxing the earnings rule,has now died down.    The Opposition are pressing insistently for cuts, andwould be put on the spot by a concrete proposal for one,conclusion. Weaskour colleagues to agree that we should introduce a short bill at once to rescind the increase in the earnings limit from  20 to  35 whichis due in April 1976, to substitute an increase to  24  (or at most to  26)and to commit us to raising the earnings limit, from the 1977 upratiug, in line with the movement of earnings.D W HBAGTreasury Chambers2 December 19753
