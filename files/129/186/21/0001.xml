COMPUTERS AND PRIVACYIntroduction&quot; 1. For some years now there has been increasing concern in this country as in others about actual or potential threats to the privacy of the individual.Part of this concern has arisen from the rapid growth in the use of computers,with their capacity for the swift processing and collation of information,including personal information. The Committee on Privacy under the cbair-manship of Sir Kenneth Younger, which reported in 1972*, had this to sayabout computers:&quot; We cannot on the evidence before us conclude that the computer asused in the private sector is at present a threat to privacy, but we recognisethat there is a possibility of such a threat becoming a reality in the future.&quot;(Paragraph 619.)2. In parallel with the Younger Committee&apos;s inquiry into the private sector,the Government reviewed the categories of information held, or likely to beheld, in the computer systems of Government Departments, and the rules governing its storage and use. The results of this review, complemented bycomparable information obtained about the use of computers in other partsof the public sector, are given in a report published as a supplement to this white Paper. That Report discloses no evidence to suggest that fears aboutthe improper use of computers in the public sector are justified by present practice. These systems are operated in accordance with administrative rules and procedures which provide substantial safeguards against the realisation ofany such fears.3. These findings, covering both the private and public sectors, should go along way towards reassuring the public about the past, the present, and theimmediate future. But the capabilities of computers are undoubtedly such asto give grounds for concern, and the potential threat which they pose to privacycould be transformed into a real one. It was the potential rather than theactual threat that led the Younger Committee to recommend:&quot; The Government should legislate to provide itself with machinery for keeping under review the growth in and techniques of gathering personal information and processing it with the help of computers. Such machinery should take the form of an independent body with members drawn from both the computer world and outside. For the sake of convenience, wecall it here a Standing Commission.&quot;  (Paragraph 621.)The Committee added that their investigation was limited to the private sector,but that the Government should consider including both the public and private sectors within the purview of the Standing Commission.4. The Government have concluded that there is need for legislation to beintroduced to set up machinery, not only to keep the situation under review,but also to seek to secure that all existing and future computer systems in whichpersonal information is held, in both the private and public sectors, are operated with appropriate safeguards for the privacy of the subject of that information.Their wish would be to introduce this legislation as soon as the preparatory work*Cmnd. 5012.fCmnd. 6354. The Report also contains details of the number of computers in use inGreat Britain, and discusses studies and regulations abroad.
is completed and the Parliamentary timetable allows, although clearly con-siderations of finance and manpower must enter into the calculation of the timing and content of the measure.The ProblemWhat is special about computers ?5. None of the functions carried out by computers within an informationsystem is different in kind from those which are, or could in principle be,carried out by traditional methods. But there are important differences inthe way, and the speed at which, those functions can be performed by computersystems on the one hand, and by traditional systems on the other.6. The speed of computers, their capacity to store, combine, retrieve and transfer data, their flexibility, and the low unit cost of the work which theycan do have the following practical implications for privacy:(1) they facilitate the maintenance of extensive record systems and theretention of data in those systems;(2) they can make data easily and quickly accessible from many distantpoints;(3) they make it possible for data to be transferred quickly from oneinformation system to another;(4) they make it possible for data to be combined in ways which might not otherwise be practicable;(5) because the data are stored, processed and often transmitted in a form which is not directly intelligible, few people may know what is inthe records, or what is happening to them.Benefits and dangers7. How computers affect people&apos;s lives depends on how they are used orabused. Their actual and potential benefits are great: in the saving of routineclerical work; in the economy, accuracy and speed with which information canbe processed; in forecasting, planning, or matching supply to demand; and,in the service of central and local government, in making public administrationmore responsive to the needs of the individual citizen and his family. It isclearly of the first importance that we should exploit to the full the benefits which computers can offer. It is against those benefits that we must weighthe possible threats. For, like other powerful tools that man has devised,computers have the capacity to do harm if they are misused.8. The principal potential dangers to privacy come from three main sources:(1) inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant information;(2) the possibility of access to information by people who should not orneed not have it;(3) the use of information in a context or for a purpose other than thatfor which it was collected.Any of these dangers can come about either intentionally, or by accident, and properly designed safeguards must therefore provide against both eventualities.Accuracy, completeness and relevance9. A competently designed computer system imposes disciplines on every stage in the processing of data which help to reduce mistakes and to ensure that
those errors which do occur are detected and corrected. This does not mean that computers will not make mistakes, but when they do, it will almost always be because some human being has made a mistake in the first place-perhapsby feeding the wrong data into the system, or by making an error in theinstructions (the &quot; program &quot;) given to the computer. If the mistake is in theprogram, it will not recur once the program has been corrected.10. It is equally important that information should be complete. In onesense, all information is incomplete since there are always other facts and circumstances which may be relevant to it. But information can be so in-complete as to be positively misleading; for example, to say that a bankruptcypetition was presented against a given individual on a given day may be perfectlyaccurate, but it would be misleading if the computer record did not show that the petition was dismissed with costs a fortnight later.11. The capacity of computers to store data in quantity could encourage thecollection and storage of more data than is strictly necessary for the task inhand. Long term storage is cheap, whereas updating and selective erasuremay be expensive. However, it is possible to build into the system procedures which will remove out of date or unnecessary data.12. In many cases, the best way of ensuring the accuracy, completeness andrelevance of personal information would be to give the people concerned theopportunity of checking and correcting the records held about them. Butthere are difficulties to be overcome. First, the people must know that theinformation system exists, and that it holds information about them. Secondly,there must be some verification procedure to ensure that the information isgiven only to the people concerned, and to nobody else. The cost of providingthese facilities may be high, particularly if the system was not originally designedto provide them.Access to, and use of, information13. Access to information should be restricted to what is necessary.Restricting access to information stored in a computer is a matter of securityprocedures. These should be designed to ensure that access is only possiblefor authorised persons, and that they can process data only in an authorisedway. Safeguarding privacy also requires, however, that those who do have authorised access to information do not breach the confidence in which it was obtained.Security14. The very complexity of computers and their operations creates problems for anyone who tries to gain unauthorised access to them. In practice, theperson making the attempt would need access to the machine or its associatedpunchcards, tapes, discs or other forms of memory store; in addition, he would need either himself to be an experienced computer technician, or to have the help of one or more experts, probably from within the system he is trying to penetrate. Unauthorised entry to the information store of a computer bysomeone who is not himself an expert is a far more complicated, difficult and expensive exercise than raiding a file of papers.15. Where data are printed out in human readable form, computer basedsystems share the security weaknesses of manual systems.  But the use of
computers allows those in charge of the system to decide how much information should be made available in this way an option which is less directly availableto the manager of a traditional system. Also, the physical concentration ofcomputer print-out in a small area can increase the opportunity for its effective protection.Confidentiality16. Where someone with authorised access to information uses that informa-tion for an improper purpose, it is a breach of confidence. This is a risk whichis as old as information itself; it applies both to computer and traditionalsystems, and our law already provides a number of remedies for it, some ofwhich are currently being considered by the Law Commissions following a recommendation of the Younger Committee*. The additional fear that arises from the development of computers is that someone will make improper useof the computer^ capacity for storing, processing and transferring data so asto combine information from a number of sources about individuals without their knowledge and consent.17. As the Supplementary Report to this White Paper makes clear, personal information held on Government computers is not misused in this way; andthe Younger Committee found no evidence of improper combination ofinformation about individuals in the private sector. Steps must be taken toensure that this continues to be so throughout the public and private sectors.However, some limited linkage of data from different systems for administrativeor statistical purposes (or both) may be justified subject to proper safeguards,and the Supplementary Report to this White Paper gives details of cases where this happens within central government. Measures to protect privacy must seek to ensure that operations of that kind are not authorised or undertakenunless they are expressly sanctioned by law or agreement, or are subject to the scrutiny and control of some independent body which has a duty to safeguard the privacy of the individual.18. The confidentiality of personal information held in a computer system can of course also be put at risk through accident, carelessness or sheer lack offoresight. In practice, that is the way in which confidentiality-and alsoaccuracy are most likely to be compromised in the foreseeable future. Anycomputer system which is properly designed and operated must therefore ensurethat risks of this kind have been foreseen, and that adequate safeguards are maintained to obviate them.Statistics19. One of the areas where great benefits can be derived from the use of computers is statistics. These are of great importance to industry (public and private) and to central and local government. Compared with a traditionalsystem, the computer can greatly enhance the quality of statistics, therebyimproving one of the bases upon which most planning for the future must rest.20. Statistical work carries few risks for privacy because it gives information about groups of people, even though the original data related to indentifiable*See Breach of Confidence, Law Commission Working Paper No. 58; H.M.S.O. 1974,
individuals. There need be no risk to privacy in allowing information originallycollected for some other purpose to be used for the compilation of statistics.This can be justified because information is efficiently used without jeopardisingthe confidence in which it was supplied. What is important, however, is thatthe output of statistics should guard against revealing information aboutidentified or identifiable individuals. In many cases it may well be appropriate for the identifier in a computerised statistical data system to be a code number which can only be related to the particular individual by reference to an indexwhich is kept secure outside the computer system.21. Statistics play an essential part in research, particularly in such fieldsas medicine, personal social services, education and economics. For example,the predisposing factors of a disease can sometimes only be found by discoveringwhat else those who suffer from it have in common. To find or confirm thecorrelations on which much research of this kind is based, it will often benecessary to combine data about the same people which are held in differentsystems. In this kind of statistical data processing it is necessary to take special precautions against risks for the privacy of the individual, especially asthe data may be very sensitive indeed.22. The Government believe that their own rules and procedures for statisticaloperations adequately meet the need to protect privacy, and are working on a set of guidelines to codify them.Safeguards for privacy23. The earlier part of this White Paper has outlined the potential dangers toprivacy arising from the increasing use of computers. Given proper safeguards,there is no reason why these dangers should become a reality. information about the safeguards which are already in force in the public sector is set outin the Supplementary Report to this White Paper; and many of these can be and are applied in the private sector too. Safeguards for security begin with traditional and obvious ones, such as the physical security of computercentres, limiting access to them, locks and keys (physical or electronic) forterminals, and so on. Confidentiality can be protected by managerial methods,such as limiting the information flow through the system, and deciding inadvance who shall have access to which data. Increasingly, however, the computer itself can be used to protect the security of the system of which itforms part, and the confidentiality of the information which it contains. It canbe programmed so as to limit access to certain data, or to require the use of aspecial password, or knowledge of a secret code, before the system can be entered. It can be programmed so that certain operations are forbidden andthe system gives an alarm if anyone attempts to carry them out. It can also beprogrammed to provide audit information, logging all operations or alloperations of certain kinds for subsequent inspection. In short, the computeritself can be used to help to protect the system of which it forms part.24. The level of protection is limited only by the expense in design effort,equipment costs and machine time of installing and maintaining the securitysafeguards. The ultimate safeguard lies in the fact that it is nearly alwayspossible to make a system so expensive to break into that the cost of penetratingit will be greater than the value of the information which it holds. At thesame time, the security systems which are most expensive to break tend also to
be those which are most expensive to install. The cost of providing the highest level of security for all personal information systems would be enormous.Fortunately, there is no need to do this: the need is only to provide protectionproportionate to the degree of sensitivity of the information within the system.In the long run some of the best protection lies in collecting only the minimumamount of information which the system needs to carry out its designed taskefficiently, in erasing it when it is no longer needed, in keeping different informa-tion systems segregated from each other, and above all in dealing honestly andopenly with the subjects of the information.25. Provided that there are adequate safeguards, the introduction of computers into information systems need not therefore entail any dangers toprivacy. On the contrary, computer systems which are designed and operated with a proper regard for the privacy of personal information can have manyadvantages over comparable manual systems, not only in speed, cheapness,accuracy, flexibility and efficiency, but in the very protection which they canthemselves provide against careless or unauthorised disclosures.26. But all this will only be so if proper safeguards are provided, and continue to be provided in the future. Much of the information now going intocomputers because it is eminently suitable for processing by computer isregarded by most people as particularly sensitive: medical records, criminalrecords, personal social services, education and work records, financial informa-tion and so on. The public is, therefore, entitled to have satisfactory assurances that its data and especially those which are sensitive are held and usedresponsibly, with due regard to accuracy, completeness, relevance, security andconfidentiality.Action for the Future27. It is against this background that the Government have considered what form the necessary safeguards against the misuse of computers should take. in formulating their proposals, the Government have also taken account of thevarious studies which have been made of this subject in other countries, andwhich are described in the Supplementary Report to this White Paper.28. The Government have concluded that it would not be desirable, orpracticable, to lay down by law detailed regulations for the operation of allcomputer systems. The best safeguards will vary between systems, andcomputer technology is still young, and is advancing ail the time. As the younger Committee said, &quot; legislation cannot be expected to spell out everydetail, and many details will be beyond the manageable scope even of sub-ordinate legislation &quot;. (Paragraph 609.) An attempt to legislate in too muchdetail might well produce a statute which would be out of date as soon as it came into force.29. Nor would it be enough merely to set up another non-statutory com-mittee, even if it included experts in the field, to keep developments underreview and advise whether legislation might be required in due course andif so when and of what kind.30. In the Governments view the time has come when those who use com-puters to handle personal information, however responsible they are, can nolonger remain the sole judges of whether their own systems adequately safe-guard privacy. . The safeguards must become subject to independent scrutiny;
and independent scrutiny connotes a declaration by law of the standardsaccording to which the adequacy of safeguards in particular systems is to be judged. The Government have therefore decided that the right course is tointroduce legislation involving two elements: first the establishment of a set of objectives, to set standards governing the use of computers that handle personal information; and second the establishment of a permanent statutory agency to oversee the use of computers, in both the public and private sectors, to ensurethat they are operated with proper regard for privacy and with the necessarysafeguards for the personal information which they contain.31. Legislation to establish this permanent machinery will inevitably take some time, both to prepare and to enact. The Government believe that itwould be wrong to leave things as they are until this legislative process can becompleted. It will therefore appoint, at once, a non-statutory body whosefunction it will be to prepare the way for the setting up of the permanent machinery. This interim body will be referred to here as the Data ProtectionCommittee.Statutory Objectives32. The objectives which the legislation will declare need not be enforceableby civil or criminal processes. But they must provide the standards by whichthe adequacy of safeguards for the privacy of the individual should be judged.Therefore, they must be more than mere declarations of broad principle andmust set the standards with a sufficient degree of particularity. The range of computers holding personal information, and the types of information held,are wide and varied, and no set of objectives could be formulated which wouldbe universally applicable. For good and valid reasons, particular systems willnot be able to satisfy every objective, but each case of divergence should be amatter for independent appraisal. The objectives which the government regard as desirable are set out in paragraph 34, but one of the tasks of the DataProtection Committee will be to refine these further if it considers that more precise standards should be set. In doing this the Committee will have to balance the risk to the privacy of the individual in particular features of computeroperation against practical considerations, including considerations of cost,in order that the obligations on computer users should be no more than pro-portionate to the degree of risk. One important purpose of these objectiveswill be to supply guidelines for the design of future systems.33. The general requirements for these statutory objectives are alreadyapparent, and the ten principles recommended by the Younger Committee forthe private sector, and set out in Table 1, provide the starting point. As thediscussion in the Supplementary Report on the studies carried out in othercountries shows, the general tendency has been to recommend sets of principlesbroadly in line with those formulated by the Younger Committee. the objectives to be declared in the statute should, therefore, cover very much thesame ground.34. There can be no doubt that those responsible for holding personal information in computers must be under an obligation to take all reasonableprotective measures to ensure that the information cannot fall into the wronghands, whether by design, inadvertence or deliberate penetration. It is obviously desirable that those who hold personal information in computers
should not conceal the scope of their operations particularly from those towhom the information relates. The existence and purpose of such informationsystems should therefore be publicly known, as well as the categories of datawhich they handle, what they do with data, and which interests have access todata. People asked to provide information should have a right to know for what purposes it will be used, and who is likely to have access to it. Theinformation should not be used for a purpose other than one for which itwas given or obtained without either the consent of the person whom it concerns,or some other authorised justification. Only personal information which isnecessary for declared purposes should be collected. The operator of thesystem should be responsible for ensuring its accuracy and relevance, and thesubject of the information should be able to satisfy himself about this, which inmany cases will best be achieved by giving him the opportunity to see it, checkit and, if necessary, have it corrected. The subject should also be able to find out what has been done with the information and to whom it has been given.The information should be kept only for as long as it is needed. Safeguardsare needed to ensure that statistics are presented in a way which does not revealdetails of an identified or identifiable individual. Some of these objectiveswill apply to all systems, others may need modification in the light of particular circumstances.35. Each of these objectives however raises the question how far those responsible for a computer system must go in supplying information. Ideallythe purpose and method of operation of the system, the rules about access,and the length of time for which information is stored (to take only a fewexamples) should be known at least to the subjects of the information and tothose who are called upon to supply information. How far can these idealsbe realised without disproportionate costs and without creating undueelaboration in administrative processes which computers are meant to rendersimpler and more speedy? What information can employers reasonably be expected to disclose to employees from personnel records held on computersand what may they reasonably withhold on management grounds? Andshould computer users (and perhaps their informants) be entitled to the defenceof qualified privilege in defamation proceedings at the suit of a person whohas been given access to information held about him? Questions like theserequire further study and consultation before a set of statutory objectivescan be stated with the degree of particularity that the situation demands.A Statutory Agency36. The second element in the legislation will be the establishment of apermanent agency to oversee the use of computers that handle personal information. This agency, which it will be convenient here to call the DataProtection Authority, will consist of people with knowledge and experience of computers, and of representatives of the other interests most closely affectedby the Go vernmenfs proposals, inclu ding the general public. Such a permanent and independent agency, with the necessary expertise and continuous commit-ment to the subject, will have the required flexibility, the ability to learn fromexperience, and the ability to evolve and (where necessary) to change its policiesabout the safeguards most suitable for different circumstances at different times.
37. Such an Authority will need powers to carry out its tasks effectively.There are at least two possible approaches:&apos; (1) The Authority could be a registration and licensing agency, able toenforce registration of relevant details of the personal informationsystems within its jurisdiction, to prescribe safeguards for them, andto ensure (as a condition of the grant and renewal of licences whichwould be necessary before the systems could be maintained and operated) that those safeguards are instituted and observed.(2) The Authority could be a body with power to call for information on what systems are being operated, by whom, how, and subject to whatsafeguards; to make and publicise its own recommendations aboutthose systems; to investigate complaints and suspected malpractices;and to publish its findings.There are arguments for both of these choices. Before the Government cometo a final decision they need further advice about the detailed implications ofthe possible arrangements. The Data Protection Committee will be asked togive this advice. Its recommendations will be published, and the Governmentwill announce their conclusions after a sufficient time to allow scope for publicdebate. There are a number of other points to which the Data ProtectionCommittee will be asked to give their attention: how far, for example, theprotection for privacy that the statute will provide for individuals should extend to bodies and associations; what is to be regarded, for the purpose of thestatutory control, as a &quot; computer &quot; and how personal information should be defined; and what special arrangements are necessary to deal with information supplied for computer records, not by the subject of the information, but by a third party such as an employer, or from published material.Costs38. Clearly, the measures needed to protect the confidentiality of personal information will entail some costs for society; but equally clearly, it is essentialthat such expenditure should be kept to the minimum which will achieve the desired results. In considering the organisation and powers of the proposedAuthority, the Data Protection Committee will, therefore, be asked to payparticular attention to the costs of the various alternatives. The objective,whatever choice is finally adopted, will be to make the Authority financiallyself-supporting, and the Committee will be asked to advise on how this can best be done. It might, for example, be desirable to seek to recoup costs by levyingcertain fees and charges. The Committee will also need to bear in mind theadditional expenditure which might be required by computer users in both thepublic and private sectors to ensure that their systems incorporate the necessarysafeguards. In reaching its final decision on the content of the proposed legislation, the Government will take these matters fully into account.Exceptions39. While the general principle will be that the purview of the authority should extend throughout both the public and private sectors, there will need to be certain exceptions. These will be as narrow as is consistent with thepublic interest. There must, for example, be a procedure for exempting anycomputerised information system which is kept for the strict purposes of national security, since that security would be jeopardised if the means of maintaining
it were made public. Exemptions on these grounds will require the personalcertificate of the Home Secretary.40. Exceptions will also be needed for some at least of the computer systemswhich facilitate the work of the police in the prevention and detection of crime.Their purpose could well be defeated if details about them were known to thoseagainst whose activities they are aimed, and it would certainly be defeated if the subjects of the information were entitled to know what data were held about them. Such exemptions will, however, require the certificate of the HomeSecretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland or the Secretary of State for northern Ireland, who will have the power to specify any additional safeguards which need to be observed in the system concerned.41 Medical records present a problem of a different kind. As well asdetails supplied by the patient, medical records contain clinical information about the patienfs treatment and care. The doctor may not always considerit to be in the patienfs best interest to have access to this information. this factor should not affect the decision on what information is held in the computerbut must be taken into account when applying principles about the disclosure ofinformation.42. The Data Protection Committee will be asked to take full account ofthese considerations in framing its recommendations, and will be free to make recommendations about other professional records, including social workrecords.Transitional measures43. The work of the Data Protection Committee should aim to ensure thatthe necessary interval before legislation can be introduced and come into force will not be one of doubt and uncertainty for the computer industry, computerusers, and the public. These interests will be consulted to the fullest extent possible while the legislation is being planned, bearing in mind that particularresponsibility for implementing the safeguards proposed will fall upon the professional analysts, programmers and consultants. The profession is stillyoung, but they have already begun, through the British Computer Society, to devise appropriate codes, and full advantage should be taken of their expertise.44. The Government will also, pending legislation, ensure that theadministrative rules under which its own computer systems are operated willcontinue to provide safeguards for the accuracy and relevance of personal information, and for the privacy of the subjects of that information. TheGovernment trust that other computer users, in both the public and private sectors, will follow this lead.
The Younger Committee^ Principles *1. Information should be regarded as held for a specific purpose and not beused, without appropriate authorisation, for other purposes.2. Access to information should be confined to those authorised to have it for the purpose for which it was supplied.3. The amount of information collected and held should be the minimum necessary for the achievement of a specified purpose.4. In computerised systems handling information for statistical purposes,adequate provision should be made in their design and programmes forseparating identities from the rest of the data.5. There should be arrangements whereby the subject could be told aboutthe information held concerning him.6. The level of security to be achieved by a system should be specified inadvance by the user and should include precautions against the deliberateabuse or misuse of information.7. A monitoring system should be provided to facilitate the detection of anyviolation of the security system.8. In the design of information systems, periods should be specified beyond which the information should not be retained.9. Data held should be accurate. There should be machinery for thecorrection of inaccuracy and the updating of information.10. Care should be taken in coding value judgements.*Set out in paragraphs 592 to 599 of their Report, Cmnd. 5012.Printed in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office by Oyez Press LimitedDd 141842  K48 12/75

COMPUTERS: SAFEGUARDS FOR PRIVACYf. introduction. The Government are publishing this Report as a supplement to theirWhite Paper on Computers and Privacy. *2. The Committee on Privacy, chaired by Sir Kenneth Younger, reportedthat the total number of computers in use or on order in the United kingdom for all purposes in April 1971 was 6,075.f More recent information fromthe National Computer Index shows that by April 1975 the number of computersactually operational in the United Kingdom had risen to 13,263. Althoughthe figures are not strictly comparable, they indicate that the number hasroughly doubled in only four years. Not all of these computers are used tostore personal information. But undoubtedly, the use of computers to handlesuch information is increasing rapidly, in both the private and public sectors.3. In parallel with the Younger Committee&apos;s examination of the private sector, an interdepartmental working party carried out a review of the categories of information held, or likely to be held, in the computer systems of GovernmentDepartments, and the rules governing its storage and use.4. The working party completed its investigation in 1972. The present report summarises its findings, brings them up to date, and gives comparableinformation about computers in those parts of the public sector which do notform part of central government and which the working party did not thereforestudy. It also discusses the safeguards which operate to protect the privacyof personal information held in public sector computers.5. The Report also gives some statistics of computer use in the UnitedKingdom, and outlines surveys which have been undertaken in the private sector since the Younger Committee reported; and it concludes with a dis-cussion of studies carried out, and practices adopted or proposed, in otherparts of the world.2. Central Government Computers6. This chapter describes how central government use computers for handlingpersonal information, and the existing safeguards which protect the confidential -tiality of that information. The exceptions are computer systems kept forthe strict purposes of national security: these are not described here, becausesecurity would he compromised if the means of maintaining it were publiclyknown.Governmenfs need for personal information7. The state provides, or gives financial help towards, a number of services for its citizens for example, health, social services and education. To do this, it collects duties, taxes and contributions. These functions could not becarried out effectively without a good deal of information about the needs* Cmnd. 6353.t Cmnd. 5012.
and circumstances of individuals. Such information is also required to providethe statistics needed for effective planning and the efficient allocation of resources.Government computer tasks involving personal information8. There are at present some 220 computer-based administrative &quot; tasks&quot;&quot;in central government, which use personal information about people otherthan the Governments own staff. These are listed in summary form in Table 1.They include the records of the National Health Service which are centrallyheld.* The table also includes statistical tasks where the names of the individuals to whom the data relate are held in the computer system itself,or where, although the names are not held in the computer system, they are held in the same Department so that they could be linked (e.g. via a sourcedocument or an index) with the data. This chapter does not concern itself with information held about businesses or business statistics, but certaintasks are included in Table 1 because they contain entries for partnershipsand one-man businesses from which information about individuals might bededuced.9. The number of persons included in any task ranges from under 2,000people to a maximum (in the case of the Census of Population) of the whole population of the country; the majority of tasks deal with between 10,000 andone million persons each.10. The personal information held for the purposes of these different tasksvaries widely. It includes personal particulars (name, date of birth, marriage),address and changes of address, education background and qualifications,housing, possessions (cars and other property), occupation (current job,previous jobs, dangerous jobs, retirement), health (general practice records,hospital treatment and dental care), and money (pay, pension, social security,tax and savings). In total the list is formidable, but each task includes onlya small part of all this information in its records. Moreover, the information is distributed amongst many different computers. The Government have noplans to construct a central data bank which would bring together in onecomputer system all the personal information available in government depart-ments the administrative advantages to be gained from such a course aredebatable, and the practical difficulties and costs would be formidable-andthey have no intention of allowing the computer systems under their control to be linked together to produce such a result.Consequences for Privacy11. The interdepartmental working party reported that the normal resultsof large-scale computerisation of records in Government Departments werethese: (i) The computer-aided system needed fewer people to operate it thanthe manual system which it replaced and so the number of potentialobservers of the data was less than before.* For details of other information on NHS computers see Chapter 3.
(ii) The computer took on so much of the clerical work (checking, sorting,calculating, writing, and so on) that the total time spent by human beings in examining the information in the system was very much reduced.(iii) People employed in computer systems usually had fewer opportunitiesthan their clerical counterparts to examine or copy the data they werehandling. Computer operators seldom saw in readable form morethan a small fraction of the data passing through the system.(iv) Many operations were carried out without any human contact withthe total record.The working party therefore concluded that the introduction of computersystems would in no way increase the threat to privacy by unauthorised disclosure of personal information held in the systems.12. The working party also considered threats to privacy other thanunauthorised disclosure in particular the danger of inaccuracy or unnecessaryretention of information and the possible dangers involved in the authorisedtransfer of information within, between or beyond departments.Accuracy and retention of data13. Inaccuracy in a personal record may result in dangers to privacy; a conviction for dishonesty might, for instance, be attributed to the wrongJohn Smith; a taxpayer might be listed as a defaulter when his assessmentwas in fact still under appeal; or a confidential notice might be sent to the wrong address. Information held in computers is no more prone to thiskind of error than information in manual records. Government Departmentsmake every effort to ensure that information entering a computer is accurate,especially by the use of credibility and consistency checks to detect certainerrors which a human being might not notice. Moreover, accurate information is far less likely to be transferred incorrectly by a computer than by a humanbeing. The quality of record keeping in a computer system is almost alwayshigher than in a manual system.14. Government Departments are also anxious to avoid holding information for too long not only might this violate privacy, but it also reduces processingefficiency. The need to hold information is therefore regularly reviewed,and frequent updating (which includes the discarding and destruction of unnecessary information as well as the insertion of new material) is a normalroutine.Authorised transfers of information15. Table 2 lists all transfers of information about identifiable individualsfrom the computer branches of departments to recipients other than the userbranch (that part of the Department which has managerial responsibility forperforming the task*), the individual himself or his duly authorised agent(e.g. his accountant, solicitor or banker). It distinguishes human-readableoutput (e.g. printed page, microfilm, etc.) from machine-readable output(e.g. magnetic tape or disc).* Exceptions are local employment offices which pay unemployment benefit on behalfof DHSS, police forces using the Police National Computer and Post Offices issuing broad-casting licences.
16. It will be seen that only a small proportion of the tasks in Table 1 are involved in such transfers, all of which take place for specific and well-definedpurposes. In these few cases, information about identifiable individuals is&apos;passed to third parties in accordance with the rules governing transfers ofinformation generally (i.e. the rules which apply whether or not the information is held on computers). This means that, without exception, transfers ofinformation may take place only if the user branch is satisfied that the third party has a need to know the particular information, and can be trusted to handle it responsibly.17. In all cases, the decision to transfer information to a third party is amatter of carefully considered policy, for which the responsible Minister isanswerable to Parliament, and in many cases such disclosures may take placeonly under statutory authority.18. These transfers of information take place for a number of reasons.They can reduce demands on the public to repeat information which theyhave already provided. They can expedite the process of Government: it is sometimes cheaper and quicker to obtain information from another department or another part of the same Department than directly from the person concerned.They may make it easier to identify the needs of an individual by connectingrelevant details about him. The Government fully recognise that the un-controlled transfer of personal information, even within Government, is undesirable and that certain records, such as income tax returns, medicalrecords, census returns and criminal records, merit a high degree of inter-departmental confidentiality and this they receive.19. Most of the tasks mentioned in paragraph 8 above are carried outon a computer within the Department which sponsors and controls the task.Some may be run in another Government Department. On rare occasionswork has to be given to external organisations, including commercial bureaux.In all these cases, the sponsoring Department ensures that the safeguards forprivacy conform with the standards which the Department would itself apply,and one means of ensuring this is to hand the records to the bureau in such a form that the individual to whom they refer cannot be identified.Security20. The Government use three main categories of physical and technicalsafeguards: (i) Control of physical access to the computer area (machines, tapes,discs, etc.) and any terminals. This includes the issue of officialpasses or badges to staff, the escorting of visitors, the locking of entry points, and the recording of entries and exits.(ii) Technical safeguards which can be built into the system. the computer can be programmed to allow access to particular filesonly in response to an authorised password, and to report succesful and unsuccessful attempts at access. The data produced may alsobe &quot; scrambled,&quot; so that only authorised personnel can interpretthem.
(iii) Organisational and procedural measures to guard against misuse ofinformation. For example, the principle of &quot; separation of duties &quot;may be applied: that is, access to some data may be allowed only with the knowledge and consent of someone in a different part of theorganisation.The safeguards vary with the nature of the system and the information whichit holds. For any given system, a decision on the most appropriate measuresis the responsibility of the sponsoring Department and, ultimately, of itsMinisters. These measures are subject to regular review, both within theDepartment concerned and by other Government authorities.21. The arrangements for safeguarding information entrusted to the Govern-ment in confidence were tightened up in 1971, following publicity about theactivities of certain private inquiry firms. Although allegations have beenmade from time to time about access by unauthorised persons to informationheld in Government computers, these have not been substantiated.Confidentiality22. In addition to the safeguards set out above, information held incomputers is subject to the same stringent Departmental administrative rulesas information held in manual files. In both cases the appropriate minister is responsible to Parliament.23. Some administrative rules are derived from statute or subordinate legislation. Certain statutes (for example, the Births and Deaths RegistrationAct 1953, the Marriage Act 1949 and the Land Charges Act 1925) impose a requirement to disclose specified information in specified cases, subject tospecified procedures. There are also a number of statutes which prohibit the disclosure of information. The Taxes Management Act 1970, for example,requires Inland Revenue officials to make declarations that information received in the execution of their duties will not be disclosed except for thepurposes of those duties, for a prosecution for an Inland Revenue offence,or in other cases required by law. Particulars of business dealings obtained for statistical purposes under the Statistics of Trade Act 1947 may not beused for assessing tax: they are not available even to the administrative sideof the Department which has collected them. Information about identifiableindividuals collected in the Census of Population, under the provisions of the census Act 1920, is not divulged by the Census Offices to third parties. Otherexamples are the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, and the Rehabilitation of OffendersAct 1974.24. Not all statistical censuses and surveys are carried out on a statutory basis. Many are voluntary, but even for these strict confidentiality proceduresapply. As an indication of their concern, the Government are now working on a set of guidelines covering the procedures for processing and safeguardingstatistical data.25. There is also some general legislation which restricts the use by Govern-ment of the information which it holds. Under Section 2 of the official secrets Act 1911 it is an offence for any person who has information which
he has obtained or to which he has access, in the course of his official duties,to communicate it to anyone other than someone to whom it is his officialduty to communicate it. It is also an offence for a civil servant to retain&apos;such information longer than his official duties require or to fail to take all reasonable care of it, or so to conduct himself as to endanger its safety; andit is an offence for anyone to receive information which is passed to him in&apos;contravention of the Act.*Accountability to Parliament26. Ministers are accountable to Parliament for the administrative rules which protect the confidentiality of personal information within their Depart-ments. This means that Ministers can be questioned in Parliament not only about the rules themselves but also about individual breaches, or allegedbreaches, of confidentiality. It also means that specific complaints can be investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration (the&quot; Ombudsman &quot;). At the request of a Member of Parliament, the Commis-sioner can investigate complaints about &quot; any action taken by or on behalfof a Government Department, being action taken in the exercise of administra-tive functions,&quot; and the Government accept that the abuse or misuse of infor-mation held in Government computers comes under this definition. TheCommissioner has confirmed that he would consider it appropriate for himto investigate complaints submitted to him about any alleged misuse of Govern-ment computers. Machinery therefore already exists for the investigation of such complaints. Moreover, the Commissioner can investigate not onlythe particular action complained of, but also the Departmental rule (if therewas one) which led to the action. It is the present Commissioners practice,where he considers that such a course would be appropriate, to ask departments to review administrative rules and to let him know the results of that review.Conclusions27. In summary, then, the Government hold a good deal of information about individual citizens, which they require to meet the individuals&apos; needs and those of the community as a whole. An increasing amount of this infor-mation is held in computers, because the government must make use of themost advanced techniques if these can help to carry out necessary functionsmore efficiently and economically. But the Government also have a duty to each individual to ensure that the information which he or she has impartedto them in confidence is not disclosed to anyone who does not need to knowit, and that it is not used for the wrong purposes. This chapter has described the measures already in force to protect the privacy of the personal informa-tion held by the government about individual citizens. But the government recognise that the increasing computerisation of its records has given rise to*A Departmental Committee on section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, under theChairmanship of Lord Franks, recommended in its Report (Cmnd. 5104) the repeal of that section and its replacement by an Official Information Act. The Committee consideredthat it should be an offence under the new Act for a civil servant to disclose, contrary to his duty, information given to the Government by private individuals or concerns. TheGovernment are considering the recommendation of the Franks Committee and intend to announce their conclusions as soon as possible.
concern in some areas, and they are determined that the highest standards of confidentiality should be maintained in the future. They have therefore&quot;decided that their proposals for safeguarding the privacy of personal informa-tion held in computers should apply not only to systems in the private sector and in other parts of the public sector, but to systems in Government Depart-ments also.  The details of those proposals are set out in the White Paper. ** Cmnd. 6353.

3. Computers in the National Health Service28. National Health Service records contain personal information aboutnearly everyone in the country. The authorities and individuals using thoserecords (whether maintained on computers or, as most still are, manually)have the responsibility for safeguarding the information which they contain.29. Lists of general practitioners&apos; patients are held by Family PractitionerCommittees * established by Area Health Authorities; each general practitionerholds his own patients&apos; records; and each Health Authority holds recordsabout the health service which it administers. Information from these widelyscattered records is collected for management or research purposes eitherregionally or centrally; and both manual and computer systems are used forthis purpose.30. There are three large central records: the National Health ServiceCentral Register for England and Wales and similar Registers for Scotlandand Northern Ireland. All are manual systems. They contain a limited amount of non-medical information about everyone who has registered witha National Health Service general practitioner and about all the newly-born.The registers help to control the issue of new NHS numbers and, by dissemina-ting information about patients who have died, left the country or joined the armed Forces, they assist Family Practitioner Committees to maintain the accuracy of doctors&apos; lists. These lists are important in defining a doctor&apos;obligations to the Service, and they provide the basis for a substantial partof his remuneration. Each Register also acts as a clearing house for the transmission of information between Family Practitioner Committees whenpatients change their doctor. Consideration is now being given to puttingFamily Practitioner Committees&apos; own records on computers, which could then handle some of the Committees&apos; administrative tasks. A pilot scheme has proved successful and a second trial is planned. Further success couldpoint the way to a general computer system for Family Practitioner Committeerecords.31. Most Regional Health Authorities have their own computers whichperform various management tasks and a range of applications peculiar to health care. Computing facilities in Wales are provided by the Welsh HealthTechnical Services Organisation. In Scotland computing facilities are providedby Health Board consortia computers and by the Scottish Office ComputerService. One of the most important of these applications in England andWales is Hospital Activity Analysis (HAA) in which computers are used to analyse the data about periods which people spend as hospital in-patients,in order to provide doctors and administrators with clinical, management and planning information. A number of NHS hospitals have computers anda list of typical computing tasks using personal information from whichindividuals can be identified is given in Table 3.32. Department of Health and Social Security computers are used to processthe Mental Health Enquiry (MHE), which records data for psychiatric patients* In Scotland and Northern Ireland there are no Family Practitioner Committees; the lists are held in Scotland by the Health Boards and in Northern Ireland by the Central ServiceAgency.
similar to that covered by HAA for other patients. The MHE records includethe names of the patients. The identifiable data are used in a limited way toassist bona fide medical research workers in special projects. DHSS computersare also used for the provision of other health service statistics and for NHSsuperannuation work. In Scotland, the Scottish Health Service common services Agency undertakes similar statistical processing work, so far using the facilities of the Scottish Office Computer Service and Area Health Board.In Northern Ireland the Department of Health and Social Services undertakesall Health Service computing work using computers at the Department ofFinance and the Queen&apos;s University of Belfast.33. Computers are used by the Dental Estimates Board to handle NHSrecords and produce statistics; by universities, mainly for research purposes;and by the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys where a variety ofmorbidity data, some including the names of patients, is processed to producestatistics and to assist epidemiological studies.34. The complex field of computing within the National Health Service wasreviewed in 1971 by representatives of the NHS, DHSS and a firm of manage-ment consultants. * This resulted in fresh guidance being given about safe-guards for computer records including security measures, and about the need to restrict the use of medical records held on computers to the same purposes has the manual records which they replace.35. The policy about the confidentiality of personal information stored incomputers is the same as that which has always applied to other ways of storingit. The practices of the authorities responsible for the health services accord,by tradition and discipline, with the spirit of the Younger Committee&apos;sprinciples.! These practices are influenced and assisted by the close involve-ment of several professions which have long been sensitive to the need toprotect the privacy of their clients. The medical profession in particular hasa well-known and old-established tradition of maintaining the confidentialityof information, and the statement by the Medical Research Council&quot; Responsibility in the use of medical information for research &quot; guides the profession about the uses of personal data for research.* The report of the review &quot; Using Computers to Improve Health Services A review for the National Health Service,&quot; is available from DHSS (CR3), 6-16 St. Andrew Street,London EC4 3AD.t See Table 1 in the White Paper Cmnd. 6353.

4. Police Computers36. Computers are used for a variety of police administrative purposessuch as pay, personnel records, crime and accident statistics and in a fewinstances the records of firearms and shotgun certificates. Computer services for these purposes are provided for the Metropolitan Police by a joint organisa-tion which also serves the Home Office (where the safeguards described in chapter 2 for central government computers apply); and for other forces bytheir local authorities (where the safeguards described in Chapter 5 for localgovernment computers apply). Police operational purposes, especially inrelation to criminal records and the detection of crime, are in part served bythe Police National Computer and to a small but increasing extent by smallercomputers used by individual forces. The use of computers for these purposesis described in paragraphs 42-46 below.Police Records37. The Central Criminal Record Office, which is the responsibility of theCommissioner of Police of the Metropolis, maintains a national record ofpersons convicted of serious offences and of wanted and missing persons,stolen vehicles and other property. Its records are compiled from information about convictions which all police forces and penal institutions send to NewScotland Yard. These records are available to all forces in the UnitedKingdom, and are essential to the prevention and detection of crime. Extractsare given to the courts when they need to know the previous criminal record of persons convicted of criminal offences.38. Nine regional criminal record offices in England and Wales, and separateoffices in Scotland and Northern Ireland, hold records about local crimesand criminals and supplement the service given to forces by the Central CriminalRecord Office. Records are also held at individual force headquarters. Thesecurity and confidentiality of regional and force records is the responsibilityof the appropriate chief officer of police.39. Chief officers of police have always taken great care to prevent unaufhor-ised disclosure to persons outside the police service of information from recordoffices. Information about previous convictions must be provided for thecourts and the prison service but otherwise the principle is that no recordinformation is given to anyone, however responsible, unless considerations of public interest justify it. Since 1 July 1975, the reporting of many oldconvictions has been further restricted by the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act1974.40. The principles and procedures governing the supply of police informationhave been carefully reviewed since the Younger Committee reported, andwere described in a statement in Parliament by the then Home Secretary on14 June 1973. Briefly, reports about current convictions are made by thepolice to the relevant public or professional body about (a) doctors, dentists, nurses, persons employed in the care of children,and youth leaders, because they stand in a position of trust tovulnerable members of society;
(b) civil servants, atomic energy and Post Office temporary and permanent staff, in the interests of national security; and(c) magistrates, justices of the peace, barristers, solicitors, and solicitors&apos;managing clerks, because they have a direct responsibility for theadministration of the law.Anyone about whom a current conviction is reported to a professional or publicbody is told that the report has been made.41. Where the police are authorised by statute to provide evidence aboutthe suitability of applicants for certain licences, they must discharge their duty to assist the courts or other statutory body. The applicants in thesecases are told what evidence is given by the police. The police also maintainthe practice, which does not have specific statutory authority, of helpingSocial Services Departments in considering applications from adoptive andfoster parents. The background of applicants to join police forces is alsochecked and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and the GamingBoard are assisted by reports from the police. In all these cases the applicantsare told that checks are being made.The Police National Computer42. The Police National Computer, which began to operate in 1974, is theresponsibility of the Home Office in consultation with the police service,who share the cost. Its purpose is to automate the storage and retrieval ofcertain of the records held by the central and regional criminal record offices and by police forces: these comprise indices to records of persons convicted of serious offences, wanted and missing persons, stolen vehicles, disqualifieddrivers and persons with suspended sentences. Information about keepersof motor vehicles, kept by the Department of the Environment at Swansea,will also be available.43. The principles and procedures governing the disclosure of police recordinformation outlined in paragraph 39 above are not affected by the PoliceNational Computer. The computer replaces manual methods and speeds upaccess to the records in order to give forces better operational support, but theChief Constable of the force which receives the information remains responsiblefor ensuring that it is not passed outside the police service except in accordancewith the arrangements described in paragraph 39. There are extensive safe-guards for the security of the information stored on the computer: all computerterminals are in supervised premises, protected from unauthorised access andconnected to the computer centre by private lines; and information cannot beput into or obtained from the computer unless the police operator identifieshis terminal and proves his authority.Other Police Operational Computers44. The smaller operational computers used by forces are designed primarily to speed up police response to calls for assistance; they are also to be usedfor other tasks previously done manually. A few forces obtain help from their local authority computer for some of these purposes.
45. A computer system is being planned to handle information held by theMetropolitan Police about crime, criminals and their associates. The system will be internal to those branches of the force who now use this information in manually held records, and it will not be connected to any other system.In the Thames Valley Police a force computer is being used experimentally toprocess and analyse the records of all the force&apos;s collators (who assemble andcollate information required for the prevention and detection of crime). Theobject of the experiment is to see whether the use of a computer for these purposes could be of significant operational benefit in a typical police force.46. The security and confidentiality of information relating to crime andcriminals held on a local computer is the responsibility of the chief constableconcerned. Special attention is given to safeguards against unauthorisedaccess.5. Local Government Computers47. Since the last war an increasingly large proportion of total public expenditure has been devoted to local government. This reflects the widenedrange of services undertaken by local authorities. Even though certainfunctions in connection with gas, electricity, water (in England and Wales)and Health Services have been transferred to other authorities, these losses have been counterbalanced by the growth of new services and the expansionof others, notably those connected with education, housing and services for children, the elderly and the handicapped.48. Emphasis is increasingly being placed on the interdependence of services,which are no longer regarded (as they tended to be in the past) as self-containedand separate functions, but rather as activities which are complementary to eachother and which can be provided effectively only on this basis. The RoyalCommission on Local Government in England, 1966-69,* identified two mainand related groups of services: the &quot;environmental&quot; and the &quot;personal&quot;groups; and it was one of the aims of local government reorganisation to ensurethat, so far as is practicable, responsibility for each group is placed in the handsof the same authorities so that the full benefits of the integrated planning,organisation and management of these services can be obtained.49. A significant effect of reorganisation, which took place in 1974 in Englandand Wales, and in 1975 in Scotland, has been to reduce in all three countries the total number of authorities, with a consequent increase in the average size of each local authority, in terms of both population and resources.50. In short, the increase in both the range and complexity of local govern-ment services has been accommodated by the creation of authorities which arenot only responsible for related groups of services, but also better able to benefit from the use of computers as part of more sophisticated managementtechniques. The increase in the use of computers in local government sincethe mid-1960s is, therefore, certain to continue.* Cmnd. 4040.
51. The Local Authorities Management Services and Computer Committee,which was set up by local government in 1967 to provide a national advisory service for local authorities on management matters, maintains a register oflocal authority computers and the uses to which they are put. That information is published periodically. In April 1975 the Department of the Environmentpublished the report of the General Review of Local Authority ManagementInformation Systems, which had been prepared for the Secretary of State forthe Environment by McKinsey and Company Incorporated. The reportsurveyed current work and thinking on the development and use of computersby local authorities, and put forward recommendations as to how the verygreat potential benefits of computers could most effectively be exploited in local government in future.52. Broadly, the main purposes for which computers were first used in localgovernment were those involving the large-scale handling of financial data,such as rates and housing rents. Since then, they have been used by a numberof local authorities for the storage and processing of data already kept by themin other forms; for instance, personnel records on local authority employees,electoral registers, and educational and social services records. The use of computers in local government for this sort of record-keeping and processingwill continue to develop. In addition, computers are likely to be increasinglyused as general aids to management in financial calculations, in the appraisalof alternative courses of action, and in the operation and planning of related services which involve data based on population, land, property, employment and traffic flows. As the McKinsey report emphasised, the use of computersfor appropriate tasks brings significant advantages in terms of speed and efficiency, and can play a valuable role in enabling local authorities to makethe optimum use of the resources available to them in meeting the needs ofthe communities they serve.Need for Safeguards53. Local authorities necessarily hold information about individuals,although much of it is anonymous or not confidential. Information whicha local authority collects for one service can be useful for another. Forexample, statistics derived from birth records held in health departments have been used to forecast school populations. The scope for using for onepurpose information which has been collected for another is likely to increase as local authorities move towards corporate management and set up generalinformation systems. In these circumstances it is clear that the need forconfidentiality of personal information is, and must continue to be, animportant consideration in the development of computerised informationsystems. This point has already been emphasised in advice to local authorities by the Department of the Environment.Existing Safeguards54. Local authorities have for long been used to holding personal information,and protecting its confidentiality. In particular, officers are charged in theirrules and conditions of service not to communicate the contents of any document to the public unless required by law or explicitly authorised to do
so. Local authorities are chosen by their electorates and are accountable tothem for standards of administration in their area. To help the membersof local authorities to maintain such standards, the Local Government Acts1974 (England and Wales) and 1975 (Scotland) provide for the appointmentof local Commissioners for Administration, who have a role similar in localgovernment to that of the Parliamentary Commissioner for administration in central government. They have the power to investigate complaints aboutalleged maladministration by local authorities, including breaches of privacyin the handling of personal information, and they are able to report on their investigations.55. The McKinsey report found that local authorities in general were veryaware of their responsibility for protecting sensitive data, and that arrange-ments for preserving confidentiality and security had resulted in relatively few complaints of breaches. Nevertheless, policies and practices variedbetween local authorities, and the arrangements in some authorities wouldbe regarded by others as abusing confidentiality or security. There was as yet little consensus on the extent to which the development of computerisedmanagement information systems should be limited to preserve confidentiality.The report concluded that unless agreement was reached on the guidelinesneeded to control developments, some authorities were likely to miss oppor-tunities for realising significant benefits, while others would run the risk of releasing information improperly.56. Some steps have been taken towards the achievement of a commonapproach to standards and safeguards through the advisory service given bythe Local Authorities Management Services and Computer Committee which,among other publications, has issued &quot; Computer Privacy: Notes of Guidancefor Local Authorities &quot;. This covers, among other things, the collection,organisation and storage of data, the restriction of access to computers andterminals to guard against unauthorised use, and the safeguarding of printedoutput from computers. Local authorities generally have found this adviceuseful.Conclusion57. The processing and storage of information in local government computersare, therefore, already subject to a variety of safeguards and, as McKinsey and company found, local authorities generally are well aware of their responsi-bilities in this field. But, as with computers used by central government andby other organisations, there can be no room for complacency. The proposals contained in the White Paper * will reinforce the protection already available,and will help to ensure that the consistently increasing use of computers bylocal authorities, itself desirable in terms of efficient administration, will not result in any increased danger to privacy.6. Nationalised Industry Computers58. The nationalised industries hold billing details for some 90 millionaccounts in their computers. These may include licence details (as, forexample, in the Post Office or British Waterways) as well as the details usuallyrequired for securing payment for services rendered and for credit control.* Cmnd. 6353.
59. Individual industries also hold their own specialised types of personalrecords. For example, the gas industry holds personal records about thework of converting appliances to natural gas, the Post Office holds GIRO &apos;records, and British Airways holds airline booking details. In addition, those industries which own houses (e.g. the National Coal Board) either have or aredeveloping computerised rent systems. It is normal for all nationalised industries to hold purchase and sales ledger information on computers.60. According to the Nationalised Industries Computer Committee,* oneof the main effects of putting personal records on computers has been to allowauthorisation procedures to be made stricter and easier to control, thus renderingaccess more difficult. In addition, the computer systems are designed toinclude built-in security codes and to provide for the maximum of anonymityat each stage. They also specify the periods beyond which information maynot be retained.61. Certain nationalised industries and other public authorities are subjectto statutory restrictions on the disclosure of information to third parties. Insome cases for example the Post Office Corporation, the Atomic energy authority and the Civil Aviation Authority -the Officials Secrets Acts continueto apply as they did before these bodies ceased to be Government Departments.In the case of the Post Office Corporation there is also a specific provision insection 65 of the Post Office Act 1969 which imposes obligations of secrecyon all employees in its Data Processing Service. It provides specific penalties for infringements, which are made known to the employees. Other industries are subject to restrictions imposed by the legislation which created them.62. Disclosure of information to the individual concerned is, of course, a regular (although only an incidental) feature of the operation of industrieslike gas, coal and electricity. In the course of a year a good deal of theinformation which these industries hold about a customer is copied to him in some form or other. The customer therefore has an opportunity to checkits accuracy.7. Computer Use and Procedures in UK63. Published figures give some idea of the scale of computer use, but thesegive little direct evidence of implications for the privacy of personal information.Many of the computers used in the UK are small and either do not have thefacilities or are used in such a way that the creation and maintenance of largepersonal files is unlikely. Nonetheless, there are several thousands of computersystems used for purposes which might impinge directly on privacy. Thereis no single source of complete statistics of all computers used in the UK.The National Computer Index contains detailed records of 13,263 computersoperational in the UK in April 1975. Table 4 analyses this figure. It classifiesthe industries using computers into very broad categories, and the conclusions* The Committee, which represents all the nationalised industries, provides a forum fordiscussion and advises on the use of computers in this part of the public sector. It supersededin 1970 the Nationalised Industries Electronic Data Processing Committee which had beenestablished in 1959.
which can be drawn from it are therefore limited. But the table does showthat in the private sector (outside the manufacturing and construction industries in which personal information apart from staff and pay records will not normally be found), most computers are in SIC *category XXIV &quot; Insurance,Banking and Business Services&quot; where 4,499 computers are recorded. Thisis the category of computer use which, on the face of it, may be expected tohave most implications for privacy, since business organisations in this fieldtend to hold financial information about individuals which is usually regardedas sensitive, even though not all computers in this category will necessarily beused to handle personal information.64. The National Computer Index also provides some information aboutthe nature of the tasks for which computers are used. Table 5 is an analysis of this information by user industry, showing those applications which maybe thought to have some relevance to the question of privacy. By far thelargest single category of computer applications recorded in this table concernswage, salary and pension records (2,758 out of some 10,862 applicationsrecorded). Other sizeable uses are for sales statements (1,856) and creditcontrol (1,342). Many of these applications seem likely to involve the use of personal information to a greater or lesser extent, but, like Table 4, this analysisalso only has a rough and ready value.Surveys of Computer Use65. The Younger Committee was not able to attempt any factual analysis of computer use in the private sector; nor could it provide any assessment of the efficiency of the safeguards already in existence to protect the privacyof personal information. Since the Younger Report was published, however,there have been two separate studies of computer use, both of which have provided some useful information. The first was a survey conducted by theBritish Computer Society of some 44 large organisations using computers;the second was a wider study of security in computer systems carried out under the auspices of the National Computing Centre Limited.66. The Privacy and Public Welfare Committee of the British ComputerSociety was looking at the problem of privacy and the computer while the younger Committee was sitting and, like the Younger Committee, founditself short of &quot; hard &quot; information about computer use in the private sector.To correct that situation, the BCS Committee sent a questionnaire to 56 largeorganisations between August 1972 and January 1973. An analysis of the44 organisations which replied has been published by the Society.t Notsurprisingly, the survey showed that the amount of personal information heldabout people is increasing and that computers have made it easier to holdsuch information. But it also showed that much of the information thoughtby respondents to be sensitive was still held manually and there was little evidence of the exchange or transfer of such information between organisations.The report also notes that &quot; very few organisations seem at the moment to be* Standard Industrial Classification.t Analysis of the questionnaire on Privacy, obtainable from the British Computer Society,29 Portland Place, London WIN 4AP, price  1-50.
correlating information.&quot; Organisations varied a good deal in the amountof attention which they devoted to privacy (as distinct from security) questions,and the Committee thought that there was a need for greater awareness inthis area. But the report concluded that the results of the survey indicated that organisations generally were aware of the potential problems of security and that it was probable that they were taking a good deal more care withcomputer-held information than they had done previously with manual filingsystems.67. The necessarily Survey of computer use was addressed to those who make use of computers in all parts of the private and public sectors. It was designedto consider all aspects of the security of computer systems from the point ofview of financial control, commercial confidentiality and statutory requirements,as well as the privacy of personal information. Questionnaires were sent toorganisations known or thought to be using computers and, in each case, the questionnaire was addressed to a &quot; user &quot; of computer services within theorganisation, as well as to the head of the data-processing unit. Over150 organisations agreed to take part in the survey. Some of the questionnaireswere followed up by interviews, designed to elicit attitudes to security andprivacy, as well as to provide factual information about the safeguards already in force. The results of the survey * agree with the BCS finding that thoseorganisations which hold information which they regard as confidential go toa good deal of trouble to look after it. Indeed, this is often as much in theirown interests as it is in the interests of those to whom the information relates.68. As a result of recommendations put forward in that report, necessarily hasinitiated a series of projects designed to increase knowledge and unstanding of security, and has established a central reference body to provide computerusers and manufacturers with information and guidance about security measures.This central reference body is advised by a committee whose members represent,between them, all sections of the computer industry. The Governmentwelcome this initiative, and are glad to note the efforts being made by theNCC, and members of the industry themselves, to make computer systemsincreasingly secure, and therefore less vulnerable to threats which couldendanger privacy.* Where Next for Computer Security: A National Study Group Report, N.C.C.

The figures quoted in this table are extracted from the National Computer Index usinginformation contained in the April 1975 updating. The National Computer Index does notclaim to include all computers in the UK. There may be 40,000 of these in total, but manyof them will be small. It is believed that about 75 per cent of capital investment in computersin the UK is represented by the installation included in the National Computer Index.2. The accuracy of the Index is continually improving, so that the difference betweencurrent and previous figures may not be wholly due to growth, but may be the result of more accurate information being currently available.3. For the purpose of this table, certain computer installations are regarded as being inthe private sector, whereas they are in fact publicly owned for example, transport.

8. Studies and Practices Abroad69. The threat to privacy from computers handling personal information has been recognised in many other countries. The solutions devised vary,for they must inevitably take account of local factors such as the constitutional and institutional structures of the country concerned, its history, its cultureand its traditional public attitudes. But, nevertheless, there is a great deal to be learned from all the work which has been done abroad; and the mostimportant of the foreign studies, legislative proposals, and statutes in force are summarised below.United States of America70. In the United States, public anxiety about computers and privacy hasbeen articulate and widespread for a number of years. It was investigated,in connection with a proposal for a National Data Centre, by a sub-committeeof the House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations aslong ago as 1966-67, and by a sub-committee on Administrative Practice and procedure of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in the following year.It has been investigated by many others since then.71. Of these investigations, two in particular deserve mention here. unlike the Younger Committee&apos;s enquiry, they were carried out by committees havingexpert knowledge of computers; but like the Younger Committee, their investigations also resulted in proposals for action which included one ormore sets of &quot; principles &quot; for the operation of computers to safeguard the accuracy and privacy of personal information stored in them.72. The first of these was a Report^) to the Committee on Scientific andTechnical Information (COSATI) of the U.S. Government^ federal council of Science and Technology, prepared by its Panel on Legal Aspectsof Information Systems. A summary of the &quot; principles &quot; to be extracted from this Report is to be found in Table 6.73. The second was the Report(2), published in July 1973, of the AdvisoryCommittee on Automated Personal Data Systems appointed by the U.S.Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (the HEW Report). ThisReport recommended the enactment of a Federal &quot; Code of Fair InformationPractice &quot; for all automated personal data systems. The Code rests on fivebasic principles which would be given legal effect as &quot; safeguard requirements &quot;for such systems.  These &quot; principles &quot; are set out in Table 7.74. Following these recommendations, a number of Bills were introduced in the Congress. After much debate, one of them the Privacy Act 1974 was passed and became law on 1st January 1975. It operates by placingupon all Federal agencies stringent requirements to identify their record-keeping systems each year, and publish descriptiveinformation about them;(1) Published in The Honeywell Computer Journal, Vol. 7 (1973), No. 1.(2) DHEW Publication No. (OS) 73-97.
 limit their record keeping to that which is lawful, relevant and necessary; inform individuals who are asked to provide information by whatauthority they are asked, the purpose for which the information7 is being collected, the use to which it will be put, and the legalimplications of not providing it; permit individuals to examine records relating to them, and to corrector amend them; ensure such accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completeness of recordsas is necessary to ensure fairness to the individual, and make reasonableefforts to meet these standards before any record is disclosed; restrict to a few specified cases the disclosure of records without theconsent of the individual concerned.Failure to perform these obligations will entitle the individual affected to suethe agency in the courts, and there are criminal sanctions against officials who knowingly and wilfully violate the provisions of the Act. In addition,the Act sets up a Privacy Protection Study Commission to consider what further legislation may be required.Council of Europe75. The United Kingdom is a founder member of the Council of Europe.The Committee of Ministers of that organisation has recently adopted twoResolutions which recommend to the Governments of all its member statesthat, for the protection of the privacy of personal information in computers,they should give effect to the &quot; principles &quot; set out in the Resolutions.Resolution (73) 22, adopted on 26 September 1973, sets out principles to be implemented for computers in the private sector. These are reproduced in Table 8.Resolution (74) 29, adopted on 29 September 1974, sets out principles to be implemented for computers in the public sector. These are reproduced in Table 9.Other Countries76. In West Germany, the Land Hesse passed a Data Protection Law in1970, which imposes direct obligations on all data banks in the public sector,subject to criminal sanctions, and places their enforcement under the super-vision of a single and independent Data Protection Officer. A similar DataProtection Law, with civil as well as criminal sanctions, has also been in forcein the Land Rhineland Palatinate for over a year. In other Lander, notablyLower Saxony, administrative regulations controlling public sector databanks have been made. In 1973, the Federal Government presented a compre-hensive Data Protection Bill, covering both the, public and the private sector,to the Federal Parliament, where it is currently being debated. The bill provides criminal sanctions for breach of its provisions.
77. In Sweden, a Data Act was passed in 1973. Under this, no data banksholding personal information may be maintained in the public or the private sector except with the permission, and under the supervision of, a DataInspection Board which has wide powers to control their operations by makingregulations. There are civil and criminal sanctions for breach. The only,&apos;exceptions to this rule are data banks established according to a decision bythe King or Parliament, but the views of the Data Inspection Board must besought before any such decision is taken; and the Board is required to issueregulations for the operation of such data banks if the King or parliament has not made any.78. In Austria, the Government have recently presented a draft Data Protec-tion Law to Parliament which, like the Federal German one, would imposedirect obligations on all data banks in the public and private sectors. these obligations would be supervised and enforced by an independent DataProtection Commission, and there are criminal sanctions.79. In New Zealand, a sub-committee of the Law Revision Commissionpublished a report in April 1973 on Computer Data Banks and Privacy. Thisrecommended legislation to set up an independent agency to investigate,appraise and inspect computer data banks in both the public and private sectors and to make recommendations. The New Zealand Government have promised legislation this year.80. In Denmark, a Committee set up by the Government has completed itsstudy of the private sector and recommended legislation in the form of a draftBill which would set up a registration board and impose wide obligations onall data banks in the private sector, enforced by criminal sanctions. TheCommittee is now investigating the public sector.81. In Norway, two Bills, dealing respectively with the public and private sectors, have been presented by Royal Commissions. They would imposedirect obligations on ail data banks, whether or not they are computerised,and establish a Data Surveillance Service. For the private sector, there wouldbe both civil and criminal sanctions.82. In the Netherlands, a Committee of experts set up by the Governmentpublished an Interim Report in 1974, recommending that, as a first step, thereshould be statutory registration of all data banks, and a legal right for allindividuals to inspect and correct their records. The Committee also recom-mended the introduction of a licensing system after further study of thenecessary details. Meanwhile, in March of this year, the Government issuedstringent directives for the operation of its own computer systems.83. In Canada, a Task Force established jointly by the Federal departments of Communications and Justice reported in 1972 and discussed various possiblestatutory measures. Draft legislation is being considered by the canadian parliament.
84. In France, a Commission on Data Processing and Freedom, appointedby the President of the Republic in November 1974, has recently published itsReport. It recommends the creation of a new independent agency to functionas a kind of social conscience in relation to data processing, with certain powersof control. It also recommends certain constraints, in both the public and&quot;the private sector, on the collection and storage of personal data, and thecreation of a right for individuals and associations to know and to criticise the data stored about them.85. Preparations for legislation are also being made in Belgium, Finland,the Irish Republic and Spain.
Summary of the Principles Recommended in the Cosati report . In gathering information from individual citizens, agencies have an obligationto disclose to them the purpose for which the information is being collected, to stateclearly the use or uses to which it will be put, to identify the individuals and&apos;-&apos;organisations that will be given access to it, and to indicate whether the individualsname will be associated, either directly or indirectly, with the information.2. Unless disclosure is required by law, personal information must never be extracted from an individual without securing his informed, express consent.3. When personal information of any degree of sensitivity is collected from sourcesother than the data subject himself, the data collector is always under an obligationto verify its accuracy. If this is impossible, it is necessary to indicate the source ofinformation, the fact that it has not been verified, and why it could not be verified.4. Every agency has an obligation not to engage in repetitious information-gatheringexercises.5. When data are transferred by one agency to, or exchanged with, another, thenature of the data-originating agency&apos;s understanding with the individual must bebrought to the remote user&apos;s attention and he must be obligated to honour it.6. Particular attention must be paid to information stored in a remote-accesssystem, to protect individualised information from improper access through the network.In addition, the security of personal information transmitted from point to pointmust be guaranteed. Even in systems that do not have remote access features,procedures must be established for ensuring the physical security of data files againstimproper intrusion, or destruction.7. When the legitimate needs of the information-gathering agency require data tobe put to uses or to be disclosed to people beyond the scope of the understandingentered into with the subject at the time the information was originated, a new under-standing should be entered into with the individual unless circumstances make thisimpossible.8. An individual data subject should be granted access to the information recordedabout him and procedures should be established that enable him to ensure the accuracy of the information and to determine whether his files have been abused. This will necessitate establishing and giving him access to monitoring logs that show who hassought access to his files and for what purpose.9. Each agency should engage in a periodical review of its files to ascertain whenpersonal information should be expunged, placed in a form of storage that is lessaccessible, or archived. Archival data should never be released to the public until asufficient period has elapsed so that there is no longer any possibility of injury to any individual. When an agency determines that personal information is no longer ofutility, and should be destroyed in the interest of privacy and file confidentiality, thatdecision should be communicated to any other agency and any private individual organisation that has received a copy of the data, and a requirement made that saidcopy, or any other copies that may have been made, be likewise destroyed. This willrequire that an agreement for such disposition at the request of the issuing agencybe obtained before such personal information is made available.10. Individual citizens should be given the right to request the expungement of personal information that is maintained in an agency file when there is no expressstatute or regulation requiring its preservation.II. The responsibility of implementing these principles should be given to personnelwho are not associated with the day-to-day operation of the system and they shouldbe expressly charged with the responsibility to make certain that they are honoured.
TABLE 7The Principles of the Hew report. There must be no personal data record-keeping systems whose very existence issecret.2. There must be a way for an individual to find out what information about himis in a record and how it is used.3. There must be a way for an individual to prevent information about him thatwas obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for other purposeswithout his consent.4. There must be a way for an individual to correct or amend a record of identifiableinformation about him.5. Any organisation creating, maintaining, using, or disseminating records ofidentifiable personal data must assure the reliability of the data for their intendeduse and must take precautions to prevent misuse of the data.TABLE 8Principles Recommended by the Council of Europe for the PrivateSector1. The information stored should be accurate and should be kept up to date. Ingeneral, information relating to the intimate private life of persons or information which might lead to unfair discrimination should not be recorded or, if recorded,should not be disseminated.2. The information should be appropriate and relevant with regard to the purpose for which it has been stored.3. The information should not be obtained by fraudulent or unfair means.4. Rules should be laid down to specify the periods beyond which certain categories of information should no longer be kept or used.5. Without appropriate authorisation, information should not be used for purposes other than those for which it has been stored, nor communicated to third parties.6. As a general rule, the person concerned should have the right to know theinformation stored about him, the purpose for which it has been recorded, andparticulars of each release of this information.7. Every care should be taken to correct inaccurate information and to eraseobsolete information or information obtained in an unlawful way.8. Precautions should be taken against any abuse or misuse of information.Electronic data banks should be equipped with security systems which bar access tothe data held by them to persons not entitled to obtain such information, and which provide for the detection of misdirections of information, whether intentional ornot.9. Access to the information stored should be confined to persons who have a validreason to know it.The operating staff of the electronic data banks should be bound by rules of conductaimed at preventing the misuse of data, and, in particular, by rules of professionalsecrecy.10. Statistical data should be released only in aggregate form and in such a way that it is impossible to link the information to a particular person.
Principles Recommended by the Council of Europe for the PublicSector1. As a general rule the public should be kept regularly informed about theestablishment, operation and development of electronic data banks in the public -sector.2. The information stored should be:(a) obtained by lawful and fair means;(6) accurate and kept up to date;(c) appropriate and relevant to the purpose for which it has been stored.Every care should be taken to correct inaccurate information and to erase inappropriate-priate, irrelevant or obsolete information.3. Especially when electronic data banks process information relating to theintimate private life of individuals or when the processing of information might leadto unfair discrimination (a) their existence must have been provided for by law, or by special regulationor have been made public in a statement or document, in accordance withthe legal system of each member state;(6) such law, regulation, statement or document must clearly state the purposeof storage and use of such information, as well as the conditions underwhich it may be communicated either within the public administration orto private persons or bodies;(c) the data stored must not be used for purposes other than those which havebeen defined unless exception is explicitly permitted by law, is granted by a competent authority or the rules for the use of the electronic data bank areamended.4. Rules should be laid down to specify the time limits beyond which certain categories of information may not be kept or used.However, exceptions from this principle are acceptable if the use of the information for statistical, scientific or historical purposes requires its conservation for an indefinite duration. In that case, precautions should be taken to ensure that theprivacy of the individuals concerned will not be prejudiced.5. Every individual should have the right to know the information stored abouthim.Any exception to this principle or limitation to the exercise of this right should be strictly regulated.6. Precautions should be taken against any abuse or misuse of information. Forthis reason:(a) everyone concerned with the operation of the electronic data processingshould be bound by rules of conduct aimed at preventing the misuse of dataand in particular by a duty to observe secrecy;(b) electronic data banks should be equipped with security systems which baraccess to the data held by them to persons not entitled to obtain such information and which provide for the detection of misdirections of informa-tion, whether intentional or not.7. Access to information that may not be freely communicated to the public shouldbe confined to the persons whose functions entitle them to take cognizance of it inorder to carry out their duties.8. When information is used for statistical purposes it should be released only insuch a way that it is impossible to link information to a particular person.Printed in England for Her Majesty*s Stationery Office by Oyez Press LimitedDdl41843     K48     12/75ISBN 0 10 163540 0
