DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government(75) 140 COPY NO2 December 1975CABINETCHRYSLER:  SPECIAL REDUNDANCY scheme memorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. The Secretary of State for Industry will be reporting the results ofour discussions with trade union representatives.    The difficulties they saw in the possibility of keeping a part of the Chrysler operation goingprompted them to raise the question of a publicly financed redundancyscheme in the event of a complete closure of Chrysler,2. I earlier favoured the idea of making up unemployment pay and earnings in jobs secured by the redundant Chrysler workers,    I have come round to thinking that a scheme of supplementary lump sum paymentsmight be preferable :-i. It could be done under cover of the Appropriation Actwhereas a scheme of continuing payments would commit us to legislation taking wide powers to make such payments.    Thatwould expose us to pressure to use the powers for other workers.It is not a matter on which we should take a snap decision.ii. We shall defend a special scheme for Chrysler workers on the ground that this is a quite exceptionally large redundancycreating unusual problems for the reabsorption of the workers concerned into alternative employment.    We shall be less exposed to continuing complaints from other workers by a once-for-alllump sum scheme than by a scheme of make-up payments continuedover a long period.    Moreover make-up of unemployment benefitcould generate pressure for a general increase in benefit,iii. Chrysler could make the additional lump sum payments as our agent when they make the statutory lump sum payments totheir redundant workers.    This would obviate the need for settingup our own administrative machinery.
3. Before finalising a decision on the precise content of a specialredundancy scheme, we should need to consult the unions but I should liketo enter into such a consultation on the basis that the Government favoured a scheme of lump sum payments,,    An announcement that we intended toprovide money for a supplementary scheme could leave open the questionof its precise form and content,4. There is the further question of whether an announcement shouldspecify the amount of money we are prepared to make available.    Infavour is the argument that naming a figure - eg  30 million - would havea greater impact.    Against is the fact that any figure would become afloor for negotiation and that we cannot judge what the right level shouldbe until we have got further with the unions.    For instance, it would notbe easy to spend  30 million on a scheme restricted to the supplementationof unemployment pay and subsequent earnings,     30 million would provide an additional lump sum of  1200 on average for the redundant workers on top of an average statutory payment of  600.    On the whole I am inclinednot to mention a figure in an initial announcement.5. I attach a draft of the relevant part of an announcement,6. In my view, no special redundancy scheme would be justified ifpublic money is provided to preserve a significant part of the Chrysleroperation.7. I invite my colleagues, in the event of our deciding to allowChrysler to close down completely, to agree that;-i. In principle up to  30 million should be made availablefor a special redundancy scheme.ii. An announcement should be made in the terms attached.iii. Following the announcement, I should enter intoconsultations with the unions on the basis that the Governmentfavoured a scheme providing supplementary lump sum payments.M department of Employment2 December 19752
(secret)annex  PASSAGE FOR AN ANNOUNCEMENT ABOUT CHRYSLERThe close-down of Chrysler will mean the loss of 26,000 jobs ata time when unemployment generally is very high.,    Moreover,  7?000of the jobs lost will be at Linwood in an area where unemployment has been consistently high for many years.    So many redundanciesat once will raise the unemployment rate considerably in the two areas principally affected,  the Coventry and Paisley travel-to-workareas.    The Government has,  therefore,  decided that in view of the exceptional size of these redundancies and the unusual degree of hardship they will cause,  it will make the money available to finance a special redundancy scheme,  in supplementation of thestatutory payments which will be made by the Chrysler company.Urgent action will be needed by Government Departments and by the manpower Services Commission to find alternative work for the redundant workers,  to retrain them if necessary,  and to encourage the establishment of new work in the areas concerned.    TheGovernment will ensure that all concerned tackle this with theutmost speed and vigour.
