RESTRICTEDDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS government(75) 13425 November 1975CABINETWHITE PAPER ON COMPUTERS AND PRIVACYNote by the Secretary of State for the Home department. I am circulating for the information of my colleagues the attached draft of a White Paper and supplementary report on computers andprivacy.    These represent the first instalment of our proposals toincrease the protection for personal privacy, following the report of the younger Committee in 1972.    The text is that approved by the HomeAffairs Committee with two modifications.    I have added words to paragraph 4 to indicate that in the timing and content of the legislationenvisaged in the paper account will have to be taken of finance and manpowerconsiderations.    This is to meet a point made by the Chancellor of theExchequer, the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Lord privy seal.    Secondly, for reasons of security I have deleted from the supplementary report statements of the geographical location of Governmentcomputer installations.?,. The White Paper is long overdue and I propose to send the textto the printer at the end of the week.R H j home Office25 November 1975COPY NO        31RESTRICTED
COMPUTERS AND PRIVACYDRAPT WHITE PAPER.Hone Office    .Whitehall, S.W.1mm
computers and privacyIntroduction1,       For some years now there has been increasing concern - in this country asin others - about actual or potential threats to the privacy of the individual,part of this concern has arisen from the rapid growth in the use of computers, withtheir capacity for the swift processing and collation of information, includingpersonal information.   The Committee on Privacy under the chairmanship of+Sir Kenneth Younger, which reported in 1972 , had this to say about computers:&quot;We cannot on the evidence before us conclude that the computer as usedin the private sector is at present a threat to privacy, but we recognisethat there is a possibility of such a threat becoming a reality in thefuture.&quot;   (Paragraph 619)2,      In parallel with the Younger Committee&apos;s inquiry into the private sector,the Government reviewed the categories of information held, or likely to be held,in the computer systems of Government Departments, and the rules governing its storage and use.   The results of this review, complemented by comparable information obtainedscout the use of computers in other parts of the public sector, are given in a Report4published as a supplement to this White Paper.   That Report discloses no evidence[to suggest that fears about the improper use of computers in the public sector are justified by present practice.   These systems are operated in accordance withadministrative rules and procedures which provide substantial safeguards againstjthe realisation of any such fears.I.      These findings, covering both the private and public sectors, should go along way towards reassuring the public about the past, the present, and the immediatefuture.   But the capabilities of computers are undoubtedly such as to give grounds for concern, and the potential threat which they pose to privacy could be transformedinto a real one.   It was the potential rather than the actual threat that led thehunger Committee to recommendJfcnmd 5012rCmnd  The Report also contains details of the number of computers in use in GreatBritain, and discusses studies and regulations abroad.
&quot;The Government should legislate to provide itself with machinery for keepingwider review the growth in and techniques of gathering personal information; arci orocessing it with the help of computers,   Such machinery should take theI fonn of an independent body with members drawn from both the computer worldr;:;i outside.   For the sake of convenience, we call it here a Standing Commission&quot;! (Paragraph 621)19 Committee added that their investigation was limited to the private sector, butiat the Government should consider including both the public and private sectorsithin the purview of the Standing Commission,The Government have concluded that there is need for legislation to be introducedo Set up machinery, not only to keep the situation under review, but also to seek toecure that all existing and future computer systems in which personal information is laid, in both the private and public sectors, are operated with appropriate safeguardsjpr the privacy of the subject of that information.   Their wish would be to introducehis legislation as soon as the preparatory work is completed and the Parliamentarytestable allows, although clearly considerations of finance and manpower must enternto the calculation of the timing and content of the measure.ie problemh?.t is special about computers?j,   None of the functions carried out by computers within an information system is different in kind from those which are, or could in principle be, carried out bytraditional methods.   But there are important differences in the way, and the speedat which, those functions can be performed by computer systems on the one hand, andby traditional systems on the other0it   The speed of computers, their capacity to store, combine, retrieve and transferiat a, their flexibility, and the low unit cost of the work, which they can do havethe following practical implications for privacy:(l)  Theyfacilitate the maintenance of extensive record systems and theretention of data in those systems)(2)  They can make data easily and quickly accessible from many distant points?(3)  They make it possible for data to be transferred quickly from oneinformation system to another!- 2 -RESTRICTED -
ICO   They make it possible for data to be combined in ways which might not otherwise be practicable;(5)   Because the data are stored, processed and often transmitted in a form which is not directly intelligible, few people may know what is in the records, or what is happening to them.Benefits and dangers7,      How computers affect people&apos;s lives depends on how they are used - or abused.Their actual and potential benefits are great:   in the saving of routine clericalwork;   in the economy, accuracy and speed with which information can be processed;1 in forecasting, planning, or matching supply to demand;   and, in the service of central and local government, in making public administration more responsive to[ the needs of the individual citizen and his family.   It is clearly of the first importance that we should exploit to the full the benefits which computers can offer.It is against those benefits that we must weigh the possible threats.   For, like other powerful tools that man has devised, computers have the capacity to do harmI if they are misused.8.      The principal potential dangers to privacy come from three main sources:(1)   inaccurate, incomplete or irrelevant information;(2)   the possibility of access to information by people who should not orneed not have it;(3)   the use of information in a context or for a purpose other than that1 for which it was collected.pi Any of these dangers can come about either intentionally, or by accident, and properlydesigned safeguards must therefore provide against both eventualities.i -^Sggy.,t. completeness and relevance5*      A competently designed computer system imposes disciplines on every stageln the processing of data v/hich help to reduce mistakes and to ensure that thosel;ei&apos;rors which do occur are detected and corrected.   This does not mean that computers- 3 -
B&apos;-/ill not make mistakes, but when they do, it will almost always be because some humanLing has made a mistake in the first place - perhaps by feeding the wrong datainto the system, or by making an error in the instructions (the &quot;program&quot;) givenSto the computer.   If the mistake is in the program, it will not recur once the programhas been corrected.10,     It is equally important that information should be complete.   In one sense,all information is incomplete since there are always other facts and circumstances which may be relevant to it.   But information can be so incomplete as to be positivelynisleading;    for example, to say that a bankruptcy petition was presented againsta given individual on a given day may be perfectly accurate, but it v/ould be mis-,leading if the computer record did not show that the petition was dismissed withcosts a fortnight later.11,     The capacity of computers to store data in quantity could encourage thecollection and storage of more data than is strictly necessary for the task in hand.Long term storage is cheap, whereas updating and selective erasure may be expensive.However, it is possible to build into the system procedures which will remove outof date or unnecessary data.12.     In many cases, the best way of ensuring the accuracy, completeness and relevanceof personal information would be to give the people concerned the opportunity of checking and correcting the records held about them.   But there are difficulties to be overcome.   First, the people must know that the information system exists,and that it holds information about them.   Secondly, there must be some verificationprocedure to ensure that the information is given only to the people concerned, andto nobody else.   The cost of providing these facilities may be high, particularly if the system was not originally designed to provide them.Access to, and use of, information13.     Access to information should be restricted to what is necessary.   Restrictingaccess to information stored in a computer is a matter of security procedures.
These should be designed to ensure that access is only possible for authorisedpersons, and that they can process data only in an authorised way.    Safeguardingprivacy also requires, however, that those who do have authorised access to informationdo not breach the confidence in which it was obtained.The very complexity of computers and their operations creates problems foranyone who tries to gain unauthorised access to them.   In practice, the person makingthe attempt would need access to the machine or its associated punchcards, tapes,discs or other forms of memory store;    in addition, he would need either himself to be an experienced computer technician, or to have the help of one or more experts,probably from within the system he is trying to penetrate.   Unauthorised entry tothe information store of a computer by someone who is not himself an expert is afar more complicated, difficult and expensive exercise than raiding a file of papers.15.     Where data are printed out in human readable form, computer based systemsshare the security weaknesses of manual systems.   But the use of computers allowsthose in charge of the system to decide how much information should be made availablein this way - an option which is less directly available to the manager of a traditionalsystem.   Also, the physical concentration of e computer print-out in a small areacan increase the opportunity for its effective protection.gonfidentiality16.     Where someone with authorised access to information uses that information for an improper purpose, it is a breach of confidence.   This is a risk which is asold as information itself;   it applies both to computer and traditional systems,and our law already provides a number of remedies for it, some of which are currently being considered by the Law Commissions following a recommendation of the YoungerCommittee*.   The additional fear that arises from the development of computers isthat someone will make improper use of the computer&apos;s capacity for storing, processingi*See Breach of Confidence, Law Commission Working Paper No 58;   HMSO 197^-- 5 -
and transferring data so as to combine information from a number of sources aboutindividuals without their knowledge and consent.17,     As the Supplementary Report to this White Paper makes clear, personal informationheld on Government computers is not misused in this way;   and the Younger Committeefound no evidence of improper combination of information about individuals in theorivate sector.   Steps must be taken to ensure that this continues to be so throughoutthe public and private sectors.   However, some limited linkage of data from differentsystems for administrative or statistical purposes (or both) may be justified subjectto proper safeguards, and the Supplementary Report to this White Paper gives detailsof cases where this happens within central government.   Measures to protect privacynust seek to ensure that operations of that kind are not authorised or undertakenunless they are expressly sanctioned by law or agreement, or are subject to the scrutiny and control of some independent body which has a duty to safeguard theprivacy of the individual.18,     The confidentiality of personal information held in a computer system canof course also be put at risk through accident, carelessness or sheer lack of foresight.In practice, that is the way in which confidentiality - and also accuracy - arecost likely to be compromised in the foreseeable future.   Any computer system whichis properly designed and operated must therefore ensure that risks of this kindhave been foreseen, and that adequate safeguards are maintained to obviate them.StatisticsP9.     One of the areas where great benefits can be derived from the use of computersis statistics.   These are of great importance to industry (public and private) andto central and local government.   Compared with a traditional system, the computercan greatly enhance the quality of statistics, thereby improving one of the basesupon which most planning for the- future must rest.Statistical work carries few risks for privacy because it gives informationjabout groups of people, even though the original data related to identifiable- 6 -RESTRICTED
individuals.   There need be no risk to privacy in allowing information originally[ollecjted for some other purpose to be used for the compilation of statistics.   this c?n be justified because information is efficiently used without jeopardising theconfidence in which it was supplied.   What is important, however, is that the outputof statistics should guard against revealing information about identified or identifiableindividuals.   In many cases it may well be appropriate for the identifier in a com-\ pUterised statistical data system to be a code number which can only be related tothe particular individual by reference to an index which is kept secure outside the computer system.21,     Statistics play an essential part in research, particularly in such fieldsas medicine, personal social services, education and economics.   For example, thepredisposing factors of a disease can sometimes only be found by discovering whatelse those who suffer from it have in common.   To find or confirm the correlationson which much research of this kind is based, it will often be necessary to combinedata about the same people which are held in different systems.   In this kind of statistical data processing it is necessary to take special precautions againstrisks for the privacy of the individual, especially as the data may be very sensitiveindeed.22.     The Government believe that their own rules and procedures for statisticaloperations adequately meet the need to protect privacy, and are working on a set        . .of guidelines to codify them.Safeguards for privacy]23.     The earlier part of this White Paper has outlined the potential dangers toprivacy arising from the increasing use of computers.   Given proper safeguards, therejis no reason why these dangers should become a reality.   Information about the safe-guards which are already in force in the public sector is set out in the supplementary report to this White Paper;   and many of these can be - and are - applied in theprivate sector too.   Safeguards for security begin with traditional and obvious-7-
pones, such as the physical security of computer centres, limiting access to them,looks and keys (physical or electronic) for terminals, and so on.    Confidentialitycan be protected by managerial methods, such as limiting the information flow throughthe system, and deciding in advance who shall have access to which data.   Increasingly,however, the computer itself can be used to protect the security of the system ofwhich it forms part, and the confidentiality of the information which it contains.It can be programmed so as to limit access to certain data, or to require the useof a special password, or knowledge of a secret code, before the system can be entered.It can be programmed so that certain operations are forbidden and the system givesan alarm if anyone attempts to carry them out.   It can also be programmed to provideaudit information, logging all operations - or all operations of certain kinds -for subsequent inspection.   In short, the computer itself can be used to help toprotect the system of which it forms part,m,     The level of protection is limited only by the expense - in design effort,equipment costs and machine time - of installing and maintaining the security safe-guards.   The ultimate safeguard lies in the fact that it is nearly always possibleto make a system so expensive to break into that the cost of penetrating it willbe greater than the value of the information which it holds.   At the same time,the security systems which are most expensive to break tend also to be those whichare most expensive to instal.   The cost of providing the highest level of securitysifor all personal information systems would be enormous,   Fortunately, there is no need to do this:    the need is only to provide protection proportionate to the degreeof sensitivity of the information within the system.   In the long run some of thebeat protection lies in collecting only the minimum amount of information which thesystem needs to carry out its designed task efficiently, in erasing it when it isno longer needed, in keeping different information systems segregated from eachother, and above all in dealing honestly and openly with the subjects of the information.25t     Provided that there are adequate safeguards, the introduction of computersinto information systems need not therefore entail any dangers to privacy.   On- 8 -
the contrary, computer systems which are designed and operated with a proper regardL- the privacy of personal information can have many advantages over comparablepanual systems, not only in speed, cheapness, accuracy, flexibility and efficiency,but in the very protection which they can themselves provide againstcareless orunauthorised disclosures.26,     But all this v/ill only be so if proper safeguards are provided, and continueto be provided in the future.   Much of the information now going into computers -because it is eminently suitable for processing by computer - is regarded by most people as particularly sensitive:   medical records, criminal records, personal social services, education and work records, financial information and so on.   The publicis therefore entitled to have satisfactory assurances that its data - and especially those which are sensitive - are held and used responsibly, with due regard to accuracy,completeness, relevance, security and confidentiality.ACTION FOR THE FUTURE27.     It is against this background that the Government have considered what formthe necessary safeguards against the misuse of computers should take.   In formulatingtheir proposals, the Government have also taken account of the various studies whichhave been made of this subject in other countries, and which are described in the supplementary Report to this White Paper.28.     The Government have concluded that it would not be desirable, or practicable,to lay down by law detailed regulations for the operation of all computer systems.The best safeguards will vary between systems, and computer technology is still young,and is advancing all the time.   As the Younger Committee said,&quot;legislation cannotbe expected to spell out every detail, and many details will be beyond the manageable,scope even of subordinate legislation.&quot;   (paragraph 609).   An attempt to legislate in too much detail might well produce a statute which would be out of date as soona8 it came into force.
o.     Nor would it be enough merely to set up another non-statutory committee,ven if it included experts in the field, to keep developments under review anddvise whether legislation might be required in due course - and if so when and ofUat kind.jO,     In the Governments view the time has come when those who use computers to handle personal information, however responsible they are, can no longer remain the sole judges of whether their own systems adequately safeguard privacy.   the safeguards must become subject to independent scrutiny;   and independent scrutinyconnotes a declaration by law of the standards according to which the adequacy ofsafeguards in particular systems is to be judged.   The Government have therefore decided that the right course is to introduce legislation involving two elements:first the establishment of a set of objectives, to set standards governing the useof computers that handle personal information;   and second the establishment ofa permanent statutory agency to oversee the use of computers, in both the public and private sectors, to ensure that they are operated with proper regard for privacyand with the necessary safeguards for the personal information which they contain.31.     Legislation to establish this permanent machinery will inevitably take sometime, both to prepare and to enact.   The Government believe that it would be wrong to leave things as they are until this legislative process can be completed.   Itwill therefore appoint, at once, a non-statutory body whose function it will be toprepare the way for the setting up of the permanent machinery.   This interim bodywill be referred to here as the Data Protection Committee.Statutory Objectives32.     The objectives which the legislation will declare need not be enforceableBy civil or criminal processes.   But they must provide the standards by which the adequacy of safeguards for the privacy of the individual should be judged.   Therefore,theymust be more than mere declarations of broad principle and must set the standardsH^h a sufficient degree of particularity.   The range of computers holding personal-information, and the types of information held, are wide and varied, and no set of
ijjectives could be formulated which would be universally applicable.   For good andLlid reasons, particular systems will not be able to satisfy every objective, butefCh case of divergence should be a matter for independent appraisal.   The objectivesSuch the Government regard as desirable are set out in paragraph 34* but one of the tasks of the Data Protection Committee will be to refine these further if it considersthat more precise standards should be set.    In doing this the Committee will havefo balance the risk to the privacy of the individual in particular features of computeroperation against practical considerations, including considerations of coat, inorder that the obligations on computer users should be no more than proportionate to the degree of risk.   One important purpose of these objectives will be to supplyguidelines for the design of future systems,,33,  The general requirements for these statutory objectives are already apparent,end the ten principles recoamended by the Younger Committee for the private sector,and set out in Table 1, provide the starting point,   As the discussion in the supplementary Report on the studies carried out in other countries shows, the generaltendency has been to recommend sets of principles broadly in line with those formulated by the Younger Committees   The objectives to be declared in the statute should,therefore, cover very much the same ground,34* There can be no doubt that those responsible for holding personal information incomputers must be under an obligation to take all reasonable protective measures tojensure that the information cannot fall into the wrong hands, whether by design,inadvertence or deliberate penetration. It is obviously desirable that those who holdpersonal information in computers should not conceal the scops of their operations -particularly from those to whom the information relates. The existence and purpose ofI such information systems should therefore be publicly known, as well as the categories of data which they handle, what they do with data, and which interests have access todata, People asked to provide information should have a right to know for what purposesit will be used, and who is likely to have access to it.   The information should
not be used for a purpose other than one for which it was given or obtained withouteither the consent of the person whom it concerns, or some other authorised justifi-cation.   Only personal information v/hich is necessary for declared purposes shouldbe collected.   The operator of the system should be responsible for ensuring itsaccuracy and relevance, and the subject of the information should be able to satisfyhimself about this, which in many cases will best be achieved by giving him theopportunity to see it, check it and, if necessary, have it corrected.   The subjectihould also be able to find out what has been done with the information and to whom it has been given.   The information should be kept only for as long as it is needed.Safeguards are needed to ensure that statistics are presented in a v/ay which doeslot reveal details of an identified or identifiable individual.   Some of the objectives will apply to all systems, others may need modification in the light ofparticular circumstances.35,     Each of these objectives however raises the question how far those responsiblefor a computer system must go in supplying information.   Ideally the purpose and method of operation of the system, the rules about access, and the length of timefor which information is stored (to take only a few examples) should be known atleast to the subjects of the information and to those who are called upon to supplyinformation.   How far can these ideals be realised without disproportionate costs and without creating undue elaboration in administrative processes which computersiare meant to render simpler and more speedy?   What information can employersreasonably be expected to disclose to employees from&apos;personnel records held oncomputers and what may they reasonably withhold on management grounds?   And shouldcomputer users (and perhaps their informants) be entitled to the defence of qualifiedprivilege in defamation proceedings at the suit of a person who has been given accessSo information held about him?   Questions like these require further study and con-sultation before a set of statutory objectives can be stated with the degree ofparticularity that the situation demands.- 12 -RF-STRKJi fcl
I RESTRICTEDIjt^hntory AgencyThe second element in the legislation will be the establishment of a permanentpffgncy to oversee the use of computers that handle personal information.   This agency,which it will be convenient here to call the Data Protection Authority, will consistI of people with knowledge and experience of computers, and of representatives of theI 0tyi9r interests most closely affected by the Government&apos;s proposals, including the! general public.   Such a permanent and independent agency, with the necessary expertisei and continuous commitment to the subject, will have the required flexibility, thei ability to learn from experience, and the ability to evolve and (where necessary)to change its policies about the safeguards most suitable for different circumstances at different times.: 37,  Such an Authority will need powers to carry out its taks effectively.   Thereare at least two possible approaches:(l)    The Authority could be a registration and licensing agency, able toenforce registration of relevant details of the personal informationsystems within its jurisdiction, to prescribe safeguards for them, andto ensure (as a condition of the grant and renewal of licences whichwould be necessary before the systems could be maintained and operated)that those safeguards are instituted and observed.(2)    The Authority could be a body with power to call for information on what systems are being operated, by whom, how, and subject to v/hatsafeguards;   to make and publicise its own recommendations about thosesystems;   to investigate complaints and suspected malpractices;   andto publish its findings.
jnere are arguments for both of these choices.   Before the Government come to afinal decision they need further advice about the detailed implications of thetossible arrangements.   The Data Protection Committee will be asked to give this advice.   Its recommendations will be published, and the Government will announce their conclusions after a sufficient time to allow scope for public debate.    Thereare a number of other points to which the Data Protection Committee will be askedto rive their attention:   how far, for example, the protection for privacy thatthe statute will provide for individuals should extend to bodies and associations;what is to be regarded, for the purpose of the statutory control, as a &quot;computer&quot;and how personal information should be defined;   and what special arrangements arenecessary to deal with information supplied for computer records, not by the subjectof the information, but by a third party such as an employer, or from publishedrater ial.costs38.     Clearly, the measures needed to protect the confidentiality of personal information will entail some costs for society;   but equally clearly, it is essentialthat such expenditure should be kept to the minimum which will achieve the desiredresults.   In considering the organisation and powers of the proposed Authority, the data Protection Committee will therefore be asked to pay particular attention to the costs of the various alternatives.   The objective, whatever choice is finally adopted,i will be to make the Authority financially self-supporting, and the Committee will   -be asked to advise on how this can best be done.   It might, for example, be desirableto seek to recoup costs by levying certain fees and charges.   The Committee willalso need to bear in mind the additional expenditure which might be required bycomputer users in both the public and private sectors to ensure that their systemsincorporate the necessary safeguards.   In reaching its final decision on the content of the proposed legislation, the Government will take these matters fully intoaccount.
\a.     While the general principle will be that the purview of the Authority should extend throughout both the public and private sectors, there will need to be certain exceptions.   These will be as narrow as is consistent with the public interest.There mus^for example)be a procedure for exempting any computerised informationsystem which is kept for the strict purposes of national security, since that securitywould be jeopardised if the means of maintaining it were made public.   Exemptionson these grounds will require the personal certificate of the Home Secretary.jfo.     Exceptions will also be needed for some at least of the computer systems whichfacilitate the work of the police in the prevention and detection of crime.   their purpose could well be defeated if details about them were known to those againstwhose activities they are aimed, and it would certainly be defeated if the subjects of the information were entitled to know what data were held about them.   Suchexemptions will, however, require the certificate of the Home Secretary? the Secretaryof State for Scotland or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, who will havethe power to specify any additional safeguards which need to be observed in the systemconcerned.11.     Medical recoixls present a problem of a different kind.   As well as detailssupplied by the patient, medical records contain clinical information about thepatienfs treatment and care.   The doctor may not always consider it to be in thepatienfs best interest to have access to this information.   This factor should not affect the decision on what information is held in the computer but must be takeninto account when applying principles about the disclosure of information.jf2(     The Data Protection Committee will be asked to take full account of these considerations in framing its recommendations, and will be free to make recommendations about other professional records, including social work records.Egnsitional measuresjtft     The work of the Data Protection Committee should aim to ensure that the- 15 -RESTRICTED
ft&apos;liecessary interval before legislation can be introduced and come into force willl0i be one of doubt and uncertainty for the computer industry, computer users, andthe public   These interests will be consulted to the fullest extent possible whilethe legislation is being planned, bearing in mind that particular responsibilityfor implementing the safeguards proposed will fall upon the professional analysts,programmers and consultants.   The profession is still young, but they have already begun, through the British Computer Society, to devise appropriate codes, and full advantage should be taken of their expertise.Ik,     The Government will also, pending legislation, ensure that the administrativerules under v/hich its own computer systems are operated will continue to providesafeguards for the accuracy and relevance of personal information, and for theprivacy of the subjects of that information.   The Government trust that other computerusers, in both the public and private sectors, will follow this lead9- 16 -

co;:ruTK:-:s:SAFEGUARDS FOR PRIVACY.. &apos;.Tt;&quot;&quot;&quot;!&apos;TriiV1.The Government arc publishing thi.s Report as a supplement to theirWhite Paper on Computers and Privacy.&apos;1&apos;2,     The Committee on Privacy, chaired by Sir Kenneth Younger, reported thatthe total number of computers in use or on order in the United Kingdom for allare not strictly comparable, they indicate that the number has roughly doubledin only four years.     Not all of these computers are used to store personal information.     But undoubtedly, the use of computers to handle such information is increasing rapidly, in both the private and public sectors.3.    In parallel with the Younger Committee&apos;s examination of the private sector,an interdepartmental working party carried out a review of the categories ofinformation held, or likely to be held, in the computer systems of GovernmentDepartments, and the rules governing its storage and use.h.     The working party completed its investigation in 1972.     The present Reportsummarises its findings, brings them up to date, and gives comparable information about computers in those parts of the public sector which do not form part of central government and which the working party did not therefore study.     it also discusses the safeguards which operate to protect the privacy of personal information held in public sector computers.5.     The Report also gives some statistics of computer use in the United Kingdom,and outlines surveys which have been undertaken in the private sector since the younger Committee reported;   and it concludes with a discussion   f studiescarried out, and practices adopted or proposed, in other parts of the world.Computer Index shows that by April 1975 the number of computers actuallyoperational in the United Kingdom had risen to 13,263.

The state provides, or gives financial help towards, a number of services for its citizens - for example, health, social services and education.     To do this, it collects duties, taxes and contributions.These functions could not be carried out effectively without a good dealof information about the needs and circumstances of individuals.     such information is also required to provide the statistics needed for effectiveplanning and the efficient allocation of resources.Government computer tasks involving personal information8.    There are at present   Some  22.0   computer-based administrative &quot;tasks&quot;in central government, which use personal information about people otherthan the Governments own staff.     These are listed in summary form in Table 1.They include the records of the National Health Service which are centrallyheld.*       The table also includes statistical tasks where the names of the individuals to whom the data relate are held in the computer system itself,or where, although the names are .not held in the computer system, they are held in the same Department so that they could -be linked (eg via a sourcedocument or an index) with the data.       This chapter does not concern itselfvdth information held   aOcKii^       businesses or business statistics, but certain tasks are included in Table I because they contain entries forpartnerships and one-man businesses from which information about individualsmight be deduced. - ;* For details op other information on IMS computers see Chapter 3*
q.    the number of persons included in any task ranges from under 2,000people to a maximum (in the case of the census of population) of thewhole population of the country;    the; majority of tacks deal with between10,000 and one million persons each.10,     the personal information held for the purposes of these differentIttacks varies widely.     &apos; ftey includes-personal particulars (name, date of birth, marriage), address and changes of address, education backgroundand qualifications,   housing, possessions.(cars and other property),occupation (current job, previous jobs, dangerous jobs, retirement),health (general practice records, hospital treatment and dental care),and money (pay, pension, social security, tax and savings).     in total the list is formidable, but each task includes only a small part of all this information in its records.     moreover, the information is distributedamongst many different computers.     the government have no plans toconstruct a central data bank which would bring together in one computersystem all the personal information available in government departments -the administrative advantages to be gained from such a course are debatable,and. the practical difficulties and costs would be formidable - and theyhave no intention of allowing the computer systems under their control tobe linked together to produce such a result.consequences for privacy11.     the interdepartmental voicing party reported that the normal resultsof large-scale computerisation of records in government departments werethesei. the computer-aided system needed, fewer people to operateit than the manual system which it replaced and so the numberof potential observers of the data was less than before.ii. the computer took on so much of the clerical work (checking,
sorting, calculating, writing, and wo on) that the total time spent by human beings in examining the information in thesystem was very much reduced,,iii. People employed in computer systems usually had feweropportunities than their clerical counterparts to examine orcopy the data they were handling.     Computer operators seldomsaw in readable form more than a small fraction of the datapassing through the system.iv. Many operations were carried out without any humancontact with the total record.The working party therefore concluded that the introduction of computer systemswould in no way increase the threat to privacy by unauthorised disclosure of personal information held in the systems.12.     The working party also considered threats to privacy other thanunauthorised disclosure - in particular the danger of inaccuracy or unnecessaryretention of information and the possible dangers involved in the authorisedtransfer of information   within, between or beyond departments.Acairacy and retention of data13.    Inaccuracy in a personal record may result in dangers to privacy;   a conviction for dishonesty might, for instance, be attributed to the wrongJohn Smith;-  a taxpayer might be listed as a defaulter when his assessmentwas in fact still under appeal;    or a confidential notice might be sent tothe wrong address.     Information held in computers is no more prone to thiskind of error than information in manual records.     Government Departmentsmake every effort to ensure that information entering a computer isaccurate, especially by the use of credibility and consistency checks toREG! canada i tD.
detect certain errors which n human being might not notice.     moreover,accurate information is- far less likely to be transferred incorrectly bya computer than by a human being.     the quality of record keeping in a computer system is almost always higher than in a manual system.government departments are also anxious to avoid holding information for too long - not only might this violate privacy, but it also reducesprocessing efficiency.     the need to hold information is thereforeregularly reviewed, and frequent updating (which includes the discardingand destruction of unnecessary information as well as the insertion of newmaterial) is a normal routine.15.     table 2 lists all transfers of information about identifiableindividuals from the computer branches of departments to recipients otherthan the user branch (that part of the department which has managerialresponsibility for performing the task*), the individual himself or hisduly authorised agent (eg his accountant, solicitor or banker).     itdistinguishes human-readable output (eg printed page, microfilm, etc)from machine-readable output (eg magnetic tape or disc).16.    it will be seen that only a small proportion of the tasks in table 1are involved in such transfers, all of which take place for specific andveil-defined purposes.     in these few cases, information about identifiableindividuals is passed to third parties in accordance with the rules governingtransfers of information generally (ie the rules which apply whether or notthe information is held on computers).     this means that, without exception,transfers of information may take place only if the user branch is satisfiedthat the third party has a need to know the particular information, and canbe trusted to handle it responsibly,*   exceptions are local employment offices which pay unemploymentbenefit on behalf of dhsg, police forces using the policenational computer and post offices issuing broadcasting licences.
iy.     In all cases, the decision to transfer information to a third party is a tantter of carefully considered policy, for which the responsible minister is answerable to Parliament, and in many cases such disclosuresmay take place only under statutory authority.18.    These transfers of information take place for a number of reasons.They can reduce demands on the public to repeat information which theyhave already provided.     They can expedite the pi-ocess of Government:it is sometimes cheaper and quicker to obtain information from another department or another part of the same Department than directly from theperson concerned.     They may make it easier to identify the needs of an individual by connecting relevant details about him.     The Government fully recognise that the uncontrolled transfer of personal information, even within Government, is undesirable and that certain records, such as incometax returns, medical records, census returns and criminal records, merit ahigh degree of interdepartmental confidentiality - and this they receive.19.    Host of the tasks mentioned in paragraph        above are carried outon a computer within the Department which sponsors and controls the task.Some may be run in another Government Department.     On rare occasions work has to be given to external organisations, including commercial bureaux.In all these cases, the sponsoring Department ensures that the safeguards for privacy conform with the standards which the Department would itselfapply, and one means of ensuring this is to hand the records to the bureauin such a form that the individual to whom they refer cannot be identified.S^ecirrit^r20.    The Government use three main categories of physical and technicalsafeguards:-i.       Control, of physical s to the convDUter area (machines,tapes, discs, etc) and any terminals.     This includes the issue
of official passes or badges to staff, the escorting of visitors,the locking of entry points, and the recording of entries andexits.ii. technical safeguards which can be built into the system.the computer can be programmed   to allow access to        particularfiles only in response to an authorised password, and to reportsuccessful and unsuccessful attempts at access.     the dataproduced may also be &quot;scrambled&quot;, so that only authorisedpersonnel can interpret them.iii. organisational and procedural measures to guard againstmisuse of information.     for example, the principle of&quot;separation of duties&quot; may be applied:   that is, access to some data may be allowed only with the knowledge and consentof someone in a different part of the organisation.the safeguards vary with the nature of the system and the information whichit holds.     for any given system, a decision on the most appropriate measuresis the responsibility of the sponsoring department and, ultimately, of itsministers,     these measures are subject to regular review, both within thedepartment concerned and by other government authorities.21.     the arrangements for safeguarding information entrusted to thegovernment in confidence were tightened up in T971. following publicity aboutthe activities of certain private inquiry firms.     although allegations havebeen made from time to time about access by unauthorised persons to informationheld in government computers, these have not been substantiated.rp-glLvhfentiality22.     in addition to the safeguards set out above, information I  id inncomputers is subject to the same stringent departmental administrative rulesas information held in manual files.     in both cases the appropriate minister is responsible to parliament.
2j,    some administrative rules are derived from statute or subordinatewislation.     certain statutes (for example, the births and deathsregistration act 1953, the marriage act &quot;19Z*9 and the land charges act 1925)impose a requirement to disclose specified information in specified cases,subject to specified procedures.     there are also a number of statuteswhich prohibit the disclosure of information.     the taxes management act 1970,for example, requires inland revenue officials to make declarations that information received in the execution of their duties will not be disclosedexcept for the purposes of those duties, for a prosecution for an inlandrevenue offence, or in other cases required by law.     particulars ofbusiness dealingsobtained for statistical purposes under the statistics oftrade act 19V? fay not be used for assessing tax:    they are not availableeven to the administrative side of the department which has collected them.information about identifiable individuals collected in the census ofpopulatiorr under the provisions of the census act 1920, is not divulged bythe census offices to third parties.     other examples are the wireless telegraphy acts, and the rehabilitation of offenders act 197*f.2h,    not all statistical censuses and surveys are carried out on a statutory basis.     many are voluntary, but even for these * strictconfidentiality procedures apply.       as an indication of their concern,the government are now working on a set of guidelines covering the procedures for processing and safeguarding statistical data.25.    there is also some general legislation which restricts the use by government of the information which it holds.     under section 2 of theofficial secrets act 1911 it is an offence for any person who has information which he has obtained or to which he has access, in the course of his officialduties, to communicate it to anyone other than someone to whom it is his official duty to communicate it.     it is also an offence for a civil servant
to retain such information longer than his official duties require or to fail to ttake all reasonable care of it, or so to conduct himself as to endanger its safety;and it is an offence for anyone to receive information which is passed to him in contravention of the act.*accountability to parliament26.     ministers are accountable to parliament for the administrative rules which protect the confidentiality of personal information within their departments.    -this means that ministers can be questioned in parliamentnot only about the rules themselves but also about individual bx&quot;eaches,or alleged breaches, of confidentiality.       it also means that specificcomplaints can be investigated by the parliamentary commissioner for administration (the &quot;ombudsman&quot;).     at the request of a member of parliament,the commissioner can investigate complaints about &quot;any action taken by or onbehalf of a government department, being action taken in the exercise of administrative functions&quot;, and the government accept that the abuse or misuseof information held in government computers comes under this definition.the commissioner has confirmed that he would consider it appropriate for himto investigate complaints submitted to him about any alleged misuse ofgovernment computers.     machinery therefore already exists for the investi-gation of such complaints.     moreover, the commissioner can investigate notonly the particular action complained of, but also the departmental rule(if there was one) which led to the action.     it is the present commissioner1spractice, where he considers that such a course would be appropriate, to askdepartments to review administrative rules and to let him know the results ofthat review.*   a departmental committee on section 2 of the official secrets act 19&apos;11, under the chairmanship of lord franks, recommended in its report (c;nnd 510&apos;t) the repeal of that section and itsreplacement by an official information act.     the committee considered that it should be an offence under the new act for a -&apos;civil servant to disclose, contrary to his duty, information givento the government by private individuals or concerns.   the government.are considering the recommendation of the franks committee and intend to announce their conclusions ,as:aeon as possible.
Concjiisi^as27.In summary,then, the Government hold a good deal of information about individual citizens, which they require to meet the individualsneed.&apos;.; and those of the community as a whole *     An increasing amount ofthis information is held in computers, because the Government must make use of the most advanced techniques if these can help to carry outnecessary functions more efficiently and economically.   But the government also   have a duty to each individual to ensure that the information whichhe or she\imparted to them in confidence is not disclosed to anyone whodoes not need to know it, and that it is not used for the wrong purposes.This chapter has described the measures already in force to protect theprivacy of the personal information held by the Government about individualcitizens.     But the Government recognise that the increasing computerisationof its records has given rise to concern in some areas, and they are determined that the highest standards of confidentiality should bemaintained in the future.       They have therefore decided that their proposals for safeguarding the privacy of personal information held incomputers should apply not only to systems in the private sector and inother parts of the public sector, but to systems in Government Departmentsalso.     The details of those proposals are set out in the White Paper.

C08WJTKN3 IN TIB NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE08,    National Health Service- records contain personal information aboutnearly everyone in the country.     The authorities and individuals usingthese records (whether maintained on computers or^as most still are,manually) have the responsibility for safeguarding the information whichthey contain.29,     Lists of general practioncrs&apos; patients are held by Family PractitionerCo;imiittees* established by Area Health Authorities;    each general practitionerholds his own patients&apos; records;    and each Health Authority holds recordsabout the health service which it administers.     Information from thesewidely scattered records is collected for management or research purposescither regionally or centrally;   and both manual and computer systems are used for this purpose.30.    There are We large central records:   the National Health Service CentralRegister for England and Wales and X similar Registers for Scotland,/!    Bcfe-h A &amp;are manual systems.     They contain a limited amount of non-medical information about everyone who has registered with a National Health Service general practitioner and about all the newly-born.     The We- registers help to control the issue of new NHS numbers and, by disseminating information about patientswho have died, left the country or joined the Armed Forces, they assist family practitioner Committees to maintain the accuracy of doctors lists.     Theselists are important in defining a doctor&apos;s obligations to the Service, andthey provide the basis for a substantial part of his remuneration.       EachRegister also acts as a clearing house for the transmission of informationbetween Family Practitioner Committees when patients change their doctor.Consideration is now being given to putting&apos; Family Practitioner Committees&apos;own records on computers, which could then handle some of the Committees&apos;administrative tasks.     A pilot scheme has proved successful and a secondtrial is planned.     Further success could point the way to a general-n Scotlarid/\thcrc are no Family Practitioner Committees; aa4 the lists are held-Aby the Health Boardsi^**V *t*t /^-yvvtew?. $re ctv%-c/ -t*u Jtke. t&amp;es&amp;mS.J..........  ; -   r . &apos; ...K :: .:., i      &apos;;    &apos;
neuter system for Family Practitioner Committee records.comyi,    Host Regional &quot;callli Authorities have their own computers which performvarious management tasks and a range of applications peculiar to health care.Computing facilities in Wales are provided by the Welsh Health TechnicalServices Organisation.     In Scotland computing facilities are provided byHealth Board consortia computers and by the Scottish Office Computer Service.One of the most important of these applications in England and Wales isHospital Activity Analysis (HAA) in which computers are used to analyse the data about periods which people spend as hospital in-patients, in order toprovide doctors and administrators with clinical, management and planninginformation.     A number of NHS hospitals have computers and a list of typicalcomputing tasks using personal information from which individuals can be identified tS given in Table J.32.    Department of Health and Social Security computers are used to process -the Mental Health Enquiry (MRS), which records data for psychiatric patientssimilar to that covered by HAA for other patients, 7ke.MH  recces lAcAorAe,.-Hi^ftta. pectvtirttS.    The identifiable data are used in a limited way to assistbona fide medical research workers in special projects.     DHSS computers arealso used for the provision of other health service statistics and for NHSsuperannuation work.       In Scotland, the Scottish Health Service CommonIServices Agency undertakes similar statistical processing work, so far using the facilities of the &quot;Scottish Office Computer Service and Area Health Board.33*    Computers are used by the Dental Estimates Board to handle NHS records and produce statistics;   by universities, mainly for research purposes;   andby the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys where a variety of morbiditydata, some including the names of patients, is processed to produce statisticsand to assist epidemiological studies.The complex field of computing within the National Health Service was
reviewed in 1971 &quot;by representatives of the NII3, DilSS and a firm ofnojjB^ftfsenk consultants.*     This resulted in fresh guidance being rivenabout safeguards for computer records including security measures, and about the need to restrict the use of medical records held on computersto the same purposes as the manual records which they replace.yj.    The policy about the confidentiality of personal information storedin computers is the same as that which has always applied to other ways ofstoring it.     The practices of the authorities responsible for the health services accord, by tradition and discipline, with the spirit of the younger Committee \s principles.-:-     These practices are influenced and assisted by the close involvement of several professions which have long been sensitive to the need to protect the privacy of their clients.     Themedical profession in particular has a well-known and old-establishedtradition of maintaining the confidentiality of information, and thestatement by the Medical Research Council &quot;Responsibility in the use of medical information for research&quot; guides the profession about the uses of personal data for research.* ^&apos;he report of the review &quot;Using Computers to Improve Health services a Review for the National Health Service&quot;, is available from DESS (CR3),6-16 St Andrew Street, London HCh 3AD.* See Table 1 in the White Paper Cmnd.

. POLICE COMPUTERSComputers are used for a variety of police administrative purposes suchas pay, personnel records, crime and accident statistics and in a feu instancesthe records of firearms and shotgun certificates.   Computer services fox&apos; these purposes arc provided for the Metropolitan Police by a joint organisation which also serves the Home Office (where the safeguards described in Chapter 2for central government computers apply);   and for other forces by their localauthorities (where the safeguards described in Chapter 5 for local governmentcomputers opply).   Police operational purposes, especially in relation tocriminal records and the detection of crime, are in part served by the Police.National Computer and to a small but increasing extent by sma]ler computersused by individual forces.   The use of computers for these purposes ie described in paragraphs 42-^6 below.Police R coords27^     The Centra]. Criminal Record Office, which is the responsibility of theCommissioner of Police of the Metropolis, maintains a national record ofpersons convicted of serious offences and of wanted and missing persons,stolen vehicles and other property.   Its records are compiled from information about convictions which all police forces and penal institutions send to new Scotland Yard.   These records arc available to all forces in the UnitedKingdom, and are essential to the prevention and detection of crime.   Extractsore given to the courts when they need to know theprevious criminal record of persons convicted of criminal offences.33.     Nine regional criminal record offices in England and \k &apos; eov and separateoffices in Scotland and Northern Ireland, hold records about local crimesand criminals and supplement the service given to forces by the Central CriminalRecord Office.   Records are also held at individual force headquarters.   The
security and confidentiality of regional and force records is the responsibilitof the appropriate chief officer of police.y).    Chief officers of police have a3ways taken great care to prevent unnutbert;ed disclosure to persons outside the police service of information from recordoffices.   Information about previous convictions must be provided for thecourt;; and the prison service but otherwise the principle is that no recordinformation is given to anyone, however responsible, unless considerations of public interest justify it.   Since 1 July 1975? the reporting of many oldconvictions has been- further restricted by the Rehabilitation of OffendersAct 1975.tO.    The principles and procedures governing the supply of police informationhave been carefully reviewed since the Younger Committee reported, and were described in a statement in Parliament by the then Home Secretary on 1^ June19?;;.   Briefly, reports about current convictions are made by the police tothe relevant public or professional body about:(a) doctors, dentists, nurses, persons employed in the care of children,and youth leaders, because they stand in a position of trust tovulnerable members of society,(b) civil servants, atomic energy and Post Office permanent staff,in the interests of national security, and(c) magistrates, justices of the peace, barristers, solicitors, andsolicitors&apos; managing clerks, because they have a direct responsibiiifor the administration of the law.Anyone about whom a current conviction is reported to a professional or publicbody is told, that tine report has been made,h-1.    Where the police are authorised by statute to provide evidence aboutthe suitability of applicants for certain licences, they must discharge their duty to assist the courts or other statutory body.   The applicants&apos;in thesecases are told what evidence is given by the police.   The police also maintainthe practice,/which does not have specific statutory authority, of helping.       .Social Services Departments in considering applications from adoptive and
foster parents.   The background of applicants to join police forces is alsochecked and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and the Gaming Boardarc assisted by reports fro::; the polios.    In ill these cases the applicantsarc told that checks are being wade.5he Police National Computer;,.2.     The Police National Computer, which began to operate in 197&apos;t* is theresponsibility of the Home Office in consultation with the police service,who share the cost.   Its purpose is to automate the storage and retrievalof certain of the recoxxis held by the central and regional criminal recordoffices and by police forces:   these comprise indices to records of persons convicted of serious offences, wanted and missing persons, stolen vehicles,disqualified drivers and persons with suspended sentences.   Information aboutkeepers of motor vehicles, kept by the Department of the Environment at Swanseawill also be available,4.3.     The principles and procedures governing the disclosure of police recordinformation outlined in paragraph 39above are not affected by the PoliceNational Computer.   The computer replaces manual methods and speeds up access to the records in order to give forces better operational support, but theChief Constable of the force which
receives the information remains responsible for ensuring that itis not passed outside the police service except in accordance withthe arrangements described in paragraph 399 There are extensivesafeguards for the security of the information stored on the computer:all computer terminals are in supervised premises. protected fromunauthorised access and connected to the computer centre by privatelines;s*- information cannot be put into or obtained from the computerunless the police operator identifies his terminal and proves his authority.Other Police Operational ComputersUK. The smaller operations! computers used by forces are designedprimarily to speed up police response to calls for assistancej theyare also to be used for other tasks previously done manually,   Afew forces obtain help from their local authority computer for someof these purposes.Kb&apos;  A computer system is being planned to handle information heldby the Metropolitan Police about crime, criminals and their associates.The system will be internal to those branches of the force who nowuso this information in manually held records, and it will not beconnected to any other system.   In the Thames Vally Police a forcecomputer is being used experimentally to process and analyse the records of all the force1s collators (who assemble and collateinformation required for the prevention and detection of crime).The object of the experiment is to see whether the use of a computerfor these purposes could be of significant operational benefit ina typical police force.46. The security and confidentiality of information relating tocrime and criminals held on a local computer is the responsibilityof the chief constable concerned.   Special attention is given tosafeguards against unauthpriscd access.
LOCAl&apos; GOVERNMENT COMPUTERSft,  Since the last war an increasingly largo proportion of total public   expenditure-bocn devoted to local government.   This   reflects the widened range cf servicesundertaken by local authorities.    Even though certain functions in connection with.-2o, electricity, water (in England and Wales) and Health Services have beentransferred to ether authorities, these losses have been counterbalanced by theI grovftb of now services and the expansion of others, notably those connected witheducation, housing and services for children, the elderly and the handicapped.48. Snphasis is increasingly being placed on the interdependence of services, whichare no longer regarded (as they tended to be in the past) as self-contained.and separate functions,but rather as activities which are complementary to each other and which can be provided effectively only on this basis.   The Royal Commission ct\Local Government in England, 1966-69, identified two main and related groups of services: the &quot;environmental&quot; and the &quot;personal&quot; groups; and it was one of the aims of local government reorganisation to ensure that, so far as is practicable,responsibility for each group is placed in the hands of the same authorities sothat the full benefits of the integrated planning, organisation and management of these services can be obtained.49.   A significant effect of reorganisation, which took place in 1974 in Englandand Wales, and this year in Scotland, has been to reduce in ail three countries the total   number of authorities, with a consequent increase in the average size of each local authority, in terms of both, population and resources.5-1 In short, the increase in both the range and complexity of local government,services has been accommodated by the creation of authorities which are not onlyresponsible for related groups of services, but also better able to benefit fromthe use of computers as part of more sophisticated management techniques.   Theincrease in the use of computers in local government since the mi--1960s is, there-fore, certain to continue.
rji.  The local Authoxitiea-&quot;Management Services and Computer Committee, which wasup by local /government in 19v/ to provide a national advisory service for local authorities on management matters, maintains a register of local authoritycomputers and the uses to which they are put.   That information is publishedperiodically.   In April 1975 &quot;the Department of the Environment published thereport of the General Review of Local Authority Management Information Systems,which had been prepared for the Secretary of State for the Environment byKcKinsey and Company Incorporated.   The report surveyed current work and thinkingon the development and use of computers by local authorities, and put forwardrecommendations as to how the very great potential benefits of computers couldniost effectively be exploited in local government in future.52.   Broadly, the main purposes for which computers were first used in localgovernment were those involving the large-scale handling of financial data, suchas rates and housing rents.   Since then, they have been used by a number of localauthorities for the storage and processing of data already kept by them in otherforas; for instance, personnel records on local authority employees, electoralregisters, and educational and social services records.   The use of computers in local government for this sort of record-keeping and processing will continue todevelop.   In addition, computers are likely to be increasingly used as generalaids to management in financial calculations, in the appraisal of alternative courses of action, and in the operation and planning of related services which involve data based on population, land, property, employment and traffic flows.As the McKinsey report emphasised, the use of computers for appropriate tasksbrings significant advantages in terms of speed and efficiency, and can play a valuable role in enabling local authorities to make the optimum use of theresources available to them in meeting the needs of the communities they serve.Ncedjor Safeguards53.   Local authorities necessarily hold information about individuals, althoughmuch of it is anonymous or not confidential.   Information which a local authority
collects for one service can &quot;be useful for another.   Tor example, statisticsderived from birth records held in health departments have been used to forecastschool populations.   The scops for using for one purpose information whichhas been collected for another is likely to increase as local authorities move towards corporate management and set up general information systems.   In thesecircumstances it is clear that the need for confidentiality of personal information is, and must continue to be, an important consideration in the development ofcomputerised information systems.   This point has already been emphasised inadvice to local - authorities by the Department of the Environment.&amp;: i sti n (?,Saf e uard s%i   Local authorities have for long been used to holding personal information,.. .... ..and protecting its confidentiality.   In particular, officers are charged intheir rules and conditions of service not to communicate the contents of-any document   to the public ^\majesty&apos;s required by law or explicitly authorised to do so.?e chosei. Tr-**t &apos;v     eLocal authorities are chosei. 9*** electorates and are accountable&apos;to themfor &quot;standards.&apos;.of administrajv ^jjBfsr^their area.   To help the members of localauthorities to maintain&apos;such standards, the Local Government Acts 1974 (Englandand Wales) and 1975 (Scotland) provide for the appointment of local Commissionersfor Administration, vdio have a role similar in local government to that of theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration in central government.   They havethe power to investigate complaints about alleged maladministration by localauthorities, including branches of privacy in the handling of personal information,and they are able to- report on their investigations.55- The McKinsey report found that loeal authorities in general were very aware of their responsibility for protecting sensitive data, and that arrangements for i;;preserving confidentiality and security had resulted in relative&apos; j few complaints&apos;.of breaches.   Nevertheless, policies and practices varied between localauthorities,, and the arrangements in some authorities would be regarded .by others as abusing confidentiality or&apos; secuUt&apos;y.There was as yet little consensus
on the extent to which the development of computerised management informationtfa..v should be limited to preserve confidentiality.   The report concluded that&apos;unless agreement was reached on the guidelines needed to control developments,5oae authorities were likely to miss opportunities for realising significantbenefits, while others would run the risk of releasing information improperly.!p.  Some steps have been taken towards the achievement of a common approach to standards and&quot;safeguards through the advisory service given by the LocalAuthorities Management Services and Computer Committee which, among otherpublications, has issued &quot;Computer Privacy: Notes of Guidance      Local. Authorities.&quot;This covers, among other things, the collection, organisation and storage ofdata, the restriction of access to computers and terminals to guard against un-authoxised use, and the safeguarding of printed output from computers.   Localauthorities generally have found this advice useful.57. The processing and storage of information in local government computersare,therefore, already subject to a variety of safeguards and, as McKinsey andCospany found, local authorities generally are well aware of their responsibilities in this field.   But, as with computers used by central government and by other organisations, there can be no room for complacency.   The proposals contained inthe Unite Paper v/ill reinforce the protection already available, and will help&apos;to ensure that the consistently increasing use of computers by local authorities,itself desirable in terms of efficient administration, will not result in any increased danger to privacy.Conclusion
jiiOii!iIISED IHDUSTEY COMPUTERSThe nationalised industries hold   oilllng details for some 90i;o-i accounts in their computers.   These may include licenceItsils (as, for example, in the Post Office or British Waterways) astil as the details usually required for securing payment forervices rendered and for credit control,ft/ Individual industries also hold their own specialised, types of personal records.   For example, the gas industry holds personallecords ah out the work of converting appliances to natural gas, thePost Office holds G^I^E^O^ re cords ^and British Airways holds airlinelooking details.    In addition, those industries which own housesl(e.g. the National Coal Board) either have or are developing com-puterised rent systems.    It is normal for all nationalised industries to hold purchase and sales ledger information on computers.1 *60. According to the Nationalised Industries Computer Committee jtone of the main effects of putting personal records on computers haspen to allow authorisation procedures to he made stricter and easierlo control, thus rendering access more difficult.   In addition, the[computer systems are designed to include built-in security codes andIto provide for the maximum of anonymity at each stage.   They alsospecify the periods beyond which information may not be retained.61. Certain nationalised industries and. other public authoritiesare subject to statutory restrictions on the disclosure of      &apos;\Corvmittoo, which represents all the nationalised industries,Provides a forum for discussion and advises on the use of computersW this part of the public sector.   .It superseded in 1970 the&quot;Rationalised Industries Electronic Data Processing Committee whichtod been established in 1959.
location to third parties.   In some cases - for example the Post Office Corporation,it0Bic Energy Authority and the Civil Aviation Authority - the Officials Secrets Actsjnue to apply as they did before these bodies ceased to be Government Departments.   Inlease of the Post Office Corporation there is also a specific provision in section 65Ihe Post Office Act 1969 which imposes obligations of secrecy on all employees in itsProcessing Service,   It provides specific penalties for infringements, which are madein to the employees.   Other industries are subject to restrictions imposed by theslation which created them.I Disclosure of information to the individual concerned is, of course, a regularthough only an incidental) feature of the operation of industries like gas, coal andptricity.   In the course of a year a good deal of the information which these industriespbout a customer is copied to him in some form or other.   The customer therefore an opportunity to check its accuracy.TSR USE AND PROCEDURES IN UK1 Published figures give some idea of the scale of computer use, but these givettle direct evidence of implications for the privacy of personal information.   Manythe computers used in the UK are small and either do not have the facilities or areled in such a way that the creation and maintenance of large personal files is unlikely,ptheless,   there are several thousands of computer systems used for purposes whichKit impinge directly on privacy.   There is no single source of complete statisticsall computers used in the UK.   The National Computer Index contains detailed recordsfl3,263 computers operational in the UK in April 1975.   Table 4 analyses this figure,I classifies the industries using computers into very broad categories, and theInclusions which can be drawn from it are therefore limited.   But the table does showpat in the -private sector, (outside the manufacturing and construction industries in which

The Younger Committee was not able to attempt any factualpalysis of computer use in the private sector; nor could it providepy assessment of the efficiency of the safeguards already inpstonco to protect the privacy of personal information.    Since the forward Industrial ClassificationilSiiiillft, v .
Younger report was published, however, there have been two separate studies of computer use, both of which have provided some useful information. The first was a survey conducted by the British Computer Society of some 44 large organisations using computers; the second was a wider study of security in computer systems carried out under the auspices of the National Computing Centre Limited.

65. The Privacy and Public Welfare Committee of the British Computer Society was looking at the problem of privacy and the computer while the Younger Committee was sitting and, like the Younger Committee, found itself short of "hard" information about computer use in the private sector. To correct that situation, the B.C.S. Committee sent questionnaire to 56 large organisations between August 1972 January 1973. An analysis of the 44 organisations which replied has been published by the Society.* Not surprisingly, the survey showed at the amount of personal information held about people is increasing and that computers have made it easier to hold such information. But it also showed that much of the information thought by respondents to be sensitive was still held manually and there was little evidence of the exchange or transfer of such information between organisations. The report also notes that "very few organisations seem at the moment to be correlating information." Organisations varied a good deal in the amount of attention which they devoted to privacy (as distinct from security) questions, and the Committee thought that there was a need for greater awareness in this area. But the Report concluded that the results of the survey indicated that organisations generally were aware of the potential problems of security and that it was probable that they were taking good deal more care with computer-held information than they had done previously with manual filing systems.

ftlQ K.C.C. Survey of computer use was addressed to those whoase ot: computers in all pert:; of the private and publicIt was designed to consider all aspects of the security  computer systems from the point of view of financial control,i^srcial confidentiality and statutory requirements, as well asprivacy of personal information.   Questionnaires were sent toruinations known or thought to he using computers and, in eachse the questionnaire was addressed to a &quot;user   of computerraces within the organisation, as well as to the head of thecoprocessing unit.   Over 150 organisations agreed to take part the survey.   Some of the questionnaires were followed up bynterviews, designed to elicit attitudes to security and privacy,15 eell as to provide factual information about the safeguardsheady in force.   The results of the survey * agree with the B.O.S.incline that those organisations which hold information which theylegarcl as confidential go to a good deal of trouble to look after it. Indeed, this is often as much in their own interests as itis in the interests of those to whom the information relates.&apos;68. As a result of recommendations put forward in thcX report,i.C.C. has initiated a series of projects designed to increasemowledge and understanding of security, and has established apntral reference body to provide computer users and manufacturerslath information and guidance about security measures.   This centralreference body is advised by a committee whose members represent,between them, all sections of the computer industry -   The Governmentplooae this initiative, and are glad to note the&apos;efforts being &apos;sade by the F.C.C, and members of the industry themselves, to makecomputer systems increasingly secure, and therefore less vulnerable to threats which could endanger  pcC^ccct)SggjJText for Computer --Security: ^NnWo.nal JStudy Group ReportHeC&apos;c Publications November lcj?4.

I p.    The throat to privacy from computers handling personal informal! cnvh2s been recognised in many other countries.   The solutions devised vary, Tor.; .-; must inevitably take account of local factor.; such as the ecu? titutionalTid institutional structures of the country concerned, its history, its culture n(] its traditional public attitudes.    But motHMtV.,4Wv,&quot; isc*..^r*d&amp;ioXi(0 lo learned from all the work which has been done abroad; and the most important0f the foreign studies, legislative proposals, and statutes in force aresiwiaarised below.Uhite.^States^of America70.   In the United States, public anxiety about computers ana privacy has beenarticulate and widespread for a number of years.   It was investigated, inconnection with a. proposal for a National Data Centre, by a sub-committee ofthe House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations as long agoas 1966/67, and by a sub-committee on Administrative Practice and procedure of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in the following year.   It has been investigated by many others since then.71,   Of these investigations, two in particular deserve mention here.   unlike the Younger Committee&apos;s enquiry, they were carried out by committees havingRESTRICTED
expert Knowledge of computers; but like the Younger Committee, their investigations also resulted in proposals for action which included one or meresets of &quot;principles&quot; for the operation of computers to safeguard the accuracyand privacy of personal information stored in them.72.  The first of these was a Report ^to the Committee on Scientific andTechnical Information (&quot;CGSflTT?) of the U.S. Government&apos;s Federal Council of science and Technology, prepared by its Panel on Legal Aspects of InformationSystems.   A summary of the &quot;principles&quot; to be extracted from this report is to bo found in Table       6(2173.   The second was the Report N    , published in July 1973, of the AdvisoryCommittee en Automated Personal Data Systems appointed by the IKS.. Secretaryof Health; Education and Welfare (&quot;The HEW Report&quot;).   This Report recommended the enactment of a Federal &quot;Code of Fair Information Practice&quot; for all automatedpersonal data systems.   The Code rests on five basic principles which would begiven legal effect as &quot;safeguard requirements&quot; for such systems.   These&quot;principles&quot; are set out in Table      1 .   *74. Following these recommendations, a number of Bills were introduced in theCongress. After much debate, one of them - the Privacy Act 1974 - was passedand became law on 1st January 1975* It operates by placing upon all Federalagencies stringent requirements to- identify their record-keeping systems each year, and publish&apos;descriptive information about theoij- limit their record keeping to that which is lawful, relevantand necessary;(l) Published in The Honeywell Computer JournalVol. 7 (1973)j No.l.(2) DHEW Publication No (OS) 73 - 97
- inform individuals who are asfeed to provide informaticon by wh&amp;tauthority they arc asked the purpose for which the information is being collected, the use to which it will he put, and the legalimplications of not providing it;- permit individuals to examine records relating to them, and to correct or amend them;- ensure such accuracy, relevance, timeliness and completenessof records as is necessary to ensure fairness to the individual,and make reasonable efforts to meet those standards before anyrecord is disclosed;- restrict to a few specified cases the disclosure of recordswithout the consent of the individual concerned.Failure to perform these obligations will entitle the individual affected tosue the agency in. the Courts, and there are criminal sanctions against officials who&apos;knowingly and wilfully violate the provisions of the Act.   In addition, theAct sets up a Privacy Protection Study Commission to consider what further legislation may be required.Council of Europe75.  The United Kingdom is a founder member of the Council of Europe.   TheCommittee of Ministers of that organisation has recently adopted two resolutions which recommend to the Governments of all its member states that, for theprotection of the privacy of personal information in computers, they should giveeffect to the &quot;principles&quot; set out in the Resolutions,Resolution (73) 22, adopted on 26 September 1973ssets outprinciples to be implemented for computers in theprivatesecctor.   These arc reproduced in Table8Resolution (74) 2% adopted on 29 September 1974,sets outprinciples to be implemented for computers in thepublic sector.These are reproduced in Table9
0ct Coun trie3ji\  In ffffstJ&amp;mfjjinjri the Land Hesse passed a Data Protection Lav? in 1970, which,jnposos direct obligations on all data banks in the public sector, subject tocriminal sanctions, and places their enforcement under the supervision of asingle and independent Data Protection Officer.   A similar Data Protection Lav:,with civil as well as criminal sanctions, has also been in force in the landRbineland Palatinate for over a year.   In other Lander, notably Lower Saxony,administrative regulations controlling public sector data banks have been made.In 1973j the Federal Government presented a comprehensive Data Protection Bill,covering both the public and the private sector, to the Federal Parliament, whereit is currently being debated.   The Bill provides criminal sanctions for breach of its provisions.V&apos;  In a Data Act was passed in 1973*   Under this, no data banks holdingpersonal information may be maintained in the public or the private sector except with the permission, and under the supervision of, a Data Inspection Board whichhas wide powers to control their operations by making regulations.   There arecivil and criminal sanctions for breach.   The only exceptions to this rule aredata banks established according to a decision by the King or Parliament, but theviews of the Data Inspection Board must&apos;be sought before any such decision istaken; and the Board is required to issue regulations for the operation of suchdata banks if the King or Parliament has not made any:]8.  In Austria, the Government have recently presented a draft Data Protectionlaw to Parliament which, like the Federal German one, would impose directobligations on all data banks in the public and private sectors.   These obligationswould be supervised and enforced by an independent Data Protection Commission,and there are criminal sanctions.79.   In New Zealand, a sub-committee of the Law Revision Commission published a report in April 1973 on Computer Data Banks and Privacy.   This recommendedlegislation to set up an independent agency to investigate, appraise and inspect
-liter data banks in both the public and private sectors and to make recommendations,,, iiew Zealand Government have promised legislation this year,,In Denmark, a Committee set up by the Government has completed its study of the.jvate sector and recommended legislation in the form of a draft Bill which wouldtup a registration board and impose wide obligations on all data banks in theivate sector, enforced by criminal sanctions.   The Committee is now investigatinge public sector.In Norway, two Bills, dealing respectively with the public and private sectors,^been presented by Royal Commissions.   They would impose direct obligationsall data banks, whether or not they are computerised, and establish a Datairveillance Service.   For the private sector, there would be both civil and criminalnotions,1 h1 ill? Netherlands, a Committee of experts set up by the Government publishedInterim Report in 197^, recommending that, as a first step, there should betitulary registration of all data banks, and a legal right for all individuals tonspect and correct their records.   The Committee also recommended the introductionfa licensing system after furthei&apos; study of the necessary details.   Meanwhile,March of this year, the Government issued stringent directives for the operationif its own computer systems,.f&apos; *n Cfflada, a Task Force established jointly by the Federal Departments ofaaunications and Justice reported in 1972 and discussed various possible statutoryeasures.   Draft legislation is being considered by the Canadian Parliament,&apos; *n France, a Commission on Data Processing and Freedom, appointed by the President&apos; the Republic in November 197&apos;i-, has recently published its Report.   It recommendshe creation of a new independent agency to function as a kind of social consciencein relation to data processing, with certain powers of control.   It also recommendsertain constraints, in both the public and the private sector, on the collectionnd storage of personal data, and the creation of a right for individuals and .pociations to know and to criticise the data stored about them.?&apos; Reparations for legislation are also being made in Belgium, Finland, the Irish^public and Spain,

THE PRIKC.IPLIS RECOMMENDED IN THE COCATI RSPOOTIn-gathering information from individual citizens, agencies have an obligationto disclose to them, the purpose for which, the information is being collected,to state clearly the- use or uses to which it vrill be put, to identify the individuals and organisations that will be given access to it, and to indicatewhether the individual&apos;s name will be associated, either directly or indirectly,uith the information.Unless disclosure is required by law, personal information must never be extracted from an individual without securing his informed, express consent.fihen personal information of any degree of sensitivity is collected from sourcesothe-r than the data subject himself, the data collector is always under an obligation,to verify its accuracy.   If this is impossible, it is necessary to indicate the source of information, the fact that it has not been verified, and why it couldnot bo verified.Every agency has an obligation not to engage in repetitious information-gatheringexercises.When data are transferred by one agency to, or exchanged with, another, the natureof tho data-originating agency&apos;s&apos; understanding with the individual must be broughtto tho remote user&apos;s attention and he must be obligated to honour it.Particular attention must be paid to information stored in a remote-access system,:to protect individualised information from improper access through the network.In addition, the security of personal information transmitted from point to point :nust be guaranteed.   Even in systems that do not have remote access features,procedures must be established for ensuring the physical security of data filesagainst improper intrusion, or destruction.8ben thc legitimate needs of the information-gathering agency require data to be  ,put to uses or to be disclosed to people beyond the scope of the understanding
Altered onto with the subject; at the time the information was originated, a newpjicrstandirsft should bo entered into with the individual unless circumstancesC3Ke tiiii&apos;- impossibleoindividual data subject should be granted access to the information recordedabout him and procedures should bo established that enable him to ensure the accuracy of the information and to determine whether his files have been abused.This will necessitate establishing and giving him access to monitoring logsthat show who has sought access to his files -and for what purpose.Each agency should engage in a periodical review of its files to ascertain whenpersonal information should be expunged, placed in a form of storage that isloss accessible, or archived.   Archival data should never bo released to thepublic until a sufficient period has elapsed so that there is no longer any possibility of injury to any individual.   When an agency determines that personal information is no longer of utility, and should be destroyed in the interest ofprivacy and file confidentiality, that decision should bo communicated to anyother agency and any private individual or organisation that has received a copyof the data, and a requirement made that said copy, or any other copies that mayhave been made, be likewise destroyed.   This will require that an agreement forsuch disposition at the request of the issuing agency be obtained before suchpersonal information is made available.Individual citizens should be given the right to request the expungementof personal information that is maintained in an agency file when there is noexpress statute or regulation requiring its preservation.The responsibility of implementing these principles should be given to personnelwho are not associated with the day-to-day operation of the system and theyshould be expressly charged with the responsibility to make certain that theyarc honoured.
