THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(72) 5619 May 1972CABINETPRESCRIPTION charges memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Serviceoand the Secretary of State for wales. The Government announced in 1970 (Cmnd 4515) thatprescription charges should be related more closely to a proportion ofthe cost of the individual prescription.    At their meeting on  November last (CM(71) 53rd Conclusions, Minute 5) the cabinet decided to drop the system of graduated charges; but the announcement would not exclude the possibility of changing the system by which thelevel of the flat-rate charge was settled.    No further action would betaken on the flat-rate charge until the Cabinet considered the situationagain in the spring of 1972.2. The two questions to be considered are:-a. whether we should increase the prescription chargein the near future under existing powers and, if so, by how much and when;b. whether we should introduce new legislation which wouldinter alia enable ua to establish a fixed relationship betweenthe flat-rate prescription charge and the average cost of aprescription and to make any consequential alterations in thecharge annually by administrative action.    By this means thepolicy announced in Cmnd 4515 would be put into effect atleast partially.3.        As to a. we could increase the charge by regulations subject tothe negative resolution procedure.    The present charge of 20p per itemwas introduced on 1 April 1971;  so if it were concluded that the charge should be increased but that, in order to keep in line with the confederation of British Industry&apos;s initiative, we should not go beyond anincrease of 5 per cent each year, we could increase it to 22p with effect from, say, 1 October 1972.    This would yield about  Z\ million(Great Britain) in a full year.COPY NO63i
4.        As to (b), the new legislation would enable us to secure buoyancyin the yield of prescription charges (eg if drug costs increased by some9 per cent a year, as they did between 1971 and 1972, the new arrange-ments would automatically yield an extra S.Zj million).    Moreover,the relatively small annual adjustments which would be necessary would cause less political and presentational difficulty than larger increasesmade at longer intervals and based on no clear rationale.   It wouldalso give us new powers in relation to other National Health Service(NHS) charges, on lines previously approved by the Social services committee.    The powers would enable us :-i.      to vary both the amounts of charges due to be paid bypatients and the methods of assessing these amounts ascurrently laid down in Statutes; and ii.      to vary the categories of people at present entitledto be exempted from charges or to receive refunds and the description of appliances which do not attract charges.These powers could be used to reduce the age of exemption from dentaltreatment charges from 21 to 18, and thus give effect to the decisionannounced in 1970 in the White Paper &quot;New Policies for Public Spending&quot;(Cmnd 4515).    They would also enable us to make some desirableadjustments in optical charges, including the imposition of a charge forspectacle cases.5.        If we decide not at present to alter the prescription charge weshould nevertheless consider whether or not to proceed with thelegislation.    The main argument against is that it would be bothunpopular and politically controversial.    The arguments for going aheadare that the new powers are all likely to be needed at some time or other,that it would be useful to establish the principle of a fixed relationship between the prescription charge and the average cost of a chargeableprescription and that we shall be enabled to take action on the specificmatter of the age of exemption from dental treatment charges.    Loweringthe age of exemption to 18 would produce savings of between  2 million and  3 million a year, but would be unpopular with the public and strongly opposed by the dental profession.6.        It is very unlikely that it would be possible to legislate on NHScharges this session.   I have already asked for a place to be found inthe 1972-73 legislative programme for a Bill reorganising theadministrative structure of the NHS in England and Wales, but the proposed new charging powers would be so controversial politically that their inclusion in this Bill would mean that it would have a considerably moredifficult and lengthy passage through Parliament.    This would be unacceptable given that the timetable for reorganisation makes itnecessary to aim at securing Royal Assent by Easter 1973.   Thtt* if itwere now decided in principle to go ahead with legislation on charging,there would be a choice between including a second NHS Bill in theprogramme for 1972-73 and deferring action until a later Session.2
7. The questions for decision are:-1      Should the prescription charge  be increased to 22pfrom, say, 1 October 1972 under existing powers?2      Should legislation be prepared for the purposesdescribed in paragraph 4?   If so3      when should such legislation be introduced?As to 1,   colleagues will realise that there would be a great deal ofacrimony for a saving of  2-1 million a year.    But we would be preparedto make the necessary regulations if they are considered worthwhile.We would be in favour of a positive answer to 2.    As to 3, we would think it unwise to introduce such legislation except on the basis thatprescription charges are to be placed on a cost-related basis and increased.    We would not ourselves press a case for such legislation in the 1972-73 Session.K JP t department of Health and Social Security19 May 1972
