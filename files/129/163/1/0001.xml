S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENTn !*)CP(72) 51 COPY NO    &amp; *15 May 1972CABINETFIRST REPORT ON TOP PUBLIC SERVANTS BY THE top salaries REVIEW BODYMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. Lord Boyle1 s Top Salaries Review Body reported to the PrimeMinister on the pay of the Higher Civil Service, Senior Armed service officers, the Higher Judiciary and Nationalised Industry Boards on17 March 1972,    The Report provides for increases with effect from1 January 1972 at an annual compound rate since 1 July 1969 of 6. 8 per centon average;  8. 4 per cent at the bottom and 3, 9 per cent at the top.However, because they follow the first substantive review since mid-1969,they involve cash increases of  1, 000- 2, 500, and percentage increasesaveraging IT, 9 per cent and ranging from 22,2 per cent at the bottom to10 per cent at the top.    These are interim recommendations to be followedby a review in depth of each group with an operative date not before1 January 1973,    The recommendations are set out in detail in the annex to this paper (the Report was circulated with CP(72) 39).2. The Ministerial Steering Committee on Pay Negotiations has agreedthat the recommendations are acceptable in substance but has so far feltthat, while the Report and the Governments decision to accept it should be announced as soon as possible, it would not be sensible to do this yetbecause of the difficult situation on railwaymen,s pay, and in particular,before the completion of any ballot.3. I am now however coming under considerable pressure for anearly announcement.    The staff representatives, while continuing tobehave responsibly, are in increasing difficulties with their members;they have made it clear to me that they will soon be forced to launch apublic campaign over the delay in dealing with the Report.    We shouldnot under-estimate the difficulties which this could cause us.    There arealso other problems in delay - for example, most of the Higher Judiciaryare losing part of the recommended pay increase because the legislativearrangements required to implement it do not provide for backdating,4.        In these circumstances, I believe that the right course could wellbe to announce the Report and our acceptance of it without further ado.As we have found, there is never a good moment to announce pay increases1SECRET----- - -
of this kind, but the period of preparation for the railwaymen&apos;s ballot,while the dispute itself will be quiescent^ could present a good opportunity.(Richard Marsh might perhaps be invited to defer acceptance of theincrease in his own pay until the dispute in his industry has been resolved),5,        If we do not take this opportunity, further delay will be measured inweeks rather than days^ and there will be a growing risk that, apart fromawkward pressures for publication, there will be leaks of the contents ofthe Report,    These would inevitably highlight the cash increases in themost embarrassing way,6. The form of the announcement might most suitably be by an OralQuestion answered by the Prime Minister,    It would seek to emphasise the moderate rate of increase since the 1969 reviews;  the fact that therecommendations had been made by the distinguished outside body set up todeal with what is generally recognised as a difficult area;  and themoderation of the recommendations in the light of the outside salarysituation,7.        Asa second best, it would I think be possible to contain the pressures for publication if I could give the Staff Side some assurance thatthe recommended pay increases are not at risk.    I could do this by tellingthem, in confidence, that I can confirm that the recommendations will be implemented in full and from the due date.    In order to ensure that thisreduced the pressure on the Staff Side for some public militant action, itwould be necessary for this assurance to be passed on to a few key people,and it would then be possible that the assurance would leak.    This wouldnot however be particularly damaging, since we are publicly committed to accepting recommendations from the Review Bodies unless there are clear and compelling reasons for not doing so.    In any event, a leak of this nature would probably be much less damaging than a public campaign against the delay in publishing the Report,J civil  Service Department15 May 1972

ANNEX (continued)EXTRACT FROM THE TOP salaries review BODY REPORT26. d.    The Judiciary (continued) Higher JudiciaryLord Justice of Appeal and high Court Judge15,750Lower JudiciaryCircuit JudgeMetropolitan Magistrate9,7508,35027.      On an annual compound basis    since 1 July 1969* these recommendations amount to an overall average increaseof 6.8 per cent, with a range from 3*9 per cent for thehighest salaries to 8. 4 per cent for the lowest.    Onthe same basis, the upsurge of inflation during this periodhas increased prices by 7.7 per cent a year, while averagesalaries have risen by 11.1 per cent a year.    We aretherefore in no doubt that the interim increases werecommend are the minimum required if confidence in fairtreatment for the public service is to be maintained pendingcompletion of our substantive review.    In carrying out this further task,  on which we have already embarked, we intend to examine the principles which should govern the pay ofthose covered by our terms of reference, and to look afreshat the pattern of relativities.&quot;
