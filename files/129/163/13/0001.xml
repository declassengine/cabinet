DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 63 COPY NO21 June 1972CABINETICELANDIC FISHERIES DISPUTENote by the Secretary of State for foreign and Commonwealth affairs.        I enclose at Annex a paper prepared by my Department inconsultation with the Departments primarily concerned on the positionof our negotiations with the Icelanders.    It is important to reach anagreement if we possibly can because it is unlikely either that theInternational Court will grant us a standstill order now or thatwe shall win the case against Iceland.    The Law of the Sea Conferencein 1973 will not uphold a 12 mile limit.2. The point which might secure an interim agreement is this.The Icelanders feel that for political reasons they must have certain areas in which they alone can fish for certain periods of the year.I asked the Foreign Minister whether if some such area were concededthe Icelanders themselves would enforce a limitation on the size of fishcaught for conservation purposes.    He said that he felt sure that this could be done.    If this proves to be so, I think that on balance anagreement would be to our advantage.    The alternative of a fish waris horrible and has NATO repercussions.A D-foreign and Commonwealth Office21 June 1972
ANNEXIcelandic Fisheries dispute in his memorandum of 12 June (D0P(72) 30 ) the Secretary of Statefor Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs recommended that we should attempt to reach agreement with Iceland on the basis of an effortlimitation scheme restricting the number of fishing days by british vessels in the waters round Iceland,    Negotiations have now beenheld on this basis, but it has been rejected by the IcelandicMinisters.     They argued, quite without regard to the details of our proposal, that it would mean that British trawlers would continue tofish more or less as they have done hitherto.     They took no accountof our offer of a further reduction in total effort and insisted that, apart from any areas which might be closed on a non-discriminatory basis, there should be certain areas outside thepresent 12 mile limit which were closed to British trawlers but opento Icelandic trawlers.AREA LIMITATION2. The Icelandic Ministers did not at this meeting define the areasthey had in mind. They had previously proposed an arrangement underwhich -a. the whole area between 12 and 25 miles from the Icelandiccoast should be reserved for Icelandic vessels;b. the area between 25 and 50 miles should be divided into6 sectors which would be open, 2 at a time, for a period of4 months each to British vessels.During the present discussion they indicated in vague terms that theywere prepared to drop the 25 mile limit.    It therefore seems thatthe proposal we have to consider is that for a sector approachcovering the area between 12 and 50 miles from the Icelandic coast,coupled with non-discriminatory reservation of certain other areas.
3.    In addition to the question of effort limitation or arealimitation the following points have also been discussed -a. Freezer TrawlersThe Icelandic delegation have insisted on the importance of excluding freezer trawlers and factory vessels.    We have saidthat we have no factory vessels and are prepared to considerexclusion of freezers.b. Length LimitationThe Icelandic delegation have not repeated their originalrequirement that fishing should be limited to vessels under160 foot in length but have certainly not abandoned it.We have indicated that we could not consider a limitation of less than 200 foot.     (Apart from some of the freezers wehave only one vessel   over 200 foot in length.c. Traditional Fishing VesselsThe Icelandic delegation originally asked that fishing shouldbe limited to those vessels which had fished in Icelandicwaters during the past two years.     This has not beendiscussed during the present round.d. EnforcementThe Icelandic delegation have continued to insist uponIceland&apos;s right to enforce whatever measures are agreed upon.We have told them that we are prepared to agree to jointverification but cannot accept Icelandic enforcement,e. DurationThe Icelandic delegation have not contested that what isunder consideration is purely an interim arrangement pending a substantive settlement as a result of our reference to theInternational Court or by other means.     They have talked interms of a one year duration.     We have told them that thiswould be inadequate and that we should need 2 to 3 years.,2
COURT PROCEEDINGS4.     Our substantive case is before the International Court,    Icelanddoes not accept the Courts jurisdiction but we have asked the court to take the case, if necessary in Iceland1s absence.    We have alsowarned the Court that we may wish to seek an order on interim measuresto protect our fishing after 1 September.    No date has yet been aetfor a hearing on either point, but it we want to obtain an interimorder we shall need to start formal proceedings within the next fewweeks.NEGOTIATING PROSPECTS5.    We now have to recognise that there is no real prospect ofsecuring agreement with Iceland unless we are prepared to accept anarrangement based primarily on the reservation of certain areas toIcelandic vessels on a discriminatory basis.     It is possible thatwe might be able to secure a settlement on this basis withoutunacceptable prejudice to our fishery interests or to the principles on which our application to the International Court is based.    Weshould, however, seek to ensure that concessions were based upon theprinciple embodied in the United Nations Resolution of 1958 oncoastal fisheries which provides for preferential treatment of the coastal state in certain circumstances.     To this end we should need -a, to base an arrangement upon an alleged conservation need,flimsy though this pretext would be;b. to make it clear that areas were closed by agreementbetween the 2 parties, not as of right by the Icelanders alone.It might help us to secure a satisfactory agreement on this basis ifwe were to maintain a nominal catch limitation at the proposed figureof 185,000 tons, but we should withdraw the proposed effortlimitation.     There would be little doubt that an agreement would bediscriminatory in effect, but we should do what we can to make itnon-discriminatory in form.3
6.     So far as the other types of restraint are concerned, our negotiating position might be -a. We could offer either to exclude freezers or to excludevessels over 200 foot in length.     The effect -would be much the same.     The choice -would depend upon consultation withthe industry and with the Germans, who have a particular interest in freezers.b. We could not concede Iceland any right to bring british vessels to trial for offences outside the 12 mile limit.c. We should not agree to restrict fishing to vessels which have traditionally operated in Icelandic waters.TIMING OF NEGOTIATIONS7.     It is by no means certain that even with these concessions weshall be able to reach agreement, but they give us a fair chance andare indeed more than generous towards the Icelanders.    If we cannotreach agreement we shall have to go quickly to the international court to start formal proceedings for an order on interim measures.It therefore seems desirable to continue negotiations at ministerial level as soon as possible.     The Icelanders have proposed that negotiations should be resumed in Reykjavik next week.NAVAL PROTECTION8.    We shall not be able to decide finally upon the question ofnaval protection until we know the outcome not only of the nextround of negotiations but alsu of any application to the Court for interim measures.    Nevertheless, given that the time for preparation is now very short and that our negotiating stance is affected by the subsequent action we may be prepared to take,Ministers may now wish to consider the possible scale of naval protection and the issues&quot;it raises.     These are set out inD0P(72) 31.
