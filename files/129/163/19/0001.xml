DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT64CP(72) 69 COPY NO3 July 1972CABINETREORGANISATION OF THE NUCLEAR industry memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. Britain led the world in the introduction of nuclear power in the1950s, but recently, while other major industrial countries, not least inthe European Economic Community, have been installing nuclear plant ona large scale, our own experience has been very disappointing both at home &apos;and abroad.    Scientifically, our work in this field is of a high order, but our nuclear construction projects have met severe technical problems, our exports have been small and our nuclear industry is weak and unstable.2.        Some of our difficulties must be attributed to the way in which our effort is organised.    This memorandum proposes changes to strengthen it,along lines recently agreed in the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy (ES), subject to the Cabinet1 s endorsement.3.        At present, nuclear reactors are developed by the Atomic energy authority (sea), and designed and constructed for commercial use by twoindustrial consortia, while their fuel is manufactured by British NuclearFuels Ltd (BNFL), recently hived off from the sea.    The present structure of the industry is set out at Annex.    This structure hasshown three main weaknesses: two consortia are competing in a market which is too small to maintain more than one: consortiaare inherently unwieldy and hesitant in decision: and the divorceof reactor development in the sea from its commercial application in industry has been detrimental to both.4.        The ES Committee agreed that a remedy should be sought forthese weaknesses along the following lines:-a. The existing consortia should be replaced by a singlestrong company, which should not be a consortium but shouldbe under effective and unified management provided by a majorityshareholder.b. The new company should be encouraged to forge strong links with corresponding enterprises in Europe,
c. There should be a reallocation of responsibility betweenindustry, the sea, and the Government, under which the new company, instead of the sea as hitherto, would take the leadin formulating proposals for the development of reactors andtheir fuel.d. A Nuclear Power Board should be set up under Departmentof Trade and Industry control to improve co-ordination between the bodies concerned (chiefly the new company, the generating boards,the sea and BNFL) and to provide concerted advice to theGovernment on those major issues which would need to bekept under Government control,5. As to the identity of the majority shareholder mentioned inparagraph 4a. above, the General Electric Company (G.C) seemsthe only company in the private sector at present able to provide thenecessary resources and managerial ability: the only other solution would be to concentrate reactor design and construction in a public sectorbody, either the sea or BNFL, thus reversing the trend away from thepublic sector of recent years.    On balance, the ES Committee felt thatthe advantages of a commercially oriented organisation outweighed the risks of entrusting a further key industry to GECs control, provided we did not jeopardise our technical excellence.    The Committee accordinglyinvited me, subject to the Cabinet&apos;s approval, to hold talks with G.C, to explore the possibility of their setting up a company of the kind described in paragraph 4 above,6. If satisfactory agreement along these lines could be reached, someof its practical implications would be as follows a. The bulk of reactor development work would continue to bedone in sea laboratories, but the arrangements would give the new company a more direct responsibility in the specification and execution of the work.    For this purpose the company wouldtake over some 50-100 of the sea&apos;s key staff concerned withthe formulation and management of reactor development programmes,b. Later on, when the new arrangements are working,there may be a case for legislation enabling larger-scale transfers of sea staff and facilities to be made to the company.    But I do not seek to introduce such legislation at this7 stage.c. The new arrangements would not affect the sea&apos;s defenceresponsibilities, its, ability to give the Government expert advice on civil nuclear matters, or the research and development outsidethe nuclear power field which it carries out for various GovernmentDepartments.d. The new company would need to be linked closely to BNFL,perhaps through a shareholding, to link together the development and marketing of reactors and their fuel,
e. The change in organisation is in itself unlikely to have an effect on the level of Government funding for reactor R and D.This will depend primarily on future reactor policy, includingthe choice of thermal reactors, which is still under consideration,f. Safeguards would need to be worked out with the central electricity Generating Board to assure that G.C was not put ina preferential position for power station equipment outside the nuclear reactor (eg turbines, where Reyrolle Parsons are theirmajor competitor).7. I therefore invite my colleagues to agree that I should start talks with G.C and the other interests concerned, to see if satisfactory arrangements can be negotiated to establish a new company as described in paragraph 4 above.J d department of Trade and industry July 1972
ANNEX&apos;THE PRESENT STRUCTURE OP THE NUCLEAR industry      The UK Atomic Energy Authority (sea) employs 13,500 (excluding .Aldermaston), spends  35m on reactor R&amp;D, and a further  5m onunderlying research.   Its R&amp;D work is divided &quot;between two groups:-Principal Establishments Total StaffReactor Group Dounreay, Uinfrith, Risley, 7*550SpringfieldsResearch Group Harwell, Culham 5,4-502      British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL).
