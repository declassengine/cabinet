THIS DOCUMENT tS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(72) 59 COPY NO    g $13 June 1972CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND: A ROUND TABLE conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for Northern ireland. After discussion with the Ministers most closely concerned, I amseeking the agreement of my colleagues to entering into immediatepreparatory discussions with a view to a round table conference on thefuture of Northern Ireland.    It was one of the prime objects of theassumption of direct United Kingdom rule to create a situation in whichconstructive political discussions could be held under an impartialadministration.    Since 30 March we have succeeded in creating an atmosphere in which the various groups in Northern Ireland are anxiousto find a way out of the political difficulties that have beset the Province.I and the other Ministers in the Department have had individualconversations with a very large and representative body of opinion inNorthern Ireland, and I think that the time has now come when the varying political viewpoints must be brought together to see what common ground there is.    If we do not arrange this quickly we shall be in dangerof allowing our initiative to lose its momentum.2. I recognise that it is over-sanguine to expect that anything in thenature of an agreed solution will emerge from a conference within thenext two or three months, and it may be that there will have to be asecond, and wider, conference or that in default of agreement we shallhave to put our own proposals to Parliament for a new constitutionalstructure for Northern Ireland.    However, the first essential seemsto me to be to allow the various political groups in Northern Ireland tomeet among themselves to see whether the issues can be clarified andwhether there is any community of view that compromise could achieve.I therefore propose that in the first instance we should have a conferencelimited to political groups in Northern Ireland.    This means excludingfrom the conference the political Parties in the United Kingdom as awhole.    The Opposition may criticise us for that, but I believe that theneed to see whether the prople of Northern Ireland themselves can reach any common ground and the possibility of some wider discussions laterare sufficient answers to any such criticism.    It would, however, be important before any announcement is made to tal^e the Opposition into our confidence and secure their good will.1
3. The nucleus of the conference would be representatives of the recognised political Parties in Northern Ireland.    Whether other interestssuch as industry, the trade unions or the churches should participate is aquestion which I think is best discussed with the political Parties inNorthern Ireland themselves.    I envisage the conference as very muchtheir own conference and would want to be responsive to any ideas theymight themselves form as to the way in which it should be conducted.    Ishall also want to keep the Northern Ireland Commission in close touch,I have some confidence that the Social Democratic and Labour Party would agree to participate even though internment would not have ended at thetime of the announcement.    It would not be possible to include in theconference representatives of Sinn Fein;  the Unionists would not sit down with them, and it would be repugnant to public opinion in this country forthe conference to be attended by men who had so recently murdered or were still murdering British soldiers and innocent civilians.    There will be noseat at the conference for representatives of the Republic whether asparticipants or as observers, although we should try by giving theGovernment of the Republic prior notice to secure their good will.4.        If it is right to regard this as a conference for the people ofNorthern Ireland themselves, I think it would be inappropriate for the chairto be taken by any representative of the Government.    The Governor ofNorthern Ireland might be a possible chairman but we should also considerthe possibility of securing the services of some neutral person ofrecognised standing, whether associated with Northern Ireland or not.    Iwould not regard the function of the chairman as being to strive to reach agreement, but rather to promote a constructive exchange of views and to try to arrive at a series of issues which could be reported to theGovernment, and which would then become one basis for the Governmentsconsideration of the next move.    There might also be some security gain from an early conference in that it might take the edge off the tension inthe march season.5. The next question is whether any limitation should be placed on thetopics for discussion at the conference.    While I rule out as practicalcourses of action the early reunification of Ireland at one extreme and a return to the institutions of Stormont as they stood before direct rule atthe other, I do not think it would be right to exclude them as possibletopics of discussion.    We have said that Northern Ireland will remain inthe United Kingdom so long as that is the desire of the majority of its people, and we can hardly stipulate that the possibility of persuading thepeople to give their consent should be eliminated.    Moreover, it may well prove instructive to hear the views of those whose ultimate politicalaspirations lie in the direction of reunification.    There is a danger naturallythat unless certain topics are excluded, the conference will be boycotted by certain elements, but that danger is present and indeed greater if particulartopics are excluded from discussion.    The precise terms of reference ofthe conference are a matter on which I should judge it right to consult thosewho I hope will participate in the conference.2
6, Finally, there is the question of tLuing.    I believe that the current situation urgently demands an immediate political stroke, and that weshould at once enter into discussions with the representatives of recognisedpolitical Parties in Northern Ireland with a view to holding a conference ofthe kind I have described.    The question when the conference could be heldwould naturally depend on the degree of co-operation that could be secured in preparatory discussion; but there is every advantage in trying to hold the conference as soon as possible.    We could not permit a conference tobe held under duress from any section of the community and while wecould not make it a condition of holding the conference that all forms of violence and resistance to authority should come to an end before theconference is begun - for that would deprive us of the initiative - we havea right to ask for an end to violence, of civil disobedience and of the&quot;no-go&quot; areas, and the opportunity that a conference presents forconstructive discussion would provide a strong incentive to comply.    Bythe same token the Government would have to show a response and it mightbe that the situation immediately preceding the conference would permit theend of internment,7,        If my colleagues agree I would propose to announce on Thursday,15 June, my intention to enter into immediate preliminary discussions witha view to a conference;  and to include in this statement an announcementof our decision on the local elections on which I am circulating a separate paper.W WNorthern Ireland Office13 June 19723
