DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 75 COPY NO      (J 511 July 1972CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1976-77Memorandum by the Central Policy Review StaffINTRODUCTION1. The 1972 Public Expenditure Survey, on which the Cabinet will need to take decisions over the next two or three months, poses two kinds of issue:i. the overall size of public expenditure as a whole;ii. the priorities to be assigned to the different programmes and to the proposals for additional expenditure.THE OVERALL SIZE OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURE2. Any decision on the appropriate size of public expenditure as a wholemust be based on a judgment about the possible development of the economicsituation over the next few years, and on the priorities to be given to theGovernments other objectives, particularly in the field of taxation.3. The economic outlook is very uncertain:a. Unemployment has begun to come down faster than expected,so that it is difficult to assess the significance of the recent shake-outof labour.b. Nobody knows what rate of economic growth will provesustainable after the present slack in the economy has been taken up.c. The events of last month have brought the balance of paymentsback into the forefront of economic policy discussion,d. To find means of controlling the wage-cost-price spiral, bothin the short and the medium term, is probably the most serious problem of all,4.        In these circumstances, it is difficult to form a judgment on the besttarget for public expenditure.    As the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper(CP(72) 72) and the PESC report itself show, if existing programmes and proposals for additional expenditure were approved, the average rate of increase in terms of claims on real resources would be more than 4 per cent a year between 1971-72 and 1976-77.    Against the background described inparagraphs 5 and 6 of the Chancellors paper, a rate of increase as large as this would run the risks:1
a. that commitments to extra expenditure undertaken now might prove impossible to sustain, and involve difficult and unpopular cutslater on;b. that the Governments major objectives in the field of taxreduction and tax reform could be put in serious jeopardy.5.        If it becomes clearer over the next year or so that more resourcesmight be made available, there would still be time then to step the programmes up.    But to overcommit public expenditure at this stage couldseriously prejudice the Governments strategic objectives for taxation,public expenditure policy, and the management of the economy in the medium term.    The Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS) therefore recommends thatthe Chancellors proposal, ie. that the rate of growth of public expenditure should be limited to that of the existing PESC programmes, should beadopted as the basis for the current discussions.PRIORITIES WITHIN THE total. The main issues which will need to be considered if such a target is adopted are set out in paragraphs 17-20 of the Main PESC Report.    these include possible extra commitments arising from present policies, mostof which are as yet unquantified (paragraph 17), as well as proposals for extra expenditure which have not yet been considered by ministers collectively-    In considering each one, the following questions are relevant:1. Is the item of lower priority than the rest of its relatedprogramme which is not in dispute?2. If not, to what extent should the cost of the item be found from within the individual agreed programme, by dropping items of lesser priority ?3. If this proves impossible, do Ministers collectively considerthat its priority is so great that resources should be shifted betweenprogrammes to accommodate it?4.        If so, which programmes should be made to increase at as lower rate in order to achieve this?7. The Chancellor proposes that he and the Chief Secretary should examine with the Ministers concerned the problems of priorities entailed by their proposals.    It would be premature to take specific decisions aboutshifts of resources within the total at this stage.    When the next round of discussions between Treasury Ministers and their colleagues is completed,the CPRS would wish to report again, relating the outcome of thediscussions to the Governmenfs objectives and priorities as a whole.    Ifit is to do this effectively, the CPRS would need to be associated with such discussions.Cabinet Office11 July 19722
