IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1CP(72) 70 COPY no July 1972CABINETPOST-APOLLO AND FUTURE EUROPEAN SPACE PROGRAMMESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. The Minister for Aerospace proposes in CP(72) 71 that he shouldhave informal talks with the French and Germans about the possibilityof a more closely co-ordinated European space programme- It is farfrom clear what this would mean.2.        We know, however, that the French and Germans regard thedevelopment of an independent European launcher capability as essentialto a coherent European space programme.    Any offer by us to discusscloser co-ordination is likely to be taken as a sign that we are willing to reconsider our policy on this question.    For us to go back into theEuropean launcher business would be a complete reversal of the spacepolicy we have pursued in recent years.    This policy is based on the viewthat the cost of European launchers is out of all proportion to their value to the European Governments as users.    The cost of completingEuropa II and developing Europa III is now estimated at  270 millionwithout contingencies.    All experience suggests that the eventual costs will be much higher.    The United Kingdom share should be about one-sixth.3.        There is no reason to alter our policy in this matter and I therefore suggest that if there are to be talks about closer co-ordination, it shouldbe on the clear understanding that our policy with regard to launchersremains unchanged.    It cannot make sense for Europe, any more than for the United Kingdom, to try to compete with the Americans on all fronts.We are already considering collaboration with Europe in other fields of high technology - computers, aircraft and nuclear power.    If we were toget drawn back into the more expensive forms of space activity, we should only be limiting the resources we can devote to other objectives and for very little advantage.P JTreasury Chambers4 July 1972
