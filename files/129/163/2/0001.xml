/IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 52 COPY NO      6 315 May 1972CABINETTHE FUTURE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS TO the research COUNCILSMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal. The Green Paper, Cmnd 4814, A Framework for government research and Development, was published in November 1971.    It includedreports by Lord Rothschild and Sir Frederick Dainton.2.        In the foreword to the Green Paper we committed ourselves to three main points.    These were that research and development commissionedby the Government should be controlled in accordance with the customer/contractor principle;  that subject to this principle and its application tothem the Research Councils should be preserved under the Department ofEducation and Science; and finally that there should be a body ofauthoritative advice available to the Secretary of State for Education and science on the allocation of her Departments science budget,3.        Since the publication of the Green Paper argument has raged withparticular reference to the transfer of responsibility for funds going to the research Councils from the Department of Education and Science to the customer Departments.    This was the issue posed in table 4 ofLord Rothschildfs report proposing changes in the financing of theMedical Research Council (MRC), the Agricultural Research Gouncil (ARC)and the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC).    The ministerial committee on Science and Technology (SCT) has been unable to agree onthe scale of transfer of these fundss and I am putting this paper to theCabinet since a decision on this issue is necessary before we can draft theWhite Paper which has been promised for June.4,        I set out below the choices as SCT saw them.    But any solution has,I suggest, to take account of certain factors.    We have promised that any transfer will not be on a scale which leaves the three Research Councilsconcerned unviable.    We have to take account of the continued provision of funds for university researchc and we should need to be satisfied thatcustomer Departments who take over responsibility for sizeable funds hada proper chief scientist organisation to justify the application of the customer/ contractor principle.1
5. Lord Rothschild&apos;s table 4 set out proposals for transferring about half the  56 million going to the Research Councils in 1971-72 from theDepartment of Education and Science to the customer Departments.    Hisfigures were on a 1971 price basis, as are all the other figures quoted inthis paper and indeed as have generally been used in the public discussion.To avoid confusion we should keep discussion on this price basis.    Howeverwe must be clear that the actual figures would be different, and higher,because of the allowance both for growth in scientific expenditure and forinflation.6.        The broad choices would seem to be as follows:i, A transfer on approximately the lines recommended byLord Rothschild,    The customer Departments support this.    Itwould mean an immediate transfer for the first year of the new system (1973-74) of  28 million to the customer Departments,ii, A limited transfer of  10 million in 1973-74 to the customerDepartments.    This course is preferred by the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science,iii, A middle course involving a transfer of  10 million in thefirst year (1973-74) rising to  20 million in the third year (1975-76).These transfers do not include expenditure on the NatureConservancy, Institute of Hydrology and the Soil Survey as the futurelocation of these establishments has still to be decided.7. My own view is that course i. is too extreme.    It would arouseintense opposition from the scientific community.    The scientists wouldclaim that the consultation which the Secretary of State for Education and science and I have had with them had been meaningless.    On the other handI believe that course ii. is not a big enough transfer to be consistent withour stated acceptance of the customer/contractor principle.    I accordinglyfavour course iii,8,        We have to be clear that the figures in the event will be greaterallowing for growth and inflation, and it will therefore be necessary for officials to discuss, in detail, the actual figures and the split between departments.    We should have to accept that we were rejecting the viewsof the Select Committee on Science and Technology.    However they recommended no transfer at all until there had been further substantialdiscussions, and I do not see how we can possibly let uncertainty continue for a further period.    I have no doubt we should reject this recommendationof the Select Committee, while doing so with our eyes open.    Course iii,would provoke some criticism from the scientific community but I think itcould be allayed given the safeguards of the machinery for considering the science budget which are explained in the Annex,9.        I recommend that we adopt course iii.J civil  Service Department15 May 19722
ANNEXMACHINERY FOR CONSIDERING SCIENCE budget in futurei Customer departments would say how much work theywould commission from r.s..    This means that customerdepartments must be accountable for the sums transferredEven if the payments are shown in estimates as singleblocks, they must relate to an identifiable programmeof work which the department is prepared to commission,and it will be for the Accounting Officers of the customer departments to justify the sums paid tothe Councils and to be satisfied on the work-programmesthat make up the total payment.    The payments wouldnot be grants-in-aid.ii The Council for Scientific Policy,  reconstituted toinclude representatives from Research Councils andcustomer departments as full members, would take the size and nature of the work to be commissioned by departments into account in advising the Secretaryof State on the allocation of the DES Science Budget.It would be able to comment on the total funding ofthe r.s. and on the balance between commissioned workand that funded by the DES.iii The total funding of the r.s. would be consideredannually in the light of the CSP&apos;s comments by anew official interdepartmental committee (the research councils Budget Committee) under the chairmanship of the Chief Scientific Adviser,  which would reportto the Ministerial Committee on Science and Technology.This would not be a mechanism for controlling thetotal funding of the r.s.:    customer departments would decide how much work they wished to commission fromthe Councils,  and the DES science budget would continueto be controlled through the normal PESC machinery.But the new arrangements would ensure that Ministers,collectively,  are in a position to consider the overall effect of the new system on the Councils andto consider modification if necessary.
