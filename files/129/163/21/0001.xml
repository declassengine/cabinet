CABINETPOST-APOLLO AND FUTURE EUROPEAN SPACE PROGRAMMESMemorandum by the Minister for Aerospace1. On 11-12 July I shall be attending the Ministerial european space Conference in Brussels. This Conference will consideralternative future European space programmes (see Appendix A),&quot;but the most pressing matter is the response Europe should make to the American invitation to participate in the development ofa space transportation system which is loosely described as thepost-Apollo programme.2.     Since-.the offer of participation in the post-Apollo was firstmade some two years ago the attractiveness to Europe of this programme has diminished.    Economic pressures on the United states in this election year have led the Americans to make as much use as possible of existing technology to reduce costs and developmentrisks and also to undertake the maximum amount of work in theUnited States.3.     It is now. clear that the only work available for Europe is some  40M of subcontracting on the orbiter part of the shuttle,on terms which the Americans themselves recognise will be unattractiveto Europe, and the development of a space module to be used in association with the shuttle.    The development cost of the moduleis estimated at about  100M&quot; over seven years of which the UKshare would be about  20M.4.     The Americans are willing to see Europe undertake this workbecause they think it is largely within the competence of existingEuropean technology.    Access to new American technology would belimited.    European hardware &quot;developed to agreed specificationswould be purchased for the American programme but the quantitycannot be specified and is unlikely to be large.   At present, thepurchase price would exclude any amortisation of development costsbecause the Americans will not be amortising/their own development/costs
costs in charges to shuttle users.    But policy is under review and all the Americans can say is that charges to European governmentof the developed system will he on the same basis as for comparablenon-US Government users but the system will be available to alland there is no price differential to be obtained by participating in development.    The Americans are not in a position to say whatthe charges might be for European non-governmental users.5.     I therefore feel there are no economic or technical grounds on which I could press for participation by the United kingdom in the post-Apollo development programme on the present terms.6.     However, I expect in the western worldj&quot;a&quot;large future&quot;buildup in operational satellites in quantity, complexity and diversity.The French and Germans pursue a vigorous space programme aimed atsome commercial and political freedom of action.   We have todecide whether we can afford to isolate ourselves from thisEuropean activity and withdraw from space or whether we shouldactively seek to participate in and influence European spaceprogrammes.7.     The main problem for Europe is to decide how to ensure thatits satellites can be put into orbit.   Although the post-Apolloshuttle will be available to all.potential users there will, asin the case of conventional launchers, be restrictions placed bythe Americans on the purposes for which the shuttle can be used.We are disposed at present to think the Americans will launchsatellites for such purposes as the UK may require and have saidthat we are not prepared to contribute further to the cost of developing European launchers and would seek observer status inEEDO.   But some of our partners, especially the French, are muchmore sceptical because no clear assurance can be obtained fromthe Americans about launching future applications satellites.They suspect that&quot; if political or US commercial interests are involved difficulties will be put in the way of launches for european projects.    When considering possible European spaceprojects for the 19801s this is an important consideration.    Onthe agenda for the Brussels Conference there will therefore be theadditional question of whether to complete the ELDO Europa IIprogramme and to proceed with the development of the more powerfulEuropa III.8.     European space activities are at present largely ineffective,and dispersed between national and international programmes.    Inmy view one of the reasons why the Americans have so restrictedEuropean opportunity to participate in post-Apollo is theirscepticism in our ability to carry out our share on time withinagreed budgets.    This is d consequence of the present disposition of the European industry and the fragmented national policies the europeans have pursued.    (SeeAppendixB showing national budgetscompared with U.S.)     I believe much more co-ordination of effort- 2 -
is necessary if Europe is to make an impact on the space activitiesof the next thirty years.    I am convinced that, just as the UKcannot compete alone, so Europe should not&apos;continue to any purpose its present disparate activities.    I would have no interestin a new European programme unless this prior obstacle was overcome.9.     I have therefore had some discussion on a personal basis with my French and German^colleagues on the need for a more closelyco-ordinated European space programme.    I do not know yet if theFrench will respond to such conversations but the Germans have said they share my anxieties.    I have explained informally thatwe are likely to reject the post-Apollo proposals and that ifany positive proposals for a more integrated European policy areto emerge there is not time before the Conference of July 11-12.10.   It will obviously not be possible to resolve all the problemsbefore 11 July.   At all stages it will be necessary to proceedwith great care to ensure that there is a genuine political will to move towards the common objective, and not mere consent inthe expectation, particularly on the part of the French, of an&apos;unexpected bonus to the national interest.    If my colleagues agree that my suggested approach to a space policy should be pursued, I can do so with my French and German colleagues and either seek to take the minimum of decisions at my meeting on11/12 July or to postpone the meeting while these trilateral talkscontinue.11.   I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; agreement that:a) on the present terms we should not proceed with post-Apollo;b) that if no response is forthcoming to the present discussionsI have had with the French and Germans I should say &quot;no&quot;at the forthcoming conference;c) if a response is forthcoming I should continue my discussions on a totally informal basis and I should suggest to theFrench and Germans that, we seek to postpone the conferencewhilst we consider what, if any, purpose could be found inmore detailed negotiations.M.R.D.H.Department of Trade and industry July 1972
APPENDIX AALTERNATIVE EUROPEAN SPACE PROGRAMMESPaper by the Official Committee on Communications Space and ElectronicsOn 11 and 12 July 1972 the European Space Conference (ESC)will meet to decide on future European space programmes.2.     The Conference will note the agreement reached in December,1971, on the satellite programme of the European Space research organisation (ESRO).    This was a &quot;package deal&quot; under which the emphasis will be shifted from scientific to application satellitesand more concerted efforts will be made to co-ordinate national and international programmes.    The ESRO programme will cost011OM ( /4-6M) per annum from 1974- to 1980.    The UK contributionwill rise&quot; to about  9M per annum.3.    No purpose is served by the development and construction ofsatellites unless an assured means exists of putting them into orbit.The ESC meeting will therefore concentrate on future arrangements forlaunching European satellites.    In the short term up to 1980 theproblem is a limited one.    No difficulties have arisen about the availability of American launchers for scientific satellites.    the americans themselves are interested in the planned ESRO applicationsatellites except for two telecommunication satellites for whichlaunches will be required in 1978 and 1980.4.     The problem for Europe and the UK lies in the longer term beyond1980.   Significant political commercial and industrial interests canbe expected to emerge.   Eactors which have to be taken into accountare: . *(a) the Americans will have pressed ahead with their post-apollo programme.    The cost per pound of payload into orbit could bereduced by a factor of about 10 if the shuttle system were used tofullest advantage, the severity of the launch conditions will havebeen reduced, satellites will have become larger, more complex,maintainable (by visits etc), and many will be recoverable if need be.   This represents a difference in technological approach anda large change in cost versus performance.    It will make currentEuropean launcher technology obsolescent.(b) the enlarged European Economic Community will have beenin existence for a decade and it can be assumed that the over 300million people involved will seek the same authority and independenceas would be enjoyed by the other major blocs.(c) the market may change in volume and character.   An orderof magnitude drop in launching costs plus greatly improved performancemust be expected to produce a marked increase in the appeal of space versus terrestrial methods of performing tasks.   Big changesappeared in the case of Jet Aircraft, Nuclear Power, Computers,/Semi
Semi conductors and Telecommunications where the demand turned out to be much greater than the forecasters had predicted.(d) politically we gave offence to our partners (the e.c. lessLuxembourg) by withdrawing our support from the EUROPA II develop-ment programme.    The additional expenditure falling on France andGermany who want to complete the programme limits the funds theyhave available for other purposes.(e) in recent months the Americans have shown a growing(but understandable) tendency to protect their commercial interestsand technological lead.    In discussions on participation by europe in the post-Apollo programme the US have made it clear that any new technology it made available could only be used in that programme.Use of the technology for any other purposes would have to be negotiated separately on the normal case-by-case basis.(f) while undertaking to make US launchers available forsatellite projects which are for peaceful purposes and consistent with obligations under relevant international agreements and arrange-ments the Americans have maintained their view that regional tele-communications satellite systems, require a two-thirds majority vote in favour in INTELSAT and left unclear their attitude to futureoperational applications satellites which will have to have &quot;broadinternational acceptance&quot;.(g) recent difficulties with the Americans such as the lastminute hitch over the availability of a launch for the ESEO TD-1programme and the difficulty in finalising agreement between ESEOand the US on an aeronautical&apos; satellite programme have reinforcedour partners in their desire for some form of insurance in the shape of a European launcher capability.(h) recent discussions between French, German and british officials have shown a substantial agreement on the number oflaunchings Europe is likely to require in the decade 1980-1990.The total, for the European share of world-wide operational appli-cations systems, for regional telecommunications and TV, and forESEO scientific satellites appears to be in the range 35-^5 withthe French supporting the higher figure because of their belief in direct TV for that decade.    This estimate makes little allowance for increased demand arising from improved cOst/performance.(j) in the latest discussions the Americans made it clear thatthey were not prepared to discuss European development of a spacetug as part of the post-Apollo programme.    The only option open isdevelopment &quot;of a space module with possibly some subcontract workin the&apos;orbiter, but this would be subject to stringent conditionsbecause the US will be funding over 90% of the cost and cannot riskextra expense and delay arising from European subcontracts.(k) the Americans, do not intend to amortise the development/cost- 2 -
cost of the post-Apollo programme in their charges for use of theshuttle systems.   -There will he no preferential rates for customerswho participate in the development programme.    Commercial andtechnical reasons had no place in their invitation to Europe toparticipate in the post-Apollo programme.    The invitation was politically motivated and intended to bind Europe and America together in exploiting the vast potentialities of space.THE ALTERNATIVES5.     The policies open to Europe generally and the UK in particularare:i)   to withdraw completely from the launcher field and rely on american (and just possibly Russian) launching capabilityOn economic grounds there are compelling arguments why Europe should use US launchers exclusively, and the shuttle system after development is completed in the 1980s.    The cost of a European launch usingEUROPA II is around  10M (even if the development costs of over 250M are written off) compared with  3fM for an equivalent launchby the American (Thor Delta) system.    Shuttle costs would be evencheaper.    Added to this is the proved reliability of the Americanlauncher systems compared with the relatively untried European system.Under the ESRO package deal referred to in paragraph 2,satellites will be launched by either European or American launcherssubject to availability; priority would be given to the former withthe cost to ESRO limited to 125% of the cost of a comparable Americanlauncher.    If for any reason the USA refused to make launchingcapacity available for a specific ESRO mission the latter is empoweredunder the agreement to ^procure or develop European launch facilities at cost.The UK has accepted that the US assurances are sufficient toenable us to be confident of a satisfactory supply of launchers tomeet UK national needs and those for European programmes in whichwe expect to participate in the foreseeable future.    It still remains to be seen whether the US will provide launchers for the EuropeanRegional Communications satellite (they say they hope to answerbefore the July ESC meeting).   Eor future applications projects no clear answer can be obtained (such projects must have broad inter-national acceptance).    The French are highly sceptical about Americanassurances particularly when significant political, commercial or industrial interests are at stake.    They argue that European interestscan be impeded simply by prolonging the process of negotiation and administration, so that any tenders for a major commercial projectwould look less attractive than those of American competitors.    Sofar as UK long term commercial interests are concerned the credib-ility of projects requiring American launchers must be diminished ifthey are in conflict with US commercial interests.
ii) to maintain a minimum independent European launcher capa-bility in case American launchers are refused by completingEUROPA II development and uprating the vehicle with theaddition of boosters to give a 400 kg payload.The cost of such a programme would be about  150M (UK share from spread over 8 years).    Such a vehicle would not be commerciallycompetitive with US launchings even within current technology butthis would not be the overriding consideration if strategic or political issues were involved.This course would provide an insurance against most eventuali-ties, would reduce the risk of American refusal to launch Europeansatellites and provide a base for further development if this becameessential.    It does not necessarily -meet all possible requirements inthe longer term after 1980 when commercial competition involvinglarge satellites may develop.iii) to continue to develop EUROPA II and so on to develop aEUROPA III to ensure independence from non Europeanlaunching capacity for satellites of high industrialstrategic or political value.High development costs would be involved.    The presentSecretariat estimate without contingencies is  270M (UK share  54Mspread over 9 years).    It would be difficult to find suitable high quality work for British contractors and the finished product wouldbe archaic by the 1980s.Such a programme would give Europe the &quot;coherent&quot; space policywhich our partners seem to find attractive and, at a cost, wouldgive Europe access to most unmanned space activities.    The cost of aEUROPA III launching has been variously estimated at between  7Mand  14M and would not be commercially competitive with a shuttlesystem launching in the 1980s.iv) to co-operate with the US in the post-Apollo programme by developing a sortie module to be used with the spaceshuttle (and possibly undertaking some shuttle subcontracts).A sortie module is a pressurised structure designed to carryground-type laboratory facilities.    It will be accommodated in the60 ft long payload bay of the orbiter and remain attached to it during short duration (several days) orbital missions while itstwo-man crew conduct experiments in the fields of life science,space technology and materials, communications/navigation, earthobservations and astronomy/physics.The latest US estimate for development of a sortie module isabout  100M.    (UK share  20M over 6 years).    This is based on NASAin-house and contractor studies (cost 02M).    NASA are satisfiedthat a useful module can be developed for  100M but if design studiesin Europe showed this not to be possible the requirement could be/reduced.    - 4 -
reduced to permit *the development of a module within the financialceiling.    This might mean it would be less of an &quot;all purpose&quot;module which NASA are trying to identify.If specifications and price were agreed the US would undertaketo purchase or lease the module for a period of time and not to manufacture a comparable model.    The price would include no amort-isation of development costs.   The US would not undertake to abstain from other types of module development.    Technology passed to Europefor the programme cannot be used for other purposes except by special arrangements in each case.    The US does not intend to differentiate in charges for the use of the shuttle between those whoparticipate in the development and those who do not.Participation in the programme would enable Europe to keep abreastof space technology so that there would be sufficient skill and knowledge within Europe for a broader capability to be achieved somedecades hence if necessary.    It would enable designers of satellitesand systems (ie the users; to be prepared for the post-Apoiio era.A political basis could be provided for technological co-operationbetween Europe and the United States and Europe would play a (small)part in the management of the shuttle system.Some participation by European firms as subcontractors to USprime contractors for development of the orbiter is also possible.UK firms have been working with American prime contractors throughoutthe Phase B stages of the work, sharing the cost with the UK Government.They are anxious to participate in the development programme itselfbut this would require Government funding.    The total amount of workavailable is about  4-OM of which on a GNP basis the UK share over 6years would be  8M.    The Americans would apply stringent conditions for such work.    Europe would do little more than provide the funds fora programme, the management of which would be outside its control andif the cost of development escalated this would fall on Europe.    Therewould be some technological &quot;spin-off&quot; into aircraft of the future and european firms would be trained in US large scale management techniques.v) to undertake a programme involving some combination oflv above and ii or iii.The other European countries are quite likely to favour thiscourse.    They feel the future of space activity lies through theshuttle and would like to play a part in the /development programme.They also feel that it is politically and economically unwise tobe^wholly dependent on US launchers when only community of interest,which cannot always be guaranteed, would ensure the availability oflaunchers. . v
