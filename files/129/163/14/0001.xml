I am in full agreement with the Ministersmemoranda.CP(72) 64COPY NO421 June 1972CABINETJ d department of Trade and Industry21 June 1972
ICLMemorandum by the Minister for Industrial development at its meeting on 20 June, Economic Policy Committee discussedmy memorandum EPC (72) 34, attached, (Annex 2) about ICL.The Committee considered three options:-a      to accept a merger with Burroughs without effective UKcontrolb      to support ICL now with a view to a European partnership;c      to provide limited financial assistance solely for thepurpose of allowing other US, European and Japanesepartnerships to be explored.2       The majority view of the Committee was that the possibilityof retaining some UK control in a merger with a US company,other than Burroughs, or a Japanese company should be exploredand that the third of these options should be adopted.3      I believe there is no prospect of retaining control of aUK or European capability in any merger with a substantialAmerican or Japanese company.   I do not believe that anysignificantly greater influence could be secured than Burroughshave said they are prepared to concede.       I believe therefore that to adopt this third option is merely to defer the choice between the two real alternatives.4      Even if this option is adopted it will be necessary tomaintain confidence in ICL, as the memorandum before theCommittee from the Civil Service Department and CPRS (EPC(72)33)accepted, by means of an immediate statement announcing supportof  -14.2m up to September 1973.5      If this course were adopted,- our statement announcing itcould be a brief one saying that the Government has discussed withICL the finance required for the R and D programme necessary tomaintain the substantial capability that has been created in ICLand that we have agreed to provide the support of  -14.2m whichICL have asked for during the period up to September 1973*6      We should make it clear to the Company that we wish to seeall possibilities for partnerships explored more fully beforeentering into any further commitment.   We should however makenothing of this publicly since to. do so would seriously undermine the company.   A further statement would be needed within a few weeks after our further explorations since  14.2m as a contribution toR and D will not meet ICL&apos;s need for additional capital and thecurrent readiness of G.C and Plessey to subscribe further capitalmight well be prejudiced (G.C and Plessey have agreed to underwritea rights issue of  10m but only if linked with longer term support from the Government).7 I believe, however, that no new options will result fromthis course of action and that it entails considerable risks./A
A limited statement of the kind described in para. 5 may result in animmediate slide in confidence in ICL and a loss of morale within thecompany.   We announced in July 1971 that we were considering further measures of support.   Since then the Select Committee has recommendedsupport of  50m a year, a substantial proportion of which should goto ICL.   We have been known since February to be in discussion with ICLand there has been speculation in the press about the extent of our support.   Support for fifteen months only with no indication of continuing support thereafter may be seen by customers and creditors ashalf hearted, especially if it becomes known as it could that soundingsare being taken of potential partners.    The ICL Board may feel that the shareholders * long term interests would not be protected by such astatement and may therefore prefer to follow up the Burroughs bid.8      I strongly urge, therefore, the second option.described above andthat we should make a statement along the lines of the attached draft(Annex 1).     This course has the following advantages:-a     its indication of support after 1973 provides the continuitycustomers and others are seeking;b     it creates a position of strength from which to approach-potential partners - in Europe, in particular,    it goes someway to matching the French and German support programmes whichextend over four or five years and are on a similar scale;c     only this will enable us to obtain and announce now a commitment from G.C and Plessey to make a further contributiond     it does, not close any options including later withdrawalif we are not satisfied with ICL&apos;s progress, and exploring now or at a later date such partnerships as we may conclude can be reconciled with our national interests.9      conclusion recommend that we should:-i.     make an early public statement of support for ICL, along thelines of Annex 1;ii.     proceed with the meeting with French and German Ministers and discuss with ICL and its principal shareholders how best to explore urgently the possibilities of partnerships with USfirms, other than Burroughs, and with Japanese firms;iii.     undertake such explorations and report back.DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY C.J.C.MILLBANK TOWERLONDON SW121 JUNE 1972
Annex 1DRAFT STATEMENT ON ICLThe Government has decided, in the light of the Select committee report, to support the substantial R and JD programme of ICLwhich is necessary over the next few years if the company isto maintain its important capability in the computer industry.ICL&apos;s programme involves expenditure of the order of  20m a year.For the initial period up to September 1973 the Government has agreed to make a contribution of  14.2m which ICL accept willenable them to maintain their programme at the required level.The Government contribution in later years will be determined byICL&apos;s progress in various fields and in the development ofcooperation with other firms but the Government is, inprinciple, ready to provide support of the order of  10m a yearduring the period to September 1976.   Arrangements will bemade for the Government contribution to be recovered out ofthe profits the company are confident of making.ICL has in addition a need for further capital.   I am glad to be able to inform the House that G.C and Plessey, the major shareholders in the company, have agreed to -underwritea rights issue which will provide a contribution of  10m fromthe private sector.   The Government will also contribute a totalof  15m capital and I will make a further statement as soonas the detailed arrangements for the provision of this capitalhave been worked out.
ANNEX  2INTERNATIONAL COMPUTERS LIMITEDMemorandum by the Minister for Industrial development on 24 May, the Committee considered EPC(72)30 about support for International Computers Limited (ICL) and concluded that discussions should be held with the French and German governments and with the Burroughs Corporation about possible partnerships.2-     Burroughs.    I was asked to explore with Burroughs whetherit would be possible to reach a partnership arrangement whichwould maintain a British computer capability.   It is clear from my discussions (recorded fully in the Annex; that Burroughswould not accept any effective UK control and thus there couldbe guarantee of maintaining the capability we now have in ICL.3.     The French and Germans.     There is no prospect of a discussionwith the Europeans at Ministerial level until July.     It appearsthat there is political goodwill but awareness also of the immediate difficulties (see Annex).4. ICL&apos;s Present Position. Changes in ICL&apos;s position since EPClast discussed the Company&apos;s proposals are also described in the annex.     In summary:-a. The new Managing Director has put a new strategy to theBoard.b. The Board now feels that, given early government support,Burroughs should be resisted.c. The Board, in seeking Government support, is prepared to forego dividend payments for five years.   It has thus reducedits request for support, up to September 1976, to  50Mtogether with a loan of  25M at 2% interest and a guarantee of the Computer Leasings arrangements.5.     The Board believe that opportunities exist for partnerships,in Europe and elsewhere, that will strengthen ICL.   However, they also believe that they will be in a stronger position in a year or so to pursue these.   Even the Burroughs possibility will stillbe open to the strengthened Company in a year or so.   They propose,therefore, that an early statement of support from the Governmentshould commit the specific sums required only for a period of fifteen months (to September ^1973) with continuing supportthereafter to depend upon the level of the Company&apos;s performance upto that time.
6.     It is essential that the Government1s attitude be made clearduring June.     The Company&apos;s half yearly statement will revealpoor results and I agree with them that, without a credibleassurance of Government support, this will lead to ICL*s customersand creditors losing confidence.     ICL has already deferred itsstatement until 4- July in the hope that the Government1s position will be made clear.    The Company has been known to be in discussionwith the Government for some time.   It must know the Government&apos;position by 23 June at the latest.7-     Assessment of the Immediate Options.   Only two alternative courses of actxon are immediately open.     First, to accept a merger with Burroughs on the terms outlined above.   Second,to support ICL now with a view to a future European partnership.8.     The first would involve   no cost to the Government.    the disadvantages are the absence of UK control and the difficultyof reconciling a takeover by a US company with our aspirations inEurope.     The resulting rationalisation would involve substantially greater redundancies than those implicit in ICL&apos;s own plan.9.     I do not believe that other US partnerships, such as thosediscussed in the Annex, would be any more advantageous - a viewshared by Sir Arnold Weinstock.   If colleagues favour further exploration of an American solution     it will still be necessaryto make an early statement to maintain ICL&apos;s position meantime.10.   I should prefer to preserve under our own control ICL&apos;scapability, which is acknowledged to be better than any otherindigenous capability in Europe.   I believe, therefore, that weshould support ICL with a view to later European partnerships.Support now will still leave other options open to us in the future and I believe that the new Management of ICL is right in its belief that our bargaining position is bound to improve.11.   form of immediate Government Commitment.     To restore confidence fully and to maintain the momentum of ICL&apos;s R&amp;D,our statement must contain a clear commitment for the next four/five years.     But the Company has proposed that specific sumsshould be committed only for the period up to September 1973 and thereafter only in the light of progress against agreed milestones.We should have it clearly established with ICL that further support is dependent on satisfactory progress, though we should not make too much of this publicly.12.   G.C, encouraged by the recent management changes, have agreedto underwrite an increase in ICL&apos;s equity with a view it seems toultimate control of ICL.      Plessey have also agreed to consider a/contribution ..
contribution in some form.     It is my hope that this will reduce,by perhaps  10M, ICL*s need for finance in addition to the Government&apos;s 50M support for R&amp;D and that it will be possible to refer tothis in our statement of support.13.   Beyond 1976 we shall not be committed at all.   EPC(72)30suggested that further support of up to  50M could be required in1977 aud 1978 if ICL&apos;s sales forecasts for its New Range werenot achieved.    The new management are confident that these saleswill be achieved and that the changes in strategy and relatedimprovements in efficiency will enable the Company to stand on its ownfeet by 1976.     We shall be able to judge well before then what progress is being made by ICL and in the direction of Europeanpartnerships.14-.   I recommend therefore that our statement should be along thefollowing lines.   The Government has decided, in the light of theSelect Committee report, to support ICL&apos;s R&amp;D programme up to .1976 and to assist the Company to establish a basis for co-operationwith the European industry; the major shareholders, G.C and Plessey,have agreed to make a further contribution the exact nature ofwhich is under discussion; the programme involves expenditure bythe Company of the order of  20M a year, the exact government contribution depending upon the Company&apos;s progress and on thedevelopment of partnership arrangements; the Government is readyto provide support of the order of  10M a year during this period;and for the dnitial period up to September 1973 the Governmenthas agreed to make a contribution of  14.2M towards the Company&apos;sE &amp; D   recoverable out of subsequent sales.15*   Conclusion.    I recommend that we should:-a   decide now that the arrangement proposed by Burroughs is not acceptable;b   decide to support ICL, and to pursue further the possibilityof European partnerships and proceed with discussions with the French and German Governments;c   announce our readiness to support ICL over the next five yearsalong the lines of paragraph 14 above.C.

CONFIDENTIAL annexINTERNATIONAL COMPUTERS LIMITEDDEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE EPC MEETING ON 2k MAYBurroughs.1      I met Mr Macdonald, President of Burroughs Corporation, on 6 June.In discussion, Mr Macdonald conceded that Burroughs would he preparedto establish a Management Centre in or near London, which would hedirectly responsible to the Burroughs Corporation Board, for all theComipanyrs European and African operations.   Two directors on that board would be resident in London and responsible for the Management centre and one of these could be a UK national.   Beyond this, Mr Macdonaldwould be prepared to make a &quot;declaration of intent&quot; about futurepolicies in areas of particular interest to HMG viz:-i the maintenance of a significant level of R &amp; D in the UKconcerned with computer systems, and not just peripherals;ii any significant reduction of the Company&apos;s work force in the UK,and significant plant closures;iii the effect of Burroughs&apos; operations on the UK Trade Balance.Mr Macdonald promised meaningful consultation with HMG on such issues,hut said that he could give no guarantee concerning the Company&apos;future actions, which could only be determined in the light of commercialconditions as yet unknown.2      Although Mr Macdonald attached great importance to what he described as &quot;an intellectual centre in the UK&quot;, he made clear his viewthat overall control of the Company must he from Detroit.   He saidthat he would welcome a UK shareholding in Burroughs Corporation (solong as this did not represent a significant block of shares) andwould reluctantly he prepared to tolerate an arrangement for a minorityshareholding in a merged UK company; however, his approach to such arrangements is that they must not be allowed to restrict the company&apos; executive management.A European Partnership.3      In personal messages through our Embassies in Paris and Bonn tothe responsible French and German Ministers, I suggested tripartiteCONFIDENTIAL
onCONFIDENTIALMinisterial talks to explore the possibility of a broader unifiedEuropean effort in the computer field and, in particular, to discusswhether there is a basis for cooperation between the CII/Siemensgrouping and ICL.h      M Ortoli(the French Minister for Industrial and ScientificDevelopment) has acknowledged the advantages of European cooperationon computers but feels that the problems inherent in an associatibetween ICL and CII/Siemens could only be overcome by the firmsthemselves.    He has agreed to a tripartite Ministerial meeting inParis after bilateral Anglo/French talks at official level, but he believes that such a Ministerial meeting could only set the stage forinter-firm discussions leading to a series of step by step cooperativeagreements.5      Dr von Dohnanyi (the Federal Minister for Education and Science)has welcomed   my initiative and has agreed that further efforts mustbe made to bring about closer and stronger collaboration.    He has also suggested bilateral talks at official level to prepare for a tripartiteMinisterial meeting.6      M Ortoli&apos;s message hinted that the talks should take in a wider field than simply a tie-up between ICL and CII/Siemens.    Germanofficials have been more specific in discussion with our Bonn Embassyand have- referred to the place of Nixdorf/Telefunken and Philips inour thinking.    It seems to me, therefore, that we cannot now expectprogress towards the creation of a partnership in Europe in the shortterm and this is also ICL&apos;s view.    However/ nothing in these repliesmakes me believe that meaningful cooperation will not be possible inthe longer term.Other Partnership Options.7      Whilst we should not close our minds to partnership possibilities(with US companies in particular) other than those discussed inEPC(72)30, such possibilities must be more remote than those already under consideration.    The   j^^ii^jQ^^f1168 that might be regarded as
CONFIDENTIALpossible partners and their size in (terms of turnover worldwide are:-Honeywell/GE  750MSperry Rand Corporation o-rocu(parent of Univac)National Cash Register  587MControl Data Corporation  220M (includesturnover of anassociatedfinance/leasingcompany)(Burroughs  393M)(ICL  150M)Thus, none is of a size that gives any better prospect than Burroughsfor an acceptable partnership apart, possibly, from CDC.    But CDC hasrecently formed links with NCR and would not by itself add significantlyto ICL&apos;s market base (it specialises in very large machines for scientific use).    Moreover, none of these companies has shown any interest in a wide-ranging association with ICL.   Burroughs is tech-nically and commercially a closer fit than any of the others.ICL&apos;s Present Position.8      In EPC(72)30 I reported that the ICL Board then took the viewthat it would be in the best interests of the shareholders to explore the Burroughs proposal more fully.    Since then, the new managing director of ICL(Mr Geoffrey Cross, recently appointed from the UnivacDivision of Sperry Rand) has had the opportunity of examining theCompany&apos;s strategy and its weaknesses in management.    In the light ofhis examination and proposals he has made to the Board, the Company&apos;position is now as follows:- /a   The Board no longer feels that, given an early indication of support from the Government, the interest of the shareholderswould be best served by following up the Burroughs bid.b   The Board is also prepared to base its proposals for financial support from the Government on the assumption that no dividendsshould be paid for five years (except those,made possible bythe improvements in management and efficiency which Mr Cross
believes are possible) which enables the Company to reduce itsrequirement significantly.9      The Company is now proposing that grants in aid of its R&amp;Dshould be limited to  50M in the period to September 1976 but thatthis should be supplemented by a loan of  25M for five years at 2%interest (enabling them to reduce interest payments by a total of 5.7M) together with a formal guarantee of their Computer Leasingsfinancial arrangements which they believe will enable them to obtainbetter terms for those arrangements (saving  11.3M).    This would yield to the Company a total of  67M of assistance which corresponds to the figure of  107M in my earlier paper less the  hOM required to generate a profit out of which dividends were to be paid.
