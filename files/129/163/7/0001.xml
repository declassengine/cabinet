NORTHERN IRELAND:FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS AND LEGISLATIONIntroduction1. The purpose of this White Paper is to explain and provide background to a number of measures concerning public expenditure and taxation inNorthern Ireland which, under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions)Act will this year come before the Westminster Parliament, instead of being dealt with by the Northern Ireland Parliament as in previous years. It also provides an outline of the Northern Ireland Budget for 1972-73.2. Under the Government of Ireland Act 1920 there is a separate NorthernIreland Exchequer, out of which most Government expenditure in NorthernIreland is financed. The Northern Ireland Exchequer receives a share of reserved taxes, i.e. those taxes which are determined in Westminster for theUnited Kingdom as a whole. It also receives certain transferred taxes whichhave been determined in Stormont. The general principle governing expendi-ture and taxes has been parity of services and of taxation with the rest of theUnited Kingdom. Certain programmes, in particular those concerning the promotion of industrial development and employment, are related to, though not identical with those for the development areas. Since not only the majortaxes but also monetary policy and matters affecting international trade arethe responsibility of the United Kingdom Government, it will be seen thatthe Northern Ireland Budget serves a more limited purpose than the budget of the United Kingdom as a whole.3. At one time the revenues available to the Northern Ireland Exchequer wereenough to cover current expenditure and leave room for a contribution to imperial Services, principally defence and service of the National Debt. How-ever, equal tax rates produce a lower tax revenue per head in Northern Irelandthan in Great Britain. As expenditure programmes have grown in line with programmes in Great Britain, it has become increasingly necessary overthe years to supplement Northern Ireland tax revenue with a number of specialcontributions from the United Kingdom Government and also to provideloans to the Northern Ireland Government on an increasing scale to helpfinance capital expenditure, while the Imperial Contribution has become a purely token figure. Even so, the continued rise in development expenditure and reductions in tax rates have for some little time made it clear that somefresh and possibly more comprehensive means of supplementing NorthernIreland&apos;s tax revenues was likely to become necessary, and possible measuresof this kind were under discussion with the Northern Ireland Governmentsome time before the prorogation of the Northern Ireland Parliament. Con-sideration of this question has continued since then, and Parliament will beinformed when conclusions are reached.4. The following paragraphs contain a further description of the various aspects of the arrangements summarised above. Fuller details of expenditure,finance and economic matters are contained in three publications of theNorthern Ireland Government: the Estimates for 1972-73, the FinancialStatement for 1972-73 and the Economic Report for 1971*.* These are available in the Vote Office and the Printed Paper Office.3325899 A 2
DESCRIPTION OF FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTSExpenditure5. The Northern Ireland Government is responsible for most domesticactivities such as roads, transport, agriculture, trade and industry, housing,law and order, education, health and social services. Where applicable, forinstance in the case of social service payments, the principle of parity is preciselyfollowed; since, however, parity of services often cannot be determined exceptin the light of special circumstances (e.g. high levels of unemployment), itsinterpretation has in practice been a matter for discussion between the Govern-ments of Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom. Northern Irelandprogrammes have been brought within the scope of the Public expenditure survey of the United Kingdom and are included within the published figures.6. The provision for this expenditure has hitherto been made by the Parlia-ment of Northern Ireland under procedures which paralleled closely those used at Westminster. Under the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions)Act 1972, Orders in Council will take the place of Appropriation and Con-solidated Fund Acts. An Order already laid on 1st May provides for the appropriation of sums that had already been voted by the Northern ireland parliament at the time of its prorogation. These are an Excess Vote for1970-71, the 1971-72 Spring Supplementary Votes and the Vote on Accountof Expenditure for 1972-73. The Estimates for 1972-73 have been published;these, subject to certain adjustments referred to in paragraph 17 below, willform the basis for a further Appropriation Order in Council.7. Any new proposals for expenditure will be published in the form ofsupplementary estimates which will provide the basis of further AppropriationOrders.8. The Northern Ireland Parliament received accounts of the money that ithad voted together with the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor general for Northern Ireland on those accounts. The Public Accounts Committeeof the Northern Ireland Parliament considered these accounts and reports.The accounts for 1970-71 were before the Committee when the NorthernIreland Parliament was prorogued; the Secretary of State is now considering what further steps need to be taken. During the course of 1972-73 the accounts for 1971-72 with the report by the Comptroller and Auditor General for northern Ireland will be produced; it will be necessary in due course todecide an appropriate procedure for dealing with them.Tax Revenue9. Transferred taxes include betting duties, death duties, motor vehicleduties, stamp duties and selective employment tax. With minor exceptionsthese have been levied at the same rates as similar taxes in Great Britain.They are collected by Northern Ireland Departments and in 1971-72 produced 46 million.10. Reserved taxes include income tax, corporation tax, most customs and excise duties, and purchase tax. They are levied at the same rates throughoutthe United Kingdom and are collected by the Inland Revenue and customs and Excise, and paid into the United Kingdom Consolidated Fund.  The
1920 Act provided that the amounts attributable to Northern Ireland shouldbe determined by a Joint Exchequer Board composed of a Chairman appointedby the Crown with representatives from the Treasury and the Northern IrelandMinistry of Finance.11. At present, Northern Ireland&apos;s share of reserved taxes is determinedbroadly as follows:(i) The amount of income tax, surtax and capital gains tax collected from Northern Ireland residents;(ii) The amount of corporation tax collected in Northern Ireland. Incomputing the apportionment of corporation tax branches arejreatedseparately from their head office and adjustments (on an estimatedbasis) made accordingly.(iii) 2 - 7 per cent, of the total United Kingdom yield from reserved customs and excise duties and purchase tax (2 - 7 per cent, being the populationof Northern Ireland expressed as a percentage of the population of theUnited Kingdom).12. Deductions are made from Northern Ireland&apos;s share of reserved taxesin respect of the cost of the relevant reserved services, i.e. those provided bythe United Kingdom Government (tax collection and the Supreme Court ofNorthern Ireland) and in respect of the Imperial Contribution (see paragraph3). The balance, known as the residuary share of reserved taxation is deter-mined by the Joint Exchequer Board and paid from the Consolidated Fundinto the Northern Ireland Exchequer.Supplements to tax revenue13. The maintenance of the principle of parity has given rise to considerableimbalances between Northern Ireland&apos;s expenditure and the revenue provided under the 1920 Act. The level of incomes and family structure combine toproduce a tax yield per head lower than the national average. On the otherhand the level of expenditure tends to reflect the needs of an assisted arearather than the average for Great Britain as a whole. In consequence, as explained in paragraph 3 above, the Imperial Contribution has been reducedto a token level and the following specific measures have been taken: (i) National Insurance, Industrial Injuries and Redundancy Funds.Contributions and benefits are identical as between Great Britain andNorthern Ireland. Financial adjustments are made each year inorder to equalise the reserves per contributor in the separate Funds;although the arrangement is reciprocal, the net payment has been infavour of Northern Ireland and was  21 - 5 million in 1971-72 and for1972-73 is estimated at  28 million.(ii) Health Services Agreement.This provides that 90 per cent, of the amount by which the cost ofhealth services in Northern Ireland exceeds two per cent, of the total united Kingdom cost is paid from the United Kingdom consolidate fund to the Northern Ireland Exchequer. In 1971-72 the payment was  19-8 million and the estimate for 1972-73 is  25 million.
(iii) Social Services Payment.Under the 1971 Finance Act up to the whole cost of family allowances,supplementary benefits and some other social service benefits may bepaid to the Northern Ireland Exchequer from the United KingdomConsolidated Fund. In 1971-72 the payment was  40-3 million.The estimate for 1972-73 is  41 million.(iv) Regional Employment Premium.Similarly, up to the whole of the cost incurred by the NorthernIreland Government in paying Regional Employment Premium maybe met from the United Kingdom Consolidated Fund. In 1971-72the payment was  10-8 million. The estimate for 1972-73 is  11million.(v) Agricultural Payments.The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food provides theNorthern Ireland Exchequer with money to pay a grant, about  million a year at present, to Northern Ireland farmers in compensationfor their remoteness from the main United Kingdom markets.14. In addition to the special payments referred to above, the subsidiespaid to farmers in Great Britain are also paid by the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food to farmers in Northern Ireland as a part of the system of supporting and regulating agricultural markets in the United Kingdom as awhole. Northern Ireland also borrows for capital purposes from the national loans Fund.15. The special payments and the subsidies referred to in paragraphs 13 and14 above amounted in total to  124-8 million in 1971-72 and are expected toreach  133 million in 1972-73. Lending to the Government of NorthernIreland from the National Loans Fund amounted to  65 million (gross) in1971-72 and is expected to be greater this year see also paragraph 31 below.In considering these figures it is necessary to bear in mind that the assisted areas of Great Britain receive parallel financial flows though in their case,because there is no separate government, the amount is less explicit.CURRENT FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTS1971-7216. The Northern Ireland Budget for 1971-72 forecast total revenue of 422-9 million and the expenditure provisions left  8-9 million available for supplementary Estimates. Supplementary Estimates in fact amounted to 26-9 million, mainly for public service pay increases and for costs directly or indirectly arising from the civil disturbances. An extra  2 million was also required for interest payments. Of the additional  20 million  6 million was met by general underspending,  6 million by the use of a ResiduaryShare adjustment (instead of voted monies) for payment to the CapitalPurposes Fund and  8 million by increased revenue, in particular by increased payments from the Treasury towards increased expenditure on social services and by an increase in miscellaneous revenue. As a result it waspossible to deal with the finances of 1971-72 without any significant recourse tothe reserves in the Capital Purposes Fund which on 31st March 1972 totalled 13-7 million.
(i) Expenditure17. The Estimates prepared by the former Government of Northern Irelandtotal nearly  418 million or  32-3 million more than the actual expenditurelast year. Some items included in the Estimates, such as ministers&apos; salaries and certain parliamentary expenses, will not be required because of the operationof the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972, but these itemsrepresent only a comparatively minor sum ( 68,500). It is expected that substantial additional requirements will arise during the year from publicservice pay awards and from new measures to counter the effect of civil dis-turbances and to assist the economy. Two such measures have already beenmade public: help for the Belfast shipyard and a scheme of assistance towardsthe rates of certain city-centre businesses where trade has suffered especially from violence and the threat of violence.18. It is likely, therefore, that the increase of expenditure over 1971-72 will exceed  32-3 million. Since, however, it is not possible to make any accurateforecast of the total of additional requirements or to anticipate the means of financing them, the budget presented now is based on the original SupplyEstimates subject to the adjustments discussed in this paper.* Towards theadjusted cost of Supply Services of  391-7 million, provision of  140-8 million was contained in the Appropriation order&quot; the balance of  250-9 million will be covered in Appropriation Order No. 2.19. In addition to Supply expenditure there will be an increase of  4-5 million in Consolidated Fund expenditure mainly on interest. This however ismore than balanced by a corresponding increase in interest received on loans.20. Two final items on the expenditure side of the account must be mentioned:reserved services will increase by  700,000 and the Imprtisl Contribution is reduced from  1 million to  500,000.(ii) Revenue21. In reserved revenue there is an increase of  7-4 million compared withlast year, this being the result of buoyancy of  27 -1 million offset to the extentof  19-7 million by United Kingdom tax changes.22. Receipts from H.M. Treasury in respect of Health Services, social services, Agriculture and Regional Employment Premium will amount to 80 million, an increase of  7 - 5 million.23. Transferred taxation after allowing for the changes proposed shows areduction of  8-7 million mainly attributable to last year&apos;s reduction inSelective Employment Tax.24. Transferred non-tax revenue shows an increase of  5 million over lastyear&apos;s outturn mainly arising from interest on loans.25. Taken together all items of revenue are expected to result in receipts only 11 million higher than the outturn of 1971-72.* The figure of  418 million for Supply Services in paragraph 17 reconciles with that of 391 -7 million in the summary table on page 10 after the deduction of  68,500 (paragraph 17)and  26-2 million (paragraph 32).t The Appropriation Northern Ireland Order 1972.

S.I. 1972, No. 671 (N.I. 2).
Tax Changes26. The only changes of significance which are proposed in transferredtaxation refer to estate duty and stamp duties. In each case the changesrepresent parity with changes which are being introduced in Great Britain.27. In estate duty the exemption limit will be raised from  12,500 to  15,000and a revised scale introduced. Property as follows will also be left out of account for estate duty: if left to a surviving spouse up to  15,000; to charitiesup to  50,000; and without limit if left to certain bodies concerned with the conservation of the national heritage, including the Ulster Museum and the ulster Folk and Transport Museum.28. It has been the practice to apply changes such as these to deaths occurringafter the Northern Ireland Budget Day. On this occasion, however, it isconsidered appropriate that the changes should apply to deaths occurringafter 21st March, as in Great Britain, because the additional exemption maybe very large in particular cases and because the operation of the doubletaxation arrangements might otherwise result in serious difficulties where, asoften happens, a Northern Ireland estate contains considerable assets in GreatBritain which are also subject to estate duty in Great Britain.29. Under stamp duty there is one change of significance. It is proposedto increase the limits for exemption and half-rate duty on the transfer ofproperty other than stocks and shares. The limit for exemption will be raised from  5,500 to  10,000 and for half-rate duty from  7,000 to  15,000.These changes will operate from 1st August.30. The effect of all these changes will be to reduce estate duty by  450,000in 1972-73 and  900,000 in a full year and stamp duty by  90,000 this yearand  140,000 in a full year.31. These changes will be effected by an Order in Council which will also include minor provisions relating to estate duty, stamp duty and vehicle excise duties and any changes which may be suggested by amendments to the finance bill at present before Parliament.(iii) Balance of Revenue and Expenditure32. The increases in total expenditure and revenue discussed in the precedingsections amount to  37 million and  11 million respectively. It is thus notpossible for supply expenditure to be met from revenue to the same extent asin last year&apos;s Budget. It is proposed to provide for this by altering the patternnormally followed in the past between expenditure met from revenue and thatfinanced by borrowing. Nearly all capital expenditure (except for on-lendingto local and public authorities) of the Government has normally been met from revenue and the Estimates as originally printed provide for  76 - 9 million of such expenditure. Alternatively it would be feasible to meet such expenditure by borrowing as in the case, for instance, of a local authority and there arestatutory powers for this to be done if required. This procedure is simplified inthe case of Northern Ireland by the existence of a Capital Purposes fund which also permits credits to be stored for use in later years; these balances,totalling  13-7 million at the end of 1971-72, can be run down as an alternative to payments from Vote.  In order therefore to bridge the gap between revenue
and expenditure, as customarily assessed, the figures in the Financial Statementassume that some  26 - 2 million of capital expenditure shown in the Estimateswill instead be met from the Capital Purposes Fund balances or be charged toborrowing.(iv) Borrowing33. Apart from any additional requirement arising from the Budget theNorthern Ireland Government would have required to borrow in 1972-73 some 87 million mainly for on-lerding to local authorities and public corporations.The figures presented above increase this figure to  113-2 million; a largeproportion of this will come from the National Loans Fund.34. The Ulster Savings Movement will continue vigorously to mobilise thesmall savings of the people. The Secretary of State has given assurances thatthe two separate Northern Ireland savings securities will continue to be issued,that the money raised will still be put to use in the development of NorthernIreland and that the security of these investments is in no way diminished bythe operation of the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972.35. The Northern Ireland Government makes loans to Northern Ireland local and public authorities on lines very similar to those which operate in GreatBritain; each authority is entitled to a quota of government loan and can rely on the government as a lender of last resort if further requirements cannotbe met in the market. These arrangements will continue. Lenders in. themarket can therefore be assured that when the time comes for repayment the borrower will have access if necessary to government funds. Moreover, theSecretary of State has powers which he is prepared to exercise to take over anddischarge the functions of a local authority if it is unwilling or unable to perform them itself. .
