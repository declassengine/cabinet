DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 68 COPY NO      g 26 June 1972CABINETDEFAULT ON THE HOUSING FINANCE bill memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretary of State for wales. There maybe trouble over implementing the Housing finance bill.    We face two main threats -i.    When the Bill comes into force - which we hope will benot later than 8 August - certain local authorities maya. refuse to increase the rents of their dwellings on1 October 1972 as they are required to do, b. refuse to assess fair rents for their dwellings, and c. refuse toapply the national rent rebate scheme to their tenants from1 October 1972.ii.    Where an authority does make the prescribed rent increases on 1 October 1972 (and applies the rebate scheme from that date), some of their tenants may refuse to pay theincreased rent.2.        As regards the second (less immediate) threat, it seems likely that there will be &quot;rent strikes&quot; in a number of authorities.    But webelieve that if we give such authorities reasonable latitude, they will themselves be able to bring this type of situation under control by amixture of firmness and patience.    The Greater London Council usedsuch tactics with success in overcoming an extensive rent-strike after they increased rents in 1968.    If an authority however failed to regaincontrol either because they sympathised with the tenants or throughincompetence, we could, in the last resort, do the job for them byappointing a Housing Commissioner under the Bill.3.        As regards the first (more immediate) threat, the Labourauthorities are holding a conference on 8 July to try and determine theirattitude.    We shall not however know finally until after the Bill comes into force which of the authorities who are now talking of defaulting on theBill will in fact do so.    At that stage we shall be able quickly to identify the real would-be defaulters through our departments  informal contacts with local authorities.    The acid t*st will be whether the authority is1
preparing to send out notices of the rent increases required on 1 October,which by law have to go out at least 4 weeks before the increase falls tobe made.    When it is clear that an authority will not send out such notices,we propose to take the preliminary step leading to a default order which is laid down in the Bill, viz to send to the authority a notice informing themthat we are considering making a default order against them.    Theauthority then have one month to make representations.    This period would not in practice expire until about 25 September.    If, after itexpired, the authority persisted in their default, we would propose, after consulting our colleagues, to make a default order under the Billrequiring them to take specified steps within a specified period to remedy the default.4.        If a default order is made and the defaulting authority do notremedy the default we have in practice the following options -i.     To make an order appointing a Housing Commissioner to remedy the default.ii.     To reduce, withhold or discontinue housing subsidies(after giving the authority time to make representations onthe proposal to do so).iii.     To direct that an extraordinary audit should be held.(The object of this step would be to enable the district auditorto make more quickly any surcharge on the councillorsresponsible for the default to which they may have renderedthemselves liable - whether a district auditor surcharges acouncillor is a matter for him, not for the Secretary of State).Although theoretically default might be remedied otherwise than through a Housing Commissioner, the alternative remedies, eg mandamus, arelikely in practice to be too slow or uncertain in their ultimate outcometo be suitable in this particular situation.5. If an authority do not themselves remedy the default, we are ineffect committed to taking at least one of the measures in paragraph 4.But we can decide in the circumstances of each case both our choice ofmeasure and the timing.6.        We believe that we can influence the attitude of potentialdefaulting authorities between now and the coming into force of the Bill.Leaders of the Labour Groups of some 90 local authorities, includingthe major Lab our-controlled county boroughs, met on 10 June atSheffield, decided that implementing the Bill would be contrary to LabourParty principles and agreed, after more detailed study by a working party,to discuss this issue further at a conference on 8 July at Transport House.Informal enquiries made by the Department of the Environment suggestthat a number of major Labour-controlled authorities (includingManchester) will in the event implement the Bill whatever the outcome of2
the Conference on 8 July.   They will be encouraged to do so by theLabour Party front bench spokesman on housing.    Steps have also beentaken to ensure, as far as possible, that the full legal implications ofdefault are brought home to the participants in that conference.    In our judgement many potential defaulters will not commit themselves to defaultif they are once convinced that the Bill, and the rent increases required under it, will not be postponed as a result of pressure from theOpposition or other quarters.    The Minister for Housing and Constructionmade it clear in a speech on 23 June that we do not intend to postpone ormodify the Bill precisely because, in addition to dealing effectively with our housing problems, it reduces inflationary pressures by the help to lower-paid workers which will become available through thenational scheme of rent rebates and allowances.    We suggest that weshould publicly reiterate this theme in the next few weeks, and make it plain to the Trades Union Congress if they should raise the issue in any private discussions.7.        We invite our colleagues to agree that -i.    We should publicly emphasise our determination toproceed with the proposals in the Bill on the basis outlined in paragraph 6 above.ii.    When the Bill comes into force, we should take thepreliminary steps leading to a default order outlined inparagraph 3 above and report on the response to enableour colleagues to consider whether any default order shouldbe made.P WP t department of the Environment26 June 19723
