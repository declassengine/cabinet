M .40INTERNATIONAL LABOUR conference the decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on two Conventions and two recommendations adopted by the International Labour Conference at its56th Session 1971 are set out below. The texts of the instruments are sel/in the annex to this paper. ,      rCONVENTION NO. 135 AND RECOMMENDATION NO. 143 CON-CERNING PROTECTION AND FACILITIES TO BE AFFORDED to workers&apos; REPRESENTATIVES IN THE undertaking the Convention supplements the Right to Organise and Collective &apos;Bargaining Convention 1949, which provides for protection of workersagainst acts of anti-union discrimination in respect of their employment,by extending specific protection to workers&apos; representatives. It also provides for facilities to be afforded to workers&apos; representatives toenable them to function effectively, within the industrial relations systemof their country and without impairing the efficient operation of their undertaking. It covers both trade union representatives and representativeselected by the workers Tor activities other than those recognised as the exclusive prerogative of trade unions. Where trade union representatives and elected workers&apos; representatives exist in the same undertaking stepsmust be taken to ensure that the position of the trade union! is notundermined and that co-operation is encouraged. Effect may be givento the Convention by national laws or regulations, collective bargainingor other methods consistent with national practice.The Recommendation supplements the Convention by suggesting detailedmeasures (where ti ^se are not already available to all workers) for the protectionJo^workers&apos; representatives and their extension to candidates for election and tothose who have ceased to function as workers&apos; representatives. Similarly it listsa wider and more detailed range of facilities which should be afforded to workers&apos;representatives, such as time off with pay both for activities within the under-taking and for training, trade union meetings, seminars and conferences; access to management and to all parts of the undertaking required by their duties;facilities for collecting union dues, for posting notices and for distributingliterature; material facilities and information; and access to the undertaking for representatives not there employed of trade unions which have members there.The law and practice in the United Kingdom are in accord with the require-ments of the Convention and the Government propose to ratify it and accept theRecommendation.CONVENTION NO. 136 AND RECOMMENDATION NO. 144 CONCERN-ING PROTECTION AGAINST HAZARDS OF POISONING ARISINGFROM BENZENEThis Convention is designed to regulate the conditions under which work involving exposure to the dangers of benzene poisoningHs carriedout. It applies to all activities involving exposure of workers to benzene or
products containing more than I % by volume of benzene. It calls forI he substitution, exeept in certain named processes, of less harmfulproducts where available, and for the prohibition of the use of benzeneor products containing it in certain work processes including at leasttheir use as solvents or diluents, except where carried out in an enclosedsystem or where there arc other equally safe methods of work.The Convention also calls for occupational hygiene or technical measures for the protection of workers exposed to benzene or to products containingit. These include limitation of the concentration of benzene in the air of work-places, and the use of enclosed systems and the provision of personal protection against skin contact. It also requires periodical medical examination of workersexposed to benzene or products containing it and the total prohibition ofcxpec-tant and nursing mothers and, with sonic exceptions, of young persons under 18from work involving such exposure.The (iovernnu-iil are in favour of most of I ho provisions of Ihe ( munition.However, it is wider in scope than existing legislation in I he United Kingdom,which exercises control at present in premises to which the Factories Act l%lapplies. Proposed regulations to prohibit the use of benzene as a solvent will apply only in those premises, although consideration is also being given to themaking of similar regulations under the Offices, Shops and Railway PremisesAct 1963. It is considered that the proper application of these measures wouldmake periodic medical examinations and the absolute ban on the classes ofpersons specified in the Convention unnecessary. The Government do not therefore propose to ratify the Convention.The Recommendation supplements the Convention by recommendingprohibition of the sale of certain industrial products containing benzene, and byfuller and more detailed recommendations as to control and protective measures.For example, the provision of appropriate work clothes and of washing, changingroom and eating facilities; the prohibition of the use by workers of productscontaining benzene, for cleaning their hands or work clothes; the banning offood from areas where such products are manufactured, handled or used; and education and publicity on the hazards of benzene and protective, preventiveand first aid measures.The Government also support many of the provisions of the Recommenda-tion and recognise that the standards laid down in both instruments may serve as a useful guide where protective measures are at present minimal or non-existent. There are however in the Recommendation obstacles to acceptanceadditional to those which prevent ratification of the Convention, such as forexample the absence of powers under the Factories Act to prohibit sales ofindustrial products containing benzene, although on the other hand,, theproposed regulations contain stricter measures than those contained in theRecommendation. The Government therefore do not propose to accept theRecommendation. ,2

The duration of exposure should be limited as far as possible.10. Every worker exposed to benzene or lo products containing benzeneshould wear appropriate \vork clothes.II. The use of benzene or of products containing benzene by workers forcleaning their hands or their work clothes sliouki be prohibited.    w12.

Medical Measuresi15. (1) Workers who are to be employed in work processes involvingexposure to benzene or to products containing benzeneshould undergo (a) a thorough pre-employment niedical examination for fitness for employment&apos;   which should include a blood*test,*vl &apos;    &apos; 11(b) periodic re-examinations, which should include biological tests including a&apos;&apos;   blood-test, at intervals,&apos; of not more than one year, fixed by national laws&quot;or regulations. -       ;&apos; V -

In appropriate positions in premises in which benzene or productscontaining benzene are used, notices should be displayed which indicate-r(a) the hazards;(/;) the preventive measures to be taken;(c) the protective equipment to be used;(d) fust-aid measures to be taken in cases of acute, benzene poisoning.VII. General Provisions25. Each Member should (fir) by laws or regulations or. any other method consistent with national practice and conditions, take such steps as may be necessary to give effect to theprovisions of this Recommendation;(b) iii accordance with national practice, specify the person or persons on whom the obligation of compliance with the provisions of this Recommen-dation rests;(r) provide appropriate&apos;inspection services for the purpose of supervising theapplication of the provisions of this Recommendation, or satisfy itself that appropriate inspection is carried out.   t: .   &quot;26. The competent authority in each country should actively promoteresearch into harmless or less harmful products which could replace benzene.27. The competent authority should establish a statistical system for report-ing data concerning medically observed.cases of benzene poisoning and these should be published annually.The foregoing is the authentic text of the Recommendation duly, adopted.by the General Conference of the International.Labqur Organisation duringits Fifty-sixth Session which was held at Geneva and declared closed the twenty-third day of June 1971. .IN FAITH WHEREOF we have appended our signatures this thirtieth dayof June 1971.&apos; The President of the Conference,PIERRE WALINE &apos;The Director-General of the International Labour Office,WILFRED JENKSPrinted in England for Her Majesty&apos;s Statione^OtfTcg by Ederi Fisher Ltd.
