DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 58 COPY NO   g 412 June 1972CABINETPAKISTAN AND BANGLADESHMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department and the Secretary of State forForeign and Commonwealth affairs.        At our meeting on 3 February (CM(72) 5th Conclusions, Minute 2)the Home Secretary was invited to arrange for a study of the status of citizens of Pakistan and people belonging to Bangladesh.    Since our meeting, it has become clear that Pakistani withdrawal from theCommonwealth should be treated as final, and Bangladesh has been admitted to the Commonwealth.2. Now that Bangladesh has acceded to the Commonwealth, it wouldin our view be most desirable to clarify the status in our law of peoplebelonging to Bangladesh.    The effect of the British Nationality Act, 1948,is that they remain Commonwealth citizens in our law only so long as theyremain citizens of Pakistan in Pakistan law and so long as Pakistancitizens remain Commonwealth citizens in our law.    They might becomealiens at any time through action taken by Pakistan, over which we wouldhave no control.3.        A Bill should therefore be prepared urgently for introduction this session to make such changes in our law as are necessary in consequenceof our recognition of Bangladesh and her admission to commonwealth membership.    One of its main provisions would be to amend the british nationality Act, 1948, to provide that citizens of Bangladesh areCommonwealth citizens.4. Pakistani withdrawal from the Commonwealth must now beaccepted and we have to consider what legislative action is needed.    Webelieve that we shall have to have a Bill - but not this session - in which,after consultation with the Government of Pakistan, we could covercommercial matters, Commonwealth preference, professional qualifications and a number of other points.    The preparations of such aBill will be complicated, involving nationality and related issues whichare potentially contentious, and will take some time to resolve.    a thorough study of the problems involved should be made by officials anda report submitted to Ministers with recommendations.1
5. Meanwhile there is the awkward political question whether ornot we should take any positive action now to preserve the position of pakistan citizens resident here, for example, by legislating as partof the Bangladesh Bill that, for a period of say 12 months, they would continue for all purposes to be treated as Commonwealth citizens.The arguments for so doing are to remove any doubts there may be in the minds of such Pakistani residents about their present status;  to make clear their continued right to be registered as electors next autumn andto vote at elections; and to demonstrate that action to change the status of Pakistanis is intended.    But the Attorney General has given it as hisopinion thr.  temporary provisions to preserve the position in this senseare not necessary as a matter of law.    (The considerations which led theGovernment of the day to introduce a temporary Bill when South Africaleft the Commonwealth do not apply. )   On the other hand this issue is certain to be raised during the debate on our proposed Bangladesh Bill.In our view the best course would be a statement then that Pakistanis willremain Commonwealth citizens until our law is amended, and thatcomprehensive legislation will be introduced in due course.6. We accordingly -(a) seek authority for the preparation of a Bill to beintroduced into Parliament during the present sessionproviding for the recognition of Bangladesh as a memberof the Commonwealth;(b) propose that a statement on the status of Pakistanis bemade in Parliament;   and(c) propose that officials should report on the legislative and other measures necessary to take account ofPakistan1 s withdrawal from the Commonwealth.R MA D-HHome Office12 June 19722
