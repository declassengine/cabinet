FRAMEWORK FOR GOVERNMENT research and DEVELOPMENTI.  introduction. In November 1971 the Government published a Green Paper &quot; a framework for Government Research and Development&quot; (Cmnd. 4814).This included reports by Lord Rothschild, head of the Central policy review Staff, and by a working group of the Council for Scientific Policyunder the chairmanship of Sir Frederick Dainton. At that time theGovernment endorsed three points. First, that applied research anddevelopment commissioned by the Government should be organised inaccordance with a &quot; customer/contractor &quot; principle. Second, that subjectto this principle, the Research Councils should be preserved under thesponsorship of the Department of Education and Science. Third, that a body of authoritative advice should continue to be available to the Secretaryof State for Education and Science on the allocation of her Department^science budget. The Government invited comments before reaching decisions on the detailed application of the customer/contractor principle.2. Many organisations and individuals have put forward comments.There was a debate in the House of Lords in February 1972. Reports fromthe Select Committee on Science and Technology (Session 1971-72) havebeen published. The Government has had a series of discussions withrepresentatives of all the major interests. More than 400 written contributions have been received, and the Press, radio and television have shown a wideinterest.3. The Government has now reached conclusions on a number of themain issues raised. It has been greatly helped by the wide rangingconsultations that have taken place and is grateful to the organisations and individuals who participated.II.  THE MANAGEMENT OF APPLIED RESEARCH ANDDEVELOPMENT IN government. Research and development are essential to the achievement of manyof the Governmenfs objectives. Some of these relate to the Governmenfsown direct responsibilities such as defence. Others bear on a wide range of activities industrial, agricultural, environmental and social for which the government&apos;s responsibility is less direct in that it sets broad objectives inthe interests of the country generally. Objectives are set by the Cabinet,and Ministers are responsible through Parliament to the community as a wholefor seeing that they are attained and for ensuring that value for money is secured for public expenditure.5. Ministers must ensure that departmental objectives are properlybacked by applied research and development programmes, that is to sayprogrammes directly related to these objectives. This country is fortunate in having a strong scientific and technical base.   To make the best use of it3132233 x a confidential
means that those responsible for departmental objectives should also beresponsible for defining their requirements in the clearest possible terms andcommissioning the research and development work needed to achieve them.To do so the departmental &quot; customers&quot; must work in partnership withtheir research and development &quot; contractors &quot;, whether inside or outsidethe Department. Responsibilities are then clear. Departments, as customers,define their requirements; contractors advise on the feasibility of meetingthem and undertake the work; and the arrangements between them must be such as to ensure that the objectives remain attainable within reasonablecost. This is the customer/contractor approach. The Government reaffirmsits intention, announced in the Green Paper, of extending it to all its applied research and development.6. The customer/contractor relationship is already reflected in the planning and execution of major areas of Government research anddevelopment. Later sections of this White Paper outline the organisation in deparments for its application and extension.7. An essential feature of this approach is provision for continuingdiscussion and partnership between customers and contractors and withother interested sections of the community. These are to be extended and developed.8. In practice many of the ideas for research and development to meetthe customer^ needs come from the scientific staff in the contractorsorganisation. But each Department must also have its own central scientificstaff, who are responsible for advice on scientific aspects of departmentalpolicy. They will participate fully in the discussions and ensure that the customer is able to take all ideas into account in stating his needs.9. The Government accepts that contractors will in many cases bebetter able to contribute effectively to these exchanges if they have somefreedom to undertake work which, while being financed by the customers,is not immediately related to a specific programme of work. Lord Rothschildproposed that this need should be met by a general research surcharge. Hesuggested an average, in money terms, of 10 per cent of a customer^programmes. The Government accepts the proposal in principle, but the degree to which this provision is needed will vary; for example in somecases it is already the practice to include an element for private research and development costs in the prices charged to Government. departments will make appropriate arrangements in agreement with the Treasury.10. Decisions about the research and development required to supportnational economic and social policies must rest with Ministers who have responsibility for those policies. The Government&apos;s view, as stated in theWhite Paper on &quot; The Reorganisation of Central Government &quot; (Cmnd. 4506),is that Government Departments should be organised by reference to thetask to be done and the objectives to be met. Applied research anddevelopment is necessary to achieve many of the Governmenfs objectives,but it cannot be regarded as forming a distinct function of government.Any attempt to formulate overall objectives for a supposedly collective activity of research and development would lead to confusion. The Government doesnot therefore accept the recommendation of the Select Committee on Science
and Technology in their First Report for the Session 1971-72 that thereshould be a Minister for Research and Development with his own Vote.But the Government fully recognises that adequate machinery must exist for ensuring co-operation and co-ordination between Departments. The lord privy Seal exercises this function at Ministerial level. The Chief scientific adviser to the Government has responsibility for interdepartmentalco-ordination. He advises Ministers on the scientific and technological aspectsof the Government^ policies, both domestic and international. He will alsobe responsible, in future, for advising on the way in which the new arrangements for the management of applied research and development are working.11. The Government agrees with the Select Committee that at presentneither Parliament nor the public is given sufficient information aboutdepartmental research and development programmes. The Chief scientific adviser has been asked to consider with Departments ways by which more information can be made available.III.  THE ORGANISATION OF RESEARCH AND development in GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS12. Some organisational changes will be needed to bring about the new approach. This section outlines the position in those Departments whichhave already adopted new management approaches and the changes which other Departments are now making.Ministry of Defence13. Provision for research and development in the 1972-73 defence estimates amounted to  330 million, of which  100 million related tointra-mural and  230 million to extra-mural work. The organisationalarrangements for commissioning, carrying out and monitoring this work arealready in accordance with the customer/contractor principle. The Ministry&apos;sChief Scientific Adviser co-ordinates from a scientific point of view theneeds of the Department as a customer for research and development; the procurement Executive (set up in 1971 following the implementation of therecommendations in the White Paper on &quot; Government Organisation for defence Procurement and Civil Aerospace &quot; (Cmnd. 4641)) is the contractorand has to meet the requirements of the three Services for weapons and equipment. Research and development requirements for the ministry are determined by committees on which the central military, scientific and finance staffs, the Service departments and the Procurement Executive are represented. Within the latter, responsibility for the execution of extra-muralprogrammes lies with four Systems Controllers and responsibility for themanagement of the research and development establishments, for theexecution of intra-mural work and for all research rests with the ControllerResearch and Development Establishments and Research. The ProcurementExecutive is also the contractor for requirements placed on it by customersoutside the Ministry of Defence, in particular by the Department of Tradeand Industry. These customers formulate their requirements with theassistance of the Executive and pay the costs of meeting them.
14. The largest of the three main blocks of applied research anddevelopment needed by the Department relates to civil aerospace (costing about  109 million in 1972-73). This is already organised on customer/contractor lines. The Aerospace Group of the Department formulates itsresearch and development objectives in consultation with industry, the procurement Executive, advisory bodies and other organisations; and thencommissions and pays for the work undertaken by its contractor, the procurement Executive, to meet these objectives.15. The second main block is reactor and other nuclear research anddevelopment carried out by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority(UKAEA), costing about  35 million and  8 million respectively in 1972-73.The Department is considering how the nuclear industry and the electricity generating boards might be more closely involved in the decision-making and financial responsibility for nuclear reactor research and development.It is also discussing with the UKAEA the extent to which the customer/contractor principle can be adopted for their applied nuclear programmes.16. The third main block of research and development (costing about 26 million in 1972-73) includes the work of the Departments industrial research Establishments, the non-nuclear work carried out by the UKAEA,extra-mural contracts which the Department places directly with industryand universities and the funds provided to the Industrial research associations. In future responsibility for commissioning much of this work will be channelled through a series of Requirements Boards, on whichcustomer interests in the Department, in industry and elsewhere will berepresented and, where appropriate, the contractors. The new Boardswill cover a number of fields such as standards and metrology; ship and marine technology; mechanical engineering and machine tools; and chemical and mineral processes and plant.17. Under the Chief Scientist of the Department the headquartersorganisation for the research and development covered by the RequirementsBoards will be reorganised into two divisions; a research and developmentrequirements division to serve the customers&apos; interests, and a research anddevelopment contractors&apos; division to represent the interests of the contractors.Department of the Environment18. Soon after the Department of the Environment was formed in theautumn of 1970 it set up a unified research organisation based on the customer /contractor approach to provide co-ordinated research supportthroughout the Department. This organisation is headed by the Director-General (Research). Under him the Director of Research Requirementsassists policy directorates to identify areas for which research is required, tostate research requirements clearly to the Directors of the Departmentsresearch establishments and other contractors and to formulate researchprogrammes and projects. The Director-General (Research) is also theChairman of the Research Contractors&apos; Board which manages the executionof the Departments research programmes.19. These research programmes (estimated at  17 million in 1972-73)are initially discussed and agreed at Research Requirements Committees.Each covers a particular area, is chaired by the appropriate customer within6 &apos;
the Department, and includes representatives of the policy and executivesides of the Department as well as of the Directorate of ResearchRequirements and of research contractors. Their aim is to ensure thatthe Departments research and development needs are formulated in a clear and practical way. These Committees report to three Programme ReviewCommittees covering the main policy areas with which the department is concerned (i.e. planning and transportation, building and construction,and environmental pollution and resources). These three Committees, eachof which is chaired by the Director-General (Research), examine and make recommendations on the scale and balance of the research programmes intheir areas.Department of Health and Social Security20. The Departments 1972-73 research and development programme in health and personal social services amounts to  13 million of which 3-7 million is for capital and  9-3 million for current expenditure. Allbut  0-7 million of the latter is for extra-mural work.21. A Chief Scientist is to be appointed. He will be helped by a smallteam of scientists who will work part-time in the Department. They willhave widely varying experience in the medical and social sciences which are relevant to the Departments needs in health and personal social services.Their main task will be to help identify areas for which research isrequired, to ensure that research requirements are stated clearly, and to review the balance of the Departments research and development programme. In addition they will act as a link between the department and the scientific community so as to develop discussions and partnership between the two.22. There is a long tradition of working with the Medical research council and increasingly close co-operation with the more recently foundedSocial Science Research Council. These links will be developed and full use will be made of both Research Councils as departmental contractors.In the past the advice of independent scientists has been sought on objectives and priorities for research and development, and the appointment of a ChiefScientists, and the strengthening of the Departments scientific skills, willenable these arrangements to be strengthened,Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and Department of Agricultureand Fisheries for Scotland23. The major part of Government-funded agricultural and foodresearch and development (excluding fisheries) is carried out in England andWales by the Agricultural Research Council, whose estimated expenditurein 1972-73 is  21 million. In addition the Ministry has its own laboratoriesand experimental centres and makes grants for applied research anddevelopment to outside organisations, in particular to four food research associations. The Ministry&apos;s expenditure on agriculture and food research and development will be about  5 million in 1972-73. In Scotland,agricultural research and development is undertaken by eight researchinstitutes and three agricultural colleges which are financed by grant fromthe Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland, estimated at 6 million in 1972-73.
24. A Chief Scientist is to be appointed in the Ministry supported by two deputies and a small group of other scientists. He will have two majorroles. First he will contribute scientific advice to the Ministry on the broadrange of policy matters with which it deals. Second he will have a centralrole in framing and reviewing the Ministry&apos;s research and development programmes and in determining the overall order of priorities. Under his chairmanship there will be a Requirements Board whose membership will include the Secretary of the Agricultural Research Council and theDirector-General of the Ministry&apos;s Agricultural Development and advisory service.25. The Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland will work closely with the Ministry&apos;s Chief Scientist organisation to ensure effective co-ordination of the Governments agricultural research and development programmes, and will look to the newly formed Scottish agricultural development Council for co-ordination of development work withinScotland.26. The two Departments are now discussing with the agricultural research Council the establishment of joint consultative machinery to assist them with the consideration of research and development projects,programmes and priorities. It will include scientists, economists, and representatives from the food and agricultural industries and from the policy,scientific and technical sections of the two Departments.27. New arrangements have already been announced for fisheriesresearch and development on which the two Departments are estimated to spend  3-5 million in 1972-73. These arrangements include setting up aFisheries Research and Development Board and are based on the customer/contractor principle.Other Departments28. The organisation of other Departments (including the Home Office,the Department of Employment, the Overseas Development Administrationof the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and the Scottish and welsh offices) is being reviewed. Modifications are being introduced, as necessary,to ensure that they are able to fulfil their functions in accordance with the customer/contractor principle, and in keeping with the relatively modest scale of their research and development programmes and the variety of subjects covered.IV.  THE ROLE OF SCIENTISTS IN GOVERNMENTMANAGEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION29. The changes in organisation outlined in the previous section willenable scientists both inside and outside Government to play a larger role in working out departmental needs and in policy formulation. But morethan this is needed.30. The great majority of qualified scientists who enter government service do so because they want a scientific career. In consequence most ofthem are engaged on research and development in Government establishments.As their careers progress, scientists (and indeed the other professions) become8 /
more deeply involved in management and administration because, in runningresearch groups or administering development projects, they are concernedwith decisions on priorities and the allocation of resources, and participating in policy decisions. For these purposes they must add managerial andadministrative skills to the primary requirement of scientific ability. But inaddition the Government believes more people with scientific or otherprofessional qualifications must be encouraged and given opportunities tomove into posts which are primarily concerned with general policy or manage-ment. To do this a new programme of training and career development is already going forward.31. There have been three main obstacles to moving scientists intomanagement and administration. First, the belief that they do not want to doit; second, uncertainty about their ability to become effective managers oradministrators; and third, uncertainty on the part of the scientists themselves that management really wants them to move into management and administration.32. The first view has often been encountered not least among scientists.But attitudes change and a recently completed study showed that a high proportion of young scientific Civil Servants were interested in moving intomanagement or administration in their early 30s.33. It is more difficult to produce facts on the second viewpoint. Butthe success of those scientists who have in the past transferred to the oldAdministrative Class suggests that the transition to management and administration can be made successfully.34. The third obstacle is the key to the problem. Until comparativelyrecently the young scientist had to take the initiative by applying for a transfer and in so doing often had to leave behind a successful career in science forthe uncertainties of administration. Management provided the opportunitybut did not do enough to encourage such moves. Furthermore, seniorscientists were not unnaturally reluctant to see some of their best men movinginto management and administration.35. Again attitudes have changed in recent years. Young scientists arenow encouraged to make such moves and can be confident that their previous experience will be regarded as a positive advantage in management and administration. For their part scientists need to acquire further skills in management and administration.36. To help this process the Civil Service College started courses last year in management training for scientific officers and other young graduatespecialists early in their careers. These are intended to provide a broaderbackground together with the initial skills needed to manage small researchgroups. Those who show a marked aptitude for management or administration will be selected, starting this year, for further special training at the College. It is then intended that, following this course and while ata still relatively young age, they should spend two years at headquarters.This will further broaden their experience; test their interest in, and potentialfor management and administration; and better fit them for whatever poststhey fill later in their careers. At this stage some may wish to transfer to the9      &apos;
Administration Group and make their career in general management and administration, but most will probably want to return to scientific work. Infuture, Directors and Deputy Directors of establishments will usually havehad some previous experience at headquarters.37. This programme of training and career development should equipscientists and other specialists to compete for those posts at Under-Secretarylevel and above where there is a particular need for able administrators witha specialist background. Equally, they will be better able to fill posts atlower levels which are open to all suitable individuals, irrespective of theirbackground.38. So far as the Administration Group is concerned, the number of recruits with qualifications in science, mathematics or engineering has been rather low. There is however an encouraging increase in the number ofAdministration Trainees with degrees in science, mathematics or engineering:in both 1970 and 1971 12 per cent of the successful external candidates had such degrees. To some extent the movement of scientists into administration has become concealed by the increasing use of posts which are open to all.Nevertheless, the Government agrees that the Administration Group wouldbe strengthened if it included more people with a scientific or other specialistbackground. To help achieve this a special competition is now being held for transfer to the Administration Group at Principal level.39. Mobility within the Civil Service is not the only problem. TheGovernment believes that it would be in the public interest if there were agreater interchange of scientific talent between the Civil Service on the onehand and the Research Councils, universities and industry on the other. Thiswould benefit all those concerned, including the scientists themselves. Someinterchange already occurs, mainly with Research Councils, but theGovernment believes it should be increased significantly and extended to theother areas. This can only be done with the co-operation of the other employers involved. The Government intends, therefore, to set up a smallhigh-level task force drawn from the Civil Service, Research Councils,universities and industry charged with studying the problems involved andwith working out and overseeing a scheme to develop such interchanges.40. Most scientists working in Government will continue, and will wishto continue, to make their main contribution through laboratory and establishment-based research and development programmes. But the actionalready in hand, and now to be taken, will increase the opportunities forscientists (and other specialists) to move into management and to play an effective and important part in policy-making.41. A very important feature of this policy is to attract some of the bestyoung specialists for training and experience in management and administration. If standards are lowered the whole scheme would bediscredited. By concentrating on the most able, there is a good prospect that the great majority of candidates will make the transition successfully.10CONFIDENTIAL
42. As well as financing applied research and development to meetdepartmental objectives, the Government also supports scientific researchthrough the five Research Councils and the University Grants Committee.The purpose of this research is to develop the sciences as such, to maintain a fundamental capacity for research, and to support higher education.43. This research is sponsored by the Secretary of State for education and Science and the funds for the Research Councils are provided throughthe science budget of the Department for Education and Science. Much ofthis research is in subjects for which Government Departments do not havethe necessary facilities. The report of Sir Frederick Dainton&apos;s working group drew attention to the advantages of the Research Council system.The Government has already said that it proposes to retain the system of research Councils responsible to the Secretary of State for Education and science. The Government also accepts that, in future, Departments shouldbe more closely associated in framing the Councils&apos; programmes. Inaddition, Departments are to be provided with funds to commission applied research in some areas covered by the Research Councils.44. Three consequences follow. First, the Council for Scientific policy will need to be reconstituted; second, Departments will be directlyrepresented on the Research Councils; third, some of the funds at present provided from the science budget of the Department of Education and science will be transferred to customer Departments and brought withinthe scope of the customer/contractor principle.The re-constituted Council for Scientific Policy45. The Government recognises the valuable work that has been doneby the many eminent scientists who have served on the Council for scientific policy. It does not intend to interpose any executive statutory bodybetween the Secretary of State for Education and Science and the research councils. However, to advise in future on the allocation of the science budget of the Department of Education and Science between the research councils and other bodies and on the structure of the Research Councilsystem the Secretary of State will, in the autumn, replace the existingCouncil for Scientific Policy with a new advisory body. Its membershipwill include the Chairman or Secretary of each of the five Research Councils,the Chairman of the University Grants Committee, senior scientists fromDepartments with a major interest in the work of the Research Councils, arepresentative of the Chief Scientific Adviser to the Government, and independent members drawn from the universities, industry and the royal society of London. One of the independent members will be appointed asthe part-time Chairman.Membership of Research Councils46. Under the Royal Charters the Secretary of State for Education and science, in consultation as necessary with the President of the Royal Society,appoints the Chairman and (except for the Agricultural Research Council)all the members of each Council. In future the Secretary of State will agree11
these appointments with those Ministerial colleagues principally concerned;the appointment of certain members of the Agricultural Research council by the agricultural Ministers will continue.47. Government Departments with a substantial interest in the workof a Research Council will provide full members and not, as is usual atpresent, assessors. The Government will discuss with the Councils any necessary amendments to their Charters.Future financing of Research Councils48. In future, part of the funds provided by the Government for three off the Research Councils, the Agricultural Research Council (ARC), theMedical Research Council (MRC) and Natural Environment research council (NERC) will become the responsibility of customer Departments tohelp meet their needs for commissioned research. During the next threeyears funds rising from  10 million in 1973-74 to  15 million in 1974-75and to a final total of  20 million in 1975-76 plus the specific sums referredto in paragraphs 55 and 56 will be transferred from the science budget ofthe Department of Education and Science to the Votes of customerDepartments. For ease of comparison with the figures used in LordRothschild&apos;s report, on which the public debate has been conducted, all thefigures are in terms of constant 1971-72 prices. The actual sums whichwill be transferred in the three years will be increased in proportion to the planned growth in the science budget.49. The reconstituted Council for Scientific Policy will advise theSecretary of State for Education and Science on the allocation of the science budget of her Department. The Council will know and be able to take into account the size and nature of the work to be commissioned bycustomer Departments. Its recommendations will then be considered by theGovernment in planning future totals of public expenditure on research anddevelopment. It will be part of the Governmenfs job to keep under review the effect of the new system on the Councils and, indirectly, on the universities. When the transfers set out below have been completed in1975-76 Ministers intend that there should be a period of stability before any further review is made.50.  The details are as follows:  million at 1971-72 prices total previously fiananced Amounts to be transferred from science budget of from science budget toDepartment of Education Votes of customer	and Science		Departments		1971-72	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76ARC   ...	18-7	5-0	7-50	10-0MRC   ...	22-4	2-75	4-25	5-50NERC ...	15-3	2-25	3-25	4-50	56-4	10-0	15-0	20-0Of the  20 million total transfer,  10-5 million will go to the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food,  5 million to the Department of Health12
and Social Security (to be shared with the Scottish Home and HealthDepartment),  2-5 million to the Department of Trade and Industry, 1-5 million to the Department of the Environment and  0-5 million to theDepartment of Employment. Proportional sums will go to these Depart-ments in the years 1973-74 and 1974-75. The Government will be puttingfurther details on the allocation of funds between customer Departments tothe Councils concerned.51. No conditions will be placed on the use of the money transferredto customer Departments, but the expectation is that it will be spent to commission applied research work from the Research Councils. Nor willany transfers be made until the customer Departments have establishedtheir central scientific staffs.52. Customer Departments will become accountable for the sumstransferred to their Votes and it will be for their Accounting Officers tojustify the sums paid to the Councils as contractors and to be satisfied aboutthe programmes of work that make up the total payment. Unlike thearrangements for funding the science budget of the Department of education and Science the money paid by customer Departments will not take the formof grants-in-aid, since these would be inappropriate for expenditure oncommissioned projects. Expenditure on new capital facilities will be met by customer Departments to the extent that the facilities are related to their requirements.53. It will be necessary for the Research Councils and customerDepartments to work out jointly arrangements to cover both the terms underwhich Departments will commission work and the responsibilities of the council&apos;s in undertaking the work. Final responsibility for defining the objectives of commissioned research must rest with the department concerned, although the Councils will be entitled to refuse work if they havegood grounds; for example, if the project were not scientifically feasible or if adequate resources were not available. Once accepted, it will be for a council to decide on the detailed management of commissioned research,but Departments will need to be satisfied before committing funds that a project has been effectively planned and that arrangements exist forsystematic surveillance and review. A Council may normally expectfreedom to publish and communicate information about commissioned work,although there may be circumstances (involving, for example, national or commercial security) when customer Departments must reserve their position on publication.54. The Government believes that partnership and co-operationbetween Departments and the Research Councils is an essential feature ofthis approach and that the new arrangements must be designed to ensurethat these aims are met. The Government attaches great importance to thesupport which all the Research Councils give to the universities and the new arrangements are designed to ensure that this should continue unimpeded.The Nature Conservancy, the Soil Survey of England and Wales and the institute of Hydrology55. The Nature Conservancy is at present part of the Natural Environ-ment Research Council, with a special status under Article 7 of the CounciFsCharter.  More than half of its effort goes directly into the management of13
national nature reserves and advisory, educational and protective work onwild life conservation. These activities connect with other measures tocontrol and protect the countryside. They would be more appropriatelyfunded through an environmental programme budget than a research council budget. But the rest of the Conservancy&apos;s effort goes into research.Part is directly applied to the solution of conservation problems. A major part, however, contributes to the general programme of the NaturalEnvironment Research Council which would be unable without it to fulfilits charter responsibilities for ecological research. There is therefore aduality in the Nature Conservancy in its present form, which has causedstresses difficult to resolve within the present framework. The government believes that if the original purposes of setting up a Nature Conservancy in1949 and of setting up a Research Council for the environmental sciences in1965 are both to be fulfilled, it is necessary to make a fresh start.Accordingly, the funds for managing the nature reserves (about  1-1 million on the 1971-72 figures) and for commissioning applied research connectedwith this (about  0-3 million) will be transferred from the science budget ofthe Department of Education and Science to the Department of the environment from the beginning of 1973-74. Following the necessary legislation, the Nature Conservancy committee of the Natural EnvironmentResearch Council will be abolished and a new Nature Conservancy Councilestablished by the Secretary of State for the Environment, to be appointed in consultation with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales. Thenature reserves and the staff to run them will become the responsibility ofthe new Nature Conservancy Council. The balance of the funds for theNature Conservancy (about  0-7 million) will remain with the NaturalEnvironment Research Council, together with laboratories and relevant staff.Machinery will be established to enable the new Nature ConservancyCouncil and the Natural Environment Research Council to co-operate fullyon matters of joint interest and concern, including the use of each other&apos;sfacilities. Discussions with all the parties concerned, including the staff associations, will take place as soon as possible, so that effective workingrelationships can be established, particularly for the interim period beforethe new arrangements can be brought fully into operation.56. The Soil Survey of England and Wales will continue to be research Council responsibility, but the present funds for its financing( 0-25 million on the 1971-72 figures) will be transferred to the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food from the Department of Education and science science budget as from 1973-74.57. There will be no change in the status of the Institute of Hydrologywithin the Natural Environment Research Council, though some applied research may in future be funded by customer Departments. When final decisions have been taken on future arrangements for the management ofthe country&apos;s water resources, it will also be necessary to work out a comprehensive research programme, taking account of the whole capabilityin this area of which the Institute is an important part.The Science and Social Science Research Councils58. These two Councils are in a different position from the other three.The Social Science Research Council is a young organisation with a small14
budget ( 4-1 million in 1971-72), about half of which is devoted to thesupport of post-graduate students in institutions of higher education. Nochange is proposed in the present arrangements for financing the work ofthe Social Science Research Council. Some Departments may, in future,want to place commissioned research with the Council; this will be new and additional work.59. The Science Research Council is a large body which absorbs much the biggest share ( 55-7 million in 1971-72) of the science budget of theDepartment of Education and Science, and, apart from contributions to international scientific organisations such as the European organisation for Nuclear Research and the European Space Research Organisation, itsprimary purpose is to sustain standards of education and research in the universities. Its funds are, therefore, largely spent on university researchgrants and on the maintenance of large-scale equipment and facilities forthe use of university researchers and on post-graduate student support.No changes are to be made in the funding arrangements for the science research Council, but a study is being made of possible overlaps betweenthe research which it finances and other research work commissioned bythe Department of Trade and Industry or the Department of the Environment.The Royal Societies60. At present, the grants-in-aid to the Royal Society of London andthe Royal Society of Edinburgh are paid by the Department of education and Science. In future, to meet the wishes of the two Royal Societies,the grant to the Royal Society of London will continue to be paid by theDepartment of Education and Science, but the Royal Society of Edinburghwill receive its grant-in-aid from the Scottish Office.VI.  THE WAY AHEAD61. The decisions announced in this White Paper deal with the new arrangements for commissioning Government applied research anddevelopment, with the future role of the Research Councils, and with theuse of scientific manpower in the Civil Service. The Government believes that the clearer definition of the responsibilities of the two parties involvedin applied research and development, and the more precise designation ofthe future role of the Research Councils, will help to define the scientificproblems underlying national needs, will provide a way to determine whatresearch and development programmes are worthwhile, how much shouldbe spent on them, and how the results can be fully exploited to the benefitof the community as a whole. The essence of this approach is theneed for better discussions and partnership between all involved in thesecomplex and difficult processes whether in Government or outside it. Thenew framework provides a partnership within which science will have more influence on the Governments central-policy making activities than before and will contribute more directly and more effectively to the task of making the best use of science and technology for the needs of thecommunity as a whole.Printed in England by Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office3133233  Dd.
