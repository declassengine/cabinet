REORGANISATION OF THE NUCLEAR. INDUSTRYReport by an Inter-Departmental &amp;rou  of.,0ffioiaIsAt the meeting of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy on1 May 1972, officials were asked to oonsider the implication6 of theproposals in ES(72) 20 for the reorganisation of the nuclear industry,particularly as regards the future of the Atomic Energy Authority (sea),and to provide Ministers with an assessment of the various alternativesopen to the G-overnment.2.     The annexed memorandum examines the principal options open to theGovernment.   It concludes that reorganisation is urgently needed to remedy the weaknesses of the present nuclear industry, and that such a reorganisa-tion must involve the replacement of the two existing design and construction consortia &quot;by a single company and a reallocation ofresponsibility between the sea (who carry out research and development anreactors) and industry (which exploits the results of that research).Reorganisation must be designed to strengthen the commercial and managerialeffectiveness of the industry, while safeguarding the Government&apos;s controlover major strategic decisions and over the public money which will stillneed to be committed to nuclear research and development.   It must facili-tate the establishment of strong international links; and it must not undulyrestrict the choice of reactor systems for development.
3.     Provided that further eonsultation confirms that these conditionscan he satisfactorily met, a solution involving a company already in thefield seems the most likely to achieve the objective, and of these theGeneral Electric Company (G.C) is the one most able at present to bring in the necessary resources and managerial ability,,   A solution based on anew company in which G.C would have a majority shareholding should thereforebe given priority in further discussions on the subject.   :.Vhile acceptance by the Government of the case for a single company would itself pointstrongly towards the likelihood of a G.C solution, the Government&apos;s bargaining power should not be thrown away by premature sommitment to this solutionirrespective of the conditions demanded by G.C.   Any approach to other european countries at Governmental level with a view to establishing theEuropean links for the reorganised British industry should be deferred untildecisions have been taken *n the general form of the reorganisation and onthe European proposals for which we are trying to enlist support.   Thisshould be possible after the discussions proposed in paragraph ?a below.4.     The present situation under which those responsible for design and construction (the consortia) have no effective say in the development programmes (carried out by the sea) on which their designs depend, isbasically unsatisfactory.   An effective prirate sector solution would there-fore require some redravdng of the frontier between the responsibilities ofpublic and private enterprise.   In the first instance, this need not takethe form of an actual transfer of facilities, although a small number ofstaff might need to be moved from the sea to the company.   There should how-ever be a new relationship between the iompany, the sea and the Government,under which the company, in consultation with the sea and British NuclearEuels Ltd, would be able to initiate proposals on the development programmes for nuclear reactors and nuclear fuels.2
5.     Improved arrangements are also required for co-ordination between allthe bodies concerned with the development and exploitation of nuclear power,and to provide concerted advice to the Secretary of State for Trade andIndustry on those major issues which will still need to be kept under government control.   We recommend that this should be achieved through thecreation of a Nuclear Power Board on the lines suggested in paragraphs 17 to20 of the attached memorandum.   If this recommendation is approved inprinciple, further detailed consideration should be given to the Board&apos;sconstitution and functions, in consultation with the various interested bodies.6.     None of these proposals would require legislation.7. Ministers are recommended to endorse the general conclusions summarised above and to approve the following proposals for immediate action:-a.     A reconnaissance in some depth should be carried out as quickly as possible with G.C to explore the basis of a reorganisation underwhich they would have a majority shareholding in a new nuclearcompany.   In su*h discussions the Governmenfs broad attitude should bemade clear, as in paragraphs 2, 4- and 5 above, but without explicitcommitment to a G.C solution until satisfactory terms had been negotiated and approved by Ministers.   The aim should be to completethese preliminary discussions and report /to Ministers before the summer Recess if possible.   The subsequent implementation of there organisation would &quot;require further complex negotiations which wouldtake some time.3
b.     Further consideration should be given urgently, in con-suit at ion with the various interested bodies, to the consti-tution and functions of the Nuclear Power Board proposed inparagraph 5 above.8. Given the complexity *f the issues, the concern felt by the companies and staff abouii tho outcome, and the international implications, the timing and substance of a public announcement will need very oareful consideration.4
ANNEXREORGaNISATIok of the NUCLEAR, industry.     The Group were asked to consider the implications of the proposals in ES(72) 20 for the reorganisation of the nucbar industry in this country,particularly as regards the future of the Atomic Energy Authority (sea), andto provide Ministers as soon as possible with an assessment of the various alternatives open to the Government.the present situation.     A summary of the present structure of the British nuclear industry isattached at Appendix A.   There is very widespread agreement about the weakness of the industry and the urgent need to strengthen it.3.     This weakness arises partly from the lack of a competitive product.Thermal reactors developed in the United Kingdom have so far failed to compete effectively, in sales terms, with those developed in the United Stateand elsewhere.   The fast breeder reactor (fbr) has better prospects, but the nuclear industry in its present form could not survive until this is ready for commercial exploitation.4.     But there are also major structural weaknesses.   In the first place,the United Kingdom market is not big enough to support 2 separate design and construction consortia.   The most it could support is a single industrial organisation, whith would need strong international links.   The central electricity Generating Board (CEGB) used to consider that 2 consortia were necessary to maintain competition.   They have now however abandoned this view and accepted the case for a single organisation which has been pressed by theAEA, the Select Committee on Science and Technology, and others for manyyears.   Whatever other arrangements are made, the case for this change seemsconclusive.
5.     Secondly, there are weaknesses in the present consortium approach.Our most important competitors - Ties tin gho use Corporation and theUnited States (US) General Electric - are in a position to offer a fullyintegrated package consisting of a nuclear reactor and its initial fuelcharge and, if desired, the rsst of the power station as well.   Both thesefirms control their own research and development (although this benefits from the very substantial sums expended by the US Atomic Energy Commission).They are thus responsible (both for the fuel and the reactor) for thecomplete process of development, design, construction and assembly.   by comparison, the United Kingdom consortia tend to be creatures of the parti-cipants rather than independent entities.   The profits from individualsections of the contract, e.g. for turbines or civil engineering, go not tothe consortium but to the firm responsible for carrying out that part *fthe contract, and those who stand to make the greatest profits do not carry the greatest risks.   The participant firms use their shareholding in the consortium mainly to get the part *f the job which interests them, and thisprecludes &quot;shopping around&quot; for equipment available from competing suppliers.If we are to begin to face up to international competition, the industrial organisation in this country must take the form of a company with theresources, technical skills and managerial ability to proviie a comparablelevel *f service, rather than a lc-ose consortium on the present pattern.6.     Thirdly, the existing organisation, split between the sea, the consortia,the generating boards and the Government, appears to divide responsibilitiesat the wrong points and not provide the right incentive for efficiency andcompetitiveness.   In particular, it is widely recognised, both in theindustry and in the sea, that it is unsatisfactory that the industry areexpected to design nuclear reactors without playing any significant part inthe formulation ar determination of the development programmes on which thesedesigns depend.6
7-     Linked with this is the problem af ensuring that the development ofnew reactor types takes sufficient account of the consumer interest ofthe generating boards, as well as the wider national interest reflected inoverall Government energy policy.   The need for continued Government supportof nuclear research and development (R &amp; D) in this country appearsinescapable, particularly so long as it is heavily subsidised from public funds in other countries.   It is essential to avoid a situation where lai-gesums of public money are spent an the development af reactor systems which do not eventually meet the requirements of aur own electricity supply industry.   There is therefore a need both to associate the Government andthe generating boards more olasely with the initial ohoice of reactor typesfor development and vdth the subsequent development process; and to ensurethat the development of new types and the purchase of nuolear reactors forthe eleatricity supply industry aonform with an overall energy supplystrategy, for which in the last resort the Government must remain responsible.POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS8. In the light of this analysis there appear to be two basic aptions whichmight be contemplated for the new industrial tompany:-i.     To build on an existing public body - which might be either the sea or British Nuolear Fuels Ltd (which was recently hivedaff from the sea with provision for introducing a minorityprivate shareholding, although far the present the sea stillhald all the shares);7
ii.     To build on a private company which already has adequateresources, technical skills and managerial ability.   The onlyexisting company which appears to be able at present to bring this combination of attributes to the task is the General ElectricCompany (G.C).   If this option is followed, decisions will also berequired about the future relationship between the private andpublic sector.A Public Enterprise Solution9.     Two proposals already exist under this heading.   The Select Committeeon Science and Technology suggested in 19^7 that the exploitation of nuclear power should be carried out by the sea, either directly or through a subsidiary.   This is broadly speaking the arrangement which has beenadopted in Canada.   The other variant, which is at present being pursued bythe Chairman of the ASA, Sir John Hill, is that the lead should be taken byBritish Nuolear Fuels Ltd (BNFL).   Under his proposal, BNFL would be themain shareholder in a new company, with minority shareholdings held by theboilermakers, Clarke Ghapman and Babcock &amp; YiJilcox.    (The boilermakers them-selves, however, while having doubts of their om about such an enterprise,would hope to share a majority holding if this course was preferred.)   Sucha company would not have the commercial strength of a firm like G.C, althoughit might be strengthened in this respect if it could unite with KraftwerkeUnion (KWU), the leading German firm in this field.   In favour of this optionit can be argued that it would provide for a: fully integrated process ofdevelopment and subsequent exploitation, covering both the nuclear reactorsand thoir fuel.   However, the present arrangement under which fuel isprovided by BNFL seems to work satisfactorily at present and there is nopressing need to change it.   Any public enterprise solution would .8
mean reversing the trend of recent years by &quot;hiving back&quot; into the sea,and as the main object of any reorganisation must be to bring in a high degree of commercial and managerial competence, the G-roup consider thatpriority should be given to exploring solutions based primarily on theprivate sector; although if it proved impossible to achieve a satisfactoryprivate sector solution, it might be necessary to revert to the idea of apublic enterprise body.A private company10.   As noted in paragraph 8(ii) above, G.C appears the only one of theexisting private oompanies to be able at present to bring in the necessaryresources and managerial leadership.   G-EC is already involved in the nuclearindustry through its managing role in the British Nuclear Design and construction (BNDC) consortium, and through its own reactor equipmentsubsidiary.   A new company of which G.C was the major shareholder, with appropriate minority shareholdings, would provide an organisation broadlycomparable, though on a smaller scale, to the pattern set by the rival UScompanies.   G.C is already interested in taking a leading role in a newnuclear company, and from exploratory talks with them some points are alreadyclear.   First, they would expect the Government to continue to givesubstantial support to nuclear R &amp; D.   second, they would not necessarilywish to be committed solely to manufacturing and selling British nucleartechnology: they might, for example, want also to manufacture American-designedlight water reactors under licence.   Third, /although some doubts have been expressed whether G.C would find it easy to find nuclear partners in Europe,they themselves consider that they would be able to do so.   Fourth, they would regard some adjustment of the frontier between the company and the sea as an
essential concomitant of a successful private sector solution; and, as aminimum, they would want to be able to formulate the programmes of develop-ment wcrk on reactors and fuel elements at present formulated and carriedout by the sea.11.   The sea now themselves accept in principle that those responsible fordesign and construction should have a greater say in the formulation ofdevelopment programmes.   There is however still room for argument on whereand how the frontier should be dravin.   In particular, it is essential thatany new arrangement should provide a satisfactary working relationship between the G-overnment, the sea, BKEL and the company; should be compatible with good staff morale; and shculd not interfere with ongoing work,particularly the development of the 3?BR.12.   Any major immediate change in the frontier would present considerablepractical problems and would need legislation.   It is true that in the us and Germany a situation has grown up under which the nuclear companiescarry out their own R&amp;D (although the basic research and some of the testfacilities are still provided by the public sector).   But in both thosecountries the firms have been able to build up the necessary R&amp;D facilitiesover the years with the assistance they have received from public funds.   Inthe US, the firms also benefited from the massive public expenditure ondeveloping the pressurised water reactor for defence purposes, which enabledthem subsequently to exploit it for civil use.   But we are starting from a quite different position.   The facilities now owned by the sea represent a major public asset, and G.C, at least in the first instance, would not beprepared to pay to take them over.   Moreover sea staff conditions of service are closely related to those of the civil service^ and some of the staff10
were given specific assurances when they transferred to the sea in 1954.When BNPL was hived off in 1971 it proved impossible to rely on voluntarytransfer, and compulsory transfer had to be provided in 3sgislation.   Sucha procedure would probably be needed again if another substantial transferwas contemplated.13.   To avoid these difficulties, it would be preferable in the firstinstance to avaid any actual transfer af establishments, but to institute a new relationship under which the company would be the prime initiator ofthe development proposals to be considered for Government financial support.This new relationship would require the introduction of new arrangements forca-ordination and advioe, and in paragraphs 17 to 20 below we propose the setting up of a Nuclear Power Board for this purpose.   The company&apos;s locusand role in the actual carrying out of development work would be considerably affected by the extent of their financial participatian amicould therefore change aver time.    So long as the Government have to finance the whole or virtually, the whole af the work, it will be difficultto make any move of substance from the present arrangement under which the funds are voted to the sea and the programmes are administered by them,though it might be possible to place certain specific development contracts with the company, part of which might be sub-contracted back to the sea&apos;sestablishments.   At a later stage, depending on the company&apos;s degree ofcommercial success, and subject to considerations of defence interest, itmight wish to take over outright certain development facilities (e.g. thecomponent test laboratory at Risley or the fuel development laboratoriesat Springfields and wind scale) and possibly, later on, other sea establish-ments aoncerned with reactor development.   Such proposals, which would11
probably require legislation, c*uld be considered on their merits, but no decision is required at this stage.    It wc-uld in any case be appropriate t*retain under public ownership the long-term researoh facilities at Harwelland Culham.   These could, in addition to their main role, provide areserve capability for investigating problems arising in the development and operation of nuclear reactors.14-.   The minority shareholdings in the new company would require furtherconsideration in the light of &amp;EC&apos;s own views on the point.   A number ofmembers of the present consortia might wish to acquire a stake, and their claims would all need to be considered.   It would be for consideration whether there should also be a publicly-owned minority shareholding, as there is in the present consortia.15.   Whatever its minority shareholdings, the new company must be capableof offering - not necessarily wholly from its own resources - a completenuclear power station on a &quot;turnkey&quot; basis when this is required by an export customer.   The interests *f our own generating boards, however, maybest be served by purchasing the nuclear reactor from the company, and remaining free to &quot;shop around&quot; for the other parts of the power station ona normal competitive basis.   This should do much to overcome the conflictsof interest between the company and its shareholders mentioned in paragraph 5above, and in particular to prevent G-EC from gaining an unfair advantage inthe supply of turbo-generators ever its competitor Reyrolle Parsons.BTTEMiVnONAL ASPECTS16.   Any of the options described above would be compatible with ourbilateral agreements with the United States on civil nuclear energy.   Thearrangements must also be designed to facilitate the development of close12
international collaboration in Europe.   Both G.C and the Nuclear PewerGroup consortium (TNPG) are already having discussions with possibleEuropean partners.   G.C are satisfied that they would be able to forgesuitable European links if they were to take the leadership in the Britishnuclear industry; and a public enterprise body should be able to do thesame.   On present information, this factor should not therefore be a seriousconstraint on the choice of national organisation for the United Kingdom,but it is a point that will need to be continually watched in thediscussions.   A European initiative at Government level would not be appropriate until decisions have been taken about the form of the new company and the kind of links that would be helpful to it.   Such decisionsneed therefore to be taken so*n, in *rder that we tan intervene as soon aspossible and ensure that the discussions about possible European nuclearpartnerships are on lines which will give the new British nuclear industry the kind of European links which it needs.IMPROVED ARR^GEl-EETS FOR aEVICB AND COj^RpiNATION17.   There remains the general question how best the responsibilitiesclearly falling to Government could be handled when the nuclear reactorindustry is reorganised into a single nev; company.   The Government will be concerned not only with the financing of R &amp; D, but also with the developmentof an overall energy strategy, including a strategy for the use of nuclear power.   It will be necessary to ensure that Government decisions are basedon full consultation with the industry, the sea, BNFL and the generatingboards, and also, more specifically, that the consumer interest of thegenerating boards is taken into account at all stages of the development ofnew nuclear systems.   The existing machinery for advice and consultationavailable to the Department of Trade and Industry does not seem adequate to solve these related problems.13
18.   This gap could, be filled by the creation of a Kuclear Power board with co-ordinating functions and with the responsibility of providingconcerted advice to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.   Thefunctions of such a Board might include the following:-a. to make recommendations to the Secretary of State on -i.     the underlying nuclear research programme;ii.     the choice of reactor systems to be developed;iii.     specific programmes of development work which are believed to have commercial potential (including prototypesand design studies) and the allocation of this work, e.g.between the new company and the sea:iv.     the allocation of Government funds for R&amp;D;v.     possible ways of developing international collaboration;vi.     the ordering of nuclear power stations.b. to keep progress in all these fields under continuing review.19. The chairman and members of the Board would be appointed by Ministers,and it would contain representatives of the generating boards, the sea, thenew company, BNEL and Government departments.   A Board with these functions14
and with this composition would he designed to make firm recommendationsafter a full exploration of all the various technical, commercial andfinancial considerations, so that its work would not subsequently need tobe duplicated in Whitehall.   It would also be designed, among other things,to give the generating boards, as final customers, an integral role in theworking out of development programmes and choice of reactor systems.   Itsre*recommendations on on such programmes would be made after full study of theproposals put forward by the company.   Although it is an essential feature of the Board that it would bring together all those concerned with nuclear power, and the new company would therefore be represented on it, the factthat the company would be the prime beneficiary of the Board&quot;s financialrecommendations would need to be taken into account in its procedures for making such recommendations.20.   If the general idea of a new Board is approved in principle by ministers, further more detailed work would be necessary on its composition and terms of reference.    So long as the functions of the Board were advisory,it would not require legislation.   Nevertheless, as the company and the sea,and indeed the generating boards, will recognise that the allocation of funds in this field will depend on decisions taken by the Secretary of state on the Board&apos;s recommendation, the Board should be able to develop an effective supervisory role, which we regard as essential.CHOICE OE NUCLEAR REACTOR SYSTEMS21.   The Group were not asked to make recommendations on the choice of nuclear reactor systems, but in examining alternative courses forreorganisation Ministers will need to bear in mind the interaction between15
decisions on organisation and the decisions still to be taken on reactorsystems.   In some respects, the replacement of the 2 consortia by a singlecompany should simplify miters, in the sense that it would be assured ofwork whatever decision was taken on reactor types.   Either G-EC or BNFLwould however probably seek some fairly clear assurances about futureordering intentions before committing themselves to a new organisation.22.   With regard to the FBR, which Ministers have already firmly decidedto support, there does not seem to be a problem, since any of the courseslisted above would be compatible with its continued development.   It would however be essential to ensure a smooth transition so that our advantage inthis field is not lost.23.   With regard to the thermal reactors, a choice of system still has tobe made.   Under a private sector solution, G-EC are known to favour further work on the AGR to produce a trouble-free version, and would no doubt alsobe willing to manufacture light water reactors under license fromWestinghouse, but they have not yet completely declared their hand on theBritish steam generating heavy water reactor (SGKWR).   We know that theyare pessimistic about its chances of success, but they have refrained fromactually saying they would not build it if the generating boards ordered itand Government backed it.   If they were prepared to make it, they couldanyway be expected to take the line that the Government must underwrite allthe risk.   Their attitude on this could only be finally clarified by further talks in the light of broad Ministerial guidance on the issues raised in this paper.16
24-    There may therefore be an awkward problrara of timing.   The idealwould be if decisions on reorganisation and on thermal reactor systemscould be taken virtually in a single package.   But this may not be possiblein practice, since the reorganisation depends on negotiations betweenbodies outside Government, while the choice of thermal reactor is affectedby uncertainties about safety and other matters, which will take time to resolve.   The reorganisation anyway cannot wait for very long because theexisting consortia cannot survive for more than a few months; and if it includes the setting up of a Nuclear Power Board as suggested above, theBoard&apos;s advice could affect the choice of reactor.   The decisions aboutreorganisation might therefore be affected in one of two ways: on the onehand, if a very early decision were taken to back the SGHWR, this might thenlimit the range of options for reorganisation; on the other, if the finaldecision on thermal reactors is deferred, decisions may need to be taken onreorganisation which could effectively constrain the choice of reactor.   Sofar as possible, therefore, the two subjects must be. pursued in parallel,so that the situation on the one is clarified as far as possible by thetime decisions need to be taken on the other.   Ministers will wish to have this background in mind when they resume their discussion of the proposals to defer the choice of reactors while commissioning a design study for theSGHWR and trying to produce a trouble-free AGR.   It will also be necessaryto take stock of the position again when the discussions about reorganisationare nearer a conclusion.LEGISLATION25.   The proposals described above would not require legislation.   Once are organised industry had got under way, legislation might however be needed for a number of matters, e.g. if it were eventually proposed to17
transfer any substantial numbers of staff from the sea to the new company or to confer any statutory supervisory or executive responsibilities onthe proposed Nuclear Power Board, or to give general authority for theprovision of G-overnment development funds direct to the company.PROCEDURE26.   Although exploratory talks have already taken place with G.C andsome of the other firms conterned, a reconnaissance in some depth wouldbe needed with G.C before we could be sure that a solution based on that company would be practicable.   It would be necessary to be able to sayexplicitly that the Government envisaged the replacement of the 2 existingconsortia by a single company, and in practice this would make if fairlyobvious that the Government were looking for a solution involving G.C if satisfactory terns could be arranged.   It would however be wrong to throwaway the Governmenfs bargaining power by premature commitment to thisparticular solution irrespective of the conditions demanded by G.C.   It wouldalso be necessary in the discussion to accept in principle that the company should have a greater say in the formulation of development programmes, andit would be helpful to be able to explore the possibility of new arrangements on the lines suggested in paragraphs 17 to 20 above.   If Ministers approve the initiation of discussions on this basis, the aim should be to completethese preliminary discussions and report to Ministers before the summer recess if possible.   The subsequent implementation of the reorganisationwould require further complex negotiations which would take some time.   Giventhe complexity of the issues, the concern felt by the companies and staffabout the outcome, and the international implications, the timing andsubstance of a public announcement will need very careful consideration.18

SECRETOPINIONS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE NUCLEAR industry the Thermal Reactor Working party&apos;s prime task was to recommend which thermal reactorsystem should be built in the UK during the 70s and their discussions with members ofthe nuclear industry have naturally centred on future reactor policy.   The working party did touch upon the associated question of reorganisation of the industry but thishas been more thoroughly examined by the Department outside the committees formalmeetings.   We have, of course, sounded industry on this issue and the views they haveexpressed are summarised below.a)    British Nuclear Forum (BNF,the nuclear industry&apos;s Trade Association)10 August 1971*2    BNF thought that the real weakness of the British nuclear industry lay in purorganisational framework.   In contrast, the industry in Japan, Germany and the US had3 main commercial strong points:a) Complete nuclear boilers (the essentially nuclear part of the station)were sold by substantial corporations who could afford the customer areasonable warranty.b) R &amp; D was funded through industry.c) Fuel was manufactured and supplied through the corporations sellingnuclear boilers.Two further features of successful nuclear organisation abroad were   the use ofarchitect engineers and consultants to handle power station projects so the nuclearcompanies offered only the nuclear boilers and a home market for reactors of a type which was also required in export markets.3    BNF felt that the sea should be slimmed down and its function limited to basicresearch.   (They also thought it was overmanned)   They said that the fragmentation ofthe present organisation - leaving responsibility for R 8c D with the sea, for fuel withBNFL and for reactor design with the design and construction (d/c) companies - had hadan inhibiting effect on the industry at home and had damaged their competitivepotential overseas.   The break in the industrial chain between design and development,in sharp contrast to the practice abroad, was particularly unhealthy.    Industry had tohave control of the reactor development and one way of achieving this might be to setup a Nuclear Industry Council to co-ordinate and direct all reactor development in the uk.b)    British Nuclear Design and Construction Ltd (BNDC), 19 November 1971^    The present relationship between the d/c companies and the sea was inherentlyunstable.   Much of sea&apos;s engineering work was unbeatable technically but the underlyingR &amp; D programme had to be defined by the d/c company responsible for selling the design,whether or not the sea still carried out the work.   The sea had fulfilled its usefulnessand was now an obstacle to the commercialisation of nuclear power.   It was substantiallySECRET
overstaffed by R &amp; D men who could more usefully be employed by the boiler makers.The Reactor Policy Committee provided an inadequateinterface between the authority and industry but the existence of 2 d/c companies was an obstacle to correcting thisrelationship.5    6 March 1972BNDC suggested that there wasn&apos;t*t room for two companies competing on the same system in the UK market and that we should move towards the situation where there would be aseparate group in the UK for each system, thermal or fast.   These groups would probablybe physically and geographically separate but they would have common managementprovided by G.C and close links with the fuel company.   Each group would be free toform its own international links.The fast reactor group in particular would be formed by a &quot;merger&apos; in some appropriateform of BNDC and TNPG and could look to a close association with KWU.6    22 MarchBNDC expressed the view that while international collaboration was a praiseworthy aimwe ought first to seek to strengthen our own nuclear organisation.   To this end any new company responsible for designing reactor should have close links with the fuel company and should be given control of the expenditure on reactor R&amp;D.   The work could stillbe carried out in the sea but the new organisation would determine the programme anddispense the money granted it by HMS.   BNFL could also be strengthened if it were givencontrol of the sea&apos;s fuel enclaves at Springfields and wind scale.EXTRACT FROM MINUTES OF 23 MEETING OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF BNDCHELD ON 21 MARCH 19727   The industrial shareholders found it difficult to make proposals when industry wasnot in the position to determine the product which should be sold to the homeGenerating Boards, and had no control over the use which was made of research anddevelopment expenditure funded by the Government.   In any proposal it would be necessaryto ensure that industry was in control of research and development work and the marketing of the complete product, which should include nuclear fuel.8   Mr J C C Stewart (Deputy Chairman of BNDC, personal views), 27 April 1972Mr Stewart said that he envisaged a new nuclear company headed by G.C.   Provided G.C hada majority holding in the new group it would avoid the weakness inherent in consortia and could usefully include other minority shareholders: possible candidates could beClarke-Chapman, Faireys and Rolls Royce.   The best way to link the group to BNFL wouldbe to allot it 2% of BNFL&apos;s equity subject to GECs having no liability for business in particular areas, such as the centrifuge project. In this way G.C would gain controlof fuel element fabrication but they would also want control of the design of the fuel
element, which would probably mean HMG agreeing to pay them to run parts of theAEA.Sir Hector McNeil (Chairman of BNDC, personal views), 25 Hay 1972 -9   Sir Hector said that both d/c companies now recognised that there was only room for one company in the UK.   He thought that G.C and the boilermakers should be involved in the new company and that private industry would hold the controlling interest, with the Government and the sea together taking a minority shareholding.The company would design and construct nuclear islands and would also be capable of undertaking turn-key contracts abroad.   It was important that both the boilermakerswere involved in        nuclear design and Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Clarke Chapman-John Thompsonhad agreed that they could find a way of sharing the work,,The Nuclear Power Group (TNPG), 15 March 197210    The European market could support only one nuclear group in the short term.   Anew European company could be built around TNPG&apos;s and BNFL&apos;s existing links with KWUand smaller Dutch and Belgian concerns.   But the UK industry&apos;s present weakstate would confine it to the role of junior partner in any partnership with KWU andwe should first seek to consolidate our nuclear organisation before looking abroad.WPG&apos;6 proposed move to the sea&apos;s establishment at Risley would strengthen the company^links with sea and BNFL and could form the basis of a powerful UK industry.Sir Edwin McAlpine (Chairman of TNPG), 9 May 197211    Sir Edwin said he accepted that a single UK design and construction (d/c) company was probably now desirable although he was not yet convinced that it was necessary.He suggested that the new company should be built around the boiler makers and BNFL,I who would both take substantial shareholdings, and that the civil engineers should alsobe involved.   Sir Edwin recognised that the division of responsibility for reactordevelopment between the sea and the consortia had been a major weakness of the UKindustry and he proposed that the company would take over the direction of the programme and would place contracts with the sea for the work they wanted done.   The company wouldbe located at Risley.d)    GECLord Nelson (Chairman of G.C) 10 February12    In the US the development of commercial reactors was in the hands of largeprosperous concerns such as Westinghouse and Government funds were directed into theI industry.   By contrast the amount of Government money spent in industry in the UK wasIsmail, the R&amp;D programme being funded instead through the sea, and apart from GECthe shareholders in the d/c companies were not comparable in strength to foreign competitors.   We thus had the situation of the weak consortia trying to bridge the gap between sea&apos;s technology and CEGB*s demands but having no control over the development programme on which their business depended.SECRET
13    The consortia lacked commercial direction and their members&apos; preoccupation withobtaining work for themselves had led to a lack of proper discipline.   The managementshould properly be the responsibility of a strong and flourishing concern ofinternational repute.   This was particularly important if we were to play a major role in any collaborative venture.   It was also vital that the funds for reactor development should be placed in the hand of the organisation responsible for its sale, manufacture and construction.1^    Lord Nelson stressed that G.C wanted to be firmly involved in the fast reactorbusiness and they would not tolerate this being left to TNPG.Sir Arnold Weinstock (Managing Director of G.C), 17 May 197215    Sir Arnold said that there was only room for a single company in the UK, and thatit should not be a loose consortium but should come under strong commercial management.G.C was the only company in the nuclear business that could provide this.16 The new company would maintain the capability to offer complete nuclear stationsbecause although this was not now necessary at home, overseas projects were generallyhandled on a turn key basis. It would also take over the management of the existingAGR contracts but would not accept other parties&apos; liabilities. The new company wouldtake on the staff of the d/c companies (initially all of them) and, at a later stage,the sea staff at Risley (excluding the Safety and Reliability people). Staggering thestaff transfers in this way would avoid too much disruption all at once.17    The Government would finance reactor development and the construction of prototypereactors but the new company would take the lead in the formulation of the programme.The programme would be agreed with the rest of the industry and Government, and if government wanted to pursue a course against the commercial judgement of the company itwould have to accept the financial consequences.18    Sir Arnold said that he saw no room in the company for either the civil engineersor the boiler makers but he thought that the sea might take a shareholding.   As to international links, any collaboration with Westinghou6e could only be confined tolicence agreements, a merger with Westinghouse&apos;s European interests was not possible without loss of control and this would not be acceptable/to G.C.   They had investigatedthe possibility of a merger with Siemens and Kraftwerk Union (KWU) but had concluded that KWU had not yet sensibly rationalised the nuclear interests of its parentcompanies and had still to Btraighten itself out.   In the longer term, however, they felt that collaboration with KWU on both fast and thermal reactors would be useful.
G.C Reactor Equipment Ltd, January 197219    The UK nuclear industry was inefficient and the present fragmented structurewas itself the main barrier to effective organisation.   Government funds forreactor R&amp;D were channelled through the sea with the result that the R&amp;Dprogramme was isolated from commercial pressures and from industry&apos;s needs.   The d/ccompanies were weak financially, they had no control of the R &amp; D on which theirdesigns were based, no part in the fuel business and were tied to their shareholdersfor supply of much of the equipment.   This was very different from the situationin other countries where the reactor companies were strong, established engineeringcorporations who already had substantial business outside the nuclear field; who had corcontrol of their own R&amp;D and fuel business; and who could give the required overallguarantees on the nuclear boiler.   Component supply was put out to competitive tenderand architect-engineers assumed responsibility for the construction of the stationother than the nuclear boiler.20    An important part of any re-organisation of the industry should be a change inthe role of the sea.   It should still carry out fundamental research but its reactorR&amp;D activities should be controlled by industry.   Staff would be seconded to the AEAfrom industry and a Nuclear Policy Committee with representatives from industry, HMG,the utilities and the sea would control the allocation of Government funds.e)     Babcock &amp; Wilcox and Clarke Chapman - John Thompson, 25 Hay 197221    The boiler makers said that if there were to be a single d/c company they would both want to play a significant part in it.   Each comp.any would have a shareholdingin the new company and they would make arrangements to share the boiler work.   BNELwould also have a shareholding and the electrical plant manufacturers would probably have to be included.   If the AGR or HTR were to be continued the civil engineers tooshould be represented.22    The new company would still be a consortium.   It would take over the responsibilit;for determining the relevant part of the sea&apos;s R&amp;D programme but it would not havecontrol of the sea&apos;s facilities or responsibility for managing them.   The boiler makersbelieved that the new company would be in a position to make strong links with european counterparts but that details of collaboration could only be worked out whenthe company was established and knew what it was going to sell.Mr Woodeson (Chairman of Clarke Chapman - John Thompson, personal views),Hay 197223    Mr Woodeson recognised that the nuclear industry was moving towards the idea ofa single nuclear d/c company.   He said that the new company should not only design and construct the nuclear island but should also design the fuel; and that if it wereto be successful it would have to have complete responsibility for the developmentSECRET
and commercial exploitation of its product, a responsibility which hitherto hadbeen unsatisfactorily divided between the sea and the consortia.   The new companycould only really take over this role if it had control of the funds for reactor R&amp;D.Hr Woodeson suggested that it should take over management responsibility for the relevant sea laboratories (eg Risley) and that the money needed to operate them shouldbe channelled through the company, who would formulate their own development programmes and submit them to Government for approval.f)    Atomic Energy AuthorityHr Doggett (Deputy Chairman of sea, in a paper agreed with Sir John Hill (Chairman))12 May 19722k    Mr Doggett&apos;6 paper considered tha changes in responsibility for reactor R&amp;Dconsequent on a change in the structure of the present d/c companies.   He assumed that a single new nuclear company would be formed, based on either one or two boileror turbine manufacturers or both and that BNFL might take a large shareholding.   TheAEA would also have a stake in the company.25    The new company would design and construct nuclear islands but it would alsomaintain the capability of co-ordinating a turn key project if this seemed desirable.To function efficiently the company would have to take over from sea some financial andtechnical responsibility for the reactor R&amp;D programme: this raised the questions of how great a transfer of responsibility would be necessary, and of legislation.26   Mr Doggett argued that the need for an early decision on the reorganisation of the nuclear industry precluded any change in the sea&apos;s responsibilities that would require legislation.   A possible, immediate solution would be to give the company responsibilityfor formulating and monitoring the development programme carried out by the authority and to transfer about 50 of the sea&apos;b staff to enable them to do so.   This could probably be achieved by a   combination of voluntary transfers and secondments.   Thenew company would be given a development contract for the reactor programme.   In consultsation with the generating boards, the sea and the nuclear industry it would determine the scope and content of the contract and would subcontract the work, probably almostentirely to the sea.   The development contract itself would be placed by the sea afteragreement with HMG. /.
27    Such a course would leave the Authority substantially unchanged but amore far-reaching change requiring legislation might be a longer term objective.   In any event Government would need to keep within its control the capacity to support its overall nuclear policy and to evaluate and monitorindustry&apos;s development work, and the responsibility for safety and inspection.It would need to retain the Research Group and both Winfrith and Dounreay.The three Reactor Group laboratories with the staff of about 600 professionalscould be transferred to the new company and to BNFL.   But Mr Doggett stressed that the Authority had suffered many changes in the last few years and any suchsolution must form part of a complete and final decision on its future if theprogress of its work and its staff relations were not to be jeopardised.   such large scale staff trnasfers to the new company would be easier if its futurewere assured by the Government, probably by Government or BNFL taking a majorshareholding.g)     British Nuclear Fuels Ltd (BNFL)Dr Franklin (Managing Director of BNFL, personal views) 16 March 197228    BNFL felt that the future UK nuclear programme would not sustain 2 d/ccompanies.   It was, however, no answer for the present companies to look to european partnerships because   they were and could only expect to be smallsubsidiaries of the powerful European firms.   BNFL recognised that fuel business was a source of strength for a   reactor company and saw themselves playing animportant role in bringing together the d/c companies and strengthening the UKnuclear industry, and in forging international links.29    Foreign participation in BNFL (currently contrary to government policy, partly on defence grounds) could provide a useful basis for aninternational company.   A possible partner for BNFL was Kraftwerk Union(KWU) of Germany and the KWU agreements with The Nuclear Power Group (TNPG)would facilitate the formation of a UK/KWG company.    xBut KWU had their ownfuel line and might not see advantage in these proposals and a partnership withWestinghouse might anyway be more,fruitful for BNFL and the UK.   Westinghousewished to establish a fuel cycle business in Europe and had indicated that ifthey succeeded in buying a 25$ stake in BNFL they could be expected to centretheir European fuel effort on BNFL.   Moreover G.C already had links withWestinghouse and it was possible that a UK/KWU link might prompt G.C andWestinghouse to join forces to compete against the new company in both reactorsand fuel.
Sir John Hill (Chairman SEQirJlFL&apos; and sea) 12 April 1972j50    Sir John said that all the inadequacies of the British nuclear industrystemmed from the misconception that it was possible to carry out the developmentof reactors in one organisation and then leave another to design and build projects of the size and complexity of a nuclear power station.   The central aim of anyre-organisation should be to remove the &quot;difficult interface&apos; between theengineering, R&amp;D and testing carried out in the sea and the design teams in industry.31    He suggested setting up a new company (called British Nuclear Boilers (BNB))owned 50&amp; by BNFL, with the 2 boiler-makers. (Clarke Chapman-John Thompson andBabcock and Wilcox) taking large minority shareholdings and with other small minority shareholders.   The CEGB would also be represented on the Board.   BNBwould take over the staff and resources of the 2 consortia but not theresponsibility for their present contracts.   The staff would be seconded backto their parent company until the contracts were completed when they would-transfer permanently to BNB.   The company would itself take over the sea&apos;sengineering and component testing laboratories at Risley and in addition theAEA&apos;s fuel element development laboratories at Cpringfield and wind scale wouldbe transferred to BNFL.   This would involve about 1,600 staff.   It wouldprobably be possible to lease Risley and to second staff to the new companywithout further legislation but this would certainly be necessary for thetransfers to BNFL.   The laboratories would continue to be funded by Government.32    The new company would need strong European links if it were to competev/ith the large American companies.   KWU would be a useful partner in this field and the new company should seek to build on the existing TNPG-KWU link.h)      Sir Stanley Brown (Chairman of CEGB) 18 April 1972^Sir Stanley was speaking personally and not on behalf of the CEGB Board;/&apos;&quot;33    He was firmly convinced that to survive the UK nuclear industry could not continue alone but had to have strong links with European companies.   In the longrun the European market would support 2 competing companies but in the immediatefuture there was only room in the UK for one national/ company if we were torealise the strength we needed before approaching Europe.   The boiler makers had indicated that they favoured a move towards a single nuclear company but he feltthey were not strong enough financially to produce the necessary leadership.His guess was that a nuclear division of G.C would emerge: an alternative wouldbe hard to find.   But whatever the outcome it was vital that the new company should have a part in the fuel business.3^    Sir Stanley stressed that HMG should not contemplate launching the company with an advanced order for a power station.   Unwanted capacity was about themost expensive way of giving support.
(i)      The Institution of Professional Civil Servants (IPCS) 29 March35    The IPCS had consistently been in favour of a single nuclear company,preferably with a majority Government shareholding held through the sea or,more likely, BNFL.   They had strong objections to GECs taking a large part inthe nuclear business and said that if the result of reorganisation were thatGEC emerged in a dominant position then IPCS would strongly and publicly opposeit.
