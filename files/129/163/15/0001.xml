INTERNATIONAL COMPUTERS LIMITEDJoint Memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Civil Service Department and the central policy Review staff.     EPC(72)14th Meeting Item 3 decided that the future of ICL could only be effectively ensured by means of an international partnershiD;  the possible formsof partnership needed to be established very quickly; and that in the meantimeassistance should be limited to what was necessary in the short term in order toallow time for negotiations to proceed.2.     The DTI paper takes a different course and there are serious doubts about it which can be summarised as follows.1.       ICL Faces Tough Competitiona.     IBM holds 60/70% of the major European markets.    It runs neckand neck with ICL in this country and is the market leader in theprivate sector.b. Production costs in terms of pence per *S are roughly asfollows:-IBM 15oOther major American companies 40pICL 56pc. Productivity per employee is roughly as followsIBM $40,000Other major American companies $30/35,000ICL $13,000d.     ICL&apos;s major international competitors/already have.on offer,or have announced, new machines comparable in size with the ICL NewRange.    The Japanese are coming up fast;ii.    ICL&apos;s Capabilitya. The new ICL management are energetic, enthusiastic and capablebut have had scant time to examine the-&apos;Company&apos; s future course.1
b. During the next few years ICL will be at its most vulnerable asit phases out an old range and introduces a new one.c. The design of ICL&apos;s New Range is good, but the software, on&quot; which&quot;the system depends, has a long wayyat to go and will be crucial tosales prospects.iii- Other Factorsa.    The national administrative structure is already heavily deDendenton comnuters and will become more so.    The Government as a comnuteruser is too deeply committed to a single firm.b.&quot;   ICL&apos;s estimates-of its needs for Government support have fluctuatedwidely over the past few months.    There must be a real risk that the launching of the New Range  (which may be accompanied by a fall in the sales of its current products) will meet unforeseen difficulties whichwill require a&apos; further Government rescue operation in unfavourablecircumstances.c.      Public confidence in a Ccmnany which may pay no dividends for years is unlikely to be strong.3.     Therefore we take the view that ICL can only survive in the longer-term onthe basis of an international partnership because it does not have a wide enoughmarket base in its own right given the aggressive marketing tactics of its competitors and the firm manufacturing basis some of them have already establishein this country.    The moment to forqe links is now when ICL still has bargaininapower.4.     ICL must have short term assistance and there must be no question of trying to sell the Company short.    But we need a much more thorough examination of possible arrangements with other companies. The talks with Burroughs have been of a preliminary nature.    There have been no detailed discussions so far withHoneywell or Univac.5.     It would seem best to proceed as follows:-i. The full range of international possibilities should be urgentlyexamined by the Working Party already set up by EPC    This examination should include not only Burroughs but other American companies, European   -companies and possibly even Japanese partners.    A basic objective shouldbe retention of a substantial manufacturing and R&amp;D capability in theUnited Kingdom.ii. ICL will need financial assistance over the next few months and support from the Government for the development of its New Range.    this could be the  14.2M to secure their cash flow pending the outcome of the studies referred to above.    At the same time if should be made clear that,this sum is conditional upon ICL vigorously exploring links with other companies in close association with Government.K.B.CP.R.S.Civil Service DepartmentCentral Policy Review Staff16 June 1972CONFIDENTIAL
