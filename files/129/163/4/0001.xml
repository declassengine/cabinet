HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(72) 54 COPY NO     g &apos;19 May 1972CABINETPUBLIC PRESENTATION OF GOVERNMENT policy memorandum by the Prime Minister1. When Ministers meet at Chequers on 22 May I believe it would be valuable, if time permits, to discuss the progress that has been made in improving the public presentation of Government policy since the meetingon Government strategy on 8 October 1971,    A number of proposals were set out in my paper CP(71) 106:  and I should like to take stock on where west and with regard to them,2,        I believe that considerable progress has been made, especially with regard to Ministerial broadcasting.    The Governments case has,for example, so far come over much more clearly during the rail paydispute than it did during the mineworkers&apos; pay dispute.    We have also made progress in relating policy decisions to overall strategy and onplacing more emphasis on the quality of life aspect,3. But I think we should review what further action is required.    Inparticular I should like my colleagues to consider how well their departments are using presentation as a possible weapon at their disposaland how far they are taking advantage of the different opportunitiesavailable for the presentation of their policies.    These opportunitiesinclude -a. Parliamentary - statements, lobby briefings, White/GreenPapers,b. Extra-Parliamentary - radio/television interviews, speechesPress conferences, articles, on-the-record briefings,c. Publicity - Press/tele vision advertising, exhibitions,campaigns.1
4.        The Central Policy Review staff s review indicates that it will beuphill work for the Government in the second half of this Parliament,That re-emphasises the importance of making the most of everypresentational opportunity open to us.E H10 Downing Street19 May 19722
