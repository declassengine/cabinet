S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72)53 COPY NO   6315 May 1972CABINETFUTURE FINANCING OF THE RESEARCH COUNCILSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for education and science .        I am greatly concerned at the demands which have been made upon the Department of Education and Science science vote bycustomer departments.    I must emphasise the gravity of the issues which these raise for the Research Council system.    Neither the council&apos;s nor I oppose the customer-contractor principle.    We allwant to make the Councils more responsive to the needs of executivedepartments.    The sole issue is the scale and timing of the transferof funds from the science vote.2. Lord Rothschild1 s Report proposed transfers of 25 per cent from the Medical Research Council (MRC), 50 per cent from theNatural Environment Research Council (NERC), and 75 per cent fromthe Agricultural Research Council (ARC); that is, some  27 million from the combined Research and Development (R and D) budget of 57 million of these three Councils.    More recently, as an alternative,he has suggested phasing the transfers over three years and limiting thetransfer from the ARC to 60 per cent.    The transfers would not bemade until Departments had appropriate Chief Scientist organisationsin being.3. The Research Councils and the Council for Scientific Policy(CSP) offered to transfer some  7 million.    I would be prepared to go further.4. The customer departments want all that Lord Rothschildproposed, and immediately.    The Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, who has yet to set up a Chief Scientist organisation, wants90 per cent of the ARC budget this year.5. The Select Committee on Science and Technology recommendedthat no transfers be made until R and D at present being done by departments had been more fully investigated.    They are right in my view to urge a more gradual, less arbitrary, approach, but the greaterneed is to settle the Research Councils1 future without delay.1
6. The Government, as the scientific community sees it, have entered into three commitments affecting them.7. First, full consultation was promised, accepted and carried out.It was the most notable example of open Government we can claim. the scientific community will see it as a mockery if no account whatsoever istaken of their deep-felt representations.8. Second, the Government have given what the scientific communityregard as a pledge that the viability and integrity of the Councils andtheir work will be maintained.    It is no good our saying that the Councilswill retain overall management responsibility.    Eminent scientists joinCouncils to maintain the direction, quality, relevance and practicability of the scientific programme, not to manage the nuts and bolts; officialscan do that.    As for programme management, transfers on the scaleDepartments want must cut back the base for the Councils own charterfunctions and duties.    The ARC would have a quarter left and the annexshows what would happen to the NERC.    It would be humbug to pretend that this was maintaining their scientific viability and integrity.9. Third, the Government stated its intention to preserve the research Councils under the sponsorship of the Department of education and Science and a body to give me authoritative advice.    I cannot say what individual members of the Councils and the CSP might&apos;do (though am clear what they will say).   Some might resign, but I think - and hope - that most will consider it their duty to stay and cope with theconsequences.   But I seriously doubt whether it will be seen as sensibleby them or by me to continue to maintain a family of five such lopsidedCouncils as might be left (SRC  51 million,   MRC  17 million,NERC  8 million, ARC  4 million, Social Science Research Council 2. 2 million).    Some major regrouping would be essential;  mostcharters would need to be modified;  staff transferred (and some possiblydismissed);  and the role, if any, of the CSP re-examined.    This would hardly pass as preserving the Research Councils.10.       The blunt fact is that, within the compass of current sciencebudgets, we cannot both satisfy the stated needs of customer departments and at the same time maintain the viability of all the Councils and thuspreserve   the present Research Council system.    It is for mycolleagues in other Departments&apos;to decide what they need.    But I must emphasise that we are not just juggling with figures and are dealing with more than the principle of the customer-contractor principle.    I judgethat, if we move too far and too fast, we are in serious risk of provokinga crisis mf confidence in the scientific community and even of destroying a system that has served this country well.11.       The clear message from the comments we have received isthat the present system can best be improved by strengthening the partnership between the Councils and Government.    This should be doneby making customer departments full members of the Research councils and of the body which advises on the allocation of money to them so as to2
influence the whole of their programmes.    This could hardly beachieved by consent with transfers on the scale suggested, but itcould perfectly well be combined with some customer commissioningand I am ready to see some transfers from the science budget for thispurpose.    It will, however, be essential that any plans announced inthe White Paper should leave the three councils a base of department of Education and Science funds for their own charterfunctions which I would put at some  50 million in 1971 terms betweenthem.    This would leave about  10 million for transfer in 1973 whichcould rise to  17 million by 1977 on present assumptions regarding thegrowth of the science budget, but of course there would be nothing to stop Departments commissioning more than this from their ownR and D funds ( 277 million in 1971-72, leaving defence out of account).12.       This would allow a new system of partnership, which we would announce in the White Paper, to be established in an atmosphere of mutual confidence.    We might then think it sensible in a few years1time to have another look at the extent of transfer in the light of experience.    But first we need to give the new system a chance to work.We should do nothing to prejudice this now.M t department of Education and Science15 May 19723
(confide ntTal)Copy No.      UtiANNEXETHE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH council the NERC came into existence in 1965, as a direct result of the TrendReport (Cmnd 2171 ) which recommended the creation of a new research council to bring together a number of research activities in the field of the natural resources which had hitherto been carried out in partby separate agencies.    It is charged by its Charter to encourage and support research in the earth sciences and ecology, particularlygeology, meteorology,  seismology, geomagnetism, hydrology,  oceanography,forestry, nature conservation,  fisheries or marine and freshwaterbiology.    To achieve this end the council*s budget has been steadilyincreased from  4m in 1965-66 to  18m in 1972-73.    The rate of growthhas now slowed down considerably because of the two lots of cuts imposedsince 1970, but the council do not regard their programme as having yet reached an adequate level in all these sciences.2.      The council&apos;s research programme is divided into five main fields(Earth, Seas, Inland Waters, Terrestial Environment and Wildlife, and the atmosphere) all of which are multi-disciplinary and involve a numberof separate establishments.    New subjects are emerging and need supportby basic research.    Only NERC is able to consider the needs of allthese sciences as a whole.    Most of the council*s projects and services serve several interests and are not really accountable to any single customer.3.      If the transfer of funds to major customer departments were onthe scale suggested in Lord Rothschild1s report, only one half of thetotal budget of NERC would be available to support activities for whichnone of the four major &quot;customer&quot; departments could be expected tosupply funds.    Aftervprovision had been made for the British AntarcticSurvey,  the Research Vessel Base,  the Geological Museum, and othercapital facilities,  a wholly inadequate amount would be left for thesupport of basic research in 15 institutes covering the whole range of the environmental sciences and in the universities.(confidential)
