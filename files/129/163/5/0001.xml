ANNEXRHODESIA:  DRAFT PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT1. With your permission, Mr Speaker, and that of the House, I wishto make a statement about Rhodesia.2. On 25 November 1971 I announced the appointment of a commission under Lord Pearce to ascertain whether the Proposals for a settlement which I had agreed with Mr Smith were acceptable to the Rhodesian people as a whole.    The Pearce Commission have completed their difficult taskwith independence, skill and devotion and the text of their comprehensiveReport will be in the Vote Office when I sit down.    The Government arevery grateful to Lord Pearce and his fellow Commissioners.3. Lord Pearce and his Vice-Chairman have reached the conclusionfirst that the great majority of those who gave their opinions to theCommission had a sufficient understanding of the content and implications of the Proposals to pass judgment on them;   second, that the proposals were acceptable to the great majority of Europeans; third, that themajority of Africans rejected them.    The Commission have thereforeconcluded that the people of Rhodesia as a whole did not regard theProposals as acceptable as a basis for independence.    They explainin detail their reasons for reaching this conclusion, their approach totheir task and the methods which they used for testing opinion.    Theyconsider the extent and effect of intimidation, the validity of the claim that the Chiefs speak for their people on political matters, the measureof understanding of the Proposals and the reasons given for acceptanceor rejection of them.    Inevitably there are some paragraphs which dealwith particularly contentious issues and which will be widely and properlydebated both here and in Rhodesia.4.        When Hon Members have read the Report I hope that they will studyonce again the terms of the proposed settlement for although the proposals have failed to gain acceptance they still represent a genuine attempt to finda sensible and in all the circumstances a just solution of Rhodesia&apos;special social and political problems,5,        Hon Members will find in the Report a wide variety of views expressed by people of all races.    I hope that particular attention willbe given to those opinions and memoranda given by persons who are clearlyintent upon furthering multi-racial co-operation.6. They illustrate very clearly the dilemma facing anyone who triesto re-establish in Rhodesia the basis for a multi-racial society.
7. The choice lies starkly between a compromise settlement which bydefinition will not wholly satisfy anyone but which will gain for the Africansa foot in the door of evolutionary political change, and a rapid and complete polarisation of the races and the prospect of certain conflict&apos;.8.        It may be that on further reflection the majority of Rhodesians,African and European, will decide to choose the way of compromise andto work together for orderly political change.   I devoutly hope so for the sake of all Southern Africa,9. It will be apparent to Hon Members that the negotiations ofNovember followed by the Pearce Report have created a situationin which many new ideas will be current and in which positions whichhitherto have been inflexible, could become more fluid.    It is cleartherefore that in these circumstances there must be time for reflection,particularly by Rhodesians, for it is from there that any fresh ideas must come.10,       Her Majesty&apos;s Government feel that plenty of time should be givenin which the position can be clarified.    We feel that the best atmospherefor constructive discussion and advance will be given if from the start we continue the situation as it is today, including sanctions, until we can judge whether or not an opportunity for a satisfactory settlement willoccur once more.    If there are to be processes of consultation insideRhodesia they will take a considerable time.    Accordingly it is likely that we shall have to ask for the renewal of the sanctions order inNovember,    Meanwhile Her Majesty&apos;s Government will keep everyoption open,11,        There will be some who on reading the Report will feel thatwe have done all that can be expected of us as far as helping the Rhodesiansback to legality is concerned and that we should wash our hands of thematter from now on,    I must in honesty say to all Rhodesians that weare very nearly at the end of the road in our ability to help them to asolution of their problems.    But I would ask Hon Members to remember that Britain is the only country which can restore to Rhodesia its inter-national status and Britain is the only country which can, by the meansof a settlement, legally lift sanctions off their shoulders.  For these reasons whatever tomorrow may hold I trust that Hon Members may feel,when they have read the Report, that we should not cut off hope from rhodesia today,    A debate on these matters can be arranged throughthe usual channels.2
