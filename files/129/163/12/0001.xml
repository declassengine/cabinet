The Report covers the remuneration of all the 68, 000 doctors and dentists taking any part in the National Health Service in Great Britain.It recommends increases from 1 April 1972, which would increase the total net remuneration of National Health Service doctors and dentists by about 27 million (8.0 per cent).    The Report also recommends increases in the gross remuneration of general medical practitioners to cover increases intheir practice expenses.    The Review Body indicates that it proposes duringthe coming year to consider what further changes if any should be made indoctors&apos; and dentists&apos; remuneration from April 1973.,3.        The percentage increases recommended for the main groups are asfollows:Hospital Consultants and other 7.5 per centCareer GradesHospital Training Grades ranging from average of . 5 per cent for House officers to 15. 6 per cent for SeniorRegistrarsGeneral Medical Practitioners(net intended remuneration) 7. 5 per centGeneral Dental Practitioners(target average net income) 8. 5 per cent

(Cmnd 4825, December 1971).Review Body on Doctors(Cmnd 4352, May 1970).2Review Body on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration.   Twelfth Report.introduction.     We were appointed in July 1971 as a standing Review Body and were asked to make recommendations, in the first instance, for the period april 1971 - March 1972.   As this period was already well advanced by the time wewere able to begin work we proceeded as quickly as possible and oompletedour first report by the end of October 1971.   It was accepted by theGovernment and published in December. 12.    We described in the report the circumstances that led up to ourappointment.   Briefly, our predecessors, a standing Review Body under thechairmanship of Lord Kindersley with similar terms of reference to our own,2made a report   in March 1970   recommending a 30 per cent increase in the pay of all ESS doctors and dentists to take effect on 1 April 1970 and last for two years.   The Government of the day referred part of this recommendatimfor further advice to the National Board for Prices and Incomes and theKindersley Review Body resigned.   At the time of our appointment theposition was that doctors and dentists in the training grades of the hospital service had received an increase of 30 per cent while other doctors and dentist,generally speaking, had received 20 per cent.3.   We received comprehensive memoranda of evidence from the Health departments and the professions but because of the need to report quickly we were obligedto leave a number of questions for review in later reports and to base our report of the Review Body on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration, 1971.
CONFIDENTIALrecommendations on considerations directly relevant to the year in question.   Ourbasic recommendation was for an increase of 8 per cent in the current remuneration of those who had already received 20 per cent,   with lesser amounts for those whDhad received up to 30 per cent. This meant that for practical purposes the position from April 1971 onwards was virtually the same as it would have been if therecommendations of the Kindersley Review Body had been implemented in full.   Wearrived at our recommendation, however, without reference to the considerationsregarding long-term movements in earnings that had led our predecessors to theirs.As we explained in the report,we were unable at the time to make an assessment of changes in earnings over a long period as our predecessors had.   We also decidedto depart from their practice in an important respect.   They had generallyrecommended.levels of remuneration to last for two or three years at a time,and had tried to ensure that the levels would be right on average over each period.They had therefore set levels that were too high at the beginning of the period in the expectation that they would he overtaken by inflation and he too low atthe end.   We decided to recommend the remuneration that we believed would be right at the time our recommendations came into effect, recognising that this might make it necessary to carry out reviews more frequently than our predecessors-successors did.   We consider that until inflation has been brought under a greater measure of control a two or three year review period must entail hardship unless we are to provide for inflation in advance, a procedure that we firmly reject.4,     In this report we recommend the levels of remuneration to apply from 1 April1972.   We have been helped, as before, by written and oral evidence from the health Departments and the Tresury and on behalf of the medical and dental pro-confessions from the Joint Evidence Committee^ and the British Dental Association(BDA).   In accordance with the established practice we havealso been ready to^The Joint Evidence Committee represents the Central Committee for Hospital medical services, the Hospital Junior Staff Group Council and the General medical services Committee.   By agreement with the BDA it speaks for dentists in thehospital service, as well as for doctors; the BDA speaks for general dental practitioners.2
CONFIDENTIALconsider written evidence from other bodies and have received a memorandum from the Regional Hospitals Consultants and Specialists Association and a shortdocument from the Association of Scientific, Technical and Managerial Staffs onbehalf of the junior hospital doctors section of that union.   The JuniorHospital Doctors Association, which sent us evidence in 1971, added some furthercomments on this occasion.   In the light of the evidence we received this yearand in 1971 we have been able to go more deeply into questions we were barelyable to consider, for lack of time, on the last occasion.   We have also carriedout enquiries of our own into the qualities of candidates seeking entry to medical and dental schools and into the movements of earnings in medicine and dentistry,in relation to other occupations, during the last decade   or more.   These.matters are dealt with in Chapters 2 and 4*5.     The Joint Evidence Committee argued in their evidence that there was acase, based on the general movement of earnings and prices, for an increase of10 per cent in the remuneration of the medical profession as a whole.   Theyclaimed additional increases, for special reasons, for particular sections ofthe profession.   The BDA, following its normal practice, did not claim any specific increase but left us to determine the amount in the light of thematters that were brought to our attention in its evidence.   We discuss thecase for a general increase in Chapter 4 in the light of the conclusions drawn from our study of the long-term movements of earnings and of the evidence aboutmanpower and workloads in the two professions that we set out in Chapters 2 and3.   In Chapters 5 - 8 we make recoirmandations about the remuneration of different sections of the professions and deal with certain specific points.   Finally in chapter 9 we summarise our recommendations and state our intentions about thenext review.6.     Superannuation does not come directly within our terms of reference but it isnecessary to take account of doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; superannuation rights as partof the total value of their remuneration.   We hare had evidence about the existing3
4superannuation schemes and the Joint Evidence Committee have drawn our attentionto aspects of the schemes which the professions consider unsatisfactory and have tried to improve, so far without success, in negotiations with the Government.The Committee has asked that we should recommend the Government to rectify thesedeficiencies or, if we feel that our terms of reference prevent this, recommendeither that our own remit he extended to include superannuation or that the sub-ject be referred for separate independent review.   We do not Hink, however, thatany of these courses would be appropriate at the present time.   Pension schemes in the NHS and in other parts of the public sector are being reviewed by theGovernment in consultation with staff associations and other representative bodies; it would obviously create serious difficulties if changes in the pension schemes of doctors and dentists were considered in isolation from those of allother public employees.   We therefore consider that the professions should con-tinue to deal with superannuation matters by direct negotiations with theGovernment.   When the negotations have been completed we propose to consider how the outcome compares with the superannuation rights available in otherwalks of life and take the comparisons into account, as one of the elements in total remuneration, in our future recommendations.
MEDICAL AND DENTAL MANPOWER IN THE NHSDoctors7;    Doctors normally graduate from medical schools at the age ox 23 or 24and must then spend one year in house officer posts in approved hospitalsbefore they are eligible to apply for full registration with the general medical Council.   A doctor has a legal right to practise as a general practitioner in the NHS as soon as he is fully registered;   but the greatmajority spend several more years in hospital posts as house officers ormore usually senior house officers, and perhaps later as registrars.   Theage of entry into general practice is generally about 30.   Doctors who remainin the hospital service pass through a similar succession of house officer,senior house officer and registrar posts, so that the choice between thehospital service and general practice is not necessarily made until someyears after graduation;   but doctors who intend to remain in the hospital service normally try to obtain posts which enable them to concentrate in-increasingly on their chosen specialty.   They typically spend about two post-registration years as senior house officers and four or five as registrars.   Atthis point the final decision is usually made to stay in the hospital service with a view to seeking a consultant appointment in due course.   Doctors who make this choice normally spend four or five years in senior registrar posts beforebecoming consultants. The median age of appointment as consultant is at present about 37.8,      The grades from house officer to senior registrar are known as &quot;traininggrades&quot; or &quot;junior grades&quot;.   The terms are somewhat unfortunate but we must use them for lack of an accepted alternative.   Doctors in the training grades are qualified (apart from those still in the pre-registration year \ with a right
CONFIDENTIALto enter general practice. They carry a heavy workload, are responsible for the care of patients and may have to take critical decisions.   Generally speaking howeverthey are also studying for further qualifications;   and they are in training inthe sense that within the hospital service it is the consultants who have theultimate clinical responsibility for the treatment of the patients in their departments by doctors in training.   The latter are in training to qualify forthis same ultimate responsibility.9t   &quot; In September 1971 there were more than 53,000 doctors in the NHS, of whom23,250 were &quot;unrestricted&quot; general practitioners and 30,CC0 were in thehospital service, including 11,500 consultants and 16,700 in the traininggrades.   consultants contracts (and, to a very limited extent, those ofother hospital grades) may allow them to devote part of their time to private practice.   The &quot;whole time equivalent&quot; of consultants employed in the NHS isabout 9*600.10,    It is well known tisat the NHS, and particularly the hospital service, isheavily dependent on doctors who were born outside the British Isles^ and obtained their first qualification in their own countries before cooing here.45per cent of the doctors in the training grades, 11 per cent of consultantsand 14 per cent of general practitioners were born overseas.Some of these overseas doctors settle here permanently, but many return to their own countries (or move to others) after gaining experiencehere, so that the proportions now in the training grades are, and are likely toremain, much higher than those in the career grades of consultant and general practitioner. /Statistics do not distinguish between doctors born in the United Kingdom andthose born in the Irish Republic.
CONFIDENTIAL11(      As we have indicated earlier, the doctors in the training grades area vital part of the hospital service and a situation in which nearly halfcome from overseas is clearly a dangerous one;   the inflow of foreign doctorsmight be reduced or the outflow increased at any time by developments beyond this country&apos;s control.   The situation has not come about, however, through ashortage of young people in this country wishing to train in medicine andqualified to do so.    htry into the medical profession has been limited by thenumber of places available in the medical schools, which were not expandedover a long period up to about 1960.   The number of places is now being increased; itwas 2,020 in i960, 2,870 in 1970 and is expected to be about 4,,100 by the late1970&apos;s.   The results of the expansion have become apparent in the last year or two and the recruitment of British-born doctors into the NHS now exceeds the recruit-ment Of foreign-born doctors.12,      If this trend is to continue it will be necessary to ensure that themedical profession continues to attract sufficient numbers of adequatelyqualified students with the right personal qualities to fill the increasing number of medical school places.   At present, there is no sign of difficulty; 7*577of the home and overseas applicants through UCCA for university places in1971 named medicine as their first choice of subject.   Places were available for under 40 per cent of them (compared with over 50 per cent, on average, of applicants for places in other faculties) so that medical students are more highly selectedthan university students in general.   This is a pattern that has existed for manyyears.   But we are not sure that it will necessarily continue after a further expansion of the medical schools has taken place, and we ^ave begun a study ofthe qualities of the present applicants to find out as much as we can about thewa;y things are likely to develop.   The first results of this study are given inAppendix I, and indicate that a significant number of medical candidatesrejected because of a lack of places were in fact suitable material,
and would have been accepted if places for them had been available. The studyalso showed that there was fairly general agreement that the standard of medical candidates had improved markedly in recent years.   We wish toexpress our gratitude to the UCCA and to the Deans of medical and dental echool3who kindly answered our enquiries.   We cannot do more than draw tentativeconclusions,  but we think it is reasonable to say that there is no reasonat present to foresee difficulty in filling the expanding medical schools.We shall continue to keep this matter under review.13. Entry into the profession is only one side 01. ihe coin, however.   Although2the HHS is virtually the sole employer of doctors in this country,     so that -a very high proportion of those who stay here will enter it, there is a con-siderable loss of British-born doctors by emigration.   It is difficult toobtain exact statistics since, even if it were possible to trace alldoctors1 movements (which is far from being the case) intentions may change.Many British doctors go overseas for relatively short periods, to work, study,or engage in research.   Some of these may decide to settle abroad.   Others wholeave the country with the intention of settling abroad may change their mindsand return.   But detailed studies carried out by the Health Departments andthe profession suggest that from 1966 to 1969 there was a net loss by emigrationeach year of some 400 to 45O doctors born in the British Isles.   The number of emigrants is believed to have fallen in 1969 and to be running at a lower level now but the evidence for these later years is less conclusive than thatfor earlier years.14. The reasons for emigration are even more difficult to ascertain than arethe statistics.   Doctors can earn very much more in some countries - especially the USA and Canada - than they can here, and it is natural to suppose thatthis plays some part.   This country clearly oannot match the levels of earnings2,   The main, alternatives to the NHS are employment by Local Authorities, theCivil Service, and the Armed Forces. Full time employment opportunitiesm private practice are limited.8
..  9   -   ...available to doctors or other professional men in North America, and to theextent that higher earnings are a motive for emigration some loss of British-born doctors must be accepted. Britain, on the other hand, benefits by aninflow of doctors from less developed countries, some of whom may be attracted by the possibility of higher earnings here.   It is debatable, however,whether higher earnings are the main reason for emigration.   Better academiccareer opportunities and better research facilities may also be an importantmotive.   Dissatisfaction with career prospects here and the frequent movesand uncertainty associated with the present system of hospital training, inwhich short-term training posts have to be competed for separately, may be an even more important consideration for younger doctors.   The Health departments and the professions are aware of the possible importance of these factors andare making efforts to improve the situation.15,   In the last year or two the increasing output from the medical schools,together with the fall that seems to have occurred in the rate of emigration, hasmeant that for the first time in several years the net intake into the HHS hasbeen predominantly of UK or Irish-born doctors, but the change was still not sufficient to stop the proportion of foreign-born doctors in the NHS as a wholerising (though it remained constant in the hospital service).   The proportionof OK and Irish doctors in the net intake may be expected to rise further but itis possible that the situation could worsen: for example, if British doctors were able to move more freely to Common Market countries, under regulations for the mutual recognition of qualifications that are being discussed, and chose to doso; or if the new health insurance scheme that is being established in the irish republic were to prove a powerful attraction for Irish-horn doctors practisinghere.   The situation must still be regarded as critical and will remain so untilthe proportion of British-bom doctors,. particularly in the hospital service,is considerably larger than it is today.
Dentists-!51   Dentists normally graduate at the age of 22 or 23, and are then eligible to apply for full registration with the General Dental Council.   A minorityspend some additional years in obtaining further qualifications, and a small number enter the hospital service where the staffing structure and rate of payare similar to those of hospital doctors. The majority go direct into general dental practice.17,   The total number of general dental practitioners in the NHS has risen,rather unevenly,      from 11,412 in i960 to 12,054 in 1971.   The average age has fallen considerably in this time, because there is a tendency for dentists to retire earlier than they did in the past.    More than 20 per cent of dentistsare now under 30.   The annual intake of students into dental schools increased by nearly 50 per cent in the last ten years, from 590 in 1962 to 878 in 1972.Generally speaking the available places are all filled and a further expansion of dental schools is planned.   The NHS does not rely to any important extent on overseas-born dentists and it does not appear that British dentists are emigratingin any large numbers, though the evidence on this point is less comprehensivethan it is for doctors.18. The Health Departments consider that the expanded dental schools will beable to train enough dentists to satisfy the needs of the NHS for the foreseeable future.   This assumes, however, that a high proportion of the places in the schools will be taken up.   As Appendix I shows, dental schools have beenexperiencing difficulty in filling all their places with candidates of the rightquality and have at present a&apos; much smaller margin of suitable candidates thanmedical schools have.   Furthermore, part of their intake consists of students who named medicine as their first choice of subject and would presumably have become doctors rather than dentists if they had been able to obtain medical,  10
.11school places.   There is some risk, therefore, that, in spite of the general increase in the number of school-leavers with A-level qualifications, the flow of students into the dental schools will diminish as the medical schools areexpanded.   Apart from the question of overall numbers, we cannot feel confident that there will always be enough students with the potential to become teachersof dentistry in the future.   Further, although the general standard of dentalhealth in this country has improved dramatically since the inception of the NHS,and is continuing to do so, there is still room for much more improvement.   Ifpeople in other regions visited dentists as often as those in London and theHome Counties the ratio of dentists to population would need to be greatlyincreased.   The Health Departments and the dental profession are considering thefuture of the dental services, including measures to improve the distributionof dental manpower, with the aim of raising standards of dental   health nationally.But the demand for dental services might well run ahead of these plans and indeedsteps ought to be taken to stimulate it.   All these considerations suggest thatin our future work we shall have to pay particular attention to the rate of recruitment to the dental profession.
3 confidential the WORKLOADS OF DOCTORS AND DENTISTS^t     For doctors and dentists, as for other professional men, it would be inappropriate, even if it were possible, to adjust remuneration so as to take account of minor variations in the amount of work done.   We do not intend toattempt this; but our predecessors, the Kindersley Review Body, were impressed by the heavy burden of work undertaken by doctors and dentists in the NHS and took it into account in their recommendations.   For our part we think itnecessary to consider whether, in the longer term, the workload of doctors and dentists is increasing or decreasing in relation to the workloads of other professions and occupations.20.     At first sight there are reasons for supposing that the load on hospital doctors has been reduced.    The following table, showing changes over the last ten years, indicates that the ratio of doctors to patients has improved.England and Wales	In-patient discharges and deaths	Beds occupied (daily average)	Outpati ent attendances	Doctors in training grades	Doctors in career grades1960	4,136,000	410,000	41,746,000	9,569	6,9881970	5,329,000	372,000	48,097,000	13,443	9,110fc change	-h28.8	-9.3	+15.2	+40.5	+30.4Source: Digest of Health StatisticsBut these numbers are only a superficial measure of work load.    The Joint EvidenceCommittee say that doctors&apos; work is more sophisticated than in the past and requireshigher intellectual qualities.    The intensity of work has also increased because theaverage length of a patient&apos;s stay in hospital has been reduced to make better useof the beds available; it has fallen (for non-psychiatric patients) from about 20days to about 14 in the last decade.   At any given time, therefore, alarger proportion of patients is likely to be in the immediate post-operativeperiod or, for other reasons^ in need of special care.    Further, there has   .been a disproportionate increase in the number of accident and emergency cases anda growing number of intensive-care units which throw an added burden on to hospital doctors.    It is also argued that consultants&apos; training responsibilitiestowards junior staff are increasing and that they are becoming more involvedin the work of hospital administration.    Some light is thrown on these matters by a survey conducted by the Regional Hospitals Consultants and Specialists Association.This indicated an average of 38 hours a week spent by whole-time consultants onclinical work and about 70 - 80 hours on emergency call.12
confidential the average number of hours spent on teaching (for whole-time and part-timeconsultants together) was 3 a week, and the average for committee work was 2 hours.Although we do not know how far the figures are representative of all consultants,the survey provides some useful information about the position at the present time.It does not show how it is changing.21. .     Evidence has also become available recently about the hours that doctorsin the training grades spend at work or on call.   Extra duty allowances (to compensate for the loss of minimum time off duty) which were introduced in 1970,have been running at a much higher rate than was expected. The survey carried2out by the Management Services Branch of the DHSS in 1968 showed that working hours averaged 38^   a week but duty hours including time &quot;on call&quot; were considerablylonger, averaging 883- and exceeding 120 hours in some instances.    It is notpossible to say, however, whether the situation is worse than it was some years ago..Because junior doctors have to combine the care of patients (which needs 24-hourcover and is an essential part of their training) with continuing study, often in pursuit of higher qualifications, it is unlikely that their working hours could bereduced to the same level as in other occupations, and we do not think they would expect such a reduction.   But the need for improvement in the hours and conditions is now recognised and we hope the necessary action will be taken as quickly aspossible.22.       The average number of patients on general medical practitioners&apos; listsincreased from 2,257 in 1961 to a peak of about 2,430 in 1968 and 1969 and has since fallen to 2,400 in 1971.    There may be more duplication of patients&apos;records in the later years, so that recent list sizes may in reality be slightly less than the figures show, but we do not think this could significantly affect theimpression that the figures give us of the general trend.   Here again, the numberof patients is an inadequate measure of the workload, which may well be affected toa greater extent by social changes and developments in medicine itself.    The health departments suggest that improvements in practice organisation have probablyreduced workload.    There has been a trend towards working in groups with purpose-built premises, with the help of ancillary staff and attached local authority staff.It is argued on the one hand that these changes have little effect on the totalworkload for a given number of patients but merely enable the doctor to spend more time with patients who need it, while practice nurses and attached staff persuade1   See paragraph 27 of our previous report, Cmnd 4825 ,2   Organisation of the Work of Junior Hospital Doctors.   HMS0 1971.13. .&apos;
CONFIDENTIALpeople to see their doctors who would not otherwise have done so.On the other hand, a report by the Royal College of general practitioners 5 Bays that the introduction of a trained nurse into general practice is associated with a gradual fall in consultation rates as the work ofthe nurse increases.   The report indicates that the introduction of appointment systems (which depend on the employment of ancillary staff) reducesconsultation rates.   It also draws attention to the saving of time whenconsultations take place in the surgery instead of at home, and shows tha-t,while the total number of consultations per patient does not seem to have changed significantly, an increasing proportion take place in the surgery.Further, group practice at least provides doctors with periods when they can rely on being free from their responsibilities.23.     The workload of dentists is, in a sense, easier to measure than the work-load of doctors, since dentists are paid for each item of service.   There hasbeen a marked increase in the amount of work done by each dentist.   The numberof &quot;full courses&quot; of treatment (ie treatment culminating in dental fitness as distinct from emergency treatment   for relief of pain) increased by over 7k percent (from 10.7 m to 18.7 m) in the decade 1959-1969* with an increase of only per cent in dental manpower.   This was no doubt helped by a tendency for patients to visit dentists more often, reducing the amount of treatment thathas to be given on each occasion.   The trend in treatment has moved away fromthe extraction of teeth and provision of dentures towards the conservation ofthe natural teeth,though it still has a long way to go.   In 1959 one treatmentcourse in 30 involved the initial provision of full dentures; in 1969 it was one in 83.   In the decade the cost of a full course of treatment fell by one-thirdat constant money values.24,   The target net income recommended by the Pilkington Royal Commission in1960 was based on the results of enquiries which showed that single-handeddentists (excluding those not working full-time) worked on average between 2,050and   2,200   hours a year.   It was expressed as being related to total annualworking hours of about this length,       and to the assumption that the balance between NHS work and private practice would not materially alter.   enquiries into working hours have since been made at intervals by the Dental Rates study group with the following resultss-X   Present State and Future Needs of General Practice (Second Edition).  Publish-ed    by    the Council of the Royal College of General Practitioners, May1970.14
CONFIDENTIALHours spent onycar Total hours general dental&quot; vorked service, work1961 2,085 1,9251963 2,120 1,9791967 2,000 1,863gc       The level.of response to recent questionnaires was disappointing, however, andthe Health Department have told us that statistical enquiries for other purposesraise doubts as to whether the number of hours worked in 1967 was as high as. the table shows.   We can conclude that dentists&apos; average working hours have not increased since the Pilkington Royal Commission made its enquiry and there has probably been some reduction, but it is impossible to say exactly how much.26,     It is clear, therefore, that an average dentist   is achieving much more in a workinghour than he achieved ten years ago.   Improvements in dental equipment such as&apos;theair rotor drill have undoubtedly contributed to this result and the increasing prop-proportion of young dentists, who are better able to maintain the physical effort thatdentistry requires, may also have helped.   But we think that some part of the increase-in output must be attributed to more intensive work and to improvements in methods andin practice organisation.27.  It will be apparent from what we have said in this chapter that in general we have little to go by except qualitative information and general impressions.   It is probablytrue of most professions that work tends to grow more complex and demanding with thepassage of time.   It is difficult to judge   from our present information whether this tendency is greater in medicine and dentistry than it is in other professions.28.    We referred in our 1971 report (paragraph 53) to our hope that more systematicinformation could be obtained with the co-operation of the professions and the health departments.   It will take a considerable time to obtain useful results, butdiscussions have begun and we hope it will be possible to put some studies in handwithout undue delay.15
CHAPTER 4CONFIDENTIALCOMPARISONS OF MOVEMENTS IN EARNINGS20.     We turn now to the question of long-term movements in the remuneration of doctors and dentists in comparison with other professions,   The PilkingtonRoyal Commission recommended levels of remuneration for MS doctors and dentists in the period 1960-62 and these were accepted by the professions andthe Government.   The Kindersley Review Body, which was set up to keep doctors&apos;and dentists&apos; remuneration under continuing review as recommended by the pilkington Commission, made a number of reports in the period 19o3-69 which led to increases in doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; remuneration.   In 1970 the review body came to the conclusion that the remuneration of doctors and dentists had fallen behind the remuneration of other professions, and recommended a general increase of 30 per cent for the period from April 1970 to March 1972 with theintention of restoring the position to what it had been at the time of the pilkington Report.30.    The Government of the day refused to accept this recommendation in fullwithout further advice from the National Board for Prices and Incomes.   As weexplained in our 1971 report, this refusal led to the resignation of the KindersleyReview Body and eventually to our own appointment.   It was made clear when wewere appointed that we should not regard ourselves as bound by comparisons withthe past.   Indeed, the Pilkington Commission itself said that doctors and dentistsshould not have a fixed place in a changing world; their financial position might rise in relation to some occupations and fall in relation to others and a standing review body should be free to decide what factors were relevant atany particular time and the weight to be attached to them.   We would add that because circumstances change, and pay relationships change with them, mosttrades and professions could single out a particular date in the past when theywere relatively better placed than they are now.   If such comparisons were generally admitted there would be an endless succession of leap-frogging pay claims.31,   Nevertheless, because of the chain of events that preceded our appointmentwe think it desirable to clarify the position as far as we can.   It appearsthat about half the increase of 30 per cent recommended in 1970 was intended tomake up the ground that doctors and dentists were thought to have lost in theperiod up to the Kindersley Review Body&apos;s previous general report, completed16
in December 1968.   The other half was intended to keep pace with the generalrise in earnings and prices that had occurred between January 1969 and thedate of the Twelfth Report, together with the further rise expected by april 1971. so as to ensure that doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; earnings would be &quot;right&quot;at the mid-point of the period (April 1970 to March 1972) to which the recommend-ation related.   Reservations have been expressed on behalf of the Government onthe question whether the data available to the Kindersley Review Body were adequate to support its assessment of the changes in relative levels of remunerative-ation that had occurred before 1969.   On the other hand representatives of themedical and dental professions, though unable to express a view on that point,have suggested to us that the Kindersley Review Body did not make enough allowance for inflation in the period from January I969 to April 1971, so that, assuming the review Body&apos;s judgement to be otherwise correct,a large increase would be needednow to restore past differentials.   We feel that if the matter were leftunresolved there might be a continuing- sense of injustice among- doctors and dentists and this is something we should do our best to avoid.32.     &apos;7e have accordingly made a study of the changes since the PilkingtonReport in doctors and dentists&apos; remuneration compared with the remuneration of other groups, using all the information we could obtain.   The results are set out in detail in Appendix II, but we summarise our main conclusions below.33,     In the first place we must explain that the Pilkington Commission basedits recommendationsupon extensive enquiries leading to much fuller informationthan had ever been available before about earnings in the medical, dental andother professions.   Its recommendations, which were accepted by the twoprofessions and by the Government, made changes not only in the levels of remuneration but also, to some extent, in its structure and in the relativitieswithin the professions.   They are therefore the earliest point at which a study of this kind can appropriately start.   The Commission was appointed in 1957 andits recommendations related to the period 1960-62, whereas the information about earnings that it obtained and published related mainly to the year 1955-56.Clearly, if comparisons are to be made with the relative standards of remun-eration set by the Pilkington Report, the starting point must be the period1960-62, to which the recommendations related, and not the year 1955-5&quot;* beforethe Commission was set up.   Unfortunately, because the comprehensive studiescarried out by the Pilkington Commission were not repeated, the information about remuneration in 1960-62 is not so full as the information available about1955-56*   We have therefore   included the period back to 1955-56 in ourenquiries although 1955-56 is not an appropriate starting date for comparisons with the levels of remuneration recommended in the Pilkington Report.    Westress this point because it might otherwise be a source of misunderstanding.
9CONFIDENTIAL34,   In making recommendations to cover the three years 1960-62, however, the commission had to make some allowance for inflation in this period.   Thus the levels of remunerative-ation it proposed were somewhat too high at the beginning of 1960, in the expectation-that they would be overtaken by inflation and would be somewhat too low by the end of1962,   the aim being that they should be right on average over the three years as awhole.   It is not certain how the allowance made for inflation in 1960-62 comparedwith the actual rises in comparative earnings, nor is it certain how correctly theCommission estimated the rises in comparative earnings between 1955-56 and January 196C.Because some under-estimation may have occurred, the base year for the index to compare with other occupations has been taken as the financial year 1960-61, instead of 1961which was the mid-year of the period.35,   In Appendix II comparisons are made between the financial years   1960-61 to 1971-72,because comparisons of earnings over periods of twelve months help to overcome the uncertainties caused by increases awarded at different times of the year.   In the table below, however, we compare the increases in doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; earnings with theincrease in the Salaries Index from 1960-61 to April 19711 because April 1971 was the mid-point of the period covered by the Twelfth Kindersley report, and it was our predecessors-successors&apos; aim to recommend levels of remuneration that would be right at the mid-pointof each review period.   1 April 1971 was also the beginning of the period covered by our own 1971 report.   The recommendations in that report, which were accepted by theGovernment, virtually restored the position in 1971-72 to what it would have been if therecommendations in the Twelfth Kindersley Report had been implemented in full.36.   It will be seen from the table below that between 1960-61 and April 1971? the mid-point of the period dealt with/the Twelfth Kindersley Report, there were increases of83 and 131 per cent in the average remuneration of hospital doctors and general medical practitioners respectively, and an increase of 94 per cent in the target average netremuneration of general dental practitioners.Percentage increases between 1960/61 and April 1971-   ,   .

Taking the professions together the average was 103 percent.   The increase in salaries generally was 102 per cent.
In eo far as comparisons with the Salaries. Index are appropriate, there-fore, doctors and dentists together have marginally improved upon the position they hadin 1960-61.   As a broad judgement we conclude that any underestimate of future inflation by the Kindersley Review Body was offset by an over-estimate ofthe extent to which doctors and dentists lost ground before I9691.37,   In drawing this conclusion we are, of course, dealing only with the average increase for the whole of the two professions, as the Kindersley Review Body didin the relevant part of the Twelfth Report.     Doctors have done relatively well,in a?l, because general medical practitioners (accounting for nearly half thetotal numbers in the profession) received a big percentage increase in remunerationin 1966-68 and house officers received above - average increases in 1966 and 1969*We do not   think it would necessarily be right, however, to conclude that equitynow requires a major increase in other doctors&apos; salaries.   The increase in general practitioners&apos; remuneration in 1966-68 was designed to make general practicerelatively more attractive; and it was also acknowledged that house officers were relatively underpaid.   Because the total increase in real incomes cannot, in thelong term, exceed the growth in the national product, a large increase for one section of the population must be at the expense of other sections.   It might be argued that the relative sacrifice should be borne by the population at large and not by other sections of the medical profession but in the light of the more detailed comparisons between doctors^ earnings and others, which we describebelow, we do not consider it necessary to pursue this question.The Twelfth Kindersley Report indicates (paragraph 82) that the main standardof comparison, for the period before 1969, was the increase of earnings inprofessions other than medicine and dentistry but &quot;remuneration in those professionswhere the statistics were particularly reliable had increased at rates ...slightly below the rate at which the &apos;average salary earnings1 index ..* roseduring the same period,&quot;19
confidential the Salaries Index is compiled mainly from information about the earnings ofworkers who are relatively low-paid in relation to doctors and dentists.    (Theaverage salary included in it was at a rate of  1,878 a year (for males)in OctoberI970J    Doctors&apos; earnings can also be compared with indices derived from InlandRevenue figures of earnings, so that the movement in the pay of each category ofdoctor and dentist is related to the movement of the incomes of workers at similarsalary levels.   This comparison is more illuminating than a comparison with the salaries Index because it takes account of the fact that in recent years higherincomes have not increased as fast, in percentage terms, as lower incomes; thiscompression obviously needs to be taken into account in determining doctors&apos; anddentists1 remuneration.   Information about the professions other than medicine anddentistry is not comprehensive and refers to a number of different years.   Ingeneral however it confirms the view expressed in the Twelfth Report of xheKindersley Review Body that earnings in the professions which have higher averageincomes than those in the Salaries Index have increased rather less fast.   -Summary of the position in April 197139*     The following table, derived from figures in Appendix II, shows that general medical practitioners and house officers did substantially better, up to April 1971,than other workers who had similar incomes to theirs in 196O-6I, while consultantsand doctors in the training grades lost some ground, but in no case more than 8per cent.   By this comparison also it is clear that the medical profession, taken as a whole, gained ground rather than lost it in relation to other workers in theperiod between the Pilkington Report and April 1971.MOVEMENTS IN doctors AND DENTISTS&apos; EARNINGS COMPARED WITH CORRESPONDING PER-CENTILES AT APRIL 1971(INDICES : I960/6I = 100)	Earnings	Corresponding per-centile April 1971		Shortfall (-) or excess (+J of	April 1971 (a)	Percentlie	Index (*)	earnings relative to percentile = (a) -(b) as percentage of (a)n         jj--       (minimum) House officer )     .

In interpreting the above figures it must be remembered that the percentages ofshortfall or excess are differences between two much larger figures and aretherefore sensitive to quite small alterations in either.   A difference inchoice of index date could alter the figures tabulated quite considerably; inparticular the smaller shortfalls and excesses shown both above and belowprobably lie close to the limits of error involved in calculations of thiskind.Summary of the position in April 1972.40.

41.     If a shorter period is considered the position appears even more favourable.Between April 1967 (the mid-point of the period covered by the Kindersley review body&apos;s Seventh Report and the date from which the recommendations were implemented in full) and April 1971,doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; remuneration increased generallyby 40 per cent; house officers&apos; remuneration exceptionally increased by 48 per cent.The graphs in Appendix II show that, at levels of pay corresponding to those of doctors and dentists,average salaries increased in the same period by amountsranging from 31 to 36 per cent.    The Seventh Report, like the Pilkington Report,recommended major changes in the structure of remuneration and in the relativitiesbetween groups, and the Kindersley Review Body said &quot;... though we have carefully considered the evidence available to us on comparisons (with other incomes)we have not felt able to rely on it as a decisive or even as a primary factor informing our views... Our aim throughout has been to try to decide what levels of remuneration are appropriate for all the circumstances of the period to which, 2our review relates&quot;.        Although the Kindersley Review Body in its Twelfth Reportreconsidered the position in the light of new evidence on comparative remunerationthere is a case for saying that comparisons with the past, so far as they are validat all, should not extend back before 1967.    Once a pay settlement has been acceptedby the parties concerned, as the Seventh Report was, the usual presumption in pay negotiations is that the chapter is closed.    If happenings that took place before asettlement were generally allowed to influence future settlements it is difficultto see how any stability in pay could be attained.42.      So far we have considered salary scales or the average earnings of broadgroups without regard to the possible effects of changing age distributions.We consider that comparisons on this basis are valid for doctors: the average ageof promotion to consultant, which is the principal step in the salary progressionof hospital doctors, has not changed materially since the Pilkington report, andalthough the average age of general practitioners has increased it has not changedenough to affect our general conclusions.    For general dental practitioners the case is different because there has been a significant increase in the proportion ofyounger dentists, and dentists&apos; earnings tend to diminish as they approach the ageof retirement.    Consequently comparisons over time, based on the average earnings of all dentists, do not give a fair picture of changes in the earnings of olderdentists.    The table in paragraph     39 shows that on average dentists&apos; targetearnings have barely kept pace with the earnings of other groups who were at asimilar income level in 1960-61._______________________.____________&quot;Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration.   Seventh Report, (Cmnd 2992 -May I966 paragraph 253)*   The Government decided to phase the introductionof the increases recommended.   Their full introduction was also delayed, in common with the introduction of increases for other groups, by the prices and incomes standstill of July I966.22
confidential the earnings of older dentists must therefore have tended to fall behind.We have made clear that it would be wrong for us to follow the relativitiesset by the Pilkington Report, regardless of other considerations, but therelative fall may have produced a level of remuneration that is now too low and this is one factor to be taken into account with others in our pre-sent recommendations.43.    Taking the medical and dental professions together, we think the factsset out in this chapter show that the levels of remuneration, as they were inApril 19711 following the recommendations in our 1971 Report, were not open to challenge on the grounds that they were too low in relation to the pastrelativities set out above; though that is not to pre-judge whether those pastlevels were right in some absolute sense.   What we have established is that insofar as past levels were ever judgedto have been right, the overall levels at April1971 and those we recommend for April 1972   could be regarded as at leastequally so.   Now that we have considered this matter in full,we do not thinkit necessary to look back beyond April 1971.44*     As we have already said, we shall not attempt to allow for futureinflation in our recommendations.   In the following chapters we recommendlevels of remuneration to apply from April 1972 and we have endeavoured toarrive at levels that are fair at that date.   Among the circumstances we havekept in mind are the rise in prices^ and the information we have been able toobtain about the increases in other incomes at comparable levels between April1971 and April 1972; together with the Governments policy of seeking to reducethe rate of increase of money incomes in the national interest.^The Association of Scientific Technical and Managerial Staffs claimed an increase ofat least 14.3 per cent in the salaries of junior hospital doctors on the grounds that prices had increased by this percentage since their salaries were lastfixed in April 1970.   We stated in our 1971 report, however, that our predecessors&apos; aim was to fix salaries at a level that would be right at the mid-point of the period under review - in this case, April 1971 - hut we are notfollowing this practice.    The relevant period so far as price increases areconcerned is therefore April 1971 - April 1972.   In this period the Retail price index rose by about 6.3 per cent,   though from March to March the increase was.6 per cent.23
CONFIDENTIALWe have come to the conclusion that there should he a general increase in remuneration of 7&quot;g- per cent with somewhat larger increases for certaingroups to take account of their special circumstances.   The effect ofthese is to produce an overall increase of 8 per cent in net remuneration for the medical and dental professions as a whole.45*     In a wider context it is our aim to do justice between the nation,as the employer of NHS doctors and dentists, and the doctors and dentiststhemselves, remembering that the latter have committed themselves to theirprofessions by long training and have no way of finding alternative employ-ment except by emigration.   The evidence we have reviewed in this chapterand the two that precede it does not suggest to us that the balance is sofar wrong that any large change in the level of remuneration is needed to correct it.   We shall continue to keep these matters under review and ifwe conclude in future that the remuneration of any group of doctors or den-tists is either too high or too low, in its relationship to other groups inthese professions or to earnings in other occupations we shall try to makeadjustments in good time, and if necessary by gradual stages, so as to avoid the risk of hardship on the one hand and on the other hand to minimise thepossible repercussions on other earnings.24
HOSPITAL DOCTORS AND DENTISTSSalaries of the training grades46.     Evidence given to us on behalf of the training grades has emphasised the heavy workload they carry, and the shortages of staff that exist insome specialties and in some parts of the country.   It has also drawn our attention to the poor standard of residential accommodation in some hospitals and to the fact that junior doctors have to compete for a succession of posts in different hospitals, so that they inay be unemployed for periodsbetween appointments.   The evidence also stressed particularly the factthat the average age of promotion to consultant is over 37, ^d that beforepromotion doctors in the training grades earn much less than their colleagues who go into the medical branches of the Armed Forces or intogeneral practice.   It is suggested that the relativities between the traininggrades1 salaries and the earnings of general practitioners should be restored to what they were in 1960-61, before the general increase which hasbeen requested for the whole profession is applied.47.     Studies have shown that junior hospital doctors and dentists have longand sometimes excessive hours on duty.   We have no evidence that the situationis worse than it was in the past but now that factual information is availablewe expect urgent steps to be taken to deal with thematter.   We do not consider that a pay increase is an appropriate compensationfor excessive hours or other conditions that can be dealt with by administrativemeans.   On the one hand, it is difficult to revert to the previous positionafter the conditions have been improved; on the other hand there is a risk ofthe additional pay becoming a permanent feature of the salary structure and being held to justify the continuance of bad conditions.   The only satis-factory way to deal with bad conditions is to take steps to end them.   In
the meanwhile junior doctors have some compensation in the form of extraduty allowances for the loss of minimum time off; the need to pay theseallowances puts pressure on hospital authorities to make the necessary changesin their staffing.48.    The military salaries of doctors in the Armed Forces are determined by comparison with the earnings of civilian general practitioners; we do not feel,therefore, that evidence about them adds anything to the comparison that hasbeen made with the earnings of civilian general practitioners themselves.   It istrae that these general practitioners can often attainrelatively high earnings when they are still young.   But, leaving aside the increases that are awarded to all doctors, they cannot expect any great increase in earnings as they grow older.   As the figures in Appendix II show,general practitioners aged 55-60 earn little more, on average, than those aged30-35*   Doctors who have decided to stay in the hospital service   in the expectation of obtaining appointments as consultants usually earn less thangeneral practitioners until they secure such appointments; thereafter their salaries improve and on average, especially when income from private practice and distinction awards is taken into account, their earnings considerablysurpass those of general practitioners.   The evidence from the training gradesdoes not appear to take full account of these facts.   We have been shownfigures comparing the earnings of hospital doctors and general practitionerson the basis that the latter can earn over  6,550 annually from the age of 31onwards.    If this is supposed to be an average then the argument isbasefl on a misconception.   The figures are derived from advertisementsinviting young doctors to join partnerships and indicating the earnings theycan expect when they attain an equal share in the partnership earnings.   Butgeneral practitioners have to find considerable sums (currently averaging morethan  2,000 a year) out of their gross income to meet practice expenses.   Thefigures quoted in the advertisements are normally of net income, in the   sense that the expenses which are met by the partnership as a whole have beendeducted; but each individual member would normally have substantial further26
CONFIDENTIALexpenses.   The recommendations in our 1971 report were intended to produce average net earnings from fees and allowances of  5.185 a year for all general practitioners.Although this may have been slightly exceeded, the provisional figures we have had fromthe Health Departments for the amounts paid out by executive councils  in 1971-72indicate that any excess was relatively small.   A sum of the order of  400 to  500might be added for earnings from other sources, but even when this has been done thefigure of  6,550 exceeds the average net earnings of young general practitioners byabout  1,000 a year.49,      We have devoted some space to this question because of the misunderstandingsthat seem to be widespread.   When these have been removed it is, of course, true thatthere is a considerable disparity between the amount a doctor can expect to earn ataround the age of 30 if he goes into general practice, and the amount he can expect to earn if he stays in the hospital service.   This is due largely to the majorincrease in general practitioners1 income that was recommended in the Seventh Reportof the Kindersley Review Body and came fully into effect in April 1967-   The intention was to increase the relative attraction of general practice : a step which was consider-ed necessary at the time because of the fall in the number of general practition-ersand the rise in average list size.   There has been some improvement in the positionbut, as we show in the next chapter, there are no grounds for complacency.   V/e cannot therefore accept that there is a good case for restoring the previous relativitiesbetween general practitioners and the training grades in the hospital service.50.   We believe,however,that there is a case for some relative improvement in the pay ofthe training grades (above house officer), particularly in that of senior registrarsat the upper end of their incremental scale.   Senior registrars in general have taken the decision to stay in the hospital service rather than go into general practice, but may be faced with a long wait for a consultant appointment.   This is a situation that can be expected to improve, since it has been agreed between the Health departments and the BMA that the consultant grade will be expanded more rapidly than the juniorgrades, so that the average age of promotion will tend to fall.   But this will take time.   We think that an improvement in relative pay is needed now to recognise the
M CONFIDENTIALresponsibility that senior registrars have;   we hope it would also help to continuethe reduction in the incidence of emigration.   Cur recommendations are in Appendix iii and we propose that these scales should apply from 1 April 1972.Consultants51. Our recommendations about the training grades will reduce the  differentials betweenthem and consultants;   this is the only point at which the present salary structurehas room for making the amount of change that seems   to us to be necessary.   Thereduction may affect the attraction for senior registrars of appointments as &quot;maximumpart time&quot; consultants who are paid at nine elevenths of the full rate.   But the choice between a maximum part time and a whole-time appointment is at the senior registrar&apos;soption and vie have been told that, in any case, a new form of hospital contract forconsultants has been proposed by the profession.   Negotiations with the health i  Departments are expected to begin shortly, and may result in far-reaching changes inthe system of remuneration.   If they go reasonably quickly we may expect to be asked,within the next twelve months, to recommend the rates of remuneration to be attachedto the new system in the period beginning 1 April 1973*   In the circumstances itwould not be appropriate to consider any structural changes in the salary scale atpresent;   our recommendations for the salaries to apply from April 1972 are inAppendix III.Administrative medical officers52. The Kindersley Review Body concluded in its Twelfth Report, in -;he light of evidence from the profession, that there was &quot;an urgent need to reorganise this small but important section of the service&quot;,   and urged the profession and the Health Depart-ments to agree on the appropriate structure.   Thereafter, the Review Body would beprepared to recommend rates of pay without delay, and in advance of its next general review.   Meanwhile, it recommended increases broadly comparable to those recommended for the clinical grades.28
CONFIDENTIAL55,   Medical administrators were treated in the same way as the clinical grades in the ensuing months.   The training grade   received  in full the increases recommended by the Kindersley Review Body, and the non-training grades receiveonly a proportion of the recommended increases.   But the Government offered tore-open discussions with the professions on changes in the pay structure   of themedical administrators, as a result of which a revised staffing structure and salary scales were introduced with effect from 1 September 1970.   The formergrade of deputy SAMO was abolished, and in each region one PASMO was to be designated to deputise for the SAMO, and a deputising allowance of  250 a year was to be payable.   The medical officer grade was envisaged as the training grade,with a new salary scale equivalent to that of senior registrar.54.   These increased salaries and other changes were accepted by the profession,though the Joint Evidence Committee told us that this was in anticipation of afurther examination in the next major review, as no review body was in existenceat the time.   The following table compares the maximum salaries of administrativemadical officers in I969 with those introduced in September 1970 and with theincreased salaries for the senior grades that were introduced following our 1971report.Administrative medical officersMaxima of salary scalesSeptember      April1970 1971   8,130 8,7845,718        6,0485,115 5,4093,588 3,588SAMO  b   Senior administrative medical officerPASMO b   Principal assistant senior medical officerFor SAMOs and PASMOs the salary scales differ according to region.

CONFIDENTIAL55.   The professions recognise that considerable progress has been made in improving the salary of administrative medical officers, and equating their statusmore closely to that of clinicians of comparable seniority.   Nevertheless, theyconsider that improvements are still necessary, and that in particular themaximum salary 01 the PASMO grade should be equated with the maximum salary ofthe consultants scale.   Further, they consider that the deputising allowance should be increased.   They have stressed that an increasingly heavy load of workand responsibility is being carried by administrative medical officers in an atmosphere of change, in which every major decision must be made with regard tothe future reorganisation of the NHS.   The Government&apos;s proposals for the new structure emphasise the importance of good management and in the professions view it is clear that much will depend on the availability of experienced and ablemedical administrators at regional and area levels.   Moreover it is pointed outthat there is still a shortage of medical administrators.56.   We recognise the importance of the part medical administrators will play in the forthcoming reorganisation of the NHS, but we do not feel that aconvincing case has been made out for a further increase in their remunerationrelative to that of clinicians.   As the table shows, they have received a very big increase in the last two years, and we see no reason at present for disturbingthe relationship with the clinical grades that was negotiated (albeit in theabsence of a review body) in September 1Q70*   Our recommendations on this occasionare therefore designed to maintain the present relationship. Their scales are set out in Appendix III.Salaries of other career grades57*    The Joint Evidence Committee has represented to/us that there is a case for changes in the structure of some of these scales.   Y/e do not&apos;feel able, however,to consider the question at the present time because of the prospect of changes inthe structure of remuneration for both consultants and training grades which wewould wish to take into account.   We therefore recommend that these salary scales(and the allowances of senior hospital medical officers) should be increased bythe same percentage as has been applied to the consultants scale.
Distinction awards58.    In our 1971 report we recommended an increase in the number of distinctionawards (which are granted to consultants recommended for awards by an independentadvisory committee under the chairmanship of Sir Hector HacLennan) and an increasein the value of each award, of the same percentage as that which we had recommended for the maximum of the consultant salary scale.   We have consulted Sir iiectorLlacLennan, and had the benefit of his views as to the maximum number of awardsthat should be available in 1972-73.   We have also to take account of the factthat the BMA is holding a referendum to ascertain whether changes in the presentsystem are generally desired; and on the possibility of changes in the structure of consultants&apos; remuneration, to which we have referred above.   In the circumstances,although Sir Hector MacLennan has suggested that there should be some increase inthe relative number   of &quot;C&quot; awards, we have decided that we should limit our recommendation on this occasion to the increase in the number of awards that is needed to preserve the present ratio of award-holders to the total.   The value ofeach award should be increased, as in previous years, in the same ratio as themaximum, of the consultants&apos; scale.   Our recommendations are given in detail in Appendix IT.Domiciliary consultations by consultants59*   Whole-time consultants are expected to carry out a number of domiciliaryvisits (at present four in each calendar quarter) without additional remuneration.For visits beyond four in each quarter there is a fee which now stands at  6.60,an increase - as the Joint Evidence Committee has pointed out - of only 57 per centsince the fee was first fixed at  4.20 in 1948.   Given the possibility of changesin conditions of service, which may affect the circumstances in which fees are paid, we do not feel able to review this matter in/any detail at present; but werecommend that the fee should be increased to  7.50.Fees for lectures60. The fee for a post-graduate lecture is ,at present  6, and for a generallecture (eg to nurses) it varies from  2.60 to  4.20, depending on the grade ofthe lecturer.   It has been represented to us that these fees are much below those
1We do not think,however, that the task of lecturing to colleagues should necessarily be expectedto attract a fee of the same order as would be paid for a lecture to an outsideaudience; indeed, before recommending any major change   in the level or&quot; foes, wewould wish to consider in more detail the circumstances in which they -;re anprop-riate.   Pending further review, we recommend that the fees should be increa ed asset out in Appendix   IV.Mileage   allowance for part-time consultants61.   Part-time consultants making journeys by car away from their main hospitalsreceive a mileage allowance   for the return journey between their homes orconsulting rooms, the hospital and the place visited.   The mileage is calculatedfrom home or consulting room, according to which is nearer to the hospital.   Ithas been represented to us that this operates unfairly for part-time consultantswho have consulting rooms near the hospitals where they work.   It prevents them,except when called out in an emergency, from receiving mileage allowance calcu-lated from their homes, although they may use thar consulting rooms only rarely,and indeed may not visit them at all on the days when they are entitled to claim the allowance.   The Joint Evidence Committee has asked us to make a recommendationbecause discussions between the BMA and the DH33 have not led to agreement.   we feel,however, that the question (which is one of procedure rather than remuneration)5is outside our competence.     It would need to be considered in relation to therules which are applicable to other categories of NHS employees and public servants generally.   We can only suggest that the two parties should discuss it again. &apos; fThe Joint Evidence Committee said that in paragraph 210 of their report the pilkington Commission indicated that the arrangement would be &quot;subject to review in due course by the Review Body&apos;.   We are not bound by thisparagraph or, as the Government has made clear to us, by the PilkingtonReport as a whole, but we have considered it.   It seems to us that thepassage quoted refers to the question of whether part-time consultantsshould receive travelling expenses at all, not to the particular rule inquestion which the Pilkington Commission apparently accepted.32
GENERAL MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS62.   The large increase in 1966-68 in the remuneration of general medical-practitioners, to which we have referred earlier, was one of the measuresintended to meet the mounting dissatisfaction in the general medical services which was leading to a decline in the total number of general medical practitioners, and indeed to a threat of mass resignations from the NHS.   Theincrease in the amount of remuneration was accompanied by changes in the structure intended to relate pay more closely to workload.   By 1968 the fallin the numbers of general practitioners had been arrested, and a gradualincrease had begun; though because of the growth of population,list sizescontinued to rise until 1970, as the following table shows.Number of general medical practitionersin NHS (Great Britain)(at 1 October in each year)Year	Number of unrestricted	Average list size	principals	1961	22,820	2,2571962	22,979	.    2,2671963	22,988	2,2901964	22,887	2,3201965	22,624	2,3681966	22,404	2,4071967	22,418	2,4251968	22,529	2,4301969	22,727	2,4311970	22,961	2,4131971	23,252	2,40033
CONFIDENTIAL63. To this extent,the position is encouraging, but the Joint Evidence Cor.vi* 1-.ehas argued that the crisis in general practice is by no means over.   the diminution in the proportion of doctors under 40, who will be needed to sustain general practice in the next two or three decades, has continued,though at a slower rate.   Moreover, many of the new entrants into general practice were born overseas, and it is not possible to feel confident that,the inflow of doctors from overseas will always continue at its recent level.Further, increasing numbers of the British-born doctors who go into general practice are women.   Because women generally withdraw from full-time work,for a time at least, when they are bringing up their families, the averagewoman&apos;s contribution to the service in terms of working years is less thana man&apos;s.   The profession and the Health Departments are at present consid-ering how women&apos;s contribution to general practice (as also to the hospital service) can be facilitated, and we hope that these discussions will leadto arrangements that will enable women to make the fullest practicable useof their medical training.   But it must be recognised that family responsi-bilities will always be there, and that it would be misleading to lookonly at the total number of doctors in practice without regard to changesin the ratio of merit0 women.64*    We agree therefore that the general situation, though improvingto some extent, is still far from satisfactory, and we shall need tokeep it under careful review.   This will be all the more necessary becauseof the improvements we have recommended in the pay of junior hospital doctors, which may have the effect of encouraging a larger proportion to remainin the hospital service, rather than leave it to enter general practice.   Wedo not consider, however, that any exceptional measures are needed at thepresent time.   The relative improvement in the remuneration of general practitioners in 1966-68 may not yet have produced its full effect,given the long time that doctors spend in34
training, and there are other tendencies, such as the trend to group practice,which might also have the effect of improving the relative attraction of ageneral practitioners career.&quot;5*   We turn, therefore, to the individual fees and allowances which make upgeneral practitioners&apos; gross remuneration.   We said in our 1971 report thatwe proposed to ask the profession and the Health Departments for their iews about the relative levels of the different items, with the object of takingthese into account in our present report.   It appears from the evidence we have had that in general the Departments and the profession are satisfiedthat the balance between the different items is about right; but there arecertain items, mostly small in relation to the total value of remuneration, inwhich   a    change is considered desirable, and we deal with these in the paragraphs that follow.The fees and allowances which are not mentioned specifically here are those which theDepartments and the profession consider to be broadly right in their relation-ship to others, and in our recommendations - which are set out in detail inAppendix IV - we have sought to restore the relationship to what it was before our 1971 report, in which, for reasons of convenience that we explained at thetime, we concentrated the increase we then recommended upon a limited numberof items,66.   We deal first vith two items, temporary resident fees and the vocational training allowance , upon which the profession and the Departments are agreedthat changes are necessary.Temporary resident fees *67.   The Health Departments and the professions representatives explained to us in a joint statement that they had agreed to changes in the form of the35
36arrangements for paying doctors   who treated patients temporarily resident intheir areas.   A person who goes to live in another area for up to three month(for example when going on holiday or to do temporary work   away from home) neednot be removed from his own doctor&apos;s list.   If he needs treatment he can applyto a doctor in the area where he is living temporarily and the latter receivesa fee (at present , 1.42^) for providing it.   The fee is paid at half-rate, however,to doctors who attend regularly at places such as holiday camps or convalescenthomes where there are 10 or more temporary residents.   This latter provision isdifficult to administer in a consistent way and in any case it is felt that the half-rate fee is not enough to encourage good arrangements for proper treatment.The Health Departments and the profession proposed to replace theexisting arrangements by new ones in which there would be two levels of fee: a lower level for temporary residents who did not expect to remain in the area for more than 15 days after the time when treatment was first given; and a higher rate for those who expected to remain more than 15 days (up to 3 months).   the health Departments and the profession gave us their views separately as to whatthe proper amount of the fees would be under this new arrangement.
3768. The Joint Evidence Committee proposed that new fees should be  I.50 and 2.25 for 15 day and 3 months1 temporary residents respectively.   The health departments did not propose specific figures, though they agreed with the profession that the fee for 15 day residents could not well be below thepresent figure ( 1.42^) for temporary residents.   We accept the professionsview that under the new arrangements the 15 day fee should be.set at  I.50.There is no evidence at present which would enable us to judge how the feefor 3 months1 residents should be related to this; it will in any case forma very small element in the remuneration of medical practitioners in general,and we do not expect it to figure very largely in the remuneration of any individual practitioner.   We see no reason to   suppose that the professionsassessment of the proper amount of this fee is unreasonable, and we therefore recommend that it shouldjinitially be set at a level of  2.25.   We shall review the level of both fees in future reports, in the light of evidence as to thenumber of payments made; we hope that the Departments and the profession willalso be able to give us some information about the number of practitioners for whom these fees are an important item, and how far the fees can be regarded asproper compensation for the additional workload that temporary residentsrepresent.Vocational training allowance69.   Here again we have received a joint statement from the Health departments and the profession, explaining the present position and the reasons why changes are considered necessary, and we reproduce it below
The scheme of remuneration provides for doctors who undertake approved courses of vocational training before entering general practice as principals to receive aspecial vocational training allowance (currently  175 per annum) from the date whenthey become principals until they first   become entitled to the seniority allowance.Mie vocational training allowance then    ceases.    The approved period of training is; rears, consisting of an aggregate of 2 years in suitable hospital posts and an aggregate of one year in general practice.    Individual arrangements vary within this general frame&apos;.During the year the doctor undergoing training is working in general practicehe is under the tutelage of a principal, who acts a;; trainer.    The trainee receivesfrom the Executive Council, through the trainer, an allowance related to the salarywhich he (the trainee) would receive in an appropriate training grade in hospital.The principal also receives reimbursement for certain expenses - eg an allowance ofL295 when an extra car is provided for the trainee, and a grant of  240 specificallyin recognition of his work as a trainer.The Departments and the profession consider that the basic medical educationwhich entitles a doctor to registration on the Medical Register is not sufficientpreparation for general practice, and that it is of paramount importance that thegreatest possible number of general practitioners should be vocationally trained.A person who is a registered medical practitioner has however a right (subject tothe Medical Practices Committee&apos;s agreement to the location of his practice) to-go on the list of an Executive Council without undergoing vocational training;and the Departments and the profession regard it as urgent that there should be asubstantial increase in the incentives to undertake vocational training forgeneral practice, so that it can become accepted as the rule rather than theexception.    The financial provisions mentioned in paras 19 - 20 are incentives todoctors to undertake and to provide vocational training, but have proved inadequate.Between 1 October 1966 and 1 October 1970 there have never been more than 300principals in receipt of the vocational training allowance at any time out ofmore than 5,000 principals under 40 years of age.    The number in receipt ofthe allowance at any time represents of course the intake of trained practi-practitioners over a number of years.    The main reason for the ineffectiveness of the allowance at its present level is that entry into training entails a loss of remuneration to the practitioner because his salary during the 3years training will only be between  2,184 and  2,760 a year compared with the very much higher figure he would have been able to obtain as an assistant or a principal.The loss over the 3 years   may well be of the order of  5,000 -  6,000; the gain from 11 years&apos; payment of the vocational training allowance amounts to only 1 925
It seems clear that if more doctors are to be persuaded to undertakevocational training the amount of the vocational training allowance must be considerably increased.    Moreover, if more doctors are to undertake training, moredoctors will have to come forward to provide it, and it will be necessary torecognise more adequately than at present the responsibility the job involves.The trainer is doing a. specifically educational task in addition to working ingeneral practice.    Moreover, the time spent on educational work will reduce thetime available for practice; and if this necessitates a reduction in workload,there will be a consequential reduction in income from general medical services.The trainer is also likely to incur some extra incidental expenses (apart fromcar expenses, the allowance for which will continue to be separately payable).The Health Departments and the profession will be submitting separatelytheir views as to the desirable new levels of the vocational training allowance and the trainer&apos;s grant.    As regards timing, it is relevant that new arrangements will have to be made for the selection of trainers and this will take a littlewhile.    Both sides agree that these new arrangements should be on a regionalbasis and that they should be brought into effect as soon as possible,certainly not later than the beginning of the academic year 1973/74.    On thebasis of this understanding, it is agreed that, both for the trainer&apos;s grant and for the vocational training allowance, any new rates can come into effect asfrom 1 April 1972.&quot;70.     The Departments proposed that the vocational training allowance should be 400 a year, and the profession proposed  410.   Both parties considered that itshould continue at the figure they proposed until the first seniority allowancebecame payable, and should then be reduced by the amount of that allowance (whichis at present  260 a year).   It should cease when the second seniority allowancebecame payable.71.     The Departments proposed that the trainer&apos;s grant should be  850 a year;the profession proposed  1,040 (at the 1971-72 rates).   The Departments told us that in view of the paramount importance of vocational training for general practice they intended to work for the ultimate introduction of arrangements
under v/hich executive council lists r/ould be closed to new principals unless they were vocationally trained (perhaps with some exceptions)and that the rro-fession v/as aware of their intention.12.     It is obviously of very great importance that doctors going into general practice should, first have adequate   training and we have noted that theDepartments and the profession are agreed that the basic medical educationVihich entitles a doctor to registration on the Medical Register is not sufficientpreparation for general practice.   It would seen at first sight that if doctorsare going into general practice without adequate training the remedy is to pre-vent then from doing so; but we appreciate that it might not be desirable to erect a new barrier against entry into general practice until the vocational training scheme is firmly established and the number of doctors entering general practice is at a more satisfactory level.   The proposal made by the Departments andthe profession involves a substantial increase in the allowance for vocational training in the hope that a scheme which so farhas not proved popular (to judgeby the fact that the entry into vocational training at present is about $0doctors a year), will attract more recruits if it is more highly priced.   to the moment the cost of increasing the allowance would be almost negligible becauseso few doctors are entitled to it.   But if the revised scheme is a success the costs will mount from year to year and there is a possibility of side effectso:a which we have closely, questioned the representatives of the departments and the profession.73.    - In the first place, an additional payment to young general practitioners mightbe resented by junior hospital doctors who already feel, as we have mentionedearlier in this report, that the pay differential is unduly large.   They might also take the view that it is inequitable for a general practitioner to be paid,extra for being properly trained.   These objections carry little force if the extrapayment is contained within the total of the animal increases we recommend infuture for the general medical service.40
If this course is followed, however, the scheme night arouse some hostilityamong the older general practitioners since it would, in effect, be funded attheir expense.   Clearly, we should need to consider this matter carefully butit would be open to us to meet the objection, to some extent at any r be, by increasing -seniority allowances and making relatively smaller increases incapitation fees and practice allowances in future reviews.   The net effect would be a permanent,but probably not very large,alteration in the relation-ship between the different elements in general practitioners&apos; remuneration.&apos;   vJ t&apos;.7e must note that if the scheme is successful, it will cause a temporary reduc-tion in the number of doctors entering general practice as principals cor-responding to. the increase in the numbers undertaking vocational training.The Departments and the profession are ready to accept this to get the schemelaunched.Because of the importance which is attached to the scheme we agree that the allowance and the trainer&apos;s grant should be increased on the lines proposedby the Departments.We recommend, therefore, that the vocational training allowance should beincreased to  400 a year and. the&apos;trainer1s grant to  850.   The vocational training allowance should be reduced by the amount of the first seniorityallowance when the latter becomes payable.   In effect, general practitionerswould not be entitled to receive both the vocational training allowance and theseniority allowance but would get whichever was most favourable to them.   The .Departments should make arrangements,to ensure that general practitioners whoformerly received the vocational training.allowance but lost it when they becameentitled to the first seniority allowance, should have the benefit of thisarrangement,based on the level of the new vocational training allowance, from1 April 1972.41
Itemised service fees77.      The Joint Evidence Committee have represented to us that one of the mostimportant objects of the new system of remuneration, introduced inl966, wasto secure a more direct and realistic relationship between pay and the workloadand responsibility it was intended to recognise.   However, the actual s -stern wasa compromise;   the number of items of service which qualify for direct paymentis limited, and the fees themselves were, and still are, modest, so that they make up a very small proportion of total remuneration from executive councilsources.   The Committee say that it is the wish of general medical practitionersto expand this section of their system of remuneration, but this would involve further discussion with the Health Departments.   However, they have drawn our attention to a number of fees which are already paid, and which they consider tobe too small:   these are the fees for services carried out in pursuance of public policy, fees for emergency treatment, and fees for the arrest of dentalhaemorrhage.   We deal with them in turn and in general accept the case for anincrease.Public policy fees78.      These are two-fold:    fees for vaccination and immunisation and fees forcervical cytological examination.   These services are preventative rather thancurative and the fees, though&apos; not intended tonspresent full remuneration for thework involved, or full repayment of expenses in connection with it, are intendedto encourage the provision of the services as a matter of public policy.   It istherefore very difficult to judge what the proper amount should be, but we recognise the feeling of the profession that the present levels are too low.We recommend that the fees for vaccination and immunisation should be increased from 30p and 45p to 50p and 75p, and that the fee for cervical cytologicalexamination should be raised from 95p to  1.50*42
Emergency treatment fee79,   This fee is paid when a doctor is called in emergency to treat a patientwho is not on his list, and not eligible to be treated as a temporary resident;for example, someone who has collapsed in the street.   This is often time-consuming, may involve dealing with a serious illness and the need to arrangeadmission to hospital;    and by virtue of its emergency nature it disrupts thework of the doctor in attending to his own patients.   The present fee is 95p.We do not think this is enough, and recommend an increase to  3.   The otherfees in this group - for minor operations, treatments of fractures or dislocation-tions, etc. which at present stand at  1.40 - should also be raised to  3.The fee   for the administration of anaesthetics, at present  3.30, should beraised to  5.80.      The Joint Evidence Committee have told us that the regulations provide thata practitioner who provides services occupying an abnormal amount of time mayrepresent to the executive council that the Secretary of State shall beasked to authorise a special and larger fee;   in a few cases, the Committee say,the Health Department has not authorised a fee which was considered to becommensurate with the time taken;   we have been asked to recommend provision fora considerably greater fee if necessary, when either abnormal services orabnormal amounts of time are involved - up to a maximum of   say  10 for a major incident   involving attendance of an hour or more.   We do not consider,however, that we can cover special and abnormal circumstances by general recommendations.   The big increases in emergency treatment fees that we have recommended should go some way to meet the problem;   for the rest it seems tous to involve questions that must be decided by the Health Departments, in thelight of the particular circumstances involved on each occasion.43
Dental haemorrhage fee81,  Pees for the arrest of dental haemorrhage were introduced because whilethe basic responsibility for the treatment of this condition would normallyrest with the dental surgeon, there are occasions - for example, at night and at weekends - when the patient may not be able to get in touch with the dental surgeon, who is not under contract to provide out-of-hours and weekendservices.   The fee is 70p in the daytime, and  1.15 for a visit requested and made between the hours of midnight and 7 am-   In the circumstances in which itis paid it has much in common with the emergency treatment fee, but a somewhatlower level can be justified in the day-time sincethe patient concerned is on the doctor&apos;s own list.   We recommend that the newlevels of fee should be  2 and  3; but in parallel with the suggestion we make below about a change in the arrangements for night visit fees,we suggestthat the higher rate should operate from 11 pm instead of midnight.Supplementary capitation fees82.   These fees are one of the elements in remuneration which are designed to compensate general practitioners for their obligation to provide treatment topatients on their list when necessary at night and at weekends.   There are three such elements: a supplementary practice allowance, payable in respect ofall patients, on a sliding scale up to  296 a year for 1,000 patients; a supplementary capitation fee of 21p for each patient in excess of 1,000 on thepractitioner&apos;s list (or the average list in a partnership); and an item ofservice fee - the night visit fee, which is payable for a visit requested and made between midnight and 7 am   ( 2.50).   The Joint Evidence Committee considerthat these fees ought desirably to form a  higher proportion of total remunerationthan they do at present, and have proposed an increase of the order of one thirdto a half - ie to 28p to 32p - in the supplementary capitation fee,44
83.    At present, all doctors (with some small relaxation for those who areaged or infirm) have a 24-hour responsibility for their patients, and receivethe practice allowances and capitation fees for both daytime and out-of-hoursresponsibilities.   They can, of course, provide for time off by arrangementsamong themselves, or by employing a deputising service, but the responsibilityremains formally with them.   For the time being, therefore, a change of thekind suggested by the Joint Evidence Committee    is        of little practical importance if it represents  no more than a change in the proportion of totalremuneration that  is regarded as compensation for out-of-hours responsibilities;it assumes   importance only if the increase in the supplementary capitationfee is treated as an increase in total income.   However, new terms of service are being discussed which may allow doctors to opt out of their formalresponsibility   for their patients out of hours,   provided that the executivecouncil can arrange for another practitioner to take over, and the out-of-hourspayments will then be paid to the practitioner who takes over.   When thishappens it will be important that the remuneration for out-of-hours work shouldbe enough to encourage sufficient doctors to take on out-of-hours responsibilitieswithout being so high that the financial loss will deter those who may wish toopt out from doing so.   Judgements on this matter may therefore need to be revised in the light of experience when new arrangements come into force.For the present, we think it right to be guided by the profession^ vievs, butto recommend an increase to the lower limit (28p) of the range they havesuggested.   We do not think, however, that this increase, which is of somesignificance in relation to a doctor&apos;s total remuneration, should be treatedas an addition to the total, without regard to the other considerations we haveto hear in mind in deciding what the total should be.   We have thereforetreated it like the increases in other fees dealt with in this chapter as achange in the distribution of income rather than a change in the total amount.
Night visit fee84.  Doctors at present receive   a fee of  2.50 for visits to patients ontheir lists between the hours of midnight and 7 am.   This is not a particularlylarge sum, though it must be remembered that it is only part of the totalremuneration received for out-of-hours responsibilities in general.   the profession are discussing with the Health Departments the possibility of introducing an evening visit fee, which would operate in the hours beforemidnight - from, say, 7 pm.   We hope on some future occasion to consider the evening and night visit fees together, and for the present we recommend a modest increase in the level of the night visit fee to  3.   It seems to us,however, that the division between evening and night should not bo made at midnightbut at the somewhat earlier hour at which a doctor (if he is to bo up to 7 am) mightnormally be assumed to have gone to bed.   We suggest therefore that the feewe have recommended for night visits should be payable from 11 pm, and thatthis change in the regulations should not be held up pending agreem*ant on theintroduction of an evening visit fee.Designated area payments85.  These payments, which were introduced in 1966, are designed to encouragedoctors to set up new practices in places where lists are large.   Initially,they were paid in areas  with average list sizes in excess of about 2,500;in 1970 a two-level system of payment was introduced, the higher amount goingto practitioners in areas   with average lists above 3.000.   The payments aremade as additions to the basic practice allowance, the higher amount beingcurrently  750 a year, and the lower amount  490 a year.    A   recent (and as yet unpublished) study by the Health Service Research Unit of the university of Kent has revealed grounds for doubt as to whether the payments in theirpresent form are making an effective contribution towards solving the problemof under-doctored areas, and the matter is to be discussed between the health departments and the profession in the near future.   In the circumstances we46
CONFIDENTIALdo not recommend any change in the amount of these payments at present; nor do v/e think it would be appropriate to recommend some change:; in the auministra-tive arrangements which the Joint Evidence Committee has asked us to consider.Average net remuneration8c.    This concludes our review of the particular fees and allowances that we felt it necessary to consider on this occasion, but leads us to a further point which it is convenient to mention here.   We explained in our 1971 report that because doctors&apos; remuneration is made up of a variety of different fees and allowances, and it is impracticable to forecast exactly what the product ofeach will be, the average gross remuneration of a doctors in a given year maybe a little less or a little more than we expect.   The average net remunerationis subject to a further degree of uncertainty because in recommending the amountof fees and allowances we need to allow for practice expenses and these alsomay differ from the amount we expect.   The amounts paid out by executive councils in the year 1971-72 have been rather larger than we expected, and if our estimateof practice expenses in 1971-72 was right, doctors&apos; average net remuneration hasconsequently been somewhat above the figure of  5,185 that we intended.   As wesaid in our 1971 report, we accept the principle that over-payments or under-payraents are not carried forward into the neost year, though we shall do our best to ensure that there is no persistent tendency to over-payments or under-paymentstaking one year with another.87*   It has been put to us on this occasion, by the Health Departments and the profession, that part of the over-payment (compared with the amount we intended)in 1972-72 is due to the fact that designated area ^payments have been made to alarger number of doctors than was expected.   It was suggested that if we decidedgeneral practitioners&apos; remuneration ought to be increased by a certain amount in1972-73, compared with 1971-72, it would be right to take as our starting pointnot a sum of  5,185, but a larger sum incorporating the amount (probably about 40  as an average over all general practitioners ) by which designated area47
payments had exceeded the extimate.   We are not convinced, however, that thiswooId be the right course.   As we see them, designated area payments were intended to bring about some redistribution, of income in favour of doctors who practiced, or set up new practices, in under-doctored areas.   If we wereto follow the course proposed we should to some extent be shielding doctors inother areas from the effect of this redistribution.   It does not seem to usto be necessary to do so at a time when lists generally have begun to fall;though it is a matter we might well consider in a different light if thesum involved were larger, or if the arrangements for payment of designated areaallowances were less open to criticism, so that we could feel sure there was an effective distinction between under-doctored areas and others, and that the allowances were achieving the purpose for which they were intended.88. It remains, therefore, to set out our intention as regards the effect ofthe recommendations for fees and allowances that we are making in AppendixOur estimate of the average practice expenses that general practitioners will,have to meet in 1972-73 is  2,230.   We consider that average net remunerationshould he increased by 7&apos;ir per cent from the  5,185 recommended for1971-72 to  5,575 for 1972-73.   Our aim accordingly has been to producethis level of net remuneration after allowing for a sum of  2,230 inpractice expenses.48
chapter 7 CONFIDENTIALGENERAL DENTAL PRACTITIONERS89.    It is cur function to recommend a target average net income for dentistsworking as principals within the general dental service of the nhs.   The DentalKates Study Group, which comprises representatives of the profession and the health Departments under an independent Chairman, determines gross fees foreach item of dental service in such a way that the target for the averagedentist is achieved after making due allowance for practice expenses.90.     We have shown in an earlier chapter that although there has apparently been some reduction in the hours worked by the average dentist since the pilkington Commission carried out its enquiries, there has been a considerable increase in the number of courses of dental treatment given, although this doesnot imply a strictly proportionate increase in the volume of work done.   Theincrease in volume which has occurred can be explained partly by the risingproportion of younger dentists and by improvements in equipment, but we think thatsome part of it must be attributed to increased effort and improved practiceorganisation.   Further, the increase within the general dental service in the projtier, of younger dentists, who are generally able to earn more than older ones, mesthat some part of dentists increase in earnings has been due solely to the change the age composition and the target earnings are not increased to take this changein composition into account.91,     Our information about the number and quality of students seeking to enter the dental schools suggests that dentistry appears to be less attractive thanmedicine, and indeed that dentistry is one of the faculties for whichuniversities have the smallest surplus of applicants with the requiredqualifications.   Although the position is not critical, and there are some signs that it has improved in the last few years, we cannot feel confident that in the longer term the dental, schools will find enough candidateswith the required qualifications to fill all the places that are being provided in the current expansion.49
92,      For all these reasons we consider that our recommendation about dentists&apos;remuneration should be such as to bring about a modest improvement   in their income compared with that of most other groups.   V/e recommend that the targetaverage net income, which was  4,653 in 1971-72, should be increased by 8  percent to  5,050 in 1972-73.50
OPHTHALMIC MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS93.   About 82 per cent of sight tests carried out in the National Health service are done by ophthalmic opticians.   The arrangements for these tests and the fees involved are not within our terms of   reference.   The remaining 18 per cent of tests are done by ophthalmic medical practitioners, who are doctors; it falls to us to recommend their fee.94. There are currently just under 1,000 ophthalmic medical practitioners incontract with the NHS in Great Britain? about half of them hold part-time hospitalposts as consultants or in training grades, mostly in the ophthalmology specially ,and others hold part-time appointments in other sections of the NHS   or with local authorities.   We are told by the profession that there are very fewwho carry out sight-testing as a full-time occupation, though we have no way ofknowing the exact number.95.  The current fee for each sight-test is  1.50, of which  1.10 is regardedas net remuneration and the balance of 40p is intended to meet the practitioner&apos;sexpenses, and to represent a contribution from the NHS in lieu of superannuation.For some years up to 1966 the   net  fee was adjusted in step with adjustments inthe salaries of consultants and SHM0&apos;s in the hospital service; in 1966 the health Departments questioned this arrangement, and the Kindersley Review Bodydecided that the automatic link with salaries was unrealistic and it would bemore appropriate to consider the matter on its own merits.   Thenceforward, their recommendations about the net fee did not necessarily follow their recommendations on hospital doctors&apos; salaries.   The last increase was one of 10 per cent, as recommended in the Twelfth Kindersley Report, which took effect from April1970,.increasing the net fee from  1.00 to  1.10.   We made no recommendationabout this matter in our 1971 report.51
CONFIDENTIAL96,    We agree with our predecessors that it is unrealistic   to link movements in the net fee automatically to movements in salaries.   The great majority ofophthalmic medical practitioners are not engaged in sight-testing as a full-timeoccupation, and we have no information about the eardngs of the few that are.Nor are we in a position to estimate what their full-time earnings might be,since the last enquiry about the time taken over a sight-test was carried outby means of a sample questionnaire as long ago as 19^9.   And there is noup-to-date information about the expenses that  ophthalmic medical practitionersactually incur, the last survey on this subject having been carried out in 1965.97*    The gross sight-testing fee for ophthalmic opticians was increased on1 January 1972, and is now  1.55.   It was arrived at by negotiation on a quite -different basis from the fee of an ophthalmic general practitioner, and the twocan only be compared in a very general sense.   Nevertheless, the Joint EvidenceCommittee have represented that in the past ophthalmic medical practitionershave received a higher fee than ophthalmic opticians because of the additionalexpertise resulting from their medical training.   They contend that the range of service given by an ophthalmic medical practitioner is wider than that givenby an ophthalmic optician since the former is better able to detect pathologicalconditions and diagnose them.   It is difficult to draw conclusions from this argument, however, because it is only the gross fees (including expenses) that can reliably be compared. There are no up-to-date and reliable figures for theactual expenses of either opthalmic medical practitioners or opthalmic opticians,so that we cannot satisfactorily compare the actual net fees that they earn. TheJoint Evidence Committee also represented that ophthalmic medical practitioners1 workhelps to reduce the burden in hospital outpatients .&apos; departments and that it is in theinterests of ophthalmology generally that a significant number of sight testsshould be carried out by medically qualified specialists.       Indeed, no consultantophthalmologist can become a master of his work until he has carried out severalthousand ordinary sight tests.52
98,   We accept that there is a case for an increase in the fee, but here, as elsewhere in this report, we are in a difficulty because of the lack of accurateor up-to-date information.   The Departments proposed some two years ago thatthere should be an exploratory activity study of the practices of ophthalmicmedical practitioners, with a view to getting factual information about thecircumstances to which the fee relates, but the profession were reluctant toagree.   We recognise that it may be undesirable to attempt to define with toomuciLiJrscision the time taken over a professional service; but it is equallyundesirable to determine the level of a fee without at least a general ideaof the amount of time the service takes up, and the amount of expense itentails.   We hope therefore that it will be possible to find a besis for a study that will enable the parties to produce more concrete evidence on a future occasion.   Meanwhile, we recommend that the net fee should beincreased to  1.25; the provision for expenses and the contribution in lieu of superannuation should, as before, be settled between the Departments and the profession.53
r*OiMCinCMTI A ICvJINriDblM I IALSUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS99,, The changes ve propose in doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; remuneration are set out in detail in Appendices III and IV.   Their main effect can besummarised as follows:-Increase in 1972/73over 1971/72(per cent)Salaries of hospital doctors and dentistsand administrative medical staff:House officers 7.5Senior house officers 11.8 - 13.1 (average 12.3)Registrars 13.0 - 13.7 (average 13.2)Senior registrars . 13.0 - 15.6 (average 14.5)Consultants 7*other hospital grades .7.5Administrative medical staff 7.general medical practitioners:Recommended net remuneration from fees and allowances 7*5*Ophthalmic medical practitioners:Net remuneration 13.6-       . &apos;: \X\&apos;.v.- -   &apos;./&apos;&apos;vV;      &apos;        I.&quot;:&apos;General dental practitioners:Target average net income 8.5100.        w*e estimate the overall cost of these increases, excluding provisionfor practice expenses but including the effect on superannuation, at about 27 million, or 8 per cent of estimated net remuneration in 1971/72.101       We have said that we may well need to review doctors&apos; and dentists&quot;remuneration more frequently than was normal in the past.    During thepresent year negotiations will be going on for changes in hospital doctors&apos;contracts which are likely, in any case, to call for further recommendations by us early in 1973-   We propose, therefore, to begin a review of the remuneration Of all categories of NHS doctors and dentists towardsthe end of 1972.   This will enable us to consider whether any changes arenecessary during the next year, v If it does appear to us that changes are called for in the remuneration of hospital doctors or of other categoriesit will be our aim to make recommendations that can be put into effect on1st April 19J3...    &apos; ^*   The increase is over the level recommended for 19/,l/?2 in our last report.After taking account of expenses to be reimbursed it represents an average increasein gross fees and allowances of 6.3 per cent over those paid in 1971/72.54

CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX IQUALIFICATIONS OF CANDIDATES FOR MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCHOOLS(a)   Academic qualifications1.   Academic qualifications are only one of the attributes sought by medical and dental schools and the statements about such qualifications must be read withthis important reservation.   Discussion of the other personal qualities looked for in candidates follows in part (b) of this Appendix.2.   Table 1 is based on data provided by the Universities Central Councilon Admissions (UCCA) and gives details of the GGE Advanced Level qualificationsof candidates accepted by British universities in 1970.3t It shows that medicine had a higher-than-average proportion of the studentswith the highest qualifications (better than the equivalent of three Grade Bpasses^) but that mathematics, physics, law, english and history all had higherproportions.   Medicine had the third highest proportion with at least the equivalent of three Cs (after law and history) and the highest proportion of allwith at least three passes.    The figures for dental candidates reveal a very different situation: the table shows that the proportion of well-qualifiedstudents was lower for dentistry than for any other subject (apart fromeducation, where the numbers are probably too small to be significant) althoughthe proportion admitted with less than three Advanced Level passes was a littlebelow the average, a great many dental students having three passes with lessthan the equivalent of three Cs.4.   The last column of the table shows the proportion of students whose subjectof acceptance had been their first choice.   For &quot;medicine, dentistry and health&quot;the proportion (91 per cent) was higher than for any other group? apart from&quot;architecture and other professional and vocational studies&quot;.   However, fordentistry alone the proportion (two thirds of home and overseas candidates) wascomparatively low.   The figures also show that about 30 per cent of thoseadmitted to dental schools had originally had medicine as their subject of firstchoice, and that these students were less likely to have good qualifications thanthe ones who had opted for dentistry in the first place (e*g. 17 as against35 per cent with three Cs or their equivalent).1There are five grades of pass in the GCE Advanced Level examination,

confidential,   Comparable statistics are available for candidates admitted in 1969and these show a small but consistent improvement in the standard for bothmedicine and dentistry.   For example, the proportion of medical students(both home and overseas) admitted with the equivalent of at least three C&apos;sincreased from 75.6 per cent of all candidates with Advanced Level qualificationsto 80.5 per cent in 1970.    For dental students the corresponding proportionincreased from 25.5 per cent to 29.7, and evidence submitted to us by the health departments for this review shows that the improvement has continued at leastsince 1965.6.    The following table gives details of the qualifications of those 1970candidates whose first choice was either medicine or dentistry and who were not accepted for any subject.    The table shows that the rejected medical candidateswere, on average, better qualified, and those for dentistry less well qualified,than candidates for other subjects.TABLE 2Qualifications of candidates with GCE Advanced Level passes who were not accepted for any subject in 1970 (a)	1st choice medicine	1st choice dentistry	1st choice any other subject (b)		cumulative	cumulative	cumulative		per cent	per cent	per cent	Better than three Grade B passes (or equivalent)	2.6	nil	1.8	At least three Grade C passes (or equivalent)	11.7	nil	8.7	At least three passes At least two passes At least one pass	40.2 77.6 100.0	20.0 63.3 100.0	35.6 73.5 100.0	Percentage of candidates with Advanced Level qualifications	per cent 57.9	per cent 54.1	per cent 69.9	Percentage of candidates with other qualifications	42.1	45.9	30.1	Total number of candidates not accepted for any subject	number 4,360	number 555	number 53,485		per cent	per cent	per cent	Total as percentage of all 1st choice applications	57.5	47.4	49.5	1Ta7Based on a sample of candidates not accepted,Source: UCCA(b) Based on substracting acceptances through UCCA from applications through UCCACONFIDENTIAL
confidential ,   The lower qualifications of dental school applicants reflect in part the much greater attraction to students of a medical career, in terms of both varietyand career prospects.    The relative shortage of candidates for dental schools isalso reflected in the fact that the proportion of first choice candidates rejectedtos lower for dentistry than for medicine (47.4 per cent as against 57.5).(b)   Other personal qualities8,   In addition to the academic qualifications analysed above, other specificqualities are looked for in candidates for admission to medical and dental schools.These non-academic qualities are obviously less quantifiable, but we determined tofind out as much about them as we oould.   For this purpose we sought the assistanceof the Deans of a representative sample of medical and dental schools in answering a small number of questions which had been designed to enable us to form a better impression of the criteria used in judging candidates and of the quality of candidates offeringthemselves for selection.   We are grateful for the answers which we received and forthe care which had been taken in making the position clear to us.\The questions we asked, together with a summary of the replies, are set out below.Question 1In admitting a candidate to medical/dental school do you look for any specific personal qualities, and if so can you describe what thesequalities are?The answers to this question disclosed that the non-academic qualities looked forby most medical schools, whether at interviews or in headmasters1 or headmistresses&apos;reports, included a sense of vocation, an interest in people, a certain ease ofmanner, and a reasonable degree of maturity and stability.   These qualities were alsosought by dental schools, usually together with some evidence of manual dexterity.^    -Replies were received from the following medical and dental schools:-University of Birmingham - Dental SchoolUniversity of Bristol - Faculty of MedicineUniversity of Edinburgh - Medical and Dental SchoolsUniversity of Glasgow - Faculty of MedicineGuy&apos;s Hospital (London) - Medical and Dental SchoolsUniversity of Liverpool - New Medical SchoolUniversity of London - &quot; Charing Cross Hospital Medical SchoolUniversity of London       ^ - London Hospital Medical College Dental SchoolUniversity of London -&apos; Royal Free Hospital School of MedicineUniversity of London - University College Hospital Dental SchoolUniversity of Manchester - Medical and Dental SchoolsUniversity of Newcastle-upon-Tyne - Dental SchoolUniversity of Nottingham - Medical SchoolSt Bartholomew^ Hospital (London) - Medical CollegeUniversity of Sheffield - School of Dental SurgeryUniversity of Southampton -i Faculty of MedicineUniversity of Wales - The Welsh National School of Medicine
Practice as regards the incidence of interviews was by no means uniform; the replies showed that,while interviews were only very exceptionally carried out at one university and only for borderline cases in another, at others thepractice was to interview 3,4 or 5 times as many candidates as the number of available places.Question 2To what extent would your judgement of personal qualities take precedence in accepting a candidate over academic attainment - forexample, would you normally expect to admit a candidate with thebest academic qualifications and only start judging on othercriteria at some particular lower level of academic attainment?Most medical schools gave academic attainment as the prime consideration and added that, generally speaking, judgement on non-academic criteria began atthe lower levels of academic attainment.   In one school, however, equalprecedence was given to both academic and other personal qualities.In both medical and dental schools it appeared likely that a highly academica!qualified candidate would only exceptionally be rejected for reasons ofunsuitable personal qualities.Question 3To what extent would you consider that the medical candidateswhom you reject because of lack of places are in fact suitablematerial which you would accept were the places available?yThe replies to this question showed clearly that a significant number of medical candidates rejected because of a lack of places would have made,suitable doctors.^ Some stated that the position was more difficult forwomen applicants.Question 4Are you satisfied with the general quality of/the dental candidateswhom you are accepting and/or do you have difficulty in filling theavailable places? vThe majority of dental schools replying to this question had experienceddifficulty in filling all their places with candidates of the right quality.59
Question 5CONFIDENTIALHas there been a significant change in the last few years inthe quality of candidates presenting themselves for selection?There was fairly general agreement that the standard of medical candidateshad improved markedly over the past few years and that of candidates for dentalschools in most cases showed an improvement in &apos;the last year or two.   Individualreplies stated that personal qualities.or academic attainments had improved,and exceptionally so in the last year.q.      In sum, the answers given by deans of medical and dental schools do notindicate that there is reason, at present, to foresee difficulty in filling the expanding medical schools, but do give cause for concern about the flow of students into dental schools.   This suggests that in our future work we shallhave to pay particular attention to the rate of recruitment to the dentalprofession.60
CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX II 1 .MOVEMENTS SIMCE 1955/56 Ijj THE EARNINGS OF NATIONAL HEALTH SjjitVICE DCCTOHSAND DENTISTS COMPARED WITH OTHER PROFESSIONSIntroduction1 The accompanying tables are intended to compare the movements since1955/56 in the earnings of National Health Service doctors and dentistswith such data as are available on the earnings of other professions.The analysis is mainly concerned with movements in earnings rather thandirect comparisons of levels,  for which studies in greater depth would berequired,  taking into account relative qualifications, periods of training,the amount of capital invested in practices, superannuation provisions,fringe benefits and other factors.    However, in addition to the indicesof movement over time,  the tables also give the most recent figures onthe spread of earnings by age.Selection of data2 The professions selected for inclusion are, for the most part, those covered by the Report of the Royal Commission on Doctors&apos;  and -Dentists&apos;Remuneration (Cmnd. 939) of February i960.    Most of the earnings statisticscollected by the Commission related to 1955/56 and the comparative statisticsprovided in this appendix include all the material on the practice andsalaried earnings of the professions which has been published since thattime, except where the figures do not appear to be adequately comparable.The tables also show changes since 1955/56 in some of the more importantsalary scales included in the Royal Commission Report.Financial year basis3 For doctors and dentists and most other professions, practiceearnings are generally analysed on a financial year basis (or sometimeson the basis of accounts ending in a particular financial year).    the periods covered by the statistics on salaried earnings vary, but are fullydescribed in Annex A.    In the case of salary scales, to avoid thecomplication of comparing different effective dates, weighted averages for financial years have been calculated, taking into account the proportionof time before and after any pay increase.Choice of base date for time series4 Because most of the earnings statistics given in the Royal commission report relate to 1955/56 this year has been chosen as the starting point for the historical series.    However, the recommendations on doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; pay covered the 3-year period commencing 1 January 1960, so the base date for the indices has been chosen within this period.   The RoyalCommission recommendations were based on estimated earnings at the timeof the Report and included an allowance for expected inflation during thethree years.    It could, be argued therefore that the appropriate base isthe middle of the period, i.e. 1961.    On the other hand it is not certainhow accurately the Commission estimated the rise in the earnings of other professions between 1955/56 and 1960, or how the allowance made forinflation compared with actual rises in 1960/62.    Because some under-estimation may have occurred the base date for the indices is taken asthe financial year 1960/61 instead of the calendar year 1961.    Sinceinformation on professional earnings is not generally available for that61
year, the indices are base the average index forthe medical and dental profession as a whole in 1955/56, based on1960/61=100.    By this means all the indices are reasonably comparable with one another and are based approximately on the level recommendedby the Royal Commission as 100.    For a few series, where data are notavailable for either 1955/56 or 1960/61,  the indices have been calculatedby linking with directly comparable series for the same profession or,alternatively, with the Department of Employment1s Salary Index.%   The choice of base years is, of course, appropriate (with the reservationsset out elsewhere in this report) to doctors and dentists only.   It permitscomparisons between their earnings and the generality of other earnings.   It wouldnot be right to draw conclusions about the remuneration of any other singleprofession from the figures set out here, since the base years chosen might be wholly inappropriate for them.Description of tables6,        Table 1  is a summary table showing all the indices based on either1960/61=100 or 1955/56=79-    Table 2 shows a&apos;selection, mainly minima ormaxima,  of the salaries paid to the main grades of hospital doctor/ dentist,together with Inland Revenue data on the earnings from all sources of medical Consultants.    Table 3 includes various series on the earnings,actual and recommended, of general medical and dental practitioners.Tables 4 and 5 cover practice and salaried earnings in other professionsand Table 6 a selection of salary scales.    Table 7 gives the results ofa study of movements in male salaries at different levels, undertaken bythe Office of Manpower Economics using Inland Revenue data.    This material is supplemented by the results of a recent salary survey conducted by theOffice, and by figures from the Department of employment s New iiiarningsSurvey.    Finally, Table 8 shows indices of the spx-ead of earnings by age,for doctors and dentists and other professions, based on the age-group40-44 as 100.    The actual salaries of graduates in a few large companies- technical graduates (research and non-research) and accountants - arenot shown, on grounds of confidentiality, though indices for them areincluded in Table 1 .7.        Graphs A, B and C depict the movements in the earnings of the mainhospital grades, and of general practitioners, compared with the DE SalaryIndex and the most appropriate level of male salaries taken from thepercentile series in Table 7.    In the graphs the movements shown are basedon the actual dates of change, rather than averages for financial years.8.        Annex A describes the sources of the various figures, the numberscovered by the surveys, the definitions used and comments on any questionsof comparabilityComments on comparisons within the medical and dental professions9.        It is clear that the house officer and the general medical practitioner (income from the NHS and, to a lessor extent, from all sources)had substantially larger increases between 1960/61 and 1971/72 than otherdoctors and dentists: over 140 per cent in the case of the pre-registrationHouse Officer.    The higher earnings of the general practitioner stemmainly from the Seventh Kindersley Report which inaugurated the &quot;Charter&quot;system of payment.    Though this was introduced in 1966/67,  its effect wasnot fully reflected until the following year, as a result of defermentassociated with the incomes policy &quot;freeze&quot;.    Since 1968/69 medical practitioners&apos;  earnings from the NHS have continued to rise somewhatfaster than those of hospital doctors, though their total earnings donot appear to have kept pace.10.        In the hospital service, apart from the house officer, the increases range down from about 85 per cent for the senior house officer,registrar and senior registrar grades to 75 Per cent at the maximum ofthe consultant&apos;s scale.    (The junior doctors also had larger increasesthan the career grades bet^^i^l^^^Tf J^O. )
11. In any evaluation of the relativity between general medical practitioners and salaried hospital doctors, one factor to be takeninto account is the more favourable superannuation provisions enjoyed by salaried doctors, whose pensions are based on salary in the last three years of service while general practitioners&apos;  pensions are basedon lifetime contributions.    In a period of rapid inflation and generalimprovements in pension provision, this difference is of increasing importance.12. Turning to general dental practitioners, the &quot;target&quot; MIS earningsincreased by 94 per cent up to 1971/72.    Actual earnings (both from the nhs and from all sources; increased significantly less than this,  mainly because, during the period 1960/63?  it was found that actual earningswere well above the level recommended by the Royal Commission.    As aresult, scale fees were held down in the early 1960&apos;s.    For this reason it is appropriate, when comparing dentists&apos;  earnings with those in themedical and other professions, to calculate the indices on the basis ofthe Royal Commission^ target (as revised by the Dental Rates Study Group)rather than actual earnings in 1960/61.Comments on the relative movements in earnings between doctors and dentistsand other professions13,      Comparisons with practice and salaried earnings in other professions areconstrained by the availability of information.     In some cases the most recentfigures relate to 1968/69 or even earlier, i.e. before the substantial increases for the medical and dental professions from 1970/71 which may or may not have beenmatched in other professions over the three years 1968/69 to 197V72.14. The relatively low figure for barristers&apos;  practice earnings in1967/68 is estimated.from Inland Revenue data and is not very reliable.The figure for solicitors in 1968/69 shows an increase over 1960/61similar to that for general medical practitioners but ahead of most otherdoctors and dentists.    This is also true of the practice earnings ofarchitects in 1969/70.    The reservations expressed above aboutdisadvantageous pension arrangements for those in private practiceapply equally to these professions, whose members have to make their own arrangements to provide pensions from lifetime earnings.   The indices forthe salaried or mainly salaried earnings of barristers, engineers andchemists (Fellows and Associates of the R.I.C.) appear to be comparable to those for junior hospital doctors and for dental- practitioners, butthe earnings of salaried architects have risen much faster.    The movementsup to 1968/69 in the earnings (mainly salaried) of actuaries and unversity teachers were in line with those of general medical practitioners,somewhat below those of the house officer but above those of otherhospital doctors and general dental practitioners.    The comparison withthe salary scales of various officers in the medical and dental professions,teachers, civil servants, etc. shows increases which range from 52 per cent(town clerk) to 107 per cent (ward sister) but are mostly between 70 and90 per cent, which is again comparable to most of the doctors&apos; and dentists&apos;increases, apart from the houvse officer and general medical practitioner.Comments on comparisons with general indices15. The indices of male salaries at various percentile points of the inland Revenue distributions are based on the DE Salary Index for october 1959.    (Taking i960 as 100,  this index is 95)    Salaries at the63
50th percentile (median),  25th (upper quartile; and 10th (highest decile)show slightly larger increases than the DE Salary Index.    Much of thedifference is accounted for by the fact that salaries above the 5thpercentile, which carry a greater weight in the DE&apos;s average, have shownmuch lower increases.   The remaining discrepancy is not due to the inclusionof females in the DE index, since their figure for males alone shows a slightly bigger increase than the total index.    The explanation may well bein the much fuller coverage of the Inland Revenue figures, which relate tosome 3-4 million male salary earners above the cut-off point as against 2&apos;gmillion (employed in production industries,  public service and finance,, whoare covered by the Salary Index.    It may also be that the lower half of the salary distribution has shown rather smaller increases than the median.l6f       The main interest in the percentile table is the evidence that, overthe whole period shown, there has been a tendency for the highest salariesto attract significantly smaller increases than median salaries.    Thefigures for the last two years, which are based on material from the DE&apos;s: ew Earnings Survey and the OME1s 1972 Salary Survey,  suggest that this tendency is continuing.    However, there may be a significant offset to thisfrom the increase in fringe benefits, which probably affect higher salaryearners more than those at lower levels.17*       The earnings of technical graduates in a few large companies, both in research and other work, have shown slightly smaller increases than the DESalary Index, but their salaries are well above the average (about the 10thpercentile).   The salaries of accountants in the various companies have risen faster than the DE index.Comments on the spread of earnings by age18,       Table 8 shows indices based on age-group 40-44 as 100 for, inter alia,general medical practitioners and medical consultants.    Because roughly halfthe junior hospital doctors go on to become general practitioners, the earnings of the two groups are averaged within each age group so as togive more realistic, though approximate, career patterns.    It will be seenthat the general practitioners do not show much variation in earnings afterage 35, and reach their peak earnings between 45 and 54 (on average) whereasconsultants&apos;  earnings have a much wider spread and typically reach theirpeak after age 55*    In fact, apart perhaps from actuaries (whose earningsrise further in later years compared to age 40-44) consultants show the widest spread of any of the professions analysed, while general practitionersshow the smallest.    A wide spread of earnings has,  of course, a significant effort on the amount of tax paid over a lifetime under a progressive systemof direct taxes on income, and also a (probably more important) contraryeffect on the individuals pension, which is commonly based on the lastyear or years before retirement    .    Moreover, in comparing the spread of earnings between general medical practitioners and/consultants, it has tobe remembered that they start from the same level of junior hospital doctor:any difference in the spread of earnings is due to the higher levels reached by consultants in later life.19.       Table 8 also illustrates the fact that older dentists tend to earnappreciably less than those who have entered the profession relatively recently.2   However, special arrangements are made for general practitioners to increasethe proportion of their earnings in later life that counts towards theirpension64
2C. It is sometimes argued that earnings by age are best looked at interms of lifetime earnings, on the assumption that numbers in each 5-yearage group are equal.    Such figures have been used for comparing earnings between professions:    they differ from comparisons of averages only in sofar as the relative numbers in each age group vary between professions,due to differences in recruitment and wastage by age.    Vhese variationsare not generally very significant. It is also argued that future &quot;careerearnings&quot;, calculated as described above,  should be discounted by somearbitrary rate of interest to give the present value of lifetime earningsat the age of entry into the profession.    Such calculations may be of somevalue in considering the relative financial attractions of particular careersthe time of entry, but they are not relevant to the consideration of appropriate relativities between professions for older people.    In anycase it is difficult to find an arbitrary rate of interest which provides a true measure of the value of expected earnings over a lifetime.1     This appendix is based on a paper prepared by the Office of manpower Economics and submitted to the Health Departments andthe professions prior to this review.    Some extracts from thepaper were included in the Joint Evidence Committee&apos;s writtenevidence which, as usual, is to be published by the british medical Association.   However, as some small amendments and additions have been made since the preparation of the originalpaper, Table 1 and Graphs A and B in this appendix differslightly from the versions in the published evidence.65

SOURCES OF DATA ON EARNINGSMEDICAL AND DENTAL PROFESSIONS (Tables 2 and 3)Hospital doctors and dentists.      Table 2 shows movements since 1955/56 in the basic salaries of hospital doctors and dentists.   Eight salary points have been chosen as being representativeof the full spread of clinical salaries.    These are the scale minimum for each of thefive main grades (or, in the case of senior house officers and consultants, the lowestsalary point not linked to age l), the maximum for house officers and for consultants,and the fourth point on the senior registrars&apos; scale.2.      The table also shows the average net income of medical consultants from all sources.    The 1955/56 figures are from the income survey undertaken for the RoyalCommission but those for 1965/66 and subsequent years are from a special inquiryconducted by the Inland Revenue.    These Inland Revenue figures are not entirelycomparable with the earlier ones as they include senior hospital medical officers withallowances, but their numbers are quite small.    Because no 1960/61 figures areavailable the indices are based on 1955/56 as 79, i.e. the index(based on 1960/61 as100) for the medical and dental professions as a whole and also, incidentally, for themaximum of the consultants&apos; basic scale.3.      Table 3 shows the corresponding movements in the earnings of general practitioners.The figures represent general medical practitioners&apos; earnings from all sources,from all official sources (including hospitals, local authorities etc.) and from NHSgeneral practice (actual and recommended), and general dental practitioners&apos; earnings from all sources and from NHS general practice (actual and target).4.      The &quot;all sources&quot; figures for doctors are based on an Inland Revenue inquirywhich covers income under Schedules D and E, the Schedule D income being adjusted toan earnings basis by allowing for late payment of &quot;pool balances&quot; and arrears.   Until1966/67 the inquiry was confined to doctors under 70 but since then it has covered allages.   This has been taken into account in calculating the indices.    The 1970/71 income is a preliminary estimate.5.      The figures for &quot;all official sources&quot; from 1960/61 onwards are the levelsrecommended by the Royal Commission and, subsequently, the Kindersley Review Body.However,the Central Pool system, which was operated until 1966, ensured that actualaverage net income was equal to the recommended level.   Since that time therecommendations have related to NHS income only but, for purposes of calculating theindices, the series have been linked using the relativity which obtained in 1965/66(viz. average net income of  3,000 from all official sources and  2,775 from the NHS).In the past some staff have been paid at lower rates.    On the other hand, when a consultant is first appointed, he can be paid a starting salary at any of thefour next incremental points above the minimum of the scale, by reason of age,special experience, etc.
7.      The NHS earnings of doctors are estimated by the Health Departments.    Like the&quot;all sources&quot; figures, these relate to doctors under 70 until 1966/67 but to all agesthereafter and, once again, a linked series is shown in the table.    The figure for1971/72 is provisional.8.      General dental practitioners&apos; earnings from all sources are from another InlandRevenue inquiry.    The time series figures relate to Schedule D income only butsalaried earnings are quite negligible.    The NHS earnings shown are the health departments&apos; estimates.9.      The &quot;target&quot;   income for dentists, as envisaged by the Royal Commission, wasthe level recommended for a single-handed practitioner working the average number of hours in the general dental service, and a Dental Rates Study Group was set up totranslate this recommendation into a scale of fees.    This Study Group adjusted therecommendation to  2,400 for &quot;all principals, full-time and part-time together, workingwholly or partly in the general dental services&quot; and, as all subsequent targets havebeen on this basis, it is the revised target which is shown in the table.10.     The First Report of the Kindersley Review Body, while recommending a new targetincome ( 2,740) did not specify precisely when it should come into effect.    There istherefore some doubt as to what the target for the fiscal year 1963/64 should be, andit has therefore been omitted from the table.11.     The Second Report of the Kindersley Review Body (dated 10 December 1964)recommended an immediate increase in the target from  2,740 to a level subsequentlystated (in the Sixth Report) to be  2,950.    The target for 1964/65 may therefore betaken as the average of these two levels, weighted according to the lengths of time before and after the submission of the recommendation (36 weeks and 16 weeksrespectively).   For similar reasons the target figures shown for 1967/68 and 1968/69are weighted averages of Review Body recommendations.OTHER PROFESSIONS (Tables 4, 5 and 6)12.     The figures for 1955/56 are all from the survey undertaken by the RoyalCommission, apart from that for chemists, which comes from a survey undertaken by theHoyal Institute of Chemistry.806.      Since the abolition of the Pool, i.e. from 1966/67 onwards, actual earningshave been able to diverge from the recommended level, and indeed the KindersleyReview Body did not state the average net income which it hoped to achieve by its recommendations (though various indications were given).   The figures shown in the table for the years from 1966/67 to 1970/71 (inclusive) represent the presentReview Body&apos;s interpretation of the recommendations of the Seventh, Tenth and TwelfthKindersley Reports.
14.     The median earnings of salaried barristers are from surveys undertaken bythe Bar Association for Commerce, Finance and Industry in July 1967 and July 1970.These surveys covered all the members of the Association, numbering about 270 in 1967and 360 in 1970, of whom about 60 per cent provided information on earnings.    the overall medians have been estimated from grouped distributions given in the reporton the 1970 survey and the 1967 value has been linked to the DE Salary Index.3olicitors15.     All the figures for solicitors relate to England and Wales only.    The practiceearnings shown for 1966/67 and 1968/69 actually relate on average to the years endingOctober 1966 and October 1968 and are taken from two surveys by the National board for Prices and Incomes (Reports 54 and 134).   Each survey collected information from about 400 practices (out of a total of about 7,000 in England and Wales) whereas theRoyal Commission had co-operation from about 950 individual solicitors. (On averagethere are about two and a quarter principals per practice.)16.     The data on salaried solicitors are from NBPI Report No. 54.    The earnings inprofessional firms are based on the first of the two surveys referred to above, andrelate to about 200 assistant solicitors. Tbe earnings in commerce and industry arefrom a separate survey covering about 700 solicitors shown by Law Society records tobe so employed, and the figures relate to the earnings (in the year to July 1967) ofabout 330 individuals who replied and were found to spend at least half their timeori legal work.   Both these sources appear to be reasonably comparable with theRoyal Commission Report.Architects7&quot;&quot;&apos;. &quot;\ ;....../ [[&apos;.&apos; - &quot;&apos;     1&apos;&apos;&quot;       &apos;&apos; / &apos; ;v.&apos;       &apos; 1;&apos;&apos; &quot;&apos; ;,X&apos;&apos;&quot;   :,:17.     The Royal Commissions figures were based on a one in five sample of thecorporate members of the Royal Institute of British Architects.    Of the 3,000individuals approached, about 1,750 actually provided information.18.     The Royal Institute conducted its own surveys in 1964 and 1970.    These had a slightly wider coverage in that they also included registered architects who werenot corporate members of BIBA.   However, this is not thought to invalidate the comparison.    The figures relate to June in the case of salaried employees and tothe last completed financial year for practice earnings.81Barristers13.     The average level of practice earnings quoted for 1955/56 is a weightedaverage of the figures for England and Wales and for Scotland given in the RoyalCommission Report.    The 1967/68 figure has been calculated from a distributionpublished by the Inland Revenue and relates to the Schedle D income of barristersin the United Kingdom, after excluding individual incomes of less than  1,000 onthe grounds that these are likely to be either part-year earnings of practisingbarristers or part-time earnings of salaried barristers.    This exclusion leaves2,420 individuals, compared with 2,333 practising barristers at the end ofSeptember 1967.    The figures relate generally to earnings in the accountingperiods ending in the fiscal year to April 1968: in aggregate they correspondapproximately to earnings in the calendar year 1967.
20.     The 1955/56 fi figures relate to Great Britain whereas the later surveys covered the whole of the United Kingdom.   However, the NBPI survey, when analysed on bothbases, showed no significant difference between the two.Actuaries21.     The 1955/56 survey covered Fellows of the Institute of Actuaries and the faculty of Actuaries.    There were about 740 of these in 1958 (excluding those livingabroad or retired) of whom 550 responded to the inquiry. In November 1968 the institute and Faculty undertook their own survey in order to bring the Royal Commission&apos;s figures up to date, and about 870 (out of 1,000) Fellows provided information on their current earnings.    Some of the respondents worked in the Republic of Ireland but,though their earnings were appreciably lower than those in the United Kingdom, theywere not sufficiently numerous to have a significant effect on the overall average.The medians for individual age-groups have been estimated from grouped distributions.Engineers22.    All the figures relate to corporate members of the Institutions of Civil,Mechanical and Electrical Engineers and cover earnings in the fiscal year.   At thetime of the Royal Commission inquiry there were about 50,000 corporate members, ofwhom about 6,000 actually provided information.    The Engineers&apos; Guild mounted similarsurveys, but with rather smaller samples, for 1959/60 and 1962/63.    The figures for subsequent years are all from the Survey of Professional Engineers undertaken by theCouncil of Engineering Institutions in collaboration with the Ministry of Technologyin 1966 and 1968 and by the Council alone in 1971.    The sample for this survey was similar to that used in the Royal Commission inquiry.    The overall medians for1967/68 and 1970/71 are unpublished and the medians by age have been calculated fromgrouped distributions.Ghemi sts23.    All the figures (including that for 1955/56) are from the Royal Institute ofChemistry&apos;s triennial remuneration survey, which covers all professionally activeFellows and Associates of the Institute.    There were about, 12,500 of these in 1955/56of whom over 70 per cent   responded to the inquiry.    In the case of practice earningsthe figures relate to the fiscal years 1955/56, 1958/59, 196l/62, 1964/65 and 1967/68and to the calendar year 1970.   For salary earnings they relate to the levels currentin May 1956, April 1959, April 1962,&apos; April 1965 and January 1971 and to amountsactually received during the fiscal yearl967/68.    The overall medians, apart from the1955/56 fi gure, have been calculated from grouped distributions.8219.     The third source is NBPI Report No. 71.    This gives salary earnings atSeptember 1967 and practice earnings for the last complete financial year(approximately 1966/67), based on information from about 3,100 registered architects.The figure for employees working outside private practice is from unpublishedinformation.
University teachers25.     The Royal Commission&apos;s figures cover all income, including supplementaryearnings.    The only reliable information on a comparable basis is from a surveyundertaken in November 1969 by the Higher Education Research Unit of the LondonSchool of Economics, who have supplied the figures for the academic year 1968/69which are shown in the table.26.     Movements in average and median salary earnings (excluding supplementaryincome) in universities other than Oxford and Cambridge have been obtained from threesurveys undertaken by the Association of University Teachers in October 1961, 1964and 1967.   As university salary scales were unchanged between 1960 and 1961 the first of these has been taken as the baseline (l00) in calculating the indices.   Exactlycomparable figures for the academic year 1968/69 have been supplied by the higher education Research Unit and these are also included inTable 5.Salary scales27. Table 6 shows movements in a representative selection of the salary scalesgiven in the Royal Commission Report.GENERAL INDICESGraduate salaries28.     The indices of movements in graduate salaries are based on material relating toa few large companies which has been supplied in confidence.    It consists of trendvalues showing the median salaries of graduate scientists and technologists at various ages in 1961, 1963, 1966, 1969, 1970 and 1971 (l January in each case) andof accountants from 1963.    The figures include any bonuses paid to individuals whichare a regular and integral part of basic emoluments.83Physicists24.     The figures relate to Fellows of the Institute of Physics and are fromsalary surveys conducted by the Institute.    The median earnings level from the survey closest in time to the Royal Commission inquiry - that for October 1956 -has been linked to the DE Salary Index in order to calculate indices on the basisof 1955/56 as 79.    Information comparable to that for 1956 is available for March1960 and August 1964 (though the 1960 figures do not take account of back-datedsalary increases for university staffs and the Scientific Civil Service).     more recently the Institute has undertaken surveys (on a slightly different basis) in1968 and 1971 but, from information given in the reports, it is not possible to calculate overall medians.   However, an age analysis for 1971 is available and isshown in the table.
CONFIDENTIAL29.     For each category of graduate in each year, the age-band medians have beenaveraged and an index of change calculated, linking the first available figure tothe DE Salary Index for the previous October.   Allowance has been made (by meansof linked series) for the fact that figures relating to the highest age-band arenot available for 1961.Percentile series30.     The data shown in the first part of Table 7 are derived from Inland Revenuedistributions of annual salaries (for 1964/65 to 1968/69) and of Schedule E(principal source) wages and salaries (for other years).    The two types of datahave been linked by taking the level of salaries at each of the percentile points in the link years (l964/o5 and 1968/69), calculating the percentile point of wagesand salaries corresponding to that level, and applying that percentile point in theyears for which no salary data are available.31.   Since information about low income earners is incomplete, all those whoseincomes fell below the Deduction Card limit in 1955/56 were excluded from the analysis.To produce a comparable coverage over the whole period, this limit was progessivelyupdated by means of the DE Salary Index.32.     The income received by the person at the percentile point was obtained byinterpolating within the appropriate income range by means of the relevant &quot;Paretofactor&quot;, thereby allowing for the slope of the distribution around that point.33.     The Inland Revenue material has been supplemented by data from a salary surveycarried out by the Office of Manpower Economics in January 1972.    This covered morethan 2,500 Board members and senior executives immediately below Board level in 215of the largest commercial, industrial and financial companies.   It analysed salaries in September 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1971 for posts of which the nature and responsibility had not changed materially during the period, together with any bonus,commission or profit-sharing for the previous year.34.     The OME survey gave average changes between September 1969 and 1970, and between 1970 and 1971, at various ranges of salary.   By interpolation between ranges,the change at each of the higher percentile points (0.2 per cent to 5 per cent) hasbeen calculated and these changes have been used to extend the Inland Revenue series.35.     The Department of Employment&apos;s New Earings Survey for April 1970 and April 1971,which has been used to update the lower percentiles of male salaries, covered a 1 percent sample of employees in all industries and services.    It analysed weekly earnings,whereas the Inland Revenue and OME figures relate to annual earnings, and itsdefinition of non-manual workers was slightly different from the Inland Revenuedefinition of salary earners, though similar in principle,36.     Finally, the last two lines of Table 1 show movements since 1955 in the index of Average Salary Earnings (prepared by the Department of Employment) and the ConsumerPrice Index (prepared by the Central Statistical Office).   In each case the publishedindices have been recalculated to give 1960/61 as 100.84
