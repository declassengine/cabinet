IfflS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 72 COPY no. 7 July 1972CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE TO 1976-77Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. In this memorandum I set out a policy and procedure for settling our forward public expenditure programmes this year.EXISTING PUBLIC EXPENDITURE POLICIES2.        Details are in the attached report of the interdepartmentalPublic Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC).    The chart on page 3 shows(top line) the course which public expenditure is now following.    the programmes are larger than those of our White Paper (Cmnd 4829) of last autumn.    This is almost entirely due to developments of policy.PROPOSED ADDITIONS3.        That report also shows (paragraphs 18-20) additions proposed by departments.    Some of these are claimed (the Treasury dissenting) to be within existing policies.    But most would mean new policies.    If all were accepted, they would add over  500 million a year by 1976-77, before taking account of other proposals which may yet emerge from programme analysis and Reviews or similar studies.THE PROBLEM ASSESSED4,        In terms of demand on output, the real cost to the economy of the programmes would then be rising between 1971-72 and 1976-77 at an average annual rate of over 4 per cent.    I think my colleagues will agree that thiswould be too much.(a)       GROWTH /5.        At the present time public expenditure (in real resource terms) andthe Gross Domestic Product are both rising relatively fast (over 5 per cent per annum in each case). * This reflects the measures taken by theGovernment to restore the level of economic activity and reduce unemployment,6,        Once the slack in the economy is taken up the growth of our resourceswill be in line with the underlying productivity of the economy, or growth of productive potential.    Though we have high hopes that this basic factor willrespond well to our policies, it would be wrong to presume success in
advance and to commit resources which are not in definite prospect.    Thiswould be to repeat the mistake which led our predecessors to disaster.7, The rapid rise in public expenditure which is now going on is helping to fill a hole in the economy which has been left by the weakness of private sector demand.    But we cannot expect these conditions to continue for &apos;more than a short time ahead; and in the longer run, as productive investment rises, which is essential for future growth, and as privatedemand generally revives, the growth of public expenditure will have to beslowed down until a more normal proportion has been restored.(b) TAXATION8, We have succeeded up to now in making good our claim that wewould be a tax-reducing Government.    We must not go into reverse on thispolicy.    At the very least our objective should be to ensure that from nextyear onwards we can make a sufficient adjustment of tax rates to offset theincrease in the real weight of personal taxation which would otherwise bebrought about by the automatic effects of inflation.    Even on this basis theproportion of personal income taken in tax would be rising.    Any substantialnet additions would put the achievement beyond reach, ie we would find ourselves having to allow the inflationary *fiscal drag1 to weigh down uponthe personal taxpayer.    I do not think that this would be an acceptableprospect for the Government.(c) BALANCE OF PAYMENTS9.        In looking ahead in this way I have assumed that we will secure our balance of payments position and be able to get the resources into the rightplaces without prejudicing the growth of the economy and the attainment ofreasonably full employment.10.       The action which we have just taken in temporarily floating the Poundis consistent with this assumption.    It does not imply additional scope for reducing the allocation of resources to the balance of payments in order to benefit other sectors, including the public sector.11.        For all these reasons we must not set public expenditure on a course which, with private sector demand recovered, could only be maintained atthe cost of reversing our tax-reduction policy.   This would be to fall intothe same trap as our predecessors, of mortgaging growth before securingit.    This points to our aiming at a rate of growth of public expenditure,defined in terms of resource absorption, no greater than the average annual rate (3.8 per cent) between 1971-72 and 1976-77 of the existing PESCprogrammes.    The total of public expenditure in 1976-77 which this would imply would be  30, 300 million at 1972-73 outturn prices,12.       A rate of increase of 3. 8 per cent would be about \ per cent morethan the corresponding rate in Cmnd 4829, and involves, therefore, somepresentational difficulties which will need to be considered before theWhite Paper.
CONCLUSION13.       I therefore propose -a. that we should adopt as a policy the limitation of the growth of public expenditure as in paragraph 11;b. that, on this basis, the Chief Secretary and I should examine with our colleagues concerned the problems of prioritiesentailed in their proposals for additional expenditure, and reportthe result by the end of September,A treasury Chambers6 July 1972/

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE-GENERAL REVIEWINTRODUCTION1. This report shows the costings of public sectoractivities on the basis of policies as they standnow. It thus provides the base line for decisions on future public expenditure. Ministers will beinvited to settle programmes in the light of thereport; and their decisions will be expressed in the programmes to be published in the annual white paper on Public Expenditure in the late autumn.2. As far as possible the costings have beenagreed between the Treasury and the Departmentsconcerned. Where agreement has not beenreached, the differences are set out in paragraph 20below; but Treasury figures are used in all tabula-tions and in calculations of rates of increase.3. The report takes 1971-72 as a base year(because, although the figures for that year showmore shortfall than had been expected, they are less affected by counter-cyclical expenditure than1972-73). It covers the period to 1976-77. Wherethe Programme Analysis and Review (PAR)studies so far completed have led to changes indepartmental practices, the report incorporatesthese results in the costings. For the periodbeyond 1976-77, apart from the tax credit scheme(see paragraph 21 below), longer term planningwork on individual programmes does not suggestthat public expenditure will increase over the next decade at a pace markedly different from thatforeseen up to 1976-77 unless deliberate decisions are taken to that end.THE PROSPECTSa. Summary4. The main message of this report is that thecost of present policies will be higher and will grow more rapidly than previously planned. Interms of economic effect in the medium term,the prospective balance of available resources and demand suggests a difficult situation in which thegrowth of privately financed consumption will need to be kept in check by some rise, after 1973,in real rates of tax; and a fortiori if any furtheradditions beyond presently agreed policies aremade. Superimposed on this picture is the prob-lem of accommodating the tax credit scheme,which may fall to be implemented shortly afterthe end of the period covered by this report, andwhich could have large implications for bothexpenditure and taxation. This problem is set out vmore fully in paragraph 21 below.b. Rising expenditure . In Cmnd. 4829,0) which contained the lastpublished figures of total public expenditure for(&apos;)&quot; Public   Expenditure   to   1975-76&quot;,   published   inNovember 1971.the period up to 1975-76, the figures given(2)were:1971-72    ......      25,598 million1975-76    ...      ...      28,473 millionimplying an average annual rate of increase in expenditure of 2-7 per cent.6. The 1972 Survey, being a thorough re-costing of policies as they now stand, shows that if thosepolicies remain unchanged, the total will increasemore rapidly. The figures which compare withthose in the preceding paragraph are:1971-72    ......      25,373 million1975-76    ......      29,210 millionimplying an average annual rate of increase of-3-6 per cent.7. The 1972 Survey looks one year further aheadthan Cmnd. 4829, and if the second set of figuresis extended to 1976-77 (still using 1971-72 as the base year), the average annual increase over the six years comes down a little to 3 - 4 per cent.(3)8. Since 1970, therefore, the average annual per-centage change of successive public expendituretotals has varied as follows:Per centJune 1970 in prospect when the present Govern-ment took office (1970-71 to 1974-75)    . 3-3January 1971-Cmnd. 4578(4), embodying theresults of the Governmenfs first review in theautumn of 1970 (1971-72 to 1974-75)    .      .     2-6November 1971-Cmnd. 4829 (1971-72 to 1975-76)as in paragraph 5 above       .      .      .      .     2-7June 1972-as in present Survey (1971-72 to1976-77)     .      .      .      .      .      .      .3-49. The Governmenfs policies will thus involve acourse for public expenditure rising at a slightly higher average annual rate of growth than that in prospect when they took office.10. The following graph compares the presentcostings with both Cmnd. 4578 and Cmnd. 4829,as well as with the position when the government took office. It also indicates the extent to whichcounter-cyclical expenditure affects the figures.(2) Adjusted to 1972-73 estimated outturn prices (in costterms, i.e. including the relative price effect) and excludinginvestment grants, and for the reasons given in Annex A,paragraph 2 refinance for exports and shipbuilding.(3)If one disregards the excess shortfall in 1971-72 (seeparagraph 3), the average annual increase becomes 3-2 percent. If one uses 1972-73 as a base, but ignores the counter-cyclical expenditure in that year, the average annual increasebecomes 3 per cent. In the latter case the inciease islower because 1972-73 includes (apart from counter-cyclicalexpenditure) some deliberately large increases in variousprogrammes which produce a rise of 5 - 7 per cent between1971-72 and 1972-73.(4) &quot; Public Expenditure 1969-70 to 1974-75 &quot;, published in January 1971.

11. The major reasons for the increases since cmnd. 4829 are set out in Annex A. Most ofthe increase is attributable to policy changesannounced since the beginning of the year,including the new Industrial and regional development&apos;) policies, the 1972 uprating of social security benefits, financial assistance to theC1) Cmnd. 4942, published in March 1972.National Coal Board and the Annual farm price Review.12. Within the new annual average of 3-4 percent there is, by conscious policy choice, a sharpincrease in 1972-73 (about 7 per cent) followed,as is shown in Table 1 below, by smallerincreases in the following years but moving up at the end of the period.Public expenditure by groups of programmesTABLE 1  million at 1972-73 outturn prices(including relative price effect)1971-72 to-1976-771971-72    1972-73    1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-77    Averageprovisional estimate   estimate    estimate    estimate   estimate    annualoutturn percentageincreaseDefence and external relations .	3,443	3,534	3,697	3,790	3,898	3,976	2-9Commerce and industry .	1,931	2,598	2,435	2,243	1,955	1,793	0-4(&apos;)Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure.	1,756	1,940	2,024	2,163	2,078	2,145	4-1Environmental services   .      .	4,276	4,764	4,995	5,071	5,177	5,353	4-6Social services       .      .      .      .      .	10,712	11,386	11,763	12,070	12,485	12,987	3-9	1,325	1,566	1,485	1,520	1,560	1,608	3-9Debt interest (2).....	2,400	2,325	2,300	2,275	2,250	2,200	-1-7Shortfall and contingency reserve	- .	-200	-50	100	200	250	Total.....	25,843	27,913	28,649	29,232	29,603	30,312	3-4(0Annual percentage increases in total expenditure (&apos;)    .      .	2-3	7 1	3 1	2-5	1-7	2-9	O These percentages relate to expenditure excluding investment grants and refinance of export and shipbuilding credits.(2) The estimates of debt interest rest on the customary conventional assumptions.c.  Demand on resources13. These new expenditure figures and therates of increase which they involve will need to be presented and defended in public in termsof the demand on output which they imply,because it is only in these terms that it ispossible to assess whether the prospective growth of public expenditure would be acceptable inrelation to other competing claims in the economy private investment, personal con-sumption and the balance of payments. Theaverage annual rate of increase of public expenditure in demand terms for 1971-72 to1976-77 is estimated at 3-8 per cent.(&apos;) this compares with the 3-2 per cent (for 1971-72 to1975-76) in Cmnd. 4829.14. At present the productive capacity of the economy is not being fully used; output is belowproductive potential at high employment. Muchof the steep increase in public expenditure inO The main components of the demand on output are shown in Table 3 on page 8 below.1972-73 (and to a less extent in 1973-74) has there fore been deliberately designed to add to demand and thus to stimulate increased output.The smaller rates of increase in subsequent years would allow for expansion in private sectordemand as recovery gets going and unemploy-ment is reduced from its present unacceptablyhigh level.15. It has so far been the Government^ con-sistent view that the planned rate of growth in public expenditure should in demand termsbe kept, as a matter of prudence, somewhere near the prospective increase in productive potential.With the latter around 3 per cent, an average annual increase of public expenditure in demand terms of 3 - 8 per cent raises the question whetherso steep a rise is acceptable. The medium term economic assessment, based on certain reasonableassumptions about the resources likely to beavailable and the claims of industrial investment and the balance of payments, suggests thatresources prospectively available fall somewhatshort of the amount that would be required (tf)
for the programmes on existing policies as costedin this report and (b) to enable taxation to be adjusted after 1973 (when the recent Budgetchanges will have come into effect) to offset theeffects of inflation on the weight of tax.(&apos;) Thuseven the rate of growth represented by presentspending plans involves a definite risk that it will lead to undue pressure on resources.16. This conclusion relates to the programmes as now costed on existing policies. Furtheradditions (see paragraphs 17-20 below) withoutoffsetting reductions of comparable demandeffect, would of course worsen the prospect.POSSIBLE FUTURE DEVELOPMENTSa. Developments of existing policies17. In addition to the present costings in thisreport, there are certain increases in expenditure which are implicit in existing policies but whichcannot be quantified precisely, or which have notyet been formally approved by the Government.The main items are:i. nationalised industries the amounts of further assistanceneeded by nationalised industries toenable them to deal with the effects of price restraint and recent industrial disputes cannot be determined untilfuture policies have crystallised. Butthey are likely to be substantial.ii. trade and industry the forecasts for the Department ofTrade and Industry in the &quot; Trade,Industry and Employment&quot; heading arelikely to be considerably understatedparticularly in the later years of the survey period. In particular increases will  be  required   for  assistance  to(&apos;)&quot; Offsetting the effects of inflation &quot; here means reducingdirect tax rates (or increasing allowances and thresholds)and increasing specific indirect taxes. It does not meanholding down the personal tax ratio to its present level.individual companies or undertakingsby the Industrial Development Execu-tive; for which the Industry bill provides an initial limit of  250 million(with possible further increases to atotal of  550 million) up till end-1977.No provision is included for new air-craft and aero-engine projects whichmight be approved if Sir RobertMarshall&apos;s recommendations on theaircraft industry are accepted.iii. national training agencyThe proposal to set up a NationalTraining Agency operating selectivegrants schemes could lead to extrapublic expenditure of the order of  25million to  40 million per annum from1973-74.iv. regional employment premiumThe phasing out, instead of a suddencessation, of REP (now running at about  100 million a year) is likely to lead to significant additional expenditurein 1974-75 and possibly in subsequent years, depending on the arrangementsmade.b.  Proposals for additional expenditure18. The expenditure estimates in this reporthave been agreed so far as possible between theTreasury and the spending Departments as an up-to-date recosting of existing policies. But ina number of cases, summarised in the followingtable, the Departments concerned propose thatthe figures should be increased.19. If all of these proposals were approved,the average annual increase in total expenditure over the period 1971-72 to 1976-77 would beincreased from 3-4 per cent to 3-8 per cent(4-2 per cent in demand terms). The cost ofthe developments of existing policies referredto in paragraph 17 above would be additional tothis.Proposals for additional expenditure table 2   million at 1972 Survey prices1972-73        1973-74   (    1974-75        1975-76        1976-77	_	41 +	146+	178-f-	176+	-	up to 45	up to 45	100	200Miscellaneous local services.      .      .      .     v	-	13	31	51	69Health and personal social services	 	25	25	26	27Overseas aid*    .      .      .      ...	n.a.	n.a.	n.a.	n.a.	n.a.	2	4	7	10	12Total (quantified items only)	2	128	254	365	484* Estimates not available.SECRET
20. A brief indication of the individual pro-posals is given below. Fuller detail will befound about most of them in the programmesections in Part 2 of this report.I.    SOCIAL security the Department considers that:(a) Upratings in 1973, 1974 and 1976 should at least reflect the movement in earnings,not prices, adding:  million at 1972 Survey prices1973-741974-751975-761976-7741-4145-9171-5158-0(ft) Maternity and Death Grants should notdecline in real terms after 1975. Thiswould add  million at 1972 Survey prices1975-761976-7718(c) Selective improvements should be allowed for. No estimate of these has been putforward.II. DEFENCE BUDGETNo firm judgment on the appropriate level ofdefence expenditure for 1975-76 and for 1976-77will be possible until the Long Term Costingshave been analysed. Meanwhile, the treasury have proposed that the provisional figure forthe basic Defence Budget for 1975-76 ( 2,903million) should be repeated for 1976-77. TheMinistry of Defence consider that the provi-sional figure for 1975-76 should be increased by 100 million, and that for 1976-77 a provisionalround figure of  3,100 million would morerealistically reflect the requirements of the present defence programmes, an increase of about  200million on the Treasury figure. The Ministryof Defence expect to present claims for addi-tions of up to  45 million in both 1973-74 and1974-75 in respect of expenditure on Malta,Northern Ireland, manpower and the nuclear deterrent.III. MISCELLANEOUS LOCAL services the Departments consider that extra provision should be included for expenditure by localauthorities on improvement of the environment.The additions proposed are as follows:  million at 1972 Survey prices	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77England and Wales				Capital	10 0	20-0	30-0	40-current . .	1-6	8-4	16-0	23-3Scotland				Capital	10	2-0	3-0	4-current	01	0-8	1-5	2-1The capital expenditure additions for Englandand Wales would be applied to the locally determined sector.In making these proposals, the Department ofthe Environment has drawn attention to the impact of policy and estimating changes on the expected expenditure of DOE services as awhole, and Housing in particular, which has produced savings compared with Cmnd. 4829(revalued to 1972 Survey prices) plus expenditureapproved since then as follows:  million at 1972 Survey prices1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76-141	-31	-31	-55The Treasury on the other hand point out thatthese savings result partly from estimatingreductions, and that such savings (other thanin a block budget) are not freely available to departments to permit policy changes.IV.   HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES(a)  Family planning and local hospitals GreatBritainThe Department of Health and Social Securityhas been reviewing policy on family planning and local hospitals as the result of which theSecretary of State will make recommendations tohis colleagues for additional expenditure duringthe period 1973-74 to 1976-77 of the order of 20 million a year for England say,  24 million a year for Great Britain. The usual consulta-tions between the Department and the treasury are beginning as this report is being finalised.(b)  Local authority personal social services-scotland the Department considers that the estimated average annual growth rate for these services,which is appreciably below that for England andWales, should be increased to give the sameestimated rate of growth throughout GreatBritain.  This would add:  million at 1972 Survey prices1973-74	1974-75	1975-76        1976-770-8	1-3	2-3              2-7V. OVERSEAS and the  Minister for Overseas Development hasrecently notified the Chief Secretary that he will propose increases in this programme for con-sideration in the review of public expenditure.
vi.   other programmes(a) education the Departments consider that within existing policies the following expenditure should beadded to the estimates for the building ofspecial schools.  million at 1972 Survey prices	1972	1973	1974	1975	1976	-73	-74	-75	-76	-77England	0-3	1-3	3-3	5-1	6-1Wales .	01	0-3	0-8	1-2	1-scotland	-	 	0-3	1-0	1-6Total    .	0-4	1-6	4-4	7-3	9-1(b) Law and order					There   is	disagreement		between	the	lord chancellor&apos;s Department and the Treasury on whether or not fee income should cover the costs of civil business in the courts; it is the Treasury&apos;view that it should. The increase in net expenditure would be  2 million a year from1972-73 to 1976-77.(c) ArtsThe Department of Education and Scienceconsiders that within existing policies up to 0-8 million a year more should be included within existing policies for the museum andgallery building programme for each of the years1973-74 to 1975-76.c. Tax Credit Scheme21. One further major factor must be borne inmind the possible introduction, shortly after theend of the period covered by this report (e.g. in1977) of the tax credit scheme. On theillustrative figures being used in the preparationof the proposed Green Paper on this scheme, thenet adverse effect of this on the centralGovernmenfs taxation/expenditure balance isestimated as of the order of  1,000 million, with consequential effects on demand. Assuming thatno taxation or expenditure changes are requiredfor short-term conjunctural reasons at the timewhen the scheme is introduced it would then be essential to offset this demand effect either by increased taxation elsewhere in the system and/orby slowing down the rate of growth in public expenditure. Moreover, this process might need to be started in the preceding years in order tomake the problem of introducing the schememanageable. As far as -public expenditure isconcerned, any slowing down of its rate of growthduring that period would need to be planned ata still earlier stage. Ministers will therefore need to keep this in mind in considering the programmes in this report.SECRETCONCLUSION:    THE    PROBLEM    FORMINISTERS22. Before considering the acceptability of anyof the specific items listed in paragraphs 17 to 20,Ministers will wish to reach a conclusion on broad strategy. The main elements in the picture are:(i) Present public expenditure plans involve an average annual increase in public sectordemand of 3-8 per cent.(ii) On the best assessment officials can makeof a trend movement of the economy which would avoid difficulty for thebalance of payments and for private investment such an increase in public expenditure can just barely be accomodated; but:(a) the prospective balance of resources and demand is so finely poised thatsuch a course is by no means free from risk of overloading the economy;(b) privately financed consumption wouldhave to grow by no more than 3 percent a year, significantly less rapidly than public expenditure; and in orderto achieve this  (c) leaving aside changes for short-termreasons, taxation could barely bereduced to the extent needed to offset the net effects of inflation on the taxyield.(iii) The developments of existing policies men-tioned in paragraph 17 and the proposalsfor additional expenditure set out inparagraphs 18-20, if accepted withoutoffsetting reductions elsewhere, would seriously affect the prospects.(iv) Ministers might feel there would be some difficulty in publishing in next autumn&apos;white Paper a planned expenditureincrease higher than that in prospect whenthe Government took office, or oneshowing a sharp rise in the final year.(v) The possible advent of the Tax credit scheme shortly after the end of the period covered by the report means that the planning of both public expenditure andtax remissions must have full regard to theneed for its smooth introduction.23. Ministers collectively will wish to consider these points in arriving at views on:(i) the acceptability of the rate of expendituregrowth now in prospect; and(ii) the additional expenditures for which individual Ministers now seek approval.7

Expenditure on other parts of programmes are in general rising at a lower rate and payments of debt interest, on the conventions used, are shown as declining. But as these other items are of less significance in demand than in expenditure terms, their lower rates of increase have a correspondingly reduced effect in offsetting the increases on items affectingdemand directly.

Annex a comparison with previous costings in Cmnd. 48291. The changes between present costingsand the last published figures (Cmnd. 4829)are shown in Table 6 below in summary formfor the various groups of expenditure pro-grammes.Comparison with Cmnd. 4829TABLE 6   million at 1972 Survey prices	1971-	-72	1972-73		1975-76		Cmnd. 4829	1972 Survey	Cmnd. 4829	1972 Survey	Cmnd. 4829	1972 SurveyDefence and external relations	3,285	3,345	3,319	3,381	3,626	3,645Commerce and industry	1,958	1,847	1,682	2,528	980	1,911Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure	1,943	1,715	1,936	1,898	2,050	2,075Environmental services	4,307	4,193	4,671	4,639	4,983	4,939Social services    .....	10,522	10,501	10,763	11,078	11,648	11,835Other services     .....	1,265	1,274	1,322	1,492	1,405	1,426Debt interest     .      .      .	2,400	2,400	2,375	2,325	2,300	2,250Shortfall    .      .      .      ...	-100	Si	-100	-200	-100	-200Contingency reserve    ....	-	-	125		313	400Total     .      .	25,580	25,275	26,093	27,141	27,205	28,281Total, excluding investment grants and refinance for exports and shipbuilding	25,024	24,833	25,792	26,431	27,163	27,8672. There is one element in these changes whichis essentially a matter of reclassification, beingthe result of the new arrangements for therefinance of export and shipbuilding credits,which accounts for  350 million of the difference in 1972-73 and about  375 million in 1975-76.This refinance was formerly provided by theBank of England and the change does not addeither to the burden on the economy or to theproblem of financing the public sector borrowing requirement. Because its inclusion would distortcomparisons, this expenditure (with expenditureon investment grants) has not been included inthe figures of percentage increases quoted in thisreport or in the analysis in this Annex.3. For 1971-72, 1972-73 and 1975-76 the other changes may be summarised as follows: Fullerdetails are given in Table 7 on pages 13-15 below.  million at 1972 Survey prices	1971	1972	1975	-72	-73	-761.

4. Extra expenditure has been approved in a variety of programmes where most or all of theaddition could be incurred in the assisted areas and completed within a limited period. Someof this counter-cyclical expenditure was incor-porated in Cmnd. 4829. Further additions were approved subsequently, and account for line 1in the above summary.5. The new industrial and regional developmentpolicies (line 2) were announced during theBudget Debate and are designed to stimulateindustrial growth and provide further help tothe assisted areas. Details of the uprating of social security benefits in 1972 (line 3) were also given during the Budget Debate, following the previously announced decision to introduceannual instead of biennial upratings.6. Assistance to the nationalised industries(line 4), to enable them to deal with the effects of price restraint and recent industrial disputes,is partially reflected in the present costings. Theassistance given to the coal industry in 1971-72( 100 million) and an allowance for continuedassistance to that industry in subsequent years( 200 million in 1972-73 falling to  100 million a year in subsequent years), is included in the1972 Survey figures. So is similar assistance in1972-73 to the British Railways Board and national Bus Company ( 34 million) and to theCentral Electricity Generating Board ( 20 mil-lion); but the need for further assistance to these and other industries cannot be quantified at thisstage (see paragraph 17 (I) of the report).7. Of the other policy changes (line 5), theadditional cost of this year&apos;s Annual Farm price review is reflected in the figures for both1972-73 ( 49 million) and 1975-76 ( 42 million).Commitments to assist ICL and other individual companies also affect both years ( 41 million in1972-73;  32 million in 1975-76). Theprogramme of purchase and resale of land for private housing will add to total expenditure in1972-73 (by  35 million) but reduce it in 1975-76(by  40 million). However, the figures for1975-76 also reflect increases on road mainten-ance ( 24 million), Surface transport ( 31 million)and Housing ( 36 million).8. Estimating changes (line 6) for 1971-72represent the extent to which actual expenditurein that year is now thought to have fallen short of the planned level. Some shortfall was alreadyanticipated in the planned totals.   But there appears to have been underspending amountingto a further  319 million arising mainly fromlower indeed negative stock building in the nationalised industries; and from the continua-tion of housing investment at a reduced level.For later years, the overall estimating changesresult from the recosting of existing policies inall programmes, but continue to be dominated by revisions to the estimates for housing invest-ment (with reductions of  130 million in 1972-73and  147 million in 1975-76) and for nationalised industries capital expenditure (reduced by  114million in 1972-73 but increased by  40 million in 1975-76).9. In the annual White Papers, the size of the contingency reserve is inflated by the transfer toit, for presentational reasons, of provision forreal increases in social security upratings.Excluding this provision, the reserve in Cmnd.4829 for years 4 and 5 (1974-75 and 1975-76)was  297 million and  313 million respectively.It is proposed in this report that the comparableprovision for years 4 and 5 which now become1975-76 and 1976-77 should be increased to 400 million and  450 million (with consequen-tial adjustments for the earlier years). On theother hand, it is also proposed to increase the allowance for shortfall, in the light of experience in 1971-72, from  100 million to  200 million ayear. The net effect of these changes, as shownagainst contingency reserve/shortfall allowance(line 7), is produced in the following way.  million1972 1973 1974 1975 1976-73    -74    -75   -76   -77Contingency reserve in cmnd. 4829 (excludingsocial security element)    125    212   297   313This report      .      .    -     150   300   400   450Change since Cmnd. 4829 -125 -62 -1-3 -1-87Shortfall (increased from100 to 200) . -100 -100 -100 -100Total change in contin-gency reserve/shortfallallowance .      .      . -225 -162  -97 -1310.

The figures for the Defence Budget are made up of three components:(i) The &quot; basic&quot; Defence Budget, which represents, for 1972-73, 1973-74 and1974-75, the allocations agreed in 1970,adjusted upwards only for improved Armyrecruiting, together with provisional figuresfor 1975-76 and 1976-77.(ii) Short-term increases to stimulate employ-ment. These are the accelerated ship-building programme, provision for whichwas reflected in the allocations published in Cmnd. 4829: and orders for Nimrodaircraft, Bulldog and Jetstream traineraircraft, runway repair vehicles and machine tools, all of which were agreed too late for inclusion in Cmnd. 4829 (andwhich are shown as policy changes).(iii) The additional costs of siting certainDefence Establishments in one placerather than another for regional reasons.These increases, too, were agreed too latefor inclusion in Cmnd. 4829, and are^alsoshown here as policy changes.2. The figures are calculated on the conventionemployed until last year by which the defence budget was charged for Army and aerospaceequipment on delivery, progress payments beingmade to suppliers from the Ministry of defence and Ministry of Aviation Supply Purchasing(Repayment) Services Votes which formed partof the Other military defence programme.Following the recommendations of the white paper on Government organisation for defence procurement and civil aerospace (Cmnd. 4621),payments to suppliers are now being made direct from the Defence Budget. Although the pro-gramme will remain unchanged, the previousallocations will have to be adjusted to reflect therephasing of expenditure on that account. Thisadjustment was made for 1972-73 as part of thepreparation of Estimates, and it is reflected in thefigures for 1972-73 in the Table above (and shownas an estimating change). Full adjustment forthe later years cannot be made until the pro-cessing of the Defence Long-term Costing is complete.3. The Defence Secretary has entered reserva-tions, which the Cabinet have noted (CM (71)50th Meeting on 19 October 1971) in respect ofNorthern Ireland, Malta and increased recruit-ment, for which he has said he may need to propose additional expenditure later. He hasfurther recorded his view that it will not bepossible to provide for the maintenance of thepresent level of strategic deterrence in the face of growing Russian defences within present defence budget forecasts.CONFIDENTIAL130648A 2
4. Of the annual totals set out in the above table,that for 1972-73 is the current year&apos;s defence budget Estimates revalued to 1972 Survey prices.5. The figures for 1973-74 and 1974-75 are theDefence Budget figures published in Cmnd. 4829,revalued to 1972 Survey prices, plus the additions referred to in paragraph 1 (ii) and (iii)above.6. The figure for 1975-76 is the provisional estimate published in Cmnd. 4829, revalued to1972 Survey prices, again plus the additions inparagraph 1 (ii) and (iii) above. Its adequacy willbe further examined in relation to the planneddefence programme.7. The figures for the four years 1972-73 to1975-76 are also adjusted for the rephasing since cmnd. 4829 of expenditure on the acceleratedshipbuilding programme. These adjustments areincluded as estimating changes.8. No judgment on the appropriate level ofdefence expenditure for 1976-77 will be possibleuntil the 1972 Long-term Costings have beenanalysed. This will in due course enable adecision to be taken on the Defence Budgetallocation in relation to these costings and other claims on public expenditure. In the meantime the Treasury have proposed that the provisionalfigure for the basic Defence Budget for 1975-76should be repeated for 1976-77. The Ministry ofDefence considers that this gives a misleading impression of the requirements of the present defence programme which would be morerealistically reflected by a provisional round figureof  3,100 million.2.

This heading covers military training assist-ance which provides for courses in the UnitedKingdom for the service personnel of othercountries, the provision of British service trainingteams on loan or secondment to developing(mainly Commonwealth) countries, and a small amount of police training, particularly in South-East Asia. It also covers the cost of capital equipment supplied to a few countries. provision is included for assistance to security forces in thePersian Gulf. The British Naval Mission hasbeen withdrawn from Libya and no newsubsidised training in the United Kingdom isbeing provided for Libyans.   Following on theDefence Secretary&apos;s offer to help Malaysia, anincrease in the numbers of loaned British service personnel is under consideration.2. The need for military aid, in particular theprovision of loaned British service personnel and capital equipment, fluctuates and new require-ments cannot be forecast.Allied services . The main items are the cost of accommoda-tion for Ministry of Defence headquarters staff,superannuation for the Ministry&apos;s civilian staff,and HMSO and COI services (stationery and recruitment publicity).
United States military aircraft4. Final deliveries of aircraft have beencompleted. Payments were still being made in1971-72 to cover support costs and final settle-ments, and they are shown under &quot; Purchases &quot;.5. These payments were covered by UnitedStates credit facilities which were treated asreceipts and not shown in the public expenditure figures.6. The repayments of the credit facilities areborne on the Defence Budget. As the payments(not offset by the credits) have already appearedunder Other military defence the payments fromthe Defence Budget would represent doublecounting; to avoid this offsetting reductions are shown under &quot; Repayments &quot; in Other militarydefence.7. These credit facilities terminated at 31 March1972; thereafter purchases will be paid for directly from the Defence Budget.3.

The adjustment (line b.) represents the differencebetween the two figures.1. Overseas aid expenditure covers the UnitedKingdom official aid programme and the balanceof net investment abroad by the commonwealth development Corporation (CDC). The figuresabove are shown net of amortisation and at constant (1972 Survey) prices in accordance withthe new practice announced in Cmnd. 4829 of controlling and announcing the official aid pro-gramme on this basis. Total overseas aid, on anet basis, counts towards the UNCTAD^ 1 percent target which the Government has undertakenthat the United Kingdom will do its best to reachby 1975.2. The 1971-72 total for the aid programmerepresents an increase of  17-8 million overCmnd. 4829 revalued, of which  7-1 million(together with a further excess of  15 million per-mitted in 1972-73) is to be carried forward as anoffset to the years 1973-74 to 1975-76.3. The aid programme totals for 1972-73 to1975-76 have been initially revalued from thefigures in Cmnd. 4829. The programme for1972-73 has been increased by  10 million to take account of the burden of relief for Bangladesh.Because of other pressures on the programme,excess expenditure in the year up to  15 millionhas been authorised against later offset. Thisexcess expenditure and the  7-1 million carried forward from 1971-72 is deducted by three equalamounts from the programmes authorised for theyears 1973-74 to 1975-76.
4.  The effect of these arrangements is as follows:1971 1972 1973 1974 1975-72     -73     -74     -75     -76Basic programmeCmnd. 4829revalued   .      . 226-4  245-2  257-0  280-1   305-9Increase agreed . 10-7 10-0      Further excess to becarried   forward and its attribution 4-7-1 +15-0  -7-4   -7-4  -7-3Resulting modifiedprogramme totals  244-2  270-2  249-6  272-7  298-65. The total for 1976-77 maintains the 9 percent rate of increase of the previous two years on the initial Cmnd. 4829 revalued totals, althoughthe planned rate of progress as set out in cmnd. 4829 and maintained for 1976-77 is some-what affected by the bringing forward of theincrease for some of the years.6. The Minister for Overseas Development hasrecently notified the Chief Secretary that he will propose increases in this programme for con-sideration in the review of public expenditure.7. In 1972-73 it is expected that, of the grossplanning figure (which on the basis of previous experience is higher than the Estimate provision to allow for under-spending), about &apos;61 per cent and 13 per cent would be devoted respectively tobilateral capital and multilateral aid, about 18 percent to technical assistance, nearly 4 per cent tothe CDC, and about 4 per cent to the pensions of former members of the Overseas Services.8. The allocation of the aid programme for subsequent years is reviewed annually, and the forecasts for even the coming year may be variedin the course of the year. The following para-graphs are illustrative by reference to 1970 and1971.9. The main recipient of multilateral aid is theInternational Development Association. other international institutions receiving contributionsinclude the United Nations Development Pro-gramme and other United Nations aid and reliefagencies, as well as some regional developmentbanks. In 1971, 11 per cent of our official aidwas multilateral. A similar proportion went onmultilateral aid over the five-year period 1967 to1971.10. In 1971 nearly 90 per cent of bilateral capitalaid and technical assistance went to Common-wealth countries including the remainingDependencies; of which just over one-thirdwent to the Indian subcontinent and a similarproportion to Commonwealth Africa.11. Of bilateral capital aid in 1971, nearly three-quarters was in the form of financial loans, andjust over one-quarter in the form of grants. Themajority of the loan commitments were interest-free. The purpose or function of bilateral aid is best described in relation to a run of years, sincethe chance incidence of commitment and rate ofexpenditure may distort the annual pattern. Overthe five-year period 1967-71 commitments ofproject aid totalled  422 million, of which 14 percent was for renewable natural resources includingagriculture, 33 per cent for economic infrastruc-ture, and 16 per cent for investment in social services. Over the same period, commitments ofnon-project aid totalled  345 million, of which13 per cent was budgetary aid, 65 per cent for current imports, 13 per cent debt refinancing, and5 per cent for disaster relief.12. Technical assistance financed bilaterally in1970 included the provision of over 15,000 expertsand teachers and 2,000 volunteers for overseas service, and the education in the United Kingdomof nearly 8,000 students and over 4,000 trainees.

The estimates cover contributions to theCom-munity Budget, the European Coal and steel community and the European Investment Bank.The investment of  24 million in the reserves ofthe European Coal and Steel Community will bemade in three equal instalments starting from thedate of accession. The paid up subscription to capital of the European Investment Bank will be 37-5 million, to be paid in five equal instalmentsduring the 2\ years after accession. The UnitedKingdom will also make a contribution to the reserves of the Bank, estimated at  20 million,also in five equal instalments beginning on1 January 1973. The remaining element consists of our contribution to the Community Budget.2. The figures up to 1975-76 are the same asthose in the last White Paper on Public Expendi-ture, Cmnd. 4829 (which were in turn based onthe estimates in the White Paper &quot; The UnitedKingdom and the European Communities&quot;,Cmnd. 4715). No change has been made to thefigures to arrive at the 1972 Survey price basis.The main factor affecting revaluation is the move-ment of farm prices in the Community in relationto world farm prices, and no significant adjust-ment appears to be necessary on that account.The figure for 1976-77 is derived from theestimates in Cmnd. 4715 in the same way as thefigures for the earlier years. v3. Sufficient information is not yet available tocarry out a comprehensive re-assessment of theestimates made in Cmnd. 4715. The e.c.

It is not therefore possible to make any satisfactory newestimate of the likely increase in administrationcosts in the enlarged Community. There are alsouncertainties about the consequences of the recentincreases in agricultural prices on the community budget as well as about the size of Communityexpenditure from the European Social Fundfollowing changes in the rules governing its operation and on regional policy, which is currently under review within the Community. Afull reassessment of the Cmnd. 4715 figures should, however, be possible in advance of thepreparation of this year&apos;s White Paper on public expenditure.Overseas representation4. This expenditure includes the cost of theForeign and Commonwealth Office in London,British diplomatic and consular representation inmore than 120 countries, and official delegations to seven major international organisations. it covers the cost of staff (excluding those engaged on information work) as well as their office and private accommodation abroad, and official travel.It also includes the cost of the Overseas Develop-ment Administration, the Passport Offices inLondon and other centres, and the communica-tions organisation in support of the diplomatic service.Overseas information5.  This covers three main elements:(a) British Council expenditure to promotewider knowledge of the United Kingdomand the English language abroad and to
foster cultural relations with othercountries. The remainder of the Council&apos;expenditure is included in Overseas Aid.(b) The cost of the BBCs External Servicesand associated expenditure involved inBritish broadcasting directed to othercountries.(c) The cost of information staff at home andabroad and their operational expenses andof supporting services of the Central Officeof Information and the Stationery Office.6. The figures for 1972-73 to 1975-76 representexpenditure limit totals agreed by Ministers. they include about  5 million of the additional provision of  6 million over a period of four years for the expansion of cultural relations with europe, announced in Parliament by Mr. Ripponon 6 March 1972. As part of this programme theBritish Council&apos;s activities in Europe will be expanded at an additional cost of about  3-5 million over four years; also as part of this programme the Foreign and commonwealth office will allocate about  1-3 million over thesame period to promote exchanges, visits and conferences with Europe, and the BBC will receive an annual increase of  35,000 in their programme funds to promote broadcastingexchanges with Europe.Other external relations7. This item consists mainly of expenditure onthe Secret Service, certain Overseas service pensions and international commitments andsubscriptions, including the United Kingdom&apos;sassessed contributions to regular budgets ofUnited Nations organisations and of the Organisa-tion for Economic Co-operation and Development,the Council of Europe and the North atlantic treaty Organisation (secretariat costs). Whileevery effort continues to be made to contain therate of expansion of such budgets, the forecasts ofassessed contributions payable are based on themost realistic assumptions possible at this stage.Provision continues to be made for the voluntarysupport of the United Nations Force in Cyprus.There is no significant overall change from thelevel of expenditure forecast in Cmnd. 4829.5.

The format for showing expenditure on agri-culture has been revised this year. For the first time, an attempt has been made to reflect in the forecasts the pattern of expenditure after we join the e.c. in 1973. This means both a differentarrangement of the figures and also a substantial increase compared with Cmnd. 4829. Theincrease is due mainly to the 1972 Annual ReviewAward, but also in part to the new assumptionson which these projections of expenditure duringthe transitional period have been based, whichmay overstate the likely level of expenditure.:AfSA-A v.- &quot;AJ-i A: A&apos; ^V;&apos;- y&apos;Y:&apos;&quot;;v&apos;;:&apos; &apos;V.:y. A2. During the transitional period (1973-78) we will gradually be adapting our system, in con-formity with the negotiated agreements set out inthe Treaty of Accession (Cmnd. 4862), to conform to the common agricultural policy (CAP). Forthe main CAP products our existing system of guaranteed prices and deficiency payments will bebrought to an end, and replaced by a system of support based on higher market prices, importlevies and intervention buying. The quinquen-nium covered by the 1972 Survey therefore showselements of both systems. The level of agricul-tural support which will be appropriate in futureover and above that provided by end prices underthe CAP has yet to be considered. ministers may, therefore, decide on different policies fromthose assumed in this report for the projectionsin items i, ii and iv to vi.CONFIDENTIAL 	4-74-9	4-42-6	4-42-5	4-42-4 :	4-4-7	4-40-1	4-73-4	4-58-1-60	4-6-0	4-12-0	4-2-7	4-3-6482-5	471-5	409-5	362-0	363-2Line i3. The Treaty requires us to raise UnitedKingdom market prices to e.c. levels by sixsteps between 1973 and 1978. We are also required to end deficiency payments as soonas possible, but may retain them during the transitional period if we wish. Expenditure onthese deficiency payments must therefore end by1978 at the latest, but it would be open to ministers to phase them out before that. Thepublic expenditure White Paper of January 1971(Cmnd. 4578) envisaged savings of  150 million in total deficiency payments by 1974-75 (i.e. those covered in line iv as well as line i) to be achieved by raising prices by means of import levies. Butthis was before the completion of the negotiationsfor entry, and although the Cmnd. 4829 figuresembodied this assumption, it is no longer realisticto assume savings of this magnitude. Theprojections this year are based on the arbitraryassumption that deficiency payments will be phased out eyenly over the whole of the transitional period, with the implication that thelevel of guaranteed prices will also be raisedgradually during the period. But if ministers should decide to phase out deficiency paymentsmore rapidly, the expenditure in line i would decline more rapidly.Line ii4. This item covers certain production grants and subsidies which may be subsumed into end9
prices. It is not certain whether it will bepossible to continue these under the CAP, nor have Ministers yet taken decisions about whetherit would be desirable to do so. Meanwhile, thefigures reflect a phasing out of the lime andfertiliser subsidies and ploughing grants, buta continuation of other production grants at theirpresent level.Line Hi5. This is intended to represent the gross cost of market intervention operations in the UK. Theexpenditure (with the exception of administrative costs) will be refunded from the EuropeanAgricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund(EAGGF). The figures this year do not constitute an independent estimate but are based on the data used in compiling the projections of receipts from the e.c. included in the White Paper,&quot; The United Kingdom and the european communities&quot; (Cmnd. 4715), adjusted to aBritish financial year basis. It has beenpostulated that the cost of market supportoperations will be the same as receipts from theGuarantee Section of EAGGF plus theadministrative costs of the intervention agency.Line iv6. This shows a continuation of deficiency round on certain agricultural products towhich the CAP does not apply potatoes, wool,sheep and eggs.Lines v and vi7. These cover all the other agriculturalprogrammes. They have been divided into thosewhich may qualify for assistance from theEAGGF, and those which are likely to remainwholly the responsibility of the Exchequer.Fisheries8. The main expenditure under this headingrelates to subsidies for the fishing industry and grants and loans for new vessels and equipment.Future expenditure on these depends on operatingresults and on the plans for capital investment which may be made by the industry. Neithercan be forecast with accuracy.Forestry9. This item includes both State forestry and grants to the private sector. The figures make no provision for any change in policy following thecurrent review of forestry. They include anestimate of the increasing value of State-ownedforests, taken as equal to the Commission^ net cost of forestry operations; this is included as ameasure of the change in the value of stocks.This net cost includes compound interest on pastgrants in aid, as well as the grant in aid for theyear in question. The cash requirement decreasesgradually over the quinquennium but the mean isabout  15 million. It is expected that the figures will be considerably revised when the Governmenttakes final decisions following the recent review.6.

Department of Trade and industry. The Department^ estimates are now presented in a different form. The changes reflectmainly the establishment of the IndustrialDevelopment Executive and the accompanyingchanges in regional policy and policy for indus-trial support announced in Cmnd. 4942.2. The first stage of the current PAR of support to Industry is focused on the advanced tech-nology industries which account for an important part of the Department^ programmes.Industrial Development Executive3. Provision is made for expenditure by theIndustrial Development Executive on the newregional development grants and on regionalselective assistance which will, in part, replaceassistance under the Local Employment Act.The Industry Bill,now before Parliament,containspowers for these and also wider powers to giveselective assistance to industry at the national level. The latter power is subject to an overallfinancial limit (which may be increased by Order)of  250 million for the period to 31 December1977. Expenditure under this power may rise to 50 million a year or more, but this has not been included in the figures in Table 7 except for theassistance to International Computers Ltd., whichwould be given under this power.regional development grants4. Grants will be made towards the cost of buildings and plant and machinery in the specialdevelopment areas and the development areas,and towards the cost of buildings in the enlargedintermediate areas and, for a period of two yearsonly, in the derelict land clearance areas. Thefigures are inevitably tentative at this stage.expenditure under the local employment act5. The forecasts take into account the running down of most of the forms of assistance availableto industry under the Local Employment Act1972. The forecasts are based on the continuingdevelopment of industrial estates and provisionof factories at much the same level of expenditure as previously envisaged, but other forms of assist-ance under the Local Employment Act 1972 areexpected to have virtually terminated by the endof the forecast period.selective regional assistance6. Provision is made for loans and other formsof assistance to industry in the development areas and intermediate areas.assistance to the shipbuilding industry7. The new Industrial Development Executivehas been instructed to carry out a review ofGovernment strategy towards shipbuilding. Theresults of this may have implications for expendi-ture, but these cannot be taken into account now.Construction Grants8.  50 million over the Survey period isprovided for payment of tapering grants on ships under construction up to 1974, as set out in cmnd. 4942.Assistance to Individual Companies9. The forecasts provide in 1972-73 for afurther  0-6 million to the liquidator of UpperClyde Shipbuilders Ltd. and  20 million forassistance to Cammell Laird over the period1972-73 to 1974-75. Provision is also madefor  29-2 million assistance to Govan Ship-builders Ltd. over the period 1972-73 to1975-76. None of the amounts included underthe heading was contained in Cmnd. 4829.Refinancing of Home Shipbuilding Credit10.  Provision is now made in the Surveys forthe partial refinancing of the banks&apos; advances inconnection    with    the    Shipbuilding    CreditGuarantees.Other11. Repayment of loans issued by the Ship-building Industry Board and those issued underthe Shipbuilding Credit Act; and receipts of premiums on shipbuilding guarantees are con-tained in this heading. For 1970-71 and1971-72 only there is also expenditure on loans and grants by the Shipbuilding Industry Board.Increases over Cmnd. 4829 arise from rephasingof loan repayments.selective national assistance12. This expenditure is discussed in paragraph above. The provision of  100 million made over the Survey period for support to ICL isbased on the Company&apos;s proposals which are currently under consideration.assistance for mineral exploration13. Because of continuing uncertainty aboutthe rate at which assistance will build up the forecasts for assistance under the MineralExploration and Investment Grants Act 1972have been included at the Cmnd. 4829 revaluedlevel but must be regarded as tentative at thisstage. Expenditure under the Act is likely to bev reduced as a result of the introduction of regional Development Grants.tourism  [including  assistance  to  the  HotelIndustry in England)14.  The forecasts provide for continued support to the British Tourist Authority and the English
Tourist Board, including expenditure inEngland of    million a year on the limitedscheme of assistance to tourist projects in theDevelopment Areas announced in Cmnd. 4516,and grants and loans to the hotel industry inEngland under part 2 of the Development of tourism Act, 1969. Total expenditure under the hotel scheme is now forecast at a lower level than in Cmnd. 4829, revalued but rephasingproduces an increase of  2-3 million in 1973-74.The case for further assistance for the tourismindustry, particularly in the Development Areas,is being studied.national film finance corporation15. The forecasts assume that advances of 1 million will be made in 1972-73. The future arrangements for the Corporation are, however,under review.minor industrial sponsorship programmes16. This covers small-scale support of theengineering and other industries, in particular the machine tool and computer industries. Mainmethods of support are preproduction purchases of advanced machine tools and other equipment;R and D contracts in various fields of advanced technology, including contracts with ICL; andsome advisory and productivity services. Con-tracts with industry are normally on a costsharing basis; advisory and demonstrationservices are required to become self-supportingover varying periods of time. Increases overCmnd. 4829 are mainly due to the inclusion of 5 million for the purchase of machine tools forfurther education establishments agreed as partof a number of measures to assist the machine tool industry.assistance to small firms17. Provision is made for the continuation ofthe Industrial Liaison Service over the survey period (on a 100 per cent funding basis after1972-73). The future of the service is, however,under review and it may be replaced by other measures of assistance.residual expenditureInvestment Grants18. The forecasts provide for expenditurearising from contracts entered into by industrybefore 27 October 1970. The total expenditurequalifying under these contracts and the phasing of the payments are still uncertain. The mainvariations from Cmnd. 4829 are a reduction in1971-72 and an increase in 1972-73 resultingfrom slow submission of fully documentedclaims.Industrial Investment Schemes19.   There   are  two  schemes,  the  computersmerger and assistance to the aluminium industry,contained under this heading.Residual expenditure of the Industrial Reorganisa-tion Corporation20. The forecasts allow for outstanding liabilitiestaken over from the Corporation and for loanrepayments and realisation of assets. A more rapid realisation of assets is expected than wasforecast in Cmnd. 4829. The main variation is adecrease of about  10-5 million in 1975-76.Civil Aviation Servicesgrant to the civil aviation authority21. As explained in the recent White Paper on civil aviation policy guidance (Cmnd. 4899), theGovernment will pay a grant-in-aid to the- CivilAviation Authority to meet its prospective deficit on revenue account. The aim is to reduce thisgrant progressively, with a view to terminatingit by 1977-78. The Survey thus provides for agrant of  24 million in 1972-73, declining to 10-4 million in 1976-77; this reduction in thegrant (and its eventual termination) dependprimarily on international agreement to adequateincreases over the period in charges for theprovision of en route navigational services.Compared with the provisional figures given in cmnd. 4829, there are increases in the grant-in-aid for the earlier years of the period because ofrevised higher forecasts of staff costs, and also ofthe allocation of work between the Authority andother programmes; however, by 1975-76 theseare more than offset by receipts which are now expected to rise faster than had been expectedearlier.capital   expenditure   by   the   civil   aviationauthority22. Because of the acceleration of purchases ofcertain equipment (undertaken for employmentreasons), and also a reassessment of the needsof the National Air Traffic Services, the fore-casts are  14 million higher than was estimated in Cmnd. 4829.local authority expenditure on aerodromes23. There are increases of  3 million to 4 million a year over the period 1973-74 to1975-76 mainly due to expenditure on a newairport terminal complex at Birmingham inconnection with the proposed National exhibition-tion Centre, and to a new freight complex at manchester airport.  :
dti expenditure on civil aviation24. There are reductions in expenditure from1972-73 to 1974-75 resulting from the transferof Edinburgh (turn house) Airport to the BAAand of Bahrain Airport to the Bahrain Govern-ment. Reductions in receipts from 1972-73 to1975-76 are due to earlier sales of land in theUnited Kingdom than was expected, and to lossof revenue from operations at Bahrain Airport.Aircraft and Aero-Engine Projects and Assist-anceconcorde25. Compared with Cmnd. 4829 the Concordeestimates show a reduction in real terms of 21-9 million in 1972-73 and  17-3 million in1973-74, whilst 1974-75 and 1975-76 showincreases of  1 million and  49-6 million respectively. These changes reflect increaseddevelopment costs and slippage in theproduction programme.26. The latest estimate of the joint Anglo-French development costs shows an increase from  885 million to  970 million (equivalent to 963 million at 1972 Survey prices) of whichthe United Kingdom share is  480 million. this estimate is, however, based on the assumptionthat the Certificate of Airworthiness will begranted in December 1974. United Kingdomofficials consider this unlikely and the Survey is accordingly based on a United Kingdomdevelopment cost of  493 million, which allows for certification in June 1975. But the forecastdoes not contain any provision for additionalengine development which may be necessary toreduce noise and improve performance; theUnited Kingdom share of this further work couldbe in the region of  25 million.RB 21127. The forecasts provide for the completion ofthe development of the basic RB 211 engineand for meeting the net losses which thecompany will incur on the existing orders for555 engines. Compared with Cmnd. 4829 thereare increases of  6-7 million in 1972-73 and 5-9 million, in 1974-75, and reductions of 2-9 million in 1973-74 and  13-3 million in1975-76. These changes result from delays,which have led to a rephasing of productionexpenditure, and from the advance in April 1972of  6-2 million to enable Rolls-Royce (1971) Ltd.to repay a Euro-dollar loan which they hadincurred for the Air Holdings offset purchase ofLockheed Tristars. The Survey provides for most of this advance to be repaid, by instal-ments, in later years. It is possible that therewill be further changes in these estimates follow-ing a current review of the programme.assistance to rolls-royce (1971) ltd.28. Provision of  10 million for working capitalhas been made in 1972-73. Further working capital may be required but cannot be quantifiedat this stage. No provision has been made forthe balance of the purchase price of Rolls-Royceassets, for which  30 million down payments were made in 1970-71.general r and d programme29. This covers work in industry, universities and MOD (PE) aviation establishments in respectof civil aircraft, including engines, avionics andother equipment. Major items include thereduction of aircraft noise and the study of futureaircraft types, including Short Take-off and landing.30. The principles which determine the cost-sharing of work which benefits both defence and civil programmes are currently being reviewedbut it is not yet known whether this will havean effect on the estimates.other31. The heading includes terminal payments in1972-73 on existing launching aid projects;provision for the M45H engine; commercialexploitation receipts in respect of past launchingaid projects and miscellaneous items. There aredecreases from 1973-74 onwards, mainly due toestimates of receipts being at a higher level thanin Cmnd. 4829 revalued. In 1972-73 theincreased receipts are almost offset by anadditional  3 million for the M45H originallyincluded in 1971-72.32. No provision has been made for support for civil aircraft and aero-engine projects whichmay be approved if the recommendations in Sir Robert marshals report on the aircraft industry are accepted.Spacenational space technology programmeSatellite technology R and D, etc.33.  Provision is made for R and D on satellitetechnology, for the development and launching ofthe X4 technology satellite, and for terminalpayments on the Black Arrow programme.Large applications technology satellite programme34. The estimates provide for a development programme of large applications technologysatellites using foreign launchers: Ministers havenot yet taken decisions on the programme.international programmes35. The expenditure consists almost entirely ofthe UK&apos;s contribution to the ESRO programme on the development of applications satellites for
aeronautical, meteorological and telecommunications-tions purposes. From 1975-76 onwards the contribution levels out on the basis that the costof the full ESRO programme will be held within70 million accounting units a year. The cost ofwork in industry on behalf of ELDO is coveredby receipts from the Organisation.Nuclear energy and other nuclear expenditureNUCLEAR REACTOR R AND D36. The major reactor projects and the future organisation of the nuclear industry are underreview. Pending decisions by Ministers the forecasts provide for continued development ofthe Fast Reactor and the Mark III (HighTemperature) Reactor.LOANS (NET) TO BRITISH NUCLEAR FUELS LTD.37. The extent and timing of this expendituredepends to a large extent on the Central electricity generating Boards&apos; forecasts of nuclear fuelrequirements, changes in which also affect the forecast of receipts from sales of uranium ore bythe sea (included in paragraph 37 below).There are increases over Cmnd. 4829 of 13 million and  6-6 million in 1973-74 and1974-75 respectively and a decrease of 6-8 million in 1975-76; these reflect thedifficulties of forecasting under this heading.OTHER R AND D, URANIUM ORE TRANSACTIONS, ETC.38. This includes other nuclear, and non-nuclearR and D by the Atomic Energy Authority, muchof which is on repayment. It also includes theAuthority&apos;s transactions for the supply of uraniumore; approved Government support to BritishNuclear Fuels Ltd. on the Tripartite Centrifugeproject; and minor nuclear expenditure.Reductions in 1972-73 and 1973-74 and increases in 1974-75 and 1975-76 are mainly dueto changes in receipts from uranium ore sales toBNF Ltd. resulting from a revision of theGenerating Boards&apos; requirements.Other research and developmentINDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ESTABLISHMENTS39. Provision is made for the Department&apos;s threemulti-purpose establishments (National PhysicalLaboratory, National Engineering Laboratory andWarren Spring Laboratory) and two morespecialised establishments (Laboratory of theGovernment Chemist and Safety-in-MinesResearch Establishment). Reductions on theprovisions in Cmnd. 4829 up to 1974-75 and anincrease in 1975-76 are mainly due to areassessment of the establishments&apos; computerrequirements.confidential industrial RESEARCH ASSOCIATIONS40. The forecasts for grants are at the same level as in Cmnd. 4829. A continued rundownthroughout the period has been assumed, basedon the policy of stiffening grant terms as they come up for review.NATIONAL RESEARCH DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION41. The forecasts provide for interest relief granton the first eight years of advances made underthe Development of Inventions Act 1967. Noadvances of capital are expected to be requiredby the Corporation over the Survey period.OTHER42. The main items under this heading areterminal assistance to the hovercraft industry,limited to a total of  2 million as approved by ministers, and work on marine technology in areas where long-term benefits to UK industry and tothe national economy are foreseen.Export promotion43. Provision is made for the export promotionprogramme for which the British Overseas trade board has now assumed direction. Pending theBoard&apos;s review of the programme in the light ofthe PAR Report expenditure is forecast tocontinue at about the present level. Furthersupport for the National Exhibition Centre isunder consideration by Ministers. The forecastsinclude between  0-2 million and  0-1 million ayear for the Technical Help to Exporters scheme.Shipping services44. Most of the expenditure is directed towardsimprovement of safety at sea. There are increasesover Cmnd. 4829 of the order of  1 million a year,the main single cause being additional expenditureon civilian air sea helicopter rescue services toreplace services formerly provided by the armed forces. Higher expenditure is also anticipated fordealing with oil pollution and on improvementsfor navigation in the English Channel.Nationalised industries special assistanceASSISTANCE TO THE COAL INDUSTRY45. The forecasts are based on the continuation of the various measures of assistance under present legislation (covering the period to31 March 1974) including the extension of the redundant mineworkers payments schemes beyond1972, as approved by Parliament in SI 335 of1972. The forecasts are of necessity tentativesince expenditure depends on the size of manpower rundown. The provisional outturn for1971-72 includes  100 million for an emergencygrant paid to the National Coal Board to prevent17
their accumulated deficit for that year exceeding the permitted limit. Ministers have agreed that further major assistance to the industry will berequired. Provision has therefore been made of 200 million in 1972-73, and  100 million a year for the remainder of the Survey period. However,neither the method nor size of the support is yetdecided and the figures are therefore necessarilysubject to considerable uncertainty.compensation for acceleration of investment46. Provision is made for payments to theElectricity Boards in England and Wales and tothe Gas Industry in respect of compensation forthe acceleration of investment for employmentreasons. The estimates are tentative since finaldetails of payments have not yet been worked out.other47.  20 million has been included in 1972-73 inrespect of compensation to the Central electricity generating Board arising from their additional expenditure on certain exceptional operations,including uneconomic firing and additional coal imports, necessitated as a result of the mine-workers&apos; strike.Miscellaneous expenditure and loan repayments48. The main items of expenditure under this heading are support for the British standards institution and the Design Council; the cost ofcivil emergency oil stocks; and the UKcontribution towards setting up the proposedEuropean Patent Office ( 0-3 million in 1975-76and  1 -4 million in 1976-77). Several repayments of loans are also included.Administration49. Provision covers the staff and expenses of theDepartment, including the Industrial DevelopmentExecutive, the Patent Office, the monopolies commission and the Metrication Board.Department of Employment and other Depart-mentsEmployment services50. This comprises expenditure by the Depart-ment of Employment and by local authorities on services (including the Youth employment service) for which the Department makes grants;and expenditure by the Department of the environment on premises for government training Centres and Industrial RehabilitationUnits. The main items of expenditure aredepartmental administration (including theemployment exchanges, Government TrainingCentres and the Factory Inspectorate), training and rehabilitation schemes and services for theseriously disabled. .51. The increases compared with Cmnd. 4829reflect primarily the further expansion in theindustrial training programme and enhancedfinancial assistance for transferred workers.52. The placing service for adults, whichoperates through rather more than 1,000 local offices and which is designed to help job-seekersto find employment and employers to find workersmore rapidly and effectively than they otherwise would, is to be modernised as set out in &quot; people and Jobs &quot;. The decision to charge fees for therestyled Professional and Executive Register hasbeen taken into account. The forecasts also make provision for the expansion of the factory inspectorate and a reassessment of the workarising out of the Industrial Relations Act.53. Government sponsored vocational training isprovided at present mainly through government training Centres where about 16,600 personsreceived training in 1971, mainly in skilledoccupations. It is now expected that thenumber of training places will be. expandedfurther to achieve a throughput of 34,000 by1975-76 within the new Training OpportunitiesScheme which is to be developed from the presentVocational Training Scheme. To make this possible the number of training places will rise from 11,780 at 1 April 1972 to 15,462 by April1973 and to a possible 20,300 by 1977. provision has also been made for an estimated 10,500training places in Colleges of Further education in 1973-74, 13,500 in 1974-75 rising to 15,000 in subsequent years; this compares with the figureof 2,000 provided for in Cmnd. 4829 and reflects the expected increase in demand for the wider range of courses of training as proposed in&quot; Training for the Future &quot;. In addition continueduse is to be made of spare training facilities inemployers&apos; establishments and the provision for ,000 training places each year is rather morethan twice the Cmnd. 4829 numbers. Furtherconsideration is being given to the size of the programmes in each sector under the TrainingOpportunities Scheme.54. Proposals have also been made for theintroduction of a National Training Agency andfor revised functions for Industrial TrainingBoards, and for phasing out the levy/grant systemof finance. Boards at present are financed bylevies on the industries they serve, but receivegrants from the Department for fostering certain types of training particularly in development andv intermediate areas. Forecasts will need to be revised when consultation has been completed andfirm decisions, about levy/grant taken.55. Improvements have been made to theemployment transfer scheme with the object of improving the mobility of workers, particularly those in assisted areas and ex-Governmeritsponsored trainees.
Redundancy Fund payments56. Through rebate payments to employers the redundancy Fund meets part of the total amountpayable to employees under the redundancy payments Act. Where the employer is in financial difficulties the full amount is guaranteed.Payments out of the Redundancy Fund, whichis financed by Employers&apos; contribution collectedthrough the national insurance stamp, are administered by the Department of Employment.Forecasts take account of the current level ofunemployment and are based on past and currentexperience of demands on the Fund. The schemeis at present the subject of a PAR.57. SET additionalwith effect from  1SET additional payments and regional eniploy-ment premiumpayments were abolishedApril 1970 but becausepayment is made in arrears small provision ismade for belated claims in 1972-73. The regional employment premium, which is paid in respectof manufacturing establishments in development areas, will be phased out from September 1974in a manner and over a period yet to be decided..In the meantime payments are forecast to continue at least into 1975-76.Covent Garden Market Authority58. This expenditure relates to the move of themarket to the Nine Elms site.Refinance of export credit59. Provision is now made in the Surveys forpartial refinancing of the banks&apos; advances inconnection with export credit.Miscellaneous services60. This item includes most of the expenditureof the Development Commission and theexpenditure of the Highlands and IslandsDevelopment Board; also the grants to theScottish and Welsh Tourist . Boards, including their expenditure in Scotland, and Wales on the hotel loans and grant scheme and the subsequentscheme of assistance to tourist projects in development areas.BP rights issue61.

The capital expenditure programmes of the nationalised industries account for about 7 percent of all public expenditure. The programmes are normally designed to meet the demands frompaying customers for the products or services ofthe industries in the most economic way. How-ever, as announced by the Chancellor of theExchequer in the House of Commons on23 November 1971, the Government has requested the industries to advance expenditure on certaininvestment projects for national economic reasons(see paragraph 5 below).Shortfall2. Experience shows that capital expenditure bythe nationalised industries taken together fallsshort of the total of approved programmes.Industries are asked to prepare their estimates ona realistic basis; and it should therefore berecognised that expenditure by individual industries may exceed their estimates, and that itmay be necessary to approve additional expendi-ture in such cases. Nevertheless, for theindustries together an allowance for shortfallmust be made. In the light of recent experience,the allowance has been set at  100 million in eachyear.Sale of assets3. The shipping assets of the National freight corporation were disposed of last year; and progress is being made with the sale of the assets of the Transport Holding Company (includingThomas Cook&apos;s). Allowance for these sales hasbeen made in the figures in Table 12. The british steel Corporation are also proceeding with thedisposal of some of their peripheral interests.Comparison with Cmnd. 4829, revalued4. The underlying programmes (i.e. beforeallowance for the acceleration of investment projects) show in aggregate a reduction on theestimates in Cmnd. 4829.   In &apos; particular, the
estimates in Cmnd. 4829 of expenditure on fixed assets in 1972-73 and 1973-74 amount afterrevaluation to  1,915 million and  1,921 million respectively (in both cases after deduction ofshortfall). The comparable figures, apart fromacceleration, would this year be  1,741 million and  1,839 million. The reductions, of about 170 million and  80 million, are a consequenceof the lower than expected rate of economic growth achieved in 1971-72. (This, and theminers&apos; strike led to a substantial reduction in stocks in 1971-72, reflected in the estimatingchanges.)

The NCB&apos;s activities comprise mining(collieries and open cast), ancillaries (e.g. coke ovens), trade undertakings and participation inoffshore prospecting for hydrocarbons.2. In the aftermath of the miners&apos; strike in theearly months of 1972, the figures for investment in mining are necessarily provisional. The pro-gramme will be appraised when the NCB producerevised proposals, taking the strike and its reper-cussions into account. Decisions by Ministers onenergy policy as a whole and on the reconstruction of the NCB&apos;s finances will have a significantleasing arrangements has reduced public expenditure on fixed assets by an average of about 25 million a year over the Survey period(including 1971-72) as compared with Cmnd.4829.5. The acceleration of investment projects hasadded  84 million to planned expenditure in1972-73 and  88 million in 1973-74, thus largelyoff-setting the reductions mentioned in paragraph above. The resulting pattern of expenditure onfixed assets shows a gradual rising trend over theperiod from 1971-72 onwards, interrupted only in1975-76.  million at 1972 Survey pricesH-2 0      4-43-0      4-50-2     -23-6      -26-9-90-6      +10-4      +19-5    +148-2      4-52-7875-7       847-5       826-8       783-0       861-6bearing on the course of coal production andtherefore on required levels of mining investment.3. Given the present uncertainties there seems no justification for departing from the Cmnd. 4829investment levels for mining. The mining figures are basically those of Cmnd. 4829 revalued at1972 Survey prices and rounded to the nearest 5 million. An additional  10 million has been added to the figure for 1972-73 in view of theneed for special investment to make good damage to pits and equipment caused as a result of theminers&apos; strike.4. The non-colliery part of the programme is agreed by Departments to be on a realistic basis.1970-71	1971-72	1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77outturn	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn					83-0	95 0	960	900	940	790	69 0463-0	439-0	475-0	475-0	482-0	504-0	585-014-6	17-2	270	31-5	44-5	53-1	49079-5	79-0	84-8	65-9	54-4	49-9	56-7218-7	171-2	175-2	205-9	182-6	157-1	140-0858-8	801-4	858-0	868-3	857-5	843-1	899-7-23-4	-17-8	-18 1	-170	-16-2	-16-4	-14-4835-4	783-6	839-9	851-3	841-3	826-7	885-331-4	3-5	61 0	45-2	66-3	60-7	57-7866-8       787-1       900-9       896-5       907-6       887-4       943-0
Investment in ancillaries is broadly in line withthe figures in Cmnd. 4829, revalued, apart from asmall increase in 1974-75 caused by an expectedrise in smokeless fuel and coking activities.Investment in trade undertakings remains at a token  1 million a year throughout the period.There are however significant changes in thefigures for offshore exploration decreases of 3-5 million and  3 million in 1971-72 and1972-73 respectively, and increases of  9 million, 16 million and  9 million in 1973-74, 1974-75and 1975-76 respectively. These increases reflect the award of further licences early in 1972 to theNCB and their partners, with consequentialexpectations of additional exploration in the newfields, together with further development in existing fields and in a field which may be acquired from another licensee. The figures make no allowance for the award of further licences tothe NCB and their partners in the future.Electricity Council and Boards (England andWales)5. The necessary level of investment in electricity generating capacity is determined by the forecastlevel of simultaneous maximum demand (SMD)for the sixth and seventh winters ahead (i.e. whencapacity started in year one is planned to comeinto service); by the margin of capacity judgednecessary to provide for variations in actual fromforecast demand, breakdowns, etc.; and by the allowance made for delays in the planned comple-tion of plant. This year&apos;s demand forecast by theElectricity Council shows a significant reduction on last year&apos;s forecast SMD for the winter of1977-78 (55,000 MW.) is only 1,000 MW. higherthan last year&apos;s forecast for the winter of 1976-77and 1,400 MW. below the previous forecast for1977-78.6. Such a reduction in forecasts of demand would normally lead to lower expenditure. How-ever, the acceleration of the order for the1,000 MW. power station at Ince, announced on23 November 1971, together with higher provisionfor conversions (see paragraph 7 below), have produced a level of expenditure somewhat above that in Cmnd. 4829, revalued.7. The figures in Table 8 give an estimate of thecost of existing policy on the basis of a planningmargin of 20 per cent of SMD. Cmnd. 4829estimates were based on a planning margin of17 per cent of capacity to be built in excess ofpredicted demand but difficulties with new plant vand construction delays have meant that the availability of plant at peak periods has fallen wellshort of the 90 per cent average assumed whenthe 17 per cent margin was adopted by theCentral Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) in1964. In addition, the development of off-peakloads has meant significantly longer periods of high demand, so that a given risk of failure tomeet peak demand would imply more frequentand longer periods of load shedding. TheElectricity Council thus adopted in 1971 a plan-ning margin of 20 per cent, and it is the view ofthe Department of Trade and Industry that the perpetuation of a 17 per cent margin would implythe acceptance of an eventual diminution in thepresent level of the security of supply.8. Because of the substantial consequences for public expenditure of an increase in the planningmargin, the DTI will be preparing for Ministersa full evaluation of the risks and costs entailed by different margins. The decision as to a par-ticular level of planning margin will necessarily be related to Ministerial decisions on the future of energy policy in general and on the developmentof nuclear power in particular. However, this isnot an immediate issue for decision in the presentSurvey. The figures for the CEGB contained inTable 8 assume a planning margin of 20 per cent,but if a margin of 17 per cent had been adopted the estimates proposed for the industry for1974-75, 1975-76 and 1976-77 would need to bereduced by  5 million,  30 million and  50million respectively. The consequences for employment in the heavy electrical industry ofsuch a reduction would need to be borne in mind.9. The slow rate of increase in demand for electricity, and the larger margin of generating capacity over demand which now exists and islikely to continue for some years, make it unlikelythat the industry will wish to order another power station (apart from Ince) in 1972-73; and thefigures make provision for only one new power station in 1973-74. The figures in Table 8 make no allowance for the possibility that in order toassist the heavy electrical industry to maintain its capacity the Government would request theCEGB to place an early order for a non-nuclear power station. The Board would undoubtedlywant financial compensation from the Govern-ment as a condition of agreement. It is unlikelythat there would be a further order for a nuclear power station before 1974.10. The CEGB have made provision for the con-version of several power stations (totalling9,000 MW. capacity) to be able to burn natural gas or oil as an alternative to coal. Currentplanned expenditure over the period totals about 85 million of which three-quarters falls in theperiod up to and including 1974-75. Whetherall the planned expenditure will be requireddepends not only on the result of the GasCounciTs Ekofisk negotiations but also on the outcome of Ministers&apos; consideration of energypolicy. The programme may therefore needrevision; meanwhile, the Treasury and the DTIagree that full provision should be included.
11. The figures in Table 8 take account of the acceleration of investment projects at Governmentrequest. Apart from Ince, this acceleration hasincreased expenditure in 1972-73 and 1973-74 byabout  8 million and  9 million respectively, with consequent reductions in subsequent years.12. The programmes for the Area Boards havenot yet been finally assessed by the Department ofTrade and Industry. Even with the increaseresulting from accelerated investment projects, theArea Boards&apos; estimates are expected to showreductions on the provision included in Cmnd.4829 revalued. This is due to the continuedreduction in short-term demand forecasts whichhas resulted in the deferment of certain schemesof system reinforcement as the expected loadincreases have failed to materialise.Scottish electricity1. Although they are separate statutory bodies,the NSHEB and SSEB plan and operate theirgenerating systems as one. Last year, it wasagreed that the North Board should build a power station of some 1,260 MW capacity tomeet demand in and after the winter of 1977-78in NE Scotland. Delays in reaching a decisionon the type of station mean that it cannot nowbe brought into commission before the winter of 1978-79. Because of reductions in the fore-cast of demand for electricity in Scotland, this isnow acceptable; but further deferment could notbe accepted without an unjustifiable risk to supplies.2. A decision on the type of station will betaken in the light of the nature and timing of decisions on nuclear policy. The figures in the table assume that the station will use the Steam-Generating Heavy Water System; but the boards have made it clear that they would not be willing to use such a system unless it were chosenas an approved system for Great Britain, and theGovernment gave guarantees of financial backing.Otherwise, they would wish to build an oil-firedstation. This would have a substantially lowercapital cost; and because greater reliability couldbe assumed in its early years of service the installation of other generating plant could be postponed, with consequent further reductions inthe expenditure shown in Table.3. The programmes of the Boards are otherwisesubstantially the same as shown in Cmnd. 4829.There are some small increases in the SouthBoard&apos;s programme mainly due to technical and safety improvements at power stations. Inaddition, the acceleration of investment projectsat Government request has increased forecastexpenditure in 1972-73, 1973-74 and 1974-75 by 5-7,  7-8 and  0-6 million respectively, with corresponding reductions of  2-2 and  9-2 mil-lion in 1975-76 and 1976-77.   These figures include the acceleration of a turbo-generatingset (No. 3) in the Inverkip power station togetherwith the minimum associated transmission.Gas Council and Boards1. The industry&apos;s planning continues to bedominated by the need to market substantial quantities of natural gas. It expects, on thebasis of existing reserves, to take an average of4,700 million cubic feet a day (mcfd) in 1975-76and 4,900 mcfd by 1976-77, compared with ,200 mcfd in 1971-72.2. The cost of converting appliances to burnnatural gas (about  330 million at outturn pricesover the review period) is not included in Table 8,but is reflected in the industry&apos;s gross tradingsurpluses. This conversion operation is an essen-tial part of the natural gas programme and hasbeen optimised both financially and economically,using operational research and other techniques.3. The programme of expenditure on fixed assets, before allowance for accelerated invest-ment projects, shows reductions throughout theperiod on the corresponding figures in Cmnd.4829 revalued. This is a reflection of improvedforecasting techniques and careful control ofcapital expenditure, due to the greater role beingplayed by the Gas Council in the planning of theindustry&apos;s investment. Departments agree that because of these developments it would not be justifiable to impose further reductions for possible slippage, despite the industry&apos;s ratherpoor record of forecasting in recent years.4. The acceleration of investment projects atthe request of the Government has increased expenditure by  5-0 and  5-4 million in 1972-73and 1973-74 respectively, and reduced it by  7-2, 3-7 and  0-7 million in 1974-75, 1975-76 and1976-77 respectively.5. It is clear that on current plans the industry will need further supplies of natural gas, beyond those available from known fields, for sale in and after the later years of the review period.However, the source of such supplies is not yet known: possibilities are gas from the Ekofiskfield in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea,imports of liquefied natural gas, or manufactureof substitute natural gas. Each would requireadditional capital expenditure within the reviewperiod; but amounts and timing would differ. Allthat can be stated with certainty is that some additional expenditure on fixed assets will be incurred. It has therefore been decided that an allowance of  25 million should be included inthe figures for each year from 1973-74 onwards.This allowance will be subject to revision whenmore knowledge is available about the source of future supplies of gas.

The provisional outturn for 1971-72 for expenditure on fixed assets was  245 millioncompared with the approved level of  266 million.The Corporation now estimates that its expendi-ture in 1972-73 will be  259 million. the changes in &quot; other capital expenditure &quot; in those two years relate mainly to a fall in stocks of  92million in 1971-72 following a downturn intrading, intensified by the effect of the coal strike.Stocks are expected to rise in 1972-73 as theCorporation^ output improves.2. Provisional approval of expenditure on fixed assets in 1973-74 of  200 million ( 220 million at 1972 Survey prices) was announced by theMinister for Industry on 8 May 1972.   Thefigures in Table 9 for later years are also provi-sional being those provided by the BSC in itsfive-year projections for the years 1972-77. Theyare consistent with the capacity range announced by the Minister for Industry on 8 May. Theydiffer (though not significantly) from those in cmnd. 4829 revalued which were purely anextension of the figures proposed by the BSC for1972-73. No final decisions on future capacity orthe overall level of investment have yet been takenbut the BSC has further work on this in hand.Conclusions from this are expected to come tothe Government in the summer, together withspecific development proposals for new capacity which may include a major new development,further expansion at existing plants or a combination of the two.24CONFIDENTIAL1

The total figures are higher than those in cmnd. 4829 revalued by  49 million over thefive years to 1975-76. This increase, as it relates to fixed assets, is made up as follows:Telecommunications (increase)Posts (decrease) ....Giro and Remittance Services (increase)Data Processing Service (decrease)  million88-234-70-518-42. The telecommunications investment pro-gramme accounts for over 90 per cent of thetotal Post Office figures for the five years to1976-77 and the amount estimated for 1976-77is about 25 per cent more than for 1971-72. Theprogramme within the United Kingdom includes provision for conversion of the few remainingmanual telephone exchanges to automatic work-ing; extension of subscriber trunk diallingfacilities to all customers; an addition of overseven million new exchange connections over thenext five years; augmentation of trunk routes to relieve traffic congestion and to meet growth in long-distance calls; and to provide for growth ofconnections to the telex service and in dataterminals. Assuming also the effects of furthertariff increases it is estimated that the waitinglist can be brought down from its present levelof over 200,000 to about 40,000 by March 1976.Decisions are to be taken within the next 12months on what type of equipment should beadopted as standard for large local exchanges,and on the rate of replacement of obsolescentStrowger equipment; the present programmemakes no allowance for the effects of these decisions which would not in fact be felt before1976. At the request of Ministers a further review is being undertaken with the Post Officeof other possibilities for meeting growing demandincluding increasing investment and the shorten-ing of lead times for the planning, construction and installation of exchange equipment.3. Expenditure on Posts will be mainly directed to replacement of obsolescent buildings and vehicles and the installation of the automaticsorting equipment required under the plans formechanisation of the letter and parcel services.The essential feature of the letter plan is to makethe fullest use of code-sorting machinery, by concentrating sorting work in a greatly reducednumber of mechanised offices. This in turn willsimplify the present complex circulation system and is expected to make possible substantialmanpower savings. The parcel plan is broadly similar in concept. Investment in Posts is how-ever lower than in Cmnd. 4829 because the PostOffice has curtailed its proposed expenditure whilereviewing these plans, to take account of a currentfall of about 10 per cent in mail traffic. the review is expected to be finished later this year.CONFIDENTIAL25
4. The Government has announced that the Girowill continue in being, with a target to breakeven by 1976-77, and tariff increases have beenput to the Users&apos; Council with a view to introduc-tion on 1 July 1972. (The Post Office will infact aim to make the Giro break even by1974-75.) The Giro&apos;s progress towards this goalwill be monitored by officials. No capitalexpenditure is included for Remittance (money and postal order) Services.5. The Data Processing Service provides com-puter services both for the various Post Officebusinesses and for other customers. The PostOffice decided last year however that for the timebeing it would no longer engage in computerservices for other customers apart from its exist-ing commitments and utilisation of spare capacity,and the effects of this decision were incorporated in Cmnd. 4829. The reduction in expenditure onfixed assets compared with Cmnd. 4829 is dueto the cancellation of a number of specificschemes for the telecommunications business which are now considered to be uneconomic andthe rephasing of others.11.

BOAC are planning to buy a further 13Boeing 747s for replacement and expansion.This investment is similar to that allowed for in cmnd. 4829, but considerably lower than was planned early in 1971 because the Corporationreacted to the down-turn in world civil aviationby cutting their investment plans during the summer. Since then there have been a few morereductions in subsonic investment, including the *postponement for a year of the purchase of oneBoeing 747; these reflect boac&apos;s continuingefforts to avoid over-capacity.2. The estimates also allow for the purchase offive Concordes and related equipment, at a totalcost of  115-5 million. The bulk of this expendi-ture is now expected to fall in 1974-75, althoughit was earlier thought that it would be spreadmore evenly over the Survey period. these assumptions are, however, very tentative. BOACrecently put in a firm order for five of these aircraft. Three will be sufficient for the north atlantic route and the use of the further twodepends on unresolved factors such as thequestion of supersonic over-flying in Australiaand Africa.British European Airways3. Deliveries of Trident 3s, which account forthe high level of expenditure in 1971-72 will
continue during 1972-73. BEA&apos;s future plans for aircraft procurement will depend on the british airways Board decision on whether or not tointroduce Airbuses. BEA&apos;s current thinking isthat, in order to remain competitive, they will need to introduce Airbuses in 1975 or 1976, butthey are still studying which type would suitthem best. The main change since Cmnd. 4829 isdue to revised estimates and rephasing from theearlier years into 1975-76 and 1976-77 of Airbusinvestment and the associated equipment.British Airports Authority4. BAA is planning to spend nearly  84 million at its three London airports and at Prestwick.Almost all of this sum will be at Heathrow andGatwick, and the investment is justified by the expected build-up of traffic before the third london Airport at Maplin can be operational.The Authority has also provided for  8-4 million on developing the airport at Edinburgh subjectto planning permission and land acquisition;about three-quarters of this will be contributed by DTI under the agreement which transferredownership of the airport to BAA.5. The estimates also include expendituretotalling  50-6 million at Maplin.  The propor-tion of this sum which will fall to BAA will depend on decisions on the methods of financing the Maplin project.Maplin Airport6. The planning of Maplin Airport and the related developments is still at an early stage and it is not yet possible to give an estimate oftotal expenditure on the project. As well as the 50-6 million for the reclamation of land and building of the airport, which is at presentincluded in the BAA programme, the Surveyincludes  18 million in the British railways board programme for a rail link to London.Some preliminary expenditure on other aspectsof the project could be accommodated withinthe relevant programmes, such as roads and research. There are, however, two majorexpenditures which are as yet unquantifiable.First, the proof and experimental establishment at Shoeburyness will have to be moved, but costscannot be established until the precise location of the new site is determined. Second, no deci-sion has yet been taken on the new local govern-ment structure which will be needed and, as aresult, no estimate can be made of the likelycosts of the infrastructure and urban development.12.

1. Expenditure by the surface transport industries on fixed assets shows a reduction of 189 million over the period 1971-72 to 1975-76compared with Cmnd. 4829 revalued. Some 125 million of this is due to the British railways board (BRB) decision to lease rather thanpurchase certain of their assets. Also the BRBand the National Freight Corporation have cutback their investment plans in the face of adversetrading conditions, which have led todisappointing financial results.British Railways board. The strategy studies begun last year are notyet complete, and the figures for the later yearsmust be regarded as provisional, although mostof what is now proposed for the early years willbe needed whatever strategy is chosen. In par-ticular the programme for the replacement of oldtrack by continuously welded rail is going aheadfaster than originally planned. Provision hasbeen made for a major re-signalling project onthe Midland line from St. Pancras. investment in new locomotives and rolling stock is alsoplanned and from 1974-75 onwards includes provision for a major part of the BRB&apos;s plannedproduction of High Speed Diesel Trains.Expenditure on London and the South Eastcommuter services (which is again included underthe infrastructure heading) will increase from 17-4 million in 1971-72 to  28-0 million in1976-77.3. The figures include provision for expenditure by the Board on rail links with the ChannelTunnel ( 27 million) and a new line linkingLondon with the proposed Maplin airport ( 18-million). On current plans the spread of expendi-ture would be:  million	1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77Channel tunnel		10	9 0	17-0Maplin link	10	3-5	5-5	80In each case the Board&apos;s investment will dependon policy decisions about these projects and notonly on the normal criteria for railway invest-ment. The figures are very uncertain.4. The increases set out in the previous two paragraphs are more than offset by the reductionsmentioned in paragraph 1.British Transport Docks board. The level of investment in new port facilities is largely dependent on customer demand. Thebulk of the firm plans which the Board have are for developments at Southampton, Hull andSouth Wales.British Waterways Board6. The future of the British Waterways board is uncertain. It is Government policy to transfer responsibility for the Board&apos;s waterways inEngland and Wales to the new Regional water authorities. Separate arrangements will be needed for waterways in Scotland. As it isimpossible to forecast how, if at all, the Authori-ties may modify the tentative plans for capital investment made by the Board, the provisionremains the same as last year, revalued to 1972Survey prices.Transport Holding Company7. The THC is to be dissolved following thesale of Thomas Cook and Son Limited. some provision has been made for minimum, essentialinvestment and a purely notional figure has been included to allow for the proceeds of sale ofCook&apos;s.National Freight Corporation8. The NFC expenditure, in respect of theirsubsidiary road haulage companies, NationalCarriers Limited, and freight liners Limited,mainly relates to the replacement of vehicles and provision of terminal facilities.National Bus Company9. Almost all the proposed investment is for new buses suitable for one-man operation.Scottish Transport Group10. The established pattern of capital expendi-ture by the Group is continued. Approximately60 per cent of their programme is for the replacement of buses. Most of the remainder isfor the introduction by 1975 of roll-on/roll-offvehicle ferries on both major and minor routes and the corresponding provision of terminals;this should have important effects on theefficiency and profitability of the services.

1. Expenditure on roads covers construction,improvements, maintenance and lighting of:(a) major roads, i.e. motorways, trunk and principal roads; and(ft) other roads and car parks.Expenditure on new construction and improve-ment of major roads (including lighting) and on maintenance and lighting of motorways and trunk roads is either financed wholly by the government or subject to specific Government grants. Main-tenance of principal roads (including lighting) andall expenditure on other roads and car parks is alocal government responsibility and is Govern-ment assisted only through the rate support grant.It is not subject to central control except in the context of the overall limit on capital expenditure for locally determined projects imposed under theterms of DOE Circular 2/70 (116/70 welsh office). It cannot therefore be estimated with thesame accuracy as the expenditure financedspecifically by central Government.2. New and improved roads are essential tocater for the prospective growth of traffic. Thetotal number of vehicles licensed has risen from9j million in 1960 to 15^ million in 1971 and isexpected to continue to increase to about22 million by 1980. Without a substantial pro-gramme of road improvements, congestion and itsassociated economic and social costs would increase significantly throughout the 1970s. InScotland and Wales congestion is less serious, butthe programmes in these countries are aimed atmodernising the most heavily used routes.3. The expenditure figures in the Table reflect the extra spending on the infrastructure measures announced in July, on the measures announced inNovember 1971, and the accelerated expenditureon certain types of strategic routes announced in cmnd. 4942 &quot; Industrial and Regional Develop-ment&quot;. Total roads expenditure over the period from 1972-73 to 1976-77 shows an average annual increase of 7-5 per cent. The provisionfor 1976-77 represents an increase of 6-8 per cent over 1975-76.England4. The programme provides for the implement a-tion of the proposals announced by the Secre-tary of State for the Environment in June 1971to provide a modern trunk road network of 3,500miles, of which 2,000 miles would be motorway,by the early 1980s. It also includes the rephasingof expenditure necessary for the acceleration of selected road schemes to improve access to theEast Coast ports announced in Cmnd. 4942,acceleration of &quot; Marshall&quot; work on the mainten-ance of trunk roads and of principal roads. all this work will also benefit the employment situation.5. The overall increase proposed from 1972-73to 1976-77 is 8-1 per cent a year. The increase between 1975-76 and 1976-77 is 6-7 per cent.Within these figures expenditure on the road programme proper (new construction and improvement of motorways, trunk and principalroads) is to grow by about 11 per cent a year.The higher rate of increase in the Road Pro-gramme is largely due to the previous pattern of commitments and expenditure some over-spending in the past followed more recently byunderspending. The Road Programme has to be planned over a longer period than five years andany humps or hollows have to be seen in thatcontext.6. Local authority capital expenditure on roadsfalling in the locally determined category underDOE Circular 2/70 is expected to grow by about  per cent a year on average. There is no direct control by central Government over the the distri-bution between services of locally determinedcapital expenditure, but roads expenditure in1970-71, the first year of the operation of the newprocedures under the Circular, suggests that the continuing level of expenditure on that servicemay be higher than assumed in the Surveyestimates.7. Local authority current expenditure on roadsis expected to grow by an average of 5-6 percent a year. This progression reflects the levels ofexpenditure used in determining the last rate support Grant but it also has regard to policy changes for raising the standards of road main-tenance.8. There is no direct control by central Govern-ment over the distribution between services of either the locally determined capital expenditureor current expenditure but it is expected that if on roads either exceeds the estimates in the survey this will not affect the planned totality oflocal authority expenditure.Wales9. By comparison with Cmnd. 4829 revalued thefigures show an increase of  9 million over theyears 1972-73 to 1973-74 resulting from the government&apos;s reflationary measures announced inNovember 1971. An increase of  3 million in1974-75 and  5 million in 1975-76 will enablework to proceed on the westward extension of theM4 motorway as agreed by Ministers and announced in Cmnd. 4942: &quot;Industrial and regional Development&quot;.10. Total expenditure is planned to grow by anannual average of 6-4 per cent over the period from 1972-73 to 1976-77. The 1976-77 pro-vision is an increase of 9 - 8 per cent over 1975-76.
Scotland11. The figures are consistent with the policy setout in the White Paper, &quot; Scottish Roads in the1970s &quot; (Cmnd. 3953). Because difficulties havedelayed the planned starts of schemes in the early years of the decade some rephasing of theexpenditure shown in Cmnd. 4829 on the con-struction and improvement of trunk and principal roads has been made. Mainly becauseof the development of North Sea oil additional expenditure of  1 million in 1975-76 and 3 million in 1976-77 is included for the accelerated improvement of the main trunk routesserving N and NE Scotland. From 1972-73allowance has been made for additional trunk road maintenance work arising from therecommendations in the Marshall committee report but no provision has been made for thefinancial implications of the Report on mainten-ance expenditure on local authority roads whichcannot presently be assessed.12. Between 1972-73 and 1976-77 total expendi-ture is planned to increase by an annual averageof 4 - 2 per cent. The 1976-77 provision is 6 - 3 percent above the 1975-76 figure.14.

The Government provides a wide range offinancial assistance to public transport. Somegrants, such as the unremunerative railway servicegrants made to the British Railways Board(BRB), bus fuel grants and rural bus and ferrygrants, are made to help sustain existing transport services. The value and effectiveness of this typeof support has been the subject of a PAR, which indicated that there might be advantage in due course in  altering the balance  between the
different forms of support. Other grants, suchas infrastructure grants, are aimed at improving the public transport services provided by national-ised industries and local authorities in commuterareas.2. This year the decision by the Governmentthat the nationalised industries should conform to the Confederation of British Industries (CBI)initiative on price restraint and the decision to accelerate investment for employment reasonshave led to the payment of special grants to theBritish Railways Board and the National bus company under the provisions of the Transport(Grants) Act 1972. As a result there is a signifi-cant increase in 1972-73 over Cmnd. 4829revalued. There are also increases in later yearsbecause of a larger provision for infrastructureexpenditure.Support to Nationalised Transport industries british railways board. Grants are made to the Board to cover their losses on uprofitable passenger services retained for social or economic reasons. The total levelof grant is assumed to remain constant in real terms. This means that increases in real net costs will have to be covered by operating economies and/or closures. Because of price restraint theLondon and South East commuter network willnot now be commercially viable by 1973-74 as was planned; and no new assumption can yet bemade about the date when viability may beachieved.4. The Transport (Grants) Act 1972 providedfor a special grant of  27 million in 1972 to put the Board in a position to meet their statutoryfinancial duty, while at the same time responding to the CBI initiative on prices. The Act also provided for grants, which will total  2-6 million over the period, towards the extra cost to theBoard of bringing forward certain investment soas to stimulate employment. However, limitingtheir fare increases to 5 per cent in 1972 willhave a continuing effect on the Board&apos;s finances.They cannot, for marketing reasons, return atonce to the fares levels which would have obtained in 1973 in the absence of the CBIinitiative and there is therefore likely to be a need for further special assistance of some kindin 1973 and perhaps beyond. But the size and nature of such assistance will need to be decided in the light of the rail strategy studies.national freight corporation5. The 1968 Transport Act provided for thepayment of up to  60 million in grants to theNFC over the five years from 1st January 1969.The final payment of  3-7 million in 1972 will mean that only  41-1 million of the possible 60 million has been needed.CONFIDENTIALlondon transport board6. Responsibility for London Transport was transferred to the Greater London Council on1 January 1970.british waterways board7. The provision covers the deficiency betweenthe Board&apos;s revenues and the minimum expendi-ture needed to maintain the waterways. how the proposed transfer of responsibility for theBoard&apos;s waterways to the Regional water authorities may affect the provision necessary inthis respect cannot at present be forecast.national bus company8. The Transport (Grants) Act 1972 providedfor a special grant of  7 million in 1972 to enablethe Company to respond to the CBI initiativeon prices without being in breach of its statutoryfinancial duty. If price restraint continued, theNBC would feel continuing effects in 1973 and beyond, but though there would then be a needfor further assistance it is too soon to say how much or in what form.scottish transport group9. The provision relates to subsidies payable tothe Group, mainly in respect of losses on WesternHighlands and Islands snipping services, operated by its subsidiary, David MacBrayne Limited.Other surface transportports10. The estimates cover investment by theindependent harbour trusts, and local authorityowned harbours, and grants and loans to ports in the private sector. Expenditure in the periodshows some reduction compared with Cmnd.4829 revalued, mainly because of the setting upof the Mersey Docks and Harbour Company,replacing the Board. The Company is classifiedin the private sector, and therefore the estimatesnow include provision for loans to the Company,to finance modernisation, amounting to 29 million. But this expenditure is more than offset by the removal from the estimates of thecapital investment programme of the Board,amounting to  45 million over the period.bus fuel grants11. The estimates reflect the continuing policyof refunding to operators of bus stage servicesincreases of fuel duty since 1964.rural bus and ferry services12. This provision comprises central Govern-ment and local authority assistance towards theprovision, maintenance or improvement of busand ferry services for the benefit of people in rural areas.
infrastructure expenditure13. This provision covers gross expenditure bylocal authorities and nationalised industries on measures designed to assist public transportprojects in commuter areas, including all expendi-ture on fixed assets by BRB in London and theSouth East. The provision includes the estimatedcost of the Liverpool Terminal Loop, theelectrification of certain north London suburbanrail services and the first stage of the Fleet Line.The estimates for the period from 1973-74 are substantially greater than Cmnd. 4829 revaluedbecause the cost of two major schemes, thesecond stage of the Fleet Line and the TynesideRapid Transit project, have been added, thoughdetailed consideration of these projects is as yetat an early stage. In addition expenditure onthe Manchester Tunnel project is now likely tobe incurred at an earlier date.other passenger transportLondon14. Detailed consideration of the investment programme of London Transport is a matter forthe GLC. Forecast expenditure shows anincrease from Cmnd. 4829 revalued on bothrailways and buses, the latter in particularreflecting the policy of speeding up theintroduction of one-man operation. (The rate of grants for new buses has recently been increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent.)Other15. The provision comprises investment esti-mates for the Passenger Transport Executives andthe municipal transport undertakings. Theincrease over Cmnd. 4829 revalued reflectsincreased purchases of one-man operated busesand expenditure on garage projects.miscellaneous transport services16. The main items are road safety, rail research and receipts from fees for driving and vehicletests. A small provision has been made forDepartment of the Environment expenditure inconnection with the Channel Tunnel. The projectitself would, however, be financed mainly by private sector loans (Government guaranteed),and therefore public expenditure would not beaffected.17. The provision for road safety is much thesame as in Cmnd. 4829 revalued and reflects the likely level of expenditure when road safetybecomes a statutory duty of the proposed newfirst-tier authorities. A PAR on road safety isat present in progress.18.

The forecasts reflect the new arrangements for housing finance incorporated in the Bills now before Parliament. This legislation involves onlyone significant change in policy compared withthe position in Cmnd. 4829, the decision to treatsingle parents with dependent children on the same basis as married couples for the purpose of rent rebates and allowances. The question of extend-ing allowances to the tenants of furnisheddwellings is still under discussion with the localauthority associations: if eventually adopted, this extension might cost some  5- 10 million a year from 1973-74 onwards.2.

The policy change is basically the treatmentof single parent families already referred to:otherwise the figures are much the same asCmnd. 4829 revalued. The figures are subject toa wide margin of uncertainty because of various factors such as the amount to be paid in rent rebates and allowances, the levels of fair rents and so on.
Option mortgage scheme. The estimates have been increased because ofthe growing popularity of option mortgages(particularly in England and Wales) which has arisen partly through relaxation in the optionmortgage scheme itself and partly through achange in the relative attractiveness of tax relief on interest payments. As a result, 10 per cent of new advances (instead of about 5 per cent as hitherto) are expected to be on option mortgages.The forecasts are subject to a wide variation inthe later years of the Survey period.Improvement grants5. The build-up in the level of improvement grants is not now expected to be so rapid asforecast last year. The effect of this change is however partly offset by the decision to extend the scope of the Housing Act 1971 for a further year and in England and Wales to all assisted areas.Investment6. The provision for new house building is basedon the following estimated approvals (theestimates used in Cmnd. 4829 are in brackets):Year England Scotland Wales1970 94,460 20,824 5,192(actual)1971 90,070(101,500) 23,122(23,000) 3,700(5,650)(actual)1972 90,000(104,000) 32,000(25,000) 5,250(6,000)1973 90,000(108,000) 26,000(27,000) 5,500(6,000)1974 90,000(106,500) 24,000(27,500) 5,650(6,000)1975 90,000(105,500) 24,000(27,500) 5,650(6,000)1976 90,000 23,000 5,650These figures exclude approvals for subsidisedhousing associations.7. The total investment figures originally&apos; sub-mitted show a marked decline, both absolutelyand compared with the Cmnd. 4829 estimates,largely because of a reduction in the number ofnew nouses expected to be approved, both for local authorities and new towns. To arrive at thefigures in the Report, however, the Treasury have reduced the DOE forecasts and the DOE do not accept the validity of this reduction.8. The level of local authority approvals hasbeen falling since 1966 when it was 154,000. In1971 there were 84,800 some 1,200 less than in1970. The fall however was much less than inthe previous years and in the latter part of T971there was a slight upturn the figure for last quarter of 1971 was 36,600 compared with32,900 in the same quarter in 1970. The DOEview is that although it is perhaps unlikely thatthis improvement will be maintained, and it isstill difficult to assess with any degree of cer-tainty the effects of the Housing Finance Bill, asubstantial increase in slum clearance is to beexpected because of the incentive of the new slum clearance subsidy and the determination ofMinisters to press local authorities to get rid ofthe remaining slums. This is bound to give riseto additional new building. Although the move to fair rents may well increase the movementof council tenants into owner occupation, the fair rent excludes scarcity whereas house prices donot and prices have been moving rapidly upwardsespecially in the areas like London where housingpressures are heaviest and where the need for new local authority building is greatest. More-over many council tenants and potential counciltenants will be eligible for rent rebates, and thereis a general shortage of rented accommodation for particular groups, e.g. the elderly, childlesscouples and young and middle-aged single people,who have not hitherto been adequately cateredfor and whose needs can only be substantiallymet by council house building. In the DOE&apos;view these factors point clearly to the likelihood of a continuing need for a reasonable level of council house building (possibly higher indeedthan the relatively low level currently being achieved). Because the advent of higher rentspoints the other way, DOE do not consider thatwe should at this stage anticipate any marked increase in local authority building over the levelof approvals in 1971. On the other hand, theyconsider that it would be unwise to assumesavings beyond those represented by that general level.9. Under the stimulus of rising levels ofindustrial activity the DOE expect New Townapprovals to recover from the low point reached in 1970-71, with house building programmes for several of the most recent New Towns (suchas Milton Keynes, Peterborough and Northamp-ton) &quot; taking off&quot; during the Survey period. TheHousing Finance Bill should have no disincentiveeffect, because many New Town rents are already at or near the fair rent level; neither is there anyquestion of ratepayers paying part of the localsubsidy bill. A PAR examination of New Townswas carried out in 1971; it concluded that therewere no reasons for reducing the scale or scopeof New Town activities, although there was a need to review the financing and capitalstructures of New/Town corporations.10. The Treasury on the other hand believe thatthe effect of the slum clearance subsidy, will beslower than the DOE have assumed, and thatthe move to fair rents will depress the level of demand for additional local authority housebuilding, particulary in London where the mainbuilding authorities are. The annual increase ingross rents over the Survey period is expectedto average 11 per cent, and this figure is likely
to be greater than the increase in house prices.The Treasury thus believe that there will be some shift of local authority tenants to owner occupation, and think that an additional outflow of more than 10,000 a year out of a total of4-1 million is not unreasonable. The effect ofthis cut would be to reduce the level ofapprovals to 90,000 in each of the five years ofthe Survey period: the financial effect is to reducethe forecasts by  4 million in 1973-74,  17million in 1974-75,  29 million in 1975-76 and 28 million in 1976-77 compared to the DOE&apos;original forecast. This is a difference of viewabout forecasts, and does not of itself mean thatthe Treasury would seek to keep investment tothe Treasury figures if the DOE&apos;s forecasts provedcorrect.11. The Scottish pattern of house approvalsdiffers from England and Wales in that the new legislation in Scotland is expected to cause anunusually high level of approvals in 1972. Theeffects on approvals of the reform of housing finance are expected to take longer to work through in Scotland than in England and Walesfor several reasons including the present lower level of rents.12. Other changes in the investment figuresprovide for a decline in local authorities&apos; invest-ment in land for their own housing based on current experience^ and an increase in improve-ments to local authority houses as a result of* The recently announced scheme for accelerating landpurchases is reflected in the Miscellaneous local servicesprogramme, below.an unexpectedly vigorous response to Govern-ment encouragement to undertake comprehensiveimprovement schemes. The extension of theHousing Act 1971 will also increase localauthority improvement expenditure in the same way as it increases improvement grant and inaddition there has been an increase in the limit of expenditure qualifying for environmentalimprovement grant. There has also been anincrease in the estimate of local authority andNew Town sales of houses, which should rise toabout 20,000 a year.Lending13. Forecasts for lending are liable to bigfluctuations as lending to private persons (thelargest item) tends to vary according to the availability of funds from other sources. Forthis reason there is considerable uncertainty inthe forecasts for the latter part of the five-year period. However, it is expected that there willbe some reduction in gross lending, even allow-ing for the fact that with the passage of the new housing finance legislation the Housing Corpora-tion as well as local authorities will henceforthbe able to lend money to housing associations,and that local authority loans to the associationsfor improvement work are likely to increasebecause of the recent up-rating of the level of exchequer grant. It is also expected that therewill be an increase in repayments. The overallresult will be to produce a decrease in net lend-ing which is now forecast to run at a low levelin relation to the gross value of lending.16.

This programme largely comprises the wide variety of services concerned with public health,avoidance of pollution, improvement of the environment and the development of localfacilities and amenities, most of which are theresponsibility of local authorities. In addition,the research expenditure of the Department ofthe Environment has been brought together andis included within this bloc for the first time.Capital expenditure england and wales. Apart from New Towns see paragraph 4below the estimates for water and for sewerage and sewage disposal are based upon those in cmnd. 4829, divergencies representing no morethan the recosting of existing policies. they provide for steadily increasing expenditure tomeet rapidly increasing and inescapable demands on these services, due to population changes, new industrial development and essential public needs.Over the Survey period expenditure on water isexpected to rise by 21-9 per cent, and onsewerage by 21-2 per cent.3. On 2 December 1971 the government announced its intention of transferring in 1974responsibility for these services to new RegionalWater Authorities. These authorities will beresponsible for sewage disposal as part of their control of the hydrological cycle, and may beexpected to take more energetic action to improveeffluent standards to enable a greater re-use ofwater. The River Pollution Survey, the second part of which will be published this year, will vprovide an indication of the problem areas, but itis already clear that a considerable amount ofwork will in due course be necessary. the regional Water Authorities will also need todevelop further sources of water on a large scale.To meet the demands, the Departments believethat the rate of increase in expenditure may need to be accelerated in the future, although theestablishment of a small number of strongauthorities is designed to ensure the comprehensive long-term planning of waterresources with due regard to efficiency and economy.4. Provision has also been made for the effectof the recosting of sewerage programmes in new towns which results in increased expenditure in1972-73, 1973-74 and 1974-75, with reductions in later years. The major item is a new mainsewerage works for Milton Keynes, which cannotbe delayed without risk to the housing programme there.5. Most local authority expenditure on other public health and on improvement of the environment now comes within the locally determined sector, under the new arrangementsfor the control of capital expenditure introduced in April 1971. It is not yet possible to say to what extent the arrangements will lead to aredistribution of expenditure, either withinMiscellaneous local services, or between thevarious programmes which now include locally determined capital expenditure. Specific account is taken in the forecasts of the additional expenditure and receipts which will arise fromthe programme of purchase and subsequentresale of land for private housing development which has been announced by the Secretary ofState for the Environment. Provision for this programme has been included as follows:		  million	at 1972	Survey	prices	1972	1973	1974	1975	1976	-73	-74	-75	-76	-77Expenditure .	35	45	 	 	-Proceeds from sales	 	y.- 1	&apos;   10	40	40
Provision has also been included in 1972-73 and1973-74 for the Special EnvironmentalAssistance Scheme, and for expenditure by theCity of London on the Guildhall and BarbicanArts Centre. Apart from this no changes otherthan statistical adjustments arising from pastover-estimates of sale proceeds have been madeto the estimates in Cmnd. 4829, revalued.6. The forecasts of locally determinedexpenditure, as shown in the Special Analysison page 75 below reflect existing policies. TheDepartments consider, however, that the presentprovision shows insufficient growth over the survey period, and is inconsistent with the declared intention of the Secretary of State forthe Environment to see increased expenditure onthe environment. The local authority associationshave already indicated that they consider thepresent &quot; pool&quot; as inadequate to meet thedemands placed upon them for services.Accordingly, the Departments consider that theprovision for Improvement of the Environmentshould be increased as follows:  million at 1972 Survey prices1972-73    1973-74	1974-75	1975-76	1976-77-        + 10-0	+20-0	+30 0	4-40-0This would be added to the total pool, and while there could be no assurance that it would all be spent on environmental improvement, the secretaries of State would make clear to thelocal authorities their wish that it should beused for this purpose.7. The provision for New Towns industrial and commercial development takes account of therephasing of programmes by some of the corporations. Some expenditure on industrialdevelopment and town centre development is tobe brought forward to earlier years than previously planned, mainly in towns which arein Development Areas or which are sufferingfrom high unemployment (e.g. Peterlee,Skelmersdale and Peterborough) but alsoincluding Milton Keynes, where the housing programme is now expected to move aheadrapidly.8. In recognition of the coming into operation in April 1972 of the new Sports Councils, theSport figures, as compared with Cmnd. 4829,have been slightly increased. The figuresrepresent a continuation of existing policy. TheSports Councils have not yet formulated and submitted for consideration their own policies.9. With the combination of the various researchactivities of the Department of the Environmentunder  a   central   organisation   it  has   beenCONFIDENTIALconsidered appropriate to introduce a singleheading for all DOE research expenditure. Theprovision covers expenditure on environmental,building and transport research and rises from 11-2 million in 1972-73 to  21-1 million in1976-77, reflecting a rapidly growing researchrequirement.10. The forecasts for land drainage in Englandand Wales include expenditure on the ThamesFlood Barrier and associated works, bothinterim works required upstream and permanentworks downstream of the proposed barrier. the forecasts are in line with Ministerial decisions and are higher than those included in last year&apos;sSurvey partly because of cost increases andpartly because the extent of the works required is becoming clearer. Nevertheless, detaileddesign work has not yet reached the stage whereprecise cost estimates of either the Barrier orthe associated downstream works can be made;and it seems likely that present forecasts will eventually need to be increased.scotland11. The revised arrangements for control do notapply in Scotland where capital expenditure bylocal authorities on all these services continues tobe regulated through individual loan sanction.The main change to the Scottish figures comparedwith Cmnd. 4829 arises from the inclusion off first-time provision of  7-3 million over the survey period for the proposed New Town atStonehouse.12. Apart from this, the forecasts overall are in line with Cmnd. 4829, although within the totalthere are considerable variations. The forecast for sewerage and sewage disposal is increased to accommodate several major new schemes and the acceleration of already planned schemes proposedby the local authorities as a result of the increas-ing pressure for action on environmentalpollution. That increase is, however, largelyoffset by reductions elsewhere in expenditure ontown and country planning, administrative build-ings and New Towns, the latter arising primarilyfrom the expectation that East Kilbride will havereached its planned population by mid-1975.13. Present forecasts reflect existing policy. TheScottish Office considers however that additional provision should bef included for Improvement ofthe Environment in line with the proposals by theDepartment of the Environment and the welsh office in paragraph 6. The extra sums requestedare as follows:  million at 1972 Survey prices1972-73    1973-74    1974-75	1975-76	1976-77^    -   i     &apos;   2	3	443
Current expenditure14. The forecasts for all three countries reflectfor 1973-74 the most recent Rate Support GrantOrders. For subsequent years, they projectforward the trends of expenditure on those ser-vices that emerge from these settlements andfrom the 1970-71 outturn. The forecast for1973-74 however in England and Wales takes account of the effect on current expenditure of thehigher level of capital expenditure now forecastover that used in the last RSG determination.Additional provision has also been included from1973-74 onwards for the extra costs which theDepartments believe that authorities will need tobear as a direct result of local government reorganisation. These include elections, the initial expenses of the new authorities, who inEngland and Wales will overlap with the existing authorities in 1973-74, the costs of winding upthe existing authorities, and staff compensation.The additional sums included are as follows:  million at 1972 Survey prices1973 1974 1975 1976-74     -75     -76     -77England and Wales . . 22-4 13-0 5-0 2-scotland ....     -     1-6     10      0-315. Local authority expenditure in the three countries, excluding provision for reorganisation,shows an average annual rate of growth over the survey period as a whole of about 4 per cent.However in the view of the Departments the pres-sures on local authorities for additional expendi-ture on environmental improvement are such thatit will be extremely difficult to contain the forecasts produced at the Rate Support grant negotiations within the existing provision. Theincreased capital expenditure proposed in para-graphs 6 and 13 would, if agreed, itself lead toconsequential additional expenditure. TheDepartments also expect authorities to incurcurrent expenditure on other works. Accordinglythey consider that the annual rate of growthexcluding reorganisation costs should be increasedto about 5 per cent by the addition of thefollowing amounts:  million at 1972 Survey prices1973 1974 1975 1976-74     -75     -76     -77England and Wales . .1-6 8-4 16-0 23-3Scotland ....     0-1     0-8     1-5     2117.

HOME DEPARTMENTS&apos; SERVICESPoliceengland and wales. Police expenditure is expected to rise by 18-2 per cent over the period 1972-73 to 1976-77.The expenditure forecasts assume that policestrengths will rise from 97,850 (600 less than was assumed in Cmnd. 4829) to 116,600. Civilianstrengths are expected to rise from 39,550 (1,800below the Cmnd. 4829 figure mainly because of a shortfall  in estimated recruitment of trafficwardens) to 65,100; this includes provision foran additional 17,000 traffic wardens. a programme Analysis and Review is in progress to examine questions concerning the determina-tion of police manpower resources and closely related issues, but it is not far enough advanced to be taken into account in this Survey.2. The forecasts provide for a modest increasein expenditure on research into police methods,equipment and communication; for new building work at forensic science laboratories, wirelessdepots and the Police College; and equipment for the wireless rental scheme. There is areduction in computer capital expenditure reflect-ing the completion of the main building and purchase of the main Police National Computerequipment, although building delays have meant that part of the main computer equipmentexpenditure has had to be deferred from1971-72 to 1972-73. Increased expenditure oncomputer communications will arise from 1973-74and for the Phase II building from 1974-75onwards. Current expenditure on the PoliceNational Computer project will increase by  1-4 million when operational running costs begin.3. The programme includes a total of  1 million over the years 1973-74 to 1975-76 for the re-engineering of the police and fire wireless schemesas a result of the reorganisation of local govern-ment boundaries. Staff increases at all specialestablishments and extra equipment at newforensic science laboratories and police trainingcentres also contribute to increased current expenditure.4. It is difficult to allocate the increased expen-diture between improvements and maintenanceof existing standards but a large proportion of theincreased manpower is intended to bring policestrengths up to existing and revised establish-ments, and to provide for more traffic wardens to (enable better provision to be made for urbantraffic schemes.scotland5. Expenditure is expected to increase by 11-3 per cent over the period. The expenditure fore-casts assume that police strengths will rise from10,900 to 11,900 and civilian strengths from,050 to 4,170-this latter figure provides for1,000 traffic wardens. The increase in policestrengths starts from a higher base than previouslyforecast as a result of increased recruitmentbut in 1972-73 and 1973-74 continues at the same rate as in Cmnd. 4829 with a reduced ratethereafter.Prisonsengland and wales6. A Programme Analysis and Review of thegeneral objectives for the treatment of offenders,covering the programmes for Prisons and forProbation and After-care, was completed in 1971.Ministers endorsed its conclusions, which con-firmed the policy of prison provision reflected in the current prison building programme, andnoted that the programme did little more thanmatch the increase in the projected prison popula-tion over the Survey period.7. Expenditure is expected to increase by 43-2 per cent over the Survey period. This is tomaintain the momentum of the capital pro-gramme and to meet the forecast increase in the prison population. About two-fifths of theincrease in expenditure is in respect of current expenditure (mainly pay and allowances attribut-able to an assumed annual growth of non-industrial staff of 1,050 in 1972-73 and 1,100 ayear thereafter), while the remainder is attribut-able to capital expenditure on new buildings,alterations, plant, machinery and vehicles.Allowance has been made for some relief of the prison problem by the development of probationhostels and more intensive forms of non-custodial treatment and the combined expenditure forecasts for the period 1972-73 to 1975-76for both the prisons and probation and after-care services have been kept within the Cmnd.4829 figures as now revalued. The mainassumptions are that the total inmate population in prisons, borstals, detention centres and remandcentres will rise from 43,000 (compared with44,700 in Cmnd. 4829) to 54,750 and thatthere will be an increase of 5,450 in non-industrial staff of all grades over the period.There has been a recent drop in inmate popula-tion but it is expected/that the rising trend willbe resumed.8. The staff growth will not do more than match the expected increase in the population, so thatthe ratio of staff in all grades to the number ofinmates will remain at the current level of1:2-7. The planned opening of new establish-ments, where staff ratios tend to be higher thanin existing overcrowded establishments, means that there is unlikely to be a significant reductionin overtime working. Provision is also made for
an increase in the number of probation officersseconded for welfare duties in prison establish-ments which, together with social workers, will rise from 382 in 1972-73 to 515 in 1967-77,and for the introduction of some ancillary workers to take over part of the routine welfarework which does not require professionalexpertise and so relieve the welfare officers toundertake more positive casework.Capital expenditure. The capital programme has been phased soas to continue the building effort put in hand to maintain starts of an average of 3,000 newplaces a year over the Survey period. It willcontinue to aim to place most emphasis on theprovision of more Category C (low security)adult and more young offender accommodation.The programme allows for purpose-built estab-lishments, for the adaptation of certain &quot; camp &quot;sites, and for the expansion of some existingestablishments.10. The capital programme assumes the provi-sion of about 12,000 places (compared with9,000 in Cmnd. 4829) over the Survey period.The following table shows the schemes which itis hoped will be completed in 1972-73 to 1976-77(excluding housing).  millionDispersal prisons   .	465 places at			 7,620 per place	3	54Category B prisons	507 places at			 7,620 per place	3	86Category C prisons	968 places at		(medium and long term)	 6,540 per place	6	33Category C prisons	3,264 places at		(short term)	 5,400 per place	17	63Young offender training I	695 places at			 7,370 per place	5	12Young offender training II	1,190 places at			 6,480 per place	7	71Camps ....	3,025 places at			 4,500 per place	13	61Remand and allocation	1,260 places at		centres	 7,370 per place	9	29Extensions to existing	2,290 places at		establishments	 2,500 per place	5	72		72	8111. The population forecasts show that therewould be a need for an additional 11,750 placesover the Survey period to prevent overcrowdingbecoming worse. Despite the current drop in prison population figures there are still about13,000 inmates sleeping two or three in a cell.The present capital programme is unlikely there-fore to make any great improvement in thesituation, although the proportion of the popula-tion sleeping two or three in a cell should fall.12. The forecast expenditure includes provisionof some  32 million to provide something over4,500 quarters for prison officers, at an average cost of  7,000 per quarter, including those builtwith new establishments, to cover the needs ofnew recruitment, to provide a limited number ofreplacements and to reduce the current backlogstemming from inadequacy of past provision. Ahigh level of maintenance will continue to benecessary at older establishments but no furthermajor schemes of redevelopment can be put inhand at closed prisons in the next few years.Industries13. Workshop space in existing establishmentsis expected to continue to increase at the rateof some 100,000 sq. ft. a year over the survey period in addition to workshop space being provided in new establishments. Prison industries will incur more expenditure on raw materials,plant and machinery and training, leading to increased production and sales and a hoped for continuing improvement in profitability.Current expenditure14. Other current expenditure allows for thedevelopment of educational facilities, improve-ment in prisoners&apos; earnings, aid on discharge,improvement of communications equipment and facilities to meet the needs of the expected risein the prison population over the Survey period.scotland15. The policies underlying the programme wereendorsed by Ministers following the programme analysis and Review mentioned in paragraph above. The expenditure is expected to increase by 40-5 per cent over the period mainly becauseof an increased capital programme and itsrevenue consequences. The capital programme isnecessary to cope with the present overcrowdingin which 2,117 inmates are sleeping two or three to a cell, and also the expected rise in totalinmate population from 5,800 to 7,500 in1976-77. The programme will provide 1,700additional places in the forecast period which means that there is unlikely to be any improve-ment in the overcrowding position. Therevenue consequences of the capital programmeconsist mainly of/&quot; additional staff and provision has been made for an increase of 586 non-industrial staff during the period.Probation and after-careengland and wales16. As a result of the Programme Analysis and review of the treatment of offenders, Ministersendorsed the policy of expanding the probationservice, including hostel and after-care facilities,
to encourage the courts to use probation forsuitable offenders who might otherwise be sentto custody.17. Expenditure is expected to rise by 55-1 percent during the period. The main assumptionsare that the number of probation officers will rise from 3,500 (the same figure as in Cmnd. 4829)to 4,720 and ancillary staff from 145 (140 in cmnd. 4829) to 425. The planned expansionof the probation service over the Survey period will continue and the forecasts provide for additional expenditure on the new adult hostels(for which provision was included in Cmnd. 4829)which, under the Criminal Justice Bill, areexpected to operate under the control of probation and after-care committees but withinthe present flat-rate system whereby the costs areshared equally between central and local govern-ment. Additional provision (not previouslyincluded in the estimates) of  0-2 million in1972-73 rising to  3-2 million in 1976-77 ismade for the experimental introduction and subsequent wider implementation of new develop-ments relating to community service, day trainingcentres, bail hostels, etc. to be provided as analternative to custodial treatment of offendersand for after-care hostels. Additional funds havebeen made available amounting to  0-8 million over the period for the encouragement of volun-tary social service with especial reference to volun-tary after-care hostels. It is assumed that therewill be some 1,200 hostel places available at thebeginning of 1972-73 and that 200 additionalplaces in voluntary hostels will be provided ineach year of the Survey period (an assumptionunchanged since Cmnd. 4829).18. Training of probation students (includingwelfare officers in prisons) to meet the needs ofthe probation service will continue to expand,and the forecasts envisage an output of 575trained probation officers in 1973 and 600 in1974 and the following years.19. The forecasts do not take account of pos-sible further expansion of the probation service in the light of the recent report of the Houseof Commons Expenditure Sub-Committee.Fire serviceENGLAND AND WALES20. Expenditure is forecast to rise by 7-9 percent during the period. The main assumptionsare that the numbers of whole-time firemen will increase from 25,235 (25,780 in Cmnd. 4829)to 26,970, an increase of 1,735, while civilianstaffs will increase from 3,653 (3,702 in Cmnd.4829) to 4,365, an increase of 712. Of these,1,120 firemen and 145 civilians respectively are needed to implement the recommendations of theDepartmental Committee on the Fire Service(Holroyd Report), mainly to provide improvedtraining. The complements of retained (part-time) and junior firemen are expected to remainsteady during the Survey period at 14,000 and140 respectively.21. The balance of the additional recruitmentfigures is for the basic needs of the service indealing with the increasing incidence of fires and fire risks. Although recruitment has not been as high as forecast in recent Surveys, the fore-casts have been based on the assumption that the improved pay settlement resulting from theCunningham Report will encourage net recruit-ment and that the estimated strengths of whole-time firemen incorporated in the Rate support grant settlement will be reached and the forecastrate of recruitment will be maintained.22. Provision of  0-1 million in 1973-74 rising to  1-0 million in 1976-77 has been included for building and running costs of the centralisedrecruit training establishment recommended inthe Holroyd Report. In the latter part of 1971it was agreed that implementation of the Holroydrecommendations would be slower than had been previously forecast, and the estimated additional expenditure has therefore been deferred by oneyear compared with Cmnd. 4829.scotland23. Expenditure is expected to increase by 8-per cent over the period. The forecasts assumean average annual increase of about 75 whole-time firemen.Other services england and wales24. Expenditure, which is mainly by way of grants to statutory or voluntary bodies, is shownin Table 17 to fall in 1973-74, and to rise slowlyover the rest of the Survey period. This pictureis however distorted by the inclusion in the1972-73 estimates of capital expenditure of anon-recurring nature on the Urban Programmeamounting to  6-2 million ( 5-4 million is for regional infrastructure and  0-8 million has beentransferred from DHSS, for general day careprojects). If this sum is excluded the increase over the period becomes 41 per cent.25. The main factors in the increase are:Urban Programme: Excluding the once-for-all capital items mentioned above, expenditure is estimated to rise from  9-5 million in1972-73 to  12-5 million in 1975-76 and 13-6 million in 1976-77. The programme is however being reviewed and its continuancebeyond 1975-76 has not yet been approved.To this extent the figures are provisional.Criminal  Injuries   Compensation   Board:After allowing for contributions from the
Scottish Home and Health Department, thenet increase over the period 1972-73 to1976-77 is expected to be  1-8 million. Thisis based upon higher revised estimates of annual increase in the total intake of cases(from 9,900 in 1972-73 to 15,255 in 1976-77)coupled with a higher rate of award and ahigher proportion of awards.26. The estimates also take account of increased expenditure on the Women&apos;s Royal voluntary service ( 0-2 million), the Community relations commission ( 0-3 million) and the Race Rela-tions Board ( 0-1 million); the forecasts for thefirst time include a notional sum of  0-1 million a year for the voluntary repatriation scheme(introduced under the Immigration Act 1971).scotland27. This includes provision for the Urban Pro-gramme which is estimated to rise from  1-5 million in 1972-73 (of which  0-4 million is for capital projects under the infrastructure pro-gramme in the assisted areas) to  1-6 million in1976-77 and for contributions to the HomeOffice in respect of the Scottish share of CriminalInjuries Compensation Board expenditure whichis expected to rise from  0-8 million in 1972-73to  1-2 million in 1976-77.Departmental administrationengland and wales28. Expenditure is expected to rise by 21-6 percent over the period. This is almost wholly dueto the cost of salaries, travelling and subsistenceof increased staff growth of about 5 per cent a year is forecast-(an assumption unchanged fromCmnd. 4829). A distorting element in thepresent Survey comes from capital expenditureof  0-6 million in 1974-75 for the provision ofan automatic telephone exchange required as aresult of the decision to transfer the immigration and Nationality Department to Lunar House,Croydon. The exchange will also cater for thestaff of other departments.Comparison with Cmnd. 482929.

In 1973-74the increase of  0-7 million is due mainly to thecarry forward of projects from the previous yearand to expected additional recruitment.Law courts31. The programme covers expenditure on bothhigher and lower courts in Great Britain as wellas the costs incurred by departments concernedwith the administration of justice.32. The main factor determining the level ofexpenditure is the work load of the courts, butfollowing the passing of the Courts Act 1971capital expenditure is expected to increase sub-stantially from 1972-73 onwards because of theneed to provide additional higher courts whereexisting facilities are inadequate.england and walesMagistrates&apos; and other lower courts33. Magistrates&apos; courts account for more than half the total expenditure on law courts inEngland and Wales, and most of this relates tothe cost of running these courts.34. The estimates which are based upon recenttrends in the workload in those courts, do not differ significantly from those in Cmnd. 4829.They show expenditure increasing by 29 percent over the Survey period due to a continuingincrease in the volume of work. The figures alsoreflect the need to replace some existing courtbuildings taken over for use as higher courts.Higher courts35. The estimates cover expenditure on thehigher courts including the new Crown court and the County Courts.36. On 1 January 1972, as a result of the courts act 1971, Assizes and Quarter Sessions (whichCONFIDENTIAL49
had been the responsibility of local authorities)were replaced by the Crown Court (for which thecentral Government is responsible).37. This radical reorganisation has led to pro-posals for increased capital expenditure on acentralised court building programme in order to remedy the deficiencies in the existing provisionof higher courts. The building programme whichis estimated to cost more than  70 million spreadover 20 years or so is expected to reach a peak of about  10-5 million in 1976-77. There wouldhave been an increase in public expenditure upto 1975-76 of  5 million on new buildingschemes, but for the effects of a correction tothe method of recording payments for theacquisition of court buildings from local authori-ties. The overall result is a decrease of  1 million in this period compared with Cmnd.4829 revalued.38. The recent decision to offset certain fees and charges against public expenditure high-lights a long-standing difference of opinion between the Treasury and the Lord ChancellorsOffice on how far the cost of civil business inthe courts should be covered by fee income. TheTreasury&apos;s view is that fees should cover boththe direct costs of running the courts and thecost of allied services. The Lord ChancellorsOffice consider that some continuing deficit on direct costs is probably inescapable; this is esti-mated at  2 million a year from 1972-73onwards.scotland39. It is intended that from 1 April 1973, theprovision and maintenance of Sheriff CourtHouses will become the responsibility of thecentral Government; they are currently a localauthority responsibility. Although this parallelsthe position on higher courts in England andWales the effect on public expenditure is much less complex and account of it has been taken in previous Surveys. In consequence there is no significant change in the forecasts on Scottishcourts compared with Cmnd. 4829.Legal aid40. The estimates cover expenditure on theprovision of legal aid, advice and assistance for those of limited means, and are based on estimates of demand for the service. There isno scope for reducing the level of expenditurewithout a reduction in the scope of the legal aid Schemes, which could not be achieved with-out legislation.41. The figures for legal aid in Great Britainassume that the number of both civil and criminal cases in which legal aid is granted will continueto rise. Apart from this, the other main reasonsfor the increase in forecast expenditure indicated by the present Survey, are the introduction in1973-74 (subject to the passage of a Bill now before Parliament) of a new Scheme for legal advice and assistance which is expected to cost 1-7 million in the first year of operation rising to  2-6 million by 1976-77; and the cost of bailapplications in criminal cases, previously handledat nominal cost by the Official Solicitor, whichin future will be heard by the Crown Court atan estimated additional cost of  0-3 million in1972-73 rising to  0-4 million by 1976-77.42. The figures show a decrease, when corn-pared with Cmnd. 4829 revalued, of  3 - 6 million over the period 1972-73 to 1975-76, but this isdue largely to the correction of an estimatingerror and does not indicate a fall-off in demand.18.

The Arts programme now includesexpenditure on local as well as national museums and galleries. Expenditure on nationallibraries, the Royal Geographical Society and theBritish Institute of Recorded Sound has ceased to be part of the Arts programme and is includedin the Education and libraries programme.2. The British Museum Library is to becomepart of the British Library. The provisionallyestimated share of the British Museumexpenditure which is in respect of the british museum Library has accordingly been transferredto the Education and libraries programme.3. Adjusted for these changes of coverage the totals are broadly in line with Cmnd. 4829revalued.Museums and galleries4. Agreement has not been reached on thefigures for the national building programme. TheDepartment of Education and Science (DES)submitted revised estimates of the cost of makingthe earliest practicable progress, which in their view represents existing policy, on the schemeslisted in the White Paper on Future Policy forMuseums and Galleries (Cmnd. 4676). Thisannounced that starts would be authorised &apos; whenplanning and design are completed &quot;. They pointout that Ministers are publicly committed to these schemes. The Treasury take the view that existing policy must be defined as the expenditure figures announced in that White Paper, and thatit deliberately avoided commitment to startingCONFIDENTIALdates on individual schemes. They have thereforesubstituted the Cmnd. 4829 figures, revalued, forthe DES figures, and note that it will be for ministers to decide whether to authorise any additional expenditure (up to  0-8 million ayear).5. Provision for the national museums and galleries allows for the maintenance of, and additions to, the collections. The introduction ofgeneral admission charges is estimated to raise ina full year  850,000 net from the Englishinstitutions. A further  100,000 will be earnedfrom Scottish and Welsh institutions; and anadditional  100,000 by the British Museum(Natural History) and the Geological Museum,provision for which is made in other programmes.National Theatre6. Sums of  700,000 (Government) and 800,000 (Greater London Council) have been included for the National Theatre for 1973-74,bringing the total anticipated expenditure to 7-5 million plus  0-5 million for the GLCsexpenditure on car parking. The final cost islikely to be higher than this but no provision forthe increase is included in the estimates.Arts Council, etc.7. Provision for the Arts Council, the BritishFilm Institute and the National Film School ismade on the basis of a 10 per cent increase in real terms on the previous year, as in Cmnd. 4829.Provision of  0-2 million a year is made for theCrafts as from 1972-73, with a growth rate of10 per cent in the last year.51

The programme has been retitled &quot; education and Libraries &quot; because it now covers all national and local library services, and excludes localmuseums.2. The forecast is that between 1972-73 and1976-77 expenditure in Great Britain will rise by 425 - 0 million or 3 - 0 per cent a year. The totalsfor 1972-73 and 1973-74, however, include thespecial provision of  43-7 million for the infra-structure works programme; if that is excludedexpenditure rises over the period by 3-4 per cent a year.3. Manpower engaged in the education service(excluding universities) is expected to increase byabout 3-3 per cent a year over the period from907,000 in April 1972 to 1,066,000 in April 1977.4. The estimates have been based on the con-continuation of existing policies (but see paragraph15 below). No attempt has been made to anticipate Ministerial decisions on future provi-sion for higher education which will need to betaken later this year in the light of the recom-mendations of the James Committee on teacher training, the proposals by the UGC for the quinquennial settlement 1972-77, and the 1971Higher Education PAR (which sets out optionsrelevant to expenditure mainly in the second halfof the decade).5. Education Departments are at present engagedin a PAR study covering the direction and priorities of future strategy on nursery, primary and secondary schools and higher education(taking account of the conclusions of the 1971PAR). It has not been possible to anticipate theresults of this review in the present forecastsbut it should be completed in time to serve asa background for Ministerial decisions on schools and higher education expenditure in the context of this Survey. /6. The aim of the expenditure is, as always, tomake the necessary provision, capital and current,for the numbers of pupils and students expectedK to attend schools and colleges. The main reasonsfor the rising expenditure are the larger numberof secondary pupils staying at school as a resultof raising the school leaving age, the growth inthe number of school leavers qualifying for higher education and the improvement in the teacher/pupil ratios.

The estimate of local authority current expenditure for 1972-73 is determined by the rate support grant settlement for that year; projectionsof this expenditure for subsequent years proceedfrom that base.9. On 1 April 1972 building cost limits forschools were raised by 8 per cent on accountof pay and price increases. The cost limitswere also raised by a further 7 per cent to help to restore standard areas for pupils to 1966 levels,making a 15 per cent increase in all.10. The forecasts of capital expenditure providetor building starts as follows:  million at 1972 Survey prices1972 1973 1974 1975 1976-73     -74     -75     -76     -77Schools       .      . 265-7 179-1 173-2 149-2 134-4Further education . 25-4 37-2 49-2 49-8 48-3Teacher training   . 3-4 3-0 3-0 3-0 3-0Universities .      . 31-6 27-0 31-1 46-9 59-5326-1   246-3   256-5   248-9  245-2Youth service andlocal libraries    .    13-9    14-3    14-3    14-3    14-3schools (england)11. As the table in paragraph 7 shows, thenumber of teachers in service is expected to rise from 374,000 in 1972-73 to 441,000 in 1976-77.This rate of growth will reduce the number of pupils per teacher from 21-4 to 19-5. While thenumber of primary pupils is expected to fall byabout 150,000 over the period, the number of secondary pupils will rise by nearly 700,000; ofthis increase, 182,000 is attributable to raising theschool leaving age.12. The forecasts of expenditure are mainlyrelated to the teacher and pupil numbers but also provide for improvement factors in non-teachingcosts of 3 per cent in 1972-73 and in subsequent years.13. The building programme starts not only take account of the changes in the school populationbut also provide for the replacement and improvement of old primary schools at the ratepreviously agreed by Ministers namely, at newcost limits,  46-1 million in 1972-73 and  50-million in each of the subsequent years. Thestarts for 1972-73 and 1973-74 include thespecial provision of  6-6 million for the infra&apos;structure works programme.14. The Departments original proposals forstarts in 1976-77 included provision for the fore-cast increase of 27,000 primary school pupilsbetween January 1978 and January 1979. In theTreasury&apos;s view, however, no such provision is needed since the figure forecast for January 1979is still below the peak figure in January 1973.While not agreeing that all the accommodationprovided for the 1973 peak will remain availablein 1979, the Department accepts that there aretechnical problems arising from a situation with-out precedent which call for further discussionwith the Treasury. In the meantime the startsfigure for basic needs has been reduced to thelevel ( 71-5 million) where no provision is madefor primary growth.15. The Department put forward proposals forstarts on the building of special schools rising, at1972 Survey prices, from  15 million in 1973-74to  19-5 million in 1976-77 on the grounds thatthe provision was necessary to enable local educa-tion authorities by the end of the decade todischarge their statutory duty to provide the places needed for the handicapped pupils, for whom they had responsibility prior to April1971, given the latest evidence on the incidence of specific handicaps. The proposals for theeducation of severely mentally handicapped children in the former training centres and in hospitals were based on the most recent assess-ment of the resources needed to meet basicrequirements only. The Treasury consider that,as programmes in the past were not based onany defined policy, any increase above the levelin Cmnd. 4829 would constitute a policy change and that the starts figures&apos; should remain con-sistent  with  those  in  Cmnd.  4829,   which
at 1972 Survey prices were  11-9 million in1973-74 rising to  14 million in 1976-77; theestimates in the present Survey have been calculated accordingly. The Department does notconsider, however, that the higher figuresconstitute anything more than a revised estimateof the cost of existing policy.16. The starts figures in each year include  0-1 million transferred from the Department ofHealth and Social Security in respect of hospitalschools.further education (england and wales)17. The current expenditure estimates and thebuilding programmes are based on the studentnumbers (full-time equivalents) set out in the table in paragraph 7. The fall in 1973-74 iscaused by the effect of raising the school leaving age. Thereafter the numbers rise to 768,000, anincrease of 55,000 over the five-year period. Theprogramme includes a small margin for residen-tial and social accommodation.teacher training (england and wales)18. No provision is made for an increase in thenumber of students. The building programme isintended to provide only for the replacement ofthe worst of the existing buildings.universities (great britain)19. The forecasts of student numbers are thesame as those underlying Cmnd. 4829 and reflect the rate of growth of expenditure agreed by ministers in 1971. The increased building startsin 1975-76 allow for the resumption of theprovision of science places, after two programmes which will include only a few, as a result of a revised planning assumption of a lower per-centage of science students. Science places costnearly twice as much as those for the arts.youth service and local libraries20. Apart from capital grants to voluntaryyouth projects, these programmes are no longercontrolled by the Department: since 1 April1971, they have come within the locally deter-mined sector of local authority capital programmes. Pending outturn information of theway in which local authorities have exercisedtheir new freedom, the figures represent a con-continuation in 1976-77 of the level agreed in Cmnd.4829 up to 1975-76, with the difference that thelocal libraries figure has been reduced to take account of the arrangement under which the localmuseums figure will now appear in the Artsprogramme.libraries21. The British Museum Library will form partof the British Library and the former provision on the Arts programme has been transferred tothe Education and libraries programme.Similarly, provision for the Royal GeographicalSociety and the British Institute of RecordedSound has been transferred from the Artsprogramme.comparison with cmnd. 482922.

The forecasts of capital expenditure providefor school building starts as follows:  million at 1972 Survey prices1972-73    1973-74    1974-75    1975-76    1976-7719 1        13-1        11-4 8-5 8-526. The programme is designed to provide forthe growth and movement of school population,for the replacement of substandard 19th-centuryprimary schools and, in 1972-73, for the raising of the school leaving age. The starts for 1972-73and 1973-74 include the special provision of 3-4 million for the infrastructure works programme.27. At the Treasury&apos;s request the total starts forspecial schools have been restricted to the present level of  0 - 5 million a year. In the Departmentsview this figure is insufficient to provide the required number of places and it is estimatedthat additional starts totalling  3-6 million overthe period from 1973-74 to 1976-77, would berequired for that purpose.28. The overall level of current expenditure is determined mainly by numbers of pupils and teachers, which are expected to show trends in wales similar to those in England. Between1972-73 and 1976-77 total primary pupil num-bers are expected to fall by 6 per cent while,partly as a result of raising the school leaving age, the number of secondary pupils is expectedto increase by 17 per cent. It is estimated thatthe number of pupils per teacher in Welshprimary schools will fall from 23 in 1972-73 toabout 22 in 1976-77. Although raising theschool leaving age will cause a temporary set-back, staffing standards in Welsh secondary schools are expected to improve over the period as a whole; the number of pupils per teachershould fall from 17 in 1972-73 to 15 in 1976-77.comparison with cmnd. 482929.

Where appropriate, they reflect theincreased cost limits operating from 1 April1972.)schools32. Forecasts of current expenditure arerelated to an increase in pupil numbers of about per cent and an increase in the number of teachers of about 12 per cent. The number of teachers available for primary work is expectedto be sufficient to allow the recently announcedstaffing standards in primary schools of oneteacher to 25 pupils to be achieved by about1975-76. Until the results of the review of futurestaffing standards have been fully considered, the forecast of secondary school teachers will con-tinue to be determined by the number of teacherslikely to become available.33. Apart from the substantial demand for newplaces caused by the shift of population, newschool places are required mainly for the increas-ing secondary school population including, in1972-73, the increase resulting from raising the57
school leaving age. The programme also includes provision for replacement and improve-ment, mainly of primary school accommodation,and in 1972-73 starts of  14-7 million under thespecial infrastructure works programme. Thetotal starts for special schools have been restricted by the Treasury to the present level of  1-9million a year. The Department regard this figure as inadequate for the additional needs nowidentified and for the urgent need to improveexisting inadequate provision for which theyestimate that additional starts totalling about 4-7 million (gross) are required over the period from 1974-75 to 1976-77.further education34. The forecasts reflect the estimated demandfor courses at all levels and expected increasesover the period of 17 per cent in the total numberof students and about 20 per cent in the numberof teachers.

The fall in the number of students over theperiod is a consequence of the expected stabilisation-tion of staffing standards in primary schools from1975-76.other services36. Forecasts for university awards reflect the expected growth in the number of Scottishstudents   qualifying   for   awards   (28,340   in1971-72 and 36,380 in 1976-77, an increase of nearly 21 per cent). This item includes alsoexpenditure on social and recreational education,and the library service. Expenditure on meals and milk is expected to fall from  11-2 million in 1972-73 to  10-5 million in 1976-77 mainlyas a consequence of the increased school mealcharge in 1973.comparison with cmnd. 4829 (scotland)37.

Provision for the Scottish central services is included under other Central Services and grants.Coverage1. There have been no changes in coverage since cmnd. 4829, but some  1 million has beentransferred over the three years 1972-75 to the urban Programme in England and Wales for daycare projects in areas of high social need.Basis of the Table2. For the first four years of the quinquenniumthe figures in Cmnd. 4829 have been revalued.These include the additional  118 million agreed in 1971 which is largely self-liquidating and withspecific agreed exceptions does not affect thefigures for 1976-77. The main policy change is the decision, subject to passage of the necessary legislation, to pay in the course of 1972-73 all outstanding compensation due to general medical practitioners for loss of the right to sell the good-will of their medical practices when they entered the NHS in 1948. The Great Britain provisionover the four years to 1975-76 is thereforeincreased by  1-8 million over the total amountof  5-7 million already provided in Cmnd. 4829.The estimates for capital expenditure on personal social services in England and Wales have been increased by  1 million in the first year and 4 million in the second following the transfer offinancial responsibility for some voluntaryapproved schools to local authorities under theChildren and Young Persons Act 1969; loans raised by voluntary organisations are not classified as public expenditure, and to the extent that theirrepayment will be carried out by local authoritiesthey are included in the figures for the first time. The main estimating changes indicateincreased expenditure on family practitioner ser-vices ( 3-3 million in the first year,  3-5 million in the second,  1-4 million in the third and 2-9 million in the fourth) see paragraph 10below; and new assessments of the apportionmentof administration costs between the social security and Health and personal social servicesprogrammes (an average increase of some 3 million in each of the first four years withsome compensating reduction on the social security programme). The net result is that thewhole programme for Great Britain shows thefollowing increases:  million at 1972 Survey prices1972-73	1973-74	1974-75	1975-7613-9	13-2	6-9	8-1
Manpower3. The manpower forecasts for the health and personal social services are in keeping with the developments foreshadowed in Cmnd. 4829. Thetotal for this programme is planned to rise from954,000 at the beginning of 1972-73 to 1,102,000at the end of 1976-77. Over the period the total increase will be about 15 per cent, but the increases in the various services will reflect the emphasis given to development of the serviceand the limitations on the numbers likely to beavailable. In the personal social services, which now take up about 15 per cent of the total, theincrease in manpower over the period is estimated to be some 35 per cent. In NHS hospitals (now about 70 per cent of the total) and in the com-munity health services (now 7 per cent of thetotal) numbers are expected to increase by about12 per cent and 14 per cent respectively. Theincrease in general medical and dental prac-practitioners (now about 4 per cent of the total) isexpected to be about 5 per cent a rate of increase which exceeds the forecast growth in population over the period.Implications of PAR4. A two-stage PAR study of services for the elderly is to be completed at the end of 1972. Itis therefore too early to take account in this pro-gramme of its possible implications for different services.Implications for major services. The following paragraphs set out the implications-tions of the figures in Table 20 for the mainhealth and personal social services.Hospital building programme.  The programme is controlled as a blockbudget.   The figures included for advances to hospital authorities for the basic building pro-gramme, and the special additions, are:  million at 1972 Survey prices1973-74        1974-75        1975-76        1976-771972-73EnglandBasic programme..... 159-5 160-5 159-7 160-3 160-3Regional infrastructure..... 9-5 3-6  -                 1971 addition ( 118 million) .      ... 1-2 8-8 11-8 8-5              -Total...... 170-2 172-9 171-5 168-8 160-3WalesBasic programme...... 7-7 7-4 7-4 9-4 9-4Regional infrastructure.      .... 1-4 0-5   -  1971 addition ( 118 million) .      ... 0-3 0-9 1-3 0-3 -Total...... 9-4 8-8 8-7 9-7 9-4ScotlandBasic programme...... 22-6 22-2 22-3 22-0 22-1Regional infrastructure.      .... 2-4 0-4      1971 addition ( 118 million) .      ... 0-2 1-1 1-5 1-2 0-3Total...... 25-2 23-7 23-8 23-2 22-4Total Great Britain .      .      .      . 204-8 205-4 204-0 201-7 192-17. The basic programme for 1976-77 is broadly the same as the preceding year. The reduction of 10 million in the total is entirely accounted forby the termination of the special additions. Thetotal in that year remains higher in real termsthan that for 1971-72, largely on account of the continuation of the increases made in 1970.8. These resources will be devoted in the mainto the programme of replacing or improving out-of-date hospitals and services particularly those tosuch categories as are mentioned at paragraph 9below, to providing hospitals in newly-populated areas and to establishing modern patterns of service, including/assessment, day-hospital ,and special treatment facilities, as well as in-patientbeds. During the five years 1972-73 to 1976-77nearly 160 schemes costing over  1 million shouldbe completed on present plans. It is estimatedthat something of the order of one-fifth of expen-diture will be on making substantial improve-ments to buildings, plant and equipment in hospitals which will remain in service for manyyears, and on making minor improvements toother hospitals. It is not planned that the endresult should be an increase in the total number
of beds, but an improvement in the quality anddistribution of all services. Over the survey period this will result in replacing or improvingabout one-tenth of existing hospital facilities.Hospital current expenditure. This is a block budget covering advances to hospital authorities, and it takes up over half thetotal public expenditure on health and personal social services. The 3  per cent increase in real terms each year allowed for in Cmnd. 4829 hasbeen continued into 1976-77. In that year thereis also an agreed addition continuing from the 118 million of:  millionEngland       ......     4-4Wales.........     0-3Scotland       ......     0-4mainly for improvements to services for mentally ill patients and the elderly. Approximately one-quarter of the additional expenditure provided forin the programme is necessary to maintain theexisting standard of service for the increasing andageing population. The remainder, together withsavings arising from improvements in efficiency and redevelopment of resources, will enableimprovements in the standard in hospital services generally, with continued particular emphasis onimprovement of conditions and treatment in services for such patients as the mentally handi-capped and mentally ill, the elderly and the younger chronic sick. There will be a progressive reduction in the relative inequalities in resources available between regions, and some progress towards meeting unsatisfied need.Family practitioner services10. The figures for general medical, dental and ophthalmic services and the pharmaceutical services are the best available forecasts of likely expendi-ture: they take account of numbers of doctors and dentists; volume and costs of treatments andprescriptions; and policy on charges. the changes from the figures in Cmnd. 4829 take account of more general practitioners; greaterexpansion in the numbers of doctors working in health centres; and some increase in the propor-tion of dental treatments provided without charge to patients in the priority classes.11. The current forecasts assume that in real terms prescription charges (at present 20p an item for most items) will remain constant, that isthey will be regularly increased as costs rise; that present exemptions from pharmaceutical chargeswill remain unchanged; that in the dental servicelegislation to reduce the upper age limit of exemp-tion from dental charges to 18 years will Havebeen set in hand to reduce expenditure from the mid-point of 1973-74. They imply that over thefive-year period to 1977 there will be an increasein the number of:(i) doctors from 24,400 to 25,500;(ii) dentists from 12,100 to 12,600;and that in the same period the ratio of popula-tion to doctors will go down from 2,210 to about,170 a reduction of nearly 2 per cent.Local authority servicesCapital12. The bulk of capital expenditure by localauthorities on health and personal social services is controlled centrally under &quot; key sector&quot;arrangements in England and Wales and throughborrowing consents in Scotland. The followingamounts are agreed additions for 1976-77 only,accepted as a supplement to the  118 millionagreed last year:  millionEngland       ......     7-wales.........     0-scotland       ......       These resources will be devoted in the main toreplacing and improving out-of-date and unsuit-able premises (notably old work-houses) and providing new and additional accommodationneeded in the programmes. It is estimated thatthe proposed capital provision over the period would allow construction of something like thefollowing projects, although developments will notnecessarily follow this pattern:56,000 places in homes for the elderly oryounger physically handicapped;12,500 places in hostels for the mentally handi-capped or mentally ill;9,000 places in ordinary children&apos;s homes;2,750 places in children&apos;s homes with special facilities;300 day centres for the elderly or physicallyhandicapped providing accommodation at any one time for perhaps 15,000persons;5,000 places at occupational and day centres for the mentally ill or mentally handi-capped;        /8,500 places at day nurseries or day centres for children; and500 health centres.Current13. The forecasts take account of the 1970 rate support Grant settlements for -1971-72 and1972-73. The figures for 1973-74 to 1975-76inclusive are broadly the Cmnd. 4829 figuresrevalued, and the rates of growth assumed forprojecting the personal social services figures from
1975-76 to 1976-77 have been arbitrarily taken as the basic growth rate implied in the figures forthe previous year, namely 9 per cent for Englandand Wales and 6-1 per cent for Scotland. Aspecial addition of  0-7 million agreed spilloverfrom the  118 million has, however, been madeto the social work figure for Scotland in that year.More accurate forecasts for the forthcoming years will depend on:(a) the growth rates actually achieved by localauthorities on these services in the currentperiod;(ft) forecasts agreed with local authorities forthe next Rate Support Grant period;(c) realistic forecasts for the remainder of theperiod made in the light of (a) and (ft)above and local authorities&apos; development plans; and(d) the aggregates of the individual forecasts forrecurrent expenditure on all local authority services.The average annual rates of growth reflected inthe Table are:Per centHealth:England and Wales    ......     2-7Scotland ......     ...     4-6Personal social services:England and Wales    ......     9-3Scotland (social work)......     7-5A combined figure is given for England andWales as they form part of the same rate support Grant negotiations and settlements.14. The Scottish Education Department pointout that the development of local authority per-sonal social services in Scotland (which includeprobation and after-care) is behind that inEngland and Wales and that the rate of futured development will depend in part on the provision made in this Survey. Having regard (a) to thegreater encouragement being given to these services and (ft) to the greater provision for theirgrowth in England and Wales which, because of reorganisation and reallocation of departmental responsibilities became fully apparent only on completion of the 1971 Survey, the Departmentconsider that the figures should be amended toprovide for the same estimated growth ratethroughout Great Britain.15. The Treasury comment that proper decisions on growth rates for related services in England,Wales and Scotland should take account inter aliaof the varying balances between hospital and community care in the three countries. In par-ticular they add that the growth rates for allcurrent local authority health and personal social services will require Ministerial decisions whenthe more accurate forecasts mentioned above areavailable. Meanwhile neither the Treasury northe Departments are committed to any of thefigures after 1972-73.

The figures for each year from 1974-75 onwards include the usual amount of  2  million which is available for the minor adjustments to the schemes which are needed between the upratings. In 1972-73 and in 1973-74 this amount has beenreduced by  1-0 million and  1-4 million respectively, and war pensions expenditure correspondingly increased, onaccount of arrears of benefit in respect of war pensioners in psychiatric hospitals.
Policy assumptions1. The programme is a projection of the social security programme underlying Cmnd. 4829 as modified by subsequent Ministerial decisions. on some points, however, the Department of health and Social Security have reservations (see para-graph 11).Upratings2. The policy underlying Cmnd. 4829 was thatthere would be upratings on 1 October 1973 and1 October 1975. The uprating in October 1973was to compensate for the movement of pricessince the previous uprating (in September 1971)and to give a real terms increase of 60 per cent of the difference between the movement of prices and earnings, less the amount of the real improve-ment given in September 1971. On presentassumptions about the movements of prices and earnings this would have resulted in an upratingof 17-3 per cent, which would have represented a real terms increase of 2-4 per cent. the uprating in October 1975 was assumed to be in line with the movement of earnings since October1973, but this was to give Ministers a full range of options, not to imply a settled policy forupratings after 1973.3. It has now been decided that upratings shouldbe annual, not biennial, that from 1973 onwardsthey should take place in the latter half ofNovember, and that there should be a 12-5 percent uprating on 2 October 1972. This upratingwill give a real terms increase of 5-7 per cent over September 1971 on present assumptions about the movement of prices. As Ministers havenot yet considered the amount of the upratings in1973 and subsequent years in the light of this increase, provision has been included on theassumption that each of the upratings in 1973,1974 and 1976 will be in line with the movementof prices since the previous uprating and that the uprating in 1975 will be in line with the move-ment of prices since the 1974 uprating plus themovement of real earnings since the 1973uprating. The date of uprating in each of thefour years is assumed to be 16 November.Family allowances4. Family allowances are assumed to remainfixed in money terms throughout the period ofthe Survey. It has, however, been agreed by ministers that at the appropriate time it would bepossible to consider claims on the contingency reserve for up to  15 million a year to provide additional help for poor families.Family income supplement5. Family income supplement is a new benefit which started in August 1971. Because of difficulty about estimating the number of familiesCONFIDENTIALwho would claim and uncertainty about the way in which the benefit would develop, Cmnd. 4829included an indicative figure of  7 million foreach year after 1971-72. In April 1972 the qualifying income levels were raised broadly in line with the expected movement of earnings since August 1971 to prevent a fall-off in the numbersof qualifying families as earnings rose. although there is no settled policy to uprate family income supplement annually, it has been assumed forillustrative purposes, as in Cmnd. 4829, that expenditure on the benefit will remain at a fixedlevel in real terms throughout the period of the survey.Earnings-related supplement to short-term benefits6. To help finance the 1972 uprating the earningsceiling up to which graduated contributions are payable will be raised from  42 to  48, and theupper limit of the earnings band over whichearnings-related supplement to short-term benefitsis payable at the 15 per cent rate will be extended,from  42 to  48 similarly. For the upratings from1973 onwards it has been assumed that the ceilingfor contributions will be raised each year in line with the movement of earnings. In advance of decisions on the report of the PAR currently inprogress on short-term benefits, it has been assumed that the correspondence between the twolimits will continue. For the same reason nochange has been assumed in the other featureswhich govern the amount of earnings-relatedsupplement the rate of 33  per cent of earnings between  10 and  30, and the rate of 15 per cent of earnings over  30.Reconstruction of national insurance7. The introduction of the reconstructed national insurance scheme is planned for April 1975. the basic structure of the long-term benefits of thescheme will not be changed. Pending decisions onthe forthcoming PAR report, no changes havebeen assumed in the short-term benefits. Thebenefits of the proposed State reserve scheme willnot count as public expenditure and are thereforeexcluded.Supplementary benefit and the reform of housingfinance8. The reform of housing finance is estimated toreduce supplementary benefit expenditure on the rent of beneficiaries in 1972-73 by  80 million from what it would otherwise have been. this estimate is, however, very approximate as fore-casts of the precise effects on the rents of individual beneficiaries are not possible. In theyears after 1972-73 the effect of the reform of housing finance will be a smaller rate of increasein expenditure on rent than would otherwise havebeen the case.65
Tax credits9. In the longer term the tax credit scheme, if adopted, would have important consequences forthe size and composition of the social securityprogramme. For the present it is assumed thatthere would be no effects during the period covered by this Report.Rate of growth of the programme10. The annual rate of growth of theprogramme in real terms, year on year, is asfollows :per cent1972-73	1973-74    1974-75	1975-76	1976-775-5	1-4         0-1	1-7	2-6The average annual rate of growth of the pro-gramme in real terms over the period from1971-72 is 2-3 per cent. This figure reduces to1-4 per cent if purely demographic factors are excluded and improvements in standards onlyare taken into account.Reservations by the Department of Health and social Security11. The Departments reservations are asfollows:UPRATINGSThe provision made for each of the upratings in1973, 1974 and 1976 does no more than enablethe purchasing power of benefits to be restored to what it was after the uprating in thepreceding year. The DHSS view is that thisprovision is inadequate and that it is quiteunrealistic for any measure of real termsimprovement to be omitted. Over recent years the pension has been declining in its relation-ship to average earnings, and this process,which will continue on the programme set out above, ought to be arrested and reversed. Inthe opinion of the DHSS entry to EECreinforces this view since we compare unfavour-ably with most e.c. countries both as to thelevel of pension and as to the rate of periodicincreases. The DHSS consider that the appro-priate provision is for benefits to be increased at each uprating at least in line with the move-ment of earnings since the previous uprating.Upratings in line with the movement of earnings would add to the programme asfollows:  million at 1972 Survey prices1973-74     1974-75     1975-76     1976-7741-4 145-9        171-5        158-0maternity grant and death grantIt was agreed in 1970 that maternity grant and death grant should remain fixed in cashterms for the five years of the 1970 Surveyprogramme. In Cmnd. 4829 this process was continued and no provision made for any increase in the grants at the 1975 uprating. Inthe view of the DHSS it may be difficult toallow these benefits to continue to decline in real terms beyond 1975 (maternity grant beinglast increased in 1969 and death grant in 1967)and that the programme should include pro-vision for a restoration of purchasing power atthe 1975 uprating. This would cost  7 million in 1975-76 and  18 million in 1976-77.selective improvements in the view of the DHSS the programme oughtto include some margin for making selectiveimprovements in the schemes. Examples ofsuch improvements are: the extension of benefitprovision for the disabled, notably the disabledhousewife; further development of variousselective improvements already introduced; araising of the amounts of income which aredisregarded in assessing supplementary benefit;and expenditure arising from the recommenda-tions of the Finer Committee on one-parent families, which is due to report by the end ofthe year.FAMILY SUPPORTFamily allowances are assumed to decline in real terms by 40 per cent by 1976-77 comparedwith 1971-72, the only provision against this being the  15 million which Ministers haveagreed might be made available from the con-contingency reserve. In the view of the DHSS itcannot be assumed ^that this will be adequate for necessary expenditure on family supportbefore the tax credit scheme is introduced.

Just over half the total is for the InlandRevenue with smaller sums for Customs and excise, the Department of the Environment, theDepartment of Health and Social Security andlocal authorities. The main reason for theincrease in expenditure in 1972-73 and 1973-74is the build-up of an extra 6,000 Customs staff to administer VAT. In the later years theestimates allow for an increase in Inland Revenuestaff for the earnings related national insurancescheme, offset to some extent by the run-down of Surtax staff.Royal Mint2. The estimates for the Royal Mint representthe cost of provision of United Kingdom coinrequirements. Variations in the figures from year to year arise principally from the availability of metal from withdrawn coin and from expectedsales of United Kingdom proof sets and recoveredsilver.3. The estimates allow for expenditure (totalling 2-2 million) in the equipping of Phase Two ofthe new Mint in South Wales, replacing theTower Hill Mint. Estimated building costs forthe completion of the new Mint, totalling  2-5 million are included in the Other financialadministration, etc., figures in the Table above( 1-0 million in 1972-73,  1-25 million in1973-74 and  0-25 million in 1974-75).Post-war credits4. The figures reflect the decision to repay post-war credits in the course of 1972 and 1973.Other financial administration, etc.5. About  20 million of the expenditure relates to the National Savings Department; also included is the cost of the Treasury, the cost ofnote issue and management of the national debtcarried out by the Bank of England for theTreasury, and the Bank&apos;s capital expenditure.CONFIDENTIAL67

The capital expenditure on major new worksunder this programme is confined mainly to office accommodation for the Home Civil Service.Major capital expenditure on most specialisedbuildings, expenditure on research and the rentsof specialised buildings have been attributed tothe relevant public expenditure programmes. Thepolicy changes involving capital expenditure areaccounted for chiefly by the decision announced in Parliament on 1 December 1971 not to proceedt  million at 1972 Survey prices with six Inland Revenue Computer Centres onwhich building work has/not yet started. A smallprovision has been included for work on employ-ment exchanges to implement the new policy setout in &quot; People and Jobs&quot;. There have been some increases in the cost of carrying out theremaining programme, partly due to changes inthe phasing and plans of some big schemes.2. During the Survey period a start will bemade on several large office developments, and provision is made for  Crown buildings at
Department. During the year the adoption ofaccountable management techniques will be examined.Central Computer Agency6. Responsibility for the acquisition of com-puters for Government Departments was trans-ferred on 1st April 1972 from HMSO to theCentral Computer Agency, part of the CivilService Department. Apart from salaries, expen-diture covers the purchase, hire and maintenanceof computers and associated equipment. The useof computers produces improvements in efficiency and savings in staff thus reducing costs in other programmes. In the light of more recent informa-tion expenditure is expected to be slightly lower than in Cmnd. 4829, revalued.Information (Home)7. Forecasts which Departments made of their home publicity requirements have been reducedby an overall adjustment for realism. The pro-visions for the years 1972-73 to 1975-76 arebetween  1*0 million and  1*2 million above those in Cmnd. 4829 revalued. This is becauseadditional provision has been taken for continuingexpenditure on the Road Safety Campaign, subjectto review after 1972-73 in the context of a PARstudy, and for publicity for Value-added Tax.For the last two years of the quinquennium the programmes for the Metrication Board andValue-added Tax are expected to be phased out.24.

Inaddition provision is made for an increase of 1-5 million a year to  4-5 million in the pro-gramme for building local offices.3. It has proved necessary to increase theestimates for rents in the light of better know-ledge of the space requirements, and the location of the staff being accommodated.4. Maintenance and running costs show substan-tial reductions compared with Cmnd. 4829revalued. In part this is due to over-estimation inthe White Paper of the cost of maintaining theexisting estate and of the cost of new commit-ments such as the Higher Courts. But it is alsonow expected that it will be possible to achievesubstantial economies in this field by various measures to increase efficiency.Stationery Office (Home)5. HMSO supplies Government departments with their printing, publishing, stationery andoffice machinery, and it also supplies some other public sector bodies. Total provision is higherthan in Cmnd. 4829 revalued in order to cover thegrowth of services, reflecting current trends.Following a review of the organisation of services provided to Government Departments, it has beendecided that HMSO is to remain a separate
Records, registrations and surveys. This includes expenditure by several Govern-ment departments (the Office of population censuses and Surveys, General Register Office(Scotland), Land Registry, Ordnance Survey and minor expenditure in other departments) and a smaller amount of local authority expenditure.The expenditure on Social Surveys, carried outon an allied service basis for Government depart-ments is included.2. Expenditure falls after 1971-72 on completion of the 1971 Census. Decisions havenot yet been taken on a 1976 Census, and no provision is made in the Survey for the estimatedcost of  14 million.British Broadcasting corporation . The investment figures cover the capital requirements of the home broadcasting services,including the construction of UHF stations to transmit programmes on 625 lines in black and white and colour; this will increase UHFcoverage from the present level of about 87 percent to about 94 per cent by the end of 1976.The UHF programme is co-ordinated with,though separately financed from, that of theIndependent Television Authority. The Corpor-ation&apos;s expenditure (capital and current) isfinanced by Government grant which since 1961has been the equivalent of net receipts from saleof licences. The capital expenditure shows nochange compared with that of Cmnd. 4829which followed a comprehensive review of pro-jects. The figures for 1975-76 and 1976-77 areprovisional estimates; detailed requirements have yet to be worked out.Independent Television Authority4. Expenditure covers the capital requirementsof the Authority in providing transmitters andrelay stations to broadcast the programmes of independent television companies; it will extend the coverage of UHF transmissions from about85 per cent to about 94 per cent by the end of1976. The Authority is financed by the rentalswhich it charges to the television companies.The programme is slightly lower than in cmnd. 4829. Under the Sound BroadcastingBill now before Parliament the Authority willbe renamed the Independent broadcasting authority and will also be responsible for theprovision of commercial radio (see below).Commercial radio5. This programme provides for the estimatedcapital cost of transmitters for 40 local com-mercial radio stations, and for the initial stages of the construction of a further 20 stations.Expenditure is subject to the passage of the sound Broadcasting Bill, now before Parliament,under which the Independent broadcasting authority (IBA) will be set up; it will take overthe functions of the Independent television authority, and will also be responsible for theprovision of commercial radio, The IBA&apos;sexpenses on the latter will be financed fromrentals charged to the independent radio com-panies, except in the initial period for which aGovernment loan of up to  2 million will beprovided.Meteorological services. This covers the cost of services providedfor both civil and defence purposes. these estimates for both purposes, which cannot be separately identified, are included in theDefence Budget (Table 1). An equivalentreduction is made to Other military defence(Table 2) in order to include the expenditure inMiscellaneous services.Civil defence. The civil defence forecasts reflect the policyformulated after the review in 1971. Totalexpenditure is maintained at the current level,taking the Survey period as a whole, whileadjustments are being made within that Assuming order to improve the nation&apos;s preparedness.Other miscellaneous services , Nearly half of the amounts shown in the table for this item relate to the net lendingand investment overseas of Cable and WirelessLtd. which is Government owned and which provides international communications and internal telephone systems in a number of over-seas countries. It provides an important linkin the Commonwealth Telecommunicationssystem. The investment plans of the company are subject to review later in the year, and theestimates are therefore provisional.4. The estimates in Table 24 include net receipts of  4-7 million arising mainly in 1972-73 from the sale of assets of the State Manage-ment Districts of Carlisle, Gretna, and Cromarty,which are being wound up.v 5. Otherwise the figures include the costs ofthe Civil Service Department (excluding thecentral computer agency which is included in common services), the Cabinet Office, the Pub-lic Trustee, salaries and administration of theMinistry of Posts and Telecommunications, and civil List annuities and pensions.

The public expenditure estimates for NorthernIreland have been prepared by Northern IrelandDepartments. The forecasts for public expendi-ture are the responsibility of the Northern ireland government coming now under the charge of theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland. The levelof expenditure on these services will continue tobe determined with regard to parity of service inNorthern Ireland and Great Britain taking intoaccount the special needs of Northern Ireland.2. The figures represent those areas of expen-diture which are the formal responsibility of theNorthern Ireland Government and do not include expenditure on such items as defence, external relations and most agricultural support whichare contained in the relevant United Kingdomprogrammes.3. The forecast for 1972-73 shows a substantial increase in expenditure in Northern Irelandcompared with 1971-72 amounting to  60-8million. However the forecasts for the subse-quent years of the Survey show little further increase. The figures for 1972-73 include:special assistance to Harland and Wolff of  14million; creation of the Finance Corporation for northern Ireland at  15 million and the resultsof accelerated programmes following the Cairn-cross Review amounting to  9-2 million.Although the Finance Corporation and Cairn-cross accelerations also affect later years themain impact in expenditure terms falls on 1972-73. The rapidity with which policy is evolvingin Northern Ireland means that the presentforecasts cannot be treated as a firm indicatorof future expenditure; forecasts based on existing policy are, however, a necessary background fora consideration of policy changes. The basis ofthe present forecasts is the subject of further discussion between the Treasury and the Ministryof Finance,

Current expenditure . In this analysis the forecasts of current expenditure on local authority services describedprogramme by programme in the preceding section of Part 2 are brought together. Apartfrom the exceptions noted below, the price basisof the forecasts is identical with that of thecurrent Rate Support Grant Orders.england and wales. The outturn for 1970-71 reflects the actualoutturn submitted by local authorities and is about 15 million, on a Rate Support Grant basis, below that previously forecast. For 1971-72 it isexpected that outturn will in total be broadly in line with previous estimates although substantialvariations are likely for individual services. no information is however yet available from thelocal authorities of their actual expenditure in1971-72. For this reason it has not been possibleto allocate the &quot; efficiency reduction &quot; to services.3. For 1972-73 the individual service figures andthe total reflect the sum of relevant expenditureagreed for the purpose of the 1971 Rate support grant (Increase) (No. 2) Order in November 1971.They therefore take account of the provisions ofthe Courts Act 1971 under which certainresponsibilities have been transferred to centralGovernment on 1 January 1972, and of theEducation (Milk) Act 1971 which withdrew thesupply of free milk in junior schools. The pricebasis of the present forecasts of current expenditure includes the cost of a recent payaward for the police which was not included inthe last Increase Order (an extra  11 million),and the adjustments to a Rate Support Grant basisinclude additional loan charges on education ofabout  8 million arising from a recent decision toincrease the building cost limits. These additions,which will be taken into account in a future rate support Grant Increase Order, are partially offset by a number of minor reductions on other services. In addition, the figures for expenditureon police take account of manpower forecastswhich are higher than those accepted for the mainRate Support Grant Order.4. With the exception of Health and personal social services, the forecasts for the individual services for the subsequent years project forward the expenditure trends which emerged from the1970 Rate Support Grant settlement with the adjustments mentioned in the previous paragraph.In addition, the figures for Miscellaneous local services take account of extra expenditureresulting from local government reorganisation,and also include in 1973-74 an allowance for theeffect on current expenditure of the higher levelcapital expenditure now forecast on sewerage.5. The forecasts for Health and personal social services for 1973-74 to 1975-76 inclusive are broadly the Cmnd. 4829 figures revalued, and therate of growth assumed for projecting the personal social services figure from 1975-76 to1976-77 has been arbitrarily taken as the basicgrowth rate implied in the previous year. more accurate forecasts will depend upon various factors including the growth rate actually achieved by local authorities on those services in thecurrent period. The Treasury consider that thegrowth rates will require Ministerial decisionswhen these more accurate forecasts are available.Meanwhile neither the Treasury nor theDepartment are committed to any of the figuresafter 1972-73.6. The forecasts for all services from 1970-71onwards represent in percentage terms thefollowing rates of growth from year to year:Per cent1971-72       1972-73       1973-74       1974-75       1975-76      1976-77Total current expenditure (Survey basis)   . 4-5 3-6 5-4 4-3 4-1 4-3Total revenue expenditure (RSG basis)     . 5-1 4-4 5-8 5-0 4-7 4-7scotland7. The Scottish figures are generally on a similar basis. The figures for 1970-71 reflect the actualoutturn as submitted by local authorities. Thiswas about  8 million, in Rate Support Grantterms, above the forecasts of expenditure accepted for Rate Support Grant.8. For 1972-73 the forecasts reflect the February1971 Rate Support Grant settlement as increased in February 1972. Additions of about  5 million for roads and lesser amounts for other services have however been included on account of thespecial programme for the relief of unemployment.The police pay award and the revision ofeducation building cost limits have resulted in further additions of  1-2 million and  0-6 million respectively.v 9. The forecasts for 1973-74 onwards generallyproject forward the expenditure trends which emerged from the Rate Support Grant settlement.Account is however taken of the transfer from1973-74 of certain responsibilities from the localauthorities to the Central Government under theprovisions of the Sheriff Courts (Scotland) Act

Starting with the financial year 1971-72, thearrangements for controlling capital expenditure by local authorities in England and Wales havebeen significantly changed, and the table reflectsthese changes. Full details of the new arrange-ments are set out in circulars 2/70 and 66/71of the Department of the Environment (116/70and 138/71 Welsh Office) but their broad outlinesare as follows.12. Capital expenditure is now divided into two categories. &quot; Key sector &quot; schemes remain subjectto specific approval by departments.   However,land acquisition associated with such schemes inthe fields of education, local authority housing and principal roads, no longer requires approvalsince it is assumed to be related to approvedprogrammes of. new construction in these fields;and slum clearance under parts II and III of theHousing Act 1957, improvements under theHousing Act 1969, and the purchase of buses bymunicipal transport undertakings, have also beendeemed free of control for the time being. Withinthe remaining &quot; locally determined &quot; sector localauthorities are free to incur capital expendituresubject to an overall annual limit on payments;within their annual allocations, authorities candetermine their own priorities between projectsCONFIDENTIAL 75
and services. Over or under spending in anyone year up to a limit of 10 per cent of theallocation is allowed provided that the amount inquestion is charged against or added to theallocation for the succeeding year. In the case of counties, the allocation covers both the countycouncils and the district councils, and it is forthe authorities within the county jointly todetermine how the allocation is to be applied.13. To arrive at the total of the allocations to authorities it is necessary to make adjustments tothe public expenditure estimates shown in the table. Forecast expenditure from revenue andfrom capital funds is deducted since this expendi-ture does not count against authorities&apos; alloca-tions. An addition is made on account of knowndiscrepancies between the capital paymentsreturns of local authorities and their final accountfigures (e.g. variations in treatment as betweencapital and revenue) and allowance has also to bemade for the fact that the allocation is made atestimated outturn prices.14. Individual allocations for locally determinedschemes are calculated largely by formula, and authorities are advised of their formula allocationin advance of the beginning of the financial year in order that they may have adequate time to plantheir capital expenditure programmes. Theamount allocated by formula for 1972-73 is lessthan that implied in the forecasts in the SpecialAnalysis in the 1971 Survey Report as a resultof a reduction since the preparation of thoseforecasts in the proportion of capital expenditure which is locally determined. As foreshadowed in last year&apos;s Report the breakdown betweenkey and locally determined sectors has been reviewed in the light of experience. It hasbecome clear that some services such as coastprotection, the provision of magistrates courts and the reclamation of derelict land, which areundertaken only by certain authorities, do notfit readily into a system of control based onannual allocations and they have beentransferred to the key sector for 1972-73onwards. This loss has been only partiallyoffset by the transfer of some expenditure fromthe key to the locally determined sector andthe result has been a net reduction in expenditure which is locally determined.15. One of the main objectives in introducing a locally determined sector was to give localauthorities greater freedom to decide prioritieswithin this area. Until a final outturn for1971-72 is available and has been analysed itis not possible to be certain how local authoritieshave applied this freedom. The breakdownbetween services within the &quot; locally determined &quot;category still partly reflects therefore depart-mental estimates of what local authorities would have been likely to have spent had theprevious loan sanction control arrangementsremained unchanged. It is possible that infuture Surveys the breakdown may need to be substantially modified to reflect local authorities&apos;actual decisions.scotland16. There has been no change so far in the overall arrangements for controlling capitalexpenditure by local authorities in Scotland,although a pilot scheme with a small numberof authorities is under consideration. The table below simply draws together the forecasts ofexpenditure by Scottish local authorities includedin the functional tables, and the provisosregarding accuracy of the breakdown betweenservices do not apply.Capital expenditure of local authoritiesScotland   million at 1972 Survey prices1970-71    1971-72    1972-73    1973-74 1974-75    1975-76    1976-77outturn   provisional estimate    estimate estimate    estimate    estimateoutturn1.		23-8	32-1	36-1	39-1	39-5	41-3	44-92.

4.  Beneficiaries of public expenditure . The ultimate purpose of public expenditure isto benefit and assist individual persons, particularorganised sections or institutions, or the com-munity at large. This special analysis seeks toclassify expenditure by broad categories ofbeneficiary.2. A major part of public expenditure is intendedto benefit individual persons. There is, forexample very considerable expenditure in theform of direct cash payments of social security benefits, and to a less extent redundancy fundpayments. Certain subsidies reduce the price of specific goods and services purchased by indi-viduals. A wide range of services (the major onesbeing the health and education services) are provided free of charge, or at a price well belowcost, for individuals with specific needs. Finally,many amenities are provided, such as parks andart galleries which the individual may enjoy as amember of the public either free of charge or fora small payment.3. The second category of beneficiary from public expenditure comprises businesses of onesort or another, in commerce, industry and agri-culture. Their benefit can be measured only in financial terms, in terms of grants, subsidies andadvantage of free provision of goods and services.Much of the expenditure of the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Depart-ment of Trade and Industry falls into this category.4. Thirdly, there are services which are ofgeneral benefit to both individuals and the institutions within the country. Defence and themaintenance of law and order are clearly ofgeneral benefit. Similarly commerce and industryand the private individual are both served by theroads and water and sewerage systems and itis not possible to apportion the cost betweenthem.5. Finally some expenditure is intended for bene-beneficiaries overseas. Overseas aid is the majorexpenditure of this kind.6. Clearly the identification of benefit is not asclear-cut as this. For example the education services which benefit the individual also providecommerce and industry with an educated, skilled labour force. On the other hand assistance to industry may benefit individuals by providing employment. However, the analysis attempts toshow the immediate beneficiary, and this is inmost cases the prime beneficiary.7. The table on page 82 sets out the allocation ofexpenditure in each of the functional programmes to the four categories. The notes below the table give details of the allocation made. the table shows that over half of public expenditure is aimed at providing (in the main quite specific)benefits for persons. This expenditure on personswill have a redistributive effect. Within that total the following are the main expenditures directedentirely or substantially to those with lowerincomes:  million	1971-72	1976-77Legal aid      .      .	26	39Housing subsidies  .	395	343Retirement pensions	2,211	2,780Supplementary benefits	708	607Old persons pensions	25	15Family income supplement	5	10	3,370	3,794and the following to those who may be expected		to be in at least temporary financial difficulty:				  million	1971-72	1976-77Redundancy fund payments	68	48Unemployment benefit	265	208Sickness and invalidity benefit .	457	592	790	848These two groups of expenditure represent 33 percent of expenditure on &quot; Persons&quot; in 1971-72(18 per cent of expenditure on programmes).Their annual average growth rate is 2-2 per cent between 1971-72 and 1976-77.8. Expenditure directed towards commerce, agri-culture and industry has three main components.Within the wide range of assistance provided bythe Department of Trade and Industry, the largestitem in 1971-72 is investment grants ( 442million) but this falls away to only  19 million in 1976-77. The remainder of the expenditure(except for a small amount on R and D) representsselective specific assistance to particular regions,industries or companies. This expenditureincreases from  626 million in 1971-72 to 662 million in 1976-77 after excluding refinanceof export and shipbuilding credit. Second thereis the nationalised industries capital expenditure,which increases at an average annual rate of4-7 per cent over that period. Third there is the
expenditure on support of agriculture, fisheries and forestry. This will decline with the substan-tial withdrawal of the deficiency paymentsscheme, as the changeover to the Common Agri-cultural Policy takes place. Overall, expenditureon commerce, agriculture and industry will declineat an average annual rate of 0 -1 per cent between1971-72 and 1976-77 (excluding refinance ofcredits).9. Expenditure giving general nationwidebenefit represents 29 per cent of expenditure onprogrammes in 1971-72. Its growth is due largely to the rapidly expanding spending on infrastruc-ture works, roads, water and sewerage, and onlaw and order.10. Finally the expenditure directed to overseasbeneficiaries, although the smallest in absolute terms, has the highest average annual growth rate(14-6 per cent). The effect of the e.c. contribu-tion is untypical in so far as there was no payment in 1971-72, but from 1973 onwards the&quot; overseas &quot; expenditure will still enjoy by far thehighest growth rate (9-8 per cent a year between1973-74 and 1976-77).CONFIDENTIAL81

5. Impact on family incomes of Government measures1. The purpose of this analysis is to assess the impact on family incomes of the measures whichthe Government has so far taken in the fields ofpublic expenditure and direct taxation. estimates have also been made of the effects of movements in earnings and prices on the purchasing power of net family incomes. Taken as a whole, the figuresgive an indication of the extent to which thefinancial position of various families has improved since October 1970.2. The present analysis is an extension of thatwhich appeared in Part Two of the 1971 PESCReport. It consists of three tables. Table 1 is substantially the same as the one which appeared in the 1971 Report, and shows the impact of themeasures which took effect between October 1970and October 1971 on family incomes as they stood in the autumn of 1971. The only additions to this table are the columns recording payments of rent and rate rebate. Table 2 similarly recordsthe impact of Government measures taking effectbetween October 1971 and October 1972 on family incomes as they are expected to stand inthe autumn of 1972. It is designed as a continuation of the first table. The family incomefigures which appear in the second table are theresult of inflating those (less family allowances)in last year&apos;s table by the expected movement inthe earnings index between autumn 1971 andautumn 1972. The second table follows thesame format as the first, except that the columnswhich recorded the 1970-71 changes inprescription charges, dental and ophthalmiccharges, and the child tax allowance, have been omitted as there have been no changes in these items in the second period, and no further effectsarise as a result &quot;of inflating the particular incomebands. The third table shows how retirement pensioners have fared between 1970 and 1972.3. In Table 1, the increases in prescription charges and ophthalmic and dental charges areweekly averages of the whole non-exemptpopulation. The cost to a family in any weekwhen charges are paid will of course be farhigher. For example, the charge per item on aprescription is 20p. The figures in the rent andrate rebate columns are based on assumptions about levels of rent and rates which rise as the size of the family increases. For example inautumn 1972 the rent assumed for a single adultis  2-22 and rates 80p rising to  3-80 and  1-05for a family with four children. While rent increases will be reflected in the increase in prices which enters into the calculation of column (e)(which represents a measure of the differenceCONFIDENTIALbetween changes in the earnings and pricesindexes) the impact of rent increases in particular cases could be more substantial. It should benoted also that only slightly more than halfof those eligible claim the Family IncomesSupplement.4. Both tables take account of movements in earnings and prices over the period. In eachtable one index for price movements and one for movements in earnings is applied to all the family size and income levels. This may result insome distortion because families at differentincome levels purchase different &quot; shoppingbaskets&quot; which may be affected differently byprice movements. Equally, earnings at different levels may move at varying rates. The retail price index which has been used subsumes theeffects of changes in indirect taxes, but will alsoreflect price changes brought about by other government measures shown on the table; therewill therefore be a very small element of double-counting.5. The tables do not show the effect of increases in rail fares in 1971 following the withdrawal ofthe grant to the London network, or on theother hand of the subsequent grant to cover the losses of the British Railways Board inconforming to price restraint. Tables 1 and 2also do not measure the effect of withdrawingfree school milk in junior schools (7-11 year olds).Increases in retirement pensions and other social security benefits are reflected in Table 3.6. The conclusion of last year&apos;s analysis wasthat the Government^ measures had substantiallyimproved the position of families with children at most income levels, and while the effect of price and earnings increases somewhat improvedthe position of higher wage earners it was truethat the lowest wage earners with childrenbenefited the most. In this year&apos;s analysiscolumn (k) shows that again the Governmenfsmeasures have benefited the lowest wage earnersthe most. However, taking account of all the factors (column (0) the improvement in familyincomes is more evenly spread; but the highestincome levels have benefited the most. This is mainly because the higher income levels achieve a higher absolute increase from the change in earnings and prices (column (e)).7. It is increasingly difficult to attribute changesin net income over a substantial period of time toGovernment measures as compared with other factors affecting these incomes. Overall, over thetwo-year period net incomes will have moved, onthe basis of Tables 1 and 2 as follows.83

For the families with children the lowest income levels gain the most,and those with the highest incomes gainsubstantially; at the middle of the income rangegains are at their lowest. The lowest income levels owe their advantage over the middle ofthe range earners mainly to FIS. In percentage terms the decline as gross income increases ismuch more pronounced than with the singleadults and married couples, but again there is aslight improvement at the highest income level.

Table 1 shows capital expenditure increasingbetween 1971-72 and 1976-77 at an average annual rate of 4-7 per cent in volume ternis,compared with 2-4 per cent for current expendi-ture on programmes. Whereas, however, a positive adjustment has to be made for therelative price effect on current expenditure on goods and services, a negative adjustment isrequired for the majority of capital expenditure.As a result, in cost terms, the rate of increase is4-5 per cent compared with 3-5 per cent for current expenditure.New assets2. The main blocks of expenditure on newassets are grouped together in the following tableinto those undertaken primarily on &quot; Economic &quot;grounds and those undertaken primarily for&quot; Social&quot; purposes.New assetsTABLE 2   million at 1972 Survey pricesAverageannual	1971-72	1976-77	percentage			increaseEconomic services:			Trade, industry and			employment	50	48	-0-8Nationalised industries:			Fuel	785	890	2-5Steel     .      .      .	236	310	5-6Post Office          r	525	662	4-7Air and surface			transport industries	220	311	7-2Less shortfall		-100	Roads	471	766	10-2Total, Economic			services	2,287	2,887	4-8Of which Construction				878	1,239	7-1Plant,   machinery			and vehicles	1,409	1,648	3-2

Whereas nearly all Social investment in newassets takes the form of new construction, well over half of new assets for Economic services is invehicles, plant and machinery, reflecting the differing requirements of the various nationalised industries.4. Overall, a faster rate of increase is planned onEconomic services than on Social investment.This reflects, in the main, relatively high rates of increase on roads and on nationalised industriesexpenditure and the static position on housing and the downturn in investment on Schools. Therate of increase on Roads expenditure, shown inTable 2 is, however, unrepresentative in so far as favourable weather in 1969-70 and 1970-71resulted in the higher than planned expenditurewith a consequence that expenditure in 1971-72was lower than it otherwise would have been.5. Within Economic services, the investment pro-grammes of the nationalised industries are determined principally by commercial con-siderations and reflect expectations of the likelydemand for the goods and services which thedifferent industries produce. The main justifica-tion for the increase in the Roads programme is to minimise the social cost of congestion caused bythe continued growth of traffic. The additional expenditure is required in England to prevent an unacceptable increase in the present level of con-gestion on trunk and principal roads; and inScotland and Wales to modernise the most heavilyused trunk roads.6. There are four main programmes of social investment :(i) housing the figures reflect a decline in expenditure on new dwellings but an offsetting increase inimprovement expenditure.(ii) Miscellaneous local servicesAdditional investment in Water, sewerage and other public health accounts for about three-quarters of the programme. Substan-tial increases are needed in these services inorder to keep pace with rising demands for both domestic and industrial purposes.Investment in the improvement of the environment and local facilities is alsoplanned to increase at a high rate, of nearly5 per cent a year.(iii) Education and librariesThe Schools programme will provide additional places to meet a rising school population partly resulting from the raising of the school-leaving age. However, most ofthe capital expenditure required for the raising of the school-leaving age will havebeen incurred before 1973-74, and there isa substantial decline in the rate of expendi-ture thereafter. The further education programme provides for a continued expansion of student numbers.(iv) Health and personal social services the level of new hospital building, whichaccounts for three-quarters of the capitalexpenditure of this programme, is planned torise by about 2 per cent a year (from  184million in 1971-72 to  204 million in1976-77). A much faster rate of about *6 per cent is planned for local personal social services (from  49 million to 78 million).v 7. Much of this public service investmentproduces no direct financial return. But such a return is obtained on new Housing and on the investment of Nationalised industries. If account is taken also of the relevant Miscellaneous local services (e.g. water supply) about 60 per cent ofall public expenditure on new assets can beclassed as revenue earning.
Capital grants8. The principal capital grants to the private sector (excluding investment grants) are shownin the following table.Capital grantsTABLE 3   million at 1972 Survey pricesAverageannual1971-72  1976-77   percentageincreaseAgriculture .	77	63	-3-9Trade, industry and			employment	42	314	49-5Housing	48	80	10-education and libraries:			Schools and further			education	29	28	-0-7Universities	82	118	7-6Northern Ireland .	51	46	-2-other ....	38	34	-2-2Total*    .	367	683	13-2* Excluding investment grants.9. The common feature of these grant schemesis their aim to stimulate investment in the private sector investment to increase agriculturalefficiency, to provide employment in assisted areas, to improve the housing stock, and so on.In general, no precise estimates are possible of thevolume of new assets created as a result of these schemes, as distinct from the investment thatwould have occurred if the grants had not been paid. In the case of Education the grantsrepresent in effect new building programmes; andare classified as grants rather than as direct invest-ment only because the institutions involved areformally private bodies.Net lending to the private sector10. Most of the lending to the private sectortakes place on the Housing programme. A small part of this goes to subsidised housing associa-tions and serves directly to finance newdwellings. The bulk, however, consists of localauthority loans to private persons for house pur-chase. Most of these loans are used to finance the purchase of existing assets; but there is alimited indirect effect in stimulating new house-building.11. In the Trade, industry and employment pro-gramme a variety of loan schemes are operated asa means of stimulating private investment bothin the assisted areas and in particular industries(e.g. shipbuilding, hotel industry). As with thecapital grants on this programme there &apos; isfrequendy no direct relationship between thevolume of lending and the amount of new assetscreated. The Survey estimates of  12 million(net) in 1971-72 rising to  19 million* in 1976-77are a costing of existing schemes. No provision is made for schemes not yet approved.Other12. This includes changes in stocks as well aslending abroad. The main cause of the increase between 1971-72 and 1976-77 is the rundown of nationalised industries&apos; stocks in the first year.Also the estimates allow for a substantial increasein lending overseas on the Overseas aid pro-gramme.*  44 million if refinancing of shipbuilding credits is included.CONFIDENTIAL89

Tables A and B above show expenditure on research and development extracted from themain expenditure tables; Table A covers the survey year period and Table B gives a more detailed breakdown for the current year. the broad picture is of an increase in R and Dexpenditure in the first half of the period, withreduced spending by the Department of Tradeand Industry (especially on civil aerospace) being more than offset particularly by spending in theDefence Budget and by the Research Councils.The estimates do not take account of any changein R and D organisation which may result fromthe Green Paper &quot; A Framework of government research and Development&quot;; Cmnd. 4814.&apos;2. A short commentary on the main programmesfollows.3. The defence development programme is designed to assist the Services to meet their equip-ment requirements in the most economical and effective way compatible with the budgetary and resources restraints on the equipment programme.These requirements arise from the commitmentsplaced on the Services by the Governmenfsdefence objectives as set out in Chapter One ofthe Statement on the Defence Estimates 1972(Cmnd. 4891). The development programme is divided up under the broad headings of aircraft;guided weapons; electronics; ship construction,naval weapons and equipment, and ordnance andother army equipment. In addition there are anumber of other minor fields of work. The main headings include activities carried out on acollaborative basis with a number of other nations. Details of the main projects involved inthis breakdown are given in Chapter Six of cmnd. 4891. The defence research programme is designed to support the defence development pro-gramme by providing the body of knowledgenecessary to the devising or appraisal of newequipment. The programme, which is controlledCONFIDENTIAL 91
by procedures including an annual review todetermine future trends and possible changes inemphasis, is managed as 19 major fields of research (aerodynamics, aero engines, armoured fighting vehicles, etc.....).4. The entry for Research Councils, etc., com-prises mainly the Science Budget of the Depart-ment of Education and Science. The details ofthis expenditure and its relationship to otherDepartments and to the universities were discussed fully in Cmnd. 4814.5. The Department of Trade and Industry&apos;sprogrammes are mainly directed towards the broad objective of assisting British industry and commerce to improve their economic and technological-logical strength and competitiveness, and there arealso programmes to meet Government require-ments determined by statutory obligations or administrative or operational needs. The fore-casts include expenditure on aircraft and aero-engine projects and assistance (mainly Concordeand RB211); expenditure by government research Establishments and those of the atomic Energy Authority; grants to research associations; other extramural support for industrial technology;  shipping  services;  civilaviation services which remain the responsibilityof DTI after the setting up of the Civil aviation authority; expenditure on national and inter-national space projects; and the United kingdom contribution towards R and D on the tripartitecentrifuge project. There are a number of areasof uncertainty; in particular the sea&apos;s majorreactor programme is under review and future expenditure on civil aircraft and aero-engineprojects are dependent on the decisions resultingfrom Sir Robert marshals report.6. Other Departments&apos; expenditure on R and Dis relatively less significant. The programmes ofthe Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodare concerned mainly with agricultural develop-ment, control of animal and plant pests anddiseases, fisheries research, food science research and botany research.

The figures shown against common services include pension payments to retired civilservants, including former civilian employees ofthe Ministry of Defence.Superannuation3. Table 2 summarises for 1972-73 and 1976-77the transactions of the various pension schemescovering central government and local authorityemployees. The left-hand side of the table shows the transactions of the various superannuationfunds (notional or otherwise) and &quot;pay as yougo&quot; schemes, while the right-hand side show show these transactions enter into public expendi-ture and receipts and contribute to the public sector&apos;s borrowing requirement.4. Emerging superannuation costs are expectedto rise over the period covered by the Report due mainly to:(a) the introduction of improved pension terms as a result of the current review of publicservice pension arrangements;(b) increases in the number of pensions in issue;(c) increases in the average amounts of pensionpayment reflecting past salary and wagemovements.The extra cost will be offset in part by increasedreceipts from employees&apos; contributions. Theextent of the offset cannot be determined at thepresent time as it depends in some measure onthe exercise of options by individual members.

5. The Pensions (Increase) Act 1971 introducedbiennial reviews in order to maintain the pur-chasing power of public service pensions at thelevel at the time of award; the SuperannuationAct 1972 provides that the review period willbecome annual from December 1972. The effectof the 1971 Act, in terms of current prices, wasto increase expenditure by  42 million in 1971-72and by  72 million in 1972-73 for the schemescovered by Table 2. Since the effect is toincrease pensions in line with increases in the retail price index, pensions increase is not a factor which needs to be allowed for in the table whichis constructed on the basis of constant (1972Survey) prices.Manpower6. The numbers of public authority employees,corresponding to the figures for remuneration inTable 1 and with the same coverage, are analysedby broad category in the following table:Manpower employed in the United Kingdom by central Government and local authorities,1970 to 1977TABLE 3 &apos;000 as at 1 April1970        1971        1972        1973        1974        1975       1976      1977actual      actual     estimate   estimate    estimate   estimate   estimate estimateCentral government:Public departments	701	700	695	705	717	722	729	730Armed forces	372	369	368	366	356	349	343	339National Health Service	651	673	695	714	731	747	763	779Other.....	77	86	89	93	92	92	92	94Local authorities	1,680	1,776	1,842	1,931	1,983	2,052	2,126	2,197Total    .	3,481	3,604	3,689	3,809	3,879	3,962	4,053	4,139In the absence of departmental returns for localauthority employees on certain services, mainly in the Roads and Miscellaneous local servicesprogrammes, estimates for these missingcategories have been made by the Treasury.Throughout an adjustment has been made to take account of the proportion of part-time employees.7. The average annual increase of 2-4 per centin total numbers from 1971 to 1976 implied bythe figures in: this table compares well with therate of increase in total remuneration over thecorresponding period given in Table 1. A similarcorrespondence is not, however, apparent in rela-tion to individual programmes and it is con-sidered inadvisable to present a table of manpower numbers analysed by programme untilthe reasons for the discrepancies have been investigated with the departments concerned.Similar doubts apply to a lesser extent to thecomponents distinguished in Table 3 and, forthe reason given in the previous paragraph, thefigures for local authorities must be regarded asparticularly subject to error.8. A large proportion of public authorities&apos;manpower is employed in the social services,defined to cover Education, Health and personal services, Social security, local authority employ-ment services (excluding sheltered workshops)and local authority probation and after-care ser-vices. In 1972 the number employed in these services is estimated at about 1,898,000, a littleover 50 per cent of the total of public authorityemployees. This figure covers only those whoare technically employed in the public sector;but in the social services there are large numbersdoing similar work to those directly employed,many of whom are paid from public funds. Theinclusion of university staff, those in non-public sector education, and doctors and dentists outsidethe hospital service gives a social servicesemployment figure of over 2-1 million for 1972.By 1977 on current plans, this will have risen to just under 2-5 million. In each of the mainservices the growth over the whole of the survey period will be at a slower rate than in the lastv two years. But for the social services as a whole the rate of increase forecast for 1972 to 1973 ismuch the same as that which occurred between1970 and 1972 and in parts of some services, e.g.universities and local personal social services, thegrowth rate forecast for 1972 to 1977 is consider-ably in excess of that experienced in recent years.
9. The type of manpower employed in thesocial services is very different from thatemployed in other sectors of the economy. While,for example, in 1966 8 per cent of total employ -ment was in the health and education sectors 48per cent of those with educational or professional qualifications usually obtained after the age of 18were employed in these sectors. This reflects thevery high proportion of professional and technicaljobs in the social services. On the basis of afollow up to the 1971 Public Expenditure Surveyit is estimated that just over 50 per cent of alljobs in the social services could be so classifiedand that these jobs were expected to expandsomewhat faster than the total. This relativelyfast, expansion applied to all the social services,including those such as local personal social ser-vices where professional and technical staffaccount for less than one quarter of totalemployment.10. About two-thirds of the staff in education,and three-quarters of those in health services werewomen. Just under one-half of the women in educational service and just over a quarter inthe health service worked part-time. Thisincidence of part-time employment compares witha figure of between a quarter and a third forwomen in all other employment and suggests thata substantial proportion of those employed inthe educational service would not be availablefor employment in jobs where school hours andholidays do not prevail.11. The pool of qualified technical and profes-sional manpower is expected to grow at a fasterrate than forecast employment opportunities forwhich qualifications are needed, and so no general shortages should occur in these groups.Difficulties may, however, arise in some parts ofthe country and in certain specialisations. Alarge increase in the requirement for unskilledand ancillary staff will occur in some areas ofthe social services. This could lead to shortages in these categories, particularly in the event ofan increase in the private sector demand for labour, because of the only slight expansion ofthe working population now forecast as a resultof more married women expected to seekemployment.CONFTOENTIAL97
METHODOLOGY1. The conventions and classifications used in the1972 Survey are, with the exceptions explained inthe following paragraphs, the same as were usedin the 1971 Survey report and described inAppendix Part Three to that report.Classification2. A number of classification changes has beenmade since last year&apos;s report. Details of such changes incorporated in the White PaperCmnd. 4829 were given in paragraphs 2 to 6(page 101) of &quot;Notes on methodology&quot; in thatWhite Paper.3. The programme classification in this reportincorporates the following further transfers since cmnd. 4829, reflecting changes in organisationand reassessment of the functions of someelements of expenditure:(a) The rent of  buildings with specialisedfunctions from Common services to the relevant programmes.(b) The Torry Research Station from Trade,industry and employment to Agriculture,fisheries and forestry.(c) The transfer of some COI staff to DTI(from Common services to Trade, industryand employment).(d) The Central Computer Agency fromMiscellaneous services and Trade, industryand employment to Common services.(e) Expenditure on various research establish-ments (of which the Building and road research Stations are the largest) fromSurface transport and Trade, industry andemployment to Miscellaneous local services.(/) Expenditure under the Urban programme on day care centres from Health and personal social services to Law and order.(g) Expenditure on the Customs and Excisecomputer at London Airport fromCommon services to Financial administra-tion.4. Four items are included for the first time inthe Survey coverage:(a) National Insurance Fund payments for vocational training included in Trade,industry and employment.(6) Local authority grants to housing associations for improvements includedin Housing.(c) Expenditure on replacement of furniture in schools, etc. included in Education andlibraries,(d) Advances to the Agricultural MortgageCorporation Ltd. included in miscellaneous-neous services.These items increase public expenditure as presented in this Report by:  million at 1972 Survey prices1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-7724 1     25-4     27-4     29-3     30-6     32 05. In accordance with the definition of chargesgiven in paragraph 21 of Part 1 (page 12) of cmnd. 4829 some further items of revenue,previously treated as taxation receipts, have been identified as charges and are now netted off the relevant expenditure. They are :Trade, industry and employment(a) Companies&apos; House fees(b) Space rentals at trade fairs(c) Premiums for shipbuilding guaranteesFinancial administration(d) Exchequer Office, Scotland, feesMiscellaneous services(e) Companies registration (Scotland) fees.These changes reduce public expenditure by:  million at 1972 Survey prices1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1974-75 1975-76 1976-77-4-1    -4-2    -4-4    -4-7    -4-8   -4-8v 6. The estimates in Cmnd. 4829 have been adjusted to take account of the changes listed inparagraphs 3 to 5 above in order to eliminate theeffect of such changes from the comparisons ofthe White Paper estimates with the figuresderived from the 1972 Survey. As a conse-quence of arrangements agreed earlier thisyear with the clearing banks, the cost of the
refinance of export and shipbuilding credits,formerly provided by the Issue Department of theBank of England, will be borne on the Votes ofthe Export Credit Guarantee Department (from april 1972) and the Department of Trade andIndustry (from about August 1972) respectivelyand form part of public expenditure. In order not to distort comparisons with the figures in cmnd. 4829 this expenditure has not been included in the calculation of percentage increasesquoted in this Report (see paragraph 2 of annex A of the Main Report).Price adjustments7. In the Housing programme the deflation toconstant prices of the cash estimates for subsidies and current grants to persons is now embodied inthe constant price estimates shown for that programme and no longer forms part of the&quot;Adjustment of cash programmes to 1972-73outturn prices &quot;.Selective Employment Tax8. All the expenditure out turns and estimatesgiven in the report are at constant (1972 Survey)market prices, i.e. they embody all indirect taxes,including Selective Employment Tax, paid by public bodies at the rates in force when the returns were submitted by departments to theTreasury at the end of February 1972. The effectof this treatment is to include selective employment Tax payments for each yearcovered by the Survey, although the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer announced in his 1972 budget statement his intention to remove this tax asfrom 1 April 1973. While this treatment is apparent from the Tables covering programmeswith local authority expenditure in the first sectionof Part 2, since Selective Employment Taxpayments by local authorities are separatelyidentified, it applies equally to all such payments by public sector bodies. To depart from thisconvention and to omit Selective employment tax payments from the cost of the programmes towhich they relate for the years after 1972-73would invalidate the constant price basis of theexpenditure estimates and the relevant percentagerates of change. For this purpose selective employment Tax payments are simply an element in prices about the future movement of whichthere happens to be some foreknowledge; but this does not justify departure from the conventionswhich govern the constant price basis whichunderlies all the figures.Relative price effect9. The new method of determining the overseas aid programme on a constant price basis requires the introduction of a new price relativity for exports. This relativity is also applied to certain other elements of overseas expenditure, notably the United Kingdom contributions to theEuropean Communities. The following relativitieshave been used in the calculation of the relative price effect for this report:per cent per annumExportsRetail price indexConsumers&apos; expenditureAverage earningsInvestment-0-76-0 14-0-38+2-50-0-60Analysis of adjustments10.

Table 3 of the Main Report continues theinnovation introduced in Cmnd. 4829 and presented in Table 3.1 of that White Paper in attempting to measure the growth of the public expenditure in terms of its impact on demand.The estimates as presented in constant priceexpenditure terms (either with or without therelative price effect) do not provide such ameasure since different types of expenditure havedifferent effects in the demand they make on national output. This is because much of public expenditure contains an element which returns tothe Government in the form of either direct or indirect taxation, and some of the grants paid to persons will be saved. For both of these reasons the demand for currently produced outputgenerated by public outlays will be less than thetotal of expenditure on the programmes; this applies to programmes measured both in volume(excluding relative price effect) and cost (includingrelative price effect) terms.13. The classification of public expenditure by economic category provides the starting point formeasuring the demand effect of expenditure.This classification enables a distinction to bemade between direct expenditure on goods and services (current expenditure on goods and services, fixed investment and increase in thevalue of stocks) and expenditure in the form ofmoney transferred to other institutions or individuals in the private sector. In the case ofthe former the estimate provides a reasonably good guide to the effect on output; but in the vcase of the latter the addition to effective demand is likely to be significantly less because of savingsand the flow-back to the Government through taxpayments.14. The demand impact is not uniform even within   a   particular   economic   category   ofexpenditure. Expenditure on subsidies, forexample, has a different effect on outputdepending on whether the benefit of the subsidiesis deemed to accrue to consumers or to producers;and the implications for demand of debt interestpaid at home differ from those of debt interestpaid abroad. The translation of the expenditureestimates into demand terms, then, while restingprimarily on the economic classification ofexpenditure, also takes account of theprogramme classification. Within this frameworkthe method consists of estimating the proportionof each category of public expenditure which islikely to flow back in taxes or be retained assavings and assigning to each such category acoefficient which measures the demand on outputof each  100 of expenditure. It is then possible by adding together the projected changes in public expenditure, each adjusted by its appropriatecoefficient, to arrive at a measure of the changein the level of demand associated with a givenchange in public expenditure as a whole.&apos;;&apos; &apos;: &quot;&quot;y &apos;&apos;. -15. Examples of demand coefficients applied tothe expenditure figures are given below:Effect on demand at factor cost of  100 change in public expenditure at constant prices.Estimated/ &quot; demand &quot;coefficient Public expenditure affecting demand directlyPublic consumptionWages and salaries     .      .      .      .      100Other current expenditure on goods and services (cegs).....90Public investmentNew fixed investment .      . .      95Stockbuilding     .      .      .      .      .      95

Wages and salaries count 100 per cent asthey represent a direct use of resources and enterdirectly into the measurement of the gross domestic product. Other purchases of goods and services (current and capital) count slightly lessthan 100 per cent because of the indirect taxelement. Grants and net lending abroad byconvention score 100 since within a policy to preserve equilibrium in the balance of paymentsany addition to expenditure abroad must be matched by at least an equivalent increase in theoutput of goods and services for export or forimport substitution^ Different subsidies are associated with different demand coefficients;those which affect only the incomes of producers and are not passed on in price reductions willhave a lower coefficient than those which add tothe real income of consumers. In the case of current grants to persons, the transition fromexpenditure figures to the effect on demandinvolves deductions to cover increased payments of income tax and net indirect taxes and additions to savings. The total amount deducted will vary according to the kind of current grant involved;for example, a smaller proportional deduction forsaving is made for retirement pensions than forstudent grants, because pensioners are on averagepoorer than students&apos; parents. Current grants to private bodies have a higher demand coefficientthan grants to persons since they are assumed tobe spent wholly on goods and services by the relevant bodies.17. In the present state of knowledge the calculation of demand effects is neccessarilyimprecise and involves the application of judgment. Reasonably precise average estimatescan in fact be made of the demand effects of* It is likely that more than 100 of resources will have tobe diverted from domestic use in order to maintain thebalance of payments since there may be additional costsinvolved in switching resources to the balance of payments e.g. the terms of trade may have to worsen. However, thecircumstances in which such expenditures are made are toovaried to allow a single average figure to be put on such additional costs, and expenditures abroad are thusconventionally scored at 100.expenditure on goods and services and of the major current grants to the personal sector.Certain kinds of transfers may, however, affectsaving rather than spending in the short run andit may take some time for changes in such pay-ments by the public sector to work through to demand. Some categories for instance,subsidies involve considerable problems ofestimation. Furthermore, the demand effects ofcertain types of expenditure may depend criticallyon the circumstances in which the expendituresare made. For example, the effect of a changein lending to the private sector will depend on thefinancial situation. The relative scarcity of resources in various parts of the country is alsorelevant. Additional expenditure which utilisesresources which would otherwise have beenunemployed adds to output as well as to demand and does not therefore require anoffsetting cut in expenditure either elsewhere inthe public sector or by other parts of. the economy. Situations of this kind require a gooddeal of educated guesswork, and to this extentsingle average figures may be misleading. the assumptions underlying the figures in Table 3 take no account of such variations.18. Last year&apos;s Survey Report contained a tableanalysing expenditure by resource category,distinguishing net expenditure on resources, trans-fers, etc., and net purchases of existing assets.This form of analysis, which was first presented in the Green Paper of April 1969 &quot;public expenditure: a new presentation &quot; (Cmnd. 4017)represented a first attempt to express the growth of public expenditure programmes in terms oftheir demand on output. It suffers from theserious defect that each of the three categories ofresource use distinguished in the analysis covers a wide range of different types of expenditurewith different implications for resource use. Thispresentation does not, therefore, summarise in asuccinct form the rate of change implied by theexpenditure included in each of the resource usecategories, still less by the totality of expenditure.The presentation in Table 3 has the great advan-tage that it provides a single measure of thechange in the demand on resources implied bythe projections of public expenditure as a whole,with corresponding measures relating to the major economic categories of expenditure.19. This form of analysis has not yet reachedthe degree of sophistication which will permit ofits extension to measure the demand effects of changes in expenditure on individual programmes.It is, however, possible to make use of theprinciples underlying this methodology to formsome broad assessment of the degree to which thedifferent programmes make demands on thenation&apos;s output.
20. Expenditure on those programmes whichgoes largely on current expenditure on goods and services and new fixed investment must havea demand coefficient approaching 100 and thusincrease the pressure of demand almost   for  ;the Defence Budget, Nationalised industries,Roads, Health and personal social services,Common services and Miscellaneous services fall into this category. The Overseas aid and e.c. andother overseas services programmes, with theirhigh content of expenditure abroad, have a similarimpact. Expenditure on programmes such asSocial security and to a lesser extent Agriculture,fisheries and forestry and Trade, industry andemployment, which contain a large element of grants to the private sector, increases the pressure of demand rather less than   for  . Other pro-grammes (Research Councils, etc., Surface trans-port and Housing) consist of expenditure on goods and services and transfers in more or less equalproportions, and this balance of expenditure willbe reflected in their impact on demand.
