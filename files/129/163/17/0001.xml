DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(72) 67 COPY NO      6526 June 1972CABINETSELECT COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURES REPORT on matters SUB JUDICEMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. The principal recommendations made by the Procedure Committeeare summarised in Annex I to this memorandum,2*        The report was discussed at Cabinet last Thursday(CM(72) 31st Conclusions, Minute 2) and I was then invited, in consultationwith the Attorney General, to prepare a memorandum setting out the issuesfor consideration.    The Lord Chancellor will be reporting the results ofhis discussions with the judiciary.3.        As agreed at Cabinet, I informed the House of Commons later that day, in the course of exchanges with the Leader of the Opposition following the Business Statement, that the Government was considering this report with the greatest urgency, and that a definitive statement would be madeas soon as possible.POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION4.        There would seem to be three possible courses:i. To reject the Committee^ recommendations, and to leavethe existing sub judice rule as it stands. (The relevant House ofCommons resolution is reproduced at Annex 2).ii. To accept the Committee&apos;s proposals in full.    This wouldmean relaxing the sub judice rule in relation to proceedings (otherthan for defamation) in civil courts generally, including proceedings before the Industrial Relations Court, subject always to thesafeguard that the Chair would exercise its discretion to prevent any &quot;real and substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings&quot;.1
iii.       To accept the Committee^ proposals in relation to proceedings before the Industrial Relations Court, but to reject(or possibly defer for further consideration) any relaxation of thepresent sub judice rule with regard to proceedings in other civil courts.i. REJECTION OF THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDATIONS5.        In considering this course we must recognise that these are the unanimous recommendations of an all-Party committee.    It would certainly be very strongly argued in the House that the increasing involvement ofMinisters as parties to court proceedings on matters in the financial,economic and planning fields, and in particular in relation to proceedings before the Industrial Relations Court, required an urgent reconsideration ofthe existing convention, and that its retention in its present form seriouslyinhibited the House in one of its main functions, that of debating matters of current national importance.6,        It would seem difficult to refute this, particularly if we seek tomaintain, for example, that Ministers are not accountable to Parliamenteven on issues on which they cannot be &quot;assailed&quot; in the Inc.astrial RelationsCourt, or if the effect is to prevent the discussion in Parliament of mattersof wide public concern which are already the subject of general public discussion and Press comment.7,        The present rule in practice does not prevent Members who are determined to find means of doing so from making comments about matters before the courts under the guise, for example, of points of order, and frequently it is only the refutation of such remarks which the Speaker isable to prevent.ii. ACCEPTANCE OF COMMITTEES RECOMMENDATIONS IN FULL8,        The principal issue here appears to be whether the proposed degreeof discretion on the part of the Chair to refuse questions and preventdebate on matters before the civil courts where there is &quot;a real and substantial danger of prejudice to the proceedings&quot;, and the ultimateMinisterial right to refuse an answer, are sufficient safeguards againstthe risk that the proposed relaxation of the sub judice rule might affectthe integrity of the judicial procedure.    The extent and possible effect ofany such risk would, however, need to be weighed against the countervailingconsideration that Parliament should not be inhibited from discussingmatters of national importance unless there are overriding reasons.    the speaker made clear his own view on the matter in the House on 15 June(col. 1754) when he said that ir. criminal cases or in a particular kind ofcivil case the burden of proof should be on those who wished to relax thesub judice rule, but that in other types of civil case and wider matters ofindustrial and political policy the burden of proof should be upon those who wished to assert the rule.2
9. The Lord Chancellor, following his discussions with the judiciarywill no doubt say what risks there might be of questions etc in Parliamentaffecting the judicial procedure.    Such risks would, however, seem likelyto be less in higher courts; particularly in the Industrial Relations Courtitself, because of the relative experience of the parties and witnessesconcerned, the expedition of its proceedings, and the general public debatealready occurring as background to any Ministerial application,10.        The Procedure Committee do not recommend, subject to the ChairTsoverriding discretion, that the sub judice rule should be relaxed as regardsthe discussion of the &quot;precise issues&quot; before a court to which a minister has made an application or in which he has initiated proceedings.    whilst the Committee have, at Mr Speaker&apos;s specific request, laid down guidelinesfor the exercise of the Chair&apos;s discretion, a considerable burden will inevitably be placed on the Chair in interpreting the guidelines in particular cases.    The Speaker would not, however, be required to state reasonsfor his decisions.11,        The Procedure Committee specifically referred in their report tothe risk, pointed out to them in evidence by the Attorney General, thatcomment in Parliament might prejudice the position of witnesses andparties before the court.    In commending the Committee&apos;s recommendation to the House I would emphasise the importance we attach to the exercise ofthe Speakers discretion to prevent the improper influencing of witnessesand of parties in the proceedings before the court.iii,       ACCEPTANCE OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN RELATION TO THEINDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COURT ONLY12.       Whilst, for the reasons outlined in paragraph 9, the risk ofprejudicing proceedings seems likely to be less in the case of the industrial relations Court than in other civil courts, any singling out of the industrial relations Court in relation to this report would be seen as an acknowledgement by the Government that this court is outside normal judicial processes and is in some special way a &quot;political&quot; court.    It would thus tend to undermine its authority.LAW OF CONTEMPT13,       With regard to the discussion of measuresxtaken by the industrial relations Court to enforce its rulings, it is suggested that no distinctioncan or should be drawn between this and other courts.    The PhillimoreCommittee is currently examining the law of contempt as a whole:  theIndustrial Relations Court is within its terms of reference.   It would not,however, be appropriate for that Committee to consider the question ofdiscussion in Parliament.3
CRITICISM OF JUDGES14.        The Procedure Committee^ report would not affect the presentrule that a judge can be criticised only by means of a substantive Motion.R CPrivy Council Office26 June 19724

Questions-should not be such as might prejudice the case under trial.This rule does not apply to Bills.      (The relevant resolution is set out in Annex 2.)Committee&apos;s ma,in recommendations(a) Proceedings in criminal courts, courts martial,tribunals of inquiry and proceedings in civil courts for defamation - no change.(b) Proceedings in civil courts (other than defamationcases) - may in future be referred t o in the House(motions, questions, debate) unless it appears tothe Chair that &quot;there is a real and substantialdanger of prejudice to the proceedings&quot;.The Committee cite, as an example, that an application by a private person or body for the appointment of areceiver in relation to the affairs of another privateperson might be prejudiced by comment in parliament on the financial position of either party to the case;similarly, that a dispute as to ownership of or rights over land or premises might equally be prejudiced byquestions or debate in the House.
(c) In applying (b) to proceedings before the industrial relations Court, the Committee recommend that, subjectto the discretion of the Chair, which should beexercised with due regard to the considerations setout in their report, there should normally be no barto motions, questions or debate on &quot;unassailable&quot;Ministerial views expressed t o the Court underparagraphs (l)(a) and (c) of Sections 138 and 141 of theIndus tria.1 Relations Act, being views which could onlybe challenged in the Court on grounds of bad faith, etc&quot;or to the discussion of considerations of the national economy, national security and public disorder and of danger to persons or livelihoods set out in subsection(2) of Sections 138 and 141.(d) With regard, however, to issues under subsection (2)of Sections 139 and 142 of the Industrial relations act (eg the specification of the areas of employment to be covered and the individuals to be bound by&quot;cooling off&quot; orders, the length of the &quot;cooling off&quot;period, and the form of the question on which a ballot is to be taken), the Speaker in exercising his discretion should be influenced in particular by&quot;the improprietjr of questions, motions or debate onthe precise details which the Court must specify inany such orders&quot;.
