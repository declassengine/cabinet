IHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 60 COPY NO       g 14 June 1972CABINETNORTHERN IRELAND:  LOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM ANDPROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Northern ireland. I am seeking the agreement of my colleagues to the introductionof Proportional Representation (PR) for the local government elections in Northern Ireland this autumn.    In April, shortly after we assumeddirect responsibility for Northern Ireland administration, I announcedthat effect would be given to the programme of local government reforminaugurated by the previous Northern Ireland Government.    this involves the performance by central agencies of many of the mostimportant functions hitherto carried out by local authorities, such aseducation, health and welfare services and housing;  and the creationof a smaller single tier of district councils to administer the remainingfunctions.    It was envisaged that the elections to these councils wouldbe held in October 1972.    A large programme of legislation (by Orderin Council subject to affirmative resolution under the present law) is involved in bringing the new system into full operation on 1 April 1973,the date contemplated when the programme was drawn up.    details are given in Annex A.2.        Strong pressure has now built up to introduce PR for the local elections.    The Northern Ireland Liberal Party, the Northern IrelandLabour Party, the Alliance Party and the Social Democratic and LabourParty all press for the local elections to be conducted on PR by meansof the single transferable vote (STV).    It was strongly advocated at thefirst meeting, held under my chairmanship on 6 June, of the NorthernIreland Commission and there was no dissent/   PR was also pressed byOpposition Members in the debate on 12 June and it is clear that theOpposition are firmly committed to PR for the coming local governmentelection: to an extent indeed that there is every indication that if it is notintroduced they are likely to obstruct the whole of our legislative programme for Northern Ireland.3.        It may be that PR will not in itself succeed in breaking thepolitical polarity, but there can be little doubt that it is one of the mostpotent instruments in attempting to do that.    It was the system stipulatedin the interests of the minority in the 1920 Settlement for bothParliamentary and local elections.    I have reached the conclusion not1
SECRETonly that there is a strong case for PR oil its own merits, but also thatit is going to be extremely hard to defend a position not to introduce PRif we are to maintain the goodwill of those who can make a substantial contribution to the success of our initiative.4. The different systems of PR are described in Annex B and themost suitable of them is STV.    STV requires multi-member constituencies and the local government Boundaries Commission have justcompleted their work of drawing up the boundaries of the 26 new district councils and of single-member wards within those boundaries.    In order,therefore, that PR may be introduced for the autumn election, it will benecessary to group the existing wards in such a way as to create largerelectoral areas each returning, say, 4 members;  and to do so in such away as to secure the confidence of the electorate that the electoraldivisions are fair.    The legislative measures involved are described in Annex C on the assumption that they will take the form of Orders inCouncil rather than Bills.    To give time to set up the new electoralareas and introduce PR as the method of election, the necessary Orderin Council must take effect at latest by the end of July (and therefore belaid before the end of June) and the election will probably have to be postponed to November/December 1972 - this would still allow time forthe new councils to prepare themselves for the start of the new system on1 April 1973.    The introduction of PR is within the powers of theNorthern Ireland Parliament under the Government of Ireland Act 1920and legislation by Order in Council, subject to affirmative resolution,is therefore proper.    A Bill is not only unnecessary; it would alsoraise the question whether PR for local elections should be madeirrepealable by any future Northern Ireland legislature - a sensitiveone in the present interregnum; and it seems impossible that a bill could be passed so as to take effect before the end of July.    To legislate for PR by Bill would put the whole programme in jeopardy.5. The attitude of the Opposition is such that if we decide not tointroduce PR we have to choose between forcing through against strong opposition a local government programme whose size (as indicated in annex A) makes it extremely vulnerable and abandoning the localgovernment reform programme altogether during our year of direct rule.A short postponement and a broken financial year could not becontemplated.    To abandon the programme would have several serious effects: we should be abandoning a reform which we have supported; itwould be demonstrated that we were incapable under direct rule of doingthat which Stormont was in process of doing; and major administrativeconfusion and inefficiency would result.    All that could be said on theother side would be that we had decided not to prejudice, by new localgovernment arrangements, the final political settlement; but it would lookas if we were running away from PR, and from local government reform.6.        If my colleagues agree to the introduction of PR, I would proposeto announce on Thursday 15 June, at the same time as I hope to announce the initiation of talks preparatory to a round table conference, that thelocal government elections this autumn will be held on PR.W W2Northern Ireland Office13 June 1972
Annex ALOCAL GOVERNMENT REFORM programme the programme is based on the Macrory Report of 1970 and whoserecommendations were to vest in the Central Government ultimate responsibility for a number of important services hitherto dischargedwholly or in substantial part by local government bodies.   Thesecentralised services were to be managed in one of two ways.   Planning,roads and water f.n&amp; sewerage were to become the direct responsibility ofthe Ministry of Development (the decision had already been taken ultimately to vest powers of house-building and management throughout NorthernIreland in a Housing Executive, part nominated and part representativeof local government interests).   Education and libraries and Health and personal Social Services were to be managed by a number of Area Boards,the majority of whose members would be appointed by the appropriate minister to represent relevant interests while the balance would be nominated by the new District Councils.   The functions remaining tolocal government, all of a local environmental character, were to be discharged by a new pattern of 26 District Councils which would replaceall existing local authorities.   Consequential upon these radical changes,new financial arrangements for the relevant services were to be worked out,including the central collection of rates in respect both of districtServices and of the hitherto local services transferred to central management.2.   Measures have already been passed to set up the Northern IrelandHousing Executive which is now in full operation, and to provide5in theLocal Government Act (NI) 1972, for the future structure of the Diart*rd*p$Councils-.   The measures that remain to be passed are those dealing withspecific services as follows a.   Measures for which affirmative resolutioas will be required beforethe summer recess.* Education* Health and Personal Social ServicesElectricity SupplyRatingPlanningWater and SewerageThe last 3 of these measures could, at some cost, be placed under b. below.1

Measures to be in force by early January 1973-MuseumsBirths, Deaths and MarriagesRoad TrafficDrainageYouth Welfare and Recreation*These are substantial measures running to iver100 clauses.3.   In addition there is the Electoral Law Order, which is to govern the conduct of the Local Government Elections and is dealtwith in Annex C.
Annex BSYSTEMS OF PRTYPES OF SYSTEMThere are broadly 2 systems of PR:-a. The List System, under which the electors vote for partiesrather than individuals and the seats are distributed amongthe parties in proportion to the number of votes each partyreceives.b. The Single Transferable Vote (STV), under which the electornumbers in order of preference as many of the candidates as he wishes with the result that those finally elected representproportionately the preferences of the electorate.   The system is described more fully below.PLURALITY OF MEMBERS2.     Since clearly no one person can represent the electors of an area in proportion to their preferences, it follows that all systems of PRrequire multi-member electoral areas.   In this respect PR can be distinguished from the Alternative Vote, which is simply a method of securing that thewinning candidate in a single member area is elected on an absolute majority,,by asking each elector to indicate how he would vote if his favouritecandidate were defeated on a count of first preferences.   Under the Listsystem it is possible to have larger electoral areas than under STV, andthe electoral area could consist either of the whole local governmentdistrict without division into wards or of large multi-member wardswithin the district.   But STV would become unmanageable in practice if eachelector were asked to express his preference among candidates for as many as 15 to 30 seat3 on a district council.   For STV therefore it is desirableto have wards returning 3-5 members, and a suitable standard number wouldbe 4.THE LIST SYSTE1 AND STV COMPARED3.     The List system tends on the whole to the dominance of parties.;   STVis the system formerly used in Northern Ireland, and used in the irish republic now, and that mainly advocated by the proponents of PR.   Theadvantages of STV have been well stated as follows: -a. The elected body reflects xzithin limits of a few per cent thestrength of political parties or other groups of opinion amongthe electors.b. Any party or other group having a majority of votes will have amajority of seats.-1-
c. The element of the gamble is eliminated.d. The elector is enabled to choose between candidates on personalas well as party grounds and his choice overrides that of any party organisation.THE MECHANICS OF STV4.     Each elector has one vote only, but is asked to indicate his 1st,2nd,5rd or any number of preferences he pleases against the names of the candidates on the ballot paper.   At the count the quota of votes necessaryto secure election is determined by dividing the number of ballot paperscast by one more than the number of vacancies, and adding one to theresult.   Any candidate who secures the quota on a count of his 1st preferencesis declared elected.   If any candidate is thus elected, the next step is toredistribute among the others his surplus votes (the number of votes bywhich the first preference votes cast for him exceeds the quota) by referenceto the 2nd preferences indicated on those votes.   This may result in anothercandidate or candidates securing the quota: in which case, if there is stilla vacancy, his or their surplus votes are redistributed according to the3rd preference.   If no candidate secures the quota, the 2nd preferencevotes of the candidate with the least number of 1st preference votes areredistributed, and the process continues until all the vacancies are filled by candidates who have secured the quota.5. The mechanics of PR are complex, but their complexity affects theorganisation of the count rather than the choice facing the individualelector.BY-ELECTIONS6.     On the occurrence of a casual vacancy, there is a choice between not having a by-election, on the footing that members remain to represent the constituency (although the political balance on the council might beupset) and conducting a by-election by the ordinary process of a relativemajority (each members elected for a ward being allotted to a sub-wardfor  the purpose).
Annex CLEGISLATIVE MEASURES FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF PRLegislation will have to deal with the following 2 groups of matters:-a. The establishment of PR and related matters.b. The general law for the conduct of the election, registers,nomination, expenses and so forth.2.   The programme that is envisaged, subject to modifications that further consideration may suggest, is as follows.   There would bean Order in Council dealing with the establishment of PR.   This wouldprovide that Northern Ireland was to be divided into 26 districtsalready recommended by the Local Government Boundaries Commissionerunder the Local Government Boundaries Act (Northern Ireland) 1971;and that the number of members to be returned for each district wasto correspond with the number of single-member wards alreadyrecommended for that district.   It would provide for a commissionerwho might be the Chief Electoral Officer, contemplated in the electoral law Order (see below) to make recommendations as to the multi-memberwards required for PR:   he would be required to recommend PR wardscomprising 3*^ or 5 of the recommended single-member wards (thislatitude is required since the number of members of each districtcouncil will not necessarily be divisible by any one figure, and therewill have to be some marginal wards returning a smaller or greater number of members than the standard).   The commissioner might berequired to publish provisional recommendations, to invite observations on them and to make his final recommendations.   The final recommenda-tions would be embodied in a subordinate instrument giving effect tothe Secretary of State&apos;s decision on them.   There would not, however,be likely to be time for this Order to be subject to any parliamentary procedure.3.   The Order would go on to provide that at any contested election of members of a district council the election shall be according tothe principle of proportional representation, each elector having onetransferable vote, that is to say, a vote -a. capable of being given so as to indicate the voter&apos;spreference for the candidates in orde&quot;r;   and b. capable of being transferred to the next choice when the vote is not required to give a prior choice the necessaryquota of votes, or when, owing to the &quot;deficiency in thenumber of votes given for a prior choice, that choice iseliminated from the list of candidates.
It would provide that the mechanics of PR would be dealt within a subordinate instrument, which would be subject to negative resolution at Westminster.5. Matters such as the compilation of registers, nominationand candidates&apos; sxpenses and so forth would be dealt with ina separate Electoral Law Order.
