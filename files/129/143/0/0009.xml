6/7lCABINETNATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE CHARGESNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer for the reasons given in his paper (C(69) 83) the Secretary ofState for Social Services proposes to say in next Monday^ debate on thePrayer against the increases in the charges for teeth and spectaclesthat it is the Governments intention to abolish prescription chargeswhen the economic difficulties v/hich compelled their introduction havebeen overcome.2.      As the Secretary of State points out, there has never been anystrong dislike of prescription charges among the public generally.    Ifwe now give a pledge to abolish charges we shall reopen the whole issue,and involve ourselves in a running fight during which we shall constantlybe asked whether the economic situation has recovered sufficiently forthe pledge to be redeemed.    This could be especially damaging duringthe election campaign.    Either we shall have to give a definite pledgeon prescription charges (which may well be damagingly exploited bythe Conservatives) or we shall be unable to claim, if as we hope this is justified, that there has been substantial economic improvement.And in any event when economic recovery has been achieved, we shall find we have pre-empted resources in this particular way and that otheraims which may well be even more desirable have to go by the board.3.      It v/ould in my view therefore be undesirable and unnecessary toenter into a commitment of this sort in Mondayrs debate.    The advantageof marginally increasing the Governments majority against the Prayerwould be substantially outweighed by the subsequent embarrassment to usbetween now and the election, during the election campaign, and possiblyafterwards.    If the Secretary of State feels it is really essential to mentionprescription charges in the debate on teeth and spectacle charges and toput the two types of charge in relation to each other, he could say that theGovernment consider that, if we were in a position in which v/e could contemplate forgoing any of the Health Service charges, it would be preferable to give priority to the abolition of prescription charges ratherthan to the abolition of charges on teeth and spectacles.R.H, J.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.15 th July, 1969C(69) 8415th July. 1969DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)
