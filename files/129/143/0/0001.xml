m   secret(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 76 COPY NO.7th July, 1969CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:   LAW AND ORDER PR PGR AI/II /IEMemorandum by the Lord chancellor in the Report on Public Expenditure to 1973-74 the expenditureon matters for which I am responsible (apart from those falling underthe heading of Miscellaneous Services) is grouped under the generalheading of Law and Order with a number of other items involving muchgreater expenditure, some of which appear to have no relation to law andorder at all.    The result of this treatment is that any reduction in thetotal expenditure on la-w and order is bound to have a disproportionateeffect on the administration of the departments for which I am responsibleand to leave me with quite inadequate resources for the objectives I amseeking to achieve.    Yet I believe these objectives to be as important,perhaps more important in Party terms, than many mcore espeasiveprojects,2.       The Votes for which I am responsible within the law and orderblock and their estimated net and gross cost in the current financialyear are as follows -Vote                                           Net Cost Gross Cost   Supreme Court                                        799,000 4,477,000County Court                                           552,000 7,952,000Legal Aid Fund 8,171,000 8,171,000Total 9, 522,000 20,600,0003,      It will be observed that less than half of the total cost requires tobe found from taxation.    This is because the user of the services provided by my departments meets the cost in large measure fromthe fees he is required to pay.    The only Vote whose gross cost isnot reduced in this way is the legal aid fund, which provides a social service,
4.      Allied services ought naturally to be taken into account, especially as the judges are paid out of the Consolidation Fund.    This additional expenditure will amount to  5,448,000 this year, bringing the net totalto  14,970,000 and the gross total to  26,040,000.5.       The three Votes mentioned in paragraph 2 comprise 3. 5 per cent of the law and order total this year.    They will increase by 8 per cent overthe next five years while the law and oi&apos;der total increases by 26 per cent.The estimated increase in the legal aid Vote is due solely to the natural growth of the existing service and to the effect of changes in the generallaw, such as those which are consequential on the Divorce Reform Dill.Notliing is provided for the extension of the legal aid and advice schemes,which are now utterly out of date, or, in the other Votes, to meet theproposals of the Beeching Commission whose Report is expected shortly.As matters stand at present, any further money for legal aid must comefrom savings in other branches of the law and order programme which ai4enot under my control and the cost of which, as I have shown, in rising over three times as rapidly as that of the services for which I am responsible,6,       I have said that the Vote for the legal aid fund represents the costof a social service.    Just aa it is vital that people of limited moans shouldbe given the financial assistance they need to enable vhora to maintain adecent standard of living, so wo should do all we can to make it possiblefor them to enforce their legal rights.    This will in many instances enablethem to avoid recourse to the social services.    The civil legal aid schemecosts less than one-thousandth of the cost of tho other social services.    Ithas risen 22 per cent under our socialist Government while sociai. securityexpenditure has increased by 63 per cent.    Legal aid expenditure isestimated to rise by 8 per cent by 1973-74 while social security exponditu.rowill rise by 19 per cent.7.       Having no large net amounts among tho Votes under my control, i cannot be selective, robbing Peter to pay Paul as some of my colleaguescan, thus ensuring that the funds at their disposal are used to implement the most urgent of their policies.    My meagre sums have to be spent onmeeting the day-to-day costs of current services with nothing loft over for development of new policies.8.       Yet new policies are of vital importance: in the legal aid field,for extending legal advice, improving the financial conditions of legal aid (which have stood unchanged since I960) and extending it to tribunals;and, in the Supreme Court, for putting the organisation of our courts ona modern footing in accordance with the recommendations to be expected from the Decching Commission.9.       So far as legal aid is concerned, my Advisory Committee havo&apos;   already recommended an improvement in the financial conditions forlegal aid at a cost of  0. 2 million arid the extension of legal aid to thoLands Tribunal at a coat of  00I5 million.    I expect the Committeeshortly to recommend an improved legal advice scheme, which is urgently needed, at a cost of  1, 5 million rising in four years to  2. 3 million,,
10,       The Beeching Commission is likely to make recommendationsaffecting the administration of justices at Assizes and Quarter Sessionswhich will result in the transfer to central funds of the costs at presentborne by local funds and which will give us for the first time an effectivecentrally organised system of justice much cheaper in terms of socialcost than the present wasteful and diffuse system dating back to theMiddle Ages,    While I am unable at present to provide any detailed estimates of the cost of the Beeching proposals, they are unlikely to exceed  50, 000 in the first year of the programmed implementation,representing the initial cost of providing a central court service,11.       If a start: were made in putting these measures into effect nextyear they would increase the cost of law and order by 0, 3 per cent in1970-71,    For the reasons I have given earlier in this memorandum,I hope my colleagues will agree that special account should be taken of my needs in considering any proposals for the saving of expenditure under the general heading of Law and Order,G.House of Lords, S.V/.1,7th July, 1969
