DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYr3 GOVERNMENT)C(69) 8516th July, 1969COPY NO.CABINETEXTENSION OF THE OMBUDSMAN PRINCIPLENote by the Prime minister am circulating for the Cabinefs consideration a report by acommittee of officials under the chairmanship of the Head of the CivilService, to which is attached a draft of the lines on which a parliamentary statement might be made.H.W.10 Downing Street, S.W.1.16th July, 1969
EXTENSION OF THE OMBUDSMAN PRINCIPLEReport by officials in answer to Parliamentary Questions on 24th June the PrimeMinister said (Columns 1209-1210) he hoped to make a statement in thevery near future on the Ombudsman system and local government, andthat he hoped to make a statement before the Summer Recess on theNational Health Service, special inspection and a specialist Ombudsmanfor that field.2.      So far as local government is concerned, the Prime Ministersanswer followed correspondence between him and the Minister of housing and Local Government, who had proposed that he should discuss with hiscolleagues the extension of the Ombudsman system to local government,with a view to an announcement that the Government favoured this extension in principle and proposed to apply it to the new structure oflocal government by legislation in the Bill on local government reorganisation.3.      The question of a possible Ombudsman or grievance commissionerfor the National Health Service was raised in the First Green Paper on national Health Service Organisation and is now under consideration bythe Secretary of State for Social Services.    The Secretary of Statereferred to this in a Parliamentary answer on 19th May v/hen he said thathe was himself convinced that there was a substantial case for a publichealth commissioner, while making it clear that he first wished toestablish a hospital advisory service under its director.4.      A draft has been prepared, and is annexed to this note, of a parliamentary statement which might be made before the summer recess if Ministers so decided.    That part of the Statement which refers to local government has the approval of the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment: the paragraph relating to the Health Service has beenapproved by the Secretary of State for Social Services,5,      In reaching a decision about the Statement, and about its terms,Ministers may wish to take account of the matters covered in the rest ofthis note.Northern Ireland6.      The Northern Ireland Government have announced their intentionto establish an Ombudsman system for investigating complaints ofmaladministration in Northern Ireland local authorities and other public bodies.    This announcement was the starting point of the parliamentary question by Mr. Ben Whitaker, MP, which the Prime Minister answeredon 24th June.    It is by no means certain what form the Northern Ireland-1-
legislation will take, but an official Working Party has suggested thatthis &quot;Commissioner for Complaints&quot; should cover not only localauthorities and new towns, but also the Northern Ireland Arts Council,Industrial Training Boards, the Museums, Youth Employment Serviceand the Livestock Marketing Commission.    It is suggested that boththe police and the health service bodies should be included, but that action taken in the exercise of the powers of a constable, and diagnosisand medical care by dentists, doctors, chemists, nurses, etc., wouldbe excluded, as would police disciplinary proceedings.    The effect wouldprobably be that the area of police and health service activity admitted to the Commissioner for Complaints would be fairly limited.Appointments and other personnel matters for the whole range of bodiescovered would be within the scope, and access to the commissioner would be direct, but there would be a time bar of two months and a 5 fee, returnable if the grounds for the complaint were reasonable.Linked with the plan for a Commissioner for Complaints is a schemefor a Community Relations Council, modelled on our Race relations board, but intended to deal with religious discrimination.7.      If the Northern Ireland proposals emerge in this form, theycould be used as a basis for argument that the Ombudsman system hereshould be extended not only to local government and the health servicebut also to the police and to autonomous public bodies.    But the PrimeMinister has already said that English local government is different from Northern Ireland local government and Ministers may wish to takevery firmly the line that whatever decisions they make here aremodelled on circumstances in Great Britain and not copied from northern Ireland,    The problem of religious discrimination and the weakness of Northern Ireland local government, as well as the smallnessof scale, creates a quite different situation.    For example, all sorts of personnel matters must be included in Northern Ireland, because of therisk of religious discrimination.    The case for inclusion or exclusionwould not turn on that consideration in Great Britain.    The exclusion inNorthern Ireland of action taken in the exercise of the powers of aconstable, and of all kinds of professional activity in the health service,may however be significant.&quot;Administrative Action&quot; in area outside central government,      It is in matters of professional activity that most of the difficulties about extending the Ombudsman system to local government and the health service would probably arise.    It must be expected that bodiesrepresenting professional staff of one kind or another will resist strongly the intervention of an Ombudsman in their field of professional judgmentand activity.    There has already been a suggestion in the British MedicalJournal that an Ombudsman for the health service might be bitterlyresented and looked upon as a busybody.    During the passage of theParliamentary Commissioner Bill the difficulty about applying theParliamentary Commissioner principle to areas of clinical judgment was explained in Parliament by Ministers,    The Secretary of State for social services has already undertaken to consult the medical profession fullybefore deciding to introduce a health service commissioner.-2-
9.      Similar difficulties may be expected in relation to teachers.For example, there may be no very logical line of distinction betweenadministrative acts of local education authorities or school governors and administrative acts of headmasters.    But while it may be possible and inevitable to include within an Ombudsman^ scope maladministrationby a local education authority, it must be expected that the NationalUnion of Teachers would resist intervention in the work of a headmaster.It might be argued that the maintenance of school discipline should beregarded as part of administration because it was not part of teaching,but there would be the greatest practical difficulty about including itin an Ombudsman^ field.Police10.      It will be expected that the extension of the Ombudsman system to local government would also bring in police authorities.    Here again,it would be necessary, and difficult, to distinguish administrative actionfrom the operational activities of the police.    And, as in other cases,a good deal of the credit from the extension could be lost if it were necessary to exclude most of the area which those particularly interestedwished to see included.Commercial and contractual activities11.       The commercial and contractual activities of the centralGovernment are at present excluded from the field of the Pax-liarnentaryCommissioner.    This is on the ground that these are not part of the relationship between government and the governed, and that there isno reason why the State as contracting party or purchaser should beplaced in a worse position than any private citizen or undertaking.On this principle the commercial and contractual transactions of localgovernment would also be excluded;  this would rule out, for example,complaints about local authority bus fares and house rents.Autonomous public bodies12,      An ombudsman system for local government, and perhaps forthe autonomous health service bodies, is bound to raise the question of extension to other public bodies.    It is assumed that Ministers would not wish to apply to the business of the nationalised industries a handicapwhich their private competitors would not suffer by applying anOmbudsman system to them.    They have of course statutory consultativeor consumer councils intended to examine and resolve grievances already,and to go further would seem to reduce the independence in day to day management which Parliament intended them to have.    Nevertheless,there will be those who will argue that nationalised industries should betreated the same as local government in this respect;  and if commercial and contractual activities of local government are included, thearguments for excluding nationalised industries will be weakened.
There are also bodies like the Arts Council, the new towns, the research Councils, etc., some examples of which may be included inthe field of the Northern Ireland Complaints Commissioner.Extension to them would raise difficulties both of definition and of enforcement.    There would be quite acute difficulties of definition about what was and what was not a public body.    For example, there are some bodies (e.g. schools) where the governors appointed by a localauthority are in a minority.    It is not clear whether they should beincluded in the local government field.    As to enforcement, it wouldnot be possible in the case of local authorities or of autonomous public bodies to rely on the influence of Parliament.    This might mean a power of intervention of Ministers, at any rate in the case of theautonomous bodies, which could affect -&quot;-ery detailed aspects of theirope rations./Filter&quot; for complaints13.       Ministers may want to leave open for the present the questionwhether complaints against local authorities would have to be channelledthrough local councillors.    Councillors in committee are themselvesresponsible for the services being administered, unlike Members ofParliament, and there is a greater possibility of single party dominationin local government.    These make councillors less suitable thanMembers of Parliament as a filter&quot;.    The anewer might be to usecouncillors of the proposed Redcliffe-Maud ?lowest tier&quot; community councils.    No &quot;filter&quot; in local government would make it more difficultto defend the retention of the filter through MPrs in central Government.There seems no possibility of a &quot;filter&quot; in the Health Service or withother autonomous bodies.Cost14,      At a very rough estimate the cost of a system of provincial orregional Ombudsmen in local government might be about  2 million ayear at present prices.    K the system were extended to the health service or other areas, there would be additional costs.-4-
ANNEZExtension of the Ombudsman PrincipleDraft Parliamentary StatementWe now have more than two years&apos; experience of the working ofthe Parliamentary Commissioner system in central government,    Ibelieve that it is helping towards making administration more humanand more acceptable.    I would like to inform the House that theGovernment now feel able to announce their intention to legislate in due course for the extension of the ombudsman service to certain other areas of the national life outside central government.First, the Government accept in principle that an ombudsmansystem should be by law established for investigating complaints ofmaladministration by local government.    The activities of localauthorities impinge upon the daily life of the citizens directly andover a wide range and the introduction of a system analogous to thatof the Parliamentary Commissioner into the local government spherewould be a major extension cf the citizen&apos;s right to seek redress.It would not be appropriate for me to go into details of a localombudsman system at this time.    There must first be discussions withthe local authority associations and other bodies concerned.    TheGovernment will thereafter present detailed proposals in the context of local government reorganisation.    We do envisage, however, thata local ombudsman system would be separate from the parliamentary commissioner system;  that its scope in relation to local governmentaffairs would be similar to the scope of the important in central governmentaffairs; and that reports on complaints would be made to the appropriatelocal authority.As to health service administration, ray rt. hon. Friend theSecretary of State for Social Services informed the House on 19th Ivlaythat he was convinced that there was a substantial case for a healthcommissioner, though such an office should not be confused in its functions with the new hospital advisory service he is now in process
of setting up.    It will be necessary to consider, in consultation with the professional and other interests, how far the new service, when it is established, meets one side of the problem;  the relationship of anycommissioner to the new service;  and also other problems of definition,for example where complaints may involve clinical matters.    These arequestions which the Health Ministers will be considering as part of theproposals now being worked out for the future administrative structure of the health service.These would be major extensions of the ombudsman service andwill take time to work out, legislate and apply.    But I think that theHouse will be glad to have this statement of the Governments intentions in this matter, which represent a further important step in the consistentline of policy which v/e have followed on grievance machinery for the citizen.-6 m
