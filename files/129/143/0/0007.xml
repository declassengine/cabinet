DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(69) 8215th July, 1969CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  1970-71Memorandum by the chancellor ellor of the exchequer this is a report on progress towards fulfilling the remit from theCabinet (CC(69) 3ist Conclusions, Minute 2) to discuss with mycolleagues proposals for savings which would secure a reductionin public expenditure in 1970-71 of  400 million.Schemes for the reductions2.      I circulated three broad schemes (C(69) 72).    All of themassumed that we could not reduce social security payments in 1970-71,but that we should secure  150 million from a combination of the defence budget and the nationalised industries&apos; capital programmes.    We shallnot have the report on the nationalised industries until next week, andexamination of new defence costings is still going on.    But from workalready done I am confident that it is realistic to expect the full 150 million from these sources, including  75 million from theDefence Budget.3,       The remaining  250 million would come under Scheme I(as set out in the table in C(69) 72) from reducing the rate of growth of programmes so that none grows faster than 3 per cent;  under scheme II from a reduction of 2. 3 per cent across the board; andunder Scheme III from a reduction of half this amount for education and health and welfare and of 3 per cent for the rest.    My discussions have shown that Scheme I would be too harsh on roads and housing, andScheme II on education and health and welfare.    I suggest therefore thatwe should work on Scheme III.    This is repeated in Table I attached,which also shows the rates at which the programmes would be growingif it were to be implemented as it stands.    But before we can be sure that the reductions proposed in it would be the maximum in each case,we shall need to compare the implications for each programme in case we want to temper some at the expense of others.COPY NO.
The discussions4.       The discussions so far have covered the programmes of theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Secretary of State for social services, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Defence, theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs, the President of the Board ofTrade, the Secretary of State for Education and Science, the Ministerof Technology, the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Housing andLocal Government, the Minister of Agriculture, the Lord Privy Seal andthe Minister of Overseas Development.    I hope to have covered severalmore programmes by the time that Cabinet meet, and I will supplementthis report accordingly then.The results5.       The discussions have gone a long way towards converting the broadschemes in my previous papers into specific proposals or assessmentsof implications.    The results are summarised in Table II and set out infull in Table III attached.    Very broadly Table II indicates how we could make savings-amounting to  215 million.Some general comments6.       The discussions have strengthened my belief in the merits of seeking as much of the reductions as we can by a general squeeze,particularly by slowing down the rates of starting capital projects,7.      In considering Table II, the discussions suggest to me thatwe should keep the following points particularly in mind.(i)  To the extent that we rely on a general squeeze on expenditurev/ithout major changes of policy, we must be fully satisfied that theMinisters responsible will be able to ensure conformity with the reduced programmes.    The economies have to be specified, andtheir effect quantified and controlled.(ii)  The measures which we select should have real and fully adequate effect.    Otherwise we risk taking action later, in a moreawkward form and at a more awkward moment.(iii)  I should like to have been able to do more by squeezing current expenditure on goods and services, rather than capital expenditure.    but our influence on local authorities&apos; current expenditure ( 3,457 million in1970-71 attracting Hate Support Grant of 57 per cent) is indirect anduncertain.    This is why I have stressed that we should not rely onsavings in that expenditure unless there is a specific statement ofpolicy in each case which the local government Ministers will beprepared to invoke (we shall need them to confirm this) as ground for withholding all or part of provision under Cost Increase Ordersfor Rate Support Grant in 1970-71.
(iv) I have taken credit in my assessment of the imbalance in 1970-71for the unallocated reduction of  50 million which is built into the 1969Survey for shortfall.    In the discussions several instances have been mentioned of programmes already expected to fall short of Surveyestimates.    We must be chary of estimates of shortfall in specificprogrammes so far ahead, especially as Departments find shortfalldifficult to estimate for most programmes even in the current year.At this stage we can only treat reports of expected shortfall in 1970-71as identification of parts of the unallocated shortfall of  50 million;  andeven in aggregate they do not yet account for all of that amount.(v) In regulating the rate of growth of programmes in 1970-71, wemust avoid rolling so much forward into 1971-72 that we set ourselvesan impossible task for that year.conclusions.       I estimate that if all the entries in column 3 of Table II were included in a scheme of reductions (and none of the increases-in column 4 were permitted without equivalent offsetting savings),the broad effect on the economy would be to eliminate some 80- percent of the prospective imbalance as I have assessed it.    Expressedin these terms the reductions listed are more satisfactory than in money terms because of their high demand effects.    I propose to pursue my discussions in order to establish whether the other 20 percent or so in imbalance terms can be found, and to report further tothe Cabinet next week, when we shall also have before us the reporton nationalised industries capital expenditure.R.H.

MOTES(a) The total for roads and public lighting includes  1.million for roads for Leyland&apos;s factory in Cumberland.This has been offset by a reduction of  1.0 million inthe total for other assistance to employment andindustry, which has been found from the savings arisingfrom the abolition of the S.S.T. additional payments.(b) This figure excludes  19.0 million expenditure by theGoL.C. on London Transport which, as an item formerlywithin the expenditure of nationalised industries, doesnot count against the published limits for public expenditure - see 1969 Survey, main Report,paragraph 25.(c) The Minister of Technology has indicated that  5 million would be taken from the unallocated provision of  18million for projects not yet identified, by stiffeningthe criteria for acceptance of projects.(d) This represents an estimated shortfall in expenditure to be scored against the unallocated  50 millionallowance in the Survey for shortfall.(e) This figure is  1.5 million below the 1969 Surveyforecast because of the decision not to proceed with theIpswich New Town.(f) This represents an estimated shortfall in expenditure(following a rephasing of housing investment in England)to be scored against the unallocated allowance forshortfall.(g) The Minister of Housing and Local Government hasunddrtaken to consider how he could find a total saving of  h7 million from his share in the aggregate of thesetwo programmes, if the ceiling on local authorities&apos;mortgage lending were restored to  55 million for 1969-70.(h) Compared to the 1969 Survey forecast, this figure takes account of a reduction of  1.1 million on school building in England and Wales and an increase of  0.million on school building in Scotland.(j)   The Secretary of State for Education and Science hasoffered  18 million reductions in expenditure on education and local libraries, and is considering the items marked(j) as alternative possibilities for making additional savings.(k)   This reduction in expenditure is to be scored againstthe unallocated provision for shortfall.(1)   This figure excludes  13.0 million expenditure by theNational Savings Committee which, as an item formerlywithin the expenditure of nationalised industries, doesnot count against the published limits for public expenditure - see 1969 Survey, main Report, paragraph 25./     (m)
The Housing Ministers, and the Chief Secretary,Treasury., have papers in hand on expenditure of theLand Commission.     The former envisage an increaseof  10 million in 1970-71 and  1U million in 1971-72;the latter envisages a reduction below the figuresembodied in the Survey.Talks are in progress between the Civil service department and the Treasury on the provision to bemade for the implementation of the recommendations ofthe Ful+on Committee.
