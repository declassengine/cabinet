C(69) 99COPY NO.24th July, 1969CABINETBBC RADIO; finance memorandum by the Postmaster general in Cabinet on 17th July, I was asked to report further on the economies which the BBC mean to make so as to keep radio out of the red.These economies are of two kinds; those deriving from McKinseyIsstudies; and those deriving from the proposed restructuring of the radioservices in the main from much reduced use of live music,2.      McKinsey*s have made no single, written report.    They haveconducted a series of studies over the whole of the British broadcasting corporation^ (BBC) activities.    I have spoken about these studies first with Lord Hill and Mr, Charles Curren, Director General; andseparately with Mr. Roger Morrison, leader of the McKinsey team.3.      The economies deriving from these studies, and from further examination by the BBC themselves of the cost-effectiveness of their organisation comprise a number of small items throughout theorganisation but falling under these two main heads;Savings1973-741970-74(i)Productivity improvements in London ProgrammeDepartments and in RegionalProduction Centres 1 million 3.3 million(&quot;)Productivity improvements and cut-backs in central management and ancillaryadministrative services 0,5 million 2 million 1.5 million  5. 3 million-1-
Given the continuing pressure on the BBC over the period 1963 to 1969to make do without the  6 licence for which they had asked. I do not thinkIt surprising that there are no large single items of economy.Mr. Roger Morrison of McKxnseyts was adamant that savings comparable to the live music savings could not be found except by cutting deeply intoprogramme, standards.    I understand that, in the letter accompanyingtheir preliminary findings, McKinsey1s described BBC television as thebest in the world from the point of view of both quality and cost.   Also,although the staff savings involved In the economies noted above will bemet as far as possible through normal wastage, there will be redundancies.Altogether, I am reasonably satisfied that the BBC are not being too tender.4.      On the economies from structural changes, the biggest single itemis In reduced live music broadcastings involving the disbandment of at least three of the BBCs orchestras.    The total savings this would produce inthe four years up to March, 1974 is  5 million.    The other restructuringproposals i.e. the development of &quot;generic&quot; networks and the eliminationon English regional opt-outs, when local radio is sufficiently established,would save  1 million (after deduction of certain consequential additionalcosts, e.g. redundancy payments) over the period.    It is not in my view in question that the BBC have too many orchestras, for their broadcastingneeds.    They cannot find broadcasting time for enough live performancesto keep all their orchestras sufficiently employed.    Nor can they use their full repeat rights agreed with the Musicians1 Union.    Further^ theycannot find many outside engagements for their orchestras without prejudicing the survival of other orchestras.    Thus, in order to preserve the Scottish National Orchestra, they have agreed that the BBC ScottishSymphony Orchestra will not perform publicly in Scotland.5,      I am satisfied that the BBCTs proposals are not a posture designedto stampede opinion into accepting a licence fee increase,,    But though inpurely operational terms, they have a respectable case, this is not theonly consideration.    There is the further question, to which I attach great importance, whether they have a continuing duty of patronage of the cultural activities of the country, well beyond the needs of broadcasting.Due to run until 1976, their present Charter was presumably granted on thetacit expectation that they had such a duty.6.      My conclusion is that, having found all the economies theyreasonably can in general administration and production, they cannot beexpected to support live music on the present scale unless they are put inadditional funds.    We cannot say both that they must maintain all theirorchestrasj and that we will not provide them with the means.J.T.S,General Post Office, E.C.1.23rd July, 1969m 2**
