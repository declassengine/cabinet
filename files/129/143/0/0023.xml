C(69) 9822nd July, 1969RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTSNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer at a meeting of Ministers on the 14th July most of those present,including the Ministers with responsibility for race relations and for the placing of contracts, were in favour of including a clause in government contracts which would require contractors to comply with the PeaceRelations Act, 1968.    They proposed that future contracts should be withheld only after consideration of particular cases by Ministers andthat going contracts should not normally be cancelled.2.      The Attorney-Generals memorandum (C(69) 94) explains the doubts which he and the Lord Chancellor expressed at that meeting.3.      The issue involves a niee balance of political and legalconsiderations.    The Attorney-General has pointed out that as a strictmatter of law a clause is not needed and does not add to our powers.    Ithas also been opposed by both the Confederation of British Industry andthe Trades Union Congress.    But lam glad that the Attorney-Generaldoes not press his objection to the point of ruling out the use of a clause,since I am convinced that there are persuasive arguments for its adoption.    It has been strongly advocated by the Race Relations Board,who attach the greatest importance to its declaratory effect and feel that itwould have a more vivid impact than any other exhortation.    It is wellknown that we have been considering the matter and to abandon the clausewould be interpreted as a retreat from our own policy,4.      I agree that care should be taken about the imposition of sanctions.I propose that no action 3hould be taken under the clause without referenceto the Minister concerned, and no doubt Ministers would consult their colleagues a3 appropriate.    It may be that there would rarely, or never, bea wish to impose sanctions.    The main use of the clause Is likely to bethat it would offer Departments a point of reference when assisting the race Relations Board to achieve a settlement.    As such it could be usefulas well as being an earnest of our good faith.R.H. J,Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.22nd July, 1969COPY NO.    &quot; cabinet
