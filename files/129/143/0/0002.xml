import&apos; saving-i.    introductionWhen Ministers took the decision to devalue it was assumed that the change in parity would have a substantial effect onthe growth of imports.    It was also thought at the time thatthe volume response of imports to devaluation would developmore rapidly than that of exports.    Since devaluation, severelydeflationary fiscal and monetary measures have been taken,coupled in November 1968 with the more direct action on importsof the import deposit scheme.2.   Nevertheless, in each short-term forecast since devaluation,the import projections have had to be raised in the light of experience.   Total imports for 1968 turned oat  550m. more thanthe post-Budget forecast made in aipril 1968, and the latestforecast for 1969 is nearly  500m. above that made at thebeginning of last year, despite all the measures applied inthe meantime.   Meanwhile exports, aided by an unexpectedlyrapid growth of world trade, have increased faster than wasforecast, the out-turn for 1968 exceeding by  12Um. the forecastmade in February 1968.   But the gain here has been much less thanthe shortfall on the import forecast, with the result that the desired surplus has receded further into the future./Short-term1.

Prima facie, therefore, something has gone seriously wrong with the devaluation strategy, and it would seem that it is in the imports sectorthat the disappointment of our hopes and expectations has been concen-Hjtrated.   The significance of this experience is examined further inSection III below:    as a preliminary to this discussion it may be useful to review the way things were moving in the ten years before devaluation,-I11   INDUSTRIJdl^OjCPJiTITIVENESS. EXPORTS AMD IMPORTSJU.   The lack of international competitiveness of British industry has[teen increasingly apparent for a number of years and has shown itself inII2* /our
our balance of payments difficulties.   One indicator of the deterioration is the movement of the ratio of total imports to total exports.   As the table shows, over the eleven years from 1957to 1968 the U.K. ratio has risen while that of all our main tradingcompetitors, except the United States, has declined.TABLE AImport:    export ratios for all commodity trade(imports cif, exports fob, current prices throughout)Year	UK	USA(a)	Canada^a^ j	Japan j	West j	France,,, .

If we confine the comparison to manufactures the same pictureemerges.   Though other large countries besides the U.K. and the USAhave seen their imports of manufactures rise faster than their exports,the ratio has risen much more in the case of the U.K. than in any other of the main countries expept the United States.3. /TABLE B

The same pattern is repeated in a comparison confined to finished manufacturers.

7.     Import/export ratios of course reflect the quality of a country&apos;s export performance equally with its propensity to import.As the President of the Board of Trade has pointed out (SEP(69)39),the ratio of the increase in imports to the increase in G.N.P. is nohigher in the U.K. than in the other principal industrial countries;it is indeed somewhat lower than in most of them.     Our importshave increased at a substantially faster percentage rate than our national income, hut much the same relation is found in Germany,the United States, France and Italy (though not in Japan).     Fromthis the inference may he drawn that if our exports had shown thesame capacity for growth as those of our principal competitors, weshould not have had any difficulty in financing a growth of importsat the rate which has in fact been experienced.8.     In fact, however, our exports did not sho&apos;w the necessarycapacity for growth.     No one, therefore, would dispute that thelong-term performance of our economy in this respect has been seriously unsatisfactory, nor can there be any doubt of the needfor an active policy of export promotion.     But this docs not mean that there is no need to be concerned about imports.     v/hether ornot there is evidence of weakness manifesting itself on the importside, it is important, given the persisting weakness of our balanceof payments, to take all possible legitimate steps to reduce theimport bill.     A gain to the balance of payments is grist to the mill wherever in the accounts it arises.Ill    IMPORTS SINCE DEVALUATION9.     Devaluation was expected to lead to an increase in the volumeof exports and to a reduction in the volume of imports.     Each oft- /the se
these would contribute to the strengthening of the balance of pay-ments which was the objective, and although the export effect was expected to be the larger the import effect was expected to be substantial.     In the February 1968 forecast an allowance of 5175m.for the effect of devaluation in reducing the import volume in1968, and the ultimate annual saving was put at  340m.10.    The table given in Section I above shows how the import fore-casts have had to be successively revised upwards, with devastatingeffects on the original hopes for improvement in the visible tralebalance.     As the table below shows, the excess of actual overTABLEImports, forecast a.nd,jactual^ Jjj68(balance of payments basis, excluding U.S. aircraft)Forecast AcjtualFeb.1968Import volume (1967 = 100) 100.4 109.4Import prices 11 110.4 111.4Value of imports.      11 111.0 121.9forecast imports in 1968 arose essentially on the side of volume,the overall rise in import prices having been only slightly higherthan had been expected (reflecting sharp rises in prices of somenon-competitive imports, with competitive import prices risingless than expected).11.   Before devaluation the volume of imports had been rising at about 41% a year on average     Over the eighteen month periodseparating the two middle quarters of 1967 from the periodOctober 1968-March 1969, the rise in import volume was at therate of 6f% a year.     It is true that since mid-1968 the level of6. /imports
imports has flattened out, hut this is no   comfort in itself:what we have to consider is the level at which they have flattenedout, and what this level implies for the forces acting on our import hill.     As the figures given above show, a comparison overthe whole period from before devaluation to the winter of 1968/9,i&apos;e* aft.off &quot;the flattening out, shows an acceleration of the risecompared with the period up to 1967.      There is no reason to suppose that the flattening is any more than a temporary reaction to the slackening of the domestic economy and the imposition of import depositsj    a renewed rise is likely to follow as thegrowth of production picks up again, and will be intensified whenthe deposit scheme ends.12.   The paper by the President analyses the causes of this sharprise and emphasises the importance of(1)    the special factors behind the increased imports of silver and diamonds;(2)    certain imports of particular products arising fromabnormal and temporary requirements, e.g. tyres, steel pipes;-    (3)    abnormally high imports of food, feed, drink andtobacco1(4)    the fact that in certain sectors of semis and of finished manufacturers overseas suppliers reduced their prices in over-seas currency in order to avoid or minimise the rise in the sterling price;    and(5)    the fact that the growth of demand was faster than hadbeen allowed for in the forecast./13.    Though7.
13,    Though these are clearly relevant and important points, I donot feel that they give us much comfort.     While it is no doubttrue that there is an element of temporary fluctuation in thehigh import of food, feed, drink and tobacco, we are not entitledto assume that this is all it amounts to:    it may be entirelytemporary, but it may not.     v/hile the high imports of tyres andsteel pipe may prove a passing phase, we must expect that other special needs will arise, as they tend to do from time to time,e.g. from decimalisation.     The fact that in some sectors thereY/as substantial price absorption &quot;by foreign suppliers suggeststhat they enjoyed a large margin of superiority and that the competitive strength of U.K. industry was weaker than wasappreciated.     In regard to capital goods imports the increase was out of proportion to domestic economic growth and suggestiveof uncompetitiveness both in price and technology, with implications for the future which surely cannot be regarded with complacency.Imports of consumer goods were higher than would have beenpredicted by the regression equations fitted to previous experience, and the only explanation proferred is that the pressure of domestic demand in 1968 was higher than the unemploy-ment figures would indicate.14.   The striking fact that emerges is that even after making-generous allowances for the factors cited in the Board of Tradepaper, there is no evidence in the figures of any substantialeffect of devaluation on the volume of imports.15.   We have, in fact, to accept one of two alternativeconclusions4     Either the effect of devaluation on imports was/very
very small, and if so this calls for explanation given that exports have seemed tz re-epo:ici to devaluation more or loco ae expected.Or, if the effect of devaluation on imports was in fact substantial,it must have been offset by a large increase in the propensity to import which had not been appreciated, probably because of theeffect of the T.I.C,     Whichever of the two we believe, thesituation is thoroughly disquieting.     Either the strategy of operating on the balance of payments through costs and prices hasbeen substantially ineffective on the import side, or it has been to a great extent cancelled out by a change in the propensity to import, so that the underlying problem in November 1967 was on a-much greater scale than was then appreciated and was of a differentnature.16.    Several factors have no doubt combined to limit the impact of devaluation on imports.      In some sectors,, as mentioned ahove,overseas suppliers have held down their sterling prices.    in others, factors other than price may have been more important tothe consumer, who continued to buy foreign goods in spite of theprice advantage to British producers.    In some sectors, e.g.certain chemicals and some kinds of machinery, the lack of productive capacity at home prevented a switch away from foreignsupplies.   Finally, there may well have been sectors where importscould have been replaced but where British industry has so farfailed to see or to respond to the opportunity.17.    I cannot agree that this situation gives no cause for concern.It seems to me clear that something has gone very wrong with ourstrategy for righting the balance of payments, so far as the importside is concerned, and that we are badly in need of a convincingpolicy for remedying the position. /IV9*
IV     IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE18.   The figures given in Section I show how over the lasteighteen months the expectation about the level of future importshas been successively revised upwards.    This of course lias meant that the level of future exports required to achieve a givenbalance of visible trade has also had to be revised upwards.    InThe.....Task Ahead it was assumed that the volume of imports would increase at k% a year, and on this basis it was calculated that exports would need to increase by        a year to achieve a favour-able trade balance of  200-300 million in the period up to 1972.This compares with a growth in export volume at about 3% a year in the years before devaluation, but in view of the shift to fastergrowing markets and products an increase of about 1%,  i.e. to L\.f0a year, was thought to be likely even without allowing for deval-uation or other export-promoting policies.    Thus the measure ofthe 1 extra&apos; growth in exports and re-exports required in the period up to 1972 on the assumptions in The Task Ahead could be put atlf% a year (i.e., 5f% less the sum of 3% and 1%).19.   However, the rate of growth of import volume on which thiscalculation was based was at the low figure of u% a year, and itwas realised that a figure as low as this could only be justified by assuming effective import saving measures (such as the assist-ance to the aluminium smelters, agriculture etc.) additional tothe effects expected from devaluation.    If imports were toincrease at 1$% a year, which would be broadly in line with thepre-devaluation trend, then exports would have to rise bya year instead of 5f%.    If imports were to increase at the10. /rate
rate which the Board of Trade have recently suggested as areasonable trend projection for the M.T.A.C. (a mean of 5%)the required growth rate for exports would exceed 7%. This is because the rate of rise of the propensity to import is assumed to be increasing.    If, on the other hand,  imports have to be re-strained . by further deflation, then this would have unacceptableconsequences which are discussed briefly in paragraph 21 below.20.    The industries consulted in the discussion with theE.D:.C.s, who have to bear the main weight of responsibility forthis increase in exports, appear to regard even the 5f-% as avery difficult target to achieve,  so that it seems unrealistic to base our strategy on confident hopes of a still larger increasThis means that if our hopes of economic growth are to be realisewe must at least achieve the effect on imports which was envisaged in the Green Paper.21.    The policy implications appear clearly in the forecastprepared by the Medium-Term Assessment Committee (M.T.A.C.) andis highlighted in their Basic Case II.    On the basis of aprudent assumption about the prospects for export growth andthe propensity to import,  it is calculated that to realise oventhe modest target of a  300 m. surplus on the balance of payments( 200m. less than the Green Paper target to which the figuresof paras,18 and 19 above were related) the growth of imports would have to be held down to k-g-^ per annum.    To achiuvc this it would be necessary to restrict the growth of G.D.p. to 2^ba year on average and to accept a rise in unemployment to 2f&apos;/o11/22.
22.    The prospect in the previous paragraph, despite thewelcome and indeed essential improvement in the trade figuresfor May, is unlikely to recede unless further improvement inthese figures takes place and unless this is sustained for asufficient period.    Certainly, so far our overseas positionand performance since devaluation are not such that we can sitback and wait for this improvement to develop.    It seems highlyprobable, even if not yet fully established, that there is alarge sector of British industry whose responsiveness to thestimuli of relative costs, prices and market opportunitiescreated by macro-economic measures such as devaluation is very low.    In all these circumstances it is no more than prudencefor us to take all effective steps open to us to see that ourposition and performance in the trade field do in fact improveto the formidable extent necessary if we are to achievesolvency and stability.23.    I am sure that more can be done by way of measures directedspecifically to import saving.     We should press ahead with thedevelopment of our supplies of gas (and possibly oil) from theContinental shelf on both sides of Great Britain and with our agricultural expansion programme.   We should make sure that duepriority is being given to those of the Ministry of Technology&apos;sprojects, such as those for the machine tool and computerindustries, in which the import saving prospects are particularlypromising.2k.    In addition, I think we should make preparation for theintensification of the micro-economic and industrial policies12. /aimed
aimed at the improvement of industrial efficiency, on thebroadest concept of market orientation - that is to say thedirection of company policies towards effective competition in markets at home and abroad.     A considerable programme of workin this field is already in hand as part of the industrialconsultations based on our Economic assessment to 1972, &quot;The TaskAhead&quot;.   But I have in mind to intensify this work as soon aspracticable in respect of its import substitution aspects andof seeking more direct contact with the decision-making points of industry, both on the buying and selling sides, than ispossible under the useful but relatively indirect approach fromthe E.D.O,s.13.SECRIT
