C(69)10025th July, 1959COPY NO.CABINE&apos;THE FUTURE CONTROL OF LOCAL AUTHORITYRENT increases memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Future Policy Sub-Committee of the Ministerial Prices and incomes Committee (PI(F)) has been considering the possible content of future prices and incomes policy after the expiiy at the end of 1969 of mostof the statutory powers provided in the Prices and Incomes Act, 1968.These include powers to control increases in the rents charged by localauthorities for houses,    PI(F) proposes to authorise consultation on thissubject during August and September with the Local authority associations and the Greater London Council (GLC) and I seek theagreement of my colleagues on the line to be taken in discussions withthese organisations.Present Statutory Powers and their effect2.      Part III of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1968 gave the Governmentpower to control rent increases by local authorities.    These powersrequire the approval of the appropriate Minister for any increase incouncil housing rents,, and they have been used to hold rent increases,almost without exception, within limits of 7s. 6d a week for the average increase and 10s. a week for the maximum increase for any dwelling,in any 12 month period.    Within these limits, increases have been permitted only where, broadly speaking, a local authority would otherwise have had to make a larger than usual.rate fund contribution.As a result, the average rent increase in England and Wales in 1968-69and 1969-70 is likely to be only about ls,10d a week in each year.    InScotland the average standard rent for local authority houses increasedby about 2s, 4d in 1968,    These figures compare with average increases in England and Wales of 3s, Id and 4s. a week in the two years preceding1968-69, and in Scotland of 8d and Is, lid a week in the two years before1968,-1-
3.      As well as making substantial reductions in local authority rent increases which were determined before the 1968 Act became law9 inEngland the Government has rejected over a quarter of the new proposalsfor rent increases, and the use of the powers under the Act has led to reducing, postponing or eliminating increases proposed for about one million tenants.    In Scotland about 10 per cent of proposals for localauthority rent increases have been rejected and the powers under the Actwere used in cases covering 46, 000 tenants.4.      Of the increases permitted, over 75 per cent have been for 5s.a week or lesG, though in Greater London proportionately more authoritieshave made increases and of these most have been on or near the 7s. 6dlimit.5.      The restraint in local authority rent increases has been mainlyachieved by running down the housing balances.    But both in England andWales and in Scotland the point has now been reached where, in general,any further restriction of rent increases will mean a higher rate fundcontribution than has so far been normal.    Thus the opportunities for preventing or reducing rent increases are bound to be far fewer in thefuture.Alternatives for Future policy.      Pl(F) has considered the alternatives of renewing by fresh legislation the powers provided by the Prices and Incomes Act, 1968, orof reaching agreement with the Local Authority Associations and the GLCon a voluntary system, by which local authorities would undertake to observe agreed guidelines.    The Sub-Committee has also considered whether the limits to be imposed by statutory powers or set out inguidelines should be the same as at present, or possibly lower.7.      Some members of the Sub-Committee have argued that statutory powers are needed to ensure that local authorities, most of which arenow Conservative-controlled, do not make unjustified increases (eventhough within the limits of any agreed guidelines) with the deliberate aim off off-loading the burden as much as possible from the rates to councilhouse rents.    They argue also that the Government will not escape the blame for permitting local authority rent increases, and that accordinglyit should have the power to intei*vene effectively.    They suggest there isa serious danger that local authorities who have been prevented in the lastyear or so from raising their rents may, when statutory powers havelapsed, rush forward with substantial increases.    However little creditthe Government may have won for its rent restraint policy, It will thenearn a great deal of odium for effectively abandoning it.8.      Against this view, other members of the Sub-Committee argue that,with housing balances now largely eliminated, the choice in future will be between a local authority rent increase and a rate increase.    TheGovernment therefore, whether it permits or refuses a rent increase, will-2-
stand to be criticised either by the tenants or by the ratepayers; and whenit permits part of an increase requested, it will be blamed by both parties.It might therefore be better to let Conservative-controlled local authoritiestake the whole responsibility for resolving the dilemma.    Moreovercontinued control of local authority rent increases would give manyConservative authorities an excuse for unjustifiably reducing their councilhouse building programmes and blaming the Government for it.    Therewould also be public expenditure consequences of continuing specialrestraints on local authority rent increases, since increases in rate fundcontributions are an addition to public expenditure and count against thetotal spending limits which we have set outselves.9.      The Sub-Committee recognise that there might need to be special treatment for Scotland, though in practice the fixing of maximum figuresfor local authority rent increases seems to have had the effect there ofmaking substantial increases respectable, and thus encouraging a startupon the necessary process of raising Scottish local authority rents alittle nearer prevailing English and Welsh levels.10,      On the figures to be taken as the maxima in either the exercise of statutory powers or the fixing cf guidelines for a voluntary system, some members of the Sub-Committee thought that an increase of as much as10s, a year was too great for many council house tenants to bear0Against this, other members of the Sub-Committee thought that continuing the ceiling figures at their present level would be acceptable to localauthorities,, who had become accustomed to them and that any lower ceilingwould oblige too many authorities to increase their rate fund contributions.They also considered that lowering the ceiling figures after the end of 1969would imply a change in Government policy on local authority rent controlsfor which there was no justification.Consultation with Labour Party11,       At the request of PI(F), consultation took place with TransportHouse and the Parliamentary Labour Party about the possibility of continuing the present statutory powers.    In England, questionnaires were sent to the Labour Groups of those local authorities (except Rural district councils) not under Labour control, where there has been government intervention on rents under the Prices and Incomes Act, 1968; representa-tive individuals from 22 local authorities were asked for their views and regional organisers in the Labour Party for an assessment of the effecton local elections of Government intervention on council rents; and two meetings v/ere held of the Housing and Local Government Group of LabourMPs,    From these sources there emerged an even balance of opinion forand against the continuation of the present statutory powers; and a low rate of response from local authority Labour Groups suggests no widespreadinterest or deep feeling among them on the subject.    In the parliamentary labour Party, both support for and opposition to continuing the powers was expressed in all sections of the Party.    The same procedure was followed-3-
Treasury Chambers, S. W.1,24th July, 1969-4-in Scotland and a meeting was held wltii the executive of the parliamentary labour Group.    The replies from representative Individuals and fromMPs in general favoured continuing legislative controls and the latterthought that a voluntary system next year would not reati-ain thoao localauthorities who had been prevented this year from making rent increases in full.12.      On the whole the consultations with various elemento in the LabourParty do not seem to point decisively in cither direction.Proposed basis for consultation with Local Authority AaHocationo13.      After some discussion, a majority of Pl(F) agreed that the LocalAuthority Associations and the GLC should be consulted about the proposalto have a voluntary system of control over rent increased, by which localauthorities would undertake to avoid ront increases wherever possible and to keep them to as modest a level as possible,, and v/ould agree thatin any 12 month period no rent Increase should exceed 7ra0 6d a week on average or involve individual increases of more than 10s. a week.    TheLocal Authority Associations and tho GLC would be told that any 3uchvoluntary system would bo accompanied by statutory powers in reservepermitting Government control of rent increases above the ceiling, andthat, if the voluntary agreement were broken, chose powers would bebrought into effect by a Ministerial direction, which could be either general or aimed specifically at an offending authority.14.      I invite my colleagues to agree that consultation with the LocalAuthority Associations and the GLC should take place on the basis set outin the preceding paragraph with a view to our reconsidering the subject and taking a final decision on this element of future prices and incomes policy later in the year, In the light of the outcome of these consultations.
