C(69) 9622nd July. 1969NATIONALISED INDUSTRIESt INVESTMENT REVIEW&apos;  1   1        1 &quot;   memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the outcome cf the interdepartmental review of nationalisedIndustries1 investment programmes has already been circulated to theCabinet (C(69) 80).    The Note by Officials proposes programmes totalling 1,480 million in 1969-70,  1,531 million in 1970-71 and  1,493 million in1971-72.    These figures include a central unallocated allowance forshortfall, but exclude investment by London Transport after the end of1969.    In addition, officials have identified a number cf options on someof the programmes which would reduce expenditure below these figures.2.      I suggest that my colleagues should endorse those programmes onwhich no investment options are proposed, namely National Coal Board,Electricity Council and Boards, British Transport Docks Board, BritishWaterways Board, Transport Holding Company and National freight corporation.3.      The maximum investment options identified on the remainingprogrammes total  43 million in 1970-71 and  76 million in 1971&quot;72.Various other options have been identified on the financial objectives andpricing policies for several of the industries.   An early decision must inany event be taken on the financial objectives for the gas and electricityindue tries.4.      As I indicated in C(69) 82, I am looking for savings of about 75 million from the investment programmes of the nationalised industries in 1970-71.5.      As a result of the review by officials, the prospective reduction inthe 1970-71 figure for nationalised industries investment, as comparedwith the total assumed in the Public Expenditure Survey Committee and medium Term Assessment Committee reports, after making a centralunallocated allowance for shortfall, totals  52 million.    Some 25 million must therefore still be found.-1-COPY NO.CABINET
6,     It is also clear that reductions will be needed in the 1971-72programmes.    I suggest we should defer decisions on 1971-72 untilthe autumn, when we shall be looking at the rest of public expenditure for that year.Prgoosed reductions in 1970-717.     I have considered the various options highlighted in the officials1report.     There would be difficulties about some of them even though they are technically possible - e. g. in the telecommunications programme,which would mean, cutting back profitable business and would haveundesirable implications for employment in the Development Areas.And I accept officials&apos; recommendation that an -order should now beplaced for a Scottish power station at Inverkip,   and that there should beat least one Central Electricity Generating Board order in 1970, tosmooth the flow of work to plant manufacturers even though in the lightof the forecasts of electricity demand it might strictly be justifiable to defer these orders.8.     I believe, however, that there is a strong case fcr some of theother options identified by officials.    The two programmes which appearto offer the most promising scope for a significant reduction in expenditurein 1970-71 without longer term detriment to the industries concerned arethe suggested reduction of  12 million for the gas industry and theproposed reduction for the British Railways Board (BEB).9.     I think that we should go for the full   12 million reduction for the gas industry.    It is by no means clear that expenditure on the scale proposed by the industry for next year is either strictly necessary, oroperationally feasible.    At a time when painful cuts are being made inother programmes it does not seem justifiable to approve the gasprogramme at the full level proposed.    As far as the BRB is concerned,some reduction is also required for similar reasons, though I would not propose that it should be more than  5 million.10,    Elsewhere in the Transport and Aviation sectors some otherreductions also seem justified.    These are smaller individually, but in aggregate we need them to reach the total at which we are aiming.    Ipropose that we make minor reductions in the programmes of theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC), British European Airways(BEA) and the British Airports Authority (BAA), including the defermentof the turn house extension, totalling  3. 0 to  3.5 million.    We shouldalso agree to minor deferments in the London Transport Board programme and the postponement of the Fleet Line for a further year, noting thatthis will not rank as nationalised industry investment beyond the end ofthis year, but that it is still public expenditure; and I suggest that we agree to half the reduction proposed in the programme of the NationalBus Company (namely   0. 8 million) ; I also suggest we accept the option on the Scottish Transport Group programme,,    These reductionstotal  7 million,11, The options which I propose we should choose would achieve a totalsaving of approximately  24 million in 1970-71,&quot; 2 o&quot;*
12.    New financial objectives have to be set for the gas and electricity industries.    Discussion will be needed with the industries onthis.    The   1967 White Paper on Nationalised industries Economic andFinancial Objectives (Cmnd. 3437) laid down the Governments generalpolicy on pricing and investment from which financial objectives shouldbe expected to follow.    I do not suggest any departure from these principles.    But the need to settle financial objectives at the present justice also makes it necessary to consider whether the level of the objectives should be specifically and directly related to the current discussions on the level of public expenditure generally.    This question arises because some reduction in the prospective imbalance in the economy could be achieved by fixing the gas and electricity objectivesat a level which would imply higher prices - or earlier price increases -than might otherwise be needed.    This would reduce consumerpurchasing power and company profits and so help to remove theimbalance.13.    There would, however, be disadvantages in going for higherobjectives than the 7 per cent proposed by the Minister of Power, at atime when there is surplus capacity in the electricitv industry, andwhen we are wanting to see natural.gas introduced as fast as possiblebecause of the advantage to the balance of payments to the extent thatnatural gas is substituted for imported oil,14.    For theee reasons I would not wish to press the case for financial objectives higher than 7 per cent for the gas and electricity industries,provided we can secure the total saving on expenditure in 1970-71 whichwe need.    But if we failed to achieve this, then I think we might have toconsider very seriously the case for higher financial targets for gas and electricity,    A 5 per cent price increase for gas and electricity inthe early months of 1970 would increase the industries&apos; receipts byabout  85 million in that year.    This would mean a substantial contribu-tion towards reducing the prospective imbalance for that year.15,    From an economic point of view it would be even more welcome ifthe higher target could be achieved by greater efficiency in theindustries concerned, i, e, better       of equipment and labour.    Theresource effect would be even more beneficial than that obtained through charging higher prices.    Whatever level of financial objectivesis fixed, the industries ahould be urged to increase their productivity as rapidly as possible, and. it must be made clear to them that this is ofgreat significance not merely for their own profitability but for the strengthening of the economy generally.16,    Officials also draw attention to the possibility of a contribution which could be made by raising the financial objective (and in consequenceprobably the tariffs) for the telecommunications services of the PostOffice,    I hope my colleagues will agree that officials should be instructed to examine the possibilities on this front.
