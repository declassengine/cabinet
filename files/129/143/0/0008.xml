DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST yS GOVERNMENT)C(69) 8315th July, 1959CHARGES IN THE NATIONAL HEALTH service memorandum, by the Secretary of State for Social services on 10th July (CC(69) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 1), the cabinet invited me, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to circulate a memorandum on the principle of charges in the national health Service,    I have consulted the Chancellor and he will also besubmitting a memorandum.2.      The 25 per cent increase in charges for dentures and spectaclesis in itself a very minor adjustment of prices to cost.    It followednaturally on the 50 per cent increase in the dental treatment chargewhich was approved last spring in the Commons without a division.!In contrast to prescription charges which raised a Parliamentary stormin May, a Prayer against this Order tabled by two Liberals in Aprilattracted no support.    Yet the announcement 12 months later of increased charges for teeth and spectacles at once aroused deep-felt emotionsamong our backbenchers.    Partly no doubt this was due to maladroittiming but the strength of the opposition stems very largely I think froma suspicion that by such minor upward adjustments the Government isbit by bit building charges into the system of Health Service finance.Thus it is feared that prescription charges, which were believed to bea temporary crisis measure, are being used to introduce a permanent and major change in Government policy.    K this analysis is correct itwill not be sufficient next Monday merely to show that the charge forteeth and spectacles is sensible and that it should be kept in a reasonablerelation with costs.    Instead of considering how I should justify thisparticular increase we must review the whole issue of the part charges should play in financing the Health Service.3.      At present charges imposed by the central Government yieldabout  55 million a year, or less than 4 per cent of the total cost of the health Service in Great Britain.    About  12 million comes from charges for pay and amenity beds,  18 million from prescription charges, and 25 million from dental treatment, denture and spectacle charges.    This-1-COPY NO.

 55 million derived from charges should be compared with the 180 million derived from the National Health Service contribution andthe  1,350 million from taxation.    I calculate that if the only twopracticable new charges were introduced (bed and board in hospitals and a fee for visiting the doctor) they could not together raise more than another  30 million.    It is clear therefore that unless there is anentirely different approach to the principle of charging, charges can never contribute more than a small proportion of the total cost.4.      The 1946 National Health Service Act explicitly makes theservices provided under the Act free of charge, except where the Actexpressly provides otherwise.    In other words it recognises that thecost of illness should normally be accepted as an obligation of the whole community.    Nye Bevan, in justifying the principle of a generally freeservice when moving the Second Reading of the 1946 Bill, said:  &quot;It iscardinal to a proper health organisation that a person ought not to befinancially deterred from seeking medical assistance at the earliestpossible stage&quot;.    Another way of expressing the same thought is to saythat the Health Service should be paid for by the healthy and free to the sick.5.      This principle however has not been consistently introduced into our health and welfare services.    The 1946 Act expressly authoriseda limited number of charges.    Some of these were simply for the optional U3e of services for which there was no medical need or whichwere more elaborate than necessary; for example, for pay beds andamenity beds in hospitals and the supply of unnecessarily expensiveappliances.    Almost all the rest were for local authority health and welfare services.    In these latter services the principle of not chargingduring sickness has not been consistently followed.    For example,charges may be made for home helps or the hire of nursing equipment.They are regularly increased to meet increased costs, and these increases do not seem to attract adverse publicity.    Prescription,dental and optical charges were authorised by later Acts.Public attitude to charges as a deterrent6.      The Gallup polls over many years have shown that there is alarge segment of public opinion which accepts the case for certaincharges as a deterrent against waste and abuse.    Even the reintroduction of prescription charges was received with large scale acquiescence andhad no apparent ill effect on the public image of the Health Service.The indifference of public opinion to my recent announcement on teethand spectacles v/as in startling contrast to the storm which it aroused,not only in Westminster but throughout the Labour Party outside.    to judge by every available piece of evidence there is still overwhelmingsupport in the Party for what it regards as the most essential firstprinciple of the Health Service - that the healthy should pay for the sick.-2-
7.       I do not think that we can discard this principle.    The LabourParty*s 1964 manifesto not only contained a specific pledge to abolish theprescription charge but stated our aim to restore as rapidly as possible a completely free Health Service,    The principle announced byKenneth Robinson in the House in 1965 was that the Labour Party &quot;doesnot believe that taxing people when they are sick is an appropriate method of financing health services&quot; (Hansard 9. 2. 66. , Column 426).8.      Nevertheless the Prime Minister announced following devaluation two decisions:  (a) to increase the charge for dentaltreatment; and (b) to reintroduce prescription charges.    He described the latter as &quot;a reluctant decision&quot; and in a letter to Mr. Pavitt he stated that it would be wrong to assvime that the charges carried the implication of a permanent change in Government policy or its approach to Health Service financing (Hansard 1, 7, 69., Column 291).9.       The case for restating our attitude to prescription charges is greatly strengthened by the problems we have encountered since thecharges were reintrodnced.    The Prime Ministers original announcement in specifying the categories it was intended to exempt expressly included the chronic sick.    In fact children and those of 65 or over are exempted -as well as a very few patients suffering from a very limited range of specific conditions always needing permanent medication.    Owing to theresolute refusal of the doctors to give any clinical judgment on exemptionwe have not been able to make good the original announcement about the chronic sick.    For example patients suffering from tuberculosis,arthritis, heart disease, or chronic bronchitis do not automaticallyacquire exemption though some may qualify on ground of age or financialhardship.    We have made provision by means of &quot;season tickets &quot; for reducing the financial liability.    But nevertheless the principle thatcharges should not be imposed during sickness is clearly breached.10.      In the second place the system of exemptions as now administeredis devoid of adequate financial safeguards.    Instead of the embossed&quot;Barclaycards&quot; my predecessor intended to introduce we are stillrelying on the signature written on the back of the prescription.Fortunately sample tests have revealed no extensive abuse.    Neverthelesspublic attitudes can easily change and if they did the cost of introducingan embossed card system (about  2 million at present prices) and ofmaintaining it (at lea3t S.% million more than the cost of the present arrangement) would hardly be defensible,11.       My conclusion is that it v/ould be unwise to treat prescription charges - as they have worked out in practice - as permanent;  and thatwe should be v/ell advised, to express our intention when the economicconditions which compelled their introduction have been overcome, toabandon them.    I should however make it clear in any statement the viewof my Department with which I wholly agree that there is no part of thepresent Health Service development which we could sacrifice in order toobtain the  18 million to  25 million necessary (the deterrent force ofprescription charges is difficult to asoess) in order to abolish the charges.-3-
12.       I am clear that abolition of dental and optical charges would not warrant the same amount of priority as abolition of prescription chargesDespite the well-tried exemptions for priority classes they do preventsome patients, particularly elderly patients, from using the services.On the other hand they do not normally transgress the principle thatthe healthy, not the sick, should pay since a patient in need of dentalor optical services is normally not ill in the usual sense or prevented from earning his living.    Moreover these charges which yield a usefulrevenue of  25 million a year have for many years been accepted withcomparatively little resentment.    I am sure it would be a grave error if in order to appease the emotional opposition stimulated by the announce-ment of the increases, we were either to suggest that there was anylikelihood of abolition in the near future or to concede that their value to the Health Service should not be maintained by increases designed tokeep up with costs.13.       My conclusion therefore is that in the forthcoming debate on thePrayer for annulment of the increases I should take the following line:(a) On charges generally I should uphold the principle enunciatedin the 1964 Manifesto and repeated since?(b) I should add that we therefore are bound to attach priority tothe abolition of prescription charges as soon as economic circumstances allow; and(c)*   that the abolition of dental and optical charges though in principleaccepted by the Government, ranks much lower in priority.14.       I annex drafts of the passages I propose to include in my speechcovering this issue.R.H.S.C.Department of Health and Social Security, S.E.1.15th July, 1969-4-
ANNEXIn order  to  present   the   increased charges  for  teethand spectacles   in their proper context  I will  now set out what  the Government&apos;s view is on the  issue  of   the part  chargescan and should  play in  financing the Health  Service.From  the   start   there have   always been some charges   imposed in the Health Service, more particularly-if we  ignore  the optional  extras  -   in  the   local   authority  services,   such ashome help  and nursing equipment.      Nevertheless  the  national health Service Act  specifically makes the  services providedfree of charge except where  the Act expressly providesotherwise.       In other words  it   recognises that  the  cost  of   illnessshould normally be accepted as  the  obligation of  the whole community.       In brief  the principle on which the Health service was based was   that   it  should be  paid for by the healthy and free to the sick.In 1964 the  Labour Party announced  in its election manifesto that  if  it came  to power prescription charges wouldbe abolished:     the aim was  to restore as  rapidly as possible a completely free Health Service.       In the  1966 election after we had abolished prescription charges  it was  still   our aim;and it   is  our  aim  today.       I  say that with all   the moreemphasis because as part  of   the measures  to  reduce public expenditure  following  devaluation  it  became necessary to restore  the prescription charges.      The Prime Minister  told the House   that we were  doing  this with the  greatest  reluctance,and added  that  in addition to  the Tory system of  refunds wewould introduce  a new  system of  exemptions which would covernot only the aged  and children but  also   the chronic   sick.
Faced with a heavy choice between returning  to prescription charges and cutting back the hospital building programme we  felt  compelledto choose  the former but  in doing so we never concealed fromourselves  that prescription charges,   even with  exemptions, cannotbe reconciled with the principle  that  the Health Service shouldbe free to  the sick.    And  this became all  the clearer when, becauseof objections which I   can well  understand  from the medical profession,   exemptions  for   the chronic  sick had to be limitedto a handful  of narrowly defined categories.That   is why  -  although prescription charges  are  making a useful  contribution  to  reducing  the burden of public   expenditure  -it is our  intention when the economic difficulties whichoccasioned them have been successfully overcome to give  thern firstplace  in the list  of  charges due to abolition,  weighing carefully the priority we  can afford  to  the achievement  of a free health service compared with other major, new developments.The  same argument  applies but with much less  force   to charges for dental  and optical  services.    Here  it  cannot be  said  that  the health Service  should be made  free  to  the  sick.     It  can hardly be argued  that  a patient   in need  of  dental  or  optical  services  is normally ill  in  the usual  sense of  the word or  is prevented byhis condition from going to work.    However we have made  special provision through exemption arrangements  for priority classeswhich have worked for  years extremely well.    That perhaps  is whythese particular charges have been accepted by  the public withcomparatively little resentment.    Moreover  they yield a revenue of  25 million a year which we  felt we could not  spare when weabolished prescription charges  and which we certainly cannot afford to give up  today.    Even after  our economic difficulties have been overcome abolition cannot   in the Government  view rate the  samepriority as does  abolition of prescription charges.    And finallyI must add  that  so long as  these charges remain in  force  it  isonly sensible that  they  should be adjusted  from time  to  time soas to cover roughly the  same proportion of  costs.    This  is allthat the Order  this evening i s doing.
