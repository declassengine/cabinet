C(69) 90 COPY NO.21st July, 1969CABINETTHE LAND COMMISSIONS EXPENDITURE ON LANDACQUISITIONNote by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryAt the meeting of the Ministerial Steering Committee on economic policy on 28th January, 1969, I was invited, in consultation with theMinister for Planning and Land and the Minister of Agriculture, toarrange for officials of the Departments concerned to examine theproposed increase in the Land Commission^ expenditure on landacquisition for 1970-71, and to report to the Committee in due course2.      The attached report, which has been agreed between officials ofthe Departments primarily concerned, and which has been delayed inorder to present an up-to-date picture, discusses the provision to bemade for expenditure by the Land Commission on land acquisitions inthe year 1971-72 as v/ell as 1970-71, and invites us to decide theexpenditure and the related provision for borrowing from the national loans Fund to be authorised in both these years,3,      A consideration to be taken into account is how far it may be politically desirable to seek to demonstrate, in terms of the scale ofthe Land Commission&apos;s transactions in land, the continuing importancewe attach to the policy embodied in Part II of the Land Commission Act,1967,    However, the Government have not, hitherto, taken a view onthe appropriate scale of expenditure on land acquisition by the land commission as a matter of the priority we attach to this expenditureIin relation to the claims of other expenditure programmes.    This is what we now need to do.4,      The figures of expenditure proposed by the Housing Depart-ments and the Land Commission exceed those included in PESC bythe following amounts:OCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)

This should mean that the commission s net expenditure would be smaller than the figures in the 1969 Public Expenditure Survey?possibly by some  2- 3 million.J.D.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,18th July, 1969-2-

Acquisi tionReport by officials,    This paper has been prepared by officials in response to the invitation by the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic policy at their meeting on 28th January,  1969,   (SEP(69)3rd Meeting,  Item 4,Conclusion 1), to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury,  in consulta-tion with the Minister for Planning and Land and the Minister ofAgriculture, to arrange for officials of the Departments concerned &apos;to examine the proposed increase in the Land Commissions expenditureen land acquisition for 1970-71, and to report to the Committee irdue course.2,    The Committee also agreed (Conclusion 2) that pending the outcome of this examination the figure for the Land Commission&apos;3expenditure in 1970-71 should remain at  17.6 million as shown inthe 1968 Report by the Public Expenditure Survey Committee(P.E.S.C.).Proposals for expenditure &quot;by the Land Commission3.    In the light of the Ministerial decision mentioned in paragraph2 above, the following figures for expenditure on land acquisition by the Land Commission are being included in the PESC forecasts ofpublic expenditure in the 1969 P.E.S.C. Report:-  million1969-70     1970-71     1971-72     1972-73     1973-7412.4 17.6 19.7 17.7 17.74&apos;    The net expenditure of  12.4 million for 1969-70 is based onthe figure approved by Ministers of  12.8 million, adjusted in thetight of experience.    The figures for 1970-71 onwards correspond totoose included in the 1968 P.E.S.C. Survey, extended by one year.5-   However, as was stated in the 1968 P.E.S.C. Report,  the figures to question were entirely speculative as there was insufficient/information
information. available]jable. at that time about the likely coarse of theCommission1 s activities.    On the basis of further experience and infoe light of the policy advice given to them by the Minister of housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland,foe Commission have submitted net figures of  27.7 million and 33.8 million for 1970-71 and 1971-72 respectively as in their view-representing what is necessary.    The Commission have not felt able to formulate reasonably firm programmes beyond 1971-72 until it was known, what level of activity would be approved for the years 1970-71and 1971-72o    Therefore, for each of the last two years of the fiveyear period covered by the 1969 P.E.S.C. Report they have suggestedaet expenditure of  40 million purely as a holding figure.Accordingly, the following figures will be shown, in the narrativeof the 1969 P.E.S.O. Report:-  million1970-71       1971-72      1972-73       1973-7427.7 33.8 40.0 40.0o.   The basis of these net figures for 1970-71 and 1971-72 is asfollows: -1970-71 1971-72  million       millionLand purchases (gross of levy)         36.6 49,capital works 1,8               2.1Administration 2.2               2.6Total expenditure 40,6 54.less: Sales 12,9 20, net expenditure 27.7 33/87&apos;   When the Commission buy land, they deduct from the market value0-the land the amount of betterment levy which the seller wouldhad to pay on a private sale, and pay the seller the difference,5rt for the purpose of reckoning public expenditure, the cost of theftchase is shown at the market value of the land.   Thus, as the/above
above table shows, net expenditure on land transactions by theCommission represents, for PESO purposes, the difference between thecost of acquisition (gross of betterment levy) plus administrative expenses and cost of capital works on. the one hand, and receipts fromsales on the other.   Expenditure is financed by advances from the(x)national Loans Fund, but the annual borrowing requirementv &apos; is lower than the net expenditure on land transactions primarily because theCommission.&apos;s payments to the owners of the land they buy are madenet of betterment levy.8,    The following sections of this report discuss separately the factors relating to acquisitions, sales and the borrowing requirement.?he elements of the programme of acquisitionsS,    The programme of acquisitions implied in the Land Commission&apos;sproposals for net expenditure in 1970-71 and 1971-72 (paragraph above) has been framed in the light of the policy guidance given tothem by the Housing Ministers.10,   The Commission were initially asked by the Housing Ministers tobe aware of the pressure of demand for land for housing in various parts of the country but particularly in the main pressure areas ofLondon and the Home Counties, the West Midlands conurbation and theNorth West.    They were given the objective of building up the scale of their acquisition programme within the first two years as rapidly as possible.    In Scotland they were asked to provide an even greater proportion than in England and Wales of the land needed for a greatly/increasedfootnote:  ^ The borrowing requirement is made up of:-Land purchases (net of levy)plus: Cost of capital worksAdministrationInterest on accumulated debtless: Sales
iacreased programme of private enterprise housebuilding, particularlyij the central belt.    More recently the Minister for-Planning and land has asked the local planning authorities in the outer metropolitan Area (O.M..A.) to release some 10 to 11 thousand acres in planning terms to support an increased private enterprise housing programme in the area, and it has been agreed between the Commissionand the Ministry of Housing that it would be appropriate for theCommission to acquire and dispose of &quot;between a third and a half ofthis land.   .11,   The priorities attached at the present time by the HousingDepartments to the various elements of their guidance to theCfuimission are in the following descending order(1)    land for early resale in the Outer Metropolitan andother &quot;pressure&quot; areas - the West Midlands, Horth-WesternRegion, and Scotland;(2)    land for early resale in other regions;     and(3)    &quot;white&quot;- land,  (viz. land for which planning permission isnot immediately available, and intended to be held by theCemmission for say 5 to 10 years).12,   The Commission has been concentrating on the pressure areas but their achievement has been hampered by the unwillingness of the planning authorities to release land in planning terms, particularlyin the West Midlands and the O.M.A., but in the other &quot;pressure&quot;areas and areas outside these areas the Commission has &quot;been more successful in finding land which appears to have good prospects for disposal.tt.  The Minister for Planning and Land has now had the response fromtoe planning authorities in the O.M.A. to his approach mentioned inParagraph 10 above.    The offers made by the planning authorities^ouat to only about half of what the Minister was seeking.   Of this/some
: some 1,000 to &quot;1,200 acres appear to the Commission suitable fori acquisition by them, either to ensure that they are developed still or that they are developed reasonably quickly without beinghoarded.    But to achieve the Minister&apos;s objectives it may benecessary for the Commission to attempt to bring more land on tothe market by finding land independently of the planning authoritiesand making it the subject of applications for planning permissionand draft compulsory purchase orders made at the same time.    Thesejould no doubt be opposed by the planning authorities and would have: to go to appeal.    The process, if started now, would probably bespread over 12 to 18 months before the Commission was able to acquireany land.    The extent to which the Commission could adopt thistactic depends on its resources, but it seems possible that someiialf dozen large sites could be obtained in the years 1970-71 and1571-72.    The Ministry and the Commission consider that a reasonable; estimate of acreage might be 1,000 acres; and they accordinglypropose that (taking account of the acreage of 1,000 to 1,200 thatsight be obtained with the agreement of the planning authorities)\ the Commission should make provision for the acquisition of aboutijOOO acres in the O.M.A. in 1970-71 and 1971-72, at a cost spreadover the Wo years of some  30 million, in addition to land in theI 1&apos;H.A. which the Commission is already in process of acquiring or^authorised to acquire.H. The programme of land acquisition envisaged by the land ^mission and the Housing ministry.es would therefore be asfollows: -/(table)

15,   The Treasury have not accepted the above programme.    The policyguidance given to the Commission by the Housing llin.ist.era.. does notnecessarily imply a programme at any particular level of net expenditure j and the Treasury consider that the Commissions programme should be determined,  like that of other spending Departments, by reference to internal priorities within, predetermined financiallimits, which should in turn be determined by reference to the priority attached by the Government to the objects of the Commission^expenditure relative to those of other programmes.16.  Some part of the programme for 1970-71 and 1971-72 representsexpenditure on schemes to which the Commission is already committed in the sense that formal steps towards acquisition have been takene,g. publication of draft C.P.O. &apos;s, preparation and exchange of contracts.   Much the greater part of the programme, however, relates to schemes of acquisition still in the earlier stages of consideration?and proposed additional acquisition of land in the CM,A. and land:&apos;or long term holding.17. Ministers will see that the programme proposed in paragraph 14is a reduction on the programme set out in SEP(69)9.    That paperdealt with expenditure up to 1970-71 and suggested expenditure of 33.7 million..and a borrowing equivalent of  24.6 million for thatyear,   The above programme allows for the slower build up which willie forced on the Commission by the lack of co-operation from localauthorities in the Outer Metropolitan Area and so for 1970-71 the 8*penditure is reduced by  6.0 million and the borrowing by*U million.Sales^* The Commission1s net expenditure on land is largely governed by^extent and speed of their land sales.    There is little experience10 show how quickly or otherwise the Commission can dispose of land.-^Commission regard &quot;land for early development&quot; as covering the./range
range between immediate disposal and holding the land for two or threeyears.    It may be necessary in some cases to hold land for thisperiod so that roads and sewers can be pat in or so that developmentof the land can be phased to take account of the programmes by localauthorities (e.g. schools).    The net expenditure proposed by theCommission (see the table in paragraph 14) is based on an assessment of likely future sales, most of which would fall within one to twoyears after acquisition.The borrowing requirement and borrowing limits19. The Commission^ borrowing needs related to the programmes inparagraph 14 v/ould imply approximately the following growth in thetotal of outstanding loansLoan debt outstanding  million at 31 March 1969 5.0At 31 March 1970 14.0At 31 March 1971 35.0At 31 March 1972 60.020.  Under the Land Commission Act there is a limit on the amount theCommission may borrow.    They may only exceed  45 million subject toa Ministerial Order which requires Treasury consent and an affirmations-tive resolution by the House of Commons; and there is a furtherHait of  75 million to exceed which legislation would be required.She above figures imply that the borrowing limit of  45 millionfloiud be exceeded during 1971-72; and it would be necessary toincrease the Commission&apos;s borrowing powers beyond  45 million by0rder during the 1970-71 Session and to consider at about the sameftae the need for legislation to increase the borrowing powersbeyond the  75 million limit which the Commission might be expectedto exceed during 1972-73.I /Public
pub lie expenditure and economic considerations21,   The figures of Land Commission expenditure used in this paperare shown gross of betterment levy.    That is, they are notionalfigures.    As explained above (paragraph 7)? when the Land Commissionbay land they deduct from the purchase price the amount of levywhich the seller would have had to pay on a private sale.   But inreckoning public expenditure this notional amount of levy is imputed.It is in accordance with the National Accounts and PESC conventions &apos;to show the figures in this way, because Government expenditure isshown at market prices (i.e. inclusive of taxes).&apos;.&apos;:&apos; ;     &apos; is! IfiSIf     V&quot;! pi&apos;; i . l. &apos;.&apos; ..      \      V22.   The PESC figures expressed in this way (i.e. gross of imputedbetterment levy) are the relevant ones for judging expenditure bythe Land Commission in relation to the Government&apos;s publishedexpenditure targets (Cmnd. 3936).23.   However, in considering the economic impact of the LandCommissions expenditure it is necessary to take into consideration the notional receipts from imputed levy as well as the grossexpenditure.    This is reflected in the Land Commission&apos;s borrowing requirement (see paragraph 7 above and the footnote to it).    the borrowing requirement represents, broadly speaking, the Commission^net purchase of assets.    When a public body buys an existing asset,such, as land, the immediate effect is to put money into the pocketPf the former owner of the asset.    Such an increase in the liquidity0I&quot; the private sector will not create an equivalent additional demand at once, though it will have an effect in due course.^Jjision&quot;H.  Ministers are asked to decide the scale of expenditure and the borrowing requirement of the Land Commission in 1970-71 and 1971-72.^e Ministry of Housing and Local Government, the Scottish Office andbhe Land Commission propose that these figures should be  million1970-71 1971-72Expenditure on land 27.7 33.8Borrowing requirement 20.3 25.3
