C(69) 89 COPY NO.21st July. 1969CABINETRESOURCES FOR TRANSFER TO NEW CIVIL research and development memorandum by the Lord President of the council at their meeting on the 12th May, the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy accepted savings on research anddevelopment (R and D) in defence, aerospace and civil nuclear technology,and at the same time asked for a statement of priorities in relation to the143 new civil R and D projects put forward by Departments to which someof the saved resources might be transferred.2,      Account will have been taken of the savings in deciding on the finalfigures for the reductions to be made in the budgets of the Ministry ofDefence and the Ministry of Technology for 1970-71 (as set out in Table iii of C(69) 82).3.      The attached note by the Chief Scientific Adviser to theGovernment, drawn up after extensive consultation with the central advisory Council for Science and Technology and subsequently with theOfficial Committee on Science and Technology, sets out a list of prioritiesfor the new civil R and D projects.    The list is in three parts j in 1970-71expenditure on the first would amount to  2. 55 million;  on the first and second together to  4.45 million; and on all three to  6,35 million.Conclusion and recommendation4.      I endorse the view of the Chief Scientific Adviser that the proposedcivil R and D projects should be supported.    It is highly desirable that weshould be seen to be transferring R and D resources from the defence fieldin particular to deprived and neglected civil fields which are in urgent need of R and D support.    Funds made available for such new R and D should beprovided on an earmarked basis.    Although I believe there is a strong case for supporting all or most of the proposed projects, in thecircumstances of the present review of public expenditure I am prepared to-1-COHFIDJENiTIAL
recommend only those of the very highest priority,    I therefore invite mycolleagues to agree to the transfer of resources sufficient to finance atleast the first group of projects as set out in Table A of the attached note,i.e.  2,55 million in 1970-71. rising to  3. 8 million in 1971-72 and to aplateau of  5. 0 million in 1972-73,T.F.P.Privy Council Office, S.W.I.18 th July, 1969-2-
-1-NATIONAL PRIORITIES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYPRIORITIES IN MEW CTVIL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENTNote &quot;by the Chief Scientific Adviser to the government at their meeting on 12th May (SEP(69) 12th Meeting, Minute 1), the ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy accepted basic proposalsfor a reduction of  14.5 million in 1972-73 in expenditure on research anddevelopment (R and D) in defence, aerospace and civil nuolear technology.At the same time they asked for a re-examination of possible savings inexcess of  14.5 million in 1972-73 on R and D in these fields;   and, inaccordance with their decision to transfer R and D resources from these to civil fields, they also a3ked for a statement of priorities in relation tothe 143 proposals for new civil R and D which had been brought forward by departments,2.     More precise figures for possible savings on R and D in defence,aerospace and civil nuclear technology have therefore been obtained for thethree years 1970-71, 1971-72 and 1972-73.    Although this exercise was begunbefore and pursued independently of the present review of public expenditure,account will have been taken of these savings in deciding on the finalfigures for the reductions to be made in the budgets of the Ministry ofDefence and the Ministry of Technology for 1970-71 (as set out in Table iii of 0(69) 82).3,     Since Ministers last considered the matter, there has also beenextensive interdepartmental consultation in order to prepare the statementof priorities for which Ministers asked.     The present paper is the result.It comes as a note from me as Chief Scientific Adviser to the Governmentrather than as a document formally agreed by Officials, not because theDepartments concerned dissent in any significant way from my recommendations,but because reaching them has meant the exclusion Of many of the 143 proposedprojects.     The total sought for new civil projepts rises from about
 11,7 million in 1970-71 to a plateau of about  22,25 million in1972-73.    The urgent question now is how much of the savings of 10.7- 12.0 million in 1970-71 can be allocated to new civil II and Dprojects for which no proposals have been included in Table III ofC(69) 82.     In the circumstances of the present review of publioexpenditure, I thought it best to choose first those projects ofobvious highest priority amounting in total to  2.55 million in1970-71 (rising to about  5 million in 1972-73);   then a secondtranche of  1.9 million in 1970-71 (rising to  2.6 million in 1972-73);and finally a third tranche of  1.2 million in 1970-71 (rising to 2,5 million in 1972-73).    Tranches 1 and 2 together amount to k-,k5 million in 1970-71* and tranches 1, 2 and 3 to  $n&amp;T million.The projects are listed in Table A which is divided into three parts:projects in the first tranche or part (&quot;Group 1&quot;) have higher prioritythan those in the second, and so on;   but there is no special orderwithin each group.     The corresponding demands for Civil service manpower v/ould he 196, 258 and 318,    A summary of the resourcesrequired hy Departments to carry out these projects in 1970-71, 1971-72and 1972-73 is given in Table B,    Unfortunately, a large number of goodproposals made hy Departments have had to be omitted from my lists.    if more money were available, it would be simple to set out a furtherchoice of projects from the departmental proposals,4.    In drawing up the lists of priorities which form the recommendationsof this report, full account has been taken of the views of the central advisory Council for Science and Technology as well as those of departments and of the Official Committee on Science and Technology.5.    The benefits expected from the projects can be of three rather different but interrelated kinds:   social, economic, and increased efficiency in the use of resources in the public sector.     individual projects are annotated accordingly in Table A.    It should he rememberedthat the results of the proposed R and D projects cannot in general beexpected to produce appreciable economic or social effects in the sectorsconcerned for at least two or three years.-2-
Balance, between Departments6.    In the list of projects, I have particularly favoured three areasin which there is heavy public expenditure (more than  1,000 million a year in each- oase), but in which relatively little R and D work iscarried out at present.     The areas (and Departments concerned) are:health (Department of Health and Social Security (DHSS) and scottish home and Health Department (SHHD));   transport (Ministry of Transport(MOT));   and building and construction (Ministry of Public building and Works (MPBW)).     I have also endorsed requests in a number ofother important fields in which Government R and D expenditure is relatively low:   watgj^and. waste disposal (Ministry of Housing andLocal G-overnment (MHLG-));   power and fuel policy (Central AssessmentUnit of Ministry of Power (MOP));   educational technology (Departmentof Education and Science (DES))j   and fire (operational research bythe Home Office),     In addition I have recommended support for somefisjaeries projects (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (RAFF)and Department of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland (DAFS)), anda number of the proposals of the Home Office regarding crime.7.     The Research Councils are relatively well provided for at present.However, I recommend that some of their projects, because of their particular importance, should be supported, including:   fan^effluentdisposal (Agricultural Research Council (ARC)), and the NaturalEnvironment Research Council^ proposals on marine science and technology and on ^aturaX resources.    Other proposals from the research Councils are also of importance, and it is hoped that fundscan be found before too long for this work from within the existingScience Vote, in spite of prior commitments.-3-
8*     AKriculture is also a very large scale activity, but Government R and Dexpenditure on it is already quite su/bstantial when the activities of theARC are included.     However, the agricultural Departments spend relatively little on R and D considering their responsibilities, and I therefore endorsesome of their projects which could have important economic benefits and whichare unlikely to be done      the ARC.9.     As a number of health projects submitted by the DHSS and the SHHD appearto cover similar ground, it is suggested that these two Departments shouldconstilt one another before resources for these projects are finallyearmarked (see below).Earmarking of resources for new work i10.    The current review- of public expenditure is expected to result in cutsin departmental budgets, and these may load to consequential reductions in existing programmes of R and D - although it Is to be hoped that this lattereventuality may be avoided in the case of those Departments whose current expenditure on R and D is relatively small.     However, any reductions in theG-rants-in-Aid to the Research Councils (i.e. in the Science Budget) would necessarily imply the abandonment of items in their current programmes ofR and D.     Departments obliged to reduce their existing R and D in this waymight seek to use any new R and D resources available for redeployment to restore what would otherwise be lost through cuts in public expenditure,rather than to embark on new programmes.    As this might he regarded asforestalling the transfer of resources to meritorious new programmes ofR and D, I propose that all funds allocated in the present exercise shouldbe earmarked for the new projects that are endorsed here.     Any Departmentwhich was granted new resources on this basis should decline the offer ifthey were to feel that the new programmes were dependent on existing programmes which had had to be abandoned as a result of cuts in public expenditure.     When Ministers have decided the amount of resources that can-4-
be made available for new R and D, some detailed readjustment of thedepartmental programmes should therefore he allowed, after due consultationwith ne as Chairman of the Official Committee on Science and Technology,and after the usual bilateral discussions between each Department and theTreasury that would-in any case follow Ministerial allocation of resources.When this had been completed, -fee funds should thereafter be earmarked forthe approved projects.Recommendsti on11 .   In the light of this note and the information sot out in Tables A and EMinisters are invited to decide what sum they are willing to transfer to newcivil R and D in 1970-71  (and consequentially in 1971-72 and 1972-73).I will then arrange, in consultation with the Treasury and the Departmentsconcerned, for whatever sum is agreed by Ministers to he allocated among the projects of the highest priority.(Signed)       S.
