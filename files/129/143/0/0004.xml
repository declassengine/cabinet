C(69) 7914th July, 1969CABINETTHE LANCASHIRE TEXTILE industry memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeIntroductionWe have to take certain decisions of policy concerning theLancashire textile industry.General background,      The background is that, in 1966, the Textile Council - v/hich isthe statutory Development Council for the cotton, silk and man-madefibre industries - was asked by the Board of Trade to carry out a studyon ways and means of increasing the productivity and efficiency of theLancashire industry.    The CounciPs Report was published on31st March.    It has generally been acclaimed as authoritative andcourageous in its approach to the industryTs deep seated problems.The Textile CounciPs recommendations.      The Council made a number of far-reaching recommendations for action by both the industry itself and the Government.    These are set out fully in Annex 1.    I am discussing with the Council therecommendations concerning the industry; here I am concerned withthe recommendations requiring action by the Government.    These arenotablyt-(i) that from 1st January, 1972, the present system of quotas shouldbe abolished for all countries, with the exception of theCommunist bloc, and should be replaced by a tariff on importsof cotton textiles from the Commonwealth at die most favoured nation (m. .n.) rate or, if this would assist negotiation, at85 per cent of this rate (i. e. a tariff of broadly 6-g per cent onyarn, 15 per cent on cloth - which is the crucial part of the fieldv/e are discussing - and 17 per cent on garments; imports fromthe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and the irish republic would remain duty free); and-1-COPY NO.DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)
(ii) that the development area rate of grant should be available for alimited period to the industry in the traditional textile areas.The Industrial Background4.      The Lancashire textile industry covers?-(i) the spinning, weaving and finishing of cotton; of short-stapleman-made fibres; and of mixtures of these two;(ii) the weaving and finishing of man-made continuous filament yarns.The spinning and weaving of cotton has been in almost continuous declinefor fifty years, first because of the loss of export markets, later becauseof the rapid growth of duty-free imports from the Commonwealth, andmost recently because of competition from woven made-made fibres andknitted products, whose share of the market rose from 15 per cent to30 per cent between 1958 and 1968 and is expected to rise to 43 per cent by 1975.    Annex 2 shows that the production of spun and filament clothfell from 2,225 million 3 qua re yards in 1958 (the year preceding theCotton Industry Act, 1959) to 1,445 million square yards in 1968; withinthe total, the production of cotton cloth fell by half     The TextileCouncils forecast is that, even if the import-export balance improvesby 200 million square yards, production of spun and filament cloth willremain at about this level between now and 1975, but that the share ofcotton within the total will continue to decline,5.      Employment in the industry, which fell by 115,000 between 1958and 1968, is expected to fall by at least a further 55,000 in the next six years; that is, there will have been a decline over the whole period from 240, 000 to 70, 000.    The number Of mills, which  ell by more than half between 1958 and 1968, will fall by a further two-thirds if labourand machine productivity increase as rapidly as expected.6.      The decline in production has been accompanied by a sharpincrease in imports of cotton and man-made fibre cloth and cottonmade-ups - from an estimated 500 million square yards.in 1958 to1,114 million square yards in 1968,    Annex 3 shows that the share of themarket taken by imports of cotton cloth and made-ups in I960 - theearliest year for which comparable figures are available - was 34 per centoverall, but that by 1968 this had risen to 53 per cent.    The share takenby imports from the developing countries increased over the period from24 per cent to 34 per cent; but since 1964, when the share of imports inthe market has risen particulax-ly rapidly, there has been a sharpincrease in imports from the developed countries, and these countriesnow account for rather more than one-quarter of the total imports(Canada and the Irish Republic being the largest suppliers).    No lessthan 78 per cent of imports are admitted duty-free:  63 per cent fromthe Commonwealth and 15 per cent from Finland and EFTA (FINEFTA)and the Irish Republic.
7. There have been, considerable changes In the industry in the pastt&amp;ti&apos; years.    The number of independent firms has fallen by nearly half,and the big groups now control nearly half the output.    Although a gooddeal more investment is required to bring it up to continents.! standards of efficiency, the industry is now in a stronger competitive position thanit was a few years ago as a result of the considerable sums which havebeen spent on modernisation.    Production and marketing methods havealso been streamlined.    These improvements have convinced the textile Council that the industry can compete effectively behind a15 per cent tariff.    This would have been inconceivable four years ago.The Present Tariff Position8,      There are at present no duties on imports of textil.es and clothing from the Commonwealth (unless they contain silk and man-madefibres, in which case the duty is 85 per cent of the correspondingm,f,n. rate).    The m.f.n. rate is broadly lj per cent on yarn,17f per cent on cloth and 20 per cent on made-ups.    The TextileCounciPs proposal is that the rate on cotton textiles imported from theCommonwealth should be the same as the m.f, n. rate or, if this would assist negotiation, 85 per cent of the m.f.n. rate.    The lov/er figure would give the Commonwealth the same preference for cotton as forman-made fibre products.Other countries Tariffs9,       Annex 4 shows in simplified form what rates of duty will becharged on cotton textiles by other developed countries on 1st January,1972, the date on which both the tariff proposed by the Textile Counciland the full Kennedy Round tariff reductions are due to take effect.It shows that the proposed United Kingdom tariff would be:-(a) almost identical with that of the European Economic Community(e.c.)l(b) a little higher than the USA;(c) lower than Canada, particularly on garmeaiEs;&quot;(d) lower than Japan on garments, but substantially higher on cloth?(e) lower than most of the Scandinavians on garments and higherthan most of them on yarn and cloth.But in most cases the difference is not so great as to be significant, andin the case of garments what we are proposing is certainly modest by comparison with other countries.-3-
The Present Quota Position10.      Following limited arrangements to control imports m previous years, my predecessor introduced a comprehensive schema of quotacontrol on 1st January, 1966, to restrict imports into the United kingdom for a period of-five years;  only a handful of developed countries in western Europe, North America and Australasia were exempted fromthe scheme.    Imports in 1966 were restricted to the 1962-64 averageand were subsequently allowed to grow by only 1 per cent per annum upto the end of 1970.    India and Hong Kong each have a country quota ofabout 200 million square yards.    All the other countries (except japan and the Communist bloc, where trade continues to be regulated underbilateral agreements) share in a so-called global quota of 136 million square yards, half of which is allocated to and administered by thecountries concerned on the basis of their past trade.    The other half is pooled and allocated to the United Kingdom ?.mporters.    A more detailed description of the quota scheme is to be found at Annex 5.Other Countries^ Quotas11.       Most industrial countries, in addition to their tariffs described above, impose quantitative restrictions on certain imports of cotton textiles in accordance with the GATT Long Term Agreement.    Thus:-(i) the USA restricts imports of most types of cotton textiles from a wide range of developing countries.    The effect has been to limit imports to about 10 per cent of domestic consumption.(&quot;) Canada, which has the advantage of a relatively high tariff onyarn and cloth, imposes restrictions mainly on garments.(iii) Imports from the developing countries into the European -economic community amount to only 8 per cent of domestic consumption,though restrictions apply to only a handful of countries,(iv) The Scandinavian countries do not, as a rule, restrict imports ofyarn and cloth, which they apparently regard as raw material,but recently they have begun to impose restrictions on importsof garments from a number of low-cost suppliers.The Import Problem and its Solution12.      We hctve to decide whether the industry is to be given continuedprotection when the present arrangements end on 31st December, 1970;and if so, what form that protection should take.    It may be assumed that the importing countries will secure the extension of the GATTCotton Textile Agreement after September, 1970 for a further period,and will thus have available to them a substantial measure of quotaprotection in addition to their tariffs.    In these circumstances it wouldbe politically impossible to leave our own industry to fend for itselfwithout effective protection.    In my view, this protection should take theform of a tariff on the lines of paragraph 3(i) above.-4-
Merits of the Tariff Solution13.       The arguments for the tariff solution are as follows 3-(a) The stimulus to efficiency within the industry wou&apos;    be greaterunder the tariff, because:-(i)  the industry would know more clearly where it stood,since the margin of protection under a tariff is bothstable and predictable.    As consumption declines,quotas on the other hand become decreacingly effective,confidence would thus be restored in a way which hasnot been and would not be possible under quotas, andthe investment required to make the industry competitivewould be correspondingly stimulated;(ii)  there would be increased pressure on the less efficientunits to close down since it is in these sections that imports would be concentrated;  conversely, production would be concentrated in sectors where we are relativelymore efficient.(b) The proposed tariff would be broadly the same as that existing in most other developed countries.    Moreover a decision to rely solely on a moderate tariff for protection would be in markedcontrast to the attitude adopted by Mr. Stans, the United states secretary of Commerce, who has been trying to persuade othercountries to limit their exports to the United States;  it shouldalso encourage the liberal elements in the e.c. and Scandinaviato resist growing protectionist pressures in the textile field.(c) It is estimated that the additional revenue from the tariff would amount to at least  10 million per annum.    This figure takesinto account probable changes in the composition and pattern ofimports as well as an overall reduction in volume;  though of course the less effective the tariff in reducing imports, thegreater the revenue from it.    Since I am proposing, however,that compensatory aid of between  4 million and  5 million should be made available to India to offset her loss of tradeunder a tariff, the gain to the Revenue would be offset by this amount.(d) The gain to the balance of trade in cotton textiles is estimated ata minimum of  12 million per annum.    This estimate takes no account of improved efficiency by the industry as the result ofa change to a tariff, although we expect such an improvement,nor of any Indirect effect in our export markets, the likelihood of which I discuss later, nor of the additional aid to India whichI have just mentioned.    It also assumes that the quotas, if-5-
retained, would be enlarged as before by 1 per cent per annum,and that prices would not be higher under a quota than theywould be under the tariff.    This has not, in fact, been theexperience to date we know from the price at which licenceschange hands in the exporting countries that the quotas have enabled the developing countries to charge a premium on sales to the United Kingdom well in excess of the proposed tariff.It follows(i)  that the tariff should not raise prices to the consumer;(ii)  that the landed price before payment of duty should fall bythe full amount of the duty; and(iii) that the gain to the balance of trade should be at least as high as the gain to the Revenue.    In fact, it Is put at 2 million higher because of the expected change in thevolume and composition of imports as a result of thechangeover to a tariff.(e) We should avoid the constant recrimination both with our own industry and with other countries which would ensue if we continued the present quotas for another three to five years.We should also avoid the bad blood which would follow anyattempt on our part to reduce the quotas in line with the fallin consumption, an attempt which might well be forced on us bydomestic pressures in the next recession.    I enlarge on thispoint later.(f) Support for the tariff comes not only from the Textile Council,which spent three years studying the various alternatives, butalso from the textile Trade Unions and the Members ofParliament representing the textile areas.    We are thuspresented with a change to settle, on a long-term basis, a problem which has been a nightmare to successive governments and by agreeing to the industry&apos;s own proposal we would greatlystrengthen the Governments bargaining position, and its powerto withstand the textile lobby, if the tariff proved in practiceless effective than we hope.Disadvantages of a Tariff14.      There are on the other hand international difficulties in theproposal for a tariff.    Although they overlap to a considerable extent,these difficulties can be considered under three broad headings:-(i) the effect on the Commonwealth;(ii) the effect on Developing Countries; and(iii) the complications arising out of our application to join the e.c..-6-GONPiESSENTIAL
Effect on tho Commonwea 1 th15.      India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa havecontractual rights to duty-free entry, and co in effect has Pakistan.    Indiaalso has guaranteed margins of preference on some important typos ofcotton textiles.    We should be In breach of our trade agreements withthese countries if we were unilaterally to impose a tariff on their exportsof cotton textiles to us.    It would be necessary, therefore, to enter into negotiations with each of them with a view to persuading them to waivetheir rights to duty-free entry on cotton textiles.    If we failed, wo shouldhave to consider whether it was in our interests to denounce tho wholeagreement with that country.K wc were able to obtain a waiver of their fights from thoctecountries, it might cost us something, probably in the form of a more rapid removal of some of the preferences which we enjey in their markets.But this would not necessarily happen at once, nor should It bo on aconsiderable scale,(i)  Our imports of cotton textiles from Australia, New Zealand andSouth Africa are trivial ( 41, 000,  15, 000 and  169, 000respectively in 1968).    These countries could only use our action as one more reason for saying that the balance of theTrade Agreements was becoming tilted against them andjustified them in whittling away our preferences or other rights under the Agreements when it suited them to do so.(ii)  Our tariff preferences in India are not of great practical valueat the moment because Indians purchases of British goods arclargely determined by the import licences which she can afford to issue.   Even 3D: India suppressed some of our preferences,therefore, the effect on our trade would not be significant.In any case, if we gave India more aid as I propose, v/e should expect her to maintain our preferences.(iii) Pakistan should gain on balance from the abolition of quota restrictions and we might hope to keep our preferencessubstantially intact.(iv) Canada would lose most of her exports of cotton textiles to us,which in 1968 were worth  6 million.    She has, however, afavourable balance on her total trade with us of some 250 million per annum.    She would certainly react sharplyto the imposition of a tariff, but I think it unlikely diat she would retaliate by immediately withdrawing preferences which she gives us.    She would rather dispose of our preferences as and when we was able to obtain in return, e.g. from the USAand Japan, concessions that would benefit Canadian trade; andv/e should find her even less willing than hitherto to listen to our representations.-7-
(v)  Other countries in the Commonwealth have no contractualrights to duty-free entry; though some of them, e. g, Jamaica,Malta and Singapore, give non-contractual preferences toBritish exports.    Some of these preferences might be put at risk, though it seems unlikely since these particular countries, stand to gain on balance in their trade in cotton textiles from the removal of quotas.16.     In short, therefore, I should expect little if any immediateretaliation against our preferences in Commonwealth Markets, buta greater readiness than would otherwise have been the case toreduce or remove them whenever it suited the countries concerned todo so in the future.    This would be most serious in Canada.    there might thus, over a period of years, be some loss of exports (and of export profitability) to set against the advantage to our balance oftrade in textiles of  12 million; the loss cannot be quantified, but itwould probably not be great.17.     Moreover it has to be remembered that a loss of this kindmight be incurred even if we sought to continue the quota system -and in that case there would be no  12 million gain to set it against.For it is most unlikely that, in practice, we should be able to maintainthe quotas as Jheyjjare^jiow.     A year ago a great deal of bitterness was created in Hong Kong and India because we tightened up the restrictionson imports of wide sheeting and sheets.    Now we are under pressure from the industry to do the same on towels and towelling.     In the nexttextile recession, which may be expected in 1970, the Governmentwill come under severe pressure from the industry to reduce the quotasand increase categorisation, a move which would be bitterly resisted bythe supplying countries and would carry some risk of retaliatione. g, from Pakistan and Singapore.     Moreover, if the quotas were tobe extended after 1970 a number of countries, e. g. Israel, Spain andMexico, would claim that the restrictions should not be applied tothem.    Some of these countries came very close to retaliating against our exports in 1965-66, when the quotas were imposed, and theymight well decide to do so if what we originally described as a &quot;breathingspace11 were to be extended for a further period.    It is thus clear thata continuation of the quotas could lead to as much international friction and risk of retaliation as the imposition of a tariff.18.     To revort to the Commonwealth, the adoption of the tariffsolution - the first breach by the United Kingdom in the system of commonwealth free entry for more than a generation - might be taken as a sign that we v/ere writing off the Commonwealth preference systemeven in advance of our possible entry into the e.c., and some commonwealth countries might draw the conclusion that it would paythem to trade away the advantages accorded to British goods in theirmarkets at the earliest opportunity.    I doubt if in practice we needgive much weight to this factor.     Most Commonwealth countriesalready accept that one of the consequences of our entry into the EECwould be the termination of preferential treatment of their exports toour market, and they have drawn their own conclusions.    They would hardly be surprised to find us drawing similar conclusions,-8-
19.     The second set of international considerations concerns the developing countries.    The question is, would these countries lose orgain from the adoption of the tariff solution?    The answer is clear inrespect of developing countries outside the Commonwealth - they would all obviously gain.    Their exports of cotton textiles to us would nolonger be limited by quota, and they would pay only the same tariff as before,20.     Developing Commonwealth countries need to be consideredindividually.    Hong Kong would be unlikely to suffer damage; any loss in the value of her exports of cotton yarn and cloth would probably be offset by increased exports of garments which would no longer belimited by quota.    By her pef orrnance under the existing global quota,Pakistan haa shown that she is extremely competitive;   in terms ofvolume of trade, she would probably gain more from the removal ofquotas than she would lose by the imposition of a tariff,21.     The other significant exporters of cotton textiles amongCommonwealth develcping countries are Singapore, Malta and Jamaica,with exports in 1968 worth  900,000,  686,000 and  329,000respectively.    There is a good chance that Singapore and Malta  wouldbe successful in increasing their trade if it were no longer restricted by quota.    Jamaica!s prospects are more uncertain, but the value ofher cotton textile exports is insignificant compared with the value of her exports of primary foodstuffs.22.     This leaves India.    The effect of the bilateral quota of200 million sq. yds, for India has been to protect her from competition from other developing countries, particularly Pakistan.     Theimposition of a tariff, accompanied by the abolition of quotas, would belikely to damage Indian trade, because it would reduce her profit margins as well as the quantity which she would be able to sell in theUnited Kingdom market.    But even if the present quota arrangements were continued, India&apos;s exports ( 18 million in 1968) might easily fallas they did in 1966 and 1967 - because   3he was unable to fulfil thewhole of her quota.    It is obviously difficult to assess in advance how much India would lose from the combination of the ending of the bilateral quotas and the imposition of the tariff.    I do not believe that india has any right to compensation for the abolition of the bilateralquota, but I think it would be right to offset through additional aid that part of her potential loss of trade arising from the loss of her presentduty-free entry rights.    The best estimate I have been able to make isthat this part of the loss would be of the order of 5 0 million sq. yds, ,amounting to a loss of foreign earnings of the order of  4 -  5 million.I propose, therefore, that our negotiators should be authorised to offerIndia additional aid over a period of five years to a total value of 20 million.    I believe that this offer can be presented in such a way asto avoid creating a precedent which other developing countries,particularly in the Commonwealth, might invoke against us in the future,-9-
23.     In summary, the introduction of a tariff should not be to the disadvantage of developing countries as a whole.    Many of them wouldbe likely to gain rather than lose.    Broadly, I would expect that otherdeveloping countries will gain roughly the trade which India can expect to lose, and that by 1975 the volume of imports from developing countries as a whole will be at about the present level or onlymarginally below it.    The gain to Lancashire will be predominantlyat the expense of the developed countries such as Canada, whose trade has increased rapidly as a result of the quota restrictions imposed onthe developing countries.    These facts, and the offer of additional aid to India, should help us both in UNCTAD and in GATT, though I do not doubt  that some rough words will be spoken.e.c. Aspects24.     The third set of international problems arises out of our application to join the e.c..    The adoption of the tariff solution would of course have the important general advantage that we should havevirtually harmonised our tariff with the common external tariff on cotton textiles.    But there are three apparent diff difficulties:-(i)      It seems certain that the LTA will be extended after it expires next year and that the Community will be operating quotas against low-cost suppliers onmost, but not all, kinds of cotton textiles.    Thequestion will be whether they insist on the re-imposition of quotas by the United Kingdom in suchcases in order to conform to the situation in theCommunity; for if we have no quotas, and cotton textiles, having paid the common external tariff,are allowed to circulate freely within the enlarged community, imports into Britain would undermine the Community restrictions.   But the fact is that this difficulty will arise in any event and will require asolution, since the Six would regard our existingquotas as much too large.    Whether or not we already have a tariff on Commonwealth importswill not significantly affect the argument.(ii)      By the time we join, the Six may be operating duty-freequotas for cotton textiles from developing countriesin accordance with an UNCTAD scheme for   generalpreferences.    We should no doubt be required tofollow suit; and this would entail going back, to alimited extent, on the tariff solution.    It is farfrom certain, however, that the e.c. will maintain their offer to UNCTAD of duty-free quotas; even ifthey do so, it would have to be worked out in thenegotiations that would in any case be necessaryfor fitting our cotton textile arrangements into theirs.
(iii)      There is the problem of the provisional agreement reached in 1962 designed to safeguard the trading interests of Commonwealth developing countriesin the Far East (Ceylon,   India and Pakistan).In 1967, Mr, George Brown told the WEU that he hoped the 1962 Agreement could be revived.    Inpractice, the situation has changed so much since1962 that it would be virtually impossible toresuscitate the provisional agreement in anything like its existing form.    In late 1967, it was agreedinterdepartmentally and at a meeting with theGovernor of Hong Kong that it would be neitherin the interests of the United Kingdom nor of hong Kong to claim any exception for cotton textiles.I do not see that we can or ought to be inhibited byprovisional arrangements entered into so long ago.25.     While I recognise, therefore, that the possibility of Britishaccession to the Community somewhat complicates the picture,these uncertainties should not divert us from acting in accordancewith our national interests.   Certainly the textile industry wouldbitterly, and in my view reasonably, resent it if we rejected theirpreferred solution, or gave them no clear indication of policy,because of complications which might or might not arise if and when our application to join the e.c. succeeds.    I should, however, makeit clear in announcing our policy that it would be subject to any modifications that might be required as a result of entry into the eec either before or after it came into effect,.-11-
General Comment on International Difficulties26.      I have, in fairness to my colleagues, described at some lengththe international complications which might follow the adoption of thetariff solution.    But I must reiterate that equal complications would follow the rejection of this solution.    For if v/e turn down the TextileCouncils tariff recommentation, pressure is bound to mount eitherfoic a substantial reduction in the quotas, or for the setting up of aregulating Commission on the lines put forward by the parliamentary labour Party jointly with the unions in 1955, endorsed by the PrimeMinister in 1957 and - in a modified form - by Mr. George Brov/n inJuly, 1963.    However, the Prime Minister&apos;s support for the latterproposal was limited to the situation which would have arisen if agreement had not been reached with India on a voluntary restraint,and Mr. George 3rown&apos;s modification of it was also overtaken by events;in any case it is difficult to see how a Buying Commission could beestablished consistently with Article 111(4) of the GATT, which prohibitsthe setting up of a State monopoly to increase the protection afforded tothe domestic industry.    As to a reduction in the quotas, this would be contrary to the Long-Term Arrangement and would have the disagreeableinternational consequences described in earlier paragraphs.    one cannot, therefore, evade the international difficulties by rejecting the tariff solution;  a continuation of the quotas would lead to comparabledifficulties *- unless, of course, we were prepared to let the industry godown the drain.Financial Assistance for the Industry27.      I consider that the industry have made out a strong case, by theirown lights, for some financial assistance from the Government, not onlyon structural grounds, but also because of the lack of confidence in thefuture prospects of the industry among the lending community.28.      Nevertheless, I have concluded (and my colleagues in theIndustrial Policy Committee have agreed) that it would not be possiblein present circumstances, including in particular the position on public expenditure, to justify giving the industry more money for re-equipment.I ruled out ab initio the Textile Council&apos;s specific proposal that theDevelopment Area rates of grant should be made available to theLancashire industry generally, since this would be contrary to ourregional policies.    But I also concluded that other methods of assistance,for example by way of loans, would be equally unjustifiable at the presenttime, the more so as the beneficiaries would include a number of largefirms who should be able to find money for re-equipment from their own resources.29.      The medium and small-sized firms will be the most affected bya decision not to give the industry financial help with re-equipment.    TheIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation - who are working closely withthe two consultants I have appointed and with the Board of Trade - may-12-
be able to help where mergers are concerned, and I hope in consultationwith the Department of Economic Affairs to persuade them to use their powers to the full to help the industry.    I attach much importance to this.30,      There remains a supplementary proposal by the Textile council that plant worked on a multi-shift basis should qualify for an annualallowance for tax purposes of 25 per cent, and in certain instances30 per cent, instead of the present 20 per cent.    Since one of the firstessentials for greater competitiveness in the industry is that machinery should be more intensively utilised, I attach considerable importance tothis concession.Summary of Conclusions31,      Despite the complications of a tariff, I believe that this is theright solution.    Successive Governments have failed to solve theproblem of the -Lancashire textile industry.    While the industry isitself much to blame for its own predicament, blame also rests withthe failure to deal adequately with the fundamental question of cheapduty-free imports from the Commonwealth, which have led to a greaterdegree of import penetration than in any other major industry in thiscountry and than in the textile industry of any other developed country.The quotas, which were originally conceived as a temporary measure to give the industry a breathing-space to reorganise and re-equip, have failed to give the industry the confidence it needs to make itselfcompetitive.32.      The industry itself, through the Textile Council, has now come down in favour of protection by a modest tariff, without quotas.This is a courageous decision and a departure from the old protectionism.It should put pressure on the weak and inefficient units to leave theindustry and encourage the efficient to invest in the new plant and machinery essential to their competitiveness,33,      The introduction of a tariff will not only give a basis of stable and certain protection in line with that enjoyed by textile industries inmost other countries.    It will also demonstrate that this Governmentcares about the industry sufficiently to make a major change in commercial policy on its behalf.     Psychologically, the effect ofthis on confidence cannot be over-estimated.34.      While I appreciate the international complications of the course proposed, they should not be exaggerated.    Every country in the worldregards cotton textiles as a problem industry in need of special measures,and the exposure of the United Kingdom market to duty-free importsfrom the Common wealth has long been regarded by other importing countries as wholly exceptional;  the imposition of a tariff, therefore,could be presented as an exceptional measure related to cotton textilesalone.    Moreover, it would not, as I have demonstrated, be all loss tothe Commonwealth;  and in the particular case of India I have proposed-13-CONFIDENTSAL
that there should be compensatory aid.    Against this, there shouldbe advantage to the balance of payments (and to the revenue) ascompared with continuation of the quotas - largely at the expense ofdeveloped rather than developing countries.35.     The only alternative to a tariff is the continuation of the quotas in some form.   I have already indicated the serious drawbacksto this course.     Most important, it would, I believe, largely destroy the opportunity to put the industry oh a sound footing; and indeed itcould scarcely, in the absence of any financial assistance, beconstrued as a &quot;policy&quot; for the industry.    Certainly the TextileCouncil would claim, with justice, that they had wasted three yearsof effort in the production cf their Report.Recommendation36.    I therefore recommend that our policy should be to replace the quotas by a tariff of the order indicated in paragraph 3(i) from 1st January, 1972.    J  such a tariff were adopted, quotas on individual categories of cotton textiles from particular sourcescould be re-imposed only in proved cases of market disruption;the Textile Council accept this.    The period between the ending ofthe present quota arrangements in 1970 and the coming into force ofthe tariff would be covered by an extension of the quota arrangementsfor a further twelve months.    This should occasion no difficulty.37. I also recommend that compensatory aid should be availablefor India to a total value of  20 million over a period of five years,38.     As far as financial assistance is concerned, I recommendthat no special grants or loans should be made to the industry, butthat we should consider sympathetically a formal application foraccelerated depreciation allowances.Announcement of a Decision39.     If my colleagues agree with my recommendations, I would wish to make an early announcement.    This would need to be interms which were sufficiently firm to satisfy the industry of our intentions, but sufficiently flexible to recognise that we have tonegotiate freedom from our Agreements with commonwealth governments before we can give effect to them.C, A.

Annex 1THE TEXTILE COUNCIL&apos;S PROPOSALSp-rmxisals for Action by GovernmentThe Council made four proposals for action by Government,  that it should:(i)   introduce a tariff on Commonwealth cotton textiles;(ii)    prevent a disruptive rise in imports while the industry is adjustingitself to reliance on tariff protection alone;(iii)    take swifter and more effective action to stop dumping and othermalpractices which result in distortion of trade;(iv)    encourage re-equipment in the traditional   textile areas by offeringthe incentive of investment grants no less favourable than thoseavailable in Development Areas.Proposals for Action by the industry,     The Council made three main recommendations to the industry as follows:Jit should:(i)    j ncrecise the rate of re-equipment on the basis of the estimated futuremar ke t demand;(li)   move rapidly towards mulLi-shift systems of working and associatedhigher wage structures;(iii)   develop closer technical and commercial links between the various stages of production and marketing by integration of activities wi. thin existinggroups and by forming new integrated groups and consortia from amongexisting medium-sized and smaller firms.However, the Council considered that these proposals,  taken in conjunction to those for Government action, would not entirely solve the industry&apos;s problems and so itsuggested that the industry must:(iv)   rationalise production so as to achieve longer runs of bulk lines;(v)   extend the use of work study, management training and other aids tothe effective utilisation of manpower and equipment;(vi )    place greater emphasis on design, market research and the training ofmar ke t i ng s t aff;(vi i )    Create condition1; which will attract  the quality of men and womennecessary  in a modern capital intensive industry.
Arinex 2The Lancashire Textile Industry:    Trends in Demand and ProductionIn the last 10 years there has been a major shift in the pattern of consumptionaway from conventional fabrics produced on the Lancashire system into warp-knitting,veft knitting,  and other systems of cloth production.    In 1958 spun/woven fabricssupplied 66 per cent of United Kingdom consumption;    by 1968 the figure had fallen to 50 per cent and the Textile Council has forecast that there will be a drop tosome 37 per cent by 1975.    At the same time knitted and non-conventionally formed-fabrics rose from 15 per cent of total    consumption in 1958 to 30 per cent in 1968and the forecast is for an increase to 43 per cent by 1975.If,    The effect on production, employment, etc. on the Lancashire industry has beenllarked.    The Textile Council&apos;s Study shows that the downward trend is likely tocontinue, in spite of an improvement of 200 million sq. yds.   (i.e.  22 per cent)in   the foreign trade balance in spun/woven fabrics which the authors of the Studyassumed could be achieved by 1975.    The trends are as follows:Production 1958 1965 1968 1970 1975[forecast)Spun yarn (m. lbs.) ......              771 630 550 538 550Filament yarn (m.  lbs.) ..              191 396 533Woven cloth:ISpun and mixture m.sq.yds. 1961 1407 1075 1040 1030(of which cotton m.sq.yds.)

The Study gives a demand estimate for Lancashire spun yarn in 1975 of480 m.lb. (excluding waste spinning).    The authors suggested that, if the projectedincrease in efficiency is achieved,  this amount of yarn could be produced in 1975by 65 mills (compared to the present 133) operating 1.7 m.  spindles working 112 hour;a week.    The weaving estimate of 1480 m.sq.yds.  could similarly be produced by43,000modern looms operating an average of two-and-a-half shifts/day, giving apossible 90-100 weaving units:    there are now some 425 units:    and the present 139finishing units could fall to 50 or 60 (excluding screen printing).spinning, weaving and finishing activities are currently shared between 350separate companies.    The forecast, on the above assumptions about capacity, is thatbV 1975 the number of firms will fall to only    100.

Annex *t*Restriction&apos;-, on Imports of CottonTextile:; into the United KingdomThis note describes the present arrangements and the essential background.The inter-industry agreementsi%,    In 1959/60 the Lancashire industry, with Government encouragement enterediinto negotiation with their counterparts in India and Hong King and agreed onrestraint arrangements to be operated by the exporting country.    Similar agreementsffollowed with Pakistan and a number of other countries which emerged as major]SUppliers during the early 1960&apos;s.    There was little detailed categorisation of the[quotas.iThe five year restriction scheme 1966-70[3.     This did not halt the flood of cotton textiles as more and more countries(entered the United Kingdom market.    H.M.G.  therefore decided in 1965 that importsifrom all countries,    with the exception of the developed countries of western europe, North America and Australasia,  should be restricted for a period of fiveyears.    These restrictions, which are more extensive in coverage and more detailedj in categorisation than those operated by any other country except the U.S.A.,cover all yarn, woven grey and finished cloth and made-ups containing 50 per centor more by weight of cotton.    Knitted cotton cloth and made-ups were not restricted.The quotas,  which were based on average imports in the three year:&apos;. 1902-64,represented a cut-back of more than 10 per cent on the 1964 level of trade.    Theannual increase is limited to 1  per cent.4.    The arrangements for the various countries are as follows:-India has a country quota for approx.  12m.  lbs. of yarn and 201 m.  sq. yds.of cloth and made-ups. The quota is divided into twenty categories with ameasure of flexibility between them.Hong Kong also has a country quota of approx.  6 m. lbs. of yarn and193 m.  sq. yds.  of cloth and made-ups.    In this case there are twenty-fivecategories and less flexibility than in the case of India.The Global Quota applies to &apos;imports from all the other low-cost suppliers,including such countries as Spain, Yugoslavia, Greece, Israel, Malta and gibraltar.    The quota amounts to approx.  9 m.  lbs. of yarn and 136 m.   sq.yds. of cloth and made-ups.    There are twenty-two parts.    Approximatelyhalf is allocated to United Kingdom importers, who can use their licences to buy from any of the global quota countries.    Most of the trade has gone to Pakistan.    The rest is divided amongst the countries concerned on thebasis of their past performance.With the sole exception of the licences issued to United Kingdom importersunder the global qyota - accounting for less than one-seventh of the trade -the administration of the quotas is in the hands of the exporting countries.5.     Our trade agreements with Japan,  the Eastern krea countries and China includequotas for cotton   textiles, mainly expressed in value terms;   they total ratherunder f.;j m.    There is very little categorisation.1
11, The Irish Republic has also agreed to restrict exports to the United Kingdomof (i) yarn, and (ii) goods manufactured in the Irish Republic from yarn or clothImported from low-cost countries.Portugal secretly agreed to restrict exports to the United Kingdom in the-spring of 1967.    The agreement was denounced last December, following the introductionof the. Import Deposit Scheme, but we understand that  the  trade is still underk control and is currently within the ceilings formerly agreed.Importduties on cotton textilesft.    Broadly speaking, the duties on textiles entirely of cotton are:-Cotton yarnCotton cloth, woven\ and knittedCotton garmentsM.f.n.  ratelit17-?%various rates,around 20%Commonwealth,  irish republic and E.F.T.A.NilNilNilJA higher rate of duty is applicable to goods containing 5 per cent or more of silklor man-made fibre;    and in this case imports from the Commonwealth (but not fromE.F.T.A. or the Irish Republic) are subject to about 85 per cent of the full rate.This means that goods imported from the Commonwealth which contain 50 per cent ormore of cotton and 5 per cent or more of man-made fibre or silk are subject to a tariff as well as to the quota.    The trade, if it exists, is insignificant.    Mostblends contain at least 50 per cent of m.m.f. and of course it is only too easyI to increase the minimum from 50 to, say, 55 per cent to escape the control.    and commonwealth suppliers have no incentive to use the quota to sell dutiable material.The   success of Pakistan in capturing a large share of the global quota has&quot;increased the Commonwealth share of imports from the low-cost countries (i.e.excluding Portugal and Japan) to 95 per cent of the total.n
