C(69) 95 COPY NO.    8 822nd July. 1969CABINETNATIONAL CONSULTANCY GRANTS scheme memorandum by the Pres?.denfc of the Board of TradeIntroductionThe Secretary of State for Economic Affairs circulated to the ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy (SEP(69) 67) a reportby officials reviewing public expenditure on assistance to industry.    the review summarised (paragraph 40) a proposal by the Board of Trade for payment by the Government of up to half the cost of approved consultancystudies undertaken by private agencies for small businesses.    The review by officials endorsed the case on merit for introduction of this scheme,which had earlier been discussed in some detail, but officials could not reach agreement on the priority to be accorded to it.    In this memorandum I seek the approval of my colleagues for the scheme. cBackground2,      It is widely recognised that an important factor in the lack ofcompetitiveness of British industry in recent years has been the lack of adequate professionalism in management.    Many businesses, especially the large ones, are already efficient and many very small businesses areonly of marginal importance.    But is clear from the situation brought outin the Economic Assessment to 1972, that if we are to attain our balanceof payments objective an improvement in the efficiency and performance of a considerable number of small and medium sized businesses will be acritical factor.    The situation is therefore urgent.3.      A good deal has been done to this end, for example through the workof the British Institute of Management and by the establishment of educational facilities, including business schools and managementdepartments in universities and technical colleges.    This is having someimpact.    But It is taking time.   And in the meantime the situation canonly be improved by bringing expert specialist advice to bear.
4.      There is a good deal of evidence to the effect that this is difficult in the case of the smaller business.    Small businessmen tend to beapprehensive cf consultants.    They are often people who have grown upin the business and do not realise that they are in need of expert outsideadvice.   And they may also be nervous about the elaborateness of therecommendations which they fear a consultant might provide.5.      These difficulties have led to only a tiny proportion of small businesses so far using consultants.   And this points to a serious gap inour efforts to improve the competitiveness of Eritish industry.   for small businesses are enormously important to the national economy.To begin with they account for over a quarter of manufacturing output and nearly a third of employment (in 1958 over 90 per cent of manufacturing enterprises (employing 25 or more) had fewer than 500employees and were responsible for over 30 per cent of total employment and over 27 per cent cf output).    Eat their importance cannot be measured by production and employment statistics alone.    It is the small business which is often the source of new ideas and inventions and it is small businesses which provide an important element of industrial flexibility;they produce many specialised products, in relatively small quantitiesand provide for local needs and services quickly and cheaply; they sufferless than large firms from industrial disputes;  they have advantages inquicker decision taking and lower overheads; and at a time when there isan increasing concentration of economic power, they provide opportunityfor individual initiative.6.      There is also evidence that the use of consultants is of particular value to the smaller firm.    A significant number of consultancyorganisations employ many specialists in the problems of small businesses and management consultants can often offer a greateradvantage to the smaller business.    A study made by Professor Johnston(of Manchester University) of the work of the four largest firms of management consultants found &quot;a rather striking tendency for the averageproductivity increase to be inversely related to the size of the appliedlabour force&quot;.    (The same study recorded that the average job underreview yielded net savings of about  14,000 and achieved a productivityincrease of over 50 per cent with an applied labour force of 110).    Andthere have been several calls for more to be done to help small businesses employ consultants.    The National Economic DevelopmentOffice Productivity Advisory Services Group, set up after the firstNational Productivity Conference, reported in July, 1967 not only thatthere was widespread need for small businesses to have more access toexpert advice but, with the explicit support of the TUC, recommendedthat there should be Government financial aid to widen the use ofconsultants by small businesses.    The Advisory Council for Science and technology in its July 1968 report on Technological Innovation recommendedGovernment help such as loans and grants to encourage small firms toimprove production methods and to exploit promising projects.    And theIndustrial Committee of the Scottish Economic Planning Council who had also been considering the problem were about to submit proposals of theirown when the pilot scheme was being planned.-2-
Pilot Scheme7.      To get some idea of the desirable size and shape of the nationalconsultancy scheme a pilot scheme was run In Bristol and Glasgow betweenJune, 1968 and the end of February this year.    In this period over10 per cent of all eligible manufacturing businesses took part in thescheme; in total 313 applications from 245 businesses were approved;over 60 per cent of the successful applicants said that they had not usedconsultants before.    This response is particularly encouraging bearing inmind the problems experienced by the Economic Development councils and elsewhere in trying to achieve effective contact with and action bythe host of small and medium size firms,Proposal8,      My conclusion therefore is that there is a need - with the minimum -possible delay - for a national consultancy grants scheme under whichsmall businesses throughout the country would be helped to secure expert advice and thus the competitiveness improved of a sector accounting in total for a quarter of British industry.    Apart from the direct benefits&apos; which would accrue to the businesses which participate the attentionwhich the scheme would focus on increasing efficiency and performancewould I hope have side effects which would spread fairly widely throughindustry.9,      The scheme would need legislation, for which space has been provisionally reserved in the main programme for 1969-70.    It wouldempower the Board of Trade to provide grants of up to 50 per cent forbusinesses between 50 and 500 employees.    The legislation would providefor committing expenditure over five years of between  10 million and 15 million (initially  10 million with a provision for the addition of 5 million by Order),    (The scheme would end after five years; I see noreason for indefinite assistance).    The detailed operation of the scheme would be reviewed each year.    Expenditure in 1970-71 would total some 2 million and in the following year perhaps  3 million.Timing10.      The success of the pilot schemes in Bristol and Glasgow hasalready attracted a good deal of attention and widespread support hasbeen expressed for a national scheme.    Since then I have had to sayseveral times in the House that we had under consideration the possibilityof a national scheme.    So far we have managed to keep enquirers at bay by saying that we have been analysing in de-rail the results of the pilot scheme.But I do not think it will be possible to maintain this line into the autumn.We shall have to say when Parliament re-assembles at the end of Octoberwhether we have or have not decided to embark on a national scheme.    Ifwe do not we shall - both for the reasons I have given earlier and in viewof the undoubted success of the pilot scheme - come in for a good deal of criticism.-3-
11.       It could be argued that there is no need for us to take a decision until October.    But this would be mistaken.    Once an announcement of thescheme is made businesses would tend to hold back on prospectiveassignments in order to qualify for the grant.    This would make itdesirable for the legislation to permit the payment of grants forassignments undertaken after the announcement.    But this makes it important to keep the interval between the announcement and legislation as short as possible.    We need therefore to start drafting the Bill now with Parliamentary Counsel in order to be ready for an announcement inOctober.Treasury Comments12,      Y/hile fully sharing the general view that a good firm of consul -tants can make a contribution to increasing the productivity and therefore -the profitability of an enterprise which has not previously engaged such services, the Treasury regret that the opportunity of the pilot schemeswas not taken to establish the extent to which such results are likely tobe obtained from Government assisted schemes of the kind now underconsideration, bearing in mind that the supply of consultants of the rightcalibre may be limited and that the demand for their service is undca?w.stood to be heavy.    The Board of Trade appear to have conceived of the objective of the pilot schemes as being solely to assess the extent towhich demand can be stimulated by Government grants.    There hasbeen no systematic appraisal of the results actually achieved, in termsof productivity and profitability, and figures quoted from isolated casesappear to be estimates provided by the consultants rather than results obtained from the firms using them.13.       While agreeing that there is nevertheless a certain case onmerit for the proposed general scheme, the Treasury do not considerthat an over-riding case has been made out for deciding in its favourat this juncture, while the Board of Trade are not in a position tocontribute to the scaling down of existing programmes of assistanceto industry.    (The Board of Trade have indicated the possibility ofa shortfall in investment grants expenditure in 1970-71 but there isno assurance that this will materialise and indeed no guarantee against a net upward revision in the forecasts at a later stage).This implies that the Board of Trade do not give this proposalpriority over any of their existing programmes, and it is arguablewhether it should be given priority over existing or new programmes of other Departments at this juncture,14,       I do not share these views.    On the first point we are satisfiedon the basis of previous experience both in this country and NorthernIreland (where a similar scheme has been in operation for some years)that the greater employment by firms of business consultants will leadto an increase in their efficiency.    We are carefully evaluating theresults of the consultancies carried out under the pilot scheme, butthis will take some considerable time and can in any case hardly be
measured with precision.    I do not think we can afford to wait so long.On the second point, the possibility of finding offsetting savingselsewhere, I have already explained why this is not possible giventhe particular structure of Board of Trade expenditure,Business Advisory Services15,       Officials have recently been engaging and will be furtherengaged in the autumn on a good deal of discussion about the structure of Government Business Advisory Services,    Some degree of rationalisation of these services may be necessary.    proposals will no doubt be coming to us from officials to this end and we shall need to consider whether to authorise on this basis consultations with industry,-   But I do not think that v/e would be justified in holding up this scheme pending the outcome of these discussions.    The drafting of legislation and its passage through the House will take time and theneed to improve the competitiveness and efficiency of the smallerbusiness is urgent.Conclusion16.       The most important single problem which the economy facesis changing management attitudes in British industry, in particularin the smaller firms which are by nature more difficult to reach bythe teaching of business techniques.    If we can do something substantialto improve the competitive efficiency of these smaller firms - accounting for over a quarter of our output we shall make a striking contribution tothe expansion of exports and to import saving.    It is for these reasonsthat after testing the market through two very successful pilotoperations in Bristol and Glasgow the Board of Trade have put forward a scheme for a national consultancy grants scheme which would needlegislation costing some  2 million in 1970-71 and up to  15 million over five years.    The benefits to our balance of payments would be out of proportion to this modest expenditure,    I do not believetherefore that we can afford either to lose this opportunity or to wait.    Accordingly I ask my colleagues to endorse the scheme sothat the drafting of the legislation can start now and the schemeannounced and the Bill laid in the autumn.C.A.R.C.Board of Trade, S.V7.1,22nd July, 1969
