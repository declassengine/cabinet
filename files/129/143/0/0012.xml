C(69) 87 COPY NO,18th July. 1969CABINETCONCORDE TEST ROUTESMemorandum by the Lord ChancellorNow that the Concorde test programme Is under way it is becoming a matter of urgency to decide on the routes to be used forsupersonic flying so that preparatory work can be put in hand.    TheHome Affairs Committee have given extensive consideration to theproblems that arise and I think it right to report to my colleagues ontheir discussions and on the conclusions which they have reached,,2.      Most of the test flying will be on circuits over the South WestApproaches and the North Sea and it is unlikely that any supersonic bangsfrom these would be heard on land.    But for some of the more exactingtests it is necessary to have a straight route of about 800 miles so that theaircraft can accelerate to supersonic cruising speed, cruise for about20 minutes and then return to a sub-sonic speed.    To minimise the risks and to facilitate recovery of wreckage in the event of a disaster the routechosen for the purpose should so far as possible meet the followingrequirements -(i) The aircraft should be within radar range,(ii) The route should be within reach of airfields for emergencylandings,(iii) The route should be within range of air-sea rescue helicopters.(iv) The route should avoid water too deep for the recovery ofwreckage.Against these technical requirements must be set the desirability of reducing to a minimum the disturbance and damage which might result from the aircraft flying over land and in particular over heavily populated areas.-1-
3.      The route which in. the judgment of the Ministry of Technology bestsatisfies these criteria would run along the Western fringes of Great Britain,passing a little to the west of Fort William and the Isle of Arran, thenceover the North Channel and the Irish Sea and along the western coast ofPembroke and crossing Cornwall in the neighbourhood cf Truro,    Sonicbangs would be at their most intense along this line, but would be experienced in diminishing degree within 25 or 30 miles on either sideof the route.    This &quot;carpet&quot; would include the v/estern approaches to Glasgow, much of Ayrshire, Belfast, the whole of Pembrokeshire and parts of the adjoining counties and the whole of Cornwall.   Although the route has been chosen to avoid so far as possible heavily populated areaswhile meeting the technical requirements, it is estimated that about two million people might experience sonic bangs.    The problem is madethe more difficult by the fact that apart from Cornwall, England wouldbe almost entirely unaffected, the main sufferers being Scotland and, toa less extent, Northern Ireland and Wales.4.      The number of flights which would be carried out over thisstraight route cannot be estimated with accuracy because inevitably itwill depend on how satisfactory the earlier tests prove.    But it is thoughtthat an average of one supersonic flight a week for three years may betaken as the approximate upper limit, while if the earlier tests provedfavourable and the pilot had every confidence in the aircraft the totalnumber might be as little as 40 or 50,    To keep things in proportionI should mention that overland supersonic flying is regularly carried outby military aircraft for research and other purposes, involving about100 flights a year, in the main o^er East Anglia and mid-Wales,,5,      The Home Affairs Committee have sought in a series of meetingsto satisfy themselves that there is no satisfactory alternative to thisWest Coast route and on two occasions have had the assistance of expertsfrom the Ministry of Technology.    We have considered a route over theNorth Sea, but a substantial part of this would lie outside radar range,it would be further from emergency airfields and out cf reach of rescuehelicopters and more of it would lie over deep water.    We have also considered a route down the East Coast running over the Orkneys,touching North-East Scotland and crossing East Anglia, but this wouldhave to extend well over France if its northern tip was to be within radarrange and twice as many people would be subject to disturbance.6,      I think I can say that the result of these deliberations has been to convince even the most sceptical members cf the Committee that there isno practical alternative to U3ing the West Coast route, at least for theearlier and more hazardous tests, though it should be our aim to switchtesting to the North Sea route as soon as possible.    It is unfortunate thatthe disturbance caused by use of the West Coast route would be concentrated in Scotland and the position of the Secretary of State has been formallyreserved.    But the risk of embarrassment can be much reduced bycareful presentation and by placing the Concorde testing in the context ofother supersonic flights, in particular the research flights.    public reaction is unpredictable and we may find that these occasional flightsattract less attention than we fear.-2-
7.      VtThichever route we choose, if it involves supersonic flying overland some form of legislative action will be required.    Damage may be caused, even through some unfortunate accident (e.g. a rickety buildingcollapsing) loss of life; and clearly provision for compensation must bemade.    Complete protection could only be secured by passing a bill through Parliament, because only in this way could we overcome thedifficulty that to carry out without express statutory authority tests whichit is known will cause damage is unlawful and that an injunction might beissued restraining them; this is what the Attorney-General would prefer.A lesser degree of protection could be secured by introducing an Order inCouncil applying section 40 of the Civil Aviation Act, which would mean that no action would lie in respect of trespass or nuisance by reason only of the flight of an aircraft over any property at a height above the groundwhich was reasonable having regard to wind, weather and all thecircumstances of the case and would make provision for compensation.The passage of a Bill would involve a series of debates which would focusundesirable attention on this aspect of the Concorde project and theCommittee concluded on balance that the slight risk involved in proceeding by Order in Council should be accepted.    The Order would not be made until the autumn.conclusion.      I invite the Cabinet to agree that the West Coast route should beused and that planning should go forward on this basis.    No announcement to this effect need be made for the time being and the manner of presentation requires further study, but the Minister of Technology wishes to make a holding statement before the House rises by way of answer to a written Parliamentary Question in the terms annexed.G,House of Lords, S.W.1,18th July, 1969-3-
CONDORDE TEST ROUTESProposed Written Question and AnswerQUESTIONTo aslc the Minister of Technology when he expects to announce a decision on the Concorde test routes?DRAFT ANSWERWe have examined the advantages and disadvantages of a numberof routes.    We now propose to discuss the implications of the proposedroute pattern with the parties that would be affected.    I will make astatement as soon as possible in the House on the routes finally selected.
