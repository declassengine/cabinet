DO&apos;JUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BS.ITAKKTG MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 93 copy NO-21st July, 1969CABINETCONCORDE TEST ROUTESNote by the Attorney-GeneralThe attached memorandum, on the legislative implications ofthe Concorde&apos;s supersonic testing, has been considered by the HomeAffairs Committee;  and I am circulating it for the information of theCabinet in connection with their discussion of the proposals forConcorde Test R.outes, put forward in the Lord Chancellorsmemorandum (C(69) 37).F.S. J.Law Officers&apos;Department, W.C.2.21st July, 1969
COIICOKDE TEST. ROUTESMeuorandun by; the. Attorney general in his paper of 21st April 1959 (h(69) 24) the Minister of technology explained that when the Concorde is tested at stipersonicspeed it will produce hangs likely to cause material damage to persons and property beneath its flight path.     I was invited to considerwhether as a result it was necessary to introduce a Bill seekingstatutory atithority for the tests or whether the natter could hedealt with by way of subordinate legislation. .2.     If a test route is chosen which does not involve the likelihood of damage of that nature on the ground, the question of legislation or subordinate legislation does not arise.3.     If however the tests are likely to cause such damage two quiteseparate questions arise.     The first is whether it is proper thattests which it is known will cause damage should be carried out withoutexpress statutory authority, and the second is what steps are necessaryto protect the Crown against actions for danagos or proceedingsrequiring the tests to ho discontinued.4.     As to the first.     In authorising the tests the Crown would notonly be risking clains in respect of nuisance without any logalprotection but it would bo acting in broach of the law.     A scries ofsonic bangs of the intensity contemplated could constitute an indictablemisdemeanour at common law.     Further section 11 of the Civil AviationAct 1949 provides that whoro an aircraft is flown in such a manner as tobo the cause of unnecessary danger to any person or project)orty on land or
CONFIDENTIAL

or water, the pilot or the person in charge of the aircraft, and also the owner thereof unless he proves to the satisfaction of the court that the aircraft was so flown without his actual fault or privity, shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding two hundred pounds or to imprisonment for a torn not exceeding six months or to both. It is my view that the Crown should not authorise an act which in a private individual would be unlawful, without express statutory authority. It would be wrong to assume that legislation is unnecessary on the ground that adequate redress for damage done could always be ensured by the payment of compensation. In many cases of damage to property the payment of compensation would afford adequate redress, though this would not necessarily be true where, for instance, damage was caused to historic buildings. But in some cases of personal injury nothing by way of damages could afford adequate compensation. It could happen that a bang would shatter a greenhouse or plate glass window and result in death or blindness. Accordingly I cannot advise that it would be proper to carry out tests likely to cause damage without parliamentary approval.

5. The second question that arises is what steps should be taken to protect the Crown against actions for damages or, perhaps more important, proceedings for a declaration that would require the tests to be discontinued. Clearly this could be done by legislation.

6. As an alternative it has been suggested that the position could be secured by introducing an Order in Council applying section 40 of the Civil Aviation Act 1949 to Crown aircraft. This section provides that no action shall lie in respect of trespass or in respect of nuisance by reason only of the flight of an aircraft over any property at a height above the ground which having regard to wind weather and all the circumstances of the case is reasonable, or the ordinary incidents of such flight so long as certain provisions of the Act or Orders made thereunder are complied with. The language of this section has the result that in considering the height above the ground at which a flight occurs the test of reasonableness is always applicable and is not removed, for example, by the circumstance that a sonic bang is an ordinary incident of the flight. Because reasonableness raises


questions of nixed law and fact it is therefore not possible to guarantee that a successful action might not bo brought against theCrown in respect of damage caused by tho test flights.     in considering the question of reasonableness tho Court would attachgroat importance to tho rotito of the test path.     If it can beconvincingly shown that the choice of route is calculated to reducedamage to a minimum and if, at tho same time, tho height of tho flightis regulated with the same objective, and if further the applicationof the provisions of an Order is confined in the first instance totost flights, the likelihood of proceedings being successful wouldbe substantially reduced,7,     It has boon suggested that support might be given to a defencebased on section 40 of the Civil Aviation Act 1949 as applied to crown aircraft if an additional Order in Council regulating tho testflights was made under section 8 (2) of the Civil Aviation Act 1949as amended by section 19 (0 of tho Civil Aviation Act 1968.     Thissection adds to the Orders regulating air navigation which may be madeunder section 8 (2) of the 1949 Act, Orders for regulating orprohibiting the flight of aircraft over the United Kingdom at speedsin excess of Flight Kach I.     Such Orders arc subject to negative resolution and it could be argued for the Crown that supersonic flying in accordance with such an Order had received the approval of parliament and was thus protected under section 40.     I cannot advise that this argument xirould necessarily commend itself to tho Court.     The Courtnight take the view that a provision enabling Orders to be made for regulating or prohibiting supersonic flying envisaged tho making ofOrders for tho protection of the public and could not be relied upon as affecting rights tho public would otherwise have.     On the otherhand the Court night take tho view that the amendments made bysection 19 of tho 1968 Act indicated that Parliament clearlycontemplated supersonic flying being carried out over tho UnitedKingdom and that flying in accordance with Orders in Council madepursuant to that provision was protected.     *n view of thisuncertainty, tho making of an additional Ordor in Council mightnot be helpful.
8.     My conclusion is that although I think tho prospect of proceedings succeeding against the Croxm is slight, the possibilityof an adverse finding cannot bo excluded.     There is a furtherobjection to the uso of tho Order in Council procedure and thatis an objection of principle.     I think it undesirable in principle to rely upon the procodtire by way of Order in Council insofar asit seeks to reduce the scope of cither the offence of flying insuch a manner as to bo the cause of unnecessary danger undersection 11 of the Civil Aviation Act 1949 or of a contravention of Article 40 of the Air Navigation Order 1966 (wilfully endangering&apos;property).     The scope of those provisions can only properly be restricted by means of legislation, so both on general grounds andto ensure that the Crown is adequately protected I cannot advise that tho Order in Council procedure should bo followed in preference to legislation.(Ihtld.)
