I 7tSECRETNATIONALISED INDUSTRIES INVESTMENT REVIEW 1969Note by Officialsintroduction1,  This paper reports the results of officials&apos; examination of the investment programmes of the nationalised industries and sets out the1   options which are open to Ministers both on future investment and on prices..   In 1970 the Investment programmes and revenue forecasts of the nationalised industries will be handled as part of the annual public expenditure Survey following a recommendation of the Public ExpenditureReview Committee which Ministers approved in March.   This year, however,as explained in the Main Report of PESO, timetable difficulties have prevented this, and the programmes have been brought forward for decision as soon as possible after the main survey papers.Background;   PESO and MTAC2. Ministers will be familiar, from their discussions over the past fewweeks, with the main elements of the medium-term economic forecast andthe prospects for the rest of public expenditure.   The key facts are that there is a prospective deficit in national resources of  250- 350million in 1970-71 and of  250- k5O million in 1971-72.   This imbalancel has to be corrected either by reductions in public expenditure or by removing purchasing power from the economy j   the second alternative! would involve increasing taxes or public sector prices or some comblna-I tion of the two.   Various possibilities on the public expenditure frontl are under discussion.   The Chancellor recently circulated a paper!&quot; (0(69)72) proposing a reduction in 1970-71 public expenditure programmes of  i+00 million in programme terms (which might be expected to produce&quot;I savings of about  250- 300 million in terms of resources).   In thisi paper he indicated that he looked for a substantial contribution of 150 million in all from the defence budget and the nationalisedI industries.like Investment programmesI 3* The pattern of fixed investment by the nationalised industries I in the U.K. is as follows:1

The overriding consideration here is the need to distribute natural gas as it becomes available.(d) Steel:   a substantial rise in expenditure on modernisation and expansion is foreseen over the whole review period, withexpenditure in the early 1970*8 nearly three times the 1968-69level.   Approval is however only sought at this stage to expenditure in the current year.The reduction of nearly  30 million in 1970-71 on the figures includedp the PESC Report arises from a more realistic assessment of the invest-nent programmes of Area Electricity Boards (now  16 million less),combined with various changes designed to secure more realistic transportprogrammes (notably for BRB and NFC, now  14 million less).k* These and the remaining programmes are described in the appendices(1-18) attached.   The appendices also set out the various reductions inthe programmes which could be made if Ministers wished, together withtheir consequences.   These are summarised at the end of this paper.Baals of ^recasting5* As to the rest of the public expenditure field, the basic assumptionBj&quot;te in these forecasts is continuation of present policy.   In the case2
if trading organisations such as the nationalised industries, this istaken generally to imply that (except for the planned run-down of coal)the industries will invest sufficient to maintain and renew theirexisting assets and expand them to meet expected new demand.   The levelof demand assumed takes account of forecasts of growth of QDP and of consumer expenditure supplied last autumn by the central economicdepartments.   In the light of this summer^ MTAC report these now lookslightly too high, but the difference does not significantly affect the levels of expenditure proposed for 1970-71 and 1971-72 or, where it does,as with expenditure by the gas and electricity Area Boards, the figuresalready allow for this.6, In a number of cases - steel and the British Railways Board areinstances - the new managements have not been in office for long enoughto make comprehensive estimates of future demand for their services onIthe basis of the policies laid down by the Government, and consequentlyhave had to make their investment programmes for a short period ahead andon a somewhat provisional basis.   In other cases - again mainly in thetransport field - the responsibility of the authorities is in processof changing and future investment plans may be modified in consequence.Thus the London Transport Board will next year hand over to the GLC, andthe scope of the port investment programme will be increased after theNational Ports Authority takes over.Shortfallh Experience shows that, however careful the forecasting of expenditureon individual programmes, expenditure by the industries generally fallsappreciably short of the approved figures.   Account needs to be taken of*his when considering the size of the programmes and the prospective callsp resources which they represent.   An allowance for shortfall was madein the provisional figures given in the PESO report.   (This shortfall isseparate from the general shortfall provision for the rest of the public sector which was also included in the PESO report.)   This allowance hasbeen carried forward into the revised figures now recommended by depart-Nnts, but on a slightly different basis to take account of the latestRational income forecasts.   These suggest that it is proper to increasetoe shortfall allowance for the period up to 1971-72 by  25 million in[969-70 and 1970-71, and (by extension) by  50 million in 1971-72.   The^vision for shortfall now included is  100 million for 1969-70,  125fillion for 1970-71 and  150 million for 1971-72.   On further considerstioa10 allowance for shortfall is now thought to be appropriate for laterrs given the difficulties and uncertainties involved in the preparationjof investment programmes for these years.   Proceeding on this basis3SECRET
glightly reduces the net total of the programmes for the early years,after allowing for shortfall, compared with the figures shown in thePESO report.   In addition the programmes themselves, as now submitted arein aggregate somewhat below those figures.   It should be noted that the shortfall provision is applied to the total of nationalised industriesfixed investment and is not attributed;   it is not therefore reflected in the approvals sought for individual industry programmes.Tnvestment criteria8, In principle, all new investment by nationalised industries is inten-ded to be profitable.   It is expected to show a return of at least 8 percent (discounted cash flow) in real terms - that is, after allowing forinflation.   (The proposal to increase the test discount rate to 10 percent at present being considered could not significantly affect thefigures in this year&apos;s programmes.)   Not all investment plans are in factappraised in thi3 way, so it is not possible simply to apply uniformmeasures of profitability to all programmes and to eliminate the lowestyielders if reductions are required.   Instead a number of optionalReductions in investment are identified later in the paper, and their implications are set out in the industry appendices.PriceyIt This year, for the first time, the Public Expenditure Survey includesReceipts as well as expenditure.   In the case of the nationalised indus-trlea, this has meant bringing into the Survey the gross trading surplusesh)f the nationalised industries.   These surpluses also enter into thejcalculation of the imbalance*-   Like increased taxes or contributions,increased prices by the nationalised industries are an alternative to reductions in public expenditure.   But, unlike most taxes, higher pricespre directly linked with particular goods and services.   Current govern-ient policy, as set out in Grand. 3437, is that prices should be keptptfoadly in line with the costs of supply;   but to the extent that therelis room for Judgment about the timing or size of price increases,pere are real options here comparable to those on expenditure.   So forjtoe first time Ministers have the opportunity to consider action on thepices of the nationalised industries, as part of their general review$ public expenditure and revenue.f&apos; As paragraph 12(iv) of the main PESC report makes clear, thefgures of nationalised industries&apos; gross trading surpluses taken into^count in the PESC and MTAC reports assume that Ministers will be spared to approve increases in nationalised industry tariffs when, andI the extent necessary, to keep pace with increases in costs.   Thetf:ent to wilich price increases would be needed in the years covered by&quot;Moh^6? cannot be foreseen.   This would depend upon the rate at[i    costs and efficiency increase compared with forecasts and the
level at which new financial objectives are set.   To the extent thatapprove for price increases needed to keep pace with rising costs is:delayed, or withheld, as has happened on some occasions in the past,^nationalised industries&apos; surpluses will fall, and compensating savingsI will need to be found elsewhere in the public sector or by action on other fronts, e.g. by higher taxation, if the forecast imbalance is notto increase.11,   In some cases Ministers have the option at present of seeking tonegotiate new financial objectives at a level higher than might other-wise be proposed, so increasing the surpluses at which the industries are required to aim; and reducing the currently assessed imbalance.The scope for action of this sort is limited to industries providing thejgoods and services for which the demand is steadily rising, and industries which are not subject to severe competition from the private &quot;sectors/whose prices are not at least partially fixed by international agreements.     This rules out industries such as the National Coal Board,most of the transport sector, and the air lines.     The option of higher prices arises in effect only in the case of electricity and gas (for;which new targets need to be set forthwith) and telecommunications(where there is an existing target which would have to be revised).A passenger service charge at airports could also be reintroduced.Action on these lines would require these industries to make price increases greater than the &quot;keep pace&quot; level indicated in the preceding paragraph.Results of review112   The results of the review can be summarised as follows.     Thefigures in both cases allow for shortfall, and in the case of the laterfigures, for reductions recommended by departments:I  million at 1969 survey prices1969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74Figures in PESC report      1,543     1,583     1,588     1,661     1,764Revised figures 1,480     1,531     1,493     1,643    1,723Reduction 63 52 95 18 41I Ihe reductions already in prospect for 1970-71 represent a start to&quot;finding the reduction of  150 million from defence and the nationalisedI;industries referred to in the Chancellor&apos;s recent paper.

Nearly 90 per cent of the proposed capital expenditure is onplant, in particular trunk and junction and local circuits and exchangeequipment.   About one third of the provision is required to improveservices to, and to handle increased traffic from, existingsubscribers.    Most of the remainder is required to meet the demandfor new connections (including the reduction   of the cuirrent waitinglist) and to handle the traffic generated by them.3. The Post Office say that the rate of demand for new connectionscontinues to increase with the result that they now have to plan fora 55 per cent growth over the Review period compared with the 50 per1- appendix 1POST OFFICE INVESTMENT PROGRAMME. 1969
cent growth they planned last year for the period up to March 197,3.in&apos;addition, there are requirements for increased expenditure, whichcould not have &quot;been anticipated last year, on projects which include a transatlantic cable and an increased contribution to INTELSAT.u     For these reasons the Post Office propose that expenditure forthe period 1969-70 to 1972-73 should be . 183 million higher than thatIincluded in the investment programme last year.    This total includes! increases of 3 per cent ( 11 million) for 1969-70 and 9 per cent;( 36 million) for 1970-71 above the levels approved by Ministers inSeptember 1968 (;SEP(66)20th Meeting, Conclusion (2)).    Of the 1970-71increase  4 million is for the advance ordering of exchange equipment to smooth out the industry&apos;s transition to higher production levels andto safeguard about 1 ,200 jobs in Development Areas next winter.    the levels proposed for 1971-72 and 1972-73 are nearly 15 per cent: ( 58 mill ion) and 20 per cent ( 78 million) above last year&apos;s forecasts.:(b)   Financing implications5, At 1969-70 prices throughout, the programme has a theoreticalI self-financing ratio of about 6k per cent, with borrowing from the&apos;National Loans Fund as follows:-  million1969-70     1970-71      1971-72       1972-75       197V7U176.8 204.6 180.8 155.1 115.116,    But these figures are illusory.    A realistic prospect, allowing- for expected pay and price increases, is that total borrowing overI the period will amount not to  832 million but to about  1 ,205 million.This is the assumption on which the imbalance in the economy has been calculated.    On this basis the Post Office expects to finance 51 perI cent of the programme, and with productivity gains more than offsettingincreasing costs, to be able marginally to exceed the current target of 8f per cent set in 1968 without the need to increase tariffs.OptionsOfficials have considered the effects of a 10 per cent cut in expenditure.    The Post Office say that because of existing commitmentsjit would fall disproportionately on later years.    It would affect allthe main elements of the programme; congestion would worsen and thequality of the service to customers would deteriorate.    The waiting^st would be over 600,000 in 1974 compared with the 30,000 currently
envisaged,   (it is therefore unrealistic to think of so severe a cutwithout tariff action to reduce demand.)  Additionally,  Orders wouldbe met more slowly: operational improvements would have to be deferred;and it would be impossible for the productivity improvements to beachieved in full.    About 7,0C0 fewer jobs would be created in development Areas, and future supplies of plant of all kinds wouldbe prejudiced.8.     An alternative might be to increase tariffs.    The effect would depend on where the increase fell.    If raised from call tariffs, theeffect on investment would be small &quot;but, if raised from rental orconnection charges, both demand and investment requirements would belowered.    (For example,  it has been estimated that a  U increase onexclusive line rentals made in 1972, which would be equivalent to5 per cent overall on telecommunications charges, would reduceinvestment by some  50 million and borrowing reauirements by about 100 million over the remainder of the review period.)    At the sametime the increased return on capital would need to be reflected in a revised financial target.     The Post Office would object to earlytariff increases on the grounds that without them they expect to achieve their recently determined target return on capital over the five-year period and that an arbitrary  change of target after so short a period would undermine continuity of planning and development.    They alsoargue that it would not be right to commit the new Post Office Board tofurther tariff increases in advance; that charges were raisedsubstantially as recently as October 1968; and that a period of stabletelecommunications prices would contribute to keeping industrial costsdown.recommendations.     Ministers are asked to take a view on whether:(i)    the telecommunications investment programme should beagreed at the levels proposed by the Post Office, viz:  million1969-70     1970-71     1971-72      1972-75      1975-7U360.9        h-27.0        ki+8.9 U75.8 U93.7or(ii)    whether the programme shou1d be cut by 10 per cent or somelesser percentage, with the consequences outlined inparagraph 7 above;and/or
(iii)    whether further consideration should he given to thepossibility of raising the telecommunications financialtarget, thus requiring an increase of prices,  to augment the self-financing and to reduce demand and investment.B.

The major items in the Post/Giro programme are related to thecontinued introduction of mechanical sorting offices and the replace-ment of obsolete offices.(b) Financing implications11. At constant prices, the borrowing requirements of this programme are:But at forecast outturn prices borrowing requirements would beIncreased over the period from  123.h million to  296 million, unlesstariff increases are introduced.12.   In order to achieve their current target for the five-year period ending 1972-73, the Post Office consider that it will benecessary to raise charges substantially.    (For example, assuming anoperational date of mid-1970, extra revenue of about  50 million per annum would be required.)    Without such increases the annualimbalance will be substantially increased.Options13.   Officials have considered the effects of a cut in 1970-71expenditure.   A cut of, say, 10 per cent in the building allocationwould reduce expenditure in that year by  1 .2 million and consequentiallyof about  1 .U million in 1971-72.   These cuts would, however, entail the deferment of about half the large mechanisation schemes due to start in 1970-71, which are expected to produce returns considerably in excess of the current test discount rate and on which the PostOffice depends to increase productivity, as well as smaller schemesdesigned to replace obsolete buildings.  million?6?-70     1970-7133.3 28.61971-72     1972-73     1973-7U25.8 20.8 1U.91-h

The outturn for 1968-69 was  52 million compareddth an approved figure of  66 million.

The outturn for 1968-69 was  52 million comparedwith an approved figure of  66 million.   Last year Ministers were not satisfied that the Board&apos;s investment programme could be justified interms of Government fuel policy and approval of only  53 million outof the total of  63 million proposed for colliery investment was approved for 1969-70.3- The Boards current programme is more soundly based on an assess-tient of demand derived from an exercise involving individual pits. Thelain assumptions made by the Board are that:(i)   productivity will reach 75 cwts per man shift by 1975;I ; (ii)   coal demand   will be 135 million tons in 1975;(ill)   the annual reduction in manpower should not exceed more thanI10 per cent a year overall;(iv)   the Government will continue to subsidise additional coalconsumption at power stations over the four years 1971-72 to1974-75.
1^     Ministers agreed at IN(69)3rd Meeting on 13th March that theIBoard&apos;s manpower and supply plans for 1969-70 were acceptable.    The policyIfor succeeding years wild, be considered by Ministers later this year.So far as   productivity and demand estimates, are concerned the Ministrycf Fower&apos; s own view is that these are more likely to be 66 cwts amanshift and 120 million tons respectively in 1975.   Even if productivitywere to reach the Board&apos;s figure of 75 cwts the Ministry consider demandfor NCB coal would be nearer 126 million tons than 135 million tons.1,     The effect of these different demand assumptions on investment is,I however, very small.   The number of pits and manpower required in 1975would be roughly the same whether the NCB&apos;s or the Ministry&apos;s estimates were accepted.   The Board estimate that the most extreme case (demand of; only 120 million tons but productivity of 75 cwts.)     would result in 25I fewer pits and a    5 million reduction in investment falling mainly inlithe three years from 1971-72.   There is no difference of opinion betweenIthe Ministry and the NCB about demand in 1970-71, the year for whichfirm investment approval is necessary.16. Ancillary investment.    The NCB propose to spend  10 million a year on non-colliery projects; this is about  4 million more than was actuallyspent in each of the last two years.   More than half ( 5.5 million) in1 1970-71 is for expenditure on coal products and includes some projectsI ( 1.5 million) with which the Board will only proceed if they are satisfiedkoh technical and economic merits.   On the   other hand some projects only[slightly more doubtful, which have been excluded from the programme, maypall for reinstatement when technical problems have been overcome.   In thecircumstances we see no reason for putting a lower limit at this stageEon the expenditure proposed, but recommend that the Minister of Power shouldIreserve approval of expenditure on the uncertain projects until moreI information is available.I Other   capital expenditure12^20  million at March 1969 prices1970-71   1971-72   1972-73   1973-74Trade undertakingsNorth Sea gas3631031034342-2
h     The proposal for spending  3 million a year in the acquisitionIfld expansion of interests in subsidiary companies reflects a reduction112 million made by Ministers last year.    It also takes account of acondition attaching to approval of a new project (caprolactam) earlierl^is year that the cost must be met within the total allocation for^versification..    The provision for North Sea gas is partly for develop-ient of a field ( 8 million) and partly for further exploration ( 2 million).It represents the best estimates at the time, but the amounts and timing of expenditure depend on the size and location of fields discovered.I    The Ministry of Power are continuing their discussions with theKB about investment appraisal methods and these will be extended infuture to include the Treasury and DEA.Financing implicationsI,    In 1968-69 a revenue deficit of  9 million was incurred.   Thefinancial estimates for later years assume that selective coal price increases totalling  15 million in a full year, which have been referredgo the NBPI, will be effective from 1st October 1969.   Ministers havesagreed that the NCB*s new financial objective for 1969-70 and 1970-71!should   be to bxeak even after making proper charges for interest and depreciation including allowance for any difference between the cost of[replacement of assets at current as opposed to historic costs, but the NCBhave not yet accepted this proposal.   The objective after March 1971 willlie negotiated in the light of the longer-term prospects of the industry,it this stage, therefore, the figures of net borrowings supplied by the[Board, and reproduced below, should be&apos; treated with reservation particul-larly as they assume a trading surplus of  10 million in the years fromIW71-72, and falling coal stocks:-Net borrowing   million at 1969 prices1969-70      1970-71      1971-72       1972-73       1973-743 -1 -10 -4 -7lotions10,   There is no scope for modifying the Board&apos;s investment programmer for increasing prices beyond the levels necessary to meet theiftoancial objective.I 2-3

More than half thedifference is accounted for by Area Boards who have a record of over-estimating.    The Central Electricity Generating Board&apos;s and area boards&apos; current programmes have been considered against the background of the industry&apos;s demand forecasts for the years up to 1976-77, andthe effect of this demand forecast on the pattern of generating6tntion order s .),   The CEGB&apos;s programme includes no station starts in 1969, 1In 1969, 5 in 1971 and 2 in 1972 moving to an annual rate of 3 or ha year thereafter.    All departments agree that there is now no case for1 start in 1969.    The case on demand grounds alone for a start in 1970^ not strong.    For the last six years the demand forecast has been, .        . .  7economicreduced (mainly as the unreality of the NEDCs 1963/growth assumptionstos come to be recognised) with the result that the original forecastfade in 1964 for simultaneous maximum demand in 1969-70 (53,000 MW)[flow stands for 197U-75.    The Ministry of Power feel that some reduction&apos;8 on balance rather more likely than an increase but there is littlefhance of yet a further whole year&apos;a growth (3,500 MW) being lost by&quot;ext year.The explosion in the CEGB&apos;s plant orders in the early 1960&apos;s led, 8 rapid increase in manufacturers&apos; capacity and substantial^missioning delays.   A Committee under Sir Alan Wilson reported months!tCa?8es of the delays in March 1969 (Cmad. 3960) and recommended.8i sharp variations in orders should be avoided in future to preventrecurrence of this situation.
5.    The Ministry of Power consider that the pattern of ordersproposed by the CEGB would be unacceptable on phasing grounds andirould prefer 2 starts in 1970 followed by 3 in later years, but because the load forecast might be reduced in 1970 propose to tell the CEGB not to commit themselves to a second station in 1970 untilthe situation has been reviewed in the light of the 1970 load forecast.Ministry of Technology also see an advantage in telling manufacturersabout the possibility of 2 Btetlons in 1970 and that the longer term requirements would be about 3   rders a year (assuming 1 ,320 MWstations) .   Otherwise they would be inclined to keep capacity in anticipation of 5 or more CEGB orders a year.6,    All departments agree that it would not be sensible to contemplateno starts in 1970 and officials recommend that the CEGB should make preparations for 2 starts in 1970, but with no final commitment tothe second until reviewed early next year and on the understanding that orders in 1971 would on this basis be no more than 3.   An importantconcomitant of this recommendation is that plant manufacturers shouldbe told that there would be 1 firm order and 1 possible in 1970 (apartfrom a possibility of a Scottish station in 1970 or 1971) and amaximum of 3 in 1971 on the basis of present demand forecasts,although if the load forecasts are cut heavily the three could becomeone or even none.7.    The effect of reducing the orders in 1971 from 5 to 3 would reduce investment in 1971-72 by  10 million with further reductions in later years, though additional expenditure of  5 million in 1 970-71and  13 million in 1971-72 would arise if a second start in 1970 were approved next year.   It has sIbo been agreed that departments will consider separately the fuelling of the next CEGB station.8*   Area Board expenditure is related less to long term fore-caste than to the need to reinforce distribution networks asdemand rises and to connect new consumers as required. Outturn in 1968-69iaa  139 million compared with  171 million approved, and apart fromexpenditure on I32kv  transmission which they have taken over fromtoe CEGB this year, their estimates are  20 to  30 million lower foreach year from 1969-70 than in last year1 s programme.   The MinistryQf Power&apos;s estimate of the average rate of growth of sales at 5.7 percent is lower than the Electricity Council&apos;s of 6.U per cent.   Thereto some reason to believe that the Area Boards&apos; proposals for 1970-71&quot;Mr 1971-72 maybe still on the high side.
(d)   Financing implications9.    At 1969 prices throughout, the programme would result inborrowing as shown below.    Subject to fluctuations in temporaryborrowing and any long-term borrowing overseas, these amounts will come from the National Loans Fund.  million at March 1969 prices1262z70     1970-71     1971-72     1972-73     1975-7UNet borrowing 29h 22 - 3U - 77 2h9Note: Includes  200 million stock redemption in 1969-70 and 31*4- million in 1973-74.But these figures are misleading not only because of the refinancingelements but also because they assume constant prices and constantcosts.   An alternative assumption, based upon no price increase and allowing for 3.3 per cent inflation of capital and operating costs,would mean total net borrowing of about  1 ,000 million over the fiveyear period (about  500 million higher).10.   Departments have discussed the financial objective to be agreedunder Cmnd. 3437 for the five years from 1st April   1969.   On thebasis of the industry&apos;s present revenue expectations, allowing forexpected improvements in operating efficiency (technological andlabour) and assuming no price increases in the quinquennium, theindustry would achieve a net return (comprising interest plus balanceof revenue) of 6.4 per cent, if inflation were to run at 3.3 per cent per annum (i.e. the basic case tased in MTAC).    The Ministry of Powerhave proposed a new objective of 7.0 per cent net return as abasis for detailed negotiation.   This would imply, on 3.3 per cent a year inflation, a price increase of about 3.0 per cent from april 1971.    it would increase the gross trading surplus by about 25 million in 1971-72 (and  30 million in a full year) andcontribute towards a reduction in the imbalance in the economy ascurrently estimated.   A 7.0 per cent return might be achieved withouta price increase if inflation were at a lower rate than assumed or if it proved possible to secure greater improvements in operatingefficiency than have been allowed for.   The scope for this would only become apparent during discussions with the industry.
11,   A further contribution towards reducing the overall imbalancewould be possible by fixing an appropriately higher financial objective which would involve a greater price increase from an earlier date.   A price increase of 5.0 per cent from 1st April   1970would mean additional revenue of about  60 million in that year and about  70 million in a full year and something approaching acorresponding reduction in the imbalance.   The effect on the proposedfinancial objective would be to raise it to a 7.6 per cent netreturn.Recommendations(a) Investment12,   We do not think that it would be appropriate to approve the programmes as submitted and recommend that Ministers should:(i)   approve a CEOB programme including 1 station start in1970 and not more than 3 starts a year thereafter on theunderstanding that the CEOB will make preparations forstarting an additional station in 1970 if the loadforecast justifies it next year, but no financial provision to be included at this stage.   This would give investment of  213 million in 1970-71 and  170 million in 1971-72.(ii)   approve reductions in A*ea Board investment of  12 million in 1970-71 and  18 million in 1971-72 giving totals of 160 million and  165 million respectively representingan assessment of the expenditure which will actually be incurred.Approval would be subject to not more than 80 per cent of expenditurein 1971-72 being committed in advance of next year*s review.(b) Prices13.   Officials recommend that Ministers agree to discussions withthe electricity industry for a financial objective- for aperiod of five years from 1st April 1969, expressed as a netreturn (i,e, after depreciation) on average capital employed.   the options which we ask Ministers to consider are:3-UCONFIDENTIAL

Their investment proposals are therefore considered ;as onefogramme.   The main determinant of the size of the programme is the!&amp;nd forecast for electricity five to six years ahead.   This year,[fever, departments have also had regard to the prospective orderingI item   in Great Britain as a whole, in relation to the flow of ordersIthe electrical plant manufacturers.   This is covered in more detailAppendix 3.The main new item of investment is an oil-fired generating stationInverkip (on the Clyde, near Wemyss Bay) in the SSEB&apos;s area to beted in.1970, although a design contract would be placed a year earlier,vision is also made for further expenditure on transmission andtribution.   Departments have seen the basis of investment appraisald by the Board and have no grounds for disputing that Inverkip is thet economic way of meeting additional demand.   The Ministry of Powere also considered the proposal from the point of view of resource costs the social and economic effects on the coal industry and have nofection to oil-firing.475-confidential
V5-2CONFIDENTIALI    The timing of the new station depends on the view taken of theelectricity demand forecast for 1975-76.   The Scottish forecast assumeslhat the demand for electricity in Scotland will continue to grow ata higher rate than that in the rest of Great Britain, partly &quot;becauseeconomic growth generally is expected to continue at a higher rate.   the boards   forecasting methods are sophisticated and their past record istetter than that of the Electricity Council.   Nevertheless one cannotignore that this year&apos;s load forecast for 1975-76 like that of theCgSB     is lower than was estimated last year.5,   The Boards   plan to have a 17 per cent margin of capacity as an insurance against load shedding.   On the basis of their joint load fore-cast of 8368 MW in 1975-76 they would have a margin of only 12.6 per centif the first set of Inverkip were not commissioned by the winter of 1975.But the risk to the system would be very much less than this margin irapl -les when account is taken of the possibility that the load forecast maybe on the high side still; that some retirement of old plant could be delayed; that there is likely to be some spare capacity in England andthere is a transmission link with the CEGB&apos;s system which should be capable, when necessary of transferring,up to 1500 MW   of power ( ajl,0 per cent margin in England and Wales equals a 7.1 per cent marginin Scotland).    In view of these considerations there might be advantage in delaying a decision until the 1970 load forecast is available althoughit must be recognised that this would result in higher system running costs and only small capital savings ( 1,0 million per annum in 1970-71and 1971-72).(h)  Financing implications6.

7,    On the basis of their present revenue prospects and assuming no price increases in the quinquennium, but with inflation running at 3*3 per cent per annum a net return of between  and 6 per cent would be achieved.   Whether or not price increases will in the event be needed will depend on the rateof cost inflation experienced in practice, and on thelevel at which the Boards1 financial objectives are fixed.   TheScottish Development Department consider that special regionalfactors should be taken into account before proposing a new financial objective.   Officials are examining these questions witha view to making an early recommendation to the Ministers concerned.Hecommenda t i ons8*    Officials recommend that the programmes should be approved as submitted.

Expenditure on manufacture of gas will fall to  5 million a year by 1971-72 because present plans are that plant111.be required only in areas which will not be reached by natural gas.transmission and distribution expenditure is related to the fuel policyjtarget for absorption of natural gas - 4,000 million cubic feet a daym.c.f.d.) by the mid-70&apos;s - and the industry&apos;s forecast that sales willSise by 15 per cent per annum.I   The Gas Council have already contracted to take 3,000 m.c.f.d. offorth Sea gas by 1975.    Further supplies on offer would bring this total,500 m.c.f.d.   Although the overall sales forecast is not unreasonablejjien compared with demand increases in other countries which have addedIJtural gas to their fuels, it includes an expectation that sales in thetetrial markets will increase by more than 24 per cent per annum, mainlyI the expense of oil products, in addition to the sales to ICI andgtiellstar already contracted for.   While there would be undoubted benefits the economy if the gas industry were to succeed on the scale theyjwisage, it must be recognised that the oil companies&apos; jreaction to such apllenge is not known, but the gas industry has made some allowance forcompetition.    If this allowance proves to be insufficient the gasjtostry!s financial position would be less satisfactory than forecast andly may need to reconsider their investment plans in some respect.I The Area Boards1 expenditure on district mains consists of a mass ofpi projects, and this is a difficult field to control centrally.  Thefious suggestions in   the   NBPI Second Report on Gas Prices (Cmnd 3924)fished in February 1969, in connection with investment appraisal and^er Matters, are under discussion between the Ministry of Power and theCouncil.   Other departments will be brought in when this first stagebeen completed.
A AC5.    The current investment forecasts reflect the Gas Council&apos;sassumption of responsibility for co-ordinating investment and marketing policy, even in advance of legislation to give statutoryeffect to this.    The investment programme for 1970-71 is about 30 million lower than that suggested last year, and those for1971-72, and later years,  20 million Lower.    The  20 million in1971-72 and later years was a provision should more than 4,000m.c.f.d. be proved and taken from the North Sea and depending on developments it may need to be reinstated in due course.    To this extent the programme reflects increasing realism.   But the treasury and DEA feel considerable doubt whether the estimates for 1970-71and 1971-72 are not still too high, given the ambitious natureof the sales targets and the fact that investment expenditure onfixed assets in 1968-69 was  50 million below the level approved for that year.(b) Other capital expend!ture.6.    This covers two items: expenditure by Area Boards on conversionof consumer appliances to direct use of natural gas and by the gas Council through its North Sea subsidiary on exploration anddevelopment.7.    The provision for conversion is higher than provided for in last year&apos;s review, despite the fact that the number of consumersit is expected to cover has been reduced, because the estimated costhas been increased in the light of experience from the original 30 to  35 a consumer.    The Gas Council are satisfied that the programme,which is an important part of the strategy for absorbing natural gas,can be achieved.    The provision for North Sea exploration is basedon the best estimate at present possible, but, since the Gas council are acting in partnership with an oil company (AMOCO) the preciseamounts which they will require are not wholly within their control.  million at March 1969 pricesConversionNorth Sea1969-70   1970^71   1971-72   1972 73   1973-7452.1        73.1       &quot;7975      &quot;76&quot;.4 &quot;     TO7.5 8.9 7.2 .7.0 7.0

An alternative assumption, i.e. based uponfjo price increase and 3.3 per cent inflation of capital and operating costs, would mean total net borrowing of about  1,360 million (about 300 million higher).1.     Departments have discussed the financial objective to be agreedunder Cmnd. 3437 for the five years from 1st April 1969.    On thebasis of the industry&apos; s present revenue expectations allowing for expectedImprovements in operating efficiency (technological and labour), and assuming no price increases in the quinquennium, the industry would^achieve a net return (comprising interest plus balance of revenue)of 6.5 per cent, if inflation were to run at 3.3 per cent per annumi.e. the basic case used in 1VITAC).    The Ministry of Power have proposed a&quot;objective of 7.0 per cent     net return as a basis for detailedIgotiations.   This would imply, on 3.3 per cent per annum inflation,* price increase of about 2* per cent from 1st April 1971.    It would increase the gross trading surplus by about  14 million in 1971-72jMd  16 million in a full year) and contribute towards a reduction in w imbalance in the economy as currently estimated.    A 7.0 per centpum might be achieved without a price increase if inflation were at a.0,l.er rate than assumed or if it proved possible to secure greatermovements in operating efficiency than have been allowed for.    Thei0pe for the latter may become apparent during discussions with theR8try.
10.   A further contribution towards reducing the overall imbalancewould be possible by fixing an appropriately higher financial objective which would involve a greater price increase from an earlier date.    A price increase of 5.0 per cent from 1st April 1970would mean additional revenue of about  .25 million in that year and about  30 million in a full year and something approaching acorresponding reduction in the imbalance.    The effect on the proposedfinancial objective would be to raise it to a 7.8 per cent net treturn.    Price increases that are not solely related to costs mayhave implications for fuel policy and the balance of fuels * inparticular, petroleum products and coal would become relativelymore attractive.Rec ommend at ions(a) Investment.11.   Officials recommend that Ministers consider approving one oftwo options:(i)   the programme as submitted i.e.  2h5. million for 1970-71and  212 million in 1971-72 subject to commitment of notmore than 80 per cent for 1971-72.(ii)   95 per cent of the amounts proposed for fixed investment in 1970-71 and 1971-72 on the basis that the programmeappears too ambitious as regards sales and rate of spending.This means approval of  233 million in 1970-71 and 201 million in 1971-72 subject to commitment of not more than80 per cent for 1971-72(b) Prices12.   Officials recommend that Ministers agree to discussions with the gas industry for a financial objective for a period of five years from 1st April    1969, expressed as a net return (i.e. afterdepreciation) on average capital employed.    The options which we ask Ministers to consider are:(i) a net return of 7.0 per cent implying either   a 2.5 per centprice increase in the early months of 1971 and foreseenimprovements in operating efficiency expected by the industry
and inflation at the MTAO rate of 3.3 per cent per annumor no price increase, greater improvements in operatingefficiency and inflation at 3.3 per cent per annum.(ii)    a net return of 7.8 per cent implying a 5.0 per centprice increase in the early months of 1970 and foreseenimprovements in operating efficiency (technologicaland labour) and inflation at the MTAC rate of 3.3 per cent per annum.

Thesefigures were those submitted by the Corporation on thebasis of pre-nationalisation plans only.(2) The figures for 1970-71 and subsequent years are not for specific approval (see below).Analysis of proposed programme(a)    Fixed investment .     The programme is based upon the British Steel CorporationsCorporate Plan now being studied by Departments.   This Plan foreseesa requirement for the Corporation to produce annually between 30 and34 million ingot tons of steel by 1975 compared with a maximum of 25millioningot tons at present.    Since the higher figure implies a considerably higher export level than the industry has achieved in the recentPaat and the feasibility of achieving this needs further study, theprogramme is at present based upon the lower estimate, and willcontinue to be subject to review to the light of further work on thesupply/demand ratio which Departments are at present conducting.2-     The programme is necessarily, by and large, since the Corporationthemselves have yet to firm up their own proposals.   Outline provision\a included for projects on which strategic decisions are required inthe near future, viz. developments at Scunthorpe ( 139 million) now theobject of detailed consideration by Departments,    the development
of plate and section capacity at Teeside ( 35 million),an ore terminal at Redcar ( i5 million) the next stage of wide stripmill development, and the development of an electric ore meltinggtiop in the scrap arising belt.   The Corporation also envisage invest-Bent to expand and modernise capacity for flat products, billets]and re-rolled products costing about  364 million.   Details of these projects have not been submitted by the Corporation but they areexpected to include important schemes for expansion and cose reductionat four of the Corporations wide strip mills and the provision ofanew works for the supply of billets.h,    In addition to plant required to increase capacity, the corporations programme includes considerable investment to reducecosts and to replace obsolescent plant.     In the period up to1975 the Corporation expect to achieve the planned additional outputitith a net reduction of about one quarter of its manpower.(b) Other capital investment; expenditure/requirements4,   Although the Corporation are considering the possibility of invest-nent overseas and aquisitions at home, no provision has been made forthese possibilities, which will need to be subjected to detailed consideration should they arise.   Over the period as a whole  24 million will be required for the repayment of loans associated with theunwinding of obligations taken over at vesting date and not covered bythe general compensation arrangements.    17 million of this will berequired in 1969-70.(c) Financing implications5* At constant prices the Corporation^ programme implies net borrowing from the National Loans Fund as follows:  million1969-70        1970-71        1971-72        1972-73        1973-7438.4 -26 -26 -26 -10But these figures understate the probable borrowing for two reasons.   First, no allowance has been made for the payment of dividends on the  700 million public dividend capital.   These were expected to be of the order of  300 million over the period on thebasis of the Corporations price proposals.   The degree to which this total needs adjustment as a result of the abatement in the price increasescannot be indicated with any certainty. Second, the use of constant prices&quot;afees no allowance for- the inflation of capital and operating costsdeeding the prospective rise in productivity and other savings in*confidential

Officials consider that it is too early to give approval to the levels of expenditure proposed for 1970-71 and 1971-72because the Corporation have not yet reached firm decisions (withthe exception of Scunthorpe and Redcar) on the range of alternativestrategies outlined in the Corporate Plan and because theGovernment has not completed its own review of the Flan.   they also consider that performance in 1968-69, when  66.h million was spent compared with an agreed level of  100 million, together withevidence of under-spending before nationalisation, suggests thatthe Corporation^ proposals for 1969-70 are pitched on the highside.   They, therefore, propose that Ministers should approveexpenditure in the current year of up to  105 million.    This figure includes up to  8 million for initial expenditure on the Scunthorpeproject and other major projects under consideration.   The levelof approval without these projects should be  97 million.   TheMinistry of Power would wish to review this figure in the event ofthe Corporations rate of spending increasing faster than expectedor the need to finance proposed new acquisitions mentioned inparagraph U above.7.     Ministers should also be aware that the Corporation may needat least some price increases in 1970 in order to improve theirpresent very low return on capital   but this possibility is tiedup with the financial objective which has not yet been settled.7-3

Of B0AC*s aircraft already on order, the main expenditure is ontheir twelve Boeing 747a (the &quot;jumbo jets&quot;) for which payments fallfrom a peak of  47.8 million in 1970-71 to  12.7 million in 1972-73.BOAC also provide for progress payments on additional subsonic air-craft for fleet replacement and expansion up to 1977-78; they have assumed capacity equivalent to 31 Boeing 747s, but they have yet todecide on the particular aircraft and they have made no provision for purchase   of Concordes.   Officials accept BOAC1 a assumptions of capacityrequirements, but they consider that there.should be provision forConcordes; with consequent adjustments to the forecasts for otheraibsonle aircraft; it is this which accounts for the differencebetween the fixed assets programme submitted by BOAC and thatrecommended by the Board of Trade.   On either basis it must be
recognised that the forecasts for additional unspecified capacityrequirements are liable to significant variations depending on theaircraft type eventually chosen.2,    With the exception of hotel investment most of the main non-aircraft projects -&apos;hangers, office buildings, equipment and computers -are directly related to the introduction of the jumbo jets and cannotbe deferred without damaging consequences.(b) Financing Implications3.    The greater part of BOAC&apos;s programme entails the purchase of american aircraft which they have so far been required by the Governmentto finance by loans in foreign currencies.   They will not need to borrow from the National Loans Fund until 1973-74 when if they arebuying Concordes their net borrowing requirement might be about 35 million.ko    If BOAC achieve ai return on net assets in the region of the16.U per cent predicted for 1969-70, they will have exceeded theirpresent target, of an average of 12.5 per cent over the four years1966-67 to 1969-70.   They will pay a 1968-69 dividend of  12.5 million to the Exchequer, compared with  10 million for 1967-68.5.    In common with other major airlines BOAC expect an interim period of declining profits, but with Improving prospects from the mid 1970s.    (This ignores any effect on BOAC&apos;s trading results of operating Concordes on which there is Insufficient data currently avail-able to allow calculation of meaningful estimates).Investment options6.    Hotels   BOAC have provided for expenditure of just overmillion, spread over the three years 1969^70 to 1971-72, onhotels in the United Kingdom (although the investment does involve some expenditure on hotels in other European capitals). Of this,about  2 million falls in 1969-70 and a further  2 million in 1970-71.They could be asked to reduce the total of  h.5 million by  1.5 million.If they did, the most likely possibility Is a reduction of about  1 million in 1969-70 and of  0.5 million in 1970-71.
7.    Victoria/Heathrow rail link.   BOAC are partners with BRB, BEAand BAA in a consortium planning to build the terminals to theproposed rail link between Victoria station and Heathrow airport.The four have yet to reach agreement and there are therefore some doubts over the timing of the project.   But in the meantime the bestassumptions are that work on the rail link proper will start in1970-71 and on the terminals in 1971-72;    that the terminals arelikely to cost  12 million and that the four will probably contributeequally (although it must be noted that BOAC&apos;s present view is thatthey would contribute no more than  1 .5 million).   BRB alone willbear the cost of the actual rail link.   If Ministers were to decide that the project as a whole (consortium expenditure and rail link)should be deferred for one year the total reduction in nationalised industries expenditure would be (  million March 1 969 prices):-1 969-70      1 970-71       1971 -72      1972-75      1 97V7h0.5 7.5 1 3(This option is discussed here for convenience;   it is not of course particular to BOAC, although BOAC&apos;s programme would haveto be adjusted to take account of their share of the consequences of any deferment.)recommendations.    It is recommended that, subject to Ministers&apos; decisions on the options noted above and assuming provision for Concorde in theprogramme, approval should be given to expenditure by BOAC on fixed assets in the United Kingdom of  8h.5 million in 1970-71 , and 71.7 million in 1971-72.   Provision for boac&apos;s contribution tothe Victoria/Heathrow link would be specific to that project and nottransferable to the rest of the programme.

The first sees the conclusion in 1973-74 of payments for the 26 Trident 3Bs already approved.The second, starting in 1970-71, is for a new fleet of aircraft ofa type yet to be selected, but for estimating purposes based on28 Trident 3Bs.   There is a risk of a possible underestimate of demand here arising from BEA1 s cautious traffic growth assumptions;accordingly there is no scope for cutting provision for aircraftpurchases for BEA&apos;s main operations.2.    A significant new element in BEA&apos;s programme is BEA Airtours Ltd.set up this year to secure BEA a stake in the package tour market.This wholly-owned subsidiary plans to start operations in 1970 usingsix refurbished Comets from BEA&apos;s existing fleet.   If the ventureprospers, the Comets will need to be replaced after about two years.No evaluation of the proposal can be made until decisions are taken on the air craft type and amount of capacity likely to be needed.Meanwhilev BEA have Included provision in their investment programme -1
on the basis of eight Trident 2s for delivery from 1972-73 to.I973-7U, at a cost of some  18 million, with a peak of nearly 9 million in 1971-72.3,    This provision for BEA Air tours, together with plans for additional freight terminal facilities and computers, accounts inthe main for the increase in forecasts over the 1968 Review.   Theincrease in 1969-70 however results from slippage from theprevious year.   As such shortfalls are a repeated feature of BEAprogrammes the Corporation have this year applied a 10 per centrephasing adjustment throughout.(b)   Financing implicationsI).,    Taking into account the aid provision ( 25 million capitalwrite-off) in the BEA Bill now before the House the forecast netborrowing requirement from the National Loans Fund is ( million at1969-70 outturn prices):-1969-70        1970-71        1971-72        1972-75   1973-7U7.9 30 35 10.8 5.it is possible that BEA will be able to arrange  h.5 million overseasborrowing in 1969-70;    if so their NLF requirement will be reducedaccordingly *Investment options5.    As noted above BEA&apos;s forecasts have already been subjected toa 10 per cent rephasing adjustment to allow for expected shortfallsbut if necessary it would be possible to ask BEA to limit theirfixed assets expenditure to  1 million below the totals foreseen intheir Review in each of the years 1970-71 and 1971-72.   While this&quot;night inhibit BEA*s expansions to some degree officials judge thatit would not be intolerable to the Corporation if presented to themin the context of public expenditure cuts   as a whole.6*    Additionally, BEA might be asked to cut back their proposedinvestment in new aircraft for BEA Airtours Ltd.   If the company&quot;ere to be wound up when the Comets could nol  longer be operated the savings would be  17*9 million spread over the five year   period.9-2
BEA could however reasonably argue that this would be whollycontrary to the Edwards Committee   recommendation that theyshould expand their share of the incltisive tour market.   Analternative would be to ask 3to invest no more than , 12 million in the project which wouid enable them to expand their operationsbut not on the scale now envisaged or not with new aircraft.   Sucha cut would undoubtedly be opposed by BEA but again might seemless unreasonable if the public sector as a whole were being cut.The likely effect of restricting the investment to  12 million would be reductions in BEA&apos;s programme as follows:(  million 1969 prices)1969-70     1970-71      1971-72     1972-73,      1973-740.5 0.8 3.0 1.3 0.4The restriction would reduce BEA&apos;s trading surplus by about  0,3 million in each of the years 1972-73 and 1973-74.7.    Over the three years beginning 1969-70 BEA plan to invest 2.6 million in hotel projects of which  1 .6 million will fall in1970-71 .   They could be asked to reduce this investment by 0.5 million;    it could be assumed thi t most of such a reduction would be made in 1970-71.8.

Subject to Ministers&apos; decisions on the options noted above, itis recommended that approval be given to expenditure by BEA on U.K.fixed assets of  44.5 million in 1970-71 and  48.8 million in1971-72.

For the first time expenditure isdeluded for the early phases of the Third London Airport;   this10-1

Underspending in 1969-70 was largely due to delays on the terminal 3 project.   The forecasts for 1970-71 and 1971-72 appearreasonable, subject to full evaluation of the new projects and tothe options discussed below.   The 1972-73 and 1973-74 forecasts areinevitably more uncertain, and particularly so because of theinclusion of Third London Airport expenditure;   but pending theRoskill Commission&apos;8 recommendations it would be premature toestimate any major change in them.3.    BAA&apos;s investment is profitable.   However, for the first threeyears at least they assume no increase in landing charges andif - as muet be expected - there is cost inflation their grosssurpluses will be reduced somewhat.   Their real rate of return on net assets over the period is between 13 and 1k per cent.   their first target will be negotiated shortly.(b)   Financing implicationsk*    BAA&apos;s net borrowing from the National Loans Fund is forecast( million at 1969-70 outturn prices) at :-1969-70      1970-71       1971 -72     1972-73     1973-7U3.7 3.3 3.3 3.9 5.2Investment options1*    In 1970-71 there are no major projects suitable for defermentbut it should be possible to secure savings of  0.5 million bydeferment of minor projects.   In 1971-72 new major projects (e.g.modification   to Terminal 2;   office and car park development)10-2
could be deferred to give savings of  1 .5 million;    this would lead to an absolute income loss of between  0*5 million and  0.6 million in either 1 973-74 or 1974-75.   If both these options wereexercised BAA&apos;s programme would be reduced to  12.7 million in1970-71 and  13.3 million in 1971-72.6.    An alternative to cutting BAA&apos;s investment would be toincrease its charges, and the Treasury propose that reintroduction of the passenger service charge should be considered.   At 10/-this could bring in about  5 million by 1970-71 .   It wouldeliminate BAA&apos;s borrowing requirement and, unlike landing charges which are already high by international standards, it would not increase the costs of the airlines.   However the Board of Tradestrongly advise against a passenger service charge.   They considerthat BAA&apos;s profits would reach levels indefensibly high in the context of international understandings and relationships;   and thatthe charge would irritate passengers, advance &quot;reporting in&quot; times,add to congestion (especially in the Jumbo-Jet era), and accelerate the need for further terminal building space.   They note thatfor these latter reasons other airports are progressively following the United Kingdom lead in abolishing the charge.7. If it is decided to defer the Victoria/Heathrow rail linkfor one year (BOAC review, Appendix 8 preceding, refers) therewill be a consequential rephasing of BAA&apos;s investment.8.    The option of reducing or deferring expenditure on Turnhouseairport will, as explained above, be decided in the context of thecosted options for BOT civil aviation services (SEP(69)64(Addendum)).recommendations.

It is unlikely that BRB&apos;a Corporate Plan will be ready before1972.   In recognition of the difficulty of investment planning in themeantime they have attempted to restrain their programmes for 1970and 1971.2,   For 1970 they propose  90 million made up of  80 million on&quot;basic projects and  10 million on &quot;highly profitable&quot; projects.Examples of highly profitable projects are some surplus capacityRenewals and schemes for particular customers, such as maiA orderfirms.   The  80 million &quot;basic&quot; programme would be made up ofmillion on optional commercial projects;  23 million on costreduction projects;  25 million on essential renewals; and  18 million0n minor projects proposed by the regions ( 5h million of the programme^ already committed) .   In advance of refining their methods of
investment appraisal BRB can give no precise indication of the returns on these classes of project.   But in general they believe that commercial projects will give a return of at least 15 per cent and cost reduction schemes, including some which count as minor works,a return in excess of 8 per cent and in many cases considerably more.3,    However, BRB expect to spend only  75 million in 1969 and,in discussions with officials, they have been told that in advanceof their Corporate Plan there is no justification in reversing thegeneral downward trend of the last few years by raising their 1 970ceiling over  80 million.   They have accepted this, albeit reluctantly,and said that, within their  80 million they would make way for some oftheir highly profitable projects by deferment of  2-3 million invest-jment on station improvements and telecommunications.   They have also accepted that of the  80 million,  8.4 million should be specificallyallocated to investment on new wagons, and associated equipment andthat this would not be available for other expenditure if the wagoninvestment   1 s not approved.k,   A ceiling of  80 million in 1 970 on this basis (equivalent to 83 million in the Government financial year i 970-71) might be accepted as the &quot;neutral&quot; solution neither providing for investment which theCorporate Plan could show to be unjustified nor cutting the new Board&apos;programme to a level which would prejudge the Plan.    It is, however,open to question whether the  80 million includes some projects whichcould be deferred without undue hardship and accordingly options of reducing the programme to either  75 million or  70 million are put! forward.5.   Investment options for 1 970(i)   A cut of  5 million to  75 millionIf pressed it is likely that BRB could cut a further  5 million from their programme by deferment of expenditureon &quot;essential&quot; renewals ( 25 million), on the renewalelement of their minor works, and possibly on the leastprofitable of their cost reduction projects.   BRB point outthat this would lead to some increase in maintenance costs and to difficulty in maintaining an even work load for their technical departments.   It would also be likely to lead toa slowing down of their programme for the removal of surplus track and signalling capacity, for which theMinistry is currently paying grant; this programme isalready going slower than had originally been planned.These problems are undoubtedly real but they do not in
themselves; appear to add up to an overriding argument against a  5 million cut.(ii)   A\ cut of  10 million to  70 million a radical re-appraisal of the Board&apos;s investment programme would he necessary before any detailed assessment of theeffect of a cut of as much as  10 million could be made.However, BRB are clear that a cut to this level would mean a fundamental change in railways&apos; policy involving the exclusion of much of their non-profitable investment,damage to future prospects and cuts in train speeds andtimetables which would hit in particular the growing Inter-City passenger services.6,    BRB have given no details of their programme   after 1970.   Theyraise investment plans to  95 million in 1971 and then to  130 million in 1972 and 1973 on the assumption that they will then have aCorporate Plan and a firm basis on which to plan ahead.   There is however no evidence at this stage to support such considerableincreases and moreover no reason for supposing that the CorporatePlan will make the case for a rapid expansion of railway activities.It is therefore recommended that for planning purposes investment of 90 million in 1971, and  100 million in both 1972 and 1973 shouldbe assumed (for the Government financial years 1971-72 to 1973-74,this is equivalent to  93 million,  100 million,  100 million,respectively).Financing implications7.    As a result of the provision in the Transport Act 1968 for asubstantial writing down of their capital debt, BRB can forecast a gross trading surplus of  10 million in each of the financial years1969-70 to 1971-72.   Beyond that there can be no certainty but inview of the inadequacy of their present depreciation provision they regard a surplus; in the order of  20 million -  30 million as theirminimum requirement.8.    Assuming investment of  79 million in 1969-70,  83 million int&apos;970-7ii, and  93 million in 1971-72 and the trading surpluses notedabove BRB&apos;s net requirement from the National Loans Fund will be( million 1969 prices).-is impossible to give any meaningful forecast beyond 1971-72*J971-741969-70201970-71271971-7234
Other projectsi.    It is recommended that two projects should be consideredeparately from BRB&apos; s main programme and given specific approvals.Ihey are:-(i)   Transfer of BBB Museum from Clapham to YorkThere is considerable public and Parliamentary interest inthe early move of museum exhibits from Clapham to York wherea new museum will be built at a cost of  0.6 million, anda delay now would enable oppostion to build up still further.The proceeds from the sale of the Clapham site will make this project very nearly self-financing and it is recommended that approval should be given for the expenditure,(li)   Vic tori a/He aithrow Rail LinkBRB are partners in the consortium planning to build theterminals to the proposed Victoria/Heathrow rail link;they will be responsible alone for the expenditure on the link itself.    If it is decided to defer the link for oneyear (BOAC review, Appendix 8 preceding, refers) there willbe a consequential reduction in BRB&apos;a investment in the project of  0.5 million in 1970-71 and  4.5 million in1971-72.recommendations ons10,  It is recommended that approval for 1970 should be of no morethan  80 million and Ministers are invited to consider the alternatives(noted in paragraph 5 above) of  75 million and  70 million.   por1971 it is recommended that BRB should be asked to commit investment of no more than  55 million pending next year&apos;s investment review.It is further recommended that separate approvals should be given tothe museum project and to the Victoria/Heaithrow link which is subject the option of deferment for one year (see paragraph 9 (ii) above).
(a)   Fixed investment2.   The main reasons for increases over the 1968 programme are theprovision of  300,000 for the Fleet Line in 1969; and, in 1970, ofadditional provision for Pimlico Station on the Brixton extension(total cost  700,000) and for the Fleet Line ( 1.8 million as against 1*5 million in the 1968 Review).   Expenditure on the Fleet Line wouldMid up as shown in paragraph 6 below.   There is also a substantial^vision for extending automatic fare collection on the UndergroundRailway in 1970 ( 1.9 million ),   Some of the increases in 1970 areAPPENDIX 12LONDON TRANSPORT BOARD INVESTMENT PROGRAMME i 969^vestment In fixed assets  million at March 1969 pricesgovernment financial years   1969-70   1970-71    1971-72   1972-75   1975-7U(a) 1968 Review 18.9        26.2 -(b) 1969 Review(1) as submitted by board 21.1 28.2(11) as recommendedby Ministry ofTransport 21.1 28.2 - - -Calendar years 1969        1 970        I97j        1972        1975(c) 1968 Review 19.5        25.2 -(d) 1969 Review(i) as submitted by board 21.7        27.4 -(ii) as recommendedby Ministry ofTransport 21.7        27.4 -It is assumed that London Transport will be taken over by the greater london Council on 1st January 1970.

Thefigures include expenditure on the Fleet Line, which has not yet beenapproved.Analysis off proposed programme
offset by savings elsewhere in the programme.   After 1970. apart fromthe Fleet Line, there will he continuing expenditure on the Brixtonextension, automatic fare collection, bus re-shaping and varioussmaller items required for safety and renewals; and in 1973 there is aproposal to begin replacing 1938-49 tube rolling stock at a cost of 9 million in that year.(b) o^her capital investment3.    The Board proposes expenditure of  1.4 million in 1969 and 0.8 million in 1970 on completing their special programme of strengthening covered ways and over line bridges.   This is part of thenational operation to bring the country&apos;s bridges up to the require-ments of modern traffic, and is essential on safety grounds.(c) Financial implicationsIt,    The Board say that their major projects would earn returns of atleast 10 per cent on a DCF basis.   The bus re-shaping programme givesup to 32 per cent and automatic fare collection 20 per cent.   Therealso exists, however, a series of safety and renewals projects whosereturn cannot be calculated in isolation.   The Brixton extension hasbeen approved on social cost benefit grounds, and the Fleet Line will need to be considered on a similar basis.5.    The programme would require borrowings from the National loans fund of  10 million in 1969-70 ( 13.5 million in the calendar year1969) * it being assumed that transfer to the OLC will be effected on1st January 1970.Investment options6*   Expenditure on the Fleet Line is expected to be phased asfollows: -  million1969 1970 1 971 1972 1 9730*3 1.8 3.7 8.9 7.77*    This expenditure represents a large block of uncommittedinvestment.   Final decisions on whether to go ahead with the project,and its timing, will have to be taken in conjunction with the greater london Council, but nevertheless Ministers could, if they considered it essential, postpone this expenditure further.
8,    Some expenditure on the Line would, however, still be needed in1969, 1970 and 1971  to prevent the permanent loss of prospectiveworking sites or to order tunnel linings to keep manufacturers&apos; plantin being, but postponement would produce savings of the followingorder:-  million1222 1221 19.12 1973One year delay 1 .5 2 5 - 1Two year delay 1.5 3 7 UThe Board propose, however, later to extend the line into S.E. London,and delay at this stage would postpone the possibility of relieving bythis means the growing commuter congestion in the area.   further postponement would also endanger the balanced development of public and private transport in London.9.    It is too late in the year to contemplate savings in 1969.   In1970, the only major item of uncommitted expenditure except for theFleet Line is the extension of automatic fare collection; postponement of this would be undesirable because of the high rate of return.   most other items could also be justified individually.   But if Ministers sowished, it would be possible to make an arbitrary reduction of 0,5 million, which would probably be taken up by the postponement ofa series of small projects, though the Ministry of Transport would not feel able to support such a recommendation.Recommendation10.   It is recommended that, subject to ministers decision on the 0.5 million option for 1970 referred to in paragraph 8, the london transport Board&apos;s investment programme for 1969 and 1970 be approvedI as follows:-(i)    on the assumption that the Fleet Line goes forward:-  million1969-70(a) normal programme 19.6(b) covered way programme 1.5Total 21 .1

As noted above the tailing off in 1971 and sub-pent years is considered realistic.Except for safety and welfare projects the Board applies a 10 per centcut-toff &quot;to all proposals and many schemes show an appreciably highere of return.   Because the schemes are for individual customers and carryferent lease or guarantee arrangements, no specific ranking order iscticable.   Similarly postponement is not feasible - either the schemesor they are cancelled.   However, the fact that most schemes are individual customers also means that the rate of return can normallySly be achieved.   This has, indeed, already been demonstrated as ajult of back-checking of existing investments.I Other capital investment the Board is prepared in appropriate cases to acquire furtherlevedoring businesses.   This would be consistent with the policy set outthe Ports White Paper (Cmnd. 3902).   No provision has been made in thegramme but the Ministry of Transport agree that any requirement   for this(for expenditure on safety measures (saf ety - fences, chains, etc.) shouldadditional to ceilings.Financing implicationsThe achievement of the proposed programme would involve borrowing from national Loans Fund as follows&amp; million1969-70     1970-71     1971-72     1972-73     1973-7411.5 4.8 3.1 1.8 1.3represents rather more than half the total finance required in 1969-70,It one-third in 1970-71 and increasingly marginal amounts thereafter,jkalance would be found almost entirely from internal sources (netNrevenue, depreciation, etc.) and investment grants.pmtA optimaThe Board&apos;s prices are kept generally in line with increases in costsp would be inappropriate to offer a price option.

The Board propose as their highest priority investment of  0.2 million a year from 1969 onward in the provision of facilities in the amenitysector, principally marinas, moorings additions to the hire cruiser fleet and a new hire craft base at Banbury.3. There is nothing in the programme for the waterways as such.   Themain proposals for non-amenity investment are in respect of warehousesjand docks, including container handling facilities at Leeds, commercialfleet replacements, and plant and machinery for maintaining and renewingcraft,4. The programme excludes a contingency provision of  200,000 during1969 and  300,000 in 1970 for new offices.5* The Treasury and the Ministry of Transport consider the Board&apos;general approach to be realistic but propose that the increase in invest-ment should be restrained until results are visible.   They therefore14-1

Nil.(c)Financial implications1, No profits are expected from the waterways as such.    Although notyet fully appraised the amenity projects are expected to provide a modest return after servicing the capital required.   The warehouses, etc.investments are expected to bring in a DCF return of from 10 per cent to20 per cent.    Investment in plant will be subject to appraisal techniquesdesigned to produce the highest economic return.   The proposals now recommended are expected to involve borrowing from the National loans fund as follows :-  million-969-70 1970-71 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74: 0.7 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.4Options8.

They have yet todecide the future scale of investment for these new activities, and itfat be accepted, that for 1972 and 1973 in particular the forecasts areTery provisional.    It is therefore proposed this year to set separate^vestment ceilings for each of the four main activities rather than afiling for the NFC as a whole.16- appendix 16NATIONAL FREIGHT CORPORATION INVESTMENT PROGRAMME.  1969investment in fixed assets
Road haulage subsidiaries. Road haulage investment is basedmainly on vehicle replacement, fleet expansion and depot reorganisation.Vehicle replacement policy was agreed with the THC in 1965 whenrevised vehicle lives were adopted which gave a high return in terms ofaaintenance costs savings.   The Ministry of Transport have asked NFC; to back-check on the savings actually achieved before the 1970 vehiclereplacement programme is submitted for approval.   Provision for fleetexpansion assumes some increase in total traffic and an increase inIfPC!8 share of the market, in part at the expense of operators whowill be hit harder by the new safety regulations and by qualitylicensing and in part from new consultancy and contract services for large customers.    This, together with some increase in the replacementprogramme, has led to a small overall increase over last year inforecast investment for road haulage which officials accept.   Assumingprice increases keep pace with inflation NFC expect road haulagepre-tax profits to rise from  7 million in 1969 to  10 million in 1971.;But they add that, if they continue to be subject to a greater degree ofcontrol under the Prices and Incomes policy than the private sector ofthe industry, this forecast rise in profits might be cut back by up to 2 million a year,3.   Shipping companies. It is declared Government policy that thereshall be coordination of the shipping activities of BRB and NFC and themeans of achieving this are currently under review.   In the meantime,there is little prospect of making Associated Humber Lines Ltd. viableand no investment is proposed for it, thus reducing last year*s forecasts!for shipping.    The outlook for the Atlantic Steam Navigation Ltd. is somewhat brighter and, subject to the review of the Company&apos;s future, anew ship will be built in 1972.   The proposed ceilings include someinvestment in essential facilities (e.g. roll-on/roll-off terminals)iffhich will he required irrespective of the future ownership of theCompany.^   National Carriers Limited. National Carriers Ltd.  (formerlyAlways&apos; sundries) are losing heavily but the loss of  26 million in1967 has been reduced to  20 million in 1968 and Is forecast at16-2
 17 million, in 1969* as an incentive to loss elimination a sundriesgrant will be paid until 1973.    But NFC are on notice that until there is evidence that the strategy adopted is proving successful in reducing the deficit at an acceptable rate, further investmentwill not be authorised.   This strategy is based on the belief that thepresent network of 200 depots (reduced by BRB from 1000) can be madeyiable without further cuts, that traffic can be recaptured byimproved quality of service9 and that charges can be increased fromsubstandard levels0    It would however be premature to pronounce ona!CL&apos;s future until nfc have had time to shape their policy and toexamine the report to be made later this year by the Freight IntegrationCouncil on the rationalisation of parcels and sundries.5.    Freicdxtliners Limited. NFC forecast a  36.6 million requirement for Freight liners Limited over the five year period (this includesBI(B&apos;s u10 per cent contribution).    It is recommended that investment should be approved to enable completion of the first two stages of the network already approved ( 13 million) and that no provision should bemade for further extensions until NFC have made the case by a detailedappraisal of the prospects, with evidence that Stages I and II willbe profitable.    (A loss is likely for 1969 the size of which will depend largely on the charges for rail haulage now being negotiated.)This is the source of the difference between the programme proposed byNFC and that recommended by the Ministry of Transport.    It should berecognised however that subsequent appraisals might justify some additional investment beyond Stage II.^   127J.jmd-afJier9 NFC themselves stress that until they can review their new undertakings in depth their forecasts for the later years musth uncertain.    Subject to this important reservation, and to adjustments to take out NFC&apos;s provision for expansion of freight liners Limitedbeyond Stage II, the forecasts for 1971 to 1973 are acceptable.p) Qlh^r^eanjta 1 investment7&apos;   A notional figure of  5 million per annum is allowed foracquisition of new undertakings.   These would represent a transferpom the private to the public sector, with no additional call on realsources, and as such would not count against the fixed assetsprogramme.   But they would lead to a call on the National Loans Fund
na a moratorium or limit could therefore he placed on them.    This would however he contrary to declared Government policy (Cmnd. 3U70paragraph 21) that the new undertakings should seek every opportunityto acquire new businesses.(c)  Financing implications8,,    Taking into account the effect of reducing their provision forPreightliners Ltd. by  21+ million over the period, NFC&apos;s net borrowing requirement from the National Loans Fund (at   million 1969/70 outturn prices) Is;-1262=20.     1210=21     1221=22     m^zU     i975-7^18 16 7 7 -lavestment options9,    The 1970 programme is already cut near to the bone and the onlyoption which is noted is the moratorium on new acquisitions (seeparagraph 7 above) which, if exercised, would require a reversal ofGovernment policy,HecpMend a.t i ons10,   Investment in fixed assets is recommended as follows:-	1969-	1970	1221Road Haulage Company	16.8	17.6	15.5Shipping Companies	0.2	0.7	0.7National Carriers Limited	6.5	7.5	6.1Freightliners Limited	8.5	3.4	1.1NFC Total	32.0	29.2	23.4

Comparable figures for the 1968 review are not,therefore, available.Analysis of proposed programme(a)  Fixed investment3.    The National Bus Company operates through a network of subsidiary companies and its overall programme is the aggregate of the plans ofthese various companies.   Approximately three quarters of the investment would be in buses and coaches, the figures for the three years to 1971being: -  million1969 1970 19719.2 11.0 11.9The 1970 figure is 10 per cent lower than that originally submitted byseme of the individual companies.   This reduction has been made as a17- appendix 17NATIONAL BUS OOMPANY INVESTMENT PROGRAMME 1 969stment in fixed assets
holding action pending a fuller review of the optimum &quot;bus life whichcould, of course, lead to the conclusion that increased investment isrequired in 1971  and subsequently.^    The balance of the programme is for land and buildings, plant and machinery.    The building projects up to 1 971 are already in the pipeline, chiefly bus stations and garages, none costing more than some  250,000.    UO0,000 in 1970 and  300,000 in 1971 are for thepurchase of plant for the Company&apos;s two manufacturing subsidiaries,British Commercial Vehicles Limited and Eastern Coach Works Limited.5.    The figures for fixed assets include provision for the Londoncountry bus and coach services which it is assumed will be taken over -from the London Transport Board on 1st January 1970.    Provision is madefor expenditure on vehicles of  1.2 million in 1970 and a notional 1 million a year thereafter.    The 1970 programme includesS,0,k million for vehicles delivered late in respect of the tons 1969investment programme.   The National Bus Company say that the age andcondition of the country bus fleet is such that they envisage embarking on an accelerated programme of renewals after 1970: but they are notyet in a position to forecast the rate of investment.6.    The Bus Company also expect that there will be deficits on theoperation of these services of  0.7 million in 1970 and  1.2 million in1971.   They say that these losses cannot be covered entirely fromsurpluses made by the other companies of the National Bus Company, andthat investment in the country bus services will therefore have to be financed from the National Loans Fund.   But they also point out that until they have assumed control of these activities they cannotforecast what economies, if any, they could make by rationalisationin order to reduce these losses.(0)  Other capital investment7-     0.5 million has been included by the Company in their programme for 1969 for acquisitions of shareholdings in other companies or of bus assets.   It would seem more realistic, however, in view of negotiations with a number of municipal authorities, that a notionalProvision of   around  1 million a year should be made to cover the
cost of acquisitions.   Any such expenditure would probably involveborrowing.(c)   Financial implications8,    The Company is at present viable; it is expected that any increases in recurrent costs can be met from fare increases.    None ofthe proposals in the programme of fixed investment would involveborrowing from the National Loans Fund except in respect of therequirements of the London country bus services.    The provision of 1 million a year for acquisitions would, however, probably involveborrowing up to the amount actually spent on acquisitions.    Totalborrowings from the National Loans Fund might therefore be  million1969-70   1970-71    1971-72   1972-73   1973-7U2 2 2 2 2Options(a) Prices9.    Given the independence of the Traffic Commissioners, who controlbus fares, it is not entirely appropriate to express options in termsof price rises rather than cuts in investment.   But the Commissionersare normally ready to grant fares increases to cover genuine additionalcosts which cannot be absorbed and such increases, being local bynature, are unlikely to give rise to political embarrassment.(b) Investment10.   If cuts of the order of 10 per cent were required in 1970 and 1971there would be severe repercussions.   A cut-back in vehicle replacementon top of the arbitrary cut made by the Company would necessitatecancellation of orders already placed for delivery of buses in 1970and provisionally for 1971.    It would be completely contrary to theintention of the 25 per cent bus grant recently introduced, would slowdown the introduction of one-man bus operation which is producing highreturns for the industry and would raise operating costs possibly byan amount greater than the cuts.   Of the remaining capital investmenta good deal consists of extension and adjustment to buildings to conform with legislation and meet changing conditions and to purchasecomputers and accounting machines to combat labour shortages.17-3

capital investment policy particularly on the shipping side which only came within the purview of the Group&apos;s management at thebegining of 1969*   On the bus side the Group inherited no scientificassessment of optimum bus life though they hope to make progress withthis during the current year.   Their future programme must, therefore,be regarded as tentative.   All programmes in this review are inheritedfrom previous managements.3,   Buses.   Most buses to be acquired in 1969 and later will be suitable for one-man operation although progress towards one-manworking will depend on trade union co-operation, which is slow inevolving.   The substantial increase in investment (from about  2 million in 1969-70 to  3 million in 1970-71 ) is mainly attributable toreplacement needs of the undertakings to be acquired although some provision is made for reducing the overall age of the vehicles in service to not less than 15 years. The Group also wishes to replace buseson the express London to Glasgow and Edinburgh routes, which are highly profitable but need to offer up to date vehicles, every six years.k&apos;   Ships *   The figures submitted by the Group provided for two large&apos;roll-on, roll-off car-ferry type vessels for use on the Clyde in1969 and 1970 respectively.   It is now unlikely that the second vesselwill be acquired before April 1972 and no firm date can be given.There will, therefore, be a saving of  750,000 in 1970-71 and, whilethe second vessel has not been given a place in the programme thisyear, suitable provision may need to be made in a subsequent review for acquisition sometime from 1972-73 onwards.   Most of the remainingproposals for 1969-70 to 1971-72 are to pay for a new ship alreadyjon order to serve Islay (D. MacBrayne Ltd.), and car ferries for Kyleof Lochalsh (Caledonian Steam Packet Company ) which will be highlyprofitable.   The projects for the later years are more speculative atI the present stage.P*   Land and buildings.     The programme includes  1.2 million inJ1969-70 tailing off to  375,000 in 1973-7U, mainly for new bus depotsworkshops and piers.   The Scottish Development Department considersI the proposals for 1969-70 and 1970-71 to be over- ambitious and has18-2
proposed that they should be replaced by an average  750,000 a year over the period.(to)    Other capital investmentge     8.2 million is included in 1969-70 for the acquisition ofcontrol of D. MacBrayne Ltd. ( 500,000), and the Dundee and Glasgowmunicipal bus undertakings ( 700,000 and  7 million respectively).The timing of the first two acquisitions is fairly firm but the thirdis much more tentative.(c)    Financing implications7.    The MacBrayne and Dundee acquisitions would be financedinternally.   Although the resource implications are minimal and thereare some as yet unresolved queries about the take-over price, the glasgow acquisition would involve borrowing of the order of  7 million from the National Loans Fund, which would, however, be offset by a comparable debt repayment by the Glasgow municipality.Options(a) Prices8.   Given the independence of the Traffic Commissioners it would be unrealistic to offer any price options.   It is assumed that fareincreases sufficient to offset increased working cost will be approved.   If not serious financing problems could arise.(h)  Investment9.   Only about  0.25 million of the proposed traffic vehiclereplacement for 1970-71 is still uncommitted.   A reduction of this order would mean that out of a total replacement programme of 300ahout l+o fewer buses would be replaced, half of them from theprofitable Glasgow-Edinburgh and London routes.   Although only: 250 buses have been replaced each year during the past two years,18-confidential
Group considers that this has been inadequate and would prefercut back in other directions if necessary.Apart from the agreed deletion of provision for the secondjjjrde Perry in 1970-71 no reduction can be justified at thi3 stage the proposed investment in ships.Apart from essential provision of piers the proposals for newiilding construction are much more flexible and although delays inlie replacement of dilapidated depots and workshops might give rise toerational difficulties and public criticism, the Group consider that[is is where the bulk of any severe reductions would have to be made.I, It is considered that, if Ministers decide that it is necessaryffo impose a reduction in the investment proposals over and above the1750,000 already agreed in respect of the ship for the Clyde in 1970-71 *he most appropriate action would be to reduce the provision for969-70 by  0.2 million and that for each of the years 1970-71 and971-72 by  0.5 million.le commendation3, It is recommended that the Scottish Transport Group&apos;s investment programme should be approved as follows for the years 1969-70 to1971-72 and that the tentative figures for 1972-73 and 1973-7h be noted:  milliongovernment financial year   1 969-70h.3	h.2	h.1	5.0	h.61969	1970	1?7V	1?72	19733.9	h.3	h.3	h.7	h.8jtt u Ministers decide that it is necessary to take up the optionsttered in paragraph 12 the figures would be:-tesent financial WAR   1 969-70   1 970-71    1 971 -72   1972-73   1973-7hh.1 3.7 3.6 5.0 h.61969 1970        19,71        1972        19733.7 3.8 3.8 h.7 h.81
