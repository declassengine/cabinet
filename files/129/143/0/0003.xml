IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 78 COPY NO.8th July, 1969CABINETPAY OF THE HIGHER CIVIL service memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Ninth Report of the Standing Advisory Committee on the pay of the Higher Civil Service attached to C(69) 65 recommends the followingincreases:-- ,                                   Present        Recommended .Grade                                  &quot;-        ---r:-     Increase- pay Pay -    %Under Secretary 5, 500 6, 750 22, 7Deputy Secretary 6, 300 9,000 42.9Permanent Secretary 8,600 14.000 62.8Head of the Civil Service     )Permanent Secretary to the ) 2QQ ,000 QTreasury )Secretary of the Cabinet      )2,       The Report explains that these increases are appropriate to thecircumstances of raid-1969r- but recommends, on the assumption that theGovernment may find it necessary to stage such large increases, thatthey should be paid in three instalments.    The first, to be given on1st July, 1969, would be limited, subject to rounding, to the maximumallowed under the annual incomes policy ceiling since pay was lastadjusted in September, 1965 (13,4 per cent).    The balance would bepaid in two equal instalments on 1st July, L970, and 1st July, 1971(Annex),3.       The annual cost of these recommendations, including consequential increases for other senior civil servants whose pay is linked or related tothat of these grades, would be about  600, 000 for the first instalment and 1. 75 million in total.    The Report also recommends that any 1969 centralpay increase for Administrative Class Principals should be extended to
the Assistant Secretary grade which is within the ambit of the higher civil Service, but is not otherwise covered by the Committee!srecommendations.    The recently agreed central pay settlementgave the Principal grade a 5 per cent increase.    The cost of extendingthis to Assistant Secretaries would be about  850, 000 a year.4.       The Committee justify their recommendations as follows(paragraph references are to its Report):-(i)  They are necessary on even a modest interpretation of thelfair comparison1 principle enunciated by the Priestley Commission andrecently reaffirmed in the Fulton Report (paragraphs 7-9, 30-31).(ii)  They satisfy the criterion of the White Paper which permitsincreases within the ceiling &quot;where there is widespread recognition that the pay of a certain group of workers has fallen seriously out of line with the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in thenational interest to be improved&quot; (paragraph 34),(5ii)   They are necessary in order to maintain the quality of theHigher Civil Service in the longer term (paragraph 31);  and to facilitatemobility between the Civil Service and other employment (paragraph 32).(iv)  They constitute an essential drawing out of the pay differentialsat the most senior levels both to reflect relative responsibilities(paragraph 33) and to permit the reorganisation of the grading structureat these levels- and the introduction of a system of pay ranges as recommended in the Fulton Report (paragraphs 16-18),    They thereforerepresent a major reorganisation of the salary structure to promoteproductivity and efficiency (paragraph 36).Views of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes5,       On 10th June the Committee considered my proposal to accept,subject to staging, the recommendations in the Plowden Report, whichI regarded as justifiable in themselves and as consistent with incomes policy.    The Committee decided that, although the proposal to give theHigher Civil Service from 1st July, 1969, the Stage 1 increases recommendded by the Plowden Committee as a first instalment was not objectionable,they could not endorse the recommendations as a whole without furtherconsideration and, if possible, the provision of more material in supportof the arguments advanced by the Plowden Committee,    i was therefore asked to consult Lord Plowden informally to see what further informationhe could offer and to report back to the Committee.6.      I accordingly saw Lord Plowden on 11th June and with hieagreement I also discussed the Report with another member of theCommittee,. Mr. Clapham of ICI,    In general Lord Plowden took theline that the recommendations in his Report were firmly based on thev/ide variety of evidence available to his Committee and represented
its considered judgment.     The following answers to the main criticismsraised in the PI Committee emerged from these discussions.The alleged lack of detailed argument7.       The R.eport of the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI)on Top Salaries had itself provided the Plowden Committee with much ofthe information it required about outside rates and levels of responsibilityboth in private industry and the nationalised industries.     The committee made in addition a number of enquiries of its own.    Its main job was torecommend appropriate Civil Service rates from this data.    This is nota process which can be analysed and justified step by step any more thanthe NBPI was able to prove the Tightness of its recommendations for nationalised board salaries.     The Ninth Roport is in fact far more detailed and closely argued than any of its predecessors.Recruitment and retention8.       The Committee did net overlook this factor which is coveredadequately in paragraph 31 of its Report.Restructuring9,       It waa suggested that the recommendations could not be justified as a restructuring.    But the proposals do not purport to constitute arestructuring in themselves.    It is the task of my Department torestructure the Higher Civil Service (and work on important interimproposals to this end is already well advanced).    But the proposed new rates do represent a pulling out of the differentials which isnecessary if the future structure of the Higher Civil Service is to reflect relative responsibilities and to permit a rational regroupingof new rates into broad salary ranges within which pay can be related to performance.     The restructuring aspects of the Plowdenrecommendations are at least as genuine as most other proposalswhich have been accepted as justified under incomes policy, on theground that they involve improvements of structure.    This includes the NBPI&apos;s own proposals for nationalised industries.The use of comparability10.       The Plowden Report specifically denies (paragraph 9) that its recommendations are based on generalised comparability ** &quot;,, , \7.ehave not relied upon a generalised comparison or an automatic formula,but have made specific evaluations of the rates being paid for jobs ofrecognisably similar character and at similar levels of responsibility&quot;.In doing so the Committee relied heavily on the NBPPs own Report on top Salaries, which did much of its fact-finding and evaluation for it.Obviously, in the last aaialysis job comparison at this level cannot beprecise.    But there is no reason to suppose that the Committee hasunduly favoured the Civil Service, or has been insufficiently thorough
in the way it drew the comparisons.    On the contrary, it was clear from my talk with Mr, Cl?.pham that the Committee would have recommendedeven higher rates had it not taken account of the constraints within whichthe Government must operate.    The rates recommended by the NBPIfor nationalised board Chairmen and members were designedly less .than those at comparable levels in private industry.    hi turn, Plowdenrecommended  14, 000-S15, 000 for Permanent Secretaries, comparedwith the NBPI rate of  20,000 for Group A Chairmen.11.       It is in any case very difficult to see what other basis theCommittee could have adopted for its recommendations so long ascomparability is accepted as the main basis for determining CivilService pay in accordance with the principles laid down by the PriestleyRoyal Commission and recently reaffirmed by the Fulton Committee.Certainly no-one has been able to dovise a satisfactory alternativesystem.    This question is being studied by officials and can be considered further in the light of their report.    In the meantime, it would be inconsistent with our commitment to the Civil Service as a whole toallow objections to comparability on grounds of general principle to influence the Governments attitude to the Plowdon Report.Possible reference to the NBPI12.       This Committee left open the possibility of referring the Plowdenrecommendations.    This course has obvious attractions, since whateverrecommendations emerged (and they might be little different from thepresent ones) they would bear the same stamp of incomes policy approvalas the rates which have been accepted for national board Chairmen and members, so that the presentational difficulties inherent in such large increases for the Governments own employees would be minimised,Howevor, there arc strong arguments against a reference to the Board.It was reasonable enough to have referred the Franks Report of 1965,because at the time the NBPI had only just been sot up as a now instrument of incomes policy and was clearly a case for submitting to its scrutiny the findings of a pre-existent committee under a Chairman of long standing.But Lord Plowdcn was appointed only last summer with a specific job todo, which he has now done.    The time to have referred Higher CivilService pay, if at all, would have been prior to or as an alternative tothe appointment of a successor to Lord Franks.    Moreover, Lord Plowdenaccepted the appointment on the assumption (though he was, of course,given no assurances) that any report he made would not be referred,    Ihave no doubt that if his present recommendations were so treated, heand most of his colleagues would resign and would feel obliged to explaintheir reasons publicly.    He and, even more forthrightly, Mr, Claphainhave indeed made this plain to me.    We should not underestimate theawkwardness this would create, nor the degree of sympathy they mightcommand from informed public opinion,CON Fl DENTS AL
13,       It can, of course, be argued that this type of review body is nolonger the appropriate way of handling this kind of problem and that the nbpi is the obvious instrument.    But, in my view, any move towardsnew arrangements for determining Higher Civil Service pay should bemade as part of a deliberate and declared policy which would have totake account also of the Kindersley Review Body, and not as a reaction to a particular report,,    It is very likely that the National Staff Side asa whole would react very strongly to any threat to a continued existenceof the Plowden Committee, in the absence of any agreement on what should take its place.14.       Finally, in the event of a reference, the NBPI might considerit necessary to take into consideration questions affecting the structure and organisation of the Higher Civil Service.    This could well confusethe already difficult job of taking action on the Fulton recommendations,such action is, as Ministers well know, already well advanced on a wider front,Likely reaction in the Higher Civil Service15,      I was also asked by the PI Committee to advise on the likelyreactions of the Higher Civil Service to a reference.    These are, ofcourse, difficult to assess,    I am sure there would be general recognitionof the need to contain the repercussions so far as possible,    I am alsosure that most senior civil servants would not expect the Plowdenrecommendations to be implemented in full and at once.    At thesame time, there would, I am sure, be widespread dismay if, asthe virtually certain result of the reference, Lord Plowden resignedand his Committee ceased to exist.    Even so, it is just possible thatthis might be accepted if it were the Governments avowed policy to doaway with independent review bodies as such.    But the Kindersley review body would remain - having survived so far, it would be noted, thepublication of a report which was regarded by some as contrary toincomes policy, was certainly in conflict v/ith the NBPI interpretation of the policy, but was nevertheless accepted by the Government withouta reference.16.      I think therefore that a reference would have a bad effect onmorale mainly because it would appear to be discriminatory.    Itwould also cause dismay at the thought that another outside body wasto have the opportunity of restructuring the Civil Service at a time when we are well launched on major tasks in the light of Fulton.17,       More generally, I am sure that failure to act at least over aperiod to implement the Plowden recommendations could unquestionablyhave serious implications.    There is already a certain amount of movement out of the Civil Service into industry.    Whereas this isnot necessarily a bad thing, there is, I believe, a real danger, despite the dedication of the Higher Civil Service, that we should begin to lose
a number of good people without any return movement,    I have heard ofcases of civil servants in various senior ranks being considered for postsat very much higher pay in industry and in public bodies, especially thelocal authorities.Consequential increases and repercussions.18,       The salaries of the Lower Judiciary have been linked with corresponding Civil Service rates in the range Deputy Secretary/Assistant Secretary,    They will therefore need to be reviewed in thelight of decisions on the Civil Service rates, and corresponding Stage 1increases will have to be given from 1st July, 1969,   Some of thesesalaries can only be changed by Order requiring an affirmative resolution of both Houses, and if the implementation of Stage 1 is agreed and announced, the Lord Chancellor hopes to lay these Orders in timeto bring them into effect before the Recess (these salaries cannotbe increased with retrospective effect).19,       The salaries of the most senior officials in the National health service, which are linked to Civil Service rates in the range UnderSecretary/Assistant Secretary, will also be affected.    There arealso some staff at this level in &quot; binge bodies&quot;, e, g, the atomic energy Authority, whose pay follows Civil Service rates.    although there is no direct link, the decision on higher Civil Service rates islikely to have an influence on the determination of rates for the mostsenior local government officials.    in considering repercussions ofthis kind we shall need to ensure that the case for passing on similarincreases is examined with the greatest: possible care,20,      At Stage 2 (1st July, 1970) the top salaries in the Lov/er Judiciaryrange will be pressing so closely on the salaries of High Court Judgesthat a review for the Higher Judiciary will have to be considered.    Atthat stage also the question of reviewing also the salaries of Membersof Parliament and of Ministers would arise.21,       There v/ould, of course, be a logical case for referring theserepercussions to the NBPI, but there are obvious political difficulties to such a course.    Moreover, there are strong arguments againstraising the question of the pay of Ministers and Members of parliament at all if this can be avoided^,Conclusions22.      I am fully persuaded that sooner or later we shall have to acceptthe proposed new salary rates for the Higher Civil Service and that itwould in fact be right to do so.    The Plov/den recommendations can be defended as consistent with incomes policy in the light particularly of the nbpi Report on Top Salaries, the acceptance of which by the Governmenthas disposed in advance of most of the presentational difficulties,
23.      For the reasons given in paragraphs 13 and 14 abmre, we shouldnot refer all or part of the Plowden recommendations to the NBPI,    Andwe must, if we are to avoid serious consequences for the morale.and efficiency of the Civil Service, treat higher civil servants at least no worse than the Chairmen and members of nationalised industries.24.      The problem therefore is how far we can meet these important considerations without raising prematurely the question of the salaries of the Higher Judiciary, Ministers and Members of Parliament.25.      The formula we adopted in the case of nationalised board salarieswas that the Government accepted the new rates in principle and also theproposed Stage 1 increases, but would consider the further increases inthe light of the development of incomes policy over the next tv/o years.The difficulty here is that incomes policy as such is in fact unlikely to rule out the second and third stages of these increases on 1st April, 1970,and 1st April, 1971.    To adopt the same formula for the Higher CivilService would not therefore avoid the possibility of wider repercussionsat Stage 2 on 1st July, 1970.    But 1 think that this is not really a difficulty.It would be a mistake to regard the Plowden recommendations as the soleor indeed the prime cause of these wider repercussions.    In fact theFirst Secretary and I pointed out in our joint memorandum (C(69) 33)that the recommendations in the NBPI Report on Top Salaries would -have repercussions on the pay of the Higher Civil Service and perhapsalso the Higher Judiciary, Ministers and Members of Parliament.    TheHigher Civil Service thus occupies a middle position in a chain of whichthe NBPI Report was the first link.26.      It would be reasonable therefore to treat the nationalised industries and the Higher Civil Service exactly alike in relation to the repercussions in other areas.    In other words, we should adopt the same formula for both leaving open for decision later this year or early next when to implement the second stage increases in both casets in the light notonly of incomes policy but also of general policy, including repercussions in other areas.    I very much hope that further deferment would not benecessary in either case.    But I think that the postponement of the second stage of Civil Service increases beyond 1st July, 1970, would have no chance of acceptance by either senior civil servants or the national staff Side, except as part of a policy decision affecting equally the nationalised industries.Recommendation27.      I recommend therefore that the Government should accept theproposed new Civil Service rates in principle;  agree to implement from 1st July, 1969, the first stage increases recommended by Lord Plowdenand also the proposed 5 per cent central pay increase for assistant secretaries;  and announce that consideration will be given to the further increases in the light of the development of incomes policy over the next two years.    This would be on the understanding, which would not be made
public, that Stage 2 of the Plowden increases would be deferred beyond1st July, 1970, only to the extent that Stage 2 of the nationalised industryincreases was also deferred beyond 1st April, 1970j and that in reaching a decision on both regard would be had to all the rrelevant factors includingthe possible repercussions.28.      This i-ecommendation v/as approved by the PI Committee on 8th July although it was agreed that further consideration of the general problems raised by public service pay would also be necessary.    TheChairman of the Committee will report the outcome cf the Committee&apos;discussion to the Cabinet.S.Civil Service Department, S.W.1.8th July, 1969
