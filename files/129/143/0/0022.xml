NOTES(a) The reduction in the Defence Budget is subject to confirma-tion by the Secretary of State for Defence of the practi-ability of achieving a small part of the reduction.(b)  5 million of the  12 million reduction for England relates to local authority current expenditure on roads which isnot subject to direct central Government control.     Whiletherefore it may not be possible to ensure that this reduction is secured, it is included in the total reductionfor roads, as agreed, on the understanding that every possible pressure will be applied to persuade localauthorities to make it.(c) The Secretary of State for Scotland has authority to changejin agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ thedistribution between these various programmes of thetotal reductions agreed for Scotland.(d) The Secretary of State for Wales has authority to change,in agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, thedistribution between these various programmes of thetotal reductions agreed for Wales.(e) The Minister of Housing and Local Government undertakes areduction of  h7 million as his share in this total.Expenditure on housing and environmental services inEngland may fall below this reduced level but this cannot be firmly predicted.     The level of expenditureon housing and relating- programmes will be one of the factors to be taken into account when the time comes todecide how far funds shall be committed, within a ceiling of  55 m.. for local authorities&apos; mortgages for housepurchases in 1970-71.(f) Within the total reduction of  20.3 m. net in health and welfare expenditure in England,  9m, is attributed to charges for hospital treatment in all car accident cases,and the practicability of producing the  9 m. in this wayis being further examined by the Secretary of State forthe Social Services with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Transport.(g) The reduction of  6 m. in school building minor works inEngland and Wales is suggested in the expectation thatit can be made in ways that would not affect the numbersof teachers employed.(h) The provision included in the Survey for implementingrecommendations of the Pulton Report is:-The Treasury have proposed reduced levels of expenditure:-(j)    There are strong reasons for obtaining a reduction from northern Ireland and at least  6m. is being sought fromthis source.1970-71 m.9.h31971-72 m.13.696.0 9.0The Civil Service Department have offered to reduce theprovision to:-6.51 9.0
