C(69) 92 COPY NO.     6821st July. 1969CABINETCOMMEPvCIAL- SUPERSONIC FLYING AND AIRPORT NOISEOF CONCORDENote by the Pre&amp;ident of the Board of TradeI attach, for the information of my Cabinet colleagues, amemorandum which was considered by the Home Affairs Committee on commercial supersonic flying and airport noise of Concorde.    The issues raised are of some relevance to the cabinet consideration of theproposals for Concorde Test Routes, put forward in the lord Chancellor&apos;smemorandum (C(69) 87).C.A.R.C.Board of Trade, S.W.1.21st July, 1969CO Mi FIDE INITIAL
COMMERCIAL SUPERSONIC FLYING AND AIRPORT NOISE OF CONCORDE1.     I have frequently drawn the attention of my colleagues tothe problem of Concorde noise, but it has so far been decidedthat this problem should be subsumed under the wider problem ofobtaining sufficient airline orders.     However,  in view of dis-cussion on Concorde&apos;s test routes (which this paper does not directly affect),  I now think it right to raise in some detail the question of a ban on or regulation of supersonic flightsover the United Kingdom,  and the further question of Concorde&apos;sengine noise.Banning commercial supersonic flying2.     There is already much evidence both in this country andabroad to demonstrate that supersonic bang is offensive to widesectors of the population.      This is likely to remain the casedespite any public enthusiasm for Concorde and regardless ofthe particular acoustical characteristics of Concorde&apos;s bang.In the United Kingdom, with our dense population,  there is a clear need to protect the quality of life from further pollutiongenerally and in particular from distress caused by aircraft.Objections to noise from existing subsonic aircraft is growing,as witnessed,  for example, by Parliamentary interest and corres-pondence and   much of the protest movement against a Third london airport.      It is my judgment that sooner or later (and in any case before any SST comes into airline service) the Government willhave to ban supersonic commercial flights over the United Kingdom.Timing of a decision3.     The first factor affecting the timing of a decision and itsannouncement is the need to plan ahead for the Air Traffic Controlfacilities needed for Concorde both nationally and internationally.Arrangements must be made in advance regarding routes on either side of the United Kingdom and experience shows that even techni-cal international discussions of this sort cannot be accomplishedswiftly.     Assuming there is no further slippage of Concorde&apos;stimetable it will be necessary to have reached a decision in thiscountry regarding supersonic overflying,  and to make it known toa number of different authorities, before the summer of 1970.1
4.      The second, consideration of timing is the possible effectof an announcement on airline orders for Concorde.     Beforeairlines firm up on real orders for Concorde they will have totake a view on,  among many other considerations,  the likelyattitude of countries on possible routes towards supersonicoverflying.      Supersonic flight may well be banned by advancedand populous countries such as the United States and Germanyand this is also likely to hold true for other countries that have no direct interest in supersonic aircraft or air services.The most that can be hoped for is that some countries whoseairlines and travellers may have an influence in favour ofsupersonic and whose territory includes very thinly populatedroutes (such as northern Canada) may allow supersonic overflying.But discussions with countries which might be brought to permitsupersonicsoverflying will take time and from that point of view the sooner they can start the better.      They cannot begin inearnest until we are able to show our own hand.5.      For air traffic control reasons, if for no others, it isnot possible to defer our own decision until after airlineshave placed their initial orders for Concorde which is most unlikely to be before the second half of next year.     their decisions will therefore inevitably be taken in the knowledgeof our decision.      In the matter of timing therefore the onlyissue is what course will best assist in discussions with othercountries.     My preference is for an announcement this year.6.      There are also domestic considerations.      A decision infavour of supersonic test flights over the United Kingdom make sit necessary to restrict any legal rights of redress that thepublic now has,  in respect of nuisance or trespass regardingthese flights,  in order to avoid the risk of having to haltthem in consequence of actions in the courts.      The Law officers have expressed a clear preference for basic legislation to givethe Crown the necessary protection.      The alternative course of taking action by Order may encounter difficulties since it wouldbe subject to negative resolution in either House.     But which-ever course is followed we shall be pressed very strongly to declare our hand in public on commercial supersonic flying.We are, in effect,  taking  away  rights at a time when publicopinion is anxious to see further safeguards against noise.A quid pro quo will be expected.    My judgment is that a banon commercial supersonic overflying should be announced at latest when an Order is made or legislation introduced to givecover for Concorde&apos;s supersonic test flights,  i.e. in September/October.Airport noise7.      I am advised that present estimates of Concorde noise levelsare subject to wide margins of error.      These margins areexpected to be narrowed as information from flight tests becomes available, but on the basis of present programmes a significant reduction in the uncertainty may take some considerable time.8.     A major uncertainty is whether Concorde can meet existingflyover noise monitoring limits at Kennedy and Heathrow,  evenif no new airport restrictions are imposed between now andConcorde&apos;s entry into service.      The present expectation is,I understand,  that a fully laden Concorde might, in adverse2
atmospheric conditions, exceed the limits in both cases by about-3 PNdB (perceived noise decibels).     Much will depend not onlyon what more can be done to suppress the noise at source butalso on the operational procedures at take-off which it will bepossible to adopt.     And adopting operational procedures to minimise flyover noise might involve a serious increase inlateral noise disturbance in the immediate vicinity of the airport.9.     Whilst it remains the Minister of Technology&apos;s objectiveto ensure that Concorde&apos;s engine noise should be no greaterthan that of existing subsonic jets,  the lateral noise componentin total noise exposure is,  perhaps even more than flyover noise,a particular source of concern.      Even if the   problem of flyovernoise restrictions is overcome,  lateral noise is likely to remain a source of difficulty for some major airports.10.    There is an additional important point in judging public reaction and therefore the acceptability of Concorde.     Evenif the design objective is met,  the timing of Concorde&apos;s entry into airline service will invite comparison not with existingnoisy jets, but with the quieter subsonic aircraft using newtechnology engines, many o? which, will already be in service.Concorde is expected to be a good deal more than twice as noisyon flyover and lateral measurements as the requirement for futuresubsonic aircraft of the same weight under the noise certifica-tion proposals which we are discussing internationally.11.    These issues are part of the wider uncertainties which affect Concorde&apos;s commercial prospects.     I think it right todraw attention to the position as it now appears and to stress the urgency of getting reliable noise figures,  since Concorde&apos;snoise characteristics may be critical to the acceptability ofthe aircraft at vital airports.Conclusion12.   Although substantive decisions are not required before the recess, I invite the Committee(i)    to agree that a decision to ban commercial supersonicflying over the United Kingdom should be considered inthe autumn with a view to an announcement at the time that any Order is made, or legislation introduced,  togive cover for Concorde&apos;s supersonic test routes;(ii)    to take note of the continuing uncertainty   anddisturbing prospects with regard to Concorde&apos;sairport noise.3
