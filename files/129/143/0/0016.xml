C(69) 91 COPY NO,    0 021st July, 19&amp;9CABINETNATIONAL FILM FINANCE corporation memorandum by the Secretary of State for Economic AffairsThe present legislation providing assistance for film productionin this country expires in October and December, 1970.    The ministerial committee on Industrial Policy (IN) have considered proposals by thePresident of the Board of Trade for its extension.    They have agreedthat the legislation governing both the screen quota (whereby cinemasare required to devote a minimum percentage of screen-time to theshowing of British films) and the levy (under which a proportion ofbox office takings is paid into the British Film Production Fund anddistributed to-makers of British films in proportion to their earnings)should be re-enacted with minor amendments to run until 1900,    INhave not, however, been able to reach agreement on the future of theNational Film Finance Corporation (NFFC).Board of Trade proposals,       The President proposes that the NFFC should be continued until1980 and refinanced by the injection of a further  5 million capital; therate of drav/ing could be governed by current financial circumstancesbut in connection v/ith this yearTs PESC exercise it was estimated that 2 million would be needed in 1970-71,  2 million in 1971-72 and 1 mxllion in 1972-73, though I understand that the President hasnow indicated that  1 million might suffice for 1970-71.    The NFFCsauthority to borrow up to  2 million from private sources v/ould alsobe renewed.    The NFFC would also be relieved of its liability to payinterest on the  5 million advanced to it since 1949 by the Governmentand lost,    (The losses would not themselves be written off;  thecapital could be treated as repayable out of any future profits).Background3,      The NFFC v/as established in 1949 to remedy a serious shortageof finance for film production^    It would claim to have contributedgreatly towards the development of film production here over the last20 years.    During this time it has lost some  5 million, of which 2 million represents the loss on loans of  3 million which theGovernment directed them to make to the British Lion Film Corporation,^DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY of HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
Over this period there has been a major change in the situation of film production in this country; but one significant factor has been the growth in the United States proportion of total investment in British film production, which has risen from about 5 0 per cent in 1964 to about90 per cent now.    The contribution made to the industry by the NFFC has there fore been reviewed.(a) In 1965 an inter-departmental group of officials concluded thatthe NFFCs loan^making powers should not be renewed on theirexpiry in March, 1967 as Government financial assistance wasno longer needed to maintain a desirable level of British film production; Board of Trade Ministers proposed, however, totake no decision until film legislation could be reviewed in thelight of the report of the Monopolies Commission on the supplyof films to cinemas, which was then awaited, and TreasuryMinisters accepted this.(b) A further review by the Boasrd of Trade in 196  concluded that inthe presence of the high level of United States investment inBritish film production, the levy and the quota, the NFFCcould not be said to have made a significant contribution inrecent years to employment and prosperity in the industry.Moreover, evea if the NFFC were refinanced on the scale proposed it could not act as a major souxce of film finance,for instance in the event of a withdrawal of United States finance,though it might then be valuable in mobilising other finance; its operations need not be inherently uneconomic, depending on the choice of films; and that, while its overseas earnings did notjufltify       losses Incurred, it made a contribution to import saving which was high relative to the cost of operations.(c) In yet another study, consultants engaged by the industrial reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) found that it was difficultto argue that the NFFC was commercially essential.    However,if the NFFC pursued a more active and commercial policy iimight break even over the years, and if United States financewere withdrawn it would be needed to ensure a healthy Britishfilm industry, though the resources proposed would then haveto be increased considerably.    They consider that if the NFFCwere allowed to disappear now it would be virtually impossibleto recreate it in time to deal with a change in the presentposition.Further report by officials4.     After an inconclusive first discussion and to provide a more substantial basis for decisions, the IN Committee commissioned a further report from officials (annexed), setting out on an agreed basis theoriginal role of the NFFC and the way it has changed and might changefurther; the financial and balance of payments implications of windingit up now; and the likelihood and implications of a withdrawal of UnitedStates funds from the British film industry,-2-
Arguments for the continuation and refinancing of the NFFC5.     A majority of members of IN consider that the NFFC should becontinued and refinanced on the scale proposed for the following reasons -(a) It plays a part even now in attracting United States and privateBritish finance into film production here.    And the industry as a whole is making a substantial contribution not only to employment here and national prestige, but also to the balanceof payments - with a net contribution of  24 million in 1967,in which the major element was direct inward investment.(b) It might be possible for the NFFC to break even in future, ifthe more active policy advocated by the 1958-59&apos;s consultantswere followed, though its role and methods of operation might need some reconsideration and its personnel some strengtheningto make this possible.    The scale of Government assistance inthe past, represented by losses of  3 million spread over20 years (the loss of  2 million on the loan to British Lioncould reasonably be excluded from the calculation) had beenmodest.    Even if the Corporation operated no more profitablythan in the past, the scale of assistance now proposed wouldenable the Corporation to continue in operation for many years;and results in recent years encouraged the hope that theCorporation might be able to break even.(c) To wind up the NFFC would be a serious blow to the morale ofboth sides of the industry, and would be particularly unfortunate when the National Film School was about to beinaugurated.(d) And above all, a refinanced NFFC would provide a mechanismand a nucleus of expertise which would be invaluable inmobilising resources for film production if United Statesfinance were withdrawn.    It was argued that it would not bepossible to reconstitute such a nucleus quickly when neededif the NFFC were wound up now.Arguments for winding up the NFFC6.     On the other hand some Ministers felt that the case for continuing and refinancing the NFFC had not been made out.(a)    There was no real justification for retaining the NFFC in itspresent role.    Film finance was now available from other sources, encouraged by the quota and levy provisions whichit had been agreed should be maintained.    There was doevidence that the NFFCTs contribution to the health of theindustry or to the balance of payments was   such as to justifythe public expenditure involved.
(b) In view of the incentive to film production in Britain provided bythe levy and quota there was no reason to anticipate the withdrawalof United States finance,    H, however, that did happen it couldonly become effective over a period, and it would be better if theaction to be taken were considered at the time in the light of theactual circumstances.    The NFFC would have neither the fundsnor the capacity to serve as the major source of finance for theindustry, so some special action would be required, and it mightbe better to proceed in other ways, for instance under theIndustrial Expansion Act,(c) It was particularly difficult to assess the value of the NFFC as a partial insurance against withdrawal of United States funds as thecost of the &quot;premium&quot; for this insurance was not known, only theamount of capital required and the possible phasing of its expenditure as in paragraph 2 above. While the 1958-59 consultantsmay be right in thinking that a refinanced NFFC should be able tobreak even in (he future, there is no adequate evidence of this orof their commercial policy.Conclusions7.      This last point, the real cost of continuing the NFFC, is one of thetwo crucial factors.    Since the last discussion in the IN Committeeofficials have estimated, on the basis of figures submitted by the NFFC,that the Corporation^ actual and prospective earnings from their investment in the 62 films they assisted in the financial years 1963-68inclusive will be about 5 per cent on a Discounted Cash Flow basis.(This compares with a test discount rate for expenditure in the nationalised industries and other parts of the public sector which now stands at8 per cent but which  understand Ministers may shortly be invited toagree should be raised to 10 per cent).    Moreover, if the Corporation^operating expenses during this period are offset against these earningsthere would be a loss.    In the first three years of this period theestimates show sizeable losses, but for films assisted in the last two years,prospective earnings are substantial.    Speculation about the future,especially the long-term future, of the Corporation can, however only bebased on assumptions which are unprovable.8.      The other main question is whether there is a role for the NFFCto play currently? as well as an Insurance against withdrawal of UnitedStates finance, and if so the precise nature of that role and how it can best be adapted to play it.    There was fairly general agreement in INthat that role would not be the same as that for which it was established20 years ago, and that the NFFCs personnel and operations must be changedin some respects,    K it is agreed in principle that it should be reconstitutedthe President of the Board of Trade might, in the first instance, be invitedto consider further the precise role which it should play in future and the changes needed to make this possible, and to report to IN so that they canconsider the matter further before the legislation is prepared,-4-
9.      I therefore invite my colleagues to decide -(a) whether the NFFC should in principle be reconstituted andrefinanced on the lines proposed by the President of theBoard of Trade; and(b) if so whether further consideration should be given to the precise role it should play, on the lines indicated inparagraph 8 above.P.S.Department of Economic Affairs, S. W.l.18th July, 1969-5-
THE FUTURE OP THE NATIONAL FILM FINANCE CORPORATIONReport by OfficialsWhen considering the future of the National Film Financejorporation,  the Ministerial CJommittee on Industrial Policy requested[115(69)6th Meeting) further information on certain issues.    This note,ihich provides it, has been agreed &quot;by the Official Committee on industrial Policy.fhe circumstances of the U.K. film industry (19U9-69)I   In the immediate post-war years, the film industry was the majorledium of popular entertainment;    since then, television has largelysuperseded the cinema in this field.   Cinema going habits have changedsarkedly and the size of the cinema audience has declined by five-sixths.   Film production in Britain is now heavily dependent on U.S.funds.   The circumstances of the industry when the N.F.F.C. was originally established no longer obtain.   Ministers have alreadylecided that legislation is to be introduced to continue the Screenfaota and the levy.   The main economic issues relevant to a considera-tion of the future of the N.F.F.G. are the film industry&apos;s contributionto the balance of payments and the present and potential future rolet U.S. funds.Changes in the role of the N.F.F.C. (1914.9-69)J,   The initial task of the N.F.F.C. was to make available fundsurgently to&apos;maintain a British film production capability.   TheCorporation, on Government instructions, lent  3 million to Britishlion.   Although this action enabled film production to keep going andemployment to be maintained, British Lion subsequently failed:    of theCorporation1 s total losses of about  5 million, approximatelyK million, was- due &quot;to this venture, &apos;&quot;&quot; &quot;&apos;\,   The N.F.F.C. was initially required to confine its activities toproductions which could not obtain finance from other sources.Mending legislation passed in 1957 enabled it to finance anyproduction with reasonable expectations of being commerciallysuccessful.   Of the 730 Quota films exhibited as first featurestaring 1950-61 , 366 - just over half - were assisted by loans from thetorporation..5&apos;   It is arguable that the N.F.F.C. made a substantial contribution.to keeping British film studios going during the most difficult post-Jar years;&apos; however, they are no longer playing a comparable role,jtoce 1961, only 20 per cent of British Quota films exhibited as firstfeatures have been assisted financially by the N.F.F.C.    In 1968,his had fallen to h per cent, because of lack of funds available for;,&apos;p.P.C. lending.   The N.F.F.C. estimate that in 1965 and 1966, U.S.sources provided about 75 per cent of the money used to financefittfih registered first and co-feature films;    in 1967 and 1968,had risen to 90 per cent.   It is clear that ample total funds&apos;Pe now available for film production in this country, although these^predominantly of U.S. origin.
6,    Investment in the film industry is highly speculative andunattractive to most lending organisations hut attracts a specialisedkind of entrepreneur.    The N.F.F.C.  claim that its participation hasbeen an incentive to prospective investors in the past, but it isimpossible to quantify the value of British investment encouraged bythe N.F.F.C. which would not otherwise have taken place.The future role of the 3ST.F.F.C.7,    The N.F.F.C. is required to pay its way:    it may lend only to persons who, in the Corporations judgment, have a reasonableexpectation of being able to produce or distribute films on acommercially successful basis.   The Board of Trade does not intendthat there, shall be any weakening of this requirement.8.    The I.R.C. agreed to advise the President of the Board of trade on the capital structure of the N.F.F.C:. and on the commercial andfinancial aspects of its operations.   They appointed Messrs. Burneyand Berriman to carry out the study.   Their report suggested thatthe N.F.F.C. should provide(a) pre-production expenditure;(b) finance for film production;    and(c) completion guarantees.They argued that the Corporation, while continuing to be a source of funds for the film industry, should also play a more active role as apartner for established producers and become more closely connected,with distributors and producers/distributors in order to(i)    provide a complete service to producers,  similar to thatsupplied currently by U.S. distributors;(ii)   tap the financial resources of distributors throughout theworld to supply a major proportion of production expenditure for U.K. films;    and(iii)    avoid the need to sell U.S. distribution rights in advance and hence enable U.K. producers to share directly in theprofits earned in the most important overseas market.The reasoning underlying these recommendations was that closer association with film distribution should enable the Corporation toobtain more attractive terms for its financial assistance to film production, the I.R.C. report having said that, provided their recommendations were progressively implemented, the Corporation mayexpected to break even over the years.    The Chief Secretary smemorandum (IN( 69) 16) drew attention to the lack of supporting evidencefor this view.5.   If it were decided to keep the N.F.F.C. in existence,  thesetotalled proposals would require further consideration by theBoard of Trade, in consultation with the Treasury.   They envisageafully commercial &quot;private enterprise&quot; role in effect for theCorporation and an attempt to preserve a British financed film2
production capability.    They envisage no change in the Corporation&apos;sestablished function of encouraging and assisting the production offilms for the commercial cinema.    The exhibition of these films abroadno doubt has some prestige value, but this is not the N.F.F.O&apos;sorimary aim.   Nor is it the Corporations function to encourage the film as an art form.The-implicationsi of winding uxj the N.F.F.C. in present circumstances(a)   Fijxancial10.   In accounting terms,  the N.F.F.C. made annual losses in fourteenand profits in six financial years.   The average annual loss peraccounts during the last three financial years was about  198.000.However, if the interest liabilities in respect of past irretrievablecapital losses are excluded, the average annual loss was only  88,000and the Corporation broke even in 1968/9 and may be expected to earn   -a profit in 1969/70.   Given the highly speculative nature of the film industry and the length of the production/distribution cycle, it isnot possible to predict the Corporation&apos;s profitability in accountingterms in the longer term,11.   The prospect of the N.F.F.C. earning profits in future will ultimately depend on its ability to(a) channel funds into films which earn profits overall;    and(b) obtain more advantageous terms to secure a reasonable shareof these profits - the I.R.C. Report suggested some revised arrangements.The Corporation expect that the 62 first feature films which itagreed to finance in the period 1st April 1963-31 st March 1968 willyield total receipts of  3.6 million against total advances of 3.2 million.   Some of this  -3.6 million has already been receivedby the Corporation;    the remainder reflects their best estimates ofthe receipts likely to accrue in future years.   Because of the extended production/distribution cycle for films it is necessary todiscount the time streams of future receipts to calculate theS.F.P.C&apos;s gross rate of return on capital.    It has not been possibleto complete this assessment on the information provided by the N.F.F.C-to date, but it is hoped that fuller information will be available at the meeting.3
12.   If the NoF.P.0. were wound up, there would obviously be nofurther loss to public funds;    nor would there by any possibility that they might earn sufficient in future, perhaps by operating onthe lines indicated .above, to recover any earlier losses.(t)   Balance of payments13, In considering the balance of payments aspects of the N.F.F.C&apos;operations, it is necessary to(a) examine the total balance of payments account of the film industry;    and(b) attempt some assessment of the Corporations specificcontribution to it, in relation to the sums involved andthe return on them.Ill,  The cinematograph film industry&apos;s net contribution to thebalance of payments has increased from about  5 million in 1963 toabout  2k million in 1967.    The following table, which showsseparately the transations of the U.K. subsidiaries of major U.S.film companies, gives a more detailed breakdown for 19&amp;&quot;7 Q? *heconst itu ent items.k

15,   These statistics, which are derived from the Board of Trade&apos;sdinemategraph Industry Inquiry, do not cover all the film companies&apos;transactions affecting the balance of payments.   They omit profits orcapital transactions (other than the provision of production finance) .nevertheless, the important points which emerge are:-(a) the largest item is payments received by U.S. firms in britain from overseas residents, of which a mao:or componentis the provision of finance for film production in Britain.Even if U.S. funds for film production were entirely replaced by U.K. finance, the industry&apos;s contribution to the balanceof payments would be reduced since this would be replacinginward investment by domestic investment.   The balance ofpayments would still benefit from the foreign exchangereceipts from the distribution and exhibition overseas of u.K. financed films, but these would probably be lower thanat present since films financed from U.S. sources are likely&quot;to secure better distribution arrangements in the U.S.A,(b) U.S. firms in Britain caused a net balance of payments drainin respect of payments associated with performance rights,though this was more than offset by the net earnings onfilm production;(c) the net balance of payments contribution of U.S. firms in britain was lower in 19^7 than that of other firms.16,  In 1968 the Board of Trade made a study of the N,F.F.C&apos;contribution to the balance of payments in the years 19&amp;5 and 1966.?he study examined the validity of the claim that the Corporationscontribution to overseas earnings was an important justification forits continued operations and the extent of its contribution to import saving.   The study, which was perforce based on rather artificialassumptions, concluded that(a) the N.F.F.C. was not earning a sufficiently higher value offoreign currency than other film financing organisations -British or American - to justify the cost to public funds,and(b) the N.F.F.C&apos;s contribution to import saving was highrelative to the cost of its operations and -probably greaterthan the cost of diverting scarce resources into film production, from other uses.^likelihood of a withdrawal of U.S. funds17.  The British film industry has expressed concern for some yearsaoout the possibility of an early withdrawal of U.S. funds, whichl()uld he diverted to Hollywood.   Signs are already said to beparent, because of(i)   union pressure in the U.S.A. to limit production in countries overseas;6
(ii) the reduction in the differential between British and american costs of film production;(iii) the possibility that the Americans may institute an equivalent to the British film&apos;fund (the levy);(iv)    the alleged lack of success of recent films financed by american companies and produced in the U.K.-18, On the other hand there are factors which might be expected to-ork against an early withdrawal of U.S. funds.    The levy, whichiinisters have agreed to continue, was judged by the 1965 inter-iepartmental working party to provide &quot;a powerful stimulus to filminduction in the U..K.,  including production by U.S. interests,  andiill do so as long as it continues&quot;.   Film production in other Western -iiropean countries which also support their indigenous industries,slso depends, in part, on U.S. funds.    It seems reasonable to assume that any retrenchment would affect these industries at least as hard-sthe British.   The advanced technological resources of Britishstudios, the high calibre and popularity of British stars, directorsid other staff, the common language and cultural affinities mightill be expected to cushion the blow to the British industry in presentlircumstances.   It is impossible to be sure about longer term prospects,lie implications of a withdrawal of U.S. funds&apos;5. Given the predominance of U.S. funds in the U.K. film productionindustry, where total investment is currently about  30 million peranum, any substantial withdrawal would create a serious situation iniie industry, unless alternative sources of funds could be readilySapped.-0. The most serious effect on the balance of payments would be thetoss of inward investment,  referred to in paragraph 15 above.    Thesubstitution of equal sums of U.K.. capital would riot offset this loss,fee would be additional unfavourable balance of payments effects if^withdrawal of U.S. funds caused an overall reduction in film production in this country,  since this might leas to increased Imports&apos;foreign films and lower overseas earnings from films made in theI.K.The Board of Trade consider that an N.F.F.C. refinanced as proposed*d not hope to fill the gap left by a withdrawal of U.S. funds,totit would at least provide the nucleus around, which film production:ould continue.   To some limited extent, privace British investmentjwld no doubt keep part of the industry going.   Following theirjake-over of ABPC,  E.M.I. have announced plans for increased production.* help would be needed from all quarters, and the N.F.F.C. would iniileir view have an important role to play.;2&apos; The Treasury and theD.E,A, do not consider that the role of the:J,Jf.C., on immediate future circumstances of this kind, would be soSl?nifleant as to justify its retention &quot;as an insurance&quot;.    The N.F.F.C-.^ld not in any case supply more than a small part of the funds*^ed to offset a big withdrawal of U.S. finance.7
Igyernment action to ameliorate; the effects of a withdrawal of U.S.funds23,   In the Board of Trade&apos;s view, the continued existence of theI.P.F.C. is desirable, particularly as it should he possible for itto continue without&apos; loss, as a measure of insurance against possibleB,S, withdrawals.   The N.F.F.C. has established, over twenty years,much information and experience about the workings of the industry,  anda competent staff.   This would be lost if the present legislationlapsed.   The reconstitution of the N.F.F .0&apos;. from scratch and the recruitment of suitable staff, would take time when urgent actionnight be needed to counter the effects of a U.S. withdrawal.   Thereare clear indications that if the N.F.F.C. were wound up, theGovernment would come under immediate pressure to support alternative means of providing British capital for film production - e.g. by government guarantee of private investment.Ik.   The Treasury consider that a withdrawal of U-S. funds from theBritish film industry on a scale likely to cause serious difficulty to the balance of payments would not occur so suddenly as to rule outthe possibility of considering appropriate Government action at that stage, in the light of circumstances ruling at the time.    Theresuscitation of an N.F .F.C .-type organisation would be one possibility.But alternative ways of mobilising capital for the industry would.need to be considered, including the possibility of backing individualproduction units rather than particular films.    This might involve some measure of assistance under the Industrial Expansion Act.Jepartment of Economic Affairs,London, s.W.1 .%;July, 1969
