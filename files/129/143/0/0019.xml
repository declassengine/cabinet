C(69JL9421st July, 1969RACIAL DISCRIMINATION AND GOVERNMENT CONTRACTSMemorandum by the Attorney-general it is proposed that there should be included in government contracts a clause to the following effect:-&quot;(1)   The contractor shall not unlawfully discriminatewithin the meaning and scope of the provisionsof the Race Relations Act, 196.8 or any statutorymodification or re-enactment thereof relating todiscrimination in employment.(2)   The contractor shall take all reasonable steps tosecure the observance of the provisions of sub-clause (1) hereof by all servants, employeesor agents of the contractor and all sub-contractorsemployed in the execution of the contract. &quot;2,     Assuming that such a clause is thought to be necessary (though I myself think it is unnecessary and sets an undesirable precedent), a difference of opinion has arisen as to how breach of the clause on thepart of a contractor should be handled and what consequences are tofollow from breach of it.3.     If the clause is to have legal or practical significance, it isimportant to consider the consequences that are to flow from breach ofthe clause.    What has been suggested is that further government contracts might be withheld from a contractor in breach of the clause and that this should be announced when the new clause is announced.4.     It is open to a Government department to refuse to do business with a particular contractor just as a private individual may refuse.But the Crown is in an exceptionally powerful and often a monopolyposition and the sanction of withholding further contracts could havegravely damaging effects both upon the firms themselves and their employees.    Indeed it could drive a firm out of business.    Where theground is already covered by legislation providing sanctions for unlawfulconduct, for the Executive to withhold further contracts i&amp; to impose a penalty in addition to that prescribed by the law - in this case the race relations Act.    This provides $ax appropriate circumstances for the grantCOPY NO.  6 6CABINET-1-CONFIDENTIAL
of an injunction, with the risk of imprisonment for contempt, if it is notcomplied with.    In my view we ought not to embark upon the impositionof extra statutory sanctions for unlawful conduct without giving careful thought to the implications of what we are doing.    Suppose for instancethe Industrial Relations Bill had become law.    The present proposal would form a precedent for a future administration announcing that nofurther Government contracts would be awarded to a firm whoseemployees had been found to be in breach of a conciliation pause Order,or indeed whose employees were thought by the Executive to be in breach,5.     As I see it, the implication of the imposition of an extrastatutory sanction, now that time has elapsed since the passing of the race Relations Act, is that the Act is defective because inadequate,and that accordingly it is the Government^ intention to single out forspecial treatment those employers and employees who carry outGovernment contracts.    The Fair Wages clause which is inserted inGovernment contracts has been cited as a precedent  or what is nowproposed.    In my view the position there is quite different.    that clause imposes no obligation upon the contractor to comply with the law,but provides simply that he shall pay wages and observe hours andconditions of labour not less favourable than the. going rate for thedistrict.6.     If the sanction is to be imposed, the question arises whether thedecision to withhold further contracts should be taken before there hasbeen a Court finding that the contractor has beer, guilty of discrimination.Cases could arise where further contracts were withheld because a complaint had been made and later the Board considered that there wasno case for Court proceedings or when the case came to Court thecourt found the complaint unjustified,     I understand it is now theintention that the withholding of contracts a hall not be in the discretion of contract officers and other officials but that every case shall bereferred to Ministers.    E what is proposed is to be done, this isclearly a desirable provision.   However in my view it would be wrong for Ministers to reach a decision to withhold further contracts unless there had been a finding of discrimination by the Court.    The Courtmight find there had been no discrimination and meantime the withdrawalof contracts could have had most damaging consequences.    It is significant that the Fair Wages clause provides that if any question arisesas to whether the requirements of the clause are being observed thequestion if not otherwise disposed of shall be referred by the Minister ofLabour to an independent Tribunal.    The equivalent Tribunal in thepresent context is the Court itself.7,     It has been suggested that the sanction should extend not only tothe withholding of future contracts but to the cancellation of existingones.    Clearly there would be no justification for cancelling a contract which did not contain the new clause.    But a further question arises as respects contracts containing the clause which had already begun to be implemented.    The original decision of the Home Affairs Committee wasthat no provision should be made for the fosfefctofe of contracts already-2-
in force.    If it is now decided that they should be liable to cancellation,careful thought will have to be given to the terms of the clause.    unless it is appropriately drafted a department which cancelled an existingcontract 6n the ground of discrimination might itself be liable in damagesfor breach of contract,8.    A further matter for consideration is what conditions acontractor must satisfy before he is restored to acceptability and can be offered further contracts.    Section 13 of the Race Relations Act, 1968provides that anything done by a person in the course of his employmentshall be treated for the purposes of the Act as done by his employer aswell as by him, whether or not it was done with his employeesknowledge or approval.     This means that discrimination at a sing&amp;ebuilding site, for instance, could involve a large contractor in liability to Court proceedings and if he were struck off the list of Governmentcontractors there could be a continuing loss both to the firm and itsworkpeople and also to the Treasury if the firm was the lowesttenderer,9.     I think there is danger in taking the view that the policy can beleft to develop with time and that Ministers can do what seems mostexpedient as cases arise.    An objectionable feature of the proposedprocedure is that it is envisaged that sanctions may be applied in acapricious fashion.    Where for instance contractors are monopolysuppliers or for some other reason the only source of essentialGovernment supplies, I understand ffc is proposed that they shouldcontinue to be offered contracts,    It is fundamental that the Governmentshould not act inconsistently or arbitrarily.    Cancellation ofGovernment contracts or refusal to do further business can have most damaging consequences for both employers and workpeople and unlessthe policy is implemented in a way seen to be just, there is serious risk of criticism, noi least from the Parliamentary Commissioner,10,     My conclusion is that if the clause is to be introduced intoGovernment contracts it should be on the understanding that failure tocomply with it should be dealt with by the ordinary processes of the law(i,e. under the Race Relations Act procedures).     At any rate thereshould in my view be no commitment new to the imposition of sanctions.So far as I know, neither the Race Relations Board nor the Rose report has advocated the use of sanctions.    The Rose Report recommends thatif such a clause is added to Government or local authority contractsresponsibility for ensuring compliance should be given to the race relations Board, to which complaints could be referred and whichcould make its own investigations.    In my view this is all that is neededK the Government were asked what would be the consequences of failure to comply with the clause the reply would be that the complaint would bereferred to the Board.11,    Although the important issue in my view ie whether sanctionsother than those provided for in the Race Relations Act should be imposed on a contractor guilty of discrimination, I think it is open to question whether a clause should be introduced into Government contractsor whether the matter can be dealt with in some other way.    Provisions
are not inserted in formal legal documents like Government contractsunless they have reference to the subject matter of the contract andare intended to have legal effect.    Both the Confederation of BritishIndustry and the Trades Union Congress are opposed to the proposal toput the clause in the contracts.    It has been suggested that it would besufficient that when a Government contract is entered into the contractor should be reminded of the provisions of the Race relations act relating to employment and be told that he is expected to comply with it.    This I think is a preferable way of dealing with the matter, andthe letter accompanying the contract could go on to say that any complaint of failure to comply would result in a reference to the Race relations board,F.E.
