DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(69) 81 COPY NO. ^14th July, 1969CABINETIMPLEMENTATION OF THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEEON LOCAL AUTHORITY PERSONAL. AND ALLIED services memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services the central i-e commendation of the Committee on LocalAuthority Personal and Allied Services (the Seebohm Committee)was that a unified social work service should be provided at locallevel as follov/s -(a) The local authority children1 s and welfare services shouldbe amalgamated and should absorb social work functionsof local authorities as health authorities and certain social work functions in the fields of education and housing.(b) There should be a statutory committee responsible for these services and with no other major responsibilities.(c) There should, be a statutory officer responsible to this committeefor these services and not subordinate to any other principalofficer.(d) Appointments to the principal officer post should initially besubject to I/Iinisterial approval,(e) These organisational changes should be made obligatory on allthe responsible authorities (i. e. county councils, county boroughs and London boroughs) as soon as possible, without waiting for local government reorganisation.ViTe have made it clear that we should not announce any decisions uponthe Report until we have consulted local authority and other interests concerned (CC(68) 36th Conclusions, Minute 3) and that we should haveto examine the-Seebohm Report and the administrative reorganisation of the health services together in the light of the recommendations ofthe Royal Commission on Local Government in England (theRede liffe-Maud Commission).
2.       The Ministerial Committee on Social Services have now considered all these in close association with the Ministerial Committeeon Local Government Reorganisation.    Their view is that we should -(i) Announce how our agreement with the Seebohm Committee&apos;scentral recommendation in respect of the children&apos;s and welfare services and the personal social services now in the healthfield (leaving social work in education and housing for later consideration).(ii) Discuss with local authority and other interests how best to giveeffect to this against the background of the Redcliffc-MaudReport.(iii) Announce in the autumn our decisions on this and the relatedissue of the future local authority role in the health field, and later in the year publish a revised Green Paper on theAdministrative Structure of the Health Services.The purpose of this memorandum is to seek the Cabinet&apos;a agreement to an announcement, in the terms of the draft attached, of our acceptanceof the main Seebohm recommendation and of our intention to discuss v/iththose concerned how best to make a start with implementing it.Method of implementation3.       On the method of implementation the Social Services Committeesaw three alternatives -(i)  To dp nothing! until decisions have been taken on the redcliffe-Maud Roport.(&quot;)  To implement across the board the essential Seebohmrecommendation (paragraphs l(a)-(d) above) i. c, a unified localauthority social work department;  a statutory local authority committee;and a statutory principal officer.(iii)  To implement the essential package selectively.    This meansapplying it where there is no good reason to wait for the completion oflocal government reorganisation.    It is common ground that it shouldbe applied to the London boroughs, which have already been reorganised,at an early date after legislation is obtained, and to Wales and monmouthshire at a date which appearr to the Secretary of Statefor Wales to be appropriate, having regard to the progress of localgovernment reorganisation in Wales, assuming legislation in the 1969-70Session.
To do nothing until after local government has been reorganised4.       The Ministers responsible for the principal local authority-personal services (the Home Secretary and I), put strongly to theSocial Services Committee our reasons for thinking that we couldnot afford to wait until the new reorganised local authorities were about to take over - perhaps in April, 1974 - before taking actionon the central recommendations of the Seebohm. Report.    Our reasonswere -(a) That the formation of a single local authority social work service is long overdue.(b) That delay is detrimental to the morale of the services and to the welfare of their clients, inhibiting necessary improvements inthe service,(c) That some local authorities were reorganising their committees or departments to bring the personal &quot;social services under theMedical Officer of Health, which conflicts both with the centralcore of the Seebohm Report and without our proposals forreorganising the health services.The Social Services Committee accepted the view that, faced withthis situation, we could not delay the implementation of the SeebohmReport until local government reorganisation was complete.    We must therefore consider how best to proceed pending local government eor ganisation.The comprehensive solution5.      A clear majority of the Social Services Committee consideredthat the minimum requirements set out in paragraph 2(i) above shouldbe made mandatory on all existing local authorities in England at anearly common date.    The principal argument in favour of this is thatthe integration of the local social services and the reorganisation oflocal government itself are operations of different kinds and wouldhave their principal impact at different levels.    The integration ofthe social services would mainly affect the social workers on theground.    The reorganisation of local government, however, would affect primarily the number of principal officer posts in the country as a whole, and the extent of the area, and hence the number of localsub-divisions, each with its social work team, for which each principalofficer was responsible.    But there is no reason why it should producemajor repercussions on the social work teams on the ground.    It might even be an advantage to have the reorganisation of the social workservices well in train before the reorganisation of local governmenthad to be undertaken,
6,       In addition, the mandatory introduction of the central Seebohmreforms in all existing local authority aroas would place a responsibilityfor child care and the legal obligations flowing from it clearly on theappropriate Committee and principal officer.    It v/ould restrain thosecouncils which wanted to be free from statutory.requirements in respectof children from setting up an unsatisfactory form of organisation.    Andit would give the social work services the confidence necessary for theproper development of the services.    Any other course would be bitterlyopposed by the professional social work organisations,7,       Finally,   there is no guarantiee that the reorganisation of localgovernment would not take longer than is now planned.    It is therefore the more important to ensure that the Seebohra reforms do not wait onthe reform of local government.    Delay or selective application would merely result in the best staff being drained from authorities that wait for the Rede liffo-Maud reorganisation, and the standard of the less ableauthorities would thus be depressed still further.The selective implementation of the Seebohm recommendations.      Selective implementation was preferred by a minority 6i trieCommittee which included the Minister without Portfolio and theMinister for Planning and Land.    They argued that we should be liable to criticism if we introduced legislation to require all the124 county councils and county boroughs in England outside greater london to reorganise their social services at a time when it willalready be known that a substantial proportion of them will have only two or three years of separate existence left, and when all local authorities will be preoccupied with wider problems of localgovernment reorganisation.     This reorganisation would have repercussions at both headquarters and operational levels ineach authority;  a double set of changes within a short spaceof time would be damaging to the services themselves.    Moreover,the argument for carrying out the Seebohm reforms before the reform of local government itself is in embarrassing conflict with the argument for setting aside the recommendations of the Boundary Commission inorder to avoid two changes in constituency boundaries within a few years.9,       On the other hand, a selective approach v/ould permit there organisation of local authority social service arrangements to be linked with the progress of local government reorganisation.    The33 London authorities (which are not threatened -with local governmentchanges) would be required to adopt the new set-up straightaway.    If,in addition, the Seebohm arrangements were applied to existing authorities which appeared likely to be the basis of a future mainauthority, it is estimated that the total in England on this basis might amount to nearly one-third of the existing authorities concerned, or,numerically, more than one half of the future R.edcliffe-Maudauthorities.
10,       The selective approach would also make it possible to simplify the legislation by leaving undisturbed, pending general reorganisation,the present statutory arrangements which now allow about 30 largerdistrict councils in some 20 counties to exercise delegated functions in the fields of health and welfare,11,       The alternative comprehensive solution v/ould mean alteringmany authorities1 arrangements again soon after they had been made and would involve the displacement of many newly appointed officers.Finally, with regard to the critical problem of morale, this could be restored and local authorities deterred from adopting different patterns of organisation by a clear Government statement in favour of the Seebohmpattern and a selective approach by legislation which would make a starton the implementation of Seebohm and would indicate the governments intention that it should, on reorganisation, become general.Conclusion12,      It is not necessary - and indeed would be wrong - for the Cabinetto reach a decision now on whether to implement the central Seebohmrecommendations across the board or selectively.    The Social services committee will make firm recommendations on this in November in thelight of further discussions with the local authorities, with a view to theintroduction of a Bill at the end of January,    The points on which adecision is required are -(i)  The acceptance of the Seebohm Committee1 s central recommen-dation that the children&apos;s and welfare services together with certainpersonal services now the responsibility of the local authority health departments should be brought together in a single local authority social service department,(ii)  The proposal to make a start with implementing the SeebohmReport ahead of the main local government reorganisation by introducingearly legislation.13.      In addition, the attached statement, which I propose to makebefore the Recess, will make it clear that the integrated administrative structure of the health services, the need for which will be restated ina revised Green Paper about the end of the year, will include the personal health services now provided by the local authorities.It is important to say this now, without prejudice to other decisions on the administrative structure of the health services, in order togive an indication of the future functions of the local authority social service departments and of the bodies responsible for the unified health authorities.
14.      Accordingly I ask the Cabinet to authorise me to make astatement in the House of Commons in the terms of the draft anneito this memorandum.    The draft has been approved by the social services Committee,r.i-i.s.c.Department of Health and Social Security, S, E.1,14th July, 1969
annex draft JULY statement the Government has always made it clear that it would be necessary  to examine further the report of the Seehohm Committeeon Local Authority and Allied Personal Social Services and theform of the administrative reorganisation of the health servicestogether in the light of the recommendations of the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England.     The Royal CommissionsReport was not available until early June, and those concernedrequire time to assimilate it before giving their further views.We shall therefore aim to announce decisions on the SeebohmCommittee&apos;s recommendations and on certain matters affectingthe health services in the autumn and to issue later in the yeara revised Green Paper on the administrative structure of the health services for public discussion.But I can say now that the Government is in agreement withthe Seebohm Committee that the main social work services, i.e. thechildren&apos;s and welfare services, together with certain personal social services now the responsibility of local authority health departments, should be brought together in a single localauthority department.     We are ready to make a Start withimplementing the Seebohm Report and we accordingly propose to conclude consultations at the end of October with a view to theintroduction of early legislation.Given this timetable, the Government wish to reiterate that local authorities would be most unwise to embark on schemes of reorganisation which might in the event be found incompatible with the Governments decisions.I can also confirm that the Government&apos;s revised proposalsfor the health services will restate the need, which hascommanded widespread support, for bringing together into an integrated administrative structure the hospital service, the family practitioner services under Executive Councils and the personal health services provided by local authorities.     TheGovernment further recognises the need for the new integratedstructure to reflect the demand for participation by thecommunity.     The announcement I shall be making in the autumn will5.
deal with the latter point.     It will also indicate where, inthe Governments view, the dividing line should he drawn betweenthe personal social services integrated in the new localauthority departments and the newly integrated health servicesand the relationship of the latter to a reformed system oflocal government.6.
