THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC^MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1945.RETURN OF VOLUNTEERS FROM THE POLISPI ARMED forces to POLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.IT has become essential, in my view, to make shipping available to transport as soon as possible to Poland about 23,000 members of the Polish Armed Forcesin this country, who have expressed the wish to return to Poland.2. It is now some time since it was made known to the Polish Armed forces under our Command that any who wished to return to Poland could so signify.Out of about 60,000 in this country 23,000 have volunteered, and these have beenput in a special transit camp. The Polish Government, as my colleagues are nodoubt aware, have been making propaganda to the effect that we and anti-WarsawPolish officers under our Command have been maliciously putting difficulties inthe way of the transfer to Poland of the Armed Forces under our Command. ThePolish Government have proved extremely difficult to deal with in this matter.It was a long time before they would agree to send here a Military Mission todiscuss with us the question of the Polish Armed Forces. Some four weeks agothey at last did so, but evidence has gradually accumulated that, while continuing the propaganda line referred to above, the Communist influences in the PolishGovernment are not in reality anxious to see large numbers of the Polish armed forces under our Command returning immediately as formed bodies of troops.In the negotiation with the Polish Military Mission they have revived a claim that all the Polish forces under our Command should be transferred to the command of officers appointed from Warsaw, although I informed the PolishGovernment, in entire agreement with the Secretary of State for War several months ago, that this demand was entirely unacceptable, since we are informed by our military authorities that a complete breakdown of discipline would ensue.Moreover, we are pledged publicly not to bring pressure to bear on any Polesfrom the Armed Forces under our Command to return to Poland if they do not want to do so. The Polish Military Mission sent here, while agreeing thatno one should be compelled to return to Poland, has declined hitherto to discussarrangements for the return of all those who do wish to go and have only wishedto select a certain limited number of hand-picked technicians. It looks as thoughthe Communists, who have the last word in the Polish Government, wish to takeback only a certain number of Poles from the Forces under our Command of whosesupport they feel certain or at any rate to have the men back in small driblets.3. On the other hand, Marshal Rola-Zymierski, the Polish Commander-in-Chief in Warsaw, has repeatedly informed our Ambassador that he is motstanxious to get the bulk of the Polish Armed Forces under our Command backas formed bodies of troops as quickly as possible; and M. Mikolajczyk repeated to me when I saw him here on the 15th November, as he has consistently told us before, that it is highly important to secure the earliest possible return of thesemen, since their return will strengthen the anti-Communist forces in Poland,will lead, he feels sure, to a large proportion of those who are at present undecidedmaking up their minds to go back, and also because their non-return is being made an excuse by the Communists for postponing the elections in Poland and a subjectof propaganda against this country. M. Mikolajczyk has also told us that once we can announce that transport is ready to take back immediately thoseof the Polish Armed Forces in this country who wish to go, the Communistswill not dare to delay any longer in accepting them.13033   [30905]SECRET. CopyNa    63CP. (45) 290.17th November, 1945.CABINET.
4. i entirely agree with M. Mikolajczyk&apos;s views and consider the immediatereturn of these men of great political importance in the struggle between theCommunist and Democratic forces in Poland and in the interest of maintaining and developing contacts between Poland and the West, which the Communistswish to prevent.5. I need hardly point out that from the domestic point of view it isdesirable to do everything to secure the return of the maximum number of Polesfrom this country where they present a formidable problem constituting as theydo the largest formed body of troops in the country. The return of these men will,I hope, accelerate the flow of further volunteers from this country and from italy and the Middle East, where they present an awkwmrd problem, too. Thereare some 90,000 Polish troops in Italy; they will soon be more numerous thanthe reduced British and American forces, and there are strong political objectionsto keeping them in Italy once that becomes the case.6. It would be unsatisfactory to send back these Polish volunteers fromthe Armed forces in this country over land through the Russian zone in Germany.In the first place, this route is entirely occupied by the return of Polish displaced persons from our zone in Germany as fast as the Russians and Poles have agreedto take them. Even so, it is unlikely that it will be possible to return all thesebefore winter closes down the route. Secondly, as M. Mikolajczyk pointed out to me on the 15th November, it would be extremely bad if the volunteers fromthe Polish Armed Forces under our Command, by going back through Germanyand the Russian zone, got mixed up with the displaced persons. It is important that they should go back so far as possible in formed units and in good heart.7. . I therefore ask my colleague to agree that the troop-shipping required toget these Poles back to Poland at a reasonable rate should at once be madeavailable as an exception to the priorities ruling at present and that the WarOffice in conjunction with the Minister of War Transport should arrange the move with as little interference as possible with other planned movement.E. B.Foreign Office, 17 th November, 1945.
