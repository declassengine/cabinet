The material is of great historicalvalue and also of considerable practical importance in relation to the develop-ment of Soviet policy. It is, of course, impossible to give a complete picture of the policy of the Soviet Government without access to Russian archives i.e.. we can observe from the German archives what form Soviet policy took, butwe cannot be sure of the motives behind it. None the less certain facts emergeabout the nature and methods of this policy.It may therefore be of interest to my colleagues if I give them threeexamples of the execution of Soviet policy in relation to Germany (and,indirectly, to- Great Britain). I therefore take (1) the negotiations leading upto the conclusion of the Soviet-German Non-aggression Pact of August 1939,(2) Ribbentrop&apos;s interview with Stalin immediately after the conclusion of thispact, (3) Molotov&apos;s interviews with Hitler and Ribbentrop on his visit to Berlinin November 1940.(1) Negotiations leading up  to  the  conclusion of  the Soviet-German  Non-Aggression Pact of August 1939.It appears that, as early as the 17th April, 1939, &quot;feelers&quot; were thrown out on the Russian side to explore the possibilities of an improvement in Soviet-German political relations. On the 20th May Molotov told Schulenburg(German Ambassador at Moscow) that the Soviet Government regarded the resumption of Soviet-German trade negotiations (which had drifted into animpasse) as &apos;&apos; inopportune &apos;&apos; until a &apos;&apos; political basis &apos;&apos; had been found for them.Schulenburg thought that Molotov used these words not to close downnegotiations but because he really wanted the Germans to make a politicaloffer.On the 26th May Ribbentrop drafted instructions for Schulenburg for an interview with Molotov. These instructions were characteristically German inthe sense in which the late Sir Eyre Crowe used to sum up German policy asbased on the maxim &quot;Be my friend or I will kill you,&quot; but, while theythreatened Russia if she joined the Anglo-French combination, they also made it clear that Germany was willing to make a bargain with Russia if the SovietGovernment so desired. Hitler seems to have decided that this combination of &apos;&apos; warning plus offer &apos;&apos; should be presented in Berlin. Hence Weizsackerdelivered it to the Russian charge d&apos;affaires.TOP SECRETCP. (45) 262.20th October, 1945.12998   [30776]b
For the next four-five weeks each party waited for the other to make a move.The Russians were distrustful of Germany; the Germans nervous that theSoviet Government merely wanted a German offer in order to be able to putSressure on England and France. On the 28th June Schulenburg found[olotov still encouraging, and obviously impressed to hear that the GermanGovernment regarded the Soviet-German neutrality agreement of 1926 as stillvalid. (This treaty originally a counter-move by Russia to the Locarnotreaties- had been renewed in 1933, but the Soviet Government considered that hitler regarded it as obsolete.)The Soviet-German trade negotiations were resumed on the 21st July. Onthe 27th July (two days after the Russians had been informed that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment had agreed to their demand for the opening of Anglo-Franco-soviet military conversations in Moscow), Schnurre (of the German Foreign Office),who was in charge of the Trade negotiations on the German side, told the Sovietcharge d&apos;affaires in Berlin that the Germans wanted the restoration of goodpolitical relations with the Soviet Government either by a revival of the treatyof 1926 or by some new arrangement. From a telegram sent by Weizsacker toSchulenburg it appears that the charge d&apos;affaires asked whether, in the. eventof a highly placed Soviet personage discussing the matter with a highly placedGerman personage, the German intentions with regard to Russia would be as stated by Schnurre. The charge d&apos;affaires also said that Danzig would returnby one way or another to the Reich, and that the question of the Corridor mustbe settled in favour of Germany.Since the charge d&apos;affaires could not have spoken in this way withoutinstructions, it seems clear that, at the time when the Soviet Government wereinviting an Anglo-French military mission to Moscow, they were also lettingthe Germans know that they would allow the question of Danzig and the Corridorto be settled as Germany desired.Henceforward matters moved quickly. On the 3rd August Schulenburgreported that Molotov though still showing signs of distrust had come out ofhis &quot; reserve &quot; and had shown &quot; visible interest &quot; in a definite German offer tocome to an understanding over Poland and the Baltic States. On the 3rd Augustalso the charge d&apos;affaires at Berlin informed Schnurre that he had received a reply from Molotov to his report of the conversations of the 27th. July. Molotovwanted something &quot; concrete &quot; from the German side. On the 12th August theday on which the Anglo-Franco-Soviet military talks opened in Moscow thecharge d&apos;affaires told Schnurre that he had instructions from Molotov to saythat the Soviet Government would be interested in opening discussions on certain categories of questions, including the Polish problem and former Russo-Germanpolitical treaties. They wanted the discussions to be held in Moscow and left itto the German Government to decide whether the Germans would carry on thediscussions through their ambassador in Moscow or send a special representative to Moscow. Thus-before the military conversations had begun the russians had decided to make it clear that they would welcome a visit of Ribbentrop to moscow and they were open to a &quot; deal &quot; with Germany over Poland.On the 14th August Ribbentrop replied that he would come in person.Schulenburg gave this reply to Molotov on the 15th August. Molotov said thathe would report the reply at once&apos;to the Soviet Government. He asked whetherGermany would consider a Soviet-German non-aggression pact and also use herinfluence towards the improvement of Soviet-Japanese relations.The first definite mention in so many words-of a non-aggression pact thuscame from the Soviet side.Ribbentrop replied on the 16th August that Germany would (1) sign a non-aggression pact for 25 years, (2) join the Soviet Government in guaranteeing theBaltic States, (3) use her influence in the desired sense with Japan. Ribbentroptold Schulenburg to do everything possible to hurry up his visit. He wanted tocome at once. It appears likely, from other evidence, that the German attackon Poland was planned for the 26th August.On the 17th August Schulenburg found that, while Molotov was entirelywilling to go on with the negotiations, he did not want Ribbentrop to come untddetails had been worked out for a non-aggression pact and a secret protoool whichwould deal with Poland, &amp;c.This method of procedure did not suit German plans, and on the night ofthe 18th-19th August Schulenburg was again instructed to do his utmost to accelerate the visit. He saw Molotov at 2 p.m. on the 19th August. Molotovstuck to his point, and Schulenburg went away disappointed after an hour&apos;stalk.   Half an hour later he was again summoned to the Kremlin.   Molotov now
said that the Soviet Government saw no reason against Ribbentrop coming a weekafter the announcement of the signature of the trade agreement, i.e., if the agree-ment were announced on the 20th August, the visit might take place on the 26thor 27th August. &quot; &apos;There are no telegrams for the 20th or 21st August. (We may yet find some.The captured documents about 400 tons of Foreign Office documents alone arein much confusion after several hasty moves by people not used to transferringarchives.) The last telegrams the 22nd August deal with details of Ribben-trop&apos;s journey, &amp;c.A longer summary of these documents is printed as Appendix A.2. Ribbentrop&apos;s interview with Stalin after the signature of the Non-A ggressionPact on 23rd August, 1939.The pact and secret protocol partitioning Poland were signed within a few hours of Ribbentrop&apos;s arrival. He then had an interview with Stalin. The record of this interview, which covered a number of questions, is printed as Appendix B.The German record was kept a close secret and is in untyped MS. form. It is interesting that Stalin agreed with Ribbentrop that England was weak andwanted others to fight for her arrogant claim to world domination. If Englanddominated the world, this fact was due to the stupidity of other countries whoallowed themselves to be bluffed. It was ridiculous that a few hundred English-men should control India.3. Molotov&apos;s visit to Berlin, November 1940.This visit seems to have been partly the result of Ribbentrop&apos;s vanity. hewart  anted to get Molotov (he even suggested Stalin) to come to Berlin as a return forhis own visit to Moscow in 1939. He failed to arrange a meeting in March 1940,and tried again in September. He took the line that England was now brokenand suggested a discussion over the spoils.A summary of these conversations is printed in Appendix C. The effect ofRibbentrop&apos;s &quot; pep talk &quot; about the collapse of England was a little marred bythe facts that most of the conversations were cut short by air raid warnings andthat the last conversation took place in Ribbentrop&apos;s private air raid shelterduring an R.A.F. raid on Berlin. It is interesting that Hitler wTas at this timetalking of &quot; Hemisphere defence &quot; against America, though he said that thedanger would not materialise until 1970-80. He wanted, obviously, to insurehimself against a possible Russian attack when delivering his grand assault onEngland in the spring of .1941. Molotov, however, did not rise to any of Hitler&apos;sor Ribbentrop&apos;s offers. He agreed on the general principles put forward, but was evidently determined to await events before committing himself. It is alsoclear that he regarded Russia as threatened through the Dardanelles by a Britishoccupation of Greece and that the Soviet Government considered Russiandomination of Bulgaria, with Bulgarian access to the ^aegean, as a necessaryguarantee of any revised Montreux agreement.E.

APPENDIX A.Summary of negotiations (17th April-mh August) preceding the conclusion ofthe Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact of 23rd August, 1939.(Por purposes of comparison, certain important stages in the Anglo-Franco-Soviet negotiations have been included under their respective dates. thesereferences are distinguished by square brackets.) All other material istaken from captured German documents.17th April-Soviet Ambassador in Berlin visited Weizsacker (StateSecretary, German Foreign Office) and raised the question of Russo-german relations. The Ambassador said that Russian policy had always been straight-forward, and that ideological considerations need not affect Russo-german relations. Russia had not exploited and did not wish to exploit in an anti-German sense the present differences between Germany and the Westerndemocracies.18th April-[Litvinov gave Seeds Soviet reply to British proposal for adeclaration by the Soviet Government with regard, to Soviet assistance in theevent of aggression against any one of their European neighbours. The SovietGovernment rejected the proposal and suggested a 5-10 years non-aggression pact.]1th May. [Molotov succeeded Litvinov as Kommissar for Foreign Affairs.]11th May--[Soviet Government again insisted to His Majesty&apos;s Governmenton (a) a non-aggression pact, with a guarantee&apos; of the Central and eastern european States, including Latvia, Estonia and Finland, and (b) a &quot; concrete&quot;Anglo-Franco-Soviet agreement as to the form and extent of the assistance to beprovided under (a).]17th May. [Sir R. Vansittart showed M. Maisky the text of a draft agree-ment which His Majesty&apos;s Government would be willing to accept.]17th May. Astachov, Soviet Charge d&apos;Affaires in Berlin, told Schnurre(who was in charge of trade talks between the German and Soviet Governments)that there was no reason for any conflict of interests between Russia and Germany.The Soviet Union felt itself threatened by Germany, but these feelings of mistrustcould be removed. The Charge d&apos;Affaires mentioned the Treaty of Rapallo andalso a statement by Mussolini, after the formation of the Axis, that there was no obstacle to the development of normal Russo-Italian relations. The Charged&apos;Affaires also said that the Anglo-Russian negotiations seemed unlikely toproduce the results for which England was hoping.18th May. &apos;[Maisky informed His Majesty&apos;s Government that Sovietregarded British proposals as insufficient.]19th May. New chief of the press section of the Commissariat for ForeignAffairs told German press representatives in Moscow that he hoped for animprovement in Russo-German relations since Russian policy had taken a newline (auf neues Gleis).20th May. Molotov told Schulenburg (German Ambassador at Moscow) that soviet Government regarded the resumption of Russo-German economic negotia-tions as inopportune until a political basis had been found for them.21st May. [Discussion between Halifax and Maisky at Geneva.]21st May.-Weizsacker instructed Schulenburg that as a result of &quot; feelers &quot;with Molotov German policy should be to wait and see whether the Russianswanted to &quot;go on.&apos;&apos;22nd May.--Schulenburg wrote to Weizsacker that Molotov did not regard the resumption of economic negotiations as a sufficient political gesture and thathe clearly wanted further offers of a political kind from Germany. It would benecessary to be extremely cautious until it could be certain that any approachesfrom the German side were not used merely to put pressure on England andFrance. On the other hand, if Germany wanted to get results, sooner or later somedemarche would be necessary.1 2Qth May. Draft of instructions from Ribbentrop to Schulenburg. (i) SinceAnglo-Russian negotiations were likely to lead to some positive result, Germanvmust come out of her reserve. Schulenburg was therefore told to see Molotov assoon as possible and to explain : (a)&apos; That German policy had been and would remain opposed to Communist tendencies inside Germany, but that, if the SovietGovernment did not interfere in German internal affairs,&apos;Russo-German relationsmight take a new shape, (b) It appeared, e.g., from Stalin&apos;s speech in March-that Russia also had these considerations in mind,   (c) In such case, there would
be no conflict of interests between Russia and Germany, and German-Russianrelations could be put on a &quot; normal &quot; basis, (d) The alliance with Italy, which formed the basis of German policy, was directed against England and France,and not against Russia. German relations with Japan, though &quot; historically &quot;on an anti-Komintern basis, really rested on common opposition to England, and need not imply hostility to Russia, (e) The problems of Danzig and the Corridormust be settled. If the solution required war with Poland, there need be noconflict of interests with Russia. From a military point of view Poland was nota problem, and a military decision could be reached with such speed that Anglo-French help to Poland would be &quot; illusory.&quot; (/) There were reasons to doubt whether England and France intended, in the last resort, to intervene on the sideof Poland, but anyhow their intervention would not affect the settlement of thePolish question, (g) Russia had nothing to gain from participating in theEnglish &apos;&apos; Einkreisungspolitik.&apos;&apos; In view of the fact that England could not bring help to Russia either in Europe owing to the West Wall or in the far east owing to Japanese naval superiority in Far Eastern waters Englishpolicy was simply on the traditional line of getting other Powers to pull thechestnuts out of the fire for her. (h) Germany therefore considered it necessaryto warn Russia that, if she joined England and France in an anti-German bloc,she would bring on herself the enmity of Germany and Japan, (i) On the otherhand, there was no reason why the mutual lack of confidence between Russia andGermany should not be overcome. A possible method of improvement would be through economic negotiations leading to an official statement about the political&quot;normalisation&quot; of Russo-German relations. The stages in this procedurewere matters for discussion, (j) Italy and Japan had been informed generallyof thia demarche. (These instructions do not appear to have been sent toSchulenburg. Apparently it was decided by Hitler that the demarche should bemade in Berlin.)27th May.  [Molotov raised objections to formula proposed by His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. ]30th May. With Hitler&apos;s approval Weizacker reminded the Russian Charged&apos;Affaires of the Ambassadors conversation of the 17th April and then madea statement to the Charge d&apos;Affaires on the lines of Ribbentrop&apos;s draft instruc-tions to Schulenburg.2nd June.

This treaty had been prolonged indefinitely in May 1933. Clause 2 ran as follows : &quot; Shouldone of the contracting parties .... be attacked by a third Power or severalPowers, the other contracting party will observe neutrality throughout the wholeduration of the conflict.&quot;7th June. [His Majesty&apos;s Government decided to recall Sir W. Seeds for consultation. Owing to Sir W. Seeds&apos;s illness, Mr. Strang was sent to Moscow.Negotiations continued on Soviet demands with regard to Baltic States and the definition of &quot; non-aggression.&quot;]17th June. Schulenburg (while on leave in Berlin) asked the RussianCharge d&apos;Affaires why no answer had been made to Weizsacker&apos;s demarche ofthe 30th May. The Charge d&apos;Affaires said that an answer would be given toSchulenburg in Moscow, but that Weizsacker&apos;s statement seemed very vague.Schulenburg replied that Molotov&apos;s remarks had been vague but that Wiezsacker&apos;sstatement was quite clear. Russia had to choose (i.e., between Germany and england).28th June. On his return to Moscow Schulenburg saw Molotov. Schulen-burg said that, as Wiezsacker had explained, Germany would welcome a&apos;&apos; normalisation &apos;&apos; of Russo-German relations.

He was glad to know that the Berlin Treaty was still in force, because the Soviet Govern-ment had been doubtful about it.

Schulenburg thought that the Soviet Government was greatly interested inknowing the German attitude and maintaining contact. Molotov was obviouslyvery distrustful but said that the &quot; normalisation &quot; of Russo-German relationswas desirable and possible. (Hitler appears to have ordered on the 29th Junethat the Russians should be told that the discussions about the resumption ofeconomic negotiations should be broken off because the Russian conditions wereunacceptable.)(The German Ambassador in Paris reported on the 29th June information from a source generally reliable (i) that the Kpmintern was being more and more pushed into the background,and the Politburo which had &quot;national-imperialist&quot; ideas-was taking its place;&apos;(ii) Russia was being dominated by four men, Zdanov, Molotov, Andriev andVoroshilov. Stalin was being kept uninformed by these men and was becoming more a &apos;&apos; living monument &quot; ;(iii) the Anglo-French negotiators did not realise this position;(iv) Russian policy was directed towards a &quot; free hand &quot; and the &quot; GreatRussian &quot; aims required neutrality in the event of war, with the idea of using the unweakened power of Russia to extract concessions from the exhausted victorsafter the war.)30th June. Schulenburg instructed by Weizsacker that Ribbentrop con-sidered that for the present enough had been said about the political question andthat this question should not, for the time, be raised again from the Germanside.9th July. [Molotov insisted tnat the Anglo-Franco-Soviet military agree-ment should be signed simultaneously with the political agreement, i.e., he would agree to initial the political agreement, but military conversations would then take place, and the military agreement would be drawn up and signed with thepolitical agreement.]21st July. Announcement of resumption of Russso-German trade conver-sations.21th July. Soviet Charge&apos; d&apos;Affaires in Berlin asked Weizsacker whetherthe German Government would accept an invitation to send two German repre-sentatives to the first great agricultural exhibition in Russia.25th July.  [Maisky told that His Majesty&apos;s Government agreed to theopening of military conversations in Moscow.]27th July. Soviet invitation of the 24th July accepted by German Govern-ment.27th July.-Schnurre had a long discussion in Berlin with the RussianCharge d&apos;Affaires and Barbarin (leader of the Russian delegation for trade dis-cussions). Schnurre (who was acting under instructions from , Ribbentrop)repeated the German view that these stages were necessary to restore the formerclose collaboration between Russia and Germany.(i) Renewal of economic collaboration.(ii) &quot; Normalisation &quot; and improvement of political relations (press, &amp;c).(iii) Restoration of good political relations, either by a revival of the BerlinTreaty (i.e., of 1926) or by a new arrangement based on recognition ofthe vital political interests of each country.Stage (iii) was possible because there were no real Russo-German conflictsof interest anywhere from the Baltic to the Black Sea and the Far East. Therewas also a common &quot; ideological &quot; basis in Russian and German opposition to thecapitalist democracies. Astachov and Barbarin agreed with enthusiasm.Astachov said that the tempo would have to be slow. Schnurre said that german policy was directed against England. This point was decisive, and a Russo-German rapprochement would be impossible after Russia had ranged herselfagainst Germany by a pact with England. What could England offer Russia?At best, participation in a European war and the emnity of Germany not avery desirable aim for Russia.What, on the other hand, could Germany offer Russia ? Neutrality and non-participation in a European war, and, if Moscow wished, a Russo-German under-standing on the material interests of the two countries.Astachov said that Danzig would return in some way or another to the Reichand the question of the Corridor must be settled in favour of the Reich.
Schnurre said that the Germans regarded the character of Bolshevism assomewhat changed since it had become blended with Russian national history and Stalin postponed the international revolution to the Greek Kalends.Finally, Astachov said that the conversation had been most valuable andthat he would report it to Moscow.29th July. In a note of the 29th July to Schulenburg summarising the con-versation Weizsacker added the important point (not in Schnurre&apos;s report) thatAstachov asked whether, in the event of a highly-placed Soviet personality dis-cussing the questions with a highly-placed German personality, the Germanview would be as represented by Schnurre. Schnurre had answered &quot; Yes.&quot;Schulenburg was therefore instructed to sound Molotov and to try to get him outof his reserve. If he succeeded, he should go a step further and explain thatGermany would respect Russian interests in any settlement (peaceful or otherwise)of the Polish question, and was ready to come to an understanding on the subject with Russia.   Germany would also respect Russian interests in the Baltic.2nd August.  [Molotov (i) complained to Sir W. Seeds about the terms ofMr. R. A. Butler&apos;s reference in the House of Commons to the independence ofthe Baltic States, (ii) continued to dispute British definition of &quot; non-aggression.&quot;Sir W. Seeds thought that &quot; Molotov was a different man from what he had been at our last interview &quot; and that the negotiations has received a severe set-back.]2nd August. Ribbentrop had a conversation with Astachov.   RibbentropI   more or less repeated Schnurre&apos;s statements but in a rather bullying manner,j  Ribbentrop said he would go into details if Soviet Government formally statedI their wish to put Russo-German relations on a new basis.S 3rd August. Schulenburg had 1^-hour conversation with Molotov. he told Molotov, who had come out of his &apos;&apos; reserve&apos;&apos; and was unusually &apos;c open,&apos;&apos;I that he had been instructed to confirm everything Schnurre had said to Astachov.I The German Government believed that an arrangement of interests was possibleI  and invited the Soviet Government to express their opinion.Molotov answered point by point. (1) The Soviet Government wanted aS trade agreement. (2) The press in each country should avoid anything likely toj disturb mutual relations. (3) The gradual resumption of cultural relations wasI desirable. (4) The Soviet also wanted an improvement in Russo-German political relations. In a discussion whether Germany or Russia had been responsible forI the deterioration in these relations, Molotov said, inter alia, that the German! Government had refused to take part in international conferences at which theI Soviet Government was represented. He quoted the Munich conference as ani  example.Schulenburg said that they would do better to find a way towards improve-I ment rather than to discuss the past. Molotov said that the Soviet government  was ready to join in looking for a way to improve Russo-German relations, butI  they wanted proof of a change in the German attitude.   They then discussed theBaltic and Polish questions. Molotov asked whether Lithuania was included inj the countries in which Germany would respect Russian interests. SchulenburgI  does not report his answer.   He told Molotov that Germany was ready to respectRussian interests with regard to&apos; Poland and to come to an understanding overthe matter with the Soviet Government. Molotov showed &apos;&apos; visible interest &apos;&apos;I but replied that a peaceful solution (i.e., of the Polish question) dependedI principally on Germany.After further discussion Molotov promised to report the conversation to theSoviet Government and repeated that Russia wanted a &apos;&apos; normalisation andi improvement&apos;&apos; of relations with Germany.Schulenburg thought that, in spite of this increased readiness to improve\ Russo-German relations, the Soviet Government was resolved to join England&apos; and France if these Powers accepted all the Soviet conditions. Anyhow the; negotiations would be prolonged because Russia was also distrustful of England.3rd August. Schnurre had another discussion with Astachov. SchnurreI suggested that the political question might be brought into the preamble of theI trade agreement or into a secret protocol. Astachov was much interested in this\ suggestion. Molotov had replied to his report of his (Astachov&apos;s) interview ofi the 27th July that he was much interested, and also considered a trade agreement the first step towards the improvement of political relations.     Molotov said,however, that hitherto there had been nothing &quot;concrete&quot; from the German; side.   Schnurre said that the German Government was waiting for some official statement from Moscow that &quot; concrete &quot; suggestions were desired.   They also thought that the talks should be continued in Berlin.
12th August. -[Anglo-French military mission begin conversations withRussians in Moscow.]12th A ugust. 1Astachov told Schnurre that he had received instructions fromMolotov to state that the Soviet Government would be interested in opening dis-cussions on certain categories of questions, including the Polish problem andformer Russo-German political treaties. The discussions would have to proceed by stages, and the Soviet Government would like to hold them in Moscow.Astachov left it open whether the German representative would be the ambassadoror &apos;&apos; some other person to be sent&apos;&apos; to Moscow.14th August. Ribbentrop instructed Schulenburg to tell Molotov that hewas prepared to come to Moscow on behalf of the Fiihrer to explain the latter&apos;view to Stalin. (This offer was to be made verbally to Molotov. If necessary,Schulenburg was to ask for an interview with Stalin.)14th August.  [Voroshilov asked Military Missions whether Soviet troops would be allowed to move against Germany through Polish territory and to useRoumanian territory in the event of aggression against Roumania. military mission replied that this question was political and that they must consult their governments.]14th August. [Article in Pravcla stating that &quot; the war of the Soviet Unionagainst fascism will be the mast just and lawful of all the wars of humanity.&apos;&apos;]15th August. Schulenburg saw Molotov. Molotov agreed to tell Stalin atonce of Ribbentrop&apos;s proposal. He said that Scbulenburg&apos;s communication was so important that he could not answer it without consulting the Soviet Govern-ment. He could say only that the Soviet Government would welcome the Germanmove to improve relations with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Government was now convinced that the Germans really wanted this improvement. Molotovreferred to reports received via Ciano in June 1939 that Germany was readyto sign a non-aggression pact with Russia and to join the Soviet Government ina guarantee to the Baltic States. Molotov asked (irrespective of the truth ofthis earlier report) whether Germany would consider a non-aggression pact andwould use her influence for the improvement of Russo-Japanese relations.Schulenburg asked Molotov whether he was to understand that the Soviet Govern-ment desired these questions to be discussed during Ribbentrop&apos;s visit. Molotovsaid he could give only a provisional answer to the question of Ribbentrop&apos;s visit,but that it was necessary to prepare the ground in advance so that the conversa-tions would lead to positive results. He repeated &quot;his view that, if the GermanGovernment were ready to agree to a non-aggression pact, the negotiations shouldbe given concrete form.16th August. Ribbentrop instructed Schulenburg to tell Molotov thatGermany was willing (a) to negotiate a non-aggression pact for 25 years, (b) tojoin the U.S.S.R. in guaranteeing the Baltic States, \c) to use her influencetowards the improvement of Russo-Japanese relations. The Fiihrer consideredthat a full settlement of Russo-German relations should take place quickly inview of the possibility of serious events. (Schulenburg was. instructed to tellMolotov that Germany could not continue indefinitely to put up with provocationfrom Poland.) Ribbentrop was therefore prepared to fly to Moscow at any time after the 18th August with full powers from Hitler to negotiate and sign a treaty.Schulenburg was instructed confidentially that it was of particular importance that his journey to Moscow should take place at the end of the week. (16th Augustwas a Wednesday) or early in the following week.11 th August. Schulenburg read these latest instructions to Molotov. With-out discussing them, Molotov said that he would give the official answer of theSoviet Government to Schulenburg&apos;s proposal of the 15th August that Ribbentropshould come to Moscow. The official answer stated that until recently the SovietGovernment had considered German policy to be hostile to the U.S.S.R., andhad therefore been compelled to take counter-measures against possible german aggression and to participate in the organisation of a defensive front with anumber of other States against such aggression. If German policy had undergonea.change in the direction of an improvement of relations with the U.S.S.R., theSoviet Government would welcome this new course and modify its own policy itithe direction of an improvement of relations with Germany.The Soviet Government had never had any aggressive intentions towards germany, and had always considered it possible to reach a peaceful solution of differences with Germany. The conditions existed therefore for successfulpractical steps towards the improvement of relations.The Soviet Government suggested as a first step the conclusion of a trade agreement, and, as a second step (to follow shortly after the first) the conclusion
of a non-aggression pact or the confirmation of the neutrality agreement of 1926,together with a special protocol defining the interests of the contracting parties invarious questions of foreign policy and forming an integral part of the pact.Molotov added that in contrast with England, which had sent only a sub-ordinate official to Moscow, the decision to send so outstanding a politician andstatesman as Ribbentrop showed the seriousness of the German intentions. Forthis reason careful preparation would be needed before the visit took place.Schulenburg asked whether the communication which he had just made,would not hasten matters, but Molotov did not think that the Soviet answerwould be modified in any important particular. He suggested that each sideshould get to work on the drafts of a non-aggression pact, or on the revival of the neutrality treaty, and on the protocol.17 th August.-\Military conversations adjourned until the 21st August.]ISth August. In reply to his report of this interview Schulenburg was instructed by Ribbentrop to see Molotov at once and to say that in normal circum-stances. the German Government would agree to the preparation of the newTdefinition of German-Soviet relations through the usual diplomatic channels.Hitler considered, however, that owing to the situation with regard to Poland,an immediate discussion was necessary in order to secure that, in the event of warwith Poland, Germany could take account of Russian interests. The trade agree-ment was being signed at once; the second stage would therefore be reachedimmediately, and Ribbentrop&apos;s visit could take place forthwith. The Germanproposals for a non-aggression pact were&apos; extremely simple : a pact of twoarticles, viz. : *(1) Germany and the U.S.S.R. will in no case go to war with each other orproceed to any other measures involving the use of force.(2) This treaty comes into force at once and has a duration of 25 years.Ribbentrop could explain details in Moscow and meet the Russian wishesabout a protocol.IQth August. Schulenburg saw Molotov at 2 p.m. and tried in an hour&apos;sconversation to persuade him that an immediate visit by Ribbentrop was theonly way of securing the acceleration necessary in view of the political situation.Molotov, however, insisted that it was still not possible to fix a date forRibbentrop&apos;s visit because careful preparation was essential. The German draft was not sufficient. The Soviet Government wanted the pact to be in line withother Soviet non-aggression pacts. They also wanted to know details about the protocol. Molotov added some pointed remarks about the seriousness with whichthe Soviet Government regarded agreements signed by them.Schulenburg repeated his arguments, but Mclotov was unmoved. Half an hour later Schulenburg was asked to see Molotov again (at 4-30 p.m.). At this second visit Molotov said that he had been authorised to give Schulenburg thedraft of a non-aggression pact, and to say that the Soviet Government agreed thatRibbentrop should come to Moscow a week after the announcement of the signature of the trade agreement, i.e.. if this agreement were announced on the 20th August,Ribbentrop could come on the 26th or 27th August.Schulenburg reported that Molotov gave no reasons for this sudden changeof attitude. He thought that Stalin must have intervened. He (Schulenburg)tried to get an earlier date than the 26th-27th August but did not succeed.The Soviet draft was longer than the German draft. The duration of the pact was fixed for 5 years unless either party had given a year&apos;s notice of non-venewal. A reference was made to the protocol &quot;over the points on which the contracting parties were interested in the field of foreign policy.&quot; There was a clause pledging each party, in the event of an attack on the other by a third party,to give no support of any kind to the third party.[There were no further telegrams of the 19th, 20th or 21st August dealingwith Ribbentrop&apos;s visit. The file includes telegrams of the 22nd August aboutRibbentrop&apos;s time of arrival, explanations with the Japanese, and a general state-rnent, for publication, of the reasons for the change in German.policy.][30776]c
APPENDIX B.Conversation between Ribbentrop, Stalin anal Molotov during the night of23rd/21th August.,Japan.Ribbentrop explained that the close relations between Germany and Japanwere in no way directed against the Soviet Union. On the contrary, thanks toGermany&apos;s good relations with Japan, she was in a position to contribute to asettlement of the differences between the Soviet Union and Japan: Ribbentropwas prepared to work to this end if Stalin and the Soviet Government desiredit. He would take steps to influence the Japanese Government accordingly and remain in communication with the Russian representative in Berlin on thesubject.Stalin replied that although the Soviet Union desired an improvement in relations with Japan, there were limits to its patience where Japanese provocationwas concerned. If Japan wanted peace, so much the better. Stalin consideredGerman co-operation towards an improvement of Russo-Japanese relations tobe useful, but did not wish the Japanese to get the impression that the initiative in this matter had come from the Soviet Union.Ribbentrop agreed, and pointed out that his co-operation would only mean the continuation of conversations which he had been having for months withthe Japanese Ambassador in Berlin with a view to an improvement in Russo-Japanese relations. There would, therefore be no question of a new initiative inthis matter even on the German side.Italy.Stalin asked Ribbentrop what Italy&apos;s intentions were. Had not Italy furtheraspirations beyond the annexation of Albania perhaps to Greek territory?Albania which was small, mountainous and only thinly populated was, in hisopinion, of no special value to Italy.Ribbentrop replied that Albania was important to Italy for strategicalreasons. In any case Mussolini was a strong man who was not to be intimidated.He had proved this in the course of the Abyssinian war in which Italy had gained her ends by her own strength against an enemy coalition. Even germany was at that time not yet in a position to give Italy any notable degree of support.Mussolini welcomed the re-establishment of friendly relations between germany and the Soviet Union. He had said he was very pleased at the signing of the Non-Aggression Pact.Turkey.Stalin asked Ribbentrop what was Germany&apos;s opinion of Turkey.Ribbentrop replied that he had informed the Turkish Government somemonths ago that Germany wished for friendly relations with Turkey. He had himself done everything possible to achieve this end. Turkey had replied by beingone of the first countries to join in the encirclement of Germany, and had not evenconsidered it necessary to notify the German Government.Stalin and Molotov remarked that the Soviet Union had also had unfortunateexperiences with the vagaries of Turkish politics.Ribbentrop went on to say that England had spent 5 million pounds inTurkey on propaganda against Germany.Stalin remarked that the sum for which Turkish politicians had sold them-selves to England was, according to his information, considerably more than5 million pounds.England.Stalin and Molotov spoke unfavourably of the British Military Mission in moscow, which had never told the Soviet Government exactly what it wanted.Ribbentrop then said that England had always tried and was still trying to hinder the development of good relations between Germany and the soviet union. England was weak and wanted to let others fight for her arrogant claimto world domination.
Stalin expressed strong agreement, and added that the British army wasweak; and that even the British Navy was no longer as important as it had been.The R.A.F. was certainly being expanded, but there was a shortage of pilots.If England nevertheless dominated the world that was the result of the stupidityof other countries, who continually allowed themselves to be bluffed. It was, forexample, ridiculous that a few hundred Englishmen should control India.Ribbentrop agreed and informed Stalin confidentially that England had recently put out a few feelers, accompanied by certain references to 1914. Thismanoeuvre was typical of British stupidity. He had suggested to the Fuhrerthat the British should be told that in the event of a German-Polish conflictGermany would reply to any hostile British action by bombing London.Stalin presumed that he must be referring to the letter from Chamberlainto the Fuhrer which Henderson had delivered at the Obersalzburg on the23rd August. He added that in spite of her weakness, England would wagewar with cunning and determination.France.Stalin said that France still possessed a considerable army.Ribbentrop pointed out the numerical inferiority of France; while germany could count on more than 300,000 soldiers in each age group France could onlycall up 150,000 recruits each year. The West Wall was five times as strong as theMaginot Line! If France wished to make war on Germany she would be beatenin any case.The Anti-Comintern Pact.Ribbentrop said that the Anti-Comintern Pact had been directed basicallynot against the Soviet Union but against the Western Democracies. He knew him-self, and could see also from Russian press opinion, that the Soviet Governmenthad properly recognised this fact.Stalin interposed that the Anti-Comintern Pact bad indeed chiefly scaredthe City of London and little British tradesmen.Ribbentrop agreed and remarked jokingly that Stalin had certainly been lessscared than they had been. What the German people thought could be gathered from a joke, invented by the Berliners (whose wit and humour was well known),which had been going round for some months. This was that &quot; Stalin himself would be joining the Anti-Comintern Pact next.&quot;Attitude of the German People to the German-Russian Non-Aggression Pact.Ribbentrop said that he could confirm that all sections of the German popula-tion, and in particular the more humble people, welcomed most warmly the under-standing with the Soviet Union. The people felt instinctively that there could beno natural differences of opinion between Germany and the Soviet Union, andthat the development of good relations had up to now only been prevented by themachinations of other countries, particularly England.Stalin replied that he gladly believed this. The Germans wished for peace and therefore welcomed friendly relations between the Reich and the soviet union.Ribbentrop here interposed that it was certainly true that the German peoplewished for peace; but, on the other hand, indignation against Poland was so great that every single man was ready for battle. The German people would nolonger put up with Polish provocation.[Stalin and Molotov then proposed toasts to Hitler, Ribbentrop and Schulen-burg, &amp;c, which were returned by Ribbentrop.]Molotov remarked that it was Stalin who, by his speech in March of this year,which had been well understood in Germany, had initiated the improvement in political relations.Stalin finally took his leave and said that the Soviet Government took thenew pact very seriously, and pledged his word that the Soviet Union would notbetray its partner.[30776]
APPENDIX C.Analysis of Conversations during Molotov&apos;s. Visit to Berlin in November 1940.(The German records cover 100 pp. of typescript.)First Conversation between Ribbentrop and Molotov (consisted generally of amonologue by Ribbentrop).He began by saying that many things (as described in the letter to Stalin)had happened since Ribbentrop&apos;s visit to Moscow and the signing of the protocolsat the end of the Polish campaign. He then delivered a &quot; pep talk &quot; on thefollowing lines : Britain was broken and it was only a matter of time beforeshe would sue for peace; invasion had been held up owing to the weather, but would be carried out when the weather improved; air attacks continued by day and night; U-boat attacks were now beginning to reach their planned scale; verylittle chance of United States entry into the war, but Germany would not care if she did. There was no possibility of a successful landing of British forces inEurope; and Churchill was a political and military dilettante who had alwaysfailed in the past and would fail again.Germany&apos;s interest was to end as soon as possible the war which she hadalready won, and she was anxious to exchange views with other States whichhad similar wishes.(1) Germany hoped for a Soviet declaration of solidarity with the three powers who had signed the Axis Pact. This pact did not prejudice in any wayrelations between the Axis and Russia, and Germany hoped in particular, by her mediation, to establish better relations between Russia and Japan.(2) Hitler wished to reach a definition of the spheres of interest of the threeA\ocis Powers and Russia respectively. Japan&apos;s natural direction of expansion wassouthwards towards South-East Asia, Italy&apos;s was the Mediterranean and Northand North-East Africa, Germany&apos;s towards Central Africa, and that of russia would surely be also southwards, giving access to the sea in the Persian Gulf.(3) Germany, who had no territorial claims against Turkey, wished turkey to cut herself free from the British alliance and to come nearer to Russia andGermany. The Montreux Convention, like the Danube Commission, would haveto be revised and would provide for special privileges for Russia.(4) Germany hoped to proceed further with these plans by means of a Pour-Power meeting in Moscow, if this was Stalin&apos;s desire.(5) She wished to assist, if possible, in making peace between Japan and china.In reply, Molotov said that Russia would welcome a Sino-Japanese settlement,and a general discussion with Germany. Russia would like, however, to be clearon points of detail before agreeing to the four-Power discussions : -(1) Clarification of the significance, character and object of the Three-PowerPact.(2) Definition of the phrase &quot; Greater East Asia.&quot;(3) Greater exactitude in defining spheres of influence.Detailed discussions would be necessary before a permanent settlement could bereached.First Conversation beUveen Hitler and Molotov, 12th November, 1940.Hitler said he wished to avoid all possible causes of friction and conflict,especially between two countries which by their form of authoritarian govern-ment were so suited to understand one another. He wished for the continuation of the already fruitful Russo-German co-operation, and though 100 per cent,agreement might not be possible, it would be a great advantage to reach 20 or25 per cent, degree of agreement.(1) The ivar had extended in certain directions which Germany had not intended and ivhere she had no political interests.(2) Germany was in absohote need of certain raw materials (some modification in Germany&apos;s favour of the areas in Eastern Europe allotted to the two countries was therefore necessary, comparable to Germany&apos;s renunciation of Lithuania inthe interests of Russia and of the South Tyrol in the interests of Italy).
(3) Germany could not allow enemy bases to be established in certain areas,i.e., the British in Greece.(4) Germany had no colonial aspirations in Asia, only in Central Africa.(5) Germany had already reached a definition of spheres of influence in western Europe with Italy and France, and her interest in the Balkans waspurely one of raw materials for the duration of the war.(6) &quot; Hemisphere Defence.&quot;Germany saw great danger to the rest of the world coming from America in about the period 1970-1980. European countries should organise to prevent theestablishment of Anglo-Saxon bases. In particular, the British must be prevented from securing a base at Saloni threat to Roumanian oil, and germany would welcome a definition by Russia of Russian interests in the Black Sea andthe Dardanelles.Molotov was in general agreement with the general objectives described. The1939 agreement had. been of mutual advantage, and the exchange of Lithuaniaagainst the Lublin area had removed all sources of friction except one, that isFinland. He repeated that the Soviet Government expected clarifications on moi*econcrete questions, such as the significance of the Three-Power Pact and the definition of &quot; Greater East Asia.&quot;Hitler replied that the Three Powers who signed the Pact wished todecide post-war questions not only for Western Europe (this had already beendone) but, in co-operation with Russia, as regards Eastern Europe and Asia.The problem of co-operation between Germany, Italy and France had beensolved; he now wanted to discuss with Russia the questions of the Black Sea,the Balkans and Turkey. Germany wished to mediate in the Far eastern question between Russia and Japan.Molotov agreed in principle to Russian co-operation as an equal partnerwith the Three Powers, but the questions at issue must be more clearly denned.Second Conversation between Hitler and Molotov, 13th November, 1940.The conversation opened with a lengthy sparring match. There were two questions at issue (1) Whether Russia or Germany had gained more advantages from the modifications (Lublin against Lithuania and the cession of NorthernBukovina) which had been made to the 1939 protocol.(2) Finland.Finland.Hitler said that the secret protocol had defined zones of influence, not ofoccupation, in Finland, that Germany had no political interest in Finland, had sent no troops to occupy any part of the country and though some had passed through on their way to Kirkenes no further contingents would be sent.Germany had an economic interest in deliveries of nickel and timber from finland, and a general interest in keeping the war away from the Baltic (fearof the establishment of British bases in Finland).Molotov said that Finland was a question which might poison Russo-German relations, as Russia did not wish German troops to be kept there, nor should anti-Soviet demonstrations be allowed. The Soviet Union desired adefinite final settlement on the Finnish question under the terms of the 1939Agreement. He evaded answering Hitler&apos;s question tvhether Russia intendedto go to war with Finland. Neither Russia nor Germany had, however, boundtheir hands over Finland and peace in the Baltic could be absolutely assuredif full clarity existed on the question of Fin)and between Russia and Germany.Russia intended to treat Finland in the same way as she had Bessarabia.Hitler said that Germany would intervene, but very unwillingly, if eitherFinland or Sweden became a base for the British or the United States. Shewished to avoid such intervention and intervention at Salonika was &quot;enough.&quot;A second Russo-Finnish Avar would not be in the interests of Russo-german relations and Hitler feared the possibility of America being involved owing to[support of Finland.
The discussion about Finland became at times heated, and Ribbentrop intervened and summed up by saying that (1) Finland was in the Russian zone of influence,(2) Germany had no connection with the anti-Soviet demonstrations,(3) she would co-operate with Russia over Finland in the interests of both countries.   There was perhaps no real problem, only a &quot; misunder-standing.&quot;Hitler then turned to the real purpose of the conversation, the carving-tip ofthe British Empire. The key of the problem was the end of resistance in theUnited Kingdom, which Hitler expected before long, after which the Empirewould collapse. He did not believe resistance could continue, directed, e.g., from canada. He wished the clarification of Russia&apos;s attitude to the question of worldspheres of influence.(1) Hitler wished to avoid an unnecessary outward spread of the war away from areas essential for the attack on the United Kingdom. He was displeased atthe Italian attack on Greece.(2) He wished to establish a world coalition. He had no wish to annexFrance, and had solved the question of Western Europe in spite of Franco-Spanishdifficulties in respect of North Africa by establishing a coalition between France,Spain and the Axis. He hoped to make a similar arrangement in the East withRussia over the question of (a) Turkey, (5) Greater East Asia, and (c) Russia&apos;saccess to the sea in the middle eastern area.Molotov wished to know more about Germany&apos;s views on Turkey and theStraits.(1) Roumania&apos;s acceptance of an Axis guarantee without Russia havingbeen consulted had caused consternation in Russia, against whom the guaranteeappeared to be directed. Hitler explained that the guarantee had been necessaryto persuade Roumania to cede Bessarabia to Russia.(2) The Dardanelles were the historic British gate-way for attaching russian the Black Sea, and the danger was closer now that the British were established in Greece. (Hitler remarked that Ribbentrop had already suggested a revision ofthe Montreux Convention.)(3) Russia wished to guarantee Bulgaria in jhe same way as Germany hadguaranteed Roumania, since she wished to be secure against attack and would thus have to settle the question of the Straits with Turkey. Hitler enquire whether Bulgaria had asked for this guarantee, and would not Russian interestsin the Black Sea&apos; be adequately safeguarded by the revision of Montreux alone ?He was prepared to agree to an arrangement whereby Russian naval units andthose of no other Power should be allowed free access through the Straits.Molotov replied that a guarantee of Bulgaria (providing also for Bulgarian access to the JEgean) ivas an essential part of the Russian scheme. What was Germany&apos;attitude to this project?Hitler gave no definite reply and said he would have to consult Mussolini.He finished by saying that the main question of a definition of world spheres of influence would have to be discussed at Moscow after preparatory diplomaticdiscussion on particular points.Final Conversation between Ribbentrop and Molotov in Ribbentrop&apos;s Air RaidShelter, 13th November, 1940.Ribbentrop said that further and more exact definition was necessary on (1) The main lines of co-operation between the three Axis Powers and russia about their respective spheres of influence.(2) The question of Turkey.He therefore proposed that their ultimate objective should be a treaty often years&apos; duration on the following lines : Article 1 would contain a Russian declaration of solidarity with the signa-tories of the Three-Power agreement of the 27th September, 1940, in order toprevent an extension of the war and bring about an early peace.Article 2 would be a declaration by the Four Powers that they would mutuallyrespect one another&apos;s spheres of influence and would consult together on matters affecting these spheres.
Article 3 would be an undertaking by each of the Four Powers not to join orsupport any combination directed against any of the others. There might alsobs a secret protocol defining more closely the territorial aspirations of the four powers (generally on the lines of (2) in Ribbentrop&apos;s first conversation., though asuggestion was made here of limiting Japanese expansion by a line south of theJapanese Islands and Manchukuo; the definition of Japanese aspirations wouldbe clarified through diplomatic channels.) Finally, a second secret protocolsigned by Germany, Italy and Russia would contain a declaration of common interest in freeing Turkey from the British Alliance, and in obtaining herco-operation for the Axis.Ribbentrop made three further points: (a) Germany approved of the idea of a revision of the Montreux convention on the lines of (3) at the end of Hitler&apos;s last conversation.(&amp;) Germany hoped that Russo-Japanese relations might be improved bythe conclusion of a non-aggression pact as suggested by Japan.Japan would be ready to make concessions to Russia over naphtha and coal in Southern Sakhalin,(c) An understanding with the Axis Powers would also be possible about any aspirations which Russia might have in the direction of India.Molotov replied that (1) In spite of many difficulties the prospects of an understanding with japan now seemed better, but time was still necessary before negotia-tions could be concluded.(2) The Straits question was primarily one for direct negotiations with turkey. Montreux was worthless and something more than paper was necessary to guarantee Russian security. Russia was closelyinterested in Bulgaria, nor could she be indifferent to the fate of roumania and Hungary.(3) What were Axis intentions in Poland, Yugoslavia and Greece? Wasthe protocol still in force as regards Poland ?(4) Russia was also interested in Swedish neutrality. Did Germany wishto maintain it \(5) The question of the outlet from the Baltic (the Belts, Kattegat andSkagerrak). Russia considered that similar discussions wereindicated about this question as had taken place about the DanubeCommission.Ribbentrop evaded most of these questions saying that he had nothing to add to Hitler&apos;s remarks about Bulgaria, that it was not yet time to discussPoland again, that the Baltic was an internal sea in which Germany was interested in the freedom of navigation while the war raged outside in the atlantic.   He agreed, however, about Sweden.   He summed up by repeating (1) German interests in the Baltic were purely economic and directed toprevent British intervention. The German guarantee to roumania had been necessary to prevent immediate conflict between hungary and Roumania about Transylvania. (Note the difference from the reasongiven by Hitler.) Once peace had been made with Great Britain,Germany would withdraw her troops from Roumania. germany had no territorial interests in the Balkans(2) The main question was that of Russian co-operation in the liquidation of the British Empire. Russia and Germany should stand, not faceto face in possible opposition, but back to back in mutual support.(3) He would like to know whether Russia agreed basically with the ideaof southerly expansion towards the Indian Ocean.Molotov agreed to the main objective of co-operation, but wished forfurther detailed consultation. Pie remarked that a, definition of Russian andGerman spheres of influence was also necessary; but here he would give no definite answer until he had consulted &quot; Stalin and his other friends &quot; in Moscow.Finally, he thought that &quot; the questions of to-morrow could not be separated from those of to-day and the task that had already been begun should be finishedbefore these further questions could be discussed.&quot;Note to Appendix C.An interesting sequel to these conversations is an interview between hitler and the German Ambassador, Schulenburg, on the 28th April, 1941.   In this
conversation Schulenburg all the time emphasised his belief that Britishdiplomacy was making no headway at all with Russia, that Russia had nodesigns on Germany and that what had been mistaken for threats were merelysymptoms of the Russian mania for 300 per cent, security.Hitler, however, was extremely suspicious of Russia., considering inparticular (1) that the Russian Pact with Yugoslavia was an attempt to intimidateGermany and that Russia rather than England was probably behind the change of regime at Belgrade;(2) that Russian concentrations in the Baltic area were the beginning of hostile moves against Germany.Hitler had clearly lost any confidence in Russia, and said that duringMolotov&apos;s visit it had been easy to see how much hatred for Germany was stillalive in Russia, and that Russian intentions to encroach further in Finland andthe Dardanelles were unchanged.23rd October, 1945.\
