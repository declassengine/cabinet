It is issued for the personal use of................................................................OP SECRET Copy NCP. (45) 281.14th November, 1945.CABINET.THE INDIAN SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate (Annexure 1) for the urgent consideration of my colleagues, amemorandum which I have just received from the Viceroy analysing in graveterms the situation with which he is confronted in the light of the increasingviolence of the speeches of certain of the foremost Congress leaders. I also circulate (Annexure II), to be read with it, a letter from the Viceroy forwarding anote of his recent interview with Jawaharlal Nehru referred to in paragraph 5of the memorandum. In Annexure III I reproduce extracts of the speechesdelivered in recent weeks by Congress leaders.The Viceroy is convinced that the Congress leaders, as represented by Nehru,Vallabhbhai Patel, Asaf Ali, and Pant, contemplate resort sooner or later to force in order to secure their goal of complete independence. He thinks it improb-able that Congress will attempt a rising, until the elections are completed next april, unless events force their hand, but he warns His Majesty&apos;s Government tobe prepared for a serious attempt by Congress next spring, and even possiblysooner, to subvert the present administration by force.Nehru&apos;s utterances since the Viceroy wrote his memorandum have madespecific reference to &quot; revolt&quot; and adopted a threatening tone in regard to&quot;settlement of differences between Congress and the Moslem League and betweenCongress and Great Britain. I do not take all Nehru&apos;s speeches at their face value, and recognise that much may be set down to the ebullience of electioneeringand to the fact that it is only a few months since he was released from detention.But I cannot take the Viceroy&apos;s warning lightly, particularly as I am told forthe first time that there are signs of a demoralising effect not only among thecivil services but also in the Indian Army.The following points arise for consideration from the Viceroy&apos;smemorannum : (a) The Viceroy assumes (para. 9) that there will be no question of theacceptance of a Congress ultimatum. I ask that I may be authorised by my colleagues to give him the assurance that his assumption is justified and that there will be no question of giving carte blanche to congress.(b) The Viceroy considers (para. 11) that there would be justification for moving against Congress now, but (para. 12) does not recommendimmediate action unless it is necessitated by disorders. I share his view and ask for agreement to it by my colleagues.(c) The Viceroy, however, considers that at a very early date a declaration should be made of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towardsthe growing threat of violence, covering the four heads suggested inhis paragraph 13. In my view the need for an immediate statement is not established, but I consider that a statement should be prepared[30880] b
now with a view to its use if necessary at an appropriate and agreedtime later on. Such a statement should not, in my view, be solelyof a-minatory character. It. should deal with the political situationgenerally, give an answer to some of the questions that are being asked, and also, quite firmly, handle the points raised by the Viceroy.It might be made in the House of Commons.(d) We must know what forces will be available at any moment for the suppression of disorder. I append (Annexure IV) a brief note ofthe military forces now available in the event of a situation developingbeyond the capacity of the police to handle. I.think that the questionof their adequacy should be enquired into further, particularly asregards the availability of more British troops.(e) Finally I consider the Viceroy is entitled to an answer to his request.for an assurance of our support for such action as may be necessary.J I do not see how we can refuse this assurance, but the Viceroy shouldbe asked to keep the Cabinet in close touch with the situation andwarned that action should not be taken except on the direct approvalof His Majesty&apos;s Government/P.-L.India Office, 11th November, 1945.
(Top.Secret.)        , ,,&apos; :..)--.,ANNEXURE I.Memorandum by the Viceroy enclosed with Letter dated6th November, 1945. . rWE are now faced in India with a situation of great difficulty and danger,in which I require support and guidance from His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. Since the session of the All-India Congress Committee (21st-23rd Septem-ber) the Congress leaders everywhere, but particularly Vallabhbhai Patel i in bombay and Nehru and Pant in the United Provinces, have been making state-ments and speeches which can only be intended to provoke or pave the way formass disorder. They began by taking the credit of the 1942 disturbances;asserting that the British could be turned out of India within a very short time;denying the possibility of a compromise with the Muslim League; glorifying theI.N.A.; and threatening the officials who took part in the suppression of the 1942disturbances with trial and punishment as &quot; war criminals.&quot; From these generalattempts to excite racial and communal hatred, they have now passed to a dis-closure of their programme, which is, briefly, to contest the elections, to serve an ultimatum on His Majesty&apos;s Government, and, in default of its acceptance, toorganise a mass movement on the 1942 lines but on a much larger scale.3.   The Con? body, would almost certainly deny, in spite of the speeches of members of the Working Committee, that violence is any part oftheir official creed. But either there is a secret policy which includes use of violence, or the more extreme leaders are out of control. Gandhi&apos;s influence isbelieved to be on the side of moderation, but he has said and done practicallynothing for weeks, and his friends are believed to be seriously worried about his health. Whether he will attempt later to control the extremist Congress leadersI do not know; but if, as I suspect, they are taking their line from the rank and file of the party, he may be unwilling or unable to do so.4. At any rate, there is nothing secret about the intentions of Nehru andPatel; and as they are, after Gandhi, by far the most influential of the congress leaders, the others are taking their line from them. In a recent speech at Bombay,Patel said that &apos;&apos; Congress was not going to sit quiet after the elections and waiton the convenience and pleasure of the British Government. The Congress would demand an immediate and final solution .... If such a solution was not forthcoming .... sure as day follows night there would follow anotherstruggle ....   When the time for action comes, and the time for action may come soon, we must be able to act as one man.....&quot;   Nehru said a day earlierthat &quot;revolution is inevitable.&quot;5. In order to make sure that there was no misunderstanding I saw Nehruon the 3rd November, and pointed out to him the danger of the course he andother leaders were advocating. He made it clear that he thought violenceinevitable, and shortly after our interview delivered an inflammatory speech ofthe usual kind. I believe that the Congress are counting on the I.N.A. as thespearhead of their revolt; they would suborn the Indian Army if they could, andthey hope that their threats will impair the loyalty and efficiency of the Police.They have been encouraged by events in French Indo-China and Indonesia, whichthey are watching carefully; and a good deal may depend upon what happensthere and in Syria and Palestine.6. The object of the rising the Congress leaders have in mind would bethe expulsion of the British. Whatever the leaders themselves might say publicly,there would be organised attacks on the railways and public buildings, treasurieswould be looted and records destroyed. In fact, Congressmen would attempt toparalyse the administration, as they did in 1942; they woul4 also attack andpossibly murder any officials, British and Indian, on whom they could lay their hands. In a recent speech Nehru has given special praise to the people of Ballia,a district in the United Provinces, in which the rioters managed to paralysethe administration for a few days in 1942; he named and threatened five british officials who restored order there.7.   It is in my judgment unlikely that the Congress leaders will attempttheir coup until all the Provincial elections are completed, unless events force[30880] b 2
their hand. I doubt if they are much interested in the elections as such; whatis more important to them is. the opportunity afforded by the elections to reviveand reorganise the Party, and they are already taking full advantage of this opportunity. The tone of the nationalist Press has perhaps never been worse,and there is no doubt about the growth of Hindu enthusiasm for the Congress.It is probable that there may be communal disorder on a large scale before theProvincial elections, and it is possible that in Provinces such as the U.P. andBihar, anti-Government disorders may begin before the Congress leaders intend.8. I must accordingly, with the utmost gravity, warn His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment to be prepared for a serious attempt by the Congress, probably next spring,but quite possibly earlier, to subvert by force the present administration in India.Half-measures will be of no use in dealing with a movement of this kind, andthe choice will lie between capitulating to Congress and accepting their demands-^whatever they may be-and using all our resources to suppress the movement.iy. 9. The main Congress demand would, I suppose, be the grant of immediateindependence to India under a Government selected by the Congress high command. This has been the aim of Congress policy for years, and it is clear-that nothing short of it would satisfy Nehru and Patel. I do not imagine thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government will wish to yield to force or threats of force; nor can we lightly divest ourselves of our obligations to the minorities. I assumetherefore, that there will be no question of the acceptance of a Congressultimatum.10. If this assumption is correct, we must be prepared to suppress themovement, and to suppress it this time with great thoroughness. I am aware of the extreme difficulty of this course; it would involve the use of a considerableforce of British troops; probably the declaration of martial law over parts of thecountry; the detention of a large number of persons without trial or trial by special courts; and the suppression for an indefinite period of the Congress Party.All this would be most unsatisfactory, but the alternative is to hand India overto a single party admittedly the strongest and best organised in the country,but consisting mainly of caste Hindus and experienced in nothing but agitation.If we handed over British India, it would be impossible for us to fulfil our obligations to the States, the rulers of which have loyally supported us.11. We should be justified in moving against the Congress now, on theinformation already available. The Party is not yet fully reorganised and its immediate suppression would be relatively easy. Moreover, immediate action would rally those Indians who have hitherto supported us, and would put heartinto the Services. The British members of the I.C.S. and I.P. are dispiritedand discontented; the Indian members of these services are uneasy about thefuture and under strong political and social pressure; while the Indian sub-ordinates on whom the administration so largely depends are naturally reluctant to make enemies of the future masters of India.[&quot; 12. But I dp not recommend immediate action, unless it is forced on: usbefore the elections by actual disorder. To abandon our programme now wouldbe to invite criticism all over the world, and to stimulate the general doubts about our good faith. I am afraid that we must wait for the present, and prepare to act quickly as soon as we are compelled to do so. The dangers ofinaction are grave, since the capacity of the administration in rural districts to stand up to serious disturbances is largely a matter of morale, and service moraleis now bad in many districts and is being steadily undermined.. 13. I am convinced that His Majesty&apos;s Government should at some very early&apos; date make it clear (i) that they are aware of the gravity of the Indiansituation;&apos; (ii) that they do not intend to permit the use of force by any political party and will suppress disturbances by every means; (iii) that they will supportagainst political attack officials who have done their duty; and (iv) that they willprovide me with the resources I require to keep the peace. A statement on theselines might bring some of the less hysterical Congressmen down to earth, andwould certainly put heart into the Services. It is in fact essential, in my view:and it is just possible that it might bring Congress to its senses and prevent theviolent movement which I apprehend.
ANNEXURE II.(125/43.)   &apos;My clear Pethick-Lawrence,1th November, 1945.Jawaharlal Nehru is in Delhi again to start the Congress election campaign and to assist in the defence of the members of the I.N.A., whose trial begins onthe 5th November. I asked him to come and see me, and had an hour with himon the morning of the 3rd November. I enclose a copy of the note I recordedimmediately after our talk. I began the conversation by telling him thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government, and I as Governor-General, were genuinely anxious for a settlement, but by constitutional methods and compromise, not violence.The intention was to endeavour to establish a &quot; political &quot; Executive Council atthe Centre as a short-term measure, and at the same time to try for a long-termsettlement. Our task would be made much more difficult both in the UnitedKingdom and in India if the elections ended in an atmosphere of racial andcommunal hatred and with a people excited to violence. I had been mostdisappointed at the time of Nehru&apos;s speeches and statements, and that of the speeches and statements made by many other Congress leaders. It seemed to methat Nehru&apos;s policy, if he meant what he said, was to be a violent mass movementagainst constituted authority; the victimisation of officials; and the refusal ofany compromise with the Muslim League. What Nehru chose to say was his business, but I thought it fair to let him know that it was the duty of HisMajesty&apos;s Government and myself to frustrate violence and the victimisation of officials. I thought that a settlement to be workable must have the support oracquiescence of considerable sections of all the major communities and parties,and that Nehru&apos;s attitude to the Muslim League would make a settlement far more difficult. I appreciated the reasons for his bitterness and resentment; Ihad said at Simla that there was much on all sides to forgive and forget, and Imeant it. Rut Nehru must remember that the British, and a good many Indians,too, had grounds for bitterness and resentment against the Congress. The Britishwere prepared to forget their grievances against the Congress, and Nehru andthe Congress should try to do likewise.With this additional explanation of the line I took, I think my note willgive you a clear picture of Nehru&apos;s attitude. I have no doubt that he is bent onserious trouble and that it will be very difficult indeed to divert him from hispurpose except by repressive action.The Right Hon. Lord Pethick-Lawrence.Note by the Viceroy on his Interview with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehruon 3rd November, 1945.1. I had an hour&apos;s conversation with Nehru. I emphasised that the present attitude of himself and other leaders was likely to make a settlement extremelydifficult; that no Government could continue to tolerate indefinitely incitement to violence or threats to its officials; and that the future of India must depend on some compromise between Hindu and Muslim.2. He replied to the last point first; and said-that Congress could make no terms whatever with the Muslim League under its present leadership and policy, that it was a reactionary body with entirely unacceptable ideas, withwhich there could be no settlement. He said it was Hitlerian in its leadership and policy, and tried to bully everyone. He made the somewhat surprising claim that the general relationship between Hindu and Muslim was better than it hadbeen for a long time and that the two communities had discovered that mobviolence did not pay. I mentioned the Bombay riots, and he claimed that theyhad proved his point since they did not spread to the rest of Bombay; I suggestedthat a casualty list of 40 killed and many injured was some evidence of communaltrouble, but he tried to claim it as merely the work of a&apos;few hooligans. Later on,when I argued that there must be some agreement between the main communitiesif we were to have a political settlement, he said that the Congress would neverapproach the Muslim League again, because of Jinnah&apos;s rudeness to their leaders, but if the Muslim League approached them they would be prepared todiscuss matters.Yours sincerely,(Signed)WAVELL.
3. On the issue of the victimisation of officials, he admitted having, namedfive officials of the Pallia district, and claimed that their actions had justified him in doing so. I pointed out that a general attempt to threaten police and officialswas going on in many parts of India, and was creating a deplorable atmosphere.His only answer was to say that if officials behaved as those in Ballia districthad done, he could not avoid preaching against them.4. He practically admitted that he was preaching violence, and that while he deplored violence, he did. not see how violence could be avoided if legitimateaims could not be attained otherwise. I warned him that the preaching of violence must eventually lead to violence, and that such violence would be likelyto lead to violent counter-measures. He talked in vague &quot;terms of the psychologyof the masses, the evils of foreign rule, the general uprising of the peoples of Asia,and so forth. I left him in no doubt that the Government were bound to take thenecessary measures to prevent violence.5. Towards the end he indicated, though he did not actually say so, that congress was likely to refuse to take office in the Provinces, except under a CentralGovernment which they controlled or approved. I said that it was the policy, ashe knew, of His Majesty&apos;s Government and myself to form a Government atthe Centre, but that the present attitude of political leaders was not going to makeit easy.6. He finished by asking what had been the result of my reference to theSupreme Commander of his request to be allowed to proceed to Java. I told him that the Supreme Commander had agreed with me that such a visit wasinadmissible in present conditions, and that I thought a reply to this effect hadalready been sent to him. He then asked what would be the attitude towards a request to visit Burma, for himself or for members of the defence committee ofthe LN.A., to collect evidence; I said that this would be a matter for the Govern-ment of Burma.7. Nehru&apos;s attitude was quiet and friendly throughout, and I cannot helpliking him. But he seems to me to have reached the state of mind of a fanatic,and is quite incapable of considering any views which do not coincide with hisown. I am afraid that his mood is dangerous to peace, and I think he realisesthis himself and regards a conflict as more or less inevitable.; v He did not mention the I.N.A., nor did I.W.ANNEXURE III.Extracts from Press Reports of the Speeches of Certain Congress Leaders.Pandit Nehru.On 27th October, 1945...,. &quot; These British and Indian officials who have wanted to write off the Con-gress and employed every means to crush it during the last three years will liveto see their wish entombed with an imperialism which is now taking its last fewbreaths.I challenge these officers to go to Ballia and see for themselves the futility oftheir attempts. The people there, despite terrible repression, walk with straightbacks and erect heads.,* -W- -AT- OJ. Ji. Jf.

This has got to stop now. Ican pardon shooting, I can pardon assaults, but I am unable to pardon atrocitiesperpetrated in cold blood.&quot;Rising to a fresh tempo of-indignation, Pandit Nehru said : &quot;A revolutionis inevitable. It is only a question of the time when it comes. Then we will be tested again.&quot;
On 2nd November, 1945., &quot; I am proud of the fact that the people of my Province put an end to british rule at places,&apos; although the duration of this period ranged from five to ten days and the British Army was used.to reconquer the areas that had been liberated.Our unarmed people are not to be blamed for their inability to stand againstmodern weapons.- They could not fight the British army of reconquest withlathis.&quot;Report by Renter from New Delhi on 12th November.Nehru demands end of British rule.New Delhi radio to-day quoted Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the CongressLeader, as demanding the &quot;complete liquidation of British rule in India.&quot;  &apos;Speaking at a public meeting in Bombay Nehru said : &apos;&quot; India must not wait for the next move of the Labour Government.&quot; She must depend on her own people and prepare herself for a massbattle for freedom, which may come sooner than people expect.&quot;&quot; Indianisation must mean not merely the appointment of - IndianGovernors in some Provinces, but the complete liquidation of British rule inIndia and the establishment of a people&apos;s Government in Delhi and theProvinces.&quot;Reported by The Times&apos; Correspondent on 12th November, 1945.Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, addressing an election meeting in Bombay, said it was the duty of a subject nation to &quot; revolt,&quot; and added that he used the word&quot;revolt&quot; after careful thought.. If a country was unprepared for revolution to free herself the nation was dead. Congress had never allowed the flag ofrevolution to be lowered.Pandit Pant.On 21st October.Addressing a mass meeting Pandit Pant, ex-Premier of the United Provinces,declared that the &apos;&apos; Quit India&apos;&apos; resolution of 1942 was a signal for rebellion inthe country and that signal was still their lode-star.The country was no longer in a mood to tolerate alien rule. Rebellion had now become the creed of the people and it would last until freedom was attained.Pandit Pant predicted that India would be completely free very soon. Thatfreedom would not be a gift from the Labour Government.On 22nd October.&apos;&apos; Remember, &apos; Quit India&apos; is our mantra. If the British Government doesnot withdraw gracefully, we will compel it to do so.&quot;On 31st October.&quot;Even if an Indian Government does such terrible things we will surelydestroy it and, therefore, we speak of destroying the foreign Government whichis responsible for the atrocities.&quot;On 3rd November.&quot; We are rebels and we shall remain rebels until we get what is our birth-right independence.   We do not want our freedom as a gift from the labour government.    We will win it in spite of them.    I challenge the British;Government and its allies to stop us if they can from achieving our objective.&quot;Sardar Patel.On 1st November.&apos;&apos; The Congress was not going to sit quiet after the elections and wait on the convenience and pleasure of the British Government. The Congress would demand an immediate and final solution of the Indian problem.If such a solution was not forthcoming, and if the British Government tried to put further obstacles in the way of India&apos;s progress, sure as day follows nightthere would be another struggle.&quot;
