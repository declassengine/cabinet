The members on their return would haveopportunity to make their views and impressions knownto Parliament, either in the course of a debate or in private meeting.(ii) That the Viceroy should be asked to inviteMr. Gandhi to see him as early as possible and before any disorders occurred, in the hope that Mr. Gandhi,who was pledged to a policy of non-violence, might be persuaded to exercise a moderating influence on theCongress leaders.(iii) That Mr. Nehru and Mr. Jinnah should beinvited po pay an early visit to&apos;London in order thatpersonal conversations with H.M. &apos;s Ministers may convince them of the reality of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;intentions and at the same time afford them opportunityto explain fully to His Majesty&apos;s Government the aims/of

-  of Congress and the Moslem League.(iv)   That the announcement of the proposal tosend out a Parliamentary delegation should be made ina weekhs time and be the occasion of a full restatementof the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towardsIndia,3.   I am pressing forward with the arrangements fora Parliamentary delegation, and in regard to (ii) and(iii) above I am communicating with the Viceroy.4c   On the specific suggestions made in my memorandum the Committee agreed as follows -(a) That I should assure the Viceroy that he was justified in his assumption that there would be noquestion of the acceptance of a Congress ultimatum,though I should remind him that Congress after theelections would in all probability be the majorityparty and it would not be possible to treat them as an irresponsible party claiming power.(b) That whatever justification there might befor taking immediate action against Congress&apos; orthe Congress leaders it would be disastrous for suchaction to be taken now unless it were necessitated by the outbreak of disorder.(c) That while an immediate declaration of His- Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s attitude towards the growing -threat of violence was not necessary, such adeclaration would have to be made sooner or laterand should be made as part of a more general state-ment of policy,   The occasion of the announcementregarding the Parliamentary delegation would offer a suitable opportunity for the purpose.   Thedeclaration should be framed in terms which wouldnot provoke an immediate outbreak of violence.(d) That the views of the Chiefs of Staff should beawaited in regard to the availability of troops foruse in the suppression of disorder if required..   (e)   That the Viceroy should be assured that in thelast resort he can rely on the support of HisMajesty[s Government for firm action subject to it being understood that the Cabinet would be-keptcontinuously in close touch with the situation andthat no action would be-taken against the majorparties or their leaders except with the express,approval of His Majesty&apos;s Government.

Discussion of the- steps that might be taken now toimprove the situation nas led us to the following conclusions(a)    -that arrangements should be -completed and announced,next week for the t?isit of a Parliamentary delegation to India-We hope that this delegation will help by its personal contactsto bridge the gap between political opinion in India and here,to demonstrate the sympathy of Parliament with Indianaspirations and to assure Indian opinion of the sincerity ofBritish intentions to help India forward with the leastavoidable delay on the path of&apos; self-government.-    The. arrangements are being dealt with in separate correspondence -You will appreciate &apos; that it is of great importance that the delegation should be known to have a free hand and to be.unrestricted in its movements and contacts by any officialcontrol .&apos;     - -fb)     that you should be asked to invite Gandni to see you in the hope that you may be able to persuade, him to co-operate with H..M-G-- in advancing toward a solution of the constitutional issues after the election and in the meanwhile to exercise arestraining influence on the Gongress leaders who are visiblytending towards a policy of violence-    I dp not know whether, infact his health would permit&apos;of the interview taking place\ ifIt does; you will no doubt consider 4t essential that? to avoidyou? own position being weakened? the interview should bearranged very soon while the situation is stall under control-In view of the great influence which Gandhi still retains I feelthat there would be positive advantages in such a move and I ;hope you will agree tc propose the -interview,(c)    that as a further stop in promoting personal- contactsan invitation should be given to Nehru and Jinnab. to visitLondon in&apos;the near future for the purpose of a general exchange/of \

of views with H*M-*.t&apos;s&apos;.S4ihisterfc-.   Whether- they &quot;would acceptis another matter; out if they did it is felt that theopportunity- of personal conversations with members of theCabinet- and of Parliament would go a- long way to remove the sense of distrust of fUlhG^s intentions and at the sametime give both leaders an opportunity to. expound their aims -in responsible quarters here5    I shall welcome your viewsor; this proposals    In particular should &quot;they be approachedprivately before- the invitation is publicly&apos; given-.    It ishoped that if the limited purpose of the visit&apos;is made clearit would be possible - without embarrassment to avoid acceptance&apos;&apos;of demands from leaders of other Parties or from the states for facilities for a similar visit to London, though if the .latter were proposed it could ba considered on its merits-;(d)    finally^ that advantage should be taken of the ,announcement of the visit of the Parliamentary delegation to &apos;emphasise in a restatement of H,,M.-.G,&apos;s policy the fixity oftheir determination to press on with the assembling of theconstitution making body as soon as the elections are over?obch a statement would also include a declaration of H-MJtsattitude to the possible threat of disorder in India for whicto.you pressed in your memorandum; I am now considering the linesof this statement and will consult you in regard to it as soonas- possibleiCopies to Under Secretaries of State.,-,
