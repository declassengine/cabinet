Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. .(45) 275.Qth November, 1945.CABINET.TOWN AND COUNTRY PLANNING LEGISLATION.&apos; Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.WE are committed in the King!s Speech to lay before Parliament this session&apos;-&apos; proposals to deal with the problems of compensation and betterment in relationto town and country planning, to improve the procedure for the acquisition ofland for public purposes, and otherwise to promote the best use of land in thenational interest.&quot;* The framing of the proposals needed to this end has now reached a stage where approval by the Cabinet is required, so that urgent drafting of the necessary legislation may proceed. Unless this can begin at once, there isgrave danger that the promise in the King&apos;s Speech will not be fulfilled.2. At their meeting on the 17th August, 1945,t the Lord Presidents Com-rnittee invited me to convene a small group of Ministers to guide and superviseinterdepartmental consideration of problems relating to the control of land use,&apos;This group was later formally constituted as a Sub-Committee of the lord president&apos;s Committee, consisting of the following Ministers, with myself in the chair:  .. . &apos;Chancellor of the Exchequer,President of the Board of Trade,Secretary of State for Scotland,Minister of Health,Minister of Agriculture and Pisheries,Minister of Town and Country Planning,and it was agreed that recommendations should be submitted by this Sub-Com-mittee directly to the Cabinet.i. After giving general guidance on major points,the Sub-Committee referred to an Official Sub-Committee the task of preparing a detailed scheme for legislation dealing with compensation and betterment and related planning problems, and the officials later submitted a detailed report, whichwas considered at a meeting of the Ministerial Sub-Committee on the31st October. $3. At this meeting, agreement was reached upon the attached proposedHeads of LegislationH (explanatory notes to which I also attach); and, except on two points to which I refer below, this agreement was unanimous. On thesetwo points which are both of major importance- the Chancellor of the Exchequerasked that his position should be reserved.4. The first point concerns the amount of the payment to be made as com-pensation for the statutory restriction of land to its existing use (Head II).The Ministerial Sub-Committee originally decided that compensation should ingeneral be limited to 50 per cent, of the &apos;&apos; market valuation &apos;&apos; of such development value as had accrued up to the 31st March, 1939, and the officials prepared their detailed proposals on this basis, with provision for a higher rate of compensation in certain clearly-defined cases of obvious hardship.  When these proposals came* Hansard, Commons, 15th August, 1945, Col. 56.f L.P. (45) 27th Meeting, Minute 5, Conclusion (1).i L.P. (45) 31st Meeting, Minute 2.g C.B. (45) 3rd Meeting.II Appendix &quot;A.&quot;b[30819]
before Ministers, it was pointed out that, assuming the figure of 50 per cent,had been selected because it was a reasonable overall average, then if (as was proposed) higher payment was to be made in certain cases and as much as100 per cent, in the case of &quot; dead-ripe &quot; land there was a strong case for reducing below 50 per cent, the payment to be made in respect of the remainingclaims. On these grounds it was therefore decided that the basic rate of com-pensation should be amended to 40 (see Head (4) (iii) of Appendix &quot;A&quot;).5. From this decision the Chancellor of the Exchequer dissents, and puts forward the following case : (a) No data are available for arriving by calculation at the percentage that should properly be paid : the 50 per cent, (or the 40 per cent.) is no more than a guess at the amoimt that should be paid after excluding the element of floating value. The element of floating value may wellbe larger than is here allowed for : in which case even a 40 per cent,payment is unduly high.(b) If a decision on the percentage to be paid could be deferred, data mightbe obtained (by valuation over a period of, say, the next five years)on which a more exact assessment of the element of floating value couldbe made, leading to a truer percentage, which might prove to be lower than 40 per cent. If this were so, the saving to the Exchequer might be substantial.(c) In any case, to announce now that compensation will be paid at 40 percent, might lead to charges of confiscation-especially as there is atpresent no substantial evidence to justify payment at that figure,such as might be available if the course at (b) above were adopted.6. While recognising the force of these arguments, the other members ofthe Sub-Committee nevertheless felt bound to reject them, for the following reasons : :(a) To make no mention of any specific rate of payment in the Bill would lead to a great and undesirable uncertainty in land transactions, andthere were also serious political objections.(b) The Chancellor&apos;s objections would be met, at least in part, by reducingthe payments from 50 per cent, to 40 per cent.7. The second point of disagreement relates to the time at which com-pensation should be paid, and the opposing points of view are set out at appendix &quot; B.&quot; The Sub-Committee agreed with the majority view of theOfficial Sub-Committee: namely, that payment should be made on a fixed date,to be fixed by the Treasury, being a date not later than three years after the Actbecame law. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, however, would prefer that pay-ment should be made only as and when development value may be frustrated byrefusal of permission to develop by the Planning Authority.8.   I therefore ask the Cabinet (1) To endorse the Heads of Legislation that were unanimously approvedby the Ministerial Sub-Committee;(2) To decide the two matters still at issue, set out at paragraphs 4 to above, viz. : (a) should the Bill fix the percentage at which compensation is to bepaid, and if so, should the figure, be 40 per cent. %(b) should compensation be payable at a fixed date or as and whenpermission to change the use of land is refused ?(3) To authorise the Minister of Town and Country Planning to proceedwith the preparation of a draft Bill in the light of such decisions asmay be reached on (1) and (2) above, and to submit the Bill for final approval in due course.H. M.-  i  Privy Council Office, S.W. 1,9th November, 1945.
APPENDIX &quot; A.&quot;COMPENSATION AND BETTERMENT.Proposed Heads of Legislation.I.- Statutory Restriction of Land to Existing Use.(4) All land, whether developed or undeveloped, to be subject to a statutoryrestriction to existing use, unless the consent of the Planning Authority is givenfor a change of use in any particular case; the definition of &quot; existing use &quot; toinclude the following:  (i) In the case of agricultural land, the definition of &quot; existing use&quot; tocover the broad range of agricultural uses (of which there are alreadyseveral statutory definitions) and the owner to be assumed to have aright to repair or rebuild existing agricultural buildings and to erectin addition such buildings as may be necessary for the farming of theland, subject to reasonable control of siting and design.(ii) In the case of land occupied by buildings, other than agriculturalbuildings, the owner to be assumed to have: (a) the right to keep the existing building, maintain it in repair, or make such minor structural alterations or improvements(including additions (e.g., the addition of a garage or furtherroom to a house) or extensions up to a maximum of 10 per cent,of the existing floor space) as may be necessary on grounds of domestic convenience or for the running of a business;(b) the right to rebuild to the same cubic capacity, height, floor space, &amp;c, and to use the new building for the same purpose asthe old.(iii) As regards the use of buildings, the owner to be deemed to be restricted to using the building or any substituted building for the same purposeor the same main purpose or class of purpose (e.g., any form of retailtrade would be regarded as one use).(iv) In the case of mixed users, such as a shop with dwelling accommoda-tion above, the owner to be assumed to be entitled to a reasonableadjustment of the proportions of the various users as may be necessary on grounds of business or convenience up to a maximum of 10 per cent,of the floor space.Notes.1. The effect of these provisions will be to take &quot; development rights &quot; outof private hands. They thus carry into effect the intention underlying the main commendation of the Uthwatt Committee, relating to development rights inundeveloped land outside town areas, but extend the conception to all land, sothat the whole country will be brought under a single scheme. This willprovide an effective basis for future planning operations.II.&apos; Compensation for the Imposition of the Statutory Restriction to existing use.(2) Compensation for the imposition of the statutory restriction to be pay-able only in cases in which development value (i.e., value over and above the valueof the land for its existing use) was inherent in the land on the 31st March, 1939,and only in respect of such development value.(3) Any owner of any interest in land to be entitled, within six months fromthe passing of the Bill (subject to extension of the period in certain cases), tosubmit a claim for compensation on the ground that, by reason of the imposition[30819] b 2
of the restriction to existing use, the value of his interest in that land, calculated as in (4) below, has been reduced by more than: (i)  20 per acre, or(ii) 10 per; cent, of the value of the interest as restricted to existing use,whichever is the greater.(3) Compensation to be payable as follows: (i) Where the owner can show that, before the war-time building controlcame into operation, he had either signed a contract for the erection of a building or submitted to the bye-law authority detailed construc-tional plans for development which had not been forbidden on planninggrounds, he shall be entitled to 100 per cent, of any development value which inhered in the land on the 31st March, 1939, calculated by taking the difference between-(a) the basic value i.e., the value of the land on a March 1939 basisof value, assuming it to have been restricted in perpetuity to itspresent existing use; and(b) its market value on a March 1939 basis.(ii) Where the owner can show that the interest in the land in respect ofwhich he is claiming compensation was purchased by him (or if heacquired by inheritance, by the person from whom he inherited) on or after the 1st April, 1929, and that the price which was then paidexceeded the 1939 basic value of the land, calculated as at (i) (a)above, he shall be entitled to claim the amount of the excess as additional compensation; except that (a) where changes have since taken place in the unit of land, or inthe nature and extent of the interest, or in the condition of theland (including buildings), &amp;c, the amount of the purchase price on which this calculation is based will be adjustedaccordingly;(b) in cases where the purchase took place at a price above the valueat (i) (b) above (whether the purchase was before or after that date) that value will, for the purpose of this calculation,be substituted for the purchase price.(iii) In all other cases, compensation to be at the rate of 40 per cent, of thedifference, if any, between the two valuations at (i) (a) and (b) ;owners falling within (ii) to be allowed to claim under this provisionif they deem it to be more favourable to them.(S) For the purpose of the valuation at (4) (i) (b), there should be excludedany element of value due to a possible use of the land for certain defined purposes,which may be classed broadly as anti-social (e.g., the use of land in certain areas for noxious trades, or the erection of buildings on land subject to flooding) on theground that such a use could reasonably have been disallowed without compen-sation under Section 19 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1932.(6) The unit of land for the purpose of each claim to be at the option of theowner; but where the unit is a part only of the owner&apos;s holding of land, deductionto be made from the valuation at (4)&apos; (i) (b) in respect of disturbance and anyinjurious affection to other land of the owner that would result from the develop-ment of that part of the land in respect of which compensation is claimed.(7) Provision to be made for an appeal to the Official Arbitrator should an owner and the Government valuer fail to agree on the valuations at (4) (i).(8) Compensation to be payable on a date to be fixed by the Treasury, being a date not later than [3] years after the date upon which the Act becomes law, orthe date for payment of value payments under the War Damage Act, whichever isthe later; and as from that date the owner to be entitled to interest upon anycompensation not so paid.(9) Where developers were in process of developing an area of land whenwar broke out, and the completion of the development was stopped owing to thewar, then, if the Minister is satisfied that there is no planning objection to thecompletion of the development (or some part of it), and is satisfied that the owner
will complete the development (or some part of it) as soon as the supply of labourand materials permit, he may direct that no compensation should be paid, andthat a licence to develop should be issued without payment of Betterment Charge.tfotes.2. The proposed basis of compensation for the loss of development rightsis as follows : (1) Where land was on the point of being developed when war broke out,the owner will receive compensation at the rate of 100 per cent, of the1939 development value, or, alternatively, willbe given a straight-forward permission to continue the development if there is no objection on planning grounds.(2) Where an owner bought land since March 1929 at a price which included a payment for development rights, he will be able to claim incompensation the amount of the purchase price attributable to thedevelopment rights, with the March 1939 value as a ceiling.(3) In all other cases, compensation will be at the rate of 40 per cent, of the1939 development value. Owners falling under (2) will have the option of claiming the 40 per cent, if it is more advantageous tothem.(4) In order to avoid a flood of trifling claims that would choke the adminis-tration, no claim will be admitted unless the development rights wereworth either  20 per acre or were more than 10 per cent, of theexisting-user value, whichever is the greater.being excessive, for depriving owners for the future of the right to reap increasedvalues on development or redevelopment of their land. The IJthwatt Committeeestimated that if compensation were paid on the basis of 100 per cent, of the&quot; market value &quot; of each separately owned parcel of land, owners as a class would receive between two and three times as much as the total development rights as a -whole were in fact worth. The global method of compensation recommended bythe Uthwatt Committee (following the precedent of the Coal Act, 1938, whichnationalised coal royalties) would be extremely difficult to apply to developmentvalues in land and would lead to hardship and glaring anomalies. Moreover,many years would be needed to collect the information necessary for an accuratecalculation of the global sum and, meanwhile, the effect of the legislation mightbe held up. The above provisions will give broadly the same amount ofcompensation to owners but will, it is believed, avoid major hardship.4. No estimate can be made of the total amount of compensation involved.It will undoubtedly be heavy, but after a few years the income from bettermentought to be sufficient to meet a substantial part, at any rate, of the interest charges.5. It is proposed that compensation should be payable at a date to be fixed by the Treasury. The Bill would provide that this date should not be earlier thanthe date for making value payments under the War Damage Acts but, subject tothat, would be not later than three years from the passing of the Act. TheChancellor of the Exchequer dissents from this last proposal, however, and desires .that payment should only be made as and when an owner is refused permission todevelop. The respective arguments for &quot; as and when &quot; payment and for &quot; fixed date &quot; payment (the majority view) are set out in Appendix B.6. If the proposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for &quot; as and when&quot;payment of compensation is accepted, the compensation proposals set out above will need reviewing. In particular, a detailed scheme will also need to be drawnup for recording the compensation, apportioning it on any change of unit, and distributing it when it falls due for payment.(A) The Preparation of Plans.(10) (a) Local Planning Authorities (combined where necessary as under present law) to be required within 3 years from the passing of the Act to prepare&quot; Outline Plans &quot; showing their proposals for the future planning of their areas.3.The aim of thesethat is fair, withoutIII. Planning Requirements.
(b) These plans to be submitted to the Minister for approval after being made public and being the subject, where necessary, of a public enquiry.(c) The Minister to have power to give directions as to the matters to beincluded in the Outline Plan^ either on specific points or generally on theprinciples which should govern its preparation and its contents.(d) Local Planning Authorities to be required to prepare more detailed plans of particular parts of their area as and when a more intensive development oyredevelopment of any part is to be taken in hand; such plans also to be subject tothe approval of the Minister, who will have power to issue directions regardingthe &quot; planning standards &quot; to which development should conform.(B) The Execution of Plans.(I) The Granting of Consents for Change of Use.(11) Provisions are required (a) to enable permission for a different use to be granted in all appropriate cases;(b) to enable the Minister to give a &quot;block&quot; consent to certain classes ofdevelopment by means of a Ministerial Order corresponding very closely to the General Interim Development Order made under theexisting Planning Acts (S.R. &amp; O. 349/45).(12) Subject as above, the power to give or refuse consent to rest primarily with the appropriate Local Planning Authority, but the Minister will be given power to revoke or modify consents; to require particular applications or applica-tions of a particular class to be referred to him for decision; and to direct local planning Authorities to notify him of particular applications or of particularclasses of applications received, and, where necessary, of the decisions given on them.(II) The Control of Existing Use.(13) The Local Planning Authority to be empowered to exercise controlwithin the range of existing use on the lines already provided in the Town and country Planning Act, 1932.(14) In defined circumstances, the owner to be entitled to compensation orto be given a right to require the Local Authority to buy his property if theexercise of their powers renders it sterile.(Ill) Compulsory Purchase of Land.Powers.(IS) Powers to be provided for compulsory purchase of land, with the con-sent of the Minister of Town and Country Planning, for the following purposes: (a) to enable any feature of an approved Outline Plan or Development plan to be carried out;(b) to ensure that land is made available for any development that is inaccordance with an approved plan;(c) during the period prior to the settlement of the Outline Plan, for any purpose which, in the opinion of the Minister, is immediately necessaryin the public interest, having regard to the planning requirements ofthe area.Price.(16) The purchase price on compulsory acquisition to be assessed on theassumption that the land was subject, at the time of purchase, to a perpetualrestriction to existing use, and while Part II of the Town and Country planning act, 1944, remains in operation to be related to a 1939 standard of values, withsuch supplementary payments as that Act provides.
(IY) Power of Local Planning Authorities to carry out Development.(17) Local Planning Authorities to be given a general power of development,with the consent of the Minister, for carrying out or securing the object of an7.   The object of legislation on the subject of compensation and bettermentis to enable the use of the land resources of the country to be guided and directedI    on sound planning principles.   The planning machinery provided by existingI   legislation is lengthy, cumbersome and rigid, and not readily adaptable to a pro-I    cess of positive planning.  The above proposals provide for an improved procedureIfor the preparation and execution of plans, and for their progressive modificationto meet changing circumstances. They include, in particular, extended powersof compulsory purchase of land to enable the plans to be carried out and a discretionary power to the Minister to permit Local Authorities to carry outdevelopment in appropriate cases.(18) In all cases-where planning permission is given for any change in theuse of any land or buildings outside the definition of existing use in paragraph (1)and the permission so given raises the value of the land above its value for existing use, the person carrying out that change to be required to obtain fromthe Land Commission a licence to proceed with the development for which permis-sion has been- granted and to pay a Betterment Charge in respect of such increasein value as results from the permission.(19) The licence only to be issued to a person who is himself going to carryout the development, who will be required to show that he has a sufficient legalinterest in the land to enable him to develop.(20) Transfer of the licence to another person to be permitted only with theapproval of the Land Commission, but such approval not to be unreasonably(21) Applicant to have a right of appeal to the Minister against the Better-ment Charge only in cases where land has already been purchased in anticipation of future requirements e.g., for a proposed factory extension.(22) Penalties to be provided for developing without obtaining a licence.(23) The Land Commission to be given power to accept payment of the betterment Charge by instalments, or on the basis of an annual charge, or by such other methods as appear to them to be appropriate in any particular case.8. The State having purchased all rights of development or redevelopment(which will be vested in a Land Commission), any person who desires to developparticular land and has planning permission to do so, will be required to obtain a licence from the Land Commission and pay (or give security for) the BettermentCharge. Put shortly, he will have to buy from the State the right to develop.In practice, the amount will be related, so far as possible, to the value of the landfor the purpose to which the developer intends to use it; it will be, in effect, thevalue of the licence to the applicant and will be fixed by negotiation in much thesame way as the rent or premium on a lease is fixed in ordinary transactions.The Land Commission will thus be left with a wide discretion, but they will besubject to direction by the Minister of Town and Country Planning, who willbe required to consult the Treasury and will be answerable to Parliament. Itwill be a duty of the Land Commission to see that necessary development is not held up, and in fixing the Betterment Charge, therefore, they will have to takeparticular care to see that it is not fixed so high that it undermines the profit-ability of the proposed enterprise and destroys the incentive to develop.9. In order that the Land Commission should have data available for fixing the appropriate Betterment Charge, arrangements will be made, if necessary, for&quot;open-market sales &quot; from time to time.approved plan.IY.

10. Opposition may be expected in Parliament to the proposal to leave tothe Land Commission a complete discretion as to the charge to be imposed. close examination of the position, however, has shown that it is neither practicable nordesirable to provide a rigid statutory formula for the calculation of the Better-ment Charge. Nor is it thought that there should he any general right of appeal,except in the special case of a person who has already bought land specifically forthe extension of an existing use e.g., a factory extension. In such a case, pro-vision is made for an appeal to the Minister.Y. Application to Minerals.(24) The universal restriction to existing use to be drafted so as to prohibit the working of surface or underground minerals otherwise than with planningconsent (to which any necessary conditions may be attached) and the paymentof a Betterment Charge where appropriate.(25) &quot;Current workings &quot; to be given a statutory right to continue for alimited period or until stopped by ad hoc notice. Such workings to be dennedso as to include land already being worked with such adjoining land as may be appropriate.Notes.11. The proper allocation of land for mineral working and the imposition,in appropriate cases, of conditions for &quot; after-treatment,&quot; of the land are animportant aspect of planning. This provision will give the State the right tocontrol future mineral working in the same way that the above provisions will secure the right to control other forms of future development. The exemption of&quot; current workings &quot; is necessary in order to. avoid any hold-up in production onthe introduction of the new system.
APPENDIX &quot; B.&quot;Time for Payment of Compensation.The following extract from the First Report of the Official Sub-Committeeon Compensation and. Betterment* sets out the respective arguments for &quot; as andwhen&quot; payment and &quot;fixed date&quot; payment, referred to in paragraph 5 of the notes in Appendix &quot; A &quot; : Time for Payment.36. At the Meeting of Ministers on the 28th August, 1945,t it was recognised that, as the valuation process would take several years, immediatepayment of compensation was out of the question; and Ministers adopted the.only alternative proposal then before them, namely, that payment should onlybe made if and when application for permission to develop is refused. Thiswas the proposal in the White Paperl issued by the Coalition Government. Inthe course of preparing a detailed scheme, however, the majority of theCommittee have come to the conclusion that to make the payment of compensationdependent upon the refusal of planning permission will lead to serious adminis-trative difficulties without any corresponding financial advantage, and may evenendanger the whole policy of planning. We recommend, therefore, the Treasurydissenting, that all compensation in respect of development rights accrued up tothe 31st March, 1939, should be paid off on a fixed date, whether or not the owner of the land has applied for permission to develop.The Treasury view.37. The Treasury representative is of opinion that the previous decision should remain i.e., that compensation should be paid only when permission todevelop is refused to an owner who can show that he is able and willing to develop,and that there is a demand for such development. The considerations putforward in support of this view are as follows : 1(a) The amount of compensation cannot be estimated in advance.  Therefore,under the proposal for a &apos;&apos; fixed date &apos;&apos; payment, the Governmentwould be committed to the payment, over a relatively short period, of an amount of compensation of unpredictable, butcertainly of very considerable, magnitude. As regards undevelopedland, intelligent guesses have been made. As regards developed land,no one has even hazarded an opinion of what amount is involved.(b) If the compensation claim is met in full at the outset, irrespective of whether development would actually be refused, it would be almost impossible to establish any control over the relation of the com-pensation charge to the produce of the betterment charge. TheGovernment must retain the power, if circumstances so necessitate,of controlling the giving or withholding of planning consents in thelight of the financial working out of the compensation and bettermentscheme.(c) The payment of compensation involves the issue of either cash ornegotiable securities, carrying an annual burden of interest charges,against something which is not a revenue-earning asset at the momentbut is merely the present value of a future earning capacity. Theissue of compensation should therefore be as near in time as possibleto the realisation somewhere else of the development, the refusal ofwhich in a particular place is the occasion for the payment ofcompensation.(d) So far as the recipients of compensation are disposed to spend money which has come to them in advance of expectation, the scheme would add to the inflationary pressure likely to be experienced in the earlyreconstruction period.(e) The Treasury appreciate that postponement of compensation has a bearing on the percentage of development value as at 1939 which canbe regarded as true value.  Therefore, if a satisfactory basis is devised* C.B. (45) 6.f CB. (45) 1st Meeting, Minute 5.i White Paper on the Control of Land Use (Cmd. 6537), paragraph 34.[30819] c
for restricting compensation, in the main, to occasions when develop-ment would have taken place but for planning refusal, it wouldbecome justifiable to pay a higher percentage than the 50 per cent,at present proposed.The majority view. )38. The following are the arguments on which the view of the majorityr-namely, that all compensation should be paid on a fixed date-is based :  (a) Such  payment i.e.,  payment  irrespective  of  any  application  for planning consent -must in any case be made, as was recognised inthe White Paper,* wherever any area of land is zoned againstdevelopment, e.g., as agricultural land or as a green belt. But, in fact,green belts for London and for three or four other great cities willaccount for a considerable proportion of the undeveloped land inrespect of which compensation is payable.(b) As regards the remainder, the proposal for &apos;&apos; as and when &apos;&apos; payment will not in practice spread out the payment of compensation to any material extent. If payment of compensation is made dependent ona planning refusal, then the very great majority of those who claim that there was development value in their land at the 31st March, 1939,will forthwith apply for planning permission to develop, so that, onrefusal, compensation would be payable. (N.B. We are satisfiedthat in practically all such cases the check suggested in paragraph 37above, namely, that the owner should be required to show that he isable and willing to develop and that there is a demand for such development, could be overcome without difficulty; nor are we ableto suggest any more effective check.)(c) Furthermore, and this, in our view, is of great importance, claims put up in this form would inevitably choke the administrative machine.Under the proposal for &quot;fixed date &quot; payment, claims for compensa-tion would be based solely on the existence of development value atthe 31st March, 1939, would go direct to the Land Commission, andif, owing to their number, there were some delay in payment, no greatharm would result. Under the &quot;as and when&quot; proposal, on theother hand, all such claims, although in fact claims for compensation,would take the form of applications for planning permission, andwould go to the Planning Authority, who would have to consider themseriously from the planning point of view. The result would be thatgenuine applications for permission to develop would be swampedby a mass of quasi-bogus applications from owners who have no desireto develop and no expectation of obtaining permission to do so : andthe whole machinery of development would be most seriously clogged.id) We have left to the last the proposition which in fact lies at the root ofthe Treasury arguments at (a), (b) and (c) in paragraph 37 above namely, that the administrative machinery of planning must be sodesigned that if, at any future period, it should be found that theoutgoings of compensation are getting out of balance with theincomings of betterment, there can be such a material increase in thenumber of grants of permissions to develop carrying bettermentcharge as to bring the two sides of the account back into step. Weare, on the one hand, strongly of opinion that extravagantplanning planning without regard to its long-range financial results -is bad planning; but we submit that sufficient safeguards against this are provided by the complete power embodied in theActs of 1943 and 1944 to the Minister to overrule the decisions ofLocal Planning Authorities, and in the provisions of Section 7 ofthe Act of 1944 which, in effect, require the consent of the treasury to be given to plans for the redevelopment of &quot; blitzed &quot; areas andthe development of satellite towns. But to say, as the Treasuryargument does in effect say, that decisions and plans are to be governed by their short-range financial out-turn, and that becausedecisions in the first period of three or four years have involved morecompensation that the betterment they have produced, therefore thedecisions in the next period must be governed by quite different* White Paper on Control of Land Use (Cmd. 6537), paragraph 34.
considerations, seems to us to reintroduce into planning the preciseevil which rendered the Act of 1932 largely ineffective and against which the whole of the Uthwatt proposals were directed. In rejectinga proposal on somewhat similar lines, the Uthwatt Committeeobserved that: &apos;&apos; We are satisfied that it would be destructive of anytrue policy or programme of national planning. &quot;*39. To sum up, therefore, the view of the Committee, the Treasurydissenting, is that if planning is to be soundly administered on the basis of a long-term programme for the proper use of our land resources, the payment ofcompensation to landowners for development values must be treated as a separatetransaction and divorced from planning operations. To effect such adivorce was the main object of the Uthwatt Committee. If it is noteffected, the grant or refusal of planning permission must inevitably beswayed by the consideration whether or not refusal will entail compensation;and the attempt to cure the main defect of the Act of 1932 is in effectabandoned. Moreover, since, in the view of the majority, to make compensa-tion dependent on the refusal of planning permission would not result inany material reduction in the total disbursements in the early years .afterpayments become general, it has little or no financial attraction. For the same reason, since in any case the payment of compensation must, they submit, be postponed for at least two years, it could have little effect upon coming inflationary pressure; nor would it help in those early years in balancing betterment income and compensation expenditure, even if there is any real danger that, after acomparatively short period betterment income will not at any rate suffice to meetloan charges. They consider that the financial dangers can only be reduced, short of abandoning planning as a policy, by revising the basis of compensation or bypostponing the date on which payments begin. They do not recommend theformer, but to meet the latter they propose above that in general no compensation should be paid for at least three years after the passing of the Bill; if need be themoratorium could be extended and payment could also if necessary be spreadover a number of years.* Final Report of Expert Committee on Compensation and Betterment, paragraph 132.
