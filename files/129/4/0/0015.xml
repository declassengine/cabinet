Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I should be grateful if the Cabinet would give the necessary instructionsto ensure that at least 3-4,000 Italian prisoners of war are repatriated this month or before the middle of next.2. At their meeting on the 18th September, 1945, the Cabinet authorised meto make a communication to the Italian Government Representative in regard tothe beginning of repatriation. In this communication, which was duly made onthe 28th September in the form approved by the Cabinet, it was stated thatrepatriation would begin as soon as this year&apos;s harvest was completed and as soonthereafter as transport was available. It was further stated that every effort would be made to ensure that repatriation was started before the end of this year.3. So far as I can ascertain from the War Office, existing priorities will only permit of a &quot; trickle &apos;&apos; of Italian prisoners of war during the months ofDecember to March, after which there should be some improvement. For thetime being, no details are available. I cannot regard this as satisfactory. Itis our policy to build up Italy and to give encouragement to the Government inits present somewhat precarious situation. I consider that as an immediateearnest of our intention at least 3-4,000 Italian prisoners of war should be senthome at an early date, even if this means revising existing priorities. In view7of the condition, that this year&apos;s harvest should first be completed, I considerthat this draft should be moved this month or at the latest in the first half of next. Thereafter a regular flow should be kept up. I attach more importanceto regularity than to numbers.Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1945.SECRET.CP.
