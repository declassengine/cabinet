Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.-SECEET.Copy No.c.p.. (45) 274.3th November, 1945.CABINET.PROGRESS REPORT ON HOUSING, OCTOBER 1945.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.AS Chairman of the Housing Committee, I have been instructed in the PrimeMinisters note of the 20th September (CP. (45) 184) to submit a monthly progress report to the Cabinet showing the housing programme and the progress made.T propose to make my first report on the position as at the end of October showingprogress made since the end of July (the nearest convenient date to our takingoffice). Except where otherwise stated, figures relate to England and Wales,Scottish figures being shown separately in brackets.Programme.2. It has been agreed by the Cabinet that no programme or target for thenumber of houses to be provided within a stated time should be published, but mycolleagues and I have agreed to adopt for the purpose of phasing productionsubstantially the same programme as was published by the Coalition Govern-ment in the White Paper on Housing issued in March 1945, to which we proposeto add an allowance for. permanent prefabricated houses. On this basis we are planning for the following numbers of different types of houses built or under construction in Great Britain by the end of June 1947 Permanent traditional houses        ...      ...      ...      300,000Temporary prefabricated houses     ...      ...       ...       165,000Prefabricated or untraditional permanent houses...       100,000Progress.3. Statistical Tables &quot;showing progress in both temporary and permanenthousing schemes between the end of July and end of October are annexed.(Table A.)Permanent Traditional Houses (Local Authorities&apos; schemes).4. The average price for the 3-bedroom houses included in tenders so farapproved during 1945 is 20s. lid. (20s. hd.) a sq. ft. This compares with 9s. 1\d.(10s. 1\d.) in 1938-39, but the new houses are of a higher standard of accommo-dation and equipment. The estimated cost of the new improved house on -thebasis of prices in 1938-39 is 10s. %\d. (11s.) sq. ft.It has been necessary for me to reject a number of tenders which appearto me too high. This course seems to me essential in order to obtain a propercontrol over prices at the outset. The number of houses for which tenders have so far been rejected is 1,375 (82) as compared with 12,595 (9,475) accepted.&apos; Rural Housing.5. A short statistical Table indicating progress made with permanenthousing schemes in rural districts is annexed (Table B).   Having regard to the[30843] b
importance of making a start in each area it may be noted that 14 per cent, ofthe Rural District Councils, as compared with nearly 12 per cent, of the non-County Borough Councils and Urban District Councils, have tenders approved.I have referred the question of reconditioning rural cottages to the rural housing Sub-Committee of my Central Housing Advisory Committee with termsof reference &quot; to advise generally on the reconditioning of rural cottages, withspecial reference to the supply of labour available without diversion from new building and to consider what improvements could be made in the Housing (RuralWorkers) Acts.&quot;&quot; Prefabricated &quot; Permanent Houses.- 6. Further investigations are being made by the Ministry of Supply intothe production of the pressed steel house with a view to placing an order for50,000 (to be built in pairs) and an order has been placed for 1,500 Weir Steelhouses- in Scotland, where the erection of 1,500 Atholl houses has also been authorised.Particulars of seven other types of alternative construction have been com-municated to local authorities, comprising four steel-framed systems and threeconcrete systems. The authorities have been asked how many houses of the 1various steel or steel-framed types they wish to order on the assumption that Ithe price will be approximately the same as for a permanent traditional house, Iand arrangements for securing production will be considered when the replies Io&apos;f the authorities are known. In the case of the concrete types, it has been I suggested to the authorities that they should get in direct touch with the Iproducers.Deliveries have begun of the timber houses being imported from Sweden.Exhibition houses are being erected in Scotland and England.Private House Building.7. The number of licences issued by local authorities in Great Britain forthe erection of houses by private builders, of which copies had reached the Ministryof Works by the end of September, was 8,658 (24). This figure includesapproximately 2 s0s war-destroyed houses to be rebuilt. \Temporary Houses.8. Apart from the progress shown in the statistical statement (Table A),there has been no change in the position as reported in the White Paper on thetemporary housing programme (Cmd. 6686).Requisitioning.9. The number of houses held on requisition on behalf of local authorities for use as dwellings for all purposes, e.g., the homeless, war workers or theinadequately housed, is 90,000 (1,288). The number of small houses still underrequisition in Great Britain by the Services and Government Departments (otherthan those held by the Health Departments on behalf of local authorities) is roughly 14,000, but all Departments have now prepared programmes for the releaseof the houses held; and the Ministry of Works is acting as co-coordinator of theprocess.Emergency Scheme for Sharing Houses.10. Defence Regulations have been prepared (a) Waiving Restrictive Coye-nants and the operation of the Rent Restrictions Acts where owners respond tothe Government appeal to take in lodgers and (b) to prevent change of use of premises from residential to non-residential. The latter has been approved bythe Legislation Committee and laid, and the former is coming before them onthe 6th November.Building Materials.11. The Minister of Works has prepared an analysis of the materials and components required in a house, indicating the present cost as compared with pre-war costs.   He is preparing a further statement amplifying this analysis
3 -     82and setting out the methods hitherto adopted to control costs and the considera-tions which must govern future action in this matter. The Ministers of Supplyand of Works are considering what steps can be taken to increase the productionof the items of which there is a deficiency.Labour.12. The amount of labour now employed on housing schemes as corn-pared with before the war is shown in the table annexed (Table C). this table gives the latest complete figures available. It is estimated that at the endof October the number of men engaged on the erection of permanent houses wasabout 3,900 (4,000), unfilled vacancies at that date being 3,539 (165). In additionto British labour, about 22,000 German prisoners of war are at work in GreatBritain on site development.Release of local authorities&apos; staff.13. The number of local government officers so far released for housing work from the Services and Government Departments is 1,463 (223) and 275 (42)respectively. 712 (86) applications are at present before the Services (it is under-stood that in the majority of these cases it has already been decided to offer theapplicant release), and 186 (2) applications are under consideration by Govern-ment Departments; 103 (7) have been rejected by the Services and 1 (21) by-Government Departments.Legislation.14. The Building Materials and Housing Bill is in preparation. this bill includes provisions for :  (a) Financing the purchase and sale of building materials and components and the erection of houses by the Ministry of Works.(b) Controlling the selling price of new houses built under licence.(c) Increasing the maximum value of houses for the purchase of -whichadvances may be made by the local authority under the SmallDwellings Acquisition Acts or Housing Act, 1936.(d) Increasing the financial provision in the Housing (Temporary Accom-modation) Act of 1944 for the manufacture of temporary houses.The Acquisition of Land Bill providing a speedier procedure for obtainingpossession of land for housing should be ready for the Legislation Committee bythe end of November.Subsidies.15. Agreement has been reached with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that future subsidies should be based on an average standard rent to be paid by thetenant of 10s. a week plus rates. The form of the subsidies is now beingconsidered in consultation with the Treasury and as soon as this point has been settled discussions with local authorities will begin.A.
