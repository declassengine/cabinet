THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted, for- we Cabinet. ; - October 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 263.mh October, 1945.Copy No.     74CABINET.ADMISSION TO THE UNITED KINGDOM OF DISTRESSED persons whose RELATIVES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE ABLE and willing TO MAINTAIN THEM. .Memorandum by the Home Secretary.&apos;V:T am being pressed to admit to this country survivors of Germanconcentration camps who have relatives here able and willing to look after thermand also other distressed persons who have been in hiding from the Gestapo orfor Various reasons are especially in need of care. .H: 2. It would not, I think, be right to contemplate any large-scale additionto our foreign population at the present time, but inability to grant all theserequests is not a reason for refusing to grant any of them, if some scheme can.be devised for differentiating in favour of limited classes of persons.Subject to the consideration of the views of my colleagues, I propose thefollowing scheme: Where there are compassionate grounds and the relative inthis1 country is able and willing to provide accommodation and maintenance,persons should be admitted who fall into the following limited classes:- ..   a.\(a) The wife and minor or dependant children of a man in this country:. (b) The husband of a wife who is in the United Kingdom if the husband isincapacitated, infirm or elderly and unable to support his wife and. ;&apos;, children (if any) abroad.   Categories based on other degrees ,of relationship than membership of the limited family unit (husband,wife and minor or dependant children) present great difficulties ifwe are to avoid opening the door too widely, and I propose as regards other admissions to differentiate in favour of the aged who have special need of filial care and of the young who have special need of a guardian&apos;s care, and to admit persons falling into the following catergories : &apos;(c) Mother or grandmother, if widowed and in need of filial care; fatheror grandfather if such men are in special need of care owing to age or infirmity. If both the man and wife are living together abroadit should not be the general practice to admit such couples, butexceptions may be made if because of age or infirmity or other specialcircumstances they are unable to look after and support one another.(d) Males under 18 and females under 21 [with their children (if any) whohave no-one to look after them except some relative in this country who is able and willing to take them into his household. For suchyoung persons there is, I suggest, a special case for admission without regard to the degree of consanguinity.Some limited schemes for the provision by voluntary organisations of special hostels for children and young persons have already been authorised, but any large-scale extension of schemes of this kind would. involve unjustifiable demands on available housing accommodation,and my proposal as regards youths under 18 and girls or women under21 applies only to those whose relatives in this country can provide them with accommodation.[30782]
3. It is impossible to give an estimated figure 6f the number of personswho would be admitted under this limited scheme. The applications coming tomy Department during Veeeht/weeks ^ftr&apos; the -admissibh of&apos; foreign relatives havebeen extremely numerous. I am clear-although on humanitarian -grounds Ireach the conclusion with the utmost regret that any policy of granting theseapplications freely ought not to be contemplated. The large number of applica-tidns already received, despite the fact that hitherto most such applicationshave been refused, indicates that as soon as any relaxation is made, the flood of applications would be beyond any figure which could be contemplated as the limit for admissions to this country in present circumstances. If, however, admissionsare limited to prescribed categories on the lines indicated above, I do not thinkthat the total number would be inordinate.4. The scheme proposed will necessarily involve refusals in many distressingcases where strong appeals can be made on compassionate grounds, but no schemelimiting the number of admissions to this country is administratively workableunless clearly-defined categories are prescribed and publicly announced, and theprinciple is accepted that other applications must be refused. .;!:nyr/5. As a general rule, the admission of these additional foreigners to thiscountry will involve their stopping here for substantial or indefinite periods. Insome cases it is possible to admit foreign relatives on short visits to this countryfor rest and recuperation, but as regards most of these people who are in distressedcircumstances in Europe, insistence on their departure after a visit and onseparation from the family to whom they have been reunited, might involvegreater hardship than refusal to admit them at all. Those whose relatives already in this country have been admitted on a temporary basis should be admitted onthe Same basis and be expected to leave the United Kingdom when the alienwho is already here departs. Some, however, of the people in this country who wish to invite foreign relatives are British subjects; some are aliens established in residence here; and in such cases many of the newcomers, although they -willusually be admitted on a temporary basis in the first instance, will probably becomepermanent additions to our population, subject, of course,&apos; to good behaviour:&apos;&apos; &quot; ;&apos;&quot;&apos; 67 There has been consultation at the official level with the various departments concerned with this problem, and these consultations have confirmed the view that for numerous reasons the addition of foreigners to our populationat the present time must be closely limited. In addition to such considerations asthe shortage of housing and of clothing and supplies of various sorts, there is theconsideration that at the time when demobilisation is in process the admission ofa large number of foreigners would create apprehension as to competition in thelabour market. It is proposed to impose generally on persons admitted under-thescheme outlined above a condition that the newcomer does not take employment without the consent of the Ministry of Labour and National Service.: 7. I suggest that the question should be considered of informing theGovernment of the United States of the policy which we propose to adopt and asking that Government to consider whether the United States can providecorresponding measures of relief for distressed persons on the Continent whoserelatives in the United States are prepared to give them hospitality.   .  .8. Questions about the admission to the United Kingdom of distressedpersons whose relatives here want to receive them have been asked in the Houseof Commons, and I propose, if the Cabinet agree, to make a statement at an earlydate about the scheme outlined above.- &apos; J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,30th October, 1945.
