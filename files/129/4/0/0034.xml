Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945. -       107SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 284.11th November, 1945.CABINET.TOURIST TRAFFIC TO GREAT BRITAIN FROM THE UNITEDSTATES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.REPRESENTATIONS have been made to me regarding the possibility of bringing Americans to this country next summer for holiday purposes. It wouldbe an advantage financially if as many as possible could be induced to come. Themain obstacle, however, will be accommodation, and the only way to overcome itis by using Government hostels, universities and public schools, especiallyuniversities which are residential and whose vacation is longer than that of thepublic school.2. If this idea could be developed, a chain of accommodation in interestingcentres could be arranged up and down the country. The people for whom weshould cater would be the student class, and the middle and lower-income classes.I understand that what is needed in order to get it going is approval of theprinciple by the Cabinet, and an indication that we should regard this as per-forming a useful national service. That would be sufficient to induce the head-masters and university authorities to co-operate and, in addition, it would be a direction to Government Departments such as the Ministry of Labour and theMinistry of Works to arrange to reserve certain hostel accommodation. Bodieslike the Workers&apos; Travel Association and Cook&apos;s and others are very anxious toco-operate. From a Foreign Office point of view, I am anxious to get as manyvisitors from the United States to this country as I possibly can, and especially toarrange for them to associate with the ordinary people of the country, and the universities and student classes. From the commercial point of view^, it would bean advantage to us if this kind of tourist travel was developed immediately.3. I ask for Cabinet approval. I have discussed it with the President of theBoard of Trade, and he agrees and would be willing for his parliamentary secretary to undertake the necessary organisation.E. B.Foreign Office, 11th November, 1945.13026   [30890]
