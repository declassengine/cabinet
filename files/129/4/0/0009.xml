THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1945.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. St is issued for the personal use of .......................................TOP SECRET Copy No.   65CP. (45) 259.20th October, 1945.CABINET.SITE OT UNITED NATIONS OEGANISATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE change in the situation since OP. (45) 17! was issued makes it desirableto review the position on a subject of the greatest importance to United kingdom interests. Before a final decision is made it is necessary to make clear how thepresent position arose, and the consequences of the establishment of the seat ofthe Organisation in the United States.2. At the present moment only six European States have a free vote, theUnited Kingdom, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Norway and Greece. TwoEuropean States on the Executive Committee, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia,vote as the Soviet Government directs. Iran is partly occupied by Soviet troops and afraid to offend the U.S.S.R. If these three votes had been cast freely theywould have been cast for Europe and two of the three Latin American states would almost certainly have voted for it if the majority had been the other way.The vote in the Executive Committee was thus a false one and not representativeof the feelings of the majority of the Governments and countries concerned.3. This situation is due to the present temporary weakness of Central and western Europe. They are, in fact, now in the same position as the U.S.S.R.was at the end of the last Great War. Russian interests were ignored in thelast peace with disastrous results. Similar results will follow if decisions are taken while Central and Western Europe are weak, which they will refuse toaccept when their real strength has revived.4. The United Kingdom and France are the trustees for Western Europe.There is no doubt of the strong feeling of France on this question, which m. Massigli has expressed in moving terms. If we now refuse to join with france in upholding the claims of Central and Western Europe we shall losea very valuable asset in our future policy.5. It is true that the Dominions are divided on this subject. But it is onlyAustralia, and, above all, Dr. Evatt, who press strongly for the seat in the UnitedStates. They have associated this question with the idea that the future ofthe world lies in the Pacific. It is now unlikely that San Francisco will be chosenas the site, but, nevertheless, Dr. Evatt refuses to have anything to do with Europe.Here again it is most dangerous to accept as an established fact what is largely a temporary position. As for the other Dominions, South Africa is stronglyfor Europe and, though New Zealand may be influenced by Dr. Evatt, theCanadian vote would have been cast for Europe had not Mr. Mackenzie Kingbeen on the high seas when the issue was forced upon us.6.   Strong feeling also exists among United States officials against putting the site in the United States. (See Telegram No. 6986 from Washington annexed.)The present position is largely due to the personal desires of Mr. Stettinius.  He12996   [30771]
has been assisted by M. Gromyko, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States,for reasons exactly opposite to those which moved Mr. Stettin ins himself!Mr. Stettinius claims that a site in the United States will cause the people ofthe United States to take a continuous interest in the Organisation. M. Gromykohopes that if the site is situated in the United States, the United Nations willhave less power in Europe, where Soviet interests mainly lie. The reasons ofChina are quite understandable in view of her experience at Geneva and her position as a Pacific Power, but it seems likely that Dr. Wellington Koo hasbeen pushed on by Mr. Stettinius to clinch the matter at this stage.7. Mr. Stettinius expressed the wish before he left, in direct oppositionto his previous position, that the United Nations should choose the site in theUnited States. The United States Government clearly dread the responsibilityof making such a choice, which might have great political repercussions. this fact alone shows how little suited a Great Power is for the seat of theOrganisation.8. The Executive Committee of the United Nations has already adopted areport which lays down special conditions for the seat of the Organisation. Anenclave or special regime is desired for the territory on which the United Nationscentre is to be erected and diplomatic immunity for officials is to be secured. Itis by no means certain that Congress and the legislature of the State in whichthe site is placed will readily accept such conditions.9. It seems probable at the present moment that if the site is in the UnitedStates it will be in the East rather than in the West. A number of United Statescities and communities have sent invitations which the Executive Committee isnow being asked to investigate and appraise. The city of Philadelphia is stronglyadvocating its claims and Mr. Stettinius has suggested that Hyde Park, president roosevelt&apos;s estate, might be utilised for the purpose. Such a site would certainly be preferable to San Francisco which is more than 2,000 miles from any capitalcity, an argument which obviously strongly influenced the Executive Committee.Only Australia, China and Chile are likely to support San Francisco, though theSoviet Government may also do so. Whatever the decision, it is clear that itmust really be made by the United States Government itself, however much itmay try to disguise the fact. Mr. Stettinius has suggested that a United nations commission be sent to the United States but officials at Washington have depre-cated this idea.10. It seems, therefore, probable that the United States Administration,apart from Mr. Stettinius, will not be displeased if the decision of the ExecutiveCommittee is reversed in the Preparatory Commission. It will certainly befreed from some embarrassing decisions, both as regards the site and as regardsthe conditions under which the site is to be placed It may at any rate bepossible to defer the decision as to the permanent site and to ensure that the organisational work of the Secretariat and the immediate meetings of theSecurity Council and the Economic and Social Council be held in Europe. these meetings will undoubtedly have more reality if they are not held at some spotremote from the urgent problems which they should consider, at the earliestpossible moment.11. In all the circumstances, I suggest that it would be a great mistakefor us to abandon Europe at this stage of the discussion. Our position is a quite natural one and well understood by all the other Governments. there could be no criticism of our conduct if we press strongly in Preparatory Corn-mission the desirability of a European site. On the contrary, if we do not doso, it will be considered that we have lost our power and our nerve. If we arebeaten, we shall be in a strong position to urge concessions, such as the retentionof the Geneva buildings so that the General Assembly could be held therewhen necessary, and for the meeting as often as possible of the Security Counciland Economic and Social Council in Europe. If we tamely acquiesce, theinfluence of the United States and the Soviet Union on the United Nations willbe considered by all so clearly to outweigh that of Britain and France that other States wili cease to look to us for leadership.12. The conclusion would seem to be that we should continue to supportthe view that the site should be in Europe. In such case we should instructour representatives abroad to make known the reasons for which we take up
this position. They can be stated in a manner which is in no way offensive tothe United States. Such action will be strongly supported by the French and netherlands Governments.13. Such a decision would by no means compel us to choose Geneva,difficult though it is to find another suitable site.E. B.Foreign Office, 29th October, 1945.ANNEX.The Earl of Halifax to Mr. Bevin. (Received 2\st October.)(No. 6986.  Personal and confidential.)(Telegraphic.) Washington, 21st October, 1945.YOUR telegram No. 10504.It so happens that the director of the Office of European Affairs at the state department spontaneously volunteered the following remarks quite unofficiallyto His Majesty&apos;s Minister on the 19th October.2. Matthews said that he would like us to know that the general view ofState Department officials, beginning with Mr. Byrnes, was that it would be a&quot; tragic mistake &quot; to establish the headquarters of the world organisation inthe United States remote from the scene of European issues which were likelyduring the post-war period to hold the centre of the international arena. he himself wondered whether there was anything that we could do to ensure thatthe first vote on this subject should not be endorsed by the provisional committeewhen it debated the question in November. He pointed out that the UnitedStates Government were ill placed to make any move whatever in the matter,as domestic American politics were now acutely involved with a number of leadingcities agitating in favour of their being chosen for the site. He reiterated thatthe choice of an American city, although favoured by Stettinius for personalreasons did not in the least commend itself to the State Department. He inciden-tally expressed the opinion that some Latin American countries were possiblynot keen about the proposal to establish the world organisation in this hemispherewhere it would tend to overshadow the Pan-American gatherings.3. This is a pretty fair indication that your surmise, at least as regardsByrnes&apos;s view, is correct. I will, however, take an opportunity of mentioningthe matter to him myself.   .
