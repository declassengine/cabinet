Printed for the Cabinet. -November 1945.67SECRET. . Copy No. 6CP. (45) 268.5th November, 1945.CABINET.SARAWAK.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.IN the conclusions of the Cabinet Meeting on the 3rd September (CM. (45)27th) I was invited by my colleagues to consider the possibility of bringing to anend the rule of the Rajah of Sarawak.2. I am advised that there is nothing in our formal Agreements with theRajah of Sarawak which would enable the rule of the Rajah to be brought to anend by unilateral action on the part of His Majesty&apos;s Government.But in the last few weeks there have been important developments in Sarawakaffairs which make it unnecessary to consider such action. I decided to see theRajah myself and to find out from him what his future plan and policy was for himself and the territory.3. In my memorandum (CP. (45) 133), paragraphs 12 to 14, I referred tothe fact that the Rajah appeared to be taking refuge behind the recalcitrancy of&quot; a Provisional Government&quot; which he had set up in London under his nephewand heir presumptive, Mr. Anthony Brooke, the Rajah Muda. The Rajah hasrecently sent a message to the Rajah Muda and the members of the &quot; ProvisionalGovernment &quot; to say that he has decided, in view of the end of the war with japan, to reassume all his powers and prerogatives and thus to terminate theappointment of the Rajah Muda as &quot; Officer Administering the Government,&quot;and also the functions of the Provisional Government itself. He has furtherinformed me that he wishes to make fresh arrangements in respect of the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government and Sarawak with a view not merely to establishingHis Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction in Sarawak and the appointment of a British repre-sentative in the State with the authority we desire, but also to providing for the cession of the State of Sarawak to His Majesty so that the exercise of any other authority in the State except that of His Majesty will thereupon be determined.4. He has explained, however, that, under the Constitution of Sarawak, itwill be an essential preliminary that he should obtain the consent of the Asiaticmembers of the Supreme Council of the State to his proceeding with this policyand with the conclusion of an Agreement for these purposes. He has proposed tome that his private secretary should be sent as his emissary at an early date toSarawak for the purpose of obtaining such consent. I have signified to him myreadiness to agree to this mission on certain conditions, particularly that a seniormember of the Colonial Service appointed by me, in consultation with the Rajah,should accompany his personal emissary and should at his discretion take part with the latter in all discussions on this subject in Sarawak.5. I ask for my colleagues&apos; approval of my proposal that the Rajah should for the present continue to be recognised as the ruler of Sarawak and that I shouldbe authorised to facilitate the Rajah&apos;s intentions regarding the future go\ern-ment of Sarawak and to proceed to these fresh arrangements with him as soon ashe obtains the consent of his Councillors in the territory.G. H. H.Colonial Office, S. W. 1,5th November, 1945.[30821]
