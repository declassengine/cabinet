Printed for the Cabinet, November, 1945SECRETCopy No.    5CP. (45) 28315th November, 1945.CABINETstatus of spanish nationals in the united kingdomwho were overrun by allied forges in franceMEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WAR1. Just over 220 Spaniards are accommodated in a prisoner of war camp nearChoriey. They were overrun by allied troops at the time of our advance across France.They were then wearing either German uniforms or were in German organizations. Atthe time of the German invasion of France they were refugees from Franco&apos;s Spain, andthey claim that they were forced by the Germans to join their various organizations.2. In the circumstances the Army had no option but to treat them as prisoners ofwar. They have, however, been given a number of privileges. There is no barbed wire round their quarters; they wear unpatched battledress; they may move up to fivemiles from their hostel unescorted; they may talk to members of the public and visitprivate houses by invitation. In all these respects their treatment is the same as treat-ment given to Italian Co-operators, but they do not get the special rate of pay whichwas introduced to induce the Italians to become Co-operators.3. There has been considerable public interest in these men. Mr. Kenyon was toraise the question on the adjournment on 29th October but instead he brought a deputa-tion to me on 31st October. On the whole they considered the conditions in the hostelare now about as good as they can be made, and, except in the matter of pay, the menare by and large now satisfied with the treatment they are receiving.4. They are, however, most anxious to escape from Army control altogether. this raises a number of difficult problems. At one time many were anxious to return toFrance, but it is understood that the majority now want to stay here as friendly aliens.In any case we have now heard from the French that they will not have them as freemen. They cannot be held indefinitely as prisoners of war. The Pioneer Corps hasmore men than it needs already&apos; and most of these Spaniards are over age. The HomeSecretary is reluctant to allow them to be treated as refugees and so to swell the popula-tion of foreigners in this country who have no connection with it.5. I appreciate this, but until the men can be given asylum in some other country such as Mexico or conditions in Spain enable them to return there, there seems to meto be no alternative, since it is impossible to justify their continued detention as prisonersof war.6. I therefore recommend that they should all be released as a temporary measurewith the exception of any whom the security authorities consider it essential to detain,and that the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs should continue his efforts to findthem asylum elsewhere.j- j- l.The War Office,15th November, 1945.(B45/67)   no   11/45  W.O.P.   24292
