SX12TH NOVEMBER,  19h7- &apos;cabinet public ANNOUNGEMENT ABOUT NATIONALISATION PROPOS ALS .Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council-1. I was asked by the Cabinet on the 3.6th October(C. M. (h5)U2nd Conclusions, Minute U(2)) t.o consider, withthe Minister of Fuel and Power and the other ministers concerned with the nationalisation of particular industries,the form and timing- of a public announcement about theGovernment&apos;s proposals for the nationalisation of theelectricity and gas industries.2. The Lord President&apos;s Committee has considered thematter and is in favour of an announcement indicating ingeneral terms the industries which the Government intend tosocialise during the course of the present Parliament.      I attach the draft of an announcement for the approval of mycolleagues.3, On the statements of policy contained in theannouncementj the decisions we reached at the Lord President&apos;sCommittee may, I think, be summarised as follows:-(i)    There is a clear case for the nationalisation of the gas and electricity industries.(ii)    The railways,  canals and long-distance road haulage facilities should be nationalised.Road passenger transport should be brought under public ownership but the extent towhich this involves Government - as distinct from local or other public authority -ownership will require further examination.Similarly,  the form of public ownership tobe applied in the case of docks and harbourshas not yet been worked out.(iii)    The shipping industry should be given adefinite indication that,  as in the case ofthe cotton industry, the Government doesnot propose to bring it under public owner-ship provided that it maintains the necessary,standard of efficiency.      We shall have to

examine further the rather special positionof coastwise shipping, which will have to be linked with the inland transport arrangements.(iv)    The Coalition Government asked the  ironand steel industry to produce a report onthe future development of that industry.      Weshould await the report before taking any decision whether to bring the industry under public ownership.I4. An important feature of the announcement is theadmonition addressed to the industries due for socialisationthat any necessary development must not be held up in the interim period pending the transfer of ownership.5. I would propose to make the announcement at an earlydate in the House of Commons after Questions.      I think thatwe can resist any pressure for a debate on the details of theGovernment&apos;s proposals on the ground that the object of thepresent announcement is to clear the way for the ministers concerned to enter into negotiations with the industries concerned and to formulate their proposals  in greater detail.H. M.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.12th November,  19!*5*

secret draft PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT1. The Government believe that it is in the public. interest that they should give a general  indication of thefarther measures they propose to introduce during the life ofthe present Parliament to bring certain essential services under public ownership.      This statement will enable theMinisters concerned to enter into consultation with theindustries concerned.2. As indicated in the KingTs Speech at the beginning ofthe present Session,  the Government intend to introduce a Billduring the&apos; present Session to nationalise the coal-miningindustry as part of a concerted plan for the co-ordination of-the fuel and power industries.      At a later stage in thepresent Parliament, measures will be introduced to bringunder national ownership the electricity supply industryand the gas industry.3. -       It is the intention of the Government to introduce,during the life of the present Parliament, measures designedto bring transport services,  essential to the economic well-being of the nation,  under public ownership and control.Government policy in regard to civil aviation and telecommunications-cations services has already been announced.      In regard toinland transport,   powers will be taken to bring under national ownership the railways,  canals and long distanceroad haulage services.h. As regards road passenger transport it is regardedas essential that the undertakings of the municipalities and companies should.be fully co-ordinated with the national scheme, and it must be considered whether this can best beachieved by transferring ownership to a national authority or by providing for the creation of regional or joint boardsresponsible for their own finances.      The second alternative

would make it necessary for some control to be exercised over these boards by a national authority in order to ensureconformity with general policy and their proper correlationboth with one another and with other forms of transport.5. Dock and harbour undertakings will be brought withinthe scope of the national scheme and the most appropriateform of public ownership is under examination.6. It is not the intention of the Government to propose the nationalisation of the shipping industry,  but we shallexpect the industry to comply with the necessary standardof efficiency and to have full regard to the public interest.The Government look with confidence to the shipping industry generally to play a full part in the effort towards national economic recovery and are alive to the- problems with which our shipping finds itself confronted as a result of the &apos;war.      Coastwico shipping holds, and must continue to hold,an important place in the country&apos;s transport facilities andmay be affected by the Government1s proposals for unifyingother agencies of home transport.7* The Coalition Government invited the Iron and steelindustry to submit a report on the improvements required toput the industry on an efficient operating basis.      TheGovernment proposes to await this report, which isexpected shortly, before taking decisions on the future organisation of the iron and steel industry.8. Any changes in an undertaking involving a possibleincreased claim for compensation which take place after thedate of this announcement will be closely scrutinised, whenarrangements for compensation are made.      The same datewill apply to  the iron and steel industry,  if subsequentlyit should be decided to bring it under&apos;public ownership.

9* During the interval which will necessarily elapse before the plans outlined above can be presented toParliament and carried into effect,   all necessary development in the industries concerned must be  carried on.      TheGovernment propose to see,   therefore,   that industries willnot be prejudiced if they continue to develop their under-takings in the interim period;    and the appropriated departments will enter into early consultations on the pointwith the industries concerned..      A progressive undertakingneed not fear that it will fail to receive full and fairrecoupment for any necessary and proper capital expenditureoThe compensation payable will have full regard to the extentto which adequate development and maintenance have beencarried on up to the  time of transfer of the undertaking&apos;.,
