Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1945.SECRET. Copy No.P. ACP. (45) 299.23rd November, 1945.CABINET.SHIPPING POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.IN my previous memorandum CP. (45) 135 I made proposals, which were approved by the Cabinet, on certain phases of our shipping policy, in so far as concerned our relations with other countries. In the present memorandum, report the results of recent negotiations with the United States and Canada forthe information of my colleagues (Part I), make proposals for controlling Britishtonnage after the end of February (Part II), and submit a scheme for dealingwith the disposal of tonnage now owned by the Government (Part III).PART I.My representatives who attended the meeting of the United Maritime Re^ts of^Executive Board in Washington in late September and October were able to negotiation&quot;,pursue the matters in CP. (45) 135 on the lines approved by the Cabinet withthe United States and with the other maritime countries concerned.  The resultsof these negotiations may be summarised as follows :- (i) It is agreed that the United Maritime Authority should continue in Dry cargooperation as regards dry cargo ships and passenger ships for the full     passengerperiod  permitted by  the original  Agreement,  that  is until the continuance2nd March, 1946.   This gives us time to adjust our shipping policy  negotiations^tatiieto the prospect of competitive trading with other flags but in the 2nd March,meanwhile ensures that we get the maximum shipping assistance 1946-from the European Allied flags and at the same time limits the amountof United States shipping in our trades for which payment is requiredin dollars.   My representatives came to an amicable agreement withthe United States as to the amount of United States tonnage to beemployed in our trades during the remainder of the period of opera-tion of the United Maritime Authority and thus disposed of the riskof serious dissension which threatened when the termination of Lend /Lease compelled, us to refuse the services of United States tonnage which had been of great assistance to us during the war.   At thesame time my representatives came to amicable agreement with theUnited States and other flags on the re-instatement of British sailingsin a number of liner trades where dollars are earned from which british ships were withdrawn during the war.(ii) With the termination of United States control of oil supplies and our Tankers-need to concentrate on sterling resources of oil, international control ua?A^ontoofof tanker employment through the United Maritime Authority became &apos; &apos; - con ro -impossible, and the United Maritime Authority ceased to operate inrespect of tankers as from the 31st October, 1945; but my repre-sentatives secured agreements with the Norwegian and Swedishauthorities to maintain in our service the amount of Norwegian and swedish tanker tonnage previously at our disposal under the united maritime Authority until the end of December^ and further negotia-tions have made good progress to ensure us the use of this tonnagetill March, when we anticipate that it will be safe to rely upon[30940] - b

These arrangements limited the amount of United Statestonnage, to be paid for in dollars, necessary to fulfil our needs; and my representatives secured assurances from the United States of the availability of the number of United States tankers necessary tocover us till the end of the year and have since been assured that united States tonnage will be available to us on acceptable terms tomeet our deficiencies till March:(iii) My representatives secured the agreement of the Canadian Governmentto leave with us on bareboat charter for a minimum period of 2 years,on terms to be discussed, the Canadian-built ships (about 1 million tons deadweight) which have been available to us on bareboat charterduring the war; and also agreed upon the sailings of ships under theCanadian flag which we require for the rest of the U.M.A. period.The charter terms for the Canadian ships on bareboat charter have since been discussed and it is clear that the negotiations will resultin terms that are acceptable. We have been met in a very helpfulway by the Canadian Government.(iv) My representatives were under instructions to secure if possible themaintenance in our service under the British flag on bareboat termsof the ships at present available to us from the United States Govern-ment (about 3 million tons deadweight). It is probable that we shall require these, or most of them, for 2 or 3 years while our buildingprogresses. We do not want to have to buy them in dollars. TheUnited States Administration agreed that they would take no actionto terminate the existing agreement under which we have these ships(though the agreement could also be terminated by the action of congress on which no assurances could be given). This ensures that,so far as the United States Government are concerned, the ships willcontinue in our service at least till the 2nd March, 1946. The UnitedStates Government also agreed that we might have the services ofthese ships on Lend/Lease terms until December, whereafter hire atagreed rates would be due. So far it has not been possible to agree upon the rate of hire, for the United States Government feel them-selves bound, owing to the attitude of Congress, to ask hire at a greaterrate than we consider justified by the trading possibilities. Theposition after the 2nd March will be determined by United Stateslegislation as to the disposal of Government-owned ships now underconsideration by Congress. This legislation, as passed by the Houseof Representatives, gives power to the Administration to sell shipseither to American or foreign buyers, but minimum prices are laiddown. These prices, though representing a heavy write-off of a war expenditure by the United States Exchequer, are still too high topermit us to purchase in dollars, apart from the depressing effect which purchase of so large a block of shipping would have on ship-building employment here. The legislation also authorises bareboatcharter to American charterers but not to foreigners. Acting inaccordance with their instructions, my representatives pressed for.and persuaded the American Administration to sponsor, the insertion in the legislation of power to charter on bareboat terms to foreigners,at least in respect of that amount of tonnage already on such charterunder war-time agreements. The decision of Congress on thisproposal is awaited. Meanwhile we cannot be certain that we shallbe a,ble to retain this tonnage.2. My representatives also urged the necessity for withdrawing from commercial service a large volume of the United States war-built tonnage. Thelegislation before Congress on disposal of Government-owned tonnage requires that tonnage not sold after 2 years, or redelivered from bareboat charter there-after, shall be withdrawn from commercial services. Meanwhile the UnitedStates Government stated it to be their policy to lay aside a high proportion(20-25 million tons) of their war-built tonnage.3. My representatives also explored the views of other maritime governments on the desirability of an international shipping organisation after the united maritime Authority ceases to operate. The main object of United States policyis to secure guarantees from us and other maritime countries as to the participa-tioh of United States flag tonnage in the liner trades to and from the United
States. Though their requirements in this connection are not finally clarified, ,they are expressed in the desire to have 50 per cent, of these trades under UnitedStates flag, representing a large increase over pre-war. The other maritimecountries, relying like us upon their earnings as world carriers by sea, appearunlikely to be willing to give guarantees as to the participation of any flag inparticular trades other than what can be secured on a basis of fair competitionby efficient service. The maritime countries are somewhat lukewarm upon thequestion of any intergovernmental shipping organisation after U.M.A. but look for a lead from us. The French Government is likely to support proposals foran international shipping organisation where they could if necessary present forsolution difficulties which arise for them by being a large user of shipping services with only comparatively small shipping resources under their own flag.4. I see some advantages in an international organisation, representativeof Governments, which while not being empowered or authorised to interfere in shipping operations would nevertheless provide opportunities for governments to ensure between themselves that shipping services are available on equal termswithout discrimination for the trade of all countries, that Governments do notadopt discriminatory practices in favour of their own flag which interfere withthe conduct of shipping business on a basis of fair and open competition, and thatif the necessity should arise for transport by sea to be provided for the purposesof the United Nations the participating Governments will co-operate in providingit. Any such organisation should clearly be within - the ambit of the united nations Organisation. I intend to submit proposals to the Cabinet framed onthese lines as a basis for discussion with other countries in a separate papervery shortly. I should see some dangers in the type of organisation which mightbe proposed by other countries if we fail to give a lead and adopt merely a negative attitude.5. Meanwhile we must make progress with our own national shippingpolicy and two issues call for decision : (i) The question whether control should continue to be exercised over UnitedKingdom tonnage by the Government after the 2nd March; and if so,in what form; and(ii) the disposal of Government-owned tonnage.PART II.-CONTROL OF BRITISH TONNAGE AFTER 2nd MARCH.6. Our international obligation, under the Agreement on Principles estab-lishing the United Maritime Authority, to maintain our ships on requisition endson the 2nd March. The existing agreement as to the terms for British ships under requisition ends at the same time.7.   The passenger ships and other ships employed directly in military or j^l^Jg^naval service must clearly remain at Government disposal until our requirements ships onare fulfilled.  I propose only to release these ships from requisition as the trooping militaryand other requirements permit, meanwhile arranging the terms for the ships fortheir  continued  service  under  the  existing  powers.    Any  ships  requiredadditionally for such purposes will be dealt with in the same manner.   But i must emphasise the importance of reducing the allocation of merchant ships to naval and military purposes to a minimum as rapidly as possible if we areto recover, with our depleted tonnage resources, anything like our old positionin the world&apos;s carrying trade.8.   As regards tankers, I have made proposals in my separate paper. Tankers.L.P. (45) 248.9.   As regards dry cargo tonnage other than that referred to in paragraph 7. Dry cargoI consider the circumstances require the maintenance of some form of Government   her-thancontrol for some further period after the 2nd March.   We need powers to ensure ships onthat sufficient of the limited tonnage at our disposal is made available for the ^rvio^cargoes of the importing Ministries and for other essential purposes of Govern-ment; (if we should succeed in the negotiations for the United States tonnagedescribed in paragraph 1 (iv), we may be able to relax control on this accountsomewhat earlier than would otherwise be the case).   On the other hand, wemust restore quickly the power to compete with other flags to the fullest possible extent.   For this reason, it is no longer desirable as a general principle that[30940] B 2
Arrangementsfor Liners.British owners should continue during this transition period to be protected by-time charter terms under requisition to the Government from the full financial responsibility for their operations. I propose to develop a plan in-, respect ofocean-going dry cargo tonnage on the following lines.10. Liners would be reinstated so far as practicable in their accustomedtrades and the period of requisition vail terminate with the expiry of currentagreements (that is on the termination of voyages current at the 2nd March)provided I can be satisfied that thereafter : *(i) Priority will be given to Government or sponsored traffic,(ii) Rates of freight for Government traffic will be determined&quot; at areasonable level to my satisfaction,(iii) Tonnage can be concentrated on the routes where it is required forGovernment traffic irrespective of ownership.   This will particularlyapply to specialised types such as refrigerated tonnage.11. I can enforce such arrangements under the powers to license voyagesand other existing powers and shall, of course, give no promise not to resortagain to requisitioning powers to meet essential Government requirements if theneed should arise.Arrangementsfor TrampTonnage.Organisation&apos;6r charteringforeign tramptonnage.12. As regards tramp tonnage, the requisition should terminate on the expiry of current agreements in March. The arrangements thereafter wouldprovide for *(i) A block of tonnage, the amount of which would be determined by reference to the requirements of the importing Ministries and other government traffic or services, should be at the absolute disposal ofmy Ministry as to its employment. The amount of this directedtonnage would be determined from time to time but covering a sub-stantial period ahead, as the estimated requirements may necessitate,(ii) The rates of freight for the traffic for which this directed tonnagewill be available under direction by my Ministry to the importingMinistries and for other Government traffic would be determined by my Ministry on fair and reasonable terms. In appropriate cases shipsmight be time chartered. Directed tonnage will be fixed voyage byvoyage at the scheduled rates of freight to the importing Ministriesor other charterers on Government account,(iii) The remaining tramp tonnage would be free to fix at the initiative of owners for any business either at the schedule rates or, where noneexists, on market terms, subject to licence by my Ministry.13. The amount of directed tonnage would be adjusted periodically toestimated requirements, being progressively reduced until the situation permitsthe complete restoration of market conditions.14. Special financial arrangements might require to be made in respectof ships, whether liners or tramps, which were directed into other than their normal trades or were required to make exceptional voyages.15. I propose to release from requisition as soon as possible ships tradingcoastwise in the United Kingdom. As regards tonnage in the short sea trade,I propose to follow the general lines set out above with suitable adaptations to circumstances in that trade. As part of our general policy for internal transport,we must have proper regard to the interests of coastwise shipping.16. As a corollary to these arrangements for British tonnage, I should propose to establish a suitable organisation on the London freight market through which foreign tonnage available for tramp chartering will be sought and offeredunder Ministry direction for fixture by the importing Ministries. This will enablethe volume of foreign chartering and rates of freight to be regulated in accordancewith our general policy. This organisation would of course only act for Govern-ment business; private British charterers will be free to take foreign tonnage for their own purposes on market terms. The same Ministry organisation on theBaltic would be available to sponsor the chartering of any &quot; free &quot; British tonnage which may be available and required for Government charterers in addition tothe directed tonnage.
PART III.-DISPOSAL OF GOVERNMENT-OWNED SHIPS.17. Under the scheme hitherto in operation and not yet formally withdrawnGovernment-owned ships are offered for sale to British owners, on a rota accordingto type and date of loss of their ships during the war. They are sold at cost tothe Government less depreciation at 6 per cent, per annum. A number of shipsbuilt in the United Kingdom to Government order have been disposed of underthis scheme. We have now to reconsider the terms on which to dispose ofremaining Government-owned tonnage and to bring into effect a new scheme assoon as possible, appropriate to present circumstances and prospects.18. Legislation which is expected to be passed in the United States in thevery near future provides for the disposal of the ships built on account of theUnited States Government. Under this legislation a high proportion of the costof building the ships will be borne by the United States Exchequer as part of thecost of the war. By way of example, the &quot;Liberty &quot; type of merchant ship ofabout 10,000 tons d.w., which cost the United States an average of about 400,000 each to build, may be disposed of at a minimum price of  140,000.The Canadian Government are also seeking to dispose of comparable ships at about  120,000 each. These prices are very much below the price at which our government-owned ships are available under the present disposal scheme.19. Many of the Government-owned ships built or acquired during the war have a substantial period of useful service in front of them; but, as the UnitedStates and Canadian Governments have recognised, the terms upon which theycan be disposed of must take into account that they were built and designed forwar-time purposes, and at high war-time cost. These elements must be discountedin any broad plan for disposing of the ships now that the war is over.20. We have to be careful in our plans for disposal not to run the risk of reducing unduly the orders from British owners in our shipbuilding yards, inwhich we aim to maintain a high level of activity in the coming years; similarlywe should not discourage the shipping industry from employing as large a proportion as possible of their financial resources available for building in theproduction of ships of type and design likely to be able to hold their own againstOther flags under highly competitive conditions.21. The ships available for disposal include the remainder of the ships built in the United Kingdom to Government order during the war, some built in theUnited States to our order, and some second-hand purchases, as well as the ships which have fallen into our hands as prizes of war or will come to us as part ofour share of the German Mercantile fleet. For present purposes all these shipsmay be classified into three groups (i) Those types which are likely to have special usefulness because of thegeneral shortage in those types. This applies specially to passengervessels, cargo liners, intermediate tramps, motor tramps and ocean-going tankers.(ii) Those types which are useful primarily as filling temporary gaps in ourmerchant fleet. This class includes the standard tramp steamers, ofabout 10,000 deadweight tons, which we have built in this countryand America during the war.(iii) Those types, mainly small craft, which have been built or obtainedspecially for war purposes and have little, if any, usefulness for peace-time trading.22. I propose that the new disposal scheme should be developed on thefollowing lines : 23. For the ships built in this country forming part of the group (i), Ipropose first to average the cost of building those that remain and then to makedeductions on account of their less desirable war-time features and accrueddepreciation to a level which will have regard to comparable American and canadian offers of tonnage. These ships would be offered for sale, to operatorsestablished in the United Kingdom and for registry in the United Kingdom, byinviting bids for each ship with the proviso that no bid would be accepted belowthe minimum price established as above.24. Other ships in this group would be dealt with in a similar manner, theminimum price being determined by the Ministry with the advice of valuers, oncomparable lines.
25. As regards ships in group (ii), I believe that it would be desirable tooffer the alternative of purchase or long-term bareboat charter to United Kingdomoperators. The minimum sale price of each of the ships built to our order inthe United Kingdom could be fixed as for those in group (i). The bareboatrate of hire would be a fixed annual percentage of this minimum price. I should aim at bareboat charters for a, period of seven years with a minimum of, say,five years in appropriate cases.26. I should propose to put the ships in group (ii) built to our order in theUnited States into the scheme on the same basis as similar ships built in theUnited Kingdom, thus discounting entirely the higher cost of building in theUnited States.27. Other tonnage in this group (e.g., prizes of comparable type) would bedealt with in a similar way, the minimum sale price being established with theadvice of valuers on a comparable basis.28. I am assuming that all the ships in groups (i) and (ii) will be requiredfor service under.our own flag, at any rate for some years, so that to begin with,none of them should be offered abroad. During the war we have made availableto our European Allies a proportion of the ships built for or otherwise acquired by the Government. A final allocation was made early this year, not all of whichhas been taken up by the Allies. These countries have also the opportunity ofbuilding in this country. We are under no obligation to offer any more of theGovernment-owned tonnage to these nations, but we might dispose of any tonnageleft on our hands to these or other countries, on suitable terms, as soon as we canspare it from the United Kingdom register.29. Government-owned tonnage in groups (i) and (ii) not disposed of underthe above arrangements would continue to be traded for Ministry account. ships in group (iii) should be sold as opportunity offers, either at home or abroad, atthe best price obtainable.30. I should propose to offer the ships on bareboat charter to the Ministryfrom the Canadian Government, under the agreement now being concluded, Onsub-charter to United Kingdom operators, for the duration of our charters. from canada and on terms which would cover the Ministry&apos;s obligations to theCanadian Government. If we succeed in obtaining ships on bareboat charterfrom the United States, I should propose to proceed on similar lines.SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS.31: I summarise my principal recommendations on the points requiring,immediatioh decision as follows : (a) Control of British tonnage (paragraphs 6 to 15).(i) Subject to (a) (iii) below, I propose to release from requisition in march next, when existing agreements expire, ocean-going dry cargo ships,both liners and tramps, but to maintain control of the employment ofsuch ships through other means to the extent necessary to ensure thatspace on liners, and tramp tonnage, is available in sufficient quantityat reasonable rates for Government traffic, including, of course, therequirements of the importing Ministries (see paragraph 10 as regardsliners, paragraph 12 as regards tramps).No new powers will be required to enforce such control. Thepower to license voyages already exists and requisitioning powers willremain for&apos; use in emergency if need be.The arrangements I propose are for a transitional period andcontrol will be relaxed as circumstances warrant.(ii) I propose to proceed on similar lines for tonnage in the short sea trades.Requisitioned ships in the Coasting trade will also be released as soonas possible (paragraph 15).(iii) Requisitioning powers will continue to be used to retain or take uppassenger ships required for trooping and other ships employeddirectly in military or naval service, but it is important to reduce theallocation of merchant ships to these purposes as rapidly as possible(paragraph. 7).(iv) Arrangements for the control of tankers, suitable to their special case,were submitted in my paper L.P. (45) 248.
(b) Foreign tonnage. I propose to establish a suitable organisation through which foreign tonnage available for tramp chartering will be sought and offeredunder Ministry direction for the requirements of the importing Ministries(paragraph 16).(c) Disposal of Government-owned tonnage (paragraphs 17 to 29). Ipropose to terminate forthwith the existing scheme under which Government-owned tonnage is disposed of to private operators at cost price and to replaceit by a new schdiiiM to come into effect immediately. The new scheme will be worked out on the following lines : (i) Ships of specially useful types will be offered for sale to any UnitedKingdom operator at the best price bid over a fixed minimum (para-graphs 23 and 24).(ii) Ships of types primarily useful as filling the gaps for the time being inour merchant fleet will be offered to United Kingdom operators for saleat a fixed minimum price, with the alternative of bareboat charter fora period (not less than five years) at a rate of hire representing a fixedannual percentage of the minimum price (paragraphs 25 to 27).(iii) The minimum prices referred to in (c) (i) and (ii) will be determined for ships built in the United Kingdom by averaging cost of construc-tion and by reduction on account of the less desirable features of thesewar-time standard ships and the reduced prices at which such ships are being offered by the United States and Canadian Governments.Minimum prices of other ships for disposal under (c) (i) and (ii) willbe determined by valuation on a comparable basis. I propose todiscount altogether the extra cost of building in the United States theships we still have for disposal which were built there for our account(paragraph 26).(iv) Save in a quite exceptional case, none of these ships will be disposed ofto foreign flags until our tonnage situation permits (paragraph 28).(v) Ships and craft built or obtained for special war-time purposes andwhich have little or no useful peace-time purpose will be disposed of as opportunity offers, at home or abroad, at the best price obtainable(paragraph 29).(vi) Ships at our disposal on bareboat charter from the Canadian Govern-ment will be sub-chaxtered. to United Kingdom operators on terms which will cover our liability to the Canadian Government. AnyUnited States ships available to us would be disposed of on similar lines (paragraph 30).A. B.Ministry of War Transport,23rd November, 1945.
