(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)g E C R E T ui--copy  j CP. (45) ,,298 -1--83RD NOVEMBER. .1945CABINETNATIONAL HEALTH. SERVICESAhB.AND PURCHASE OP MEDICAL.PRACTICESMemorandum, by the Minister of health i propose in this Paper that when a National health service is established -(i)    the sale and purchase of medical practices(being practices conducted wholly or partlywithin the public service) should stop;(ii)    doctors &quot;who are thereby deprived of existingselling values should receive compensationbased on 1939 standards of practice valuesand payable only on the doctor&apos; s death or. retirement from practice;(iii)    all doctors taking any part in the publicservice in future should join in a newcontributory superannuation scheme,2.      I also propose that, in order to clear up the present- uncertainty with which young doctors from the Forces or elsewhere are faced, some announcement of the Government&apos;general intentions should be made at once.3&quot;.      The White Paper on the National Health Service referredto this question.      It proposed that, if and where its proposals destroyed the value of existing practices,compensation would be paid.      Two possible examples weregiven;    the first, where the taking over of a practice by anew-comer was prohibited in an &quot;over-doctored&quot; area;    thesecond, where a doctor gave up his separate practice to takeservice in a Health Centre.      But in general, it was not considered that the proposals in the White paper would themselves destroy the value of practices.     The White paperwent on to recognise the case which could be made on meritsfor the abolition of the whole custom of sale and purchase,in publicly remunerated practices, and suggested discussionof this with the profession,4*     The Coalition Government made a public announcement, on 3rd May last, that they did not propose to abolish sale and purchase at present;    that an inquiry by a Committee would beset on foot after the National Health Service was inoperation and after experience of its working had beenobtained;    that if, as a result of that inquiry, the sale of

practices should he controlled, proper compensation would he paid.      The full text of this announcement is appended.Doctors from the Forces and others are naturally asking whether this, announcement still holds good and,  if not, whatis the position.      They are entitled to an early answer.Uncertainty is also causing hardship among the older doctors who have kpt on during the war and now want to retire, and among the dependants of doctors who die.5.      On merits, I am sure that it is wrong that publicmedical practices - practices or parts of practices whichdepend for their value on public -remunderation under aNational Health Service - should be bought and sold.      Inspite of the freedom of patients to change their doctor in apublic service,  the custom amounts very nearly to the  sale and purchase of patients and therefore of a public income.However much it may be mitigated by loans of cheap money or.otherwise, it must tend to deter the poorer recruit fromprofessional practice^      It is also particularly unsuitableto public practice organised in publicly provided health centres.6,      But - apart from the merits of the custom as such - adirect result of a provision which I am satisfied must (forother reasons) be incorporated in the new service will bethat the selling value of all xoublicly remunerated practiceswill be destroyed anyway.      The provision to which I refer isthe vesting of a power in the. Minister (probably actingthrough a specially appointed professional body) to approveor select the general practitioner to replace a practitionerin the public service who has died or retired.      Thisprovision will in effect put an end to any market in practicesaffected by it.7.        It is arguable that an action by the State in theinterests of the community which has incidentally destoyredthe value of an existing practice gives rise to no betterclaim to compensation than many similar actions whichincidentally destroy the &quot;good-will&quot; attaching to particularbusinesses.      There are, however, special features in thepresent case.      The destruction of values will scarcely be&quot;incidental&quot;;    it will be a very direct result of positive action by the Government,     Also, if no compensation weregiven there would be many cases of. hardship among people who have (quite properly, in the light of the custom of theirprofession at the time) incurred considerable liabilities inthe purchase of practices, and who have acquired in the selling values of their practices their principal insurance for old age and for their dependants in the event of death.There is also the practical point that great hostility wouldbe aroused in the profession, at the very time when we wanttheir utmost co-operation, if practice values were destroyedwithout compensation,ation0      Moreover the White Paper has alreadyfirmly coupled compensation with the destroying of practicevalues in the doctors&apos; minds.8.      I think therefore, that there should be compesnation(although without admitting an inherent right to it on the doctors&apos; part) and I think that it should be devised broadlyon the basis of restoring what is destroyed by the Government&apos;s

action.      The exact basis of compensation and. its methodswill need, to be discussed with the professions spokesmenbefore final decision, hut I think that the object  should beto secure their agreement to arrangements on these lines:- .(l)   At a given date when the scheme starts, to assess the value of practices then existingon the basis of t\he income derived from them during the preceding year,(*2)    To discount the abnormal conditions which have affected practice values since 1939 by reducing the above assessed values to a1939 level, i.e. by applying a reductionfactor which will take into account rises in fees, capitation payments, etc.,   since that date, and by taking for purposes of calculation the number of years&apos; purchase,normally paid in 1939.(3)    To arrive at a global figure of compensationby aggregating all the reduced values soarrived, at;    and to invite the medical profession themselves to propose how thetotal shall be equitably apportionedbetween individual practices.(4)    To make payments to each doctor on retirement(or to his dependants on death) in accordancewith that basis of apportionment.(5)    To allow for a reasonable rate of interest onthe apportioned capital value in respect ofthe period elapsing before it is actually paid to the doctor or his dependants - asseme recompense for the  interest on loanswhich he may have to continue to meet or theinterest value of his tied-up money,  so as toreduce any unfair anomaly between doctor anddoctor when all receive their remuneration atthe same rates in future from public funds.9.      Independently of these arrangements for compensation,I propose to take power to set up a superannuation schemefor. all doctors taking part in the new service.      (no account would be taken of past service under the presentnational health insurance arrangements or other service before the operation of the superannuat ion scheme, since the doctors concerned would be adequately compensated in thisrespect by the scheme set out above),      Mere again thedetails will require tc be worked cut at some length, inconsultation with the profession, but the general principleswould be: -(i)    Contribution by trie doctors,  supplemented equallyby contribution by the state (something likethe scheme already applicable to school teachers)(ii)    Benefits to consist of a pension on retirement anda lump sum payment on retirement or death,subject tc orthodox provision for qualifyingperiods of contribution;w3-

(iii)    The scheme to he capable of application, ifpossible, to a wider field than general practice and to cover all doctors participating in anyfield of the new service - and probably to becorrelated with similar schemes for other .classes and groups of employees in the health service.10.    It is not necessary to decide now exactly how these things shall be done.      It is necessary, however, to,decide whether they shall be done and to make some general announce-ment y/hich will give a pointer to young doctors in deciding what their course&apos; of action should be in the next few months.If my colleagues agree with my proposals in principle Ishould like to be authorised to make an immediate announcement on the following lines: -(i)    The Government have no yet finally decided upon theproposals which they will be .submitting to Parliament for aNational Health Service.(2)    They believe, however that it will be incompatible with the provision of an efficient service that the futureexchange of medical practices, and the creation of newpractices, within that  service should he left entirelyunregulated and that no effective steps should be taken tosecure a xoroper distribution of doctors to fit the publicneed.(3)    They appreciate that intervention in this field -in whatever form it may take - will probably have theeffect of preventing the sale and purchase of the practicesof doctors taking any part in the new service, and theGovernment  therefore think it right to give warning of thisprobability at once and in advance of the formulation oftheir full proposals.(4)    At the same time, and in order to allay the naturalanxieties of doctors already in practice or now coming intopractice from the Forces or elsewhere,  the Government wishto make it clear that there will be an appropriate measureof compensation to doctors in respect of loss of capitalvalues directly caused by the new arrangements.  .   It isintended that discussions should be undertaken immediatelywith the profession&apos;s representatives with regard to the steps to be taken to give effect to this decision.11.   -When this statement has been made, I will at onceinitiate discussions with the profession, not only on thebasis and&quot; method of compensation in general, but also onany special measures necessary in the interests of doctors   -.and their dependants who wish to dispose of practices, andnewcomers who desire to enter practice, before the operationof the compensation arrangements.      I shall suggest to the profession that they should themselves take steps to meetdifficulties arising in this interim period and should announce as soon as possible what they are doing.(Intld.)

.   A F P-E N D I XCOPY OF COALITION GOVERNMENTS ANNQUNOEMENTgj STOREY:      To ask the Minister of Health whether hehas any-statement to make on the sale and purchase of medical practices in relation to the Government&apos;s proposalsfor a National Health Service.MR. WILLINK:    Yes, Sir.    The Government recognise, asindicated in the White Paper,  that a case can he made forthe total abolition of the sale and purchase of publiclyremunerated practices, and particularly of practices con-ducted in publicly provided health centres.The Government also recognise, as indicated in theWhite Paper, that the abolition would involve groatpractical difficulty and is not essential to the initiation of the new service.The Government feel that firm decisions, dealing withthe practical difficulties fairly in the -interests of allconcerned if sale and purchase wore to be abolished, couldbe reached only after.some experience had been gained ofthe working of the new service and all the relevant factshad been ascertained.The Government do not propose, therefore, to make any alteration in the present custom in the forthcoming health services Bill, but they propose that a full inquiry intothe whole question shall be instituted by a Committeeappointed for that pur-pose after the new service has comeinto operation and experience of its working has been gained.Meanwhile, to remove any present uncertainty, theGovernment wish to make it clear that, if the sale ofpractices - as a result of the inquiry I have mentioned -should be abolished or restricted by law, doctors affectedwould receive all proper compensation,  on the understanding,of course,  that (as indicated in the White Paper) the new service could, not be allowed, by itself increasing values,to increase the amount of compensation payable.The Government also recognise that, pending the inquiry, many doctors will bo returning from the Forces andentering new civil practices under the existing conditionsof practice exchange.    They are anxious that these men andwomen shall not .be prevented or discouraged from, doing soby inability to find purchase money, and they are discussing with the Profession, how this can best be secured.Non-oral Answer3rd May, 191+5
