Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.The circulation of this paper has been straeiiy limited, it is issued for the persona! yse of .................................................................TOP SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 297.21th November, 1945.CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.ON the 6th November the Cabinet considered the negotiations on commercial policy with the United States and gave their approval to the results then reached.Since then, we have been in touch with our negotiators in Washington aboutthe way in which our approval of the proposals should be expressed. There havealso been considerable telegraphic exchanges with the Dominions.2. I undertook to submit in due course a draft of a statement I proposedto make welcoming the American initiative. Annex A to this paper snows thestatement which I should propose to make, subject, of course, to a satisfactory conclusion of the financial side of the negotiations. This statement is necessarilyin general terms, but I should bring to the notice of my colleagues three points : (a) Paragraph 3 has been prepared in consultation with the Dominions Officeand is designed to meet the situation that Australia and New Zealandhave unfortunately not been prepared to express their general approvalof the result (the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs has cir-culated a separate paper (CP. (45) 295) on this aspect).(b) Paragraph 4 looks forward to a full debate on the commercial policyproposals. I am anxious that this should take place in order that theGovernment may have the best and earliest opportunity of explaining to Parliament and public opinion here the background of thecommercial policy proposals and why they are in our interests.(c) Paragraphs 8 to 12 deal rather fully with the Imperial Preference issue and contain the final text of the &apos;&apos; explanation &apos;&apos; which has beenagreed with the Americans as the interpretation we are entitled toput on the formula dealing with tariffs and preferences, which now appears in its proper place in the American proposals (see Annex Cto this paper, Chapter III, section B).3. For the convenience of my colleagues I attach at Annex B a shortsummary of the American proposals, which was before them at the last meeting and to which they then gave their assent. At Annex C is the full text of theAmerican proposals. Annex D gives the text of another American document which has been agreed with our negotiators and sets out the manner in whichit is proposed that the American document should be submitted first of all toa group of the major trading nations (including all the Dominions and India)and later to a United Nations conference.4.   The remaining question is whether, on the assumption that the financial negotiations end in agreement, we should express to the Americans in a moreformal way our general support of their commercial proposals.   They pointout, of course, that in order that the financial agreement (if reached) may have[30929] b
a favourable reception in Congress it will be necessary for them to point to thefact that we are in general support of the commercial policy proposals. once the debate which I suggest has taken place, there is no difficulty. If for their purpose a verbal assurance from our negotiators that we intend to commend theproposals to Parliament is not sufficient, the problem is what can be said tothem before the debate has taken place. It is, in my view, and I believe, in thatof the Americans (see Annex D, paragraph 1), important that the proposals should appear as an American initiative. From the point of view both of theDominions and of Parliament we cannot commit ourselves at the prepublicationstage in any document which might subsequently become public to more than an assurance that we shall seek Parliamentary backing- for our attitude to theproposals.5. I therefore seek the approval of my colleagues to the suggestion thatif the Americans press for it the Ambassador should be authorised to inform them (not for publication at this stage) that His Majesty&apos;s Government intend,in the course of the Parliamentary debate which is expected to take place afterpublication, to express fully their support of the American initiative and tomake clear their welcome for the proposals as a basis for international discussion. The Ambassador could go on to say that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill associate themselves with the substance of the proposals in the Americandocument and will express their intention to use their best endeavours, in thelight of the views expressed by other countries, to carry the proposed international discussions to a successful conclusion.R. S. C.Board of Trade, MUlbank, S.W. 1,24th November, 1945.ANNEX A.Draft Statement for use in Parliament on the United States commercial policy Proposals.HIS Majesty&apos;s Government welcome the initiative of the Governmentof the United States in publishing their proposals for setting up an Inter-national Trade Organisation and will be glad to play their part in any international discussions which eventuate on this most important subject.2. The proposals which have been published represent not only theconstructive thought of the United States Government but also the culminationof a long process of study and exchange of ideas between our own experts andthose of the United States.3. During this preparatory period extending over two years our expertsheld a series of informal and most valuable consultations with experts from theDominions and India who made a number of very helpful contributions on thevarious topics discussed. The recent talks in Washington preceding thepublication of the United States document, were, of course, conducted on behalfof the United Kingdom alone, and I am not in a position to speak for our partners in the Commonwealth, none of whom are in any way committed andwho will each, no doubt, state their views themselves. I would only say here that while we have kept closely in touch with them during the conversations,it is quite understood that each of the Governments concerned will be able to approach the international discussions with full freedom of action in relationto the various matters dealt with in the proposals.4. The House will no doubt wish to have a full discussion upon theseproposals before any international conference takes place, but it would perhaps be convenient for me to take this earliest opportunity of remarking upon certainbroad aspects of the American document.5. I should make it clear that this proposal is put forward by the UnitedStates Government with the object of formulating a basis for an international conference at which their suggestions will be subjected to full discussion before any final agreement is arrived at. Nevertheless, His Majesty&apos;s Government inwelcoming these proposals, desire to express their agreement with the broad
objectives aimed at, that is to draw up a code of conduct for international ....commerce and facilitate its expansion, so as to secure as far as is possible full employment at rising standards of living in all the countries participating &quot;Inthe scheme.6. In the interests of the balance of payments of the United Kingdom,which depends upon the import of food-stuffs and raw materials, it is essentialto clear the obstacles to our exports of manufactured goods without abandoning the right to control our imports so long as this is essential to our balance ofinternational payments. The document recognises this fundamental fact. Itis to be noted that the preamble to the document stresses the vital need for highand stable levels of employment in all countries, and the necessity for ailcountries to adopt domestic measures for the preservation of a high level ofeconomic activity. It is, of course, the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentto adopt such measures. But the success of our domestic measures will be assisted, and the expansion of our export trade will be greatly promoted, if other countries also adopt appropriate domestic policies for high and stablelevels of employment. For this reason His Majesty&apos;s Government particularlywelcome this statement of the need for appropriate domestic employmentpolicies.7. There is one particular matter arising out of the terms of Article VIIof the Mutual Aid Agreement which is of especial interest and importance tothe British Commonwealth and Empire that is the question of tariff preferences.I would therefore refer shortly to that aspect of the American document which deals with both tariffs and tariff preferences.8. The statement sets forth the procedure to be followed by common consent in considering, in the context of a general lowering of tariffs and other trade barriers, what contribution can be made from our side by way of reduction orelimination of preferences.9. The statement makes it clear that, in pursuit of the objectives ofArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreement, we for our part are ready to agreethat the existing system of preferences within the British Commonwealth andthe Empire will be contracted provided there is adequate compensation in theform of improvement in trading conditions between Commonwealth and empire countries and the rest of the world.10. The statement further provides that in entering negotiations for thereduction of tariffs the parties concerned will not refuse to discuss the modificationof particular preferences on the ground that these are the subject of priorcommitments; on the contrary, all margins of preference will be regarded asopen to negotiation, and it will of course be for the party negotiating the modification of any margin of preference which it is bound by an existing commit-ment to give a third party, to obtain the consent of the third party concerned.11.   Further points to be noted are :-(i) The statement makes it clear there is no commitment on any countryin advance of negotiations to reduce or eliminate any particularmargin of preference. The position is that each country remains free to judge in the light of the offers made by all the others, the extentof the contribution it can make towards the realisation of the agreedobjectives.(ii) It is recognised that reduction or elimination of preferences can onlybe considered in relation to and in return for reductions of tariffs and other barriers to World Trade in general which would make formutually advantageous arrangements for the expansion of trade.There is thus no question of any unilateral surrender of preferences.There must be adequate compensation for all parties affected.12. The statement does not in advance of the detailed negotiations lay downhow far the process of reduction and elimination of preferences will be carriedat this immediate stage. It must be realised that some preferences are ofparticular importance to the economy of certain parts of the world just as sometariffs are important in others. The elimination of all preferences would be such a step as would require a most substantial and widespread reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers by a large number of countries. Thus it is[30929] &apos; B 2
recognised that the degree to which the final objectives can be reached at the initial stage can only appear at the negotiations themselves and as the resultof a mutually advantageous settlement.13. There are numerous other proposals in the document dealing withgeneral and export subsidies, quantitative restrictions, State trading, restrictivebusiness practices and commodity arrangements, and also with the proposed international Trade Organisation, with which I will not now deal.14. Both the United States and the United Kingdom intend well in advanceof the International Conference to carry on between themselves and othercountries, including of course in our case British Commonwealth countries,preliminary negotiations upon the subjects dealt with in the American document,in order to prepare the way for and contribute to the success of the international conference when it meets. It is hoped that at the International conference which it is proposed to hold in the summer of next year, these negotiations willbe completed on a full international basis and that the International trade organisation can be brought into being.15. As I have said, His Majesty&apos;s Government give their support to this attempt to work out the policy set out in Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agree-ment and adumbrated in the Atlantic Charter. They earnestly hope that all thecountries participating in the meeting will find it possible to make suchconcessions in their existing tariffs, trade barriers and preferences as to lead. to their mutual satisfaction and that thus the way may be open to proceed to the setting up of a world trade organisation which can contain within it everyform of public and private international commerce and can at the same time,by bringing some measure of order into future trade and commercial relations&apos;contribute to that expansion of international commerce and attainment of full employment on which the future of all countries and particularly our own depends so much.ANNEX B.Summary of United States Proposal to Establish an International trade organisation.Inter-Relation of Trade and Employment Problems and Measures.HIGH and stable levels of employment are essential for an enlarged volumeof trade. Prosperity in each nation depends on the prosperity of other nations,the levels of employment in the major industrial nations having an especially important influence in this respect. Accordingly there should be an undertaking that (1) Each signatory nation will take appropriate action designed to securefull employment within its own jurisdiction.(2) Maintenance of employment should not be sought through measures whichaggravate the trade and employment problems of other nations.Proposal to Establish an International Trade Organisation.Measures designed to expand trade are essential to reach maximumemployment, production and consumption. To attain these objects continuousinternational collaboration will be necessary. It is accordingly proposed toestablish an International Trade Organisation of the United Nations, themembers of which would undertake to conduct their international commercialpolicies and relations in accordance with agreed principles to be set forth inthe articles of the Organisation.Chapter I. Purposes and Principles of the Organisation.These would aim at effective expansion of world production, employment,and the exchange and consumption of goods.Chapter II.-Membership.This is purely formal.
Chapter III. Principles relating to Commercial Policy.a. &quot;General Commercial Provisions.There would be a body of rules of the kind normally found in commercial treaties governing, e.g., internal duties, transit duties, anti-dumping duties,tariff valuations, marks of origin, &amp;c. The working-out of these rules in detailwould fall to the International Trade Organisation.B. Tariffs and Equality of Tariff Treatment.Countries should take effective and expeditious steps, on lines to be agreed,to bring about substantial reductions of tariffs and elimination of tariff preferences. Emergency action to prevent sudden and widespread unemployment would be provided for.C. &quot;Quantitative Restrictions.The member countries would undertake in general not to maintain anyimport or export restrictions, subject to the following main exceptions : -(1) restrictions required in the early post-war transition period, to economiseshipping space, to secure equitable distribution of products in short supply, and for the orderly liquidation of war surplus stocks in thehands of Governments;(2) restrictions required to relieve conditions of distress in exporting countries due to shortages of food-stuffs or other essential products;(3) import quotas on agricultural products necessary to the enforcement of govermental measures (a) restricting marketing or production; or(b) intended to dispose of temporary domestic surpluses;(4) to safeguard the balance of payments.D. Subsidies.1. Genercd subsidies would be permitted; but members should inform theOrganisation and be prepared to discuss their action if the subsidy increasesexports or diminishes imports.2. Export subsidies. These are disapproved. Three years after the end ofhostilities, members granting such subsidies would undertake to discuss their action.3. Commodities in world surplus.- The provisions of 1 and 2 above wouldnot apply to commodities declared by the Organisation to be in burdensome worldsurplus if inter-governmental action had failed to suggest other ways of removing the surplus. Even then the subsidy should not increase the export share of thecountry concerned.E-State Trading.1. Equality of Treatment. Members should accord equality of treatment toother members. For this purpose their State trading enterprises, in makingpurchases and sales, should be guided solely by commercial considerations, suchas price, quality, terms of sale, &amp;c.2. State monopolies of individual products.- State trading is not to intro-duce greater protective or preferential margins than would be allowed as a resultof tariff negotiations.3. Complete State monopolies of foreign trade: Countries should undertake to purchase from other members, on a non-discriminatory basis,products valued at not less than an aggregate amount to be agreed upon.F. Exchange Control.This is dealt with by reference to. the International Monetary FundAgreement.Chapter IV. -Principles relating to Restrictive Business Practices.This chapter begins by declaring that certain types of business practice (ofwhich examples are given)&quot; may impede full employment policies and the objects of the convention.
Any member may bring to the notice of the Organisation a complaint thatthe objectives of the document are being frustrated by restrictive businesspractices of international character. The Organisation is then to investigate thematter and, if the complaint is found justified, may make recommendations to theGovernments of the offending business concern for action under their own laws.Chapter V. -Principles relating to inter-Governmental CommodityArrangements.1. Inter-governmental commodity arrangements involving restrictions on production or trade may be desirable to facilitate adjustments and the solution of problems affecting particular commodities, thus avoiding resort to unilateral action by the countries affected.2. Such arrangements, if they involve limitation of production or exports orallocation of markets, should not be entered into unless and until the organisation has (1) investigated the root causes of the problem; and (2) has determined that aburdensome world surplus exists which cannot be corrected by the play of marketforces; and unless a programme of adjustment has been prepared and adopted bymembers, calculated to solve the problem in a reasonable time.3. Governing Principles. The following principles should govern inter -gpvernmental commodity arrangements : (a) they should be open on equal terms to all members; (b) members substantially dependent on imports of the commodityconcerned should have an equal voice with exporting countries; (c) they shouldassure adequate supplies for world consumption at all times at reasonable prices;(d) they should provide increasing opportunities for meeting world requirements from sources able to supply them most effectively.4. Such arrangements should not remain in effect initially for more than five years; if renewed, it must be shown that substantial progress towards solutionof the underlying problem has been made or is in prospect.5. Existing or future inter-governmental commodity arrangements shouldbe submitted to the Organisation for review.Chapter VI. Organisation.The International Trade Organisation, its functions, organisation, and rules of procedure, and its relation to other international organisations, are dealt within detail.

PROPOSALS FOR CONSIDERATION BY AN international conference ON TRADE AND EMPLOYMENT.A. NEED FOR INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION.1. Collective measures to safeguard the peoples of the world againstthreats to peace and to reach just settlements of disputes among nations mustbe based not only on international machinery to deal directly with disputes and to prevent aggression, but also on economic co-operation among nations with the object of preventing and removing economic and social maladjust-ments, of achieving fairness and equity in economic relations between states,and of raising the level of economic well-being among all peoples.2. Important contributions have already been made toward the attain-ment of these objectives. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of theUnited Nations has been established. An International Monetary Fund to &apos;maintain reasonable exchange stability and facilitate adjustment in thebalance of payments of member countries, and an International Bank for reconstruction and Development to provide financial resources on a co-operative basis for those purposes are awaiting the action of Governmentsrequired for their establishment.3. In order to reach the objectives of the Atlantic Charter and Article VIIof the mutual-aid agreements, it is essential that the co-operative economic measures already taken or recommended be supplemented by further measures dealing directly with trade barriers and discriminations which standin the way of an expansion of multilateral trade and by an undertaking on thepart of nations to seek full employment.4. Co-operative action with respect to trade and employment is indispens-able to the success of such other measures as those dealing with monetary and exchange stability and the flow of investment capital. Effective actionin regard to employment and to trade barriers and discriminations must,therefore, be taken or the whole program of international economic co-operation will fail, and an economic environment conducive to themaintenance of peaceful international relations will not be created.B.   PROPOSALS CONCERNING EMPLOYMENT.Since high and stable levels of employment are a necessary condition foran enlarged volume of trade, and since problems of trade and employment are   to be considered jointly at an international conference, the followingpropositions are advanced.Governing Principles.1.   It is recognised that:a In all countries high and stable employment is a main condition for- the attainment of satisfactory levels of living.b The attainment of approximately full employment by the major industrial and trading nations, and its maintenance on a reasonablyassured basis, are essential to the expansion of international trade on which the full prosperity of these and other nations depends;to the full realisation of the objectives of all liberal international agreements in such fields as commercial policy, commodityproblems, restrictive business practices, monetary stabilisation, and investment; and, therefore, to the preservation of world peace and security.2. Domestic programmes to expand employment should be consistent with realisation of the purposes of liberal international agreements andcompatible with the economic well-being of other nations.3. It is recognised that the adoption of the Bretton Woods agreements and of measures to reduce restrictions on trade will contribute substantially to the maintenance of productive employment.4. ^ The United Nations have pledged, in the Charter of the United nations organisation, to take joint and separate action in co-operation with theOrganisation to achieve the economic and social purposes of the united nations, including higher standards of living, full employment, and conditionsof economic and social progress and development.Effectuation of Aims.There should be an undertaking that:1 Each of the signatory nations will take action designed to achieve and maintain full employment within its own jurisdiction, throughmeasures appropriate to its political and economic institutions.2 No nation will seek to maintain employment through measures whichare likely to create unemployment in other countries or which areincompatible with international undertakings designed to promotean expanding volume of international trade and investment inaccordance with comparative efficiencies of production.
3 Signatory nations will make arrangements, both individually andcollaboratively under the general sponsorship of the Economic and social Council of the United Nations Organisation, for thecollection, analysis and exchange of information on employmentproblems, trends, and policies.4 Signatory nations will, under the general sponsorship of the Economicand Social Council, consult regularly on employment problems andhold special conferences in ease of threat of widespread unemploy-ment.C.   PROPOSALS CONCERNING AN INTERNATIONAL trade organisation.Need for an International Trade Organisation.1. Measures designed to effect an expansion of trade are essential becauseof their direct contribution to maximum levels of employment, productionand consumption. Since such expansion can only be attained by collectivemeasures, in continuous operation and adaptable to economic changes, it isnecessary to establish permanent machinery for international collaboration in matters affecting international commerce, with a view to continuousconsultation, the provision of expert advice, the formulation of agreed policies,procedures and plans, and to the development of agreed rules of conduct inregard to matters affecting international trade.2. It is accordingly proposed that there be created an international trade Organisation of the United Nations, the members of which would undertake to conduct their, international commercial policies and relations inaccordance with agreed principles to be set forth in the articles of theOrganisation. These principles, in order to make possible an effective expan-sion of world production, employment, exchange and consumption, should:a   provide an equitable basis for dealing with the problems of govern-mental measures affecting international trade;b   provide for the curbing of restrictive trade practices resulting from private international business arrangements; andc   govern the institution and operation of inter-governmental commodityarrangements.Proposed International Trade Organisation.There follows an outline of the principles which it is proposed should be incorporated in the articles of the Organisation.Chapter I.Purposes.The purposes of the Organisation should be:1 To promote international commercial co-operation by establishingmachinery for consultation and collaboration among member governments regarding the solutions of problems in the field ofinternational commercial policies and relations.2 To enable members to avoid recourse to measures destructive of world commerce by providing, on a reciprocal and mutuallyadvantageous basis, expanding opportunities for their trade andeconomic development.3 To facilitate access by all members, on equal terms, to the trade andto the raw materials of the world which are needed for their economic prosperity.4 In general, to promote national and international action for theexpansion of the production, exchange and consumption of goods,for the reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers, and for the elimination of all forms of discriminatory treatment in internationalcommerce; thus contributing to an expanding world economy, tothe establishment and maintenance in all countries of high levels of employment and real income, and to the creation of economicconditions conducive to the maintenance of world peace.Chapter II.Membership.The original members of the Organisation should be those countries participating in the Conference on Trade and Employment which acceptmembership.Chapter III.General Commercial Policy.Section A.   General Commercial Provisions.Members should undertake :1 To accord to products imported from other members treatment no less favourable than that accorded to domestic products with regardto matters affecting the internal taxation and regulation of thetrade in goods.
2 To provide, for products in transit through their territories, coming from or going to other members, freedom from customs and transitduties, from unreasonable transit charges, and from discriminatorytreatment of all kinds.3 To subscribe to a general definition of the circumstances under whichantidumping and countervailing duties may properly be applied toproducts imported from other members.4 To give effect, as soon as practicable, to agreed principles of tariffvaluation designed to assure the use of true commercial values asa basis for assessing duties, and to co-operate with other members and with the Organisation in working out internationally acceptablevaluation procedures of a standardised character.5 To give effect, as soon as practicable, to agreed principles lookingtoward the simplification of customs formalities with a view toeliminating unnecessary requirements which afford an indirectprotection to domestic products.6 To eliminate excessive requirements regarding marks of origin in sofar as they affect products imported from other members.7 To refrain from governmentally financed or organised boycotts orcampaigns designed to discourage, directly or indirectly, importationor consumption of products of other members.- 8 To provide for adequate publicity regarding laws and regulationsaffecting foreign trade, and to maintain or establish national. tribunals of an independent character to review and correctadministrative customs action.9 To transmit to the Organisation appropriate trade information and statistics.10   To co-operate with the Organisation and with other members incarrying out or implementing the articles of the Organisation.Section B.   Tariffs and Preferences.1. Import tariffs and preferences. In the light of the principles setforth in Article VII of the mutual-aid agreements, members should enter intoarrangements for the substantial reduction of tariffs and for the elimination of tariff preferences, action for the elimination of tariff preferences being takenin conjunction with adequate measures for the substantial reduction of barriersto world trade, as part of the mutually advantageous international arrange-ments contemplated in this document.As an initial step in the process of eliminating tariff preferences it shouldbe agreed that:a Existing international commitments will not be permitted to standin the way of action agreed upon with respect to tariff preferences.b All negotiated reductions in most-favoured-nation tariffs will operateautomatically to reduce or eliminate margins of preference.c Margins of preference on any product will in no case be increased andno new preferences will be introduced.2. Export tariffs and preferences. Export duties should be open to negotiation in the same way as import duties. Members should undertake not to impose or maintain export duties which differentiate by reference tothe destinations to which the goods are exported.3. Emergency action. Commitments with regard to tariffs should permitcountries to take temporary action to prevent sudden and widespread injury to the producers concerned. Undertakings for reducing tariffs should thereforecontain an escape clause to cover such contingencies.Section C.   Quantitative Trade Restrictions.1. General elimination of quantitative restrictions. Except as providedfor elsewhere in this Chapter, members should undertake not to maintainany quotas, embargoes, or other quantitative restrictions on their export orimport trade with other members. This undertaking should not, however,apply to the following :a Import and export prohibitions or restrictions, imposed during theearly post-war transitional period, which are essential to (a) the efficient use of shipping space in short supply, (b) the equitableinternational distribution of products in short supply, or (c) the orderly liquidation of temporary surpluses of Government stocksaccumulated as a result of the war. Such prohibitions and restric-tions should be removed not later than three years after the close of hostilities, but provision should be made whereby this periodmay be extended with the concurrence of the Organisation.b Export prohibitions or restrictions temporarily imposed to relieveconditions of distress in the exporting country caused by severeshortages of foodstuffs or other essential products.c Export prohibitions or restrictions necessary to the application ofsuitable standards for the classification and grading of commodities in international commerce.
d Export or import quotas imposed under inter-governmental commodity agreements conforming to the principles set forth in Chapter V.e Import quotas on agricultural products, imported in any form,necessary to the enforcement of governmental measures whichoperate (a) to restrict the quantities of like domestic products whichmay be marketed or produced, or (6) to remove a temporary surplusof like domestic products by making such surpluses available tocertain groups of domestic consumers free of charge or at pricesbelow the current market level. Such quotas should not be more restrictive than necessary, should be removed as soon as they cease to be necessary for the purposes of this sub-paragraph, and shouldbe made the subject of periodic consultation with the Organisation.If such quotas are allocated among sources of supply, they shouldbe allocated fairly, on the basis of imports during a previousrepresentative period, account being taken in so far as practicableof any special factors which may have affected or which may beaffecting the trade in the product concerned. Import quotasimposed under (a) of this sub-paragraph should not be such as would reduce imports relatively to domestic production as comparedwith the proportion prevailing in a previous representative period,account being taken in so far as practicable of any special factors which may have affected or which may be affecting the trade inthe product concerned.2. Restrictions to safeguard the balance of payments. Membersconfronted with an adverse balance of payments should be entitled to imposequantitative import restrictions as an aid to the restoration of equilibrium inthe balance of payments. This provision should be operative under conditions and procedures to be agreed upon.   These conditions and proceduresa. should set forth criteria and requirements in the light of whichbalance-of-payments restrictions might be imposed;b should, as regards the use of such restrictions in the post-wartransitional period, be framed on principles which would be designed to promote the maximum development of multilateral trade during that period and which in no event would be more restrictive of such trade than the principles applicable, underArticle XIV of the International Monetary Fund Agreement, tothe use of exchange restrictions in the transitional period;c should provide for the determination of the transitional period forthe purposes of sub-paragraph b, above, by a procedure analogous to that contained in Article XIV of the International monetary fund Agreement;d should provide for the full application of non-discrimination in theuse of such restrictions after the transitional period; ande should make appropriate provision for international consultationregarding balance-of-payments restrictions, whether imposedduring the transitional period or thereafter.3. Equality of treatment. Quantitative restrictions imposed on balance-of-payments grounds should be deemed non-discriminatory if they are administered on a basis which does not discriminate among sources of supply in respect of any imported product.a In the case of restrictions imposed in the form of quotas, membersimposing such quotas should publish the global amounts or values of the various products which will be permitted to be importedduring a specified future period. Any allocation of such quotasamong sources of supply should be based insofar as practicableupon the proportion of the total imports of the product in questionsupplied by the various member countries in a previous representa-tive period, account being taken of any special factors which mayhave affected or which may be affecting the trade in that product.b In the case of restrictions not imposed in the form of quotas, the member imposing the restrictions should undertake to provide,upon the request of any other member having an interest in the product concerned, all relevant information as to the administra-tion of the restriction, including information as to the importlicenses granted over a past period and the distribution of suchlicenses among sources of supply.c Any member should be entitled to raise with the Organisation thequestion as to whether another member was imposing balance-of-payments, restrictions, whether in the form of quotas or other-wise, in a manner not in harmony with the guiding principlesstated above or in a manner which unnecessarily injured its com-merce, and the member imposing the restrictions should undertakein these circumstances to discuss the grounds on which it had acted.4. Inconvertible currencies. The undertakings set forth in paragraph 3,above, should not apply in cases in which their application would have theeffect of preventing a member from utilising inconvertible currencies forbuying needed imports.
5. Scarce currencies and currencies of territories having a common quotain the Monetary Fund. Members should not be precluded by this Sectionfrom applying quantitative restrictions a) in pursuance of action which theymay take under Article VII of the International Monetary Fund Agreement,relating to scarce currencies, or b) in a manner designed to maintain the far value of the currencies of territories having a common quota in the monetary Fund, in accordance with Article XX, Section 4 (g) of that agreement.6. Application of quantitative restrictions by state-trading organisa-tions. The provisions of this Section relating to quantitative restrictions on imports for balance-of-payments reasons should apply equally to therestriction of imports by state-trading organisations for the same reasons.Section D.   Subsidies.1. Subsidies in general. Subject to the provisions of paragraphs 2 and 3,below, members granting any subsidy which operates to increase exports orreduce imports should undertake to keep the Organisation informed as tothe extent and nature of the subsidy, as to the reason therefor and as to theprobable effects on trade. They should also be prepared, in cases where,under procedures approved by the Organisation, it is agreed that serious injury to international trade threatens to result from the operation of thesubsidy, to discuss with other members or with the Organisation possiblelimitations on the quantity of the domestic product subsidised. In thisparagraph, the term &apos;&apos; subsidy &apos;&apos; includes any form of internal income or price support.2. Export subsidies. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 3, below,members should undertake not to take any action which would result in thesale of a product in export markets at a price lower than the comparableprice charged for the like product to buyers in the home market, due allow-ance being made for differences in conditions and terms of sale, for differences in taxation, and for other differences affecting price comparability. this undertaking should take effect, at latest, within three years of the establish-ment of the Organisation. If at the end of that time any member considersitself unable to comply with the undertaking in respect of any particularcommodity or commodities, it should inform the Organisation, with an explanation of the reasons. It should then be decided by consultation amongthe interested members under procedures approved by the Organisationwhether there should be some further extension of time for the memberdesiring it in respect of the commodity or commodities concerned.3.   Commodities in surplus supply.a When it is determined, in accordance with procedures approved bythe Organisation, that a commodity is, or is likely to become inburdensome world surplus, the members which are importantproducers or consumers of the commodity should agree to consult together with a view to promoting consumption increases, topromoting the reduction of production through the diversion of resources from uneconomic production, and to seeking, if necessary,the conclusion of an inter-governmental commodity arrangement accordance with the principles of Chapter V.b If, however, within a reasonable time to be agreed upon, such steps should fail of their object, the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2,above, should cease to apply to such product until such time asit has been agreed under procedures approved by the organisation that those provisions should be re-applied to it.c With regard to any export subsidies which may be imposed under sub-paragraph b, no member should employ such subsidies soas to enlarge its share of the world market, as compared withthe share prevailing in a previous representative period. Thequestion as to what period would be representative in respectof the particular product concerned should be a subject for international consultation through the Organisation.Section E.   State Trading.1. Equality of treatment. Members engaging in state trading in any form should accord equality of treatment to all other members. To thisend, members should undertake that the foreign purchases and sales oftheir state-trading enterprises shall be influenced solely by commercial considerations, such as price, quality, marketability, transportation and terms of purchase or sale.2. State monopolies of individual products. Members maintaining astate monopoly in respect of any product should undertake to negotiate, inthe manner contemplated for tariffs, the maximum protective marginbetween the landed price of the product and the price at which the product(of whatever origin, domestic or foreign) is sold in the home market.Members newly establishing such monopolies should agree not to createprotective margins greater than the tariffs which may have been negotiated
in regard to those products. Unless the product is subject to rationing, the monopoly should offer for sale such quantities of the product as will besufficient to satisfy the full domestic demand.3. Complete state monopolies of foreign trade. As the counterpart of tariff reductions and other actions to encourage an expansion of multilateral trade by other members, members having a complete state monopoly offoreign trade should undertake to purchase annually from members, on thenon-discriminatory basis referred to in paragraph 1, above, products valued at not less than an aggregate amount to be agreed upon. This globalpurchase arrangement should be subject to periodic adjustment in consulta-tibn with the Organisation.Section F.   Exchange Control.1. Relation to the International Monetary Fund. In order to avoid the imposition of trade restrictions and discriminations through exchangetechniques, the members of the International Trade Organisation shouldabide by the exchange principles established pursuant to the Articles ofAgreement of the International Monetary Fund and for this reason it shouldbe required that the Organisation and the Fund have a common membership.2. Equality of Exchange Treatment. Members maintaining or estab-lishing exchange restrictions should undertake to accord to the trade ofother members the equality of treatment with respect to all aspects of such restrictions required under the provisions of the Articles of Agreement ofthe International Monetary Fund or, in cases where the approval of theFund is required, the equality - of treatment prescribed by the Fund afterconsultation with the International Trade Organisation.Section G.   General Exceptions.The undertakings in this Chapter should not be construed to preventmembers from adopting or enforcing measures 1   necessary to protect public morals;2   necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;3 relating to the traffic in arms, ammunition and implements ofwar, and, in exceptional circumstances, all other military supplies;4   relating to the importation or exportation of gold or silver;5 necessary to induce compliance with laws or regulations, such asthose relating to customs enforcement, deceptive practices, andthe protection of patents, trademarks and copyrights, which arenot inconsistent with the purposes of the Organisation;6   relating to prison-made goods;7   imposed for the protection of national treasures of artistic, historicor archaeological value;8   undertaken in pursuance of obligations for the maintenance of peace and security; or  imposed, in exceptional cases, in accordance with a recommendationof the Organisation formulated in accordance with criteria and procedures to be agreed upon.Section H.   Territorial Application of Chapter III.1. Customs territories. The provisions of Chapter III should applyto the customs territories of the members. If any member hasmore than one customs territory under its jurisdiction, each customsterritory should be considered a separate member for the purpose of applying the provisions of Chapter III.2. Frontier traffic and customs unions. The provisions of Chapter IIIshould not prevent and member a) from according advantages to adjacentcountries in order to facilitate frontier traffic or b) from joining a customs union, provided that such customs union meets certain agreed criteria.Members proposing to join- a customs union should consult with theOrganisation and should make available to it such information as wouldenable it to make appropriate reports and recommendations.Chapter IV.Restrictive Business Practice.1. Curbing of restrictive business practices. There should be individual and concerted efforts by members of the Organisation to curb those restric-tive. business practices in international trade (such as combinations oragreements to fix prices and terms of sale, divide markets or territories,limit production or exports, suppress technology or invention, exclude enter-prises from particular fields, or boycott or discriminate against particularfirms) which have the effect of frustrating the objectives of the organisation to promote expansion of production and trade, equal access to markets and raw materials, and the maintenance in all countries of high levels ofemployment and real income.
2. Go-operation among members. In order to achieve the purposesof paragraph 1, the Organisation should be charged with the furtherance of this objective. The Organisation should receive complains from anymember (or, with the permission of the member, from commercial enter-prises within its jurisdiction who allege that their interests are affected),that the objectives of the Organisation are being frustrated by a privateinternational combination or agreement. The Organisation should beempowered to call upon any member to provide information relevant tosuch a complaint; it should consider such data and, if warranted, make recommendations to the appropriate members for action in accordancewith their respective laws and procedures; it should be empowered to request reports from members as to their actions in implementing such recommendations, and to report thereon. The Organisation should also beauthorised, within the scope of its subject matter, to conduct studies, tomake recommendations concerning uniform national standards, and to callconferences of member States for purposes of general consultation.3. Continued effectiveness of national laws and regulations directed against restrictive business practices. Any act or failure to act on the partof the Organisation should not preclude any member from enforcing within its own jurisdiction any national statute or decree directed toward the elimination or prevention of restrictive business practices in international trade.4. Special enforcement arrangements. It should be provided that members may, by mutual accord, co-operate in measures for the purposeof making more effective any remedial order which has been issued by aduly authorised agency of another member.Chapter V.Inter-governmental Commodity Arrangements.The production of, and trade in, primary commodities is exposed tocertain difficulties different in character from those which generally exist in the case of manufactured goods; and these difficulties, if serious, mayhave such widespread repercussions as to prejudice the prospect of thegeneral policy of economic expansion. Members should therefore agree upon the procedure which should be adopted to deal with such difficulties.1.   Special commodity studies.a Special studies should be made in accordance with the procedureset forth in b, below, of the position of particular commoditiesof which excess supplies exist or are threatened, to the end that, if possible, consumption may be increased and the antici-pated difficulties may thereby be averted.b Members substantially interested in the production or consumptionof a particular commodity should be entitled, if they considerthat special difficulties exist or are expected to arise regardingthat commodity, to ask that a special study of that commoditybe made, and the Organisation, if it finds that these representa-tions are well founded, should invite the members principally con-cerned in the production or consumption of that commodity toappoint representatives to a Study Group to make a specialstudy of that commodity.2. Inter-govermnental commodity conferences. If it is concluded, inthe light of an investigation of the root causes of the problem, that measures for increasing the consumption of a commodity are unlikely to operatequickly enough to prevent excess supplies of the commodity from accumu-lating, the members may ask the Organisation to convene an inter-governmental conference for the purpose of framing an inter-governmentalcommodity agreement for the commodity concerned.3. Objectives of inter-governmental commodity agreements. It shouldbe recognised that inter-governmental commodity agreements involvingrestrictions on production or trade would be justified in the circumstancesstated in paragraph 2 above to achieve the following objectives :  a To enable member countries to find solutions to particular commodityproblems without resorting to unilateral action that tends toshift the burden of their problems to other countries.b To prevent or alleviate the serious economic problems which may arise when, owing to the difficulties of finding alternative employ-ment, production adjustments cannot be effected by the freeplay of market forces as rapidly as the circumstances require.c To provide a period of transition which will afford oppor-tunities for the orderly solution of particular commodity prob-lems by agreement between member Governments upon aprogram of over-all economic adjustments designed to promote a shift of resources and man-power out of over-expanded industriesinto new and productive occupations.
4. Principles of inter-governmental commodity agreements. members should undertake to adhere to the following principles governing the insti-tution of inter-governmental commodity agreements:o Members having an interest in the production or consumption of any commodity for which an inter-governmental commodity agreement is proposed, should be entitled to participate in the consideration ofthe proposed agreement.b Members should undertake not to enter into inter-governmental com-modify agreements involving the limitation of production or exportsor the allocation of markets, except after:1) Investigation by the Study Group of the root, causes of theproblem which gave rise to the proposal;2) Determination, in accordance with procedures approved by theOrganisation, either:a) that a burdensome surplus of the product concerned has developed or is developing in international trade andis accompanied by widespread distress to smallproducers accounting for a substantial proportion ofthe total output and that these conditions cannot be corrected by the normal play of competitive forcesbecause, in the case of the product concerned, a sub-stantial reduction of price leads neither to a signifi-cant increase in consumption nor to a significantdecrease in production; orb) that widespread unemployment,  unrelated to generalbusiness conditions, has developed or is developing inrespect of the industry concerned and that suchunemployment cannot be corrected by the normalplay of competitive forces rapidly enough to preventwidespread and undue hardship to workers because,in the case of the industry concerned, i) a substantial reduction of employment, and ii) the resultingincrease in consumption but leads instead to thereduction of employment, and ii) the resultingunemployment cannot be remedied by normalprocesses of reallocation ;3) Formulation and adoption by members of a programme ofeconomic adjustment believed to be adequate to insuresubstantial progress toward solution of the problem withinthe time limits of the agreement.c Inter-governmental agreements involving the limitation of production or exports or the allocation of markets in respect of fabricatedproducts should not be resorted to unless the Organisation finds thatexceptional circumstances justify such action. Such agreements should be subject to the principles set forth in this Chapter, and, inaddition, to any other requirements which the Organisation mayestablish.5. Operation of commodity agreements. Members should undertake to adhere to the following principles governing the operation of inter-governmental commodity agreements:  a The agreements should be open to accession by any member on termsnot less favourable than those accorded to members parties thereto.b The members adhering to such agreements which are largely dependent for consumption on imports of the commodity involved should, in any determinations made relating to the regulation ofprices, trade, stocks, or production, have together a voice equalto those largely interested in obtaining export markets for their production.c The agreements should, when necessary, contain provisions forassuring the availability of supplies adequate at all times for worldconsumption requirements at reasonable prices.d The agreements should, with due regard to the transitional need for preventing serious economic and social dislocation, makeappropriate provision to afford increasing opportunities forsatisfying world requirements from sources from which such requirements can be supplied most effectively.6. Termination and renewal of commodity agreements. Inter-govern-mental commodity agreements should not remain initially in effect for morethan five years. The renewal of an agreement should be subject to theprinciples governing new agreements set forth in paragraph 4, above, and. tothe additional principle that either a) substantial progress toward a solutionof the underlying problem shall have been accomplished during the initial period of the agreement or that 6) the renewed agreement is so revisedas to be effective for this purpose.
7. Review of commodity agreements. Members should undertake to transmit to the Organisation, for review, inter-governmental commodity agreements in which they now participate or in which they propose toparticipate in the future. Members should also transmit to the Organisationappropriate information regarding the formulation, provisions and operationof such agreements.8. Publicity. Full publicity should be given to any commodity agree-ment proposed or concluded, to the statements of considerations and objee-tives advanced by the proposing members, to the operation of the agreements,and to the nature and development of measures adopted to correct the underlying situation which gave rise to the agreement.9. Exceptions. The provisions of Chapter V are not designed to coverinternational agreements relating to the protection of public morals; theprotection of human, animal or plant life or health; the conservation of reserves of exhaustible natural resources; the control of internationalmonopoly situations; or the equitable distribution of commodities in short supply. However, such agreements should not be used to accomplish resultsinconsistent with the objectives of Chapter IV or Chapter V. If any such agreement involves the restriction of production or of international trade, itshould not be adopted unless authorised or provided for by a multilateralconvention subscribed to by a substantial number of nations, or unlessoperated under the Organisation.Chapter VI.Organisation.Section A.

ANNEX D.Procedure for Negotiating and Implementing the &quot; Proposals forConsideration by an International Conference on Trade and Employment.AS soon as possible after the current discussions between the United Statesand the United Kingdom regarding the &quot; Proposals for Consideration by an..International Conference on Trade and Employment &quot; (Annex C) have beencompleted, the United States should publish the Proposals, together with acondensed statement of objectives, as the work of American experts. This state-ment would (a) set forth the substance of the Proposals (as amended in the courseof the current discussions), (&amp;) indicate the view of the United States Governmentthat an international conference on trade and employment should be called not later than the summer of 1948 to consider it, (c) indicate that the United states would be prepared to urge that the United Nations Organisation call such a con-ference as one of their first important acts, and (d) urge that, in view of the complexity of the trade-barrier problem, Governments immediately begin negotia-tions on this subject with a view to contributing to the success of the conference.2. This statement should be published about the middle of November 1945.At the same time, the diplomatic missions of the United States should delivercopies to the Governments of all countries with which it maintains diplomatic relations (with one or two possible exceptions) for their information and comment.Both publication and delivery would be so worded as not to imply any invitation to the conference.3. The United Kingdom might thereafter wish to associate itself in someway with the substance of the Proposals.4. At the time of publication under 2 above, the United States should address invitations to the Governments of the United Kingdom, Canada,Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, India, France, Belgium,Netherlands, U.S.S.R., China, Brazil, Cuba and Czechoslovakia asking them to designate representatives to meet in some time in the spring of 1946 for the purpose of negotiating with regard to trade barriers inaccordance with the suggestion in the statement of objectives. The invitationswould make it clear that the results of the negotiations would be such as would be&quot;open to all countries of like mind &quot; in the language of Article VII of the mutual-aid agreements.5. The United States, in accordance with the requirements under the trade agreements Act, should issue public notice of intention to negotiate with those governments which have accepted the invitation referred to in 4 above, such notice to be accompanied by a list of the products of which the other countries are, or are likely to become, principal suppliers and on which concessions by the UnitedStates would be considered.6.   At the meeting in in the spring of 1946, each country should present a schedule of the tariff concessions which it would be prepared toinclude in an agreement with the other countries, such an agreement also to con-tain mutually acceptable provisions dealing with tariff preferences and non-tarifftrade barriers. Each country should also be prepared to make requests of thetariff concessions which it desires to receive from the others.7. The tariff concessions in the schedule proposed by each country should be offered to all the other countries as a group. Each country would thus obtain inits own right all of the concessions made by each of the other countries. -8. With regard to non-tariff trade barriers, there should be included in thedraft agreement provisions, uniformly applicable to the trade of all participants,giving effect to the objectives as to non-tariff trade barriers which are set forth in Chapter III of the Proposals (e.g., elimination of exchange controls, regulationof subsidies, abolition of quotas, &amp;c)..9. These discussions would also afford opportunity for consultation amongthe drafting countries regarding all other elements in the Proposals (i.e., questionsof employment, commodity policy, cartel policy, and an international trade organisation). Since many of these countries will undoubtedly also be membersof the Economic and Social Council it should not be difficult to keep the Councilinformed of the progress of these discussions in connection with its own work of
preparing for the conference. Lack of progress on these matters, either in the drafting group or in the Economic and Social Council, should not be permitted to delay the opening of the conference beyond the summer of 1946.10. The tentative agreement among the drafting countries (excluding thetariff schedules) would be subject to change at the conference, in the light ofthe considerations advanced by other countries.11. The conference should also consider the questions of adherence to theagieement and the treatment to be accorded by countries which accept the agree-ment to the trade of those which do not accept it and of any countries not invitedto participate in the conference. The drafting countries should propose that non-drafting countries be considered as provisionally adhering to the agreement upon acceptance of (a) the non-tariff provisions, and (&amp;) a commitment to under-take bilateral tariff negotiations with the other countries adhering to the agree-ment. Countries considered as adhering provisionally before they have completedtariff negotiations must be required to give adequate concessions in return forbenefits which they receive as a result of other tariff negotiations alreadyconcluded. The drafting countries should also propose that, subject to exceptions for particular countries recommended by the proposed international trade Organisation, the benefits of the agreement should, after a reasonable period of time, be withheld from the trade of those countries which failedto adhere to it, and that the tariff concessions should similarly be withheld from the trade of countries which, having adhered, failed to negotiatetariff reductions judged by the International Trade Organisation to be in con-formity with the spirit of the agreement. Drafting countries and provisionallyadhering countries should retain full liberty of action to determine whether toextend most-favoured-nation treatment to the trade of countries not invited toparticipate in the conference and not immediately eligible to adhere to the con-vention. Decision in such cases would presumably be influenced by the adequacy of arrangements made by the non-adhering countries in liberatising their trademore or less part passu with the action taken by adhering countries. Findingsand reports of the proposed International Trade Organisation regarding the tradeand commercial policies of non-adhering countries might assist adhering countriesin reaching such decisions.12. Upon the close of the conference the agreement would be brought intoforce among the drafting countries and such other countries as would join, inaccordance with their constitutional procedures.
