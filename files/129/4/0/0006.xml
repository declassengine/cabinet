THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 256.29th October, 1945.CABINET.REPORT FOR THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 1945 FOR THEDOMINIONS, INDIA, BURMA AND THE COLONIES and mandated   TERRITORIES.THE DOMINIONS.Report by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.[&apos; CANADA.[THE first session of Canada&apos;s 20th Parliament was opened on the;   6th September.   The personality of the new Parliament is very different from that! i   of its predecessor.   There are nearly 100 new members in the Commons and 18newly appointed Senators.   Both Progressive-Conservative and C.C.F. parties1   have increased their numbers considerably.    Before the formal opening thei   Members of the House met to elect Dr. Gaspard Fauteux, of Montreal, as Speaker&apos;   in succession to Mr. J. A. Glen, who was recently appointed Minister for Mines: i   and Resources.   The Speech from the Throne stressed the importance of thereconversion problems, but gave only vague indications of the Government&apos;spolicies.  It stressed that every effort was being made to speed demobilisation, and;    outlined a comprehensive Social Security programme.   The speech also contained1   an undertaking to introduce legislation to provide for a distinctive Canadian1   flag, and for a revision and clarification of the definition of Canadian citizenship.2.   When Japan signed the formal articles of unconditional surrender to theAllies on the 1st September, Colonel Moore Cosgrave, the military attache in the;j   Canadian High Commissioner^ office at Canberra, signed on behalf of Canada.i 3.   Mr. Mackenzie King announced that, as Parliament would be in sessionI during September, neither he nor any of his Ministers would be free to attend theforeign Ministers&apos; Conference in London. There has been some press criticismI of the Prime Minister&apos;s decision on the ground that it is not consistent with herI aspirations as a middle Power. The fact that the Australian Minister forI   External Affairs was present made the criticism all the more bitter.4.   Owing to the sudden ending of the war against Japan, Canada enteredI the reconversion period sooner than had been expected, and the &quot; tapering-off &quot;i process has therefore been much shorter.     The cancellation of war contracts1 naturally brought about mass lay-offs from munitions plants, shipyards, and war1 industries of all kinds, which have overtaxed the labour machine.   The trans-I ference of workers from one industry to another is a long and complicated process,n and more than 1,300,000 persons had to be dealt with by the National employment Service between the 2nd June and early August.   Arrangements have now been completed between the Department of Labour and the Army to speed up releases,l] The system is especially designed to facilitate the release of men who will be ableI to fill vacancies in certain specified industries the most important being house-I building.  In general, the policy of &quot; first in, first out &quot; will be followed.I-       5.   A two-year &quot;interim &quot; force will be established until the size and com-;    Position of Canada&apos;s post-war Regular Army is determined.    This force will[30768] b
continue in being until the 30th September, 1947; and any person joining it willbe subject to duty anywhere inside or outside Canada. An Air Force is also to beset up on similar lines.6. Another serious educational crisis arose in Montreal early in September,when 1,600 Roman Catholic teachers threatened to strike unless the decision of aspecial arbitration board to increase the teachers&apos; salaries was implemented. the montreal Catholic School Commission eventually agreed to pay salary arrears bythe 20th November.7. The Arbitration Tribunal established to consider the Seed Grain Loandispute between the Dominion Government and the Saskatchewan provincial government has given a decision in favour of the Dominion. The Tribunalmajority declared that the Federal Government had acted within its rights whenit withheld money due to the Saskatchewan Government under the tax agreementof 1941, because the Provincial Government had failed to repay its Seed GrainDebt, which the Dominion Government had guaranteed.8. At the end of August Mr. MacMillan resigned as Premier of NovaScotia. Mr. MacMillan, who is 74, has been active in the political life of NovaScotia for more than forty years. At the Nova Scotia Liberal Convention on the31st August, Mr. Agnus L. MacDonald, who recently resigned from the DominionCabinet, in which he had served as Minister of National Defence for NavalServices, was unanimously re-elected to the leadership of the provincial liberal party. On the 8th September Mr. MacDonald was sw^orn in as Premier of NovaScotia, and later announced that an election would be held in the Province on the23rd October.9. General de Gaulle, accompanied by France&apos;s Foreign Minister, paid a brief visit to Ottawa at the end of August. Major-General Vanier, the CanadianAmbassador to France, was also present to take part in the welcome to general de Gaulle. Other visitors during the month have been Dr. T. V. Soong, PrimeMinister of China, and Lord Keynes.Economic.10. Meat rationing was reintroduced in Canada on the 10th September atthe rate of about 2 lb. of carcase meat per person each week. It had been discon-tinued at the end of February 1944 because lack of shipping for export had caused large supplies of meat to pile up. With more shipping now available, there introduction of rationing should enable Canada to increase meat exports to thiscountry and to Europe. The Canadian Government have, however, been facedwith considerable opposition in bringing the scheme into operation, particularly from retail butchers; on the other hand, Press editorials have generally emphasised the need for rationing in order to increase supplies of the United Kingdom andliberated areas.11. As a result of discussions towards the end of September between repre-sentatives of retail butchers and the Wartime Prices and Trade Board, it was announced in the Canadian Parliament on the 21st September that there wouldbe a temporary removal of rationing, for six or seven weeks, of such items asfancy meats, kidneys, livers, &amp;c.12. It is recognised that this concession much affects the effectiveness of thescheme, and that if it is thought impracticable to bring these meats back on the ration, then some other step will need to be taken to keep overall meat consumptionwithin, the target set (e.g., a widening of the gap between coupon validity dates).The Minister of Finance has stated that the Canadian authorities are determined that meat rationing should remain in force until overseas commitments are met.Service A activities.13. Canadian military forces continued to carry out occupational duties in north-West Europe.14. Of the four R.C.A.F. transport squadrons operating overseas two have completed their move back to the United Kingdom from S.E.A.C., the third com-pleted its Liberator training on conversion to this type of aircraft, while thefourth, operating Dakotas in the United Kingdom and on the Continent, flew over1,400 sorties, totalling approximately 2,000 operational-hours flying.
15. No. 126 R.C.A.F. Wing of four squadrons of Spitfires participated inthe fly-past at The Hague on the 15th of the month to celebrate the liberation of holland.16. Four R.C.A.F. heavy bomber squadrons equipped with Lancasters andforming part of No. 1 Group of Bomber Command carried out a considerablenumber of sorties, while transporting troops to and from Italy.17. During the month one R.C.A.F. Mosquito Intruder Squadron, two long-range transport squadrons and one Mosquito Fighter-Bomber squadron weredisbanded.COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA.18. On the 14th September Dr. Evatt, Minister for External Affairs, in astatement said that he had been &apos;&apos; engaged in close discussion with the UnitedKingdom Government and representatives of other Governments in London witha view to the effective association of Australia with the activities of the Councilof Foreign Ministers. The Australian Government is intent on making its con-tributions to a just and lasting peace, which will render impossible any furtherresurgence of fascism. For this purpose the Australian Government believedthat it was essential to adopt a fair and democratic method of arriving atcovenants of peace. Therefore, Australia has consistently urged that thosecountries, other than the five represented on the Council, which have been active and principal belligerents in the war against the Axis Powers, have a just claimto be closely associated with the work of the Council. These belligerent countries are not many in number, but they obviously include Australia as well as Canada,New Zealand and South Africa.&quot; Dr. Evatt, in concluding his statement, saidthat the principles stated above have received the endorsement and active supportof the United Kingdom Government, and that it was hoped that these principleswould be recognised by the Council and that a satisfactory procedure would beadopted.19. Introducing the Budget for 1945-46, the Prime Minister and Treasurersaid that for the six years ended the 30th June, 1945, the total expenditure forwar and civil purposes had reached  2,790,000,000, of which sum approximately one-half had been met from revenue. Mr. Chifley said that, although there appeared to be no case for an immediate reduction in taxation at the present time,if no relief was granted now, national production might suffer because of theharmful effects of high taxation on incentive. The Commonwealth Governmenthad, therefore, decided to reduce taxation by 12-J per cent. To meet the cost of social services, a social service contribution, which would be entirely separate from the ordinary income, would be levied at a maximum rate of Is. Qd. in the  on present taxable incomes. Provision would also be made to raise the exemption for taxpayers without dependents from  104 to  200 a year.20. The demobilisation of the Australian forces will be slow until October,mounting steadily through November, and be in full flow by the New Year. the target is 3,000 to 4,000 discharges daily. While awaiting discharge, servicemenwould be released to their homes on leave : service pay would continue, and men could take employment if they wished.21. It is estimated that between 60,000 and 100,000 Australian troops maybe needed for garrison duties in Pacific areas for several months after the surrender of Japan. Areas in which the Australian Government believe these commitments may be necessary are Nauru, Solomons, Singapore, New Guinea andprobably Timor, in addition to the Tokyo occupational force. Particular import-ance is attached by the Commonwealth Government to the occupancy of Timor,because it is regarded as a vital link in the Australian defence system.22. During the transition stage from war to peace production, the Common-wealth Government will make a special allowance to men who become unemployedof  2 10s. per week for married men, plus an allowance for each dependent child,and  1 10s. per week for single men. The allowance will be made for a maximum period of six weeks, and will not be additional to payments under the unemployedbenefit scheme.23. Coal strikes have continued and it has now become necessary to rationelectricity, and railway services have had to be curtailed.   The Prime Minister is
reported as having stated that Australian coal mines would not be nationalised, asnothing would be gained by such a step.i . 24. With the signing of the surrender in Tokyo, the way became open forLieut.-General Sturdee, of the First Australian Army, to meet the Commander-in-chief of the Japanese Eighth Army for the forma! surrender, in Rabaulharbour, of the Japanese forces in the Islands north of Australia, estimated tonumber 80,000.25. The Australian House of Representatives unanimously ratified theUnited Nations Charter on the 7th September.26. The retirement of the Right Honourable S. M. Bruce from office as HighCommissioner for the Commonwealth in London, after twelve years&apos; service inthis capacity, led the Prime Minister, Mr. Chifley, to pay a tribute to the splendidservice which Mr. Bruce had rendered to his country. &quot; He has served all(Australian) Governments with distinction to himself and with great advantage to the Commonwealth.&quot;27. Colonel J. K. Murray, of Queensland, has been appointed Administratorof the Provisional Administration of the combined territories of Papua and new guinea.  He will take up his new duties during October.28. Mr. Cheng Ye-tung presented his credentials as Chinese Minister to theCommonwealth on the 10th September.Service Activities.29. The Ninth Australian Division in British North Borneo with Brigadesat Kuala-Delait, Beaufort and Tarrakan carried out occupational duties duringthe month in these areas, and has concentrated and disarmed some 5,000 Japaneseat Kuching and some 10,000 at Jesselton.30. The Seventh Australian Division had two Brigades in Dutch Borneowhere some 10,000 Japanese were being concentrated in the Balikpapan area,while the third Brigade was operating at Makassar in the Celebes with a detachment at Menado.31. The First Tactical Air Force of the R.A.A.F. had some twentysquadrons operating in support of the Land Forces from airfields on Labuan,Tarrakan and Morotai Islands.New Zealand.32. The announcement that Lieutenant-General Sir Bernard Freyberg, Y.C..is to be the next Governor-General of New Zealand has received a special welcomein New Zealand because of his close association with the Dominion in his youth,and his able leadership of the Second New Zealand Division.33. A report by Dr. Davidson, of the Ministry of Labour, on factory eon-ditions in New Zealand, contains severe criticisms of working conditions in NewZealand. The New Zealand public, which found pride in its country being amongthe foremost nations of the world in its social services, is perturbed to find NewZealand out of date in this particular aspect of social welfare.34. A Bill for the setting up of a special department to organise full employ-ment in the Dominion has been introduced in the House of Representatives.85. Returning iNew Zealand troops recently criticised the crowded accommo-dation on the s.s. Orion, complaining in particular of inadequate ventilation, rnono-tonous provisions, and lack of recreational and other facilities on the long voyage.Speaking in the House of Representatives on this matter, the Prime ministers aid that representations had been made to the United Kingdom authoritiesurging that the accommodation grievances should be rectified and that special consideration should be given to New Zealand troops in view of the long journey.Economic.36. The New Zealand Government announced on the 31st August that the cut iu the sugar ration made last March would be restored as from the 1st October,the weekly rate per person reverting from ten ounces to the former level of twelveounces. From the same date scale rates to collective consumers and allocations to manufacturers would be restored to the pre-March level, while 3 lb. of sugara person for marmalade making would be released on the 24th September.
37. In view of the tendency elsewhere, including both the United Kingdomand North America, towards still further reductions in sugar consumption in thelight of the difficult supply position, the hope has been expressed informally tothe New Zealand authorities that the increase will continue only for a limited period. They have explained, however, that the twelve ounce ration is coveredby the 1945 allocations for New Zealand agreed to by the London Food Counciland the Combined Food Board, and that the reduction to ten ounces was made only as a temporary precaution, in case the whole agreed 1945 allocation shouldnot in practice be shipped to New Zealand; moreover they feel that having regardto the larger ration enjoyed by Australia, it would be politically most difficult for them to reduce the ration below the present twelve ounce level.Service Activities.38. The Second New Zaland Division continued to carry out occupationalduties in Italy during the month of September.39. The R.N.Z.A.F., had twelve squadrons operating in the South andSouth-West Pacific areas during the month, comprising seven Fighter squadronsequipped with Corsairs, two Ventura Bomber Reconnaissance squadrons, twoDakota squadrons and one Flying Boat squadron equipped with Catalinas.UNION OF SOUTH AFRICA.40. At a civic banquet given in his honour, at Johannesburg, the PrimeMinister, Field-Marshal Smuts, paid a tribute to the heroic endurance of theBritish people, and said that next to that he regarded Lend-Lease as one ofthe finest things of the war. Its termination would not rupture the greatpartnership which had been built up between the United States and the BritishCommonwealth. Of South African affairs, the Prime Minister said that theyhad overcome greater difficulties than repatriation, education, health, and housing,and they had good grounds for looking to the future with confidence and courage.41. A Bye-election in the Kimberley district has resulted in a gain forthe Nationalist Party at the expense of the United Party, and is regarded by theOpposition as a sign that the tide is flowing against the Government, taking intoaccount the recent Nationalist gains at Wakkerstroom and at Zoutpansberg.42. Speaking at Bloemfontein, the Minister of Economic Development,Mr. S. F. Waterson, declared that South Africa was entering a period of intensiveeconomic activity and development. He was in agreement with the move toplace new industries in the central South African region, the zone south of theVaal River, which is at present only an agricultural area.43. The Union Government has agreed to extend reinstatement benefits toall Union nationals who served in the Forces of Allied Governments, provided they return to the Union within a reasonable period after their discharge fromthe forces.44. Mr. F. C. Sturrock, Minister of Transport, presiding at the SouthernAfrican Air Transport Council, announced that the trunk service between SouthAfrica and the United Kingdom would start about the middle of November,one York airplane operating each way.45. Official figures show that 60,000 Union troops are still awaiting repatria-tion. Of this total nearly 44,000 are Europeans. 40,000 Italian prisioners ofwar are still in the Union awaiting ships to take them home.46. In the Report issued by the Social and Economic Planning Council, anincrease of 2 million in the urban population of the Union is anticipated withinthe next ten years. The report urges the creation of new towns in order to avoid the further concentration of industry in the few existing centres.47. Following rioting which broke out at the Congress in Johannesburg ofthe Nationalist Party, when over a hundred persons were injured, the Partyformed &quot; combat teams &quot; as a protection against their opponents. Dr. O. Steyii,Minister of Justice, lias since given a warning that the Government will not tolerate the formation of anything in the nature of private armies.48. A new political party, to be known as the 11 National &quot;Party &quot; (asdistin ce from Dr. I). F. Mai an&apos;8 official &quot;Reunited National Party&quot;), has been
formed in Johannesburg. It is unlikely to make progress in view of its pro-gramme, which is directed at the severe repression and complete segregation ofthe natives.49. The name of the new Zulu King was announced by the Minister of native Affairs at a huge gathering of Zulus at Nongoma. Of the three rivalclaimants, the choice has fallen on Cyprian, the eldest son of the late King.All the claimants were children of three of King Solomon Dinizuhrs forty-sevenwives. Since 1933 the Zulu nation has been ruled bv the late Kin2&apos;&apos;s brotheras Regent.Service A ciivities.50. The Sixth South African Armoured Division continued to carry outoccupational duties in Italy.51. According to the latest co-ordinated reports, five S.A.A.F., bomber squadrons were still stationed in the Central Mediterranean during the month,with the two Liberator squadrons based on Celone and the three Maraudersquadrons at Rivolto.52. Four fighter squadrons of the S.A.A.F., were still in the central mediterranean, while one photographic reconnaissance squadron equipped withMosquitos and two Dakota transport squadrons were also in this theatre.53. In the Middle East there were still two general reconnaissance squadronsstationed at Gianaclis near Alexandria, of which one was clue to return to theUnion by the end of the month.54. The S.A.A.F., Flying-boat squadron was still operational under AirCommand South-East Asia, and was based at Durban.EIRE.55. Six of the escaped German service internees (see paragraph 63 of previous Report) have been recaptured and handed over to the United kingdom military authorities.56. Following public complaints on both sides of the Channel at thedifficulties and delays experienced by travellers at Holyhead, it has been decidedto abolish embarkation and landing cards for travel between Great Britain andEire..57. Arrangements have been made by the Eire authorities with Trans-Continental and Western Airways for the use of Rineanna airport as a landingstage in a new air service which is being opened between the United States.Ireland and other countries.INDIA.Report by tie Secretary of State for India.Political.58.. The chief political event of September was the announcement on the19th. September of the intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government in regard to the preparations to be made for further constitutional advance in India. Theannouncement was made in. a broadcast by the Viceroy a few days after his return from consultations with Flis Majesty:&apos;s Government in London, and later in thesame day by the Prime Minister broadcasting from London. On the whole theannouncement had a not unfavourable press in India, but no word of welcomecame from the leading political parties. The Congress spokesmen denounced thestatement as vague and unsatisfactory; it is plain that the party were deeplydisappointed that uo immediate change in the present Administration was contemplated. Mr. Jinnalrs reaction, was a demand for the full acceptance of pakistan^59. The All India Congress Committee met this month for the first time since the events of 1942. The proceedings revealed no tendency to go back onthe-policy of the &quot; Quit India *&apos; resolution of August 1942: on the contrary, tbenational and international objectives laid down in the resolution were endorsed,the demand for independence was reiterated and His Majesty&apos;s Government&quot;s
declaration of policy condemned as inadequate. Speakers voiced the determina-tion of Congress to have no dealings with the Moslem League. The general policyof Congress in pressing their demand for independence was shown to be&quot; negotiation and settlement when possible, non-co-operation and direct actionwhen necessary.&quot; Tears that Congress might boycott the coming elections werenot realised; Congressmen were given a mandate to fight the elections as a demonstration of the will of the people for an immediate transfer of power.60. Preparations for the elections are now absorbing the attention of all parties. Election manifestos have yet to be issued, but it is plain that Congresswill fight on the issue of independence here and now. while the Moslem Leaguewill take their stand on the demand for Pakistan and try to establish their claimto be the only organisation truly representative of Moslem interests.61. The prolonged freedom from serious communal disturbances whichmarked the war years was broken on the 26th September when for reasons stillobscure communal rioting broke out in Bombay. The city was still unsettled atthe end of the month, when the death roll had risen to 28, with a larger numberof injured still in hospital.Indian States.62. On the 28th and 29th September the Viceroy met a deputation of theStanding Committee of the Chamber of Princes, which has been reconstitutedafter remaining in abeyance since the resignation of its members nine months ago. The meeting appears to have been friendly, and it may be assumed thatnormal relations with the Chamber have now been restored.Frontier and Foreign Relations.North-West Frontier.63. Shortage of grain is causing the political authorities considerableconcern, but there have been no serious repercussions among the inhabitants yet.Afghanistan.64. The tribal situation in the Kunar area unproved somewhat, and theAfghan request for air action by the Royal Air Force has been withdrawn.Warning notices had been dropped from the air in the usual manner but there hasbeen no bombing. At the end of the month, however, the Safis had not submittedand the attitude of the Mohmancl tribesmen was still uncertain.65. Fortunately for the Afghan Government, their Southern provinceremained quiet in spite of the appearance of a distant and junior relative of theRoyal family at the headquarters of the refugee Zadran rebel Mazrak on the borders of Waziristan.66. The staff of the former German Legation left Afghanistan for Germanyvia the Soviet Union. Nothing had been heard of them since they crossed theEusso-Afghan frontier.67. On the insistence of the British, American, Russian, Chinese and french representatives in Kabul, the Japanese Minister agreed to seal his archives andfunds. The Legation is still regarded as being in official relations with theAfghan Government, but the representatives of the five Powers have now raised with their Governments the question of its liquidation.Sinkiang.68. A well-armed bandit force crossed the Sino-Soviet frontier in the southand caused a panic in Kashgar, but was later, according to the Chinese account,routed in a battle at Yangi Hissar about half-way between Kashgar and Yarkand.Further north Turki rebels, based on Hi, advanced almost to the gates of Urumchi;according to a Chinese report, they were supported by tanks and aircraft.Latest reports indicate that both sides had agreed to accept the mediation of theSoviet consular authorities in the Province.Nepal.69. Arrangements have been made for the Nepalese contingent which servedwith the Indian army to return to Nepal with their full equipment.
Council of Foreign Ministers.70. The Government of India appointed Sir Geoffrey Prior, political resident in the Persian Gulf, to represent their views at meetings of the Council.A written statement of the Government of India&apos;s views on Reparations and onthe future of the Italian Colonies in Africa was submitted to the Council bySir G. Prior.United Nations Organisation.71. Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar will be Indian delegate to the PreparatoryCommission and Leader of the Indian delegation to the first session of the general assembly.Economic.72. Food. The food situation in Bengal is causing &quot;anxiety. weather conditions have been such that it is practically certain that the main rice crop ofthe Province, harvested round Christmas 1945, will be short. No exact calculationis possible, but it seems unlikely that the outturn of the Autumn and Winter ricecrops together can be better than 20 to 25 per cent, (say 2 million tons) belowaverage. There is no surplus of rice in sight in other parts of India nearlysufficient to fill this gap, nor are imported rice supplies of this order in prospectfrom Burma and the Far East, while the substitution of other grains is not acceptable to the rice-eating people of the Province.73. On the other hand there are over half a million tons of rice stocks in thehands of the Bengal Government, and some part of last year&apos;s winter crop, aswell as this year&apos;s autumn harvest, is in the hands of the cultivator. By com-parison with the famine year, statistical supplies may be of the same order, butthere are other conditions which justify the view that the over-all position isvery much better than it was in 1943. In particular, Calcutta and other townsare effectively rationed; there is a great improvement in transport road, rail and river and in the storage position in Bengal; the administrative machinery,Central as well as Provincial, is greatly improved; and India is in receipt ofimports of wheat arranged by His Majesty&apos;s Government at the rate of100,000 tons a month.74. The essential need is for the maintenance of confidence without whichprices will rise and stocks be held up in a way which must bring the non-culti-vating classes of Bengal once again into grave danger. Imports on a small scalefrom Burma have already begun and the Central Government have promised, asin 1944, to find, if necessary, supplies equivalent to what is required to feed&apos;Calcutta, an area of over 4 million souls. Meanwhile the Ministry of Food are pressing the needs of India on the Combined Food Board in Washington. Whilethe position is one of anxiety and requires constant vigilance, no unduly possibility-mistic view need be taken.75. Fiscal Policy. The Government of India are contemplating the settingup of a Tariff Board, for two years in the first instance, to investigate claims to assistance and protection during the transition period from war to peace fromindustries established or developed in war-time or in respect of which an assurance of post-war protection has been given. The initial list of industries to be referredto the Board is : Non-ferrous metals including antimony; grinding wheels; causticsoda and bleaching powder; sodium thiosulphate, sodium sulphite, anhydroussodium bisulphite; phosphates and phosphoric acid; butter colour aerated waterpowder colour; rubber manufactures; fire hose; wood screws; steel hoops forbaling; bichromates; calcium chloride; starch; aluminium. In respect of these industries the Board would be asked to report whether the industry in questionis on sound business lines and whether it is either likely within a reasonable timeto carry on successfully without assistance, or ought to be protected in the national interest and can be so protected without undue cost to the community. where these conditions are satisfied, the Board would recommend protective duties with additional or alternative measures if necessary for a period not exceeding threeyears.  The Board is to give due weight to consumer interests:Service A activities.Military.76. During the month there was continuous activity in all countries which came under S.E.A.C.   Arrangements for the occupation of these countries and
for the surrender and disarmament of the Japanese forces were put in train.This involved the movement of considerable numbers of Imperial troops by air and sea.77. Burma. Once contact had been made with the Japanese forces theirdisarmament and concentration proceeded smoothly. A number of. disarmedJapanese were employed on labour duties in the Mikpalin quarries and at theSittang docks. Some sporadic attacks on villages continued to be made byDacoits.78. Siam. Imperial troops were flown to Bangkok area early in the month.The disarmament of the Japanese and the concentration of dumps proceeded onthe whole smoothly. Some minor clashes between Siamese and Chinese occurred in which there were a few casualties.79. Malaya. The occupation proceeded smoothly and according to plan.Our troops were landed at Penang and Singapore and contact between them was established.  No incidents were reported.80. French Indo-China. The fly-in of our troops in the first half of themonth was slightly delayed by adverse weather, but by the middle of september the Commission to Japanese Southern Army Headquarters at Saigon was fullyfunctioning. Trouble broke out between Annamites and the French and thesituation deteriorated. Attacks in strength were made by Annamites on thePower House and Commissariat in Saigon but were repulsed. Imperial troopsrelieved the French on most of the important buildings. The build-up of our troops continued, and some Japanese troops were employed for enforcing lawand order. At the end of the month Saigon on the whole was quiet, but thesituation remained tense.81. Java.-The situation remained difficult and food shortage was acute.The first British troops arrived in Batavia on the 29th September.82. Sumatra. Japanese forces were continuing to try and maintain lawand order and to protect Allied parties in spite of increasing difficulties. Thefood situation in cities was acute.83. In the early part of the month the main tasks of the Allied Air forces were supply and leaflet dropping. The leaflets gave detailed instructions for theconduct of the Japanese and the native populations, and the organisation to beundertaken by Allied prisoners of war preparatory to their release, Red Crossteams with doctors, medical supplies and food were dropped on prisoner-of-warcamps. Public Relations Officers and teams of administrative personnel were dropped in Malaya, Siam and Saigon. Later troops and supplies were flown into Siam and Indo-China and large numbers of prisoners-of-war and internees84. D.D.T. Spraying. It is proposed to spray D.D.T. from the air onSingapore, an area of 34 square miles, as soon as possible.85. Morale. Eelease and repatriation continued to pre-occupy the thoughts of British troops. To begin with, most men were extremely optimistic but the prompt warning of shortage of shipping had a steadying influence. nevertheless there was a very widespread belief that release and repatriation would be con-siderably faster. Consequently the announcement that Group 23 would be released in the period December 1945-January 1946, came as a shock and a serious blow.86. Those likely to be repatriated were more resigned than those relying on release, though, when they realised that it would be impossible for some months to hit the target of three years and four months, many of them felt that they hadbeen badly misled.87. It would appear that, while many give their rea&apos;sons for demandingearly release as the fear that others may get the best jobs, the present outcry ischiefly emotional and based mainly on the intense desire to get out of the army as soon as possible.88. Recovered Prisoners of War and Internees. Up to midnight, the26th September, the following numbers had been evacuated : Air.were evacuated.General.To IndiaTo United kingdom to Australia20,00014,5006,057
BURMA.89. Perhaps the most important event of the month was the agreement reached at Kandy on the 7th September between S.A.C.S.E.A. and representa-tives of the Government of Burma on the one hand and Aung San and hiscolleagues on the other regarding the amalgamation of the Patriot Burma forces and. the Burma Army. The meeting produced satisfactory results, and Aung Sanconcluded by saying : &quot; I venture to say that this has paved the way, not only fora happy present, but also for a happy future that lies ahead.&quot;90. This agreement, however, represented a departure from the demandsrepeatedly stated in Burma, and particularly at a mass meeting of the Anti-Fascist Peoples Independence League held in Rangoon on the 19th August, thatthe P.B.F. should form the nucleus of the new Burma Army and any otherelement be absorbed into it. A criticism has already been heard from certain quarters in Burma, reflecting on Aung San himself, that the agreement reached atKandy may not satisfy these demands. It is thus possible that, no matter how farAung San himself justified the confidence which has been placed in him, he maynot find it altogether easy to implement his side of the bargain.91. The power of the A F.P.I.L., backed as it is by the P.B.F., seems to haveshown a marked increase since the practical end of hostilities deprived the P.B.F.of more active and proper employment.. The arms behind the A.F.P.I.L. enable it to exercise very considerable pressure on all political groups in Burma, so muchso that it seems to be tending to strangle a normal free political development. Theattitude of the public towards the A.F.P.I.L. and the P.B.F. is generally one ofcaution and fear. Since the mass meeting on the 19th August the A.F.P.I.L. hasconcentrated on consolidating its position, improving its organisation and settingup committees to consider reconstruction, finance and constitutional matters.92. To the many political parties which have been emerging must now beadded Dr. Ba Maw&apos;s old party, the Sinyetha. In addition, several labour organisations are starting to function once more.93. Though Dacoits are still at large, the situation has improved. Gangsare being broken up by the police and some progress has been made in the round-ing-up of firearms. In some areas the P.B.F. have co-operated. But the quantitiesof arms which are believed to have been hidden away still give grounds for considerable anxiety. The concentration and disarmament of the Japanese whoare still in Burma at the end of hostilities (particularly along the Tenasserimcoast) has been proceeding slowly but quietly.94. An indication of a more peaceful atmosphere is the interest being takenin education. Emergency university classes have been begun in Rangoon. Pro-visional selection of fifteen State scholars to study in the United Kingdom hasalready been made. Postal services are being revived and at the end of Augustforty post offices had been opened. The civil broadcasting station in Rangoon isnow in working order, but its influence is curtailed by the relatively small numberof receivers in operation. If is, however, part of the plans of the Public RelationsDepartment of the Government of Burma recently approved to set on foot ascheme of village receivers.  The procuring of these is in hand.THE COLONIAL EMPIRE.Report by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.(Note. -In this report &quot; Colonies &quot; is used to cover not only the Colonies inthe restricted sense, but also Protectorates and Mandated Territories,and &apos;&apos; Colonial Governors &apos;&apos; is used to include High Commissioners andthe British Resident, Zanzibar.)Economic Affairs.Food Supplies.Ceylon.95. Tea and Rubber Marketing. Mr. D. S. Senanayake took advantage ofhis recent visit to this country to discuss with the Ministry of Food and theMinistry of Supply the question of future bulk purchases of Ceylon tea andrubber.
96. On the former commodity he received an assurance that His Majesty&apos;sGovernment would consult with the present participants in the bulk purchasescheme with the object of extending the existing arrangements during 1946 andpossibly for such longer period as might be necessary. The Ministry of Supplyagreed to extend their present price for Ceylon rubber to the end of September1946 on the understanding that discussions would take place in the Spring of nextyear as to the price after that date.Palestine.97. Citrus Delegation.-A joint Jewish/Arab Delegation representing thecitrus growers of Palestine is visiting this country to discuss with the depart-ments concerned the sale of part of this year&apos;s crop to the United Kingdom and long-term problems of the Palestine citrus industry. The Delegation are alsoexploring the possibilities of new markets on the Continent for Palestine citrusfruit.Jamaica.98.   Bananas. Arrangements are in hand for the resumption at the begin-ning of 1946 of shipments of bananas from Jamaica to this country.Defence.Ocean Island.99. Arrangements have been made for an Australian Force Commander toaccept surrender of the Japanese on Ocean Island, the capital of the Gilbert andEllice Islands Colony, on behalf of the United States Theatre Commander. TheForce Commander will be accompanied by representatives of the British Phos-phate Commissioners and by the Resident Commissioner, Gilbert and ElliceIslands, together with staff already designated for work on the Island. Thisparty will proceed to Ocean Island from Nauru where the Japanese surrenderedon the 13th September.Japanese prisoners in the British Solomon Islands Protectorate.100. Arrangements have been made for the transfer of the 26,000 Japaneseprisoners of war on Bougainville in the Australian Solomons to the BritishSolomon Islands Protectorate. The move is necessary because Bougainville is extremely malarious and extensive precautions would have to be taken to protect the Japanese from the vengeance of the natives of the area. It was at first pro-posed to move the prisoners to Shortland Island but, at the request of the HighCommissioner, Western Pacific, this proposal was abandoned; it would havemeant that all native inhabitants of Shortland would have had to have been removed. It has now been agreed that the Japanese should be sent to uninhabitedislands of the Fauro group in Bougainville Strait, east of Shortland Island.Demobilisation of members of Colonial Volunteer Defence Forces evacuated fromJapanese Prison Camps in Hong Kong and Malaya.101. About 3,000 British members of the local Hong Kong and MalayanVolunteer Defence Forces are expected to arrive shortly in the United kingdom for demobilisation after their release from Japanese prison camps. Control ofthe Far Eastern Volunteer Forces is exercised by the Colonial Office as, unlike the majority of local forces in the colonies, they were not taken over by the ArmyCouncil.102. Arrangements have been made with the War Office for these volunteers to be repatriated to this country through normal military channels and to receivesimilar treatment to British Army ex-prisoners of war from the Far East duringthe voyage and on reception at ports of disembarkation. Thereafter, unless in need of hospital treatment, they will proceed to their homes for the leave due tothem. The period of leave and the terminal release benefits they will receivewill be similar to those for British Army personnel but their demobilisation willbe carried out under Colonial Office arrangements.Report on Individual Colonies.Palestine.103. The confidence, expressed by Jewish leaders during the early part ofthe month in the imminence of a favourable decision on the Palestine issue by
His Majesty&apos;s Government was reinforced later by President Truman&apos;s reportedsupport of a Jewish Agency demand for 100,000 immigration certificates.Latterly, optimism gave way suddenly to a state bordering on panic in JewisiiAgency circles, engendered by a series of reports by Reuters to the effect thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government intended substantially to maintain the 1939 white paper.104. Public reaction among the Jews was reserved but bewildered. Con-fidence is widely voiced that, whatever decision His Majesty&apos;s Government may take, displaced Jews from devastated Europe will continue to find their way to palestine in substantial numbers.105. Arab reactions to President Truman&apos;s support of the demand for100,000 certificates were naturally unfavourable. Apprehension was somewhatallayed by confidence in the active interest of Arab Governments and the league in the Palestine question, and by the belief that Anglo-American interest in middle East oil precluded a policy likely to antagonise Arabs.106. Tewfik Es Suweidi, Chairman of the Arab League EconomicCommittee, visited Palestine and indicated that an attempt to bring Arab political leaders together would be made by invitations to a League meeting in October, todiscuss the organisation of Arab Offices and land redemption.107. The arrival of 1,300 Mauritius detainees, on admission to Palestine asimmigrants, was hailed by the Jews as belated reparation of injustice, but satis-faction was tempered by widespread criticism of the inadequacy of arrangementsmade by Jewish authorities for their reception.108. On the 2nd September 7 armed Jews dressed as British Police entered the Palestine Discount Bank in Tel Aviv, searched the premises, after holding upthe employees, but failed to find the safe keys and were unable to remove anythingof value. On the same day an unknown person broke into a textile firm&apos;s premises in Tel Aviv and stole textiles to the value of  P. 5,500. Both actions are attri-buted to the desire of the Irgun Zvai Leumi to collect funds. A British Con-stable, escorting Post Office salaries, was mortally wounded in Tel Aviv on the28th September. The money was saved. There were 224 anti-terrorist raidsin the course of the month, resulting in the detention of 60 persons. The totainumber detained on the 21st September was 437.Trans-Jordan.109. Excitement caused by the resignation of two Ministers on account ofthe registration of a Jewish Company has died down following the enactment ofa law rendering the registration invalid.110. Visits have been paid during the month to His Highness the AmirAbdullah by Syrian monarchists, among whom were members of the influentialBakri family.Malta.111. The Governor broadcast on the 31st August a statement embodying the results of his recent consultation in London. He suggested that a commissioner should be invited to visit Malta to advise on the framing of thenew constitution; and stated that, meanwhile, it would be necessary to proceedto a general election under the 1939 constitution.Ceylon.112. Mr. D. S. Senanayake, Vice-Chairman of the Board of ministers and Leader of the State Council, left England by air for Ceylon on the20th September after the conclusion of his discussions with the Secretary ofState.West Indies.113. The Report of the West India Royal Commission was published onthe 4th October in accordance with the approval given by the War Cabinetsome months ago. The delay in publication was due to the necessity for sending out copies of the report to the various colonies concerned so that they couldbe available there for simultaneous publication. In addition to the main reportof the Royal Commission there were published as a companion volume the
report by Professor (now Sir Frank) Engledow, on Agriculture, &amp;c, a white paper recording what steps have been taken so far to carry out the recommenda-tions of the Royal Commission Report, and the Report of the Comptroller for development and Welfare for the years 1943-44.British Guiana.114. In 1944 a local Franchise Commission presented their reportrecommending various changes in the qualifications for membership of Legisla-tive Council and for the franchise in the colony. The majority of theCommission recommended a reduction in the franchise which, however, fell short of universal suffrage, while a minority recommended universal adult suffrage.My predecessor decided that the majority report should be accepted.115. The necessary legislation to carry out this decision has been introduced into the Legislative Council of British Guiana and has recentlycalled forth protests from certain East Indian bodies in the Colony and thedemand that universal adult suffrage should be introduced forthwith. these claims were not supported by the inhabitants of African descent. After con-sultation with the Governor I authorised him to make a statement upholdingthe 1944 decision but stating that, provided the new Legislative Council elected on the basis of the extended franchise worked successfully, and the LegislativeCouncil itself, or some representative commission appointed by the Governor,voted in favour of universal adult suffrage in five years&apos; time, I should then beprepared to give sympathetic consideration to it.^Colonial Service,&apos;Recruitment.116. Although recruitment for the Colonial Service was resumed at thebeginning of June and is proceeding as rapidly as possible, the man-power position in the Colonial Government Services still gives cause for great anxietyand, in particular, there is a critical shortage of medical staff. Apart fromthe needs of the colonies in general, there is a very special urgency for the recruitment of all types of staff for the restored administrations in malaya and Hong Kong. The speed of recruitment is inevitably affected by the shortageof staff in the Colonial Office and, in particular, shortage of skilled clerical staff;and also, to a lesser extent, by delays in obtaining the release under Class B of selected candidates from the Forces.Aviation.British (West Indian Airways.117. Group Captain Dismore has now returned from his visit to the carribbean area. His report on British West Indian Airways is at present underconsideration in consultation with the other Departments concerned.
