THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MaJESTY18 GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.  (us) 25U.COPY NO.27TH OCTOBER,  1 9h5.CABINETWHEAT SUPPLIES FOR GERMANY AND AUSTRIAMemorandum by the Minister of Food.Since the meeting of the Cabinet on&quot;Tuesday,23rd October,  I have,  as I then undertook to do,  re-examined the wheat -position carefully with a view to making a further recommendation bo the Cabinet once. (1+5) 2h1 ,  &quot;Wheat Supplies for Germany and Austria&quot;.It is my considered judgement that to chip any morewheat to Germany and Austria before we receive assurances-from the main exporting countries that they are willingto reduce their stocks of wheat at 30th Juno, 191+.6, tolevels consistent with the International Wheat Agreementminima would endanger the supply of wheat to the UnitedKingdom and I-therefore recommend that no more wheat be shipped to Germany or Austria till such assurances aregiven.      The countries concerned are being pressed togive an early reply to our request.In the meantime I must warn my colleagues that thepurchase of wheat required for the British zone inGermany and Austria will involve spending dollars.B.
