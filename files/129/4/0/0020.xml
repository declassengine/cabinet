Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1945. 71SECRET. Copy No. 4gCP. (45) 270.6th November, 1945.CABINET.WASHINGTON FINANCIAL TALKS.Note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE financial negotiations in Washington have reached a point where a firm offer from our side would have a fair prospect of securing acceptance.2. Accordingly I&apos; would propose that the Ambassador and Lord Keynes be instructed to put the following proposal before the Americans : (a) A loan to the United Kingdom of $2-1 billion repayable over 50 years at per cent, interest, repayment beginning 5 years from now.(b) An option on a further $2 billion free of interest (and repayment as above) as backing for an offer to members of the sterling area to make their sterling as freely available for current expenditure outside thearea.or inside.3.   If the above is unobtainable, our limit is : $4 billion at 2 per cent, (with an option on a further $ 1 billion at 2 percent.), repayment as in 2 (a) above. Any improvement either in the periodof repayment, or postponement of starting date of repayment, or in the rateof interest, would, of course, be welcome.4.   We should require waivers as follows :-(a) In the event of, e.g.. a breakdown of multilateral clearing, an internationaldepression of trade, or a scarcity of dollars : postponement of any obligation to repay capital.(b) In the event of United Kingdom exports failing in any, year to reach an agreed target : complete waiving of any obligation to pay interest for that year.It would be essential that waivers should be embodied in the agreement reached in terms which cannot be altered by Congress, and that the form of thewaivers should be such that they were capable of automatic application withoutUnited States scrutiny of our affairs. Waiver (a) would be an essential part ofthe proposal in paragraph 2 above, and both waivers (a) and (b) would be essential if we were driven back on the proposal in paragraph 3.5. The following are the annual amounts involved on several assump-tions : Proposal in Paragraph 2 :If the interest on the $2-^- billion had been 1 per cent., the cost of this alternative, on a straight annuity basis, would have been $104 million.At 2 per cent., the cost is $120 million.Proposal in Paragraph 3 :Costs, on an annuity basis : -$5 billion-$159 million.$4-1 billion-$143 million.$4   billion--$127 million.[30823]
6.. We should agree to use the assistance given to us for progressive removalof discrimination, and to secure writing down of sterling balances by voluntary agreement with each creditor.7. In the event of agreement being reached with the United States adminis-tration on the lines suggested above and being put to Congress, we for our partshould be prepared to support the Americans in their proposals for&apos; an inter-national Conference as the preliminary to the setting up of an international trade Organisation. Further, we should put to Parliament acceptance of BrettonWoods. This acceptance would be accompanied by an interpretative declaration that nothing in the Final Act would require us to adopt an internal deflationarypolicy at a time of unemployment.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,Qth November, 1945.
