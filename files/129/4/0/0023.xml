Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET.Copy N**.CP. (45) 273.8th November. 1945.CABINET.AGRICULTURAL  POLICY.Memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, the Secretaryof State for Scotland, and the Secretary of State for the Home Department.WE submit for Cabinet approval the attached draft announcement on agricultural policy.2. The Lord Presidents Committee, at their meeting on the1st November, 1945,* considered a memorandum (L.P. (45) 216) in which we setout the considerations leading to the proposals contained in the draft announce-ment.   The Committee (1) Invited the Agricultural Ministers to arrange for inter-departmentalconsideration of the points raised in discussion.(2) Subject to this, authorised the Agricultural Ministers to submit the draftpublic statement to the Cabinet for approval.3. Following inter-departmental consideration, we have consulted with our colleagues on the points raised during the discussion and have made suitableamendments in the draft announcement, which is now agreed with all concerned.4. The proposed announcement is intended to be an outline of the principles on which the Governments agricultural policy will be based. It does not purportto be a comprehensive statement of all the measures which the Government deemto be necessary in order fully to attain the objective stated in the second paragraph.5. The principles are firmly based on Labour Party policy, and the proposed announcement interlocks closely with the statement on Government Controls&apos;and food Policy approved by the Cabinet on the 30th October, 1945, t and made bythe Minister of Food in the House of Commons on the 7th November, 1945.  .6. The proposals are designed to provide reasonable economic stability tothe industry; they require efficiency from the industry. The proposed system ofassured markets and guaranteed prices is sufficiently stable to give confidence to the industry; the proposed mechanism for providing those assured markets andguaranteed prices is sufficiently flexible to allow of the modifications and adjust-ments which will be required in the national interest as conditions change, both at home and abroad.7. We shall be glad to have the approval of the Cabinet to the announce-ment being made and to our entering into discussion with the representative organisations of farmers, workers and landowners to work out the details, in preparation for the necessary legislation, which we should hope to introduce earlyin the 1946-47 session.T.

AGRICULTURAL POLICY.Draft Announcement.1. I am now able to indicate in broad outline the general principles onwhich the Government&apos;s agricultural policy will be based.2. As stated in the Gracious Speech the Government will develop to thefullest possible extent the home production of good food with due regard tothe recommendations of the Conference on Food and Agriculture at Hot Springs.The objective will be to promote a healthy and efficient agriculture capable of producing that part of the nation&apos;s food which is required from home sources atthe lowest price consistent with the provision of adequate remuneration anddecent living conditions for farmers and workers, with a reasonable return on capital invested.3. To this end the Government propose to establish as an essential and permanent feature of their policy for food and agriculture a system of assuredmarkets and guaranteed prices for the principal agricultural products, namely,milk, fat livestock, eggs, cereals, potatoes and sugar beet.4. The annual price reviews instituted in February 1945 will be continued,together with the provision for special reviews in exceptional circumstances.5. After these reviews prices for cereals, potatoes and sugar beet will befixed by the Government eighteen months ahead of the harvest.6. The existing system of fixing prices for fat livestock, milk and eggs willbe developed so as to cover the period after June 1948, when the existingguarantees would otherwise cease to operate. These branches of food productionentail advance breeding and other commitments for the farmer and, in order togive the necessary continuous assurance of reasonable stability of prices, theGovernment propose to institute a new system of overlapping four-year periodswith biennial reviews. For example, in February 1946 minimum price-levels willbe considered and fixed for the two-year period ending June 1950, and in 1948for the period July 1950 to June 1952. These minimum price-levels will applyto milk, fat cattle and fat sheep, for which guaranteed minimum prices havealready been announced until June 1948, and to fat pigs and eggs. Actual prices for all these products will continue to be fixed in advance for twelve monthlyperiods after each successive February review.7. All prices-minimum and actual mill be fixed with due regard to theneed for the greatest possible efficiency and economy in methods of production.Account will be taken of any modifications in the character of the agriculturaloutput which may be necessary to meet changing national requirements. If itshould become necessary to apply a quantitative limitation to any section of theassured home market this would be announced eighteen months before the harvestin the case of crops (i.e., after a February review), and at least two years inadvance in the case of fat livestock, milk and eggs (i.e., after a biennial review).8. Thus farmers will always know the prices for cereals, potatoes and sugar beet well before the time comes for sowing those crops For.fat livestock, milk and eggs they will know minimum prices three or four years in advance, andactual prices some three to fifteen months in advance. In all cases they will begiven ample notice of any quantitative limitation which may be imposed on theassured market.: 9, The actual method of affording to the farmer an assured market and a guaranteed price will be worked out for each commodity, with due regard forthe system to be adopted by the Government for the procurement, distribution and -sale of all those foods-home-produced and imported which play animportant. part in the nation&apos;s diet. My Right Hon. Friend the Minister o&amp;Foodhas already announced that detailed plans will be worked out by the Government,in consultation with the interests concerned, to give effect to this policy. Methodsother than that, of-direct Government purchase (for example, the deficiencypayment system of the Wheat Act) will not be excluded.  .,
10. Legislation will be required to amend the statutory provisions withregard to wages regulation in the light of the war-time experience of centralwage-fixing machinery.11. As a corollary to the provision of this substantial measure of securityof markets and stability of prices the Government propose to take appropriatesteps to ensure that agricultural land is not only properly farmed but properlymanaged and equipped and to promote improved efficiency in the production,marketing and distribution of home food products. Free technical advice willbe made available to agriculturists to improve their farming efficiency. In orderto deal effectively with the minority of farmers and landowners who fail in the responsibilities attaching to the occupation and ownership of land, the Govern-ment propose to seek&quot; powers in permanent legislation to exercise certain necessary measures of control. Such farmers and landowners will be subject to a :period of supervision during which compulsory directions may be served, and in the last resort will be dispossessed if, after a reasonable period, it becomes evident thatthey are unable or unwilling to improve. There will, however, be a right to make representations to an independent tribunal before a tenancy is terminated by theMinister or an owner-occupier or landowner dispossessed.12. Systems of marketing and distribution will come under review as partof the detailed investigation announced by my Right Hon. Friend the Ministerof Food, to which reference has already been made.13. Powers will be sought to enable the Agricultural Ministers to acquire and by voluntary negotiation; or compulsorily in cases of dispossession or wherepublic ownership is the only means of securing the full productive use of the land.14. The Government propose to set up a Commission for the purpose of managing and developing for agricultural use land acquired under these powers in England and Wales.15. Local bodies will be required to assist in the execution of this policyand to provide the industry with local leadership and guidance. In Englandand Wales County Committees similar to the existing County War AgriculturalExecutive Committees will be constituted on a permanent basis. Their primaryduty will be to promote efficiency, working for this purpose in close association with the National Advisory Service which it is intended to establish in Englandand Wales on the 1st October, 1946. They will act as the local agents of theMinister in the exercise of the proposed powers of control, and undertake certainexecutive services; they will also be responsible for the schemes already inexistence for the training of ex-service men as skilled agricultural workers. Itis proposed that these Committees should continue to be appointed by the Ministerbut that they should be reconstituted to consist in part of persons selected bythe Minister from lists of names submitted by the different sections of the agri-cultural industry, and in part of a smaller number of persons selected by theMinister from other sources. It is hoped that the experience of many of thosewho have rendered such valuable service during the war will continue to beavailable under the new constitution. Members of the staff of the English and welsh Committees who possess the appropriate qualifications will have anopportunity to enter the National Advisory Service. The services of others,including many of the non-technical staff, will be required in the continuing localorganisation that will be preserved by these Committees. Somewhat different forms of local organisation will probably be found desirable in Scotland andNorthern Ireland.16. The world food shortage is extremely serious. For the time being,therefore, compulsory directions to grow sugar beet and potatoes must be servedand supervision exercised where necessary over the laying down of grass so thatthis process keeps in step with the anticipated increase in livestock, with therequirements of home-grown feeding-stuffs, and&apos;with the continued need for alarge tillage acreage. As the world shortage of food passes, the government intend to leave farmers normally to grow the crops which their experience,supplemented by guidance from the Advisory Services, indicates are most suited to their own land. They intend, however, to seek permanent powers to servecompulsory directions on any farmer whenever necessary in the national interest,but these powers will normally be used only in exercising control over farms under
- supervision or to supplement the methods of steering production already described, should an overriding need in national food supplies or national dietrender this necessary.17. The controls exercised over the distribution of fertilisers, feeding-stuffs,machinery and other farm material will be lifted or modified when supplies are sufficient to ensure free and equitable distribution. ...&quot;18. This outline of the Governments plans for a gradual transition fromthe organisation and methods necessary to promote maximum food productionin war-time to a permanent policy appropriate to more stable conditions) will need to be worked out in detail with a view to the submission of legislationproposals to Parliament. This will be done in full consultation with the organisations representative of landowners, farmers and workers. The Govern-ment hope that with this assurance of their intentions all sections of the industry will attack their immediate tasks with enthusiasm and confidence.
