THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1945. ,        113SECRET. Copy No.    0&quot;CP. (45) 288.16th November, 1945.CABINET.LABOUR CONTROLS.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.AT the meeting of the Cabinet on the 1st November (CM. (45) 48thConclusions, Minute 6) it was agreed that, for the time being, no change shouldbe made in the existing system of labour controls. At the same time the lord president was invited to arrange for the problem to be further examined in thelight of the points which had been raised in the course of the discussion. Thepoints which were raised have since been examined, and I now recommend thatwe should maintain the present system of controls subject to the followingchanges : Essential Work Orders.(1) Departments should review the industries and firms covered by theEssential Work Orders and other similar Orders which tie a workerto his job up to the age of 65 for men and 60 for women.(2) We should consider sympathetically on their individual merits applica-tions from workers over 30 years of age to be allowed to leave their war-time job and return to their former employment if it is of value to the community.Directions.(3) We should not hesitate to use the power of direction in respect of menand women under 30 years of age for the purpose of expanding thelabour force of certain important industries and services.(4) We should confine the use of directions over the age of 30 to meet thespecial needs of industries such as building, coalmining and to nurses,and to such others as may be approved.Control of Engagement Order.(5) We should lower the age to 30 for both men and women with the require-ment that labour should be engaged only through an employment exchange or other approved agency. This should be subject tosafeguards for the building industry in which control over particularjobs to which the workers go is of special importance. This may benecessary in one or two other industries where similar conditionsapply. These safeguards will be worked out in consultation with theDepartments concerned and with both sides of the industry.2. With these changes we should embark upon a policy of strict enforcement of the controls including prosecution where necessary.3. After examining the points raised in the discussion on the 1st November,I am satisfied that we are most likely to be able to meet the labour needs ofimportant civilian industries if we take steps to operate controls more fully butover a more limited field and to enforce them, instead of retaining the existing system without full enforcement and relying upon a public campaign in favourof full control.   Even if such a campaign were successful and its success is[30902]
extremely doubtful at could not give results for some considerable time. Mean-while every week that goes by without a clear statement of policy encourages both employers and workers to ignore the law. This lowers the prestige and efficiency of &quot;the Employment Exchanges and makes it more difficult for them to meet urgentlabour demands.4. I believe, moreover, that we should have public support for themaintenance and enforcement of controls broadly up to the call-up age of 30.I do not think we are likely to succeed in a campaign which was directed tomaintain labour controls for men and women over the age of 30, particularly as the labour becoming available in the next few months will consist largely of ex-service men and women released in Class A.5. The rate of demobilisation has increased and the Services are keepingwell up to their programme. It is estimated that in the second half of 1945there will be a total increase of 2,300,000 in the numbers in employment in homecivilian industries and services and the export trade. As these larger numberstake employment the need for labour controls will diminish. There are,however, a limited number of industries to which recruitment will still present difficulty. These are industries in which improvements are urgently needed asregards physical conditions and possibly also as regards wages and terms ofemployment. I am arranging for the Factory Inspectorate to give special attention to these industries so as to stimulate the remedying of defects dueto war-time difficulties in obtaining labour and materials, not only for improve-ments, but even for maintenance up to pre-war conditions. If the improvementsare to be made it will, however, be necessary to see that labour and materials are made available to the factory employer or a contractor and the work mayhave to be given some degree of preference.6. I am also examining the level of wages and earnings in these unpopularindustries with a view to seeing whether the existing standard of wages and terms of employment are such as to act as a deterrent to recruitment. In appro-priate cases I propose to arrange with the Minister responsible for the production to take up with both sides of the industry the need for a review of practicableimprovements so that labour may be attracted into the employment. Duringthe war this problem had to be tackled on similar lines as it was recognised that even with full public support for labour controls it was unreasonable to tieworkers to employment which did not offer reasonable standards.7. The industries which are unpopular have certain features in common.For example, many of them involve shift work, fairly hard physical work, some-times in rough and perhaps dirty conditions, and work out of doors. they include, for example, slaughtering; fell mongering and tanning; glass bottles;jute, sack and bag manufacture and repair; concrete products including spunpipes; asbestos cement; stoneware pipes; asphalt and roofing felt. The total numbers employed in these industries is a small percentage of the total and Iam convinced that the solution of their labour supply problem can best be found by examination of the conditions in each industry with the employers and theworkers&apos; organisation, and not by the extended use of compulsory powers of direction by officers in the Employment Exchanges.8. If my proposals are accepted we should consider how we can bestarrange a campaign explaining to the public the need for retaining some labour controls. This campaign should be related to the general man-power positionand to Government plans for industry generally, including economic controls.G. A.
