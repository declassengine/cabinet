&apos;fH3!jP,QCUMENT 18 THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 261.mh October, 1945.CABINET.UNITED STATES REQUEST FOR BASES IN ICELANDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate to my colleagues the annexed memorandum, prepared in theForeign Office, outlining the developments that have taken place since the UnitedStates Government informed us of their intention to secure a long-term lease of bases in Iceland.. 2. &quot; It will be seen that the United States Government have decided notto adopt the alternative proposal, which I put to Mr. Byrnes, that they might ask the Icelandic Government for a lease of the bases in question for a limited period, as a temporary measure pending the coming into force of- the securityprovisions of the United Nations Charter (particularly Article 43) and the admission of Iceland to the United Nations Organisation. (Under Article 43agreements for base facilities are to be negotiated on the initiative of the security council and between the Security Council and Members or groups of Members :there is no provision for such negotiations to take place between one nation andanother.)3. As the Icelandic Prime Minister has formally asked for an expression of our views before deciding how to respond to the United States proposal, I have authorised His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Reykjavik to speak to him on the following lines :: &quot; This war has shown that the presence of United States forces in the north atlantic area is essential for the security of that area. We therefore welcome theproposal that United States forces should continue to occupy bases in Iceland.We naturally assume such occupation will be brought in due course under theinternational security system provided in the United Nations Charter. In themeantime it would seem natural for an arrangement to be made direct betweenthe Icelandic and United States Governments.&quot;4.   I would propose that we should reconsider our attitude in the event ofthe Russians taking up an openly hostile attitude to the United States initiativeor demanding as a counter-move a long-term lease of bases in Denmark or northern norway.   In such circumstances it might be desirable for His Majesty&apos;s Govern-Ment to come forward as a mediator with the proposal that the Americans shouldhave a short-term lease of bases in Iceland.  We could then presumably encourageDenmark and Norway, both of whom are members of the United Nations Organisa-tion, to invoke the Security Council&apos;s procedure in respect of any Russian demands and to refuse to negotiate bilaterally.   The Norwegian Minister for ForeignAffairs has already expressed the fear that the American demands on Icelandmay lead to similar Russian demands in connexion with Spitzbergen, about wdiichftey had already made approaches to the Norwegian Government a year ago.I have accordingly authorised His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Oslo to draw M. Lie&apos;attention to the Security Council procedure as laid down in Article 43 of theUnited Nations Charter.  I am also authorising His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Copen-hagen to take similar action with the Danish Foreign Minister.1^097   [30774]
1   5.1 &apos; My reasons for adopting this policy are as follows : The choice, before us was whether to back5 the Americans in their policy of trying to secure their position now by bilateral arrangements with the icelandic government orj to insist oh the point of. view which I.had put to Mr. Byrnes.On the one hand the Chiefs of Staff and the Foreign Office agree that the&apos;vital interests of the United Kingdom would be served by the retention of UnitedStates -forces in permanent bases in Iceland. - On the other hand, it is a mainobjective1 of His Majesty&apos;s Government to make-a success of the United nations organisation/ The United States action may, by antagonising the Russians andminimising the role of the Security Council, destroy the whole United nations organisation system of security before it has been given a chance. The decisivefactor, however, seemed to be that the Americans are now committed to their scheme and have refused to accept my alternative suggestion of a short-term leasepending the setting up of the Security Council and the admission of Iceland tothe United Nations Organisation.. &apos; .. ;; , e. b.Foreign Office, 30th October, 1945,ANNEX.ON the 24th September the United States Government informed us officiallyof their intention to ask the Icelandic Government for a long-term lease of navaland air bases in Iceland. On the next day the United States Charge&quot; d&apos;Affairesin Moscow so informed the Soviet Government.2. On the 28th September, the Secretary of State wrote to Mr. Byrnessuggesting that an American demand for a long-term lease would amount to a vote of no confidence in the United Nations Organisation and that the UnitedStates Government might instead ask the Icelandic Government for a lease ofthe bases in question for a limited period and as a temporary measure pendingthe &quot;coming into force of the Security Provisions of the United Nations charter and the admission of Iceland to the United Nations Organisation.3. On the 29th September, a member of the State Department was askedorally for an asurance that the presence of the United States forces in Icelandwould in no circumstances be allowed to compromise the security of our owncommunications in the North Atlantic. The hope was also expressed that theUnited States Government would agree to grant diversionary and emergencylanding rights in their airfields in Iceland for aircraft of the British Common-wealth. It was also explained that the suggestion made in the Secretary of State&apos;sletter to Mr. Byrnes was intended not only to avoid an apparent vote of no con-fidence in the United Nations Organisation, but also to deny the Soviet government an excuse for demanding Russian bases in Denmark or Norway.4. Mr. Byrnes replied to the Secretary of State&apos;s letter that his suggestion had been communicated to the State Department with the request that the matter should be discussed with the War and Navy Departments and the Chiefs of Staff.5. The requests made in our oral communication were referred by the state department to the War and Navy Departments with the State Departmentsrecommendation.6. The Secretary of State&apos;s letter to Mr. Byrnes did not stop the UnitedStates Government from making their communication to the Icelandic Govern-ment, who were approached on the 1st October by the United States Minister inReykjavik with a request for the lease of bases.7. The matter was discussed at a secret session of the Icelandic parliament on the 2nd October. A Committee of three members of each of the four political parties was appointed to consider the matter and- to report. His Majesty&apos;minister in Reykjavik reported on the 10th October that the majority of opinion in the Committee favoured granting the American&quot; request, but that a decision was being delayed by uncertainty as to the British attitude. The United StatesMinister subsequently expressed concern at this delay.
8. On the 12th October, His Majesty&apos;s -Embassy in -Washington were instructed to express the hope to the State Department that the United StatesGovernment would seriously and urgently consider the proposal put forward inthe Secretary of State&apos;s letter to Mr. Byrnes, and, if they were convinced by ourarguments, that they would consider amending&apos; their demand on the icelandic government. 1 .&apos; ;9.: On the 25th October His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington reportedthat he! had been informed by the State Department that, the United StatesGovernment had regretfully decided that they could not do otherwise than adhere to their present course of action.10. The question of the form in which the assurances we asked for (seeparagraph 3 above) should be given has been raised by the State Department.His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington was instructed to press for writtenassurances in one of various forms. It was, however, decided that in the last resort we should be prepared to content ourselves with an oral communication of which an agreed version would be kept on record. The State Department havebeen unable to meet us on the point of written assurances, on the grounds thatany undertaking which could be construed as having the nature of a treaty wouldrequire ratification by two-thirds of the Senate, and any &quot;executive agreement &quot;would have to be published. An oral reply has been given; a copy has been handed to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and a copy is to be kept on the files of theState Department. This reply is now being examined by the Foreign Officeand the Chiefs of Staff.11. His Majesty&apos;s Minister at Reykjavik has on more than one occasionbeen sounded unofficially on behalf of the Icelandic Government regarding theattitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government, and on the 24th October he reportedthat the Icelandic Prime Minister had officially asked for an expression of our views.   Mr. Shepherd has been instructed to speak in the following sense :  &quot; This war has shown that the presence of United States forces inthe North Atlantic area is essential for the security of that area. Wetherefore welcome the proposal that United States forces should continueto occupy bases in Iceland. We naturally assume such occupation will bebrought in due course under the international security system provided inthe United Nations Charter. In the meantime it would seem natural foran arrangement to be made direct between the Icelandic and United states government.&quot;E. B.
