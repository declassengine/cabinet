Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1945.SECRET. ( Copy No.CP. (45) 300.2Qth November, 1945.CABINET.REPORT BY THE SOCIAL SERVICES COMMITTEE ON CHANGES INWAR PENSIONS.Memorandum by the Lord Privy Seal.THE Social Services Committee submit, for consideration by the Cabinet,their recommendations on certain proposals for changes in war pensions made bythe Minister of Pensions.2. The last comprehensive review of the Royal Warrant was made in 1943,when the Coalition Government presented a White Paper (Cmd. 6459) setting out a number of improvements in the rates of pension and reforms in the procedure for dealing with claims. The changes made met with general approval, but asthe war drew to a close the British Legion and other organisations began tocampaign for the appointment of a Select Committee on war pensions on the linesof the Select Committee which was appointed after the war of 1914-18. Duringthe General Election a large number of Labour candidates declared themselvesin favour of a Select Committee and it is clear that both in the House of lords and in the House of Commons a motion for the appointment of a Select Committeewould find a strong body of supporters. We agree with the Minister of Pensionsthat it is most desirable to avoid the appointment of a Select Committee, andthat the Government will find it difficult, if not impossible, to resist the appoint-ment of such a Committee unless the Minister is able to announce substantial improvements in certain of the existing provisions of the Royal Warrant.3. In examining the proposals put before us by the Minister of Pensionswe have had regard to that part of our terms of reference which bids us seek to secure consistency between the rates of payment made under the national insurance schemes and payments of a similar kind from Exchequer funds. Butwe have been driven to recognise that anything like complete uniformity isunattainable. The rates under the war pensions scheme are in many cases alreadyhigher than the rates under other schemes; there are strong traditional feelingsin favour of generous treatment for ex-Servicemen, and it can be argued that men who served in the Forces had lower earnings during the war thanmen who were directed into industry. Moreover, the burden imposed on theExchequer by the war pensions scheme is a diminishing one. For these reasonswe have in some cases recommended increases in war pensions rates which havethe effect of increasing the disparities between the war pensions scheme andother schemes. We have tried, however, to keep down to a minimum thedisparities between the war pensions scheme and the scheme to which it is mostakin, viz., the new industrial injuries scheme.4.   Our recommendations are : (a) Disablement pensions. The following changes should be made : (i) the lowest rate of pension payable for 100 per cent, disabilityshould be raised from 40s. a week to 45s. a week, with the sameincrease for &quot;other ranks &quot; above private;(ii) partially disabled men who are unable to resume their formeroccupation or to be trained for one of equivalent standardshould receive a supplement to the basic rate of 11s. 3d. withinthe maximum of 45s. in the case of a private.   (This is on the[30942]
lines of the concession made in the National Insurance (Indus-trial Injuries Bill); and(iii) the Schedule of Disabilities under the Royal Warrant should be reviewed to ensure that the percentages awarded for certaindisabilities (e.g., amputations) are adequate.- The Minister of Pensions argued strongly in favour of raising the 100 per cent, rate to 50s., but in our view it is essential to maintainuniformity here between the war pensions scheme and the industrial injuries scheme under which, it will be recalled, the Government have refused to go beyond 45s.(b) Widows Pensions.- The minimum rate of pension for a widow with children or over 40 years of age should be raised from 32s. Qd. a week to 35s. a week, which is the minimum rate of allowance paid to the wife of a serving soldier. This proposal has the effect of increasingthe disparity between the war pensions scheme and the industrial injuries scheme under which the widow with children or over 50 atthe date of her husband&apos;s death receives only 30s. a week; and theMinister of National Insurance has asked that his dissent should be recorded. The other members of the Committee feel, however, thaton the assumption that some improvements must be made in the warpensions scheme, an increase to 35s. in the rate payable to the widowof the private soldier can be justified and should be less embarrassing to the Minister of National Insurance than other possible increases.Such an increase would carry with it adjustments in the rates for widows of &quot; other ranks &quot; above private.A widow under 40 who has no children under 16 receives 20s.a week under the war pensions scheme and the Minister of Pensionsproposed to us that, as a further concession, a widow under 40 whoseyoungest child reaches 16, should not cease to be entitled to pension at the 35s. rate. Having regard to the fact that under the industrial injuries scheme a childless widow does not qualify for pension atthe higher rate of 30s. unless she had reached the age of 50 beforeher husband died, we feel that there is no justification for continuing to pay pension at the higher rate to a war widow for the few years between the date when her youngest child attains 16 and the date when she reaches the age of 40.(c) Rent allowances to widows. The present rent allowances are designedto ensure that the widow with one or more children need not spendmore than 8s. a week of her pension on rent and rates. Accordingly,where the rent and rates actually paid exceed 8s. a rent allowancerepresenting the difference between the actual payment and 8s. is granted. The maximum allowance is, however, 12s.; so that a widowwho pays over 20s. a week has to find the excess out of her pensionor other resources. The Minister of Pensions proposed that the maxi-mum should be raised from 12s. to 17s. to meet the situation in large cities where rents of over 20s. are frequently paid. While we recognisethat there is a case for some increase, we feel that it need not amountto as much as 5s. We accordingly recommend that the maximum rent allowance should be raised from 12s. to 15s.(d) Children&apos;s Allowances. The Minister of Pensions proposed that the rateof children&apos;s allowances should be raised from 11s. to 12s. Qd. a week,the rate at present paid to the serving man. The rate under the warpensions scheme is already far in excess of the rate under the industrial injuries scheme (viz., 7s. Qd.) and the anomaly will be accentuatedwhen family allowances begin to be paid, since the Family AllowancesAct, 1945, allows family allowances to be paid in addition to allowancesunder the Avar pensions scheme, i Thus, the second and subsequent children of a war widow will receive 16s. (11s.-1-5s.) as against the 5s.payable to the second and subsequent children of the widow in receiptof allowances under the industrial injuries scheme. We see noreason for increasing the disparity by raising the rate of allowanceunder the war pensions scheme from 11s. to 12s. Qd.(e) Post-Injury Wives and Children. Hitherto no allowances have been pay-able in respect of the post-injury wife or children of a war pensionerunless he is undergoing approved treatment or is in receipt of thespecial unemployability supplement.   On the other hand, under the
existing workmen&apos;s compensation scheme, the wife and children of aman who dies as a result of his injury need only show that they were dependent on him at the time of his death in order to establish a claimto compensation.The National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Bill, as introduced,made no provision for payments in respect of the post-injury wifeor children either during the lifetime of the pensioner or after his death, and an amendment which would have provided for payments to both pre-injury and post-injury wives and dhildren during the pensioners lifetime was resisted successfully in Standing Committee.It has now been decided, however, that the Bill should be amended inorder to provide for pensions for the post-injury wife and childrenafter the pensioners deathThe Minister of Pensions feels that he must apply a similar arrangement to the post-injury wife and children of the war pensionerwho dies. In addition, he wishes to provide for the payment of allowances to the post-injury wife and children during the pensioners lifetime, as is already done in the case of a &quot; pre-injury &quot;wife and children.To pay allowances for the wife and children of a warpensioner whilst he is working represents favourable treatment ascompared with that proposed for the industrial casualty, but thefact is that allowances in pre-injury cases, which have been paid for nearly thirty years, could not now be withdrawn. The Ministerfeels that, once the principle of recognising the post-injury wife is admitted, it becomes increasingly difficult to resist the strong and long-continued pressure to remove the anomaly whereby payment ornon-payment of an allowance for a wife and children is determinedby the fortuitous circumstances of when the injury was sustained.We realise that a concession in war pension cases may embarrass the Minister of National Insurance. He, however, is alreadyembarrassed by the payment of allowances for the pre-injury wife andchildren of the war pensioner, which must continue; and in all thecircumstances we recommend that the proposal of the Minister ofPensions to recognise the post-injury wife and children both duringthe lifetime and after the death of the pensioner should be accepted.(f) Parents&apos; Pensions. Under the existing scheme parents&apos; pensions are payable only in cases of need. A flat rate pension of 5s. was paidduring the 1914-18 war but was abolished in 1922. There has been some agitation in favour of the revival of this class of parents&apos; pension at an increased rate of 7s. Qd. a week. We do not recommend the revival of this pension, but we propose that the maximum rate of needspension which the Minister of Pensions may pay in exceptional cases should be raised from 30s. to 40s. in the case of two parents, and from22s. 6d. to 27s. 6d. in the case of one parent.(g) Constant attendance alloioance. The maximum allowance payable in thecase of other ranks is 20s. There are certain cases of very severeinjury where an allowance of 20s. is inadequate and we recommendthat in such cases the Minister of Pensions should be entitled to payup to 40s., which is the present maximum rate for officers.5. The cost of the improvements which we have recommended will beroughly  8 million a year initially, rising to a peak figure of probably somethingunder  20 million a year. The following table shows how these figures aremade up : Immediate.     Peak.  million.     million.Increase of 100 per cent, rate for basic grade to 45s. 3\ 6^25 per cent. (11s. 3d.) addition in certain cases (asunder Industrial Insurance Scheme), limited tothis war   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... ^ 1Widow&apos;s rate increased to 35s.Post-injury wife and childrenPost-injury widowOddments13$ 73Total......      ............ 8 19i i4 2
6. If the Cabinet approve our recommendations we suggest that the Ministerof Pensions should present a White Paper to Parliament setting out the improvements proposed. These improvements should, in general, apply as fromthe beginning of the first pay week in January.Initialled on behalf of the Committee :A. G.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,26th November, 1945.
