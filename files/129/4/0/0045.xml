THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT.       -   -       - -    140Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1945.SECRET Copy No.     55CP. (45) 295.22nd November, 1945.CABINET.COMMERCIAL POLICY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. The President of the Board of Trade will be circulating a paperregarding the outcome of the Washington discussions on commercial policy. Mycolleagues will wish to know how matters stand in relation to the Dominions.2. The Dominions are not, of course, parties to the Washington talks, but every endeavour has been made to keep them fully informed of the proposals under discussion. Our negotiators have kept Dominion representatives therein Washington in close touch with the progress of the talks; and, in addition, aseries of telegrams have been sent to Dominion Governments from here, giving them the revised text of the United States proposals as provisionally agreed inthe discussions, and dealing with the more important points contained in them.3. Telegrams received from Australia and New Zealand on the 23rd Octoberbetrayed considerable anxiety as to the outcome of the talks, particularly on thepreference issue; but the formula for dealing with tariffs and preferences wasthen under revision and it was hoped that the revised formula, as interpreted bythe commentary agreed with the Americans, would be as reassuring to DominionGovernments as it was to ourselves. By the 6th November discussions in washington, both on this revised formula and accompanying commentary andon the proposals as a whole, had advanced sufficiently to enable me to send ageneral appreciation to Dominion Governments. Accordingly, in a telegram senton that day, I gave a full explanation of the position as it had developed, saidthat we were now satisfied that we could give general support to the proposals as a basis for discussion, subject to the satisfactory rounding off of the conversations, and expressed the hope that in taking this step we would be assured of the general support of Dominion Governments.4. This telegram drew favourable replies from Canada and South Africa,who each expressed general concurrence in our proceeding as proposed, whileindicating that there were certain points which they would wish to pursuefurther at the projected international conference. &quot;Unfortunately, however,parts of the proposals, even in their revised form, still arouse serious misgivingson the part of Australia and New Zealand. Every endeavour has beenmade to reconcile them to the position reached, but both Dominions, whilewilling to take part in the proposed international discussions, insist that&quot;they must approach those discussions free of any commitment, even implied,and feel that they might prejudice their position if they were to expressacquiescence in our supporting the United States proposals. The PrimeMinister himself telegraphed to Mr. Chifley from Washington in the hope of inducing the Australian Government to reconsider their attitude, but Mr. Chifleyin reply has explained that they have been unable to do so. Copies of the telegrams exchanged between the Prime Minister and Mr. Ohifley are annexed(Appendix A) together with a copy of a telegram from the New Zealand Govern-ment making clear their position (Appendix B).5. In the case of A australia, the main difficulty has centred round theformula for dealing with tariffs and preferences which, even as interpreted inthe commentary, is regarded by the Australian Government as going further than is likely to be palatable to Australian public opinion. It seems that theyhad hoped that the formula would provide merely for negotiations for the reciprocal reductions of tariffs and preferences; their objection lies in the fact[30928] B
that the formula looks towards the elimination of preferences (even thoughdependent on adequate tariff reductions) and prescribes, further, certain rules(a) providing for a standstill on preferences, (6) as to the method by whichpreferences are to be reduced or eliminated in the negotiations. This, they feel, will give the Americans undue advantage in the negotiations. Seeing that,in practice, the formula provides us with full safeguards, we should, I think,have been able to allay these apprehensions, were it not for the fact that recentleakages in Washington have led to a series of disturbing reports in theAustralian newspapers. These have alarmed Australian public opinion and given rise to growing agitation on the subject of Imperial preference whichis now reaching embarrassing proportions. It is clear that in face of these developments the Commonwealth Government think it politically essential to beable to say, when the United States proposals are published, that they werenot a party to the negotiations, are in no way committed to the proposals, andretain their full freedom of action. No argument is likely to shake them fromthis position.6. In the case of New Zealand, the main difficulty has been not so muclithe formula relating to tariffs and preferences (though in their various telegramsthe New Zealand Government have always been a little doubtful about this) asthat section of the proposals which provides for the elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports, save in exceptional cases. The New Zealand Governmenthave made it plain that they regard the quantitative regulation of imports as anessential and permanent feature of their economic system their broad positionbeing that it is only by this means that they can keep effective control over their imports and that without such control they would inevitably be plunged once more into balance of payments difficulties, similar to those encountered beforethe war. They cannot therefore subscribe to any proposals for the elimination of quantitative restrictions on imports unless their own case can be met under one or other of the exceptions to the general rule.7. It has been explained to the New Zealand Government that quantitative regulation of imports is regarded not only by the United States but by some commonwealth countries (including ourselves) as a devise which had a most damaging effect on international trade before the war, and that great pressureis to be expected for its use to be confined to exceptional cases. It will be forthe March Conference to discuss how far these exceptional cases should extend,and New Zealand will have full opportunity at the Conference to express herviews and to endeavour to persuade other countries that the New Zealand case isone which must be met. The text of the United States proposals already allows for quantitative regulation of imports to be used by a country &apos;.&apos; confronted with &quot;balance of payments difficulties, and this phrase, it is understood, is intended tocover not merely an actual, but a threatened, adverse balance. The New zealand government fear, however, that this would not go far enough to meet the positionof a country which is neither in actual nor threatened balance of payments difficulties, and which might be obliged therefore under the rules to abandonquantitative regulation, only to be compelled to impose it again in order to correct the disequilibrium which would result.8. It is primarily with a view to keeping her hands entirely free to arguethis case with the maximum force and effect at the March Conference that theNew Zealand Government, like the Australian Government, have felt unable to respond to our request for some expression of their acquiescence and goodwill inour giving general support to the United States proposals. I do not think thatwe can well argue further with them on this point. At the same time I feel that neither the Australian nor the New Zealand hesitations ought to deter us fromsupporting the United States proposals as a basis of discussion on the linespreviously contemplated. It is clear from the telegrams that both Dominionsrecognise that we shall wish, and indeed have no alternative but to, proceed onthese lines, assuming we secure a satisfactory financial agreement, and the attitudethey have adopted is largely tactical. At the same time it is evident that, from apublic standpoint, the situation will have to be handled with care by all three governments if the impression is not to be created that we are in dispute with twoof the Dominions on the substance of the proposals and have made agreement withthe Americans our primary objective rather than agreement within theCommonwealth.A.Dominions Office, S.W. 1,22nd November, 1945.
APPENDIX A.Telegrams Exchanged between the. Prime Minister and Mr. Chifley.(1)RAF DEL, Washington, to R.A.F., Mission, Melbourne.   (Please Pass Canberra,Personal, for Prime Minister, Australia, from Prime Minister, England.)(Top Secret.) 16th November&apos;, 1945.Personal for Mr. Chifley from Mr. Attlee.1. I am sorry to learn from your telegram to the Dominions Office No. 408that you are not prepared to acquiesce in our proposal that we should give general support to the propositions which the Americans intend to put forward fordiscussion at the proposed conference on commercial policy.2. You will appreciate that from our point of view it is of vital importance that concerted measures should be taken to produce a clearance of obstacles tothe expansion of world trade. Without an expansion of exports our presentposition of external disequilibrium can never be remedied, and we see no prospectof achieving this if the anarchy which prevailed in international economic relations in the inter-war period is not replaced by the general adoption of commonrules of neighbourly conduct.3. It is for this reason that we attach great importance to the Americaninitiative. Our negotiators have taken great pains to enter into no commitments which would impose damaging handicaps on domestic policies. But you will realise that none of us can hope to achieve the desired goal of mutual advantagewithout being prepared to make sacrifices of certain liberties of arbitrary action and certain adjustments in our administrative practices. We are confident thatif success attends a conference on the lines proposed the benefits accruing to eachof the participants would greatly outweigh any disadvantages resulting fromconformity to the regime therein proposed.4. In this connection you will doubtless have noted that we have given special support to the proposal which you have so often brought to our attentionthat employment policy and trade policy should be pursued in conjunction andshould be discussed at the same conference. In this respect we have achievedcomplete success, and we were hopeful that this would have led you, if not to lendus your positive support, at least to encourage us to go forward with your generalgoodwill. You will not have forgotten that at the time when the United kingdom was hesitating whether to sign article VII without reservation you exhorted usvery strongly to go ahead.5. I quite understand your anxieties in so far as there are some commoditieson which you would prefer to retain the status quo rather than expose them to&apos;the results of a bargaining&apos; procedure. We are in the same position. But Ishould like to say that it is my strong impression that if you ever hope to secureadvantageous concessions from the Americans the proposed negotiations offer aunique opportunity of doing so. By fathering these proposals the americans have placed themselves in a position in which unless they are prepared publiclyto stultify their own initiative they cannot refrain from considering the reason-able proposals of others or from making notable contributions themselves.6. Even at this late hour, therefore, it is my earnest hope that you will beable to send us a message assuring us of your general acquiescence and goodwill.(2)R.A.F. Mission, Melbourne, to RAFDEL, Washington.19th November, 1945.For Prime Minister England from Prime Minister Australia.Repeated Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and President of Boardof Trade.Personal for Mr. Attlee from Mr. Chifley.&quot;Reference your personal signal dated 16th November.   Matter beingfurther considered to-day, will advise to-night.&quot;[30928]
Telegram from Dominion Office to Australian Government, No. 476 of22nd November, 1945.(Secret and Personal.)Following personal for Mr. Chifley from Mr. Attlee :  &quot; I have received your personal telegram of the 19th November on myreturn from Canada.&quot; We are naturally greatly disappointed that you have not felt able togive us even a limited measure of encouragement in supporting the UnitedStates proposals as a basis of discussion, all the more so as we had feltconfident that there was no major point of difference between us.&apos;&apos; However, I realise your political difficulties. We for our part willhave to go ahead in Washington, assuming we get a satisfactory financial agreement witih the United States, and I am glad to see that you recognisethis.&quot; I am consulting my colleagues as to how matter should be presented to Parliament here and will telegraph to you again shortly.&quot;R.A.F. Mission, Melbourne, to RAF DEL, Washington.19th November, 1945.For the Prime Minister of England, from the Prime Minister of Australia.Pass to Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs and to President of theBoard of Trade.Personal for Mr. Attlee from Mr. Chifley.1. Further to my signal of to-day. We have given earnest considerationto the representation in your personal telegram.2. We assure you that there is no difference between us in the sincere hope for the attainment of the broad objectives of increased trade, high level employ-ment and improved standards of living.3. Our reactions to the formula on preferences, however, are that we wouldconcede certain specific points in advance of our actual trade bargaining withthe United States of America. We want to approach the discussions with entirefreedom to use all the bargaining power which lies in preferences and not froma weakened position of prior acceptance of a formula designed possibly for eventual preference elimination.4. Quite apart from the difficulty in subscribing to a document arising outof discussions to which we have not been a party and the implications of whichwe have not had time fully to explore, there are the local political problems asso-ciated with the subject of commercial policy. We have no doubt whatever that publication of the American proposals will, notwithstanding the qualificationsin your commentary, give rise to a great deal of adverse criticism in Australiawhich will undoubtedly be exploited to the full for party political purposes. Inall the circumstances it is imperative that we should be able to announce publicly that the Government has not been a party to the publication of the document and that it is not in any way committed to it, and we must reserve complete freedom of action in relation to the proposals.5. Although we would have preferred the United Kingdom not to associateitself with the American document, we realise that you may feel it essential to go ahead. While reserving full freedom of action in relation to the proposals weshall participate in any international discussions.   .
APPENDIX B.Telegram from New Zealand Government, No. 389 of 19th November, 1945.(No. 389.   Secret.).....Addressed, Secretary of State, No. 389, repeated to New Zealand Minister,Washington, No. 586 and High Commissioner, Canberra, No. 442.Commercial Policy.  Your telegram No. 368.Our acquiescence in your statement as proposed would inevitably lead tomisunderstanding, and we would prefer that it should be known that:  -1. The New Zealand Governments policy is to maintain complete control ofits external exchange.2.   This control of exchange cannot be effective without control of imports.3. Control of imports and effective use of exchange funds is linked up withthe expansion of manufacturing facilities within the Dominion, which we consideressential if we are to meet our commitments for full employment.4. We strongly affirm our desire to maintain our preferences for UnitedKingdom imports into New Zealand and to continue to receive preferences inthe United Kingdom for New Zealand&apos;s primary products. This policy as stated above will not prevent our negotiating for the reciprocal reduction of tariffs and other means for the expansion of trade within and without the Common-wealth. We would prefer, therefore, not to be associated with the proposedstatements, and to retain full freedom, when discussions are opened in Marchand June of next year or earlier if necessary, to discuss British Commonwealthpolicy.
