(45) 291.22nd November, 1945.CABINET.NEW CONSTRUCTION (REVISED) PROGRAMME, 1945.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.MY predecessor in the last Government placed before the Cabinet on the29th June of this year a Memorandum giving details of the proposed new construction Programme, 1945 (CP. (45) 54), which was based on the need forthe Navy to build up for the Far Eastern war.2. With the end of the Japanese war, the basis of the New construction programme, 1945, has changed and it is now necessary for the shipyards to givefirst priority to Merchant Ship construction. I therefore put forward certainrevised proposals for which I ask the approval of my colleagues. The basis ofthese proposals is : (a) To proceed at normal speed with such vessels as may be required for theimmediate replacement of a, few deficiencies of outstandingimportance.(p) To proceed slowly with, or to defer, the construction of, those vessels which, though needed for the post-war Navy, may be used as a cushionto absorb the shocks of the fluctuations in the Shipbuilding Industry.A Warship Building Programme with sufficient flexibility can be usedto even out the slumps and booms of Merchant Shipbuildingproduction.3. A further advantage of a long-term Naval Building Programme is thatit will also give time to enable advantage to be taken of research into the lessons of the war.Outline of Programme.4. In substitution for the programme outlined in paragraph 7 of CP. (45) 54I propose that the 1945 Programme should now be as follows  1 Experimental-Type Submarine.2 Escort Vessels.2 Surveying Ships.6 Small Floating Docks.A number of miscellaneous small craft.The last two items were added since the 1944 New Construction Programme was approved, Treasury sanction having been obtained in each case.Battleships.5.   The preliminary work on the Lion and Temeraire has ceased.[30858]Copy NaJ
Aircraft Carriers.6. I have cancelled two of the Large Fleet Carriers and four of the LightFleet Carriers of the 1943 Programme.Cruisers.7. I propose that 6 Cruisers of previously authorised programmes should belaid down, two immediately, and the remainder over a longer period so that theycan best be fitted in with the Merchant Shipbuilding programme. I ask approval to proceed with 1 turret of new design 6-inch mountings in advance of construc-tion to be fitted in one of the above Cruisers of the 1944 Programme.Destroyers.8. I have cancelled a further 24 Destroyers of the 1943 Programme on theunderstanding that certain replacements should be made in the future on a long-term basis which will supply the shipyards with a steady flow of work.Submarines.9. As a further reduction, I have cancelled a further ten &quot;A&quot; class and two &quot; T &quot; Class Submarines of the 1943 and 1942 Programmes. To keepabreast of the progress that is being made in the design and construction of submarines, I propose that the 1945 Programme should include one Submarineof a new and experimental type.Escort Vessels.10. I also ask approval to proceed with the design of two Escort vessels of a new type, each of about 1,400 tons and with a speed of about 25 knots.These are largely experimental vessels; one will be an A/S vessel and the otheran A/A ship.Floating Docks.11. One Cruiser dock being constructed in Canada and two docks for landing ships have been cancelled, together with 16 of the 22 Docks for small craft. The remaining six had progressed so far that it was more economicalto complete them.Surveying Ships.12. I ask approval to build two surveying ships of about 1,400 tons. these ships are to carry out the essential work of Surveying, embodying the accuratechartin&amp; of the many wrecks around our coasts, the complete re-survey of allEstuarial Waters, and extensive work overseas in all areas normally used byBritish shipping.Small Craft.13. I ask approval in the normal way for the miscellaneous small craftrequired to serve the Fleet and other various duties.14. Amended statements are appended showing the cancellations in 1944and up to the end of October 1945 and the estimated cost of this Programmeseparately, and in conjunction with previous Programmes.
