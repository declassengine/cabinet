Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 271.7th November, 1945.CABINET.THE PLACE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF OVERSEAS TRADE IN THEMACHINERY  OF   GOVERNMENT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of Trade,THIS paper proposes that to secure integration of overseas commercial policyand to improve the quality of our staff charged with promoting and stimulatingoverseas trade, certain structural changes should be made in the machinerypresently used for these purposes and jointly shared by the Foreign Office, Depart-ment of Overseas Trade and the Board of Trade.It is proposed that (a) AH overseas commercial staff, except the Trade Commissioners in colonies and Dominions, should become an integral part of the Foreign Service.(b) The Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade, who is at presentalso a Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office, shouldshed this second function and become a Secretary for Overseas Traderesponsible solely to the President of the Board of Trade.(c) Either an interdepartmental Committee on External Economic Policyand Overseas Trade, composed of officials, with the Secretary for overseas Trade as Chairman, or a Ministerial Committee at the JuniorMinister level should meet regularly.2. By Statute the Secretary of the Department of Overseas Trade is appointed by, and responsible to, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs andthe President of the Board of Trade Under the President of the Board of Tradehe is recognised as the Parliamentary head of the Export Credits guarantee department and is responsible for the Imperial Institute (which has its ownvote). The Secretary is entirely responsible for the Trade Commissioners in theDominions, India, Colonies, &amp;c. His Department &apos;&apos; administers &apos;&apos; the CommercialStaff, i.e., though the latter are members of the Foreign Service yet while theyare in commercial posts in that Service their salaries are borne on the Departmentof Overseas Trade vote and their grading and promotion are partly the responsi-bility of the Comptroller-General of the Department of Overseas Trade.3. If we are to construct a Department which will do more than serve however efficiently-the formulated desires of business and will really promote and push export trade, we must have high quality men. The remedy seems tobe to integrate the policy-making and promotion functions. The Departmentof Overseas Trade and the Commercial Relations and Treaties Department ofthe Board of Trade should be brought under one administrative head; he wouldhave to devise a method whereby his information and intelligence divisions corre-lated their work with that of the various Industries Divisions, working on the&quot;internal &quot; side of the Board of Trade.4. Complete amalgamation of the Department of Overseas Trade and. theCommercial Relations and Treaties Department of the Board of Trade shouldinvolve the abandonment of Department of Overseas Trade responsibility for theCommercial Diplomatic Service. The latter would be entirely under the controlof the Foreign Office, and arrangements could be made for the association with the13010   [30833]
Foreign Office of the Board of Trade in the administrative questions arisingout of such control. Furthermore, to strengthen the link between the ForeignOffice and the Board of Trade, it is desirable that members of the Foreign office should work from time to time in the Board of Trade. The Trade Commissionerservice would, however, be the responsibility of the new Overseas Trade Divisionof the Board of Trade, though of course the existing liaison with the Dominions,India and Colonial Offices would be maintained.5.   In the formulating of policy three conclusions emerge: (a) Greater importance must now be.assigned to the promotion and facilita-tion of foreign trade than ever before in. our history.(b) The detailed responsibilities of the Board of Trade, and therefore ofits President, are far greater under a Labour Government than ever before.(c) If the Department of Overseas Trade link with the Foreign Office is tobe severed it is necessary to ensure close co-ordination between Boardof Trade and Foreign Office by some other means. This is especiallytrue if the Foreign Office takes full control of overseas publicity.Co-ordination by a Cabinet Committee can lay down broad lines of-agreed policy, but it is important to ensure it also at lower levels and;      in more detailed application.6. It is suggested that foreign trade would be given its due share ofimportance, the President of the Board of Trade could, be relieved of some of hisdetailed responsibilities, and co-ordination be achieved by the following means : .(a) A Secretary for Overseas Trade to be the Parliamentary head of the overseas Trade Division suggested in paragraph 4. He would besubordinate and responsible to the President of the Board of Trade,but he would continue to be the responsible Minister for the export credits Department, and might become similarly responsible for a statutory body to deal with the tourist trade. Responsibility for theImperial Institute might be transferred to the Secretary of State forthe Colonies.(b) An interdepartmental Committee on External Economic Policy and overseas Trade to meet regularly (possibly under the chairmanship of the Secretary for Overseas Trade). The Foreign Office, Treasury,Dominions Office, India and Burma Offices and Colonial Office wouldbe represented. Such a Committee was advocated both by the Boardof Trade and by the Department of Overseas Trade before the official committee on Machinery of Government. Or, alternatively, thereshould be a Ministerial committee composed of the parliamentary secretaries and Under-Secretaries representing those Ministries.E. B.R. S. C.7th November, 1945.
