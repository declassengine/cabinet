Printed for the Cabinet.  November 1945.----------^    secret. Copy No. ggCP. (45) 287.iQth November, 1945.CABINET.CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP BILL.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.1. A question of constitutional importance and great urgency has arisen,in consequence of the recent introduction in the Canadian House of Commons;of a Bill relating to Canadian citizenship and nationality. Second Reading ofthis Bill was obtained on the 22nd October last. The Bill, which was preparedwithout previous consultation with the other members of the British Common-wealth, proposes a radical alteration, so far as Canada is concerned, of theexisting arrangements under which the common status of a British subject ismaintained throughout the British Commonwealth on the basis of the british nationality and Status of Aliens Acts passed in the United Kingdom in 1914 and corresponding legislation in the Dominions. These arrangements have beenapproved at successive Imperial Conferences.As will be seen from the succeeding paragraphs of this Memorandum, theunilateral action by His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada raises far-reachingissues and, in my opinion, it is essential that the whole matter should be examined at an early conference of experts from the United Kingdom, the Dominions andIndia. The question could also be considered whether experts from Burma,Newfoundland and Southern Rhodesia should be invited. If my colleaguesapprove that arrangements for holding such a conference should be made (whichmight meet either in London or in Canada), it is proposed that a communication should be made to the Canadian Government by the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Canada in the, sense of the attached draft.2. As stated above, the present position in regard to British nationalitythroughout the British Commonwealth and Empire is based on the principle thatthere shall be a common code for the purpose of determining who are Britishsubjects; and that no amendments of this code by any member of the Common-wealth should be made without prior consultation and agreement with the othermembers. These principles were affirmed at the Imperial Conferences of 1930and 1937, and hitherto this arrangement has been observed by the UnitedKingdom, though at the cost of some embarrassment; by Australia and NewZealand in the letter though hardly in the spirit, since they have already conferredthe rights of a British subject in Australia (or New Zealand, as the case may be)on married women who are not British subjects, and Australia now proposes to legislate, saying that these persons shall be British subjects in Australia; by canada, with the exception of certain legislation enacted during the present war;and by South Africa with certain minor exceptions. Eire has repealed all British,nationality laws in their application to Eire and has enacted nothing in their place.It Avas recognised, however, at the Imperial Conferences of 1930 and 1937that it was open to any member of the Commonwealth to define for its own purposes what persons are entitled to be regarded as nationals or citizens of that member; and in Canada and the Union of South Africa legislative provision has been made for that purpose. The result is that within the large circle ofBritish subjects recognised as such throughout the Commonwealth and Empirethere may be smaller circles containing the citizens or nationals of each memberof the Commonwealth.[30900]
3. The Canadian Bill departs from these principles by determining inthe first instance who are Canadian citizens. The Bill also provides that everyCanadian citizen is a British subject and that persons who are British subjectsunder the laws of any country of the British Commonwealth, including the UnitedKingdom, will, though not Canadian citizens, be recognised in Canada as Britishsubjects.4. Canada is thus proposing a quite different system for defining whatpersons possess the common imperial status of a British subject. It is of someinterest that this system now proposed by Canada was, in fact, advocated atImperial Conferences and discussions as an alternative system to that now inforce and described in paragraph 2. It is a system which has certain advantages.Under the Canadian system British subjects are those persons who possess thecitizenship of any part of the Commonwealth or, in other words, British subjectsare all those persons who may be made citizens under the law of the UnitedKingdom, Canada, &amp;c. It would not, therefore, be strictly necessary that thecitizenship laws of the different members of the Commonwealth should be identical,nor that there should be consultation before any one of these laws is changed.5. The Canadian Bill, in defining Canadian citizens, contains a numberof important departures from the present law of British nationality. Unless,therefore, either Canada abandons her proposal or the other members of theCommonwealth adopt the Canadian system, the result will be that many people will be British subjects in Canada and not in other parts of the commonwealth and vice versa.- \ Some of these Canadian changes may be desirable in themselves.They include, inter alia, amendments to the present law relating to the nationality of married women, which has been the subject of so many representations inside and outside Parliament. There are, however, other desirable amendments to thepresent British nationality law which are not included in the Canadian Bill.6. The first intimation received by His Majesty&apos;s Government that it wasthe intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Canada to introduce this CanadianCitizenship Bill was by a letter dated the 28th September last to the Secretaryof State for Dominion Affairs from Mr. Frederick Hudd, the Acting High Comi-missioner for Canada. A reply to this letter was sent to Mr. Hudd by theSecretary of State for Dominion Affairs on the 8th October asking for an oppor-tunity of considering the draft Bill with a view to possible further discussionbefore the Bill was introduced : Mr. Hudd replied on the 17th October enclosingan advance copy of the text of the Bill. In that reply the Acting High Com-missioner stated that it would probably not be possible to defer the introductionof the Bill, but that the Canadian authorities concerned would be very glad tohave any observations which the United Kingdom Government might desire tomake prior to the consideration of the Bill in Committee.7. It would appear that the Candian Government and their advisers do not fully appreciate the extent of the departure from existing practice which willbe involved if this Bill should be passed into law. At the same time I take theview (which I understand is shared by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs) that there are serious disad-vantages in the present system and that the introduction of this Bill in Canadaaffords a convenient opportunity for considering whether the system now proposedby Canada is not, after all, preferable to the existing arrangements with regardto the common status, which (as shown in paragraph 2 above) seem to be breakingdown.The United Kingdom has not hitherto enacted any legislation definingcitizenship, in relation to the United Kingdom and the Colonies. If the Canadiansystem is adopted, the United Kingdom would have to do this. No distinctionhas up to now been drawn in the United Kingdom between different classes ofpersons who are British subjects, and all British subjects have enjoyed the rightof entry into the United Kingdom. Under the Canadian system it would still liepossible for the United Kingdom to continue to grant free right of entry intothis country to all British subjects from whatever part of the Empire they come, a privilege which has, I think, contributed to the loyalty and solidarity ofthe Empire.8. As shown in paragraph 2 above, difficulties have been experienced inthe actual working of the present arrangements with regard to the common status.The necessity for consultation and agreement before any amendment has beenmade has led to the most deplorable delays in effecting amendments which are
much needed. We have not yet been able to proceed with important proposals about which the Dominions had been consulted as long ago as 1927; and in thecontroversial field of the nationality of married women the necessity for obtaining the concurrence of the Dominions to any change in the law has caused consider-able embarrassment to the United Kingdom Government during the past fifteen years. Moreover, there are anomalies and obscurities in the British nationality and Status of Aliens Act, 1914, which have created administrative difficulties forthe Departments concerned, and particularly the Foreign Office.9. For these reasons, I think the time has come when the whole position should be reviewed, with a view to the possible substitution for the existing systemof a new system based on the principle of the now proposed Canadian legisla-tion. As already indicated, this would involve the necessity for a legislativedefinition of United Kingdom &quot; citizens,&quot; including persons belonging to thecolonies. The absence of any such definition has, I understand, been a source of embarrassment in the negotiation of commercial and other treaties by the UnitedKingdom Government, more especially in connection with the privileges to be accorded to British subjects belonging to the United Kingdom and colonies, e.g.,under the &quot; most favoured nation&quot; clauses in commercial treaties. In fact ithas been necessary to resort to the phrase &quot; persons belonging to &quot; and this phrase, for obvious reasons, has proved to be unsatisfactory.10. I should mention one point of detail which may prove embarrassing.If legislation is passed in this country recognising as British subjects the citizens of the Dominions, the question will arise whether it should apply to citizens of eire whom the Government of Eire do not regard as British subjects.&apos; 11. If a conference of experts is to be held, as proposed in this Memo-randum, the opportunity would be taken of reviewing the position in the lightof the above considerations and of working out an alternative plan.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1,16th November, 1945.
ANNEX., Draft Telegram to United Kingdom High Commissioner in Canada.1. Consideration has been given to terms of Canadian Citizenship Bill.Apart from possible observations on individual provisions of the Bill, we have one general comment. The principle on which the Bill is framed differsfundamentally from that underlying the existing position with regard toBritish nationality law, as the basis of the common status of all subjects ofHis Majesty, as accepted at Imperial Conferences. This position is that thereshould be a common code for the purpose of determining who are British subjects,and that no amendments of this code by any member of the Commonwealth shouldbe made without prior consultation and agreement with the other members.2. The Canadian Bill, on the other hand, determines in the first instancewho are Canadian citizens, and also provides that every Canadian citizen is aBritish subject and that persons who are British subjects under the laws ofany country of the British Commonwealth will, though not Canadian citizens,be recognised in Canada as British subjects. This foreshadows another andpossibly quite acceptable arrangement but it is a fundamental change and shouldbe discussed with all Governments of the Commonwealth.3. Further, the Canadian Bill, in defining Canadian citizens, also differsin several respects from the definition of British, subject in the present law ofBritish nationality. The enactment of the Canadian Bill in its present formwill therefore mean that many people will be British subjects in Canada andand not in other parts of the Commonwealth and vice versa, unless all othermembers of the Commonwealth either (1) adopt the Canadian system (vide paragraph 2 above), a system whichallows for divergencies in citizenship laws without impairing thecommon status; or(2) amend the definition of British subjects in their British nationalitylaws so as to correspond exactly with the definition of Canadiancitizens and refrain from making other changes.Alternative (2) hardly seems practicable.4. His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom would therefore propose that at an early date a conference of experts from the various membersof the British Commonwealth should be summoned to meet in London or, if desired, in Canada. This conference might examine, in the first place, theCanadian system for determining the common status of British subjects. Inthe second place, it might examine the merits of all the amendments to the definition of British subjects (or of Canadian, &amp;c. citizens, supposing theCanadian system on (1) is adopted) which any of the Governments of the Common-wealth may care to propose, including all those contained in the Canadian Bill.Naturally, the consideration of these amendments will be considerably simplified,if agreement is reached to adopt the Canadian system on (1), because, in that case,common agreement on all points of detail is no longer necessary.5. It is appreciated that the Canadian Government might find difficultyin deferring further progress with their Bill pending the meeting of such aconference. It is, however, noted that the Bill contains a clause providing thatit shall come into force upon a date to be fixed by proclamation. The canadian government might, therefore, be willing to consider postponing that date untilthe conference of experts has taken place, so that it would be possible to take into account any conclusions of that conference.6. We should be glad to learn whether the Canadian Government agreeand what are their views as to the place of meeting. If they agree we should at once communicate with the other Governments with a view to arranging aconference.
