Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 285.15th November, 1945.CABINET.RELEASE OF DOCTORS FROM THE FORCES.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.r ., IN the attached minute, the Secretary of State for War asks for guidance on the method of giving effect to the Cabinet&apos;s decision regarding the release of doctors from the Army (CM. (45) 51st Conclusions, Minute 5).2. I recommend the adoption of alternative (a), viz., accelerating releases in Class A to the extent necessary to produce the numbers prescribed by theCabinet.The Secretary of State for War regards this as &quot;a plain departure fromthe age and service principle.&quot; I do not think it need be so regarded. It is truethat it would involve discriminating between doctors and all other officers in theArmy. But there are sound arguments for such a discrimination, apart fromthe urgent public need to increase the number of doctors available for the civilpopulation. Within the Army, doctors are a class apart from other officers : theywere recruited as a professional class by different means and under different conditions from all other officers, and they serve in a separate Corps. I do notthink it unreasonable, therefore, that the conditions for their release should be different from those prescribed for regimental officers. Nor do I believe thatsuch a discrimination would provoke ill-feeling in the Army.Within the R.A.M.C., the age and length of service principle would bemaintained. Doctors would be released by age and service groups; but progressthrough those groups would be more rapid for doctors than for other officers.3. The second objection raised by the Secretary of State for War is that nearly all the specialists are in the earlier groups, and that they cannot be sparedby the Army, and are not urgently required for the civil population. this difficulty can, I think, be met, once the principle suggested in paragraph 2 above is adopted. For it should not take long to identify the specialists whom the Armycannot spare; and these could be retained in the Army, under the &apos;&apos; military necessity &apos;&apos; clause, even though other doctors in their age and service group werebeing released.4. I therefore suggest that the War Office should give effect to the cabinets decision of the 8th November by arranging for doctors to be released up to whatever age and service group is required in order to yield by the 31st December,1945, the net numbers prescribed by the Cabinet, after deduction of any specialistswho may have to be retained in the Army.H. M.Office of the Lord President, S. W. 1,15th November, 1945.Annex.Lord President of the Council.The Cabinet on the 8th November decided that a total of 5,600 doctors mustbe released from the Army by the 31st December, 1945.   This decision involves the release of 1,881 doctors over and above those who were due for release underthe existing plan.[30897]t
There are three conceivable alternative ways of putting the Cabinet decisioninto effect:  ..(a) I estimate that the gross numbers required could be made available byreleasing all the doctors in groups 1 to 33 inclusive by the31st December.   Orders to this effect could be issued.(&amp;) The Central Medical War Committee could be asked to provide lists ofnames, and the individuals so named could be offered release in Class B.(e) Commands could be instructed to select doctors up to a stated number in each Command and to order their release under Release Regulations,paragraph 327, on the ground of &quot; services no longer required.&quot;Alternative (a) is a plain departure from the age and service principle, andI am not prepared to accept it. Moreover, nearly all the specialists are in theearlier groups and they can neither be spared by the Army nor are they wantedby the Ministry of Health.Alternative (b) will take a long time. First, the Committee must provide the list of names; second, the individual must be approached with the offer. We know that many doctors will refuse release in Class B largely owing to the uncertaintiesat present affecting their future as doctors.The clause of the Release Regulations referred to at (c) is used to deal withisolated special cases, including criminals and half-witted personnel. It was never intended as a method of getting rid of complete classes or blocks of personnel.None of the alternatives would ensure that released doctors would go back into practice at all, or, if they did, that they would be the sort of doctor requiredor that they would work where required.I have laid before you the position as I see it and should like an opportunityof discussing the best means of implementing the Cabinet instructions.I have sent copies of this letter to the First Lord of the Admiralty, theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister of Labour.(Signed) J. J. LAWSON.13th November, 1945.
