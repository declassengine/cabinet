Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET.CP. (45) 267.Hh November, 1945.CABINET.RELEASES OF DOCTORS FROM THE ARMED FORCES.Report to the Prime Minister by the Home Secretary and - the attorney General.IN your directive of the 20th September (CP. (45) 186), you asked us toexamine the possibility of increasing the number of doctors to be released fromthe Armed Forces in 1945 beyond the gross release of about 4,500 then planned.You pointed out that the great disparity between the standards of medical serviceavailable for men and women in the Armed Forces and those available for the civilian population should be reduced, and that particular regard should be paidto nleans of securing economies in the use of doctors in the forces.2. The Minister of Health and Secretary of State for Scotland considerthat there should be at least 9,000 more doctors in civil practice at the end of 1945than there were at the middle of the year. The most urgent need is for general practitioners; while the Ministers estimate that 7,125 general practitioners are needed to replace over-age practitioners and to bring civilian standards up to areasonable level, they are prepared to accept a figure of 4,700 under this head.To meet the needs of other branches of the medical service, e.g., hospitals, teaching,public health, 4,300 doctors are required by the end of the year. There are other demands as well as those of the civilian population in this country. To restore the 1939 standards in the Colonial Medical Service, 250 doctors are needed, while there are certain small requirements for relief work under the Foreign Office.3. As a result of discussion, the Service Ministers have somewhat increased the rates of release of doctors which were originally proposed for the period from the 18th June to the 31st December. On certain assumptions about intake(considered in paragraph 4 below), the folloAving are the net releases which wouldresult from the Service Ministers&apos; proposals :-Royal Navy      ...............      435Army.........       .........    3.719RA.F...................      720Total   ...      ............    4,874(There will also be a net release of 117 doctors from the Indian ArmyMedical Corps bringing the total up to a net release of 4,991.)4. In putting&apos; forward their proposals, the Service Ministers asked forintakes of young practitioners in the four months from September to December1945 as follows : Royal Navy ............      ... 60Army ...      ....       ......... 480R.A.F.     ... ..........-    ...... nil total .........      ...... 540Against this demand it is estimated that only 200 young practitioners willbecome available for call up.  It is recommended that this call up should continue,in conformity with the general principle that young men should be called up in[30815]Copy No. &apos; (j
order to relieve older men who have undergone a period of service. Wejrecommend that the intakes should be as follows :--Royal Navy      ...       ......       ...       ...        30Army      ...       ................      170R.A.F.    ......      ...  -   ...      ......       nil total   ...............      ...      200On the assumption that the gross releases in Class &quot;A&quot; and other releases in IClass &quot; B &quot; as proposed by the Service Ministers were to stand, the net release!of doctors would, of course, be increased by the difference between the intake!of 540, for which they ask and the figure of 200 which we propose, i.e., the net Irelease would become 5,214.5. The proposals of the Service Ministers assume that doctors will continue jto be released in accordance with the general principles of the demobilisation!scheme based on age and length of service. These are, however, of different appli-lcation in the three Services :  . Royal  Navy. The Admiralty  propose  ultimately  to  release  three Idoctors for every 1,000 men and women released, this being their present!overall ratio of doctors to personnel.   This cannot, however, be achieved in1945, when the release of doctors will be smaller than would result fromobservance of this principle.Army. In accordance with the principle that all branches of the army should release the same groups at the same time, the release of doctors will jproceed up to Group 24 by the end of the year, to give a gross release of3,900 doctors in Class &quot;A.&quot;   In addition, the Secretary of State for Warproposes a special release of 100 doctors in Class &quot; B.&quot;R.A.F. The R.A.F. will release doctors up. to Group 28 by the end ofthe year.6. We consider that the needs of. the civil population demand a biggerrelease of doctors than that proposed by the Service Ministers. The present ratio of general practitioners to civil population is 0-4 per 1,000; if all doctors, i.e.,those in hospitals, public health service, &amp;c, are included the ratio is only 0-77per 1,000. It is unnecessary for us to emphasise the grave dangers attendantupon this shortage of civilian medical practitioners. The strength of the medicalprotection in civilian practice now seems to us to provide entirely inadequatecover against the risks which must be faced. We believe that it is imperative that the strength of the civilian medical service should be substantially increased in the immediate future and certainly before the end of the year.7.   At the 31st May, the position in the three Services was as follows : Number of      Doctors perdoctors.      1,000 men andtuomen.Royal Navy......      ...       2.596 3-0Army .........      11,421 3-1R.A.F.        .........        2,520 2-26It is to be strongly emphasised that these ratios were based on a war-timeestablishment intended to meet the risk of possibly heavy battle casualties andto maintain the general standard of health of the Services at a level consistent with the necessities of active service against the enemy. The cessation of hostilities-ties has not, however, been followed by any substantial drop in the ratio of doctorsto ordinary Service personnel. As between different Military theatres the rationot unnaturally varies more widely. In the United Kingdom the Army ratio asat the 31st August, 1945, was 2-28 per 1,000; whilst in the India and A.L.F.S.E.A.theatre the ratio was as high as 4-32. The Rhine Army, including Norway and1 the Channel Islands, show-s a ratio of 2-24, whilst in East Africa, for a force of157,000 odd the rations as low as 1-68. The figures for the R.A.F. show similarvariations, the ratio being as high as 2-9 in South-East Asia as against 1-3 in western Europe and 1 - 94 in the United Kingdom. It is said the United Kingdomratio will soon be down to 1 - 4. No figures as to ratio as between different theatresare available for the Navy. While the release proposed by the Secretary of Statefor War involves an appreciable reduction in the ratio of doctors to total strength in the Army, the proposed release from the R.A.F. involves only a very slighti
fall in the ratio, while in the Navy there will be an increase in the proportion of doctors to personnel.8. The Service Ministers urge that a comparison of ratios of doctors topersonnel in the Forces with that of doctors to civil population is misleading;they point to the special nature of their commitments. We do not think thereis now much substance in the plea that the duties of the Service Doctors are necessarily more extensive than those of civilian practitioners and embracepreventive and positive medicine. In fact, the Service Doctor is concerned with what is probably the most healthy section of the community, and he does *aot,in general, have the additional work involved in caring for the elderly and thediseased, not to mention the maternity and other special cases which are primarily the concern of civilian practitioners. Moreover, the importance ofpreventive medicine is scarcely less in the case of the civilian community thanit is in the .Services although it is, unfortunately, true that the practice of-preventive medicine outside the Services has been gravely reduced by theshortage of civilian doctors. Whilst we wrould not suggest that the services could operate on the same ratio of doctors to personnel as exists in civilianpractice we should certainly expect that in the exceptional and critical con-ditions existing at present and having regard to the cessation of hostilities theServices would be able, no doubt at some sacrifice of existing standards, soto reorganise their arrangements as to make do with a ratio of doctors topersonnel not exceeding about twice that available to the civilian community.9. We accordingly propose that the number of doctors in the services should, by the end of 1945, be reduced to that needed to give a ratio of twodoctors per 1,000 personnel. This would involve the following net releases forthe period from the 18th June to the 31st December : Royal Navy    ......      &apos;.........      1,265Army..................      5,600R.A.F.......      ....      .........        8807,745(Note. In calculating the release for the Army, we have made full allow-ance-Hamounting to 1,100 doctors Tor R.A.M.C doctors needed for indian and Colonial troops. This figure is short of the minimum demand of theMinister of Health and Secretary of-State for Scotland hy 1,255 doctors, butexceeds the proposals of the Service Ministers by over 2,500.10. We realise that we have reached this result by a somewhat arbitrarymethod, but, as a detailed examination of establishments is manifestly impossible,we see no other method. We are, however, satisfied that an overall ratio of2 per 1,000 should be sufficient to provide a medical service adequate for existingMilitary needs if it is averaged out as between the different theatres. No doubt the ratio to be maintained in the Far East must be higher : something substantially less than 2 per 1,000 can, however, be achieved in the Home Theatre; the R.A.F.in fact improve upon it easily-in the United Kingdom and in Western Europe.11. The reduction in the proportion of doctors to total strength which we propose will enforce - economies in the Services. We have examined the standards of establishment in certain branches of the Services (e.g., hospitalestablishments) and while there is no evidence that these standards are wastefulin themselves, the scale of medical provision generally is more generous than we can afford in present circumstances. We are inclined to think that the ratio of available hospital beds to 1,000 personnel now maintained involves someover-insurance and we think also that with some inevitable sacrifice of standards,although without reducing these to the point of danger, the ratio of doctors tooccupied beds in hospitals could be lowered. Moreover, we are inclined to thinkthat the number of routine examinations and boardings could be reduced andthat the medical examination on demobilisation might safely be simplified withresultant economy in personnel. It is at present more important that medical practitioners should be made available for civilian practice than that every possible Service pension claim should be excluded.12. There is already a considerable degree of co-operation among the three services. Apart from the creation of a new inter-service organisation, which wedo not recommend, further co-operation can be achieved only by detailed con-sideration of medical establishments throughout the Services, and we recommend
that the Service Ministers should ensure that special attention is given by theirmedical departments to this question.13. In order to achieve the releases which we propose, it will be necessaryto depart to some extent from the principles of demobilisation by age and lengthof service. This is an issue of policy which must be the subject of cabinet decision. We would point out, however, that doctors cannot be made availablefor the civil population in adequate numbers and in time to meet the dangers ofthe winter unless the release scheme is modified. It is, however, important notonly to increase the number of doctors in civil practice, but also to ensure thatthe right kind of doctors are released and that they practise in the places wherethe need is greatest. This could be achieved by increasing the number of releases in Class &quot; B,&quot; with the machinery of the Central Medical War Committeeproviding the names of the doctors who are most needed to the Service-Departments.J.
