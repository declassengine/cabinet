(45) 294.21st November, 1945.CABINET.PALESTINE RENEGADES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I shall be glad of a decision by the Cabinet on the disposal of Palestinerenegades.2. There are a number of Palestine Arabs who co-operated with the axis power. Most of them took a conspicuous part in the troubles in Palestine beforethe war. The Palestine Government are ready to deal under their own law withfourteen of them, but there are twenty-one whom they do not desire to see backin Palestine.3. Much the most important of these is the Mufti of Jerusalem. He andtwo of his followers are in French hands. They have been living under conditions of residence surveillee on the outskirts of Paris since May of this year.Five others are in our hands in Brussels and one in Italy. Of the rest, threehave succeeded in reaching Syria, one is in Turkey, one is believed to have died,and nothing has been heard of the other seven.4. Strong representations were made to the French in May and again inJune that the Mufti should be handed over to S.H.A.E.F. but they did not complywith the request, and with the dissolution of S.H.A.E.F. they seem to have assumed that the request had lapsed. Their first reaction to a further formalrequest on the 17th October was to ask what we propose to do with the Muftiif he is handed over and whether it is intended to bring him to trial as a warcriminal.5. Meanwhile the security authorities in Brussels are also anxious to be relieved of the five Palestinians held in the military prison there. Clearly, there-fore, it is desirable to take a general decision on the matter.6. It is very likely that evidence sufficient to justify prosecution forassistance given to the enemy during the war would be forthcoming. A summaryof the information available against the Mufti is contained in the telegram from palestine appended as Annex I. Evidence of the same kind, though not alwaysso strong, could be produced against the other renegades.7.   There are three possible methods of prosecution  (i) Trial  in  Palestine  under  Palestine  Defence  Regulation  No.   24(Annex II). On conviction sentence of death would be possible,(ii) Trial in the United Kingdom under Defence Regulation 2A (Annex III).As the men in question are not British subjects they could not be tried for treason or under the Treachery Act. On conviction under regulation 2A sentence of penal servitude for life would be possible,(iii) Trial as war criminals. It might perhaps be possible to arrange this in the case of the Mufti, though probably not for most of the others.At one time it was thought that the Yugoslav Government would press for the Mufti&apos;s trial as a war criminal in connection with his associa-tion with the Yugoslav Moslem S.S. Division, but it is understood thatthis proposal has now been dropped.[30915]
8. No doubt there will be a considerable body of opinion which will press for prosecution, at least in the case of the Mufti. There are, however, cogentreasons on the other side which apply in some degree to all the renegades, butare particularly strong in the case of the Mufti himself. The Mufti is stillregarded with respect by Arab and Moslem peoples in many parts of the world and as a religious leader he retains a certain sanctity in their eyes. His actionsare regarded by them as being those of an honest patriot inspired rather by anti-Zionist than anti-British intention, and it is certain that, should he be broughtto trial either in Palestine or elsewhere, there would be political repercussionsvery damaging to us in the Middle East and other Moslem countries. Lord Gortconsidered that it would be highly undesirable that he, or any of his followers,should be brought back to Palestine either for prosecution or otherwise. He was certain that even his reappearance there, still more his trial, would have acalamitous effect. Repercussions from his trial either before a United Kingdomcourt or a United Nations tribunal might not be quite so calamitous but they wouldcertainly be strong. Also there would be considerable difficulty in gettingwitnesses here for the prosecution and for the defence, there are arguments of equity against trying him here, and if he were convicted to penal servitude for life his detention here would present a difficult problem.9. I am forced, therefore, to the conclusion that it would be most unwisefor the Mufti to be brought to trial either in Palestine or in the United kingdom or before a United Nations tribunal. But both his record and his undoubtedcapacity for further mischief make it imperative that he should not go free.I therefore consider that the most satisfactory course would be to send him toSeychelles, where he could be legally detained as a political prisoner. TheGovernor of Seychelles has agreed that arrangements could be made for this. Iwould propose also the same arrangement for the other renegades whom thePalestine Government is not ready to deal with itself. I hope that the cabinet will confirm this view.10. The Secretary of State for the Home Department considers it most desirable that if they are to go to Seychelles they should be sent direct from theContinent without coming to the United Kingdom. If they were brought hereit would be possible, as they are not British subjects, to refuse them leave to land under the iUiens Order and to detain them, temporarily. While so detained here,however, they would be able to apply for a writ of habeas corpus and, quite apartfrom any uncertainty as to the decision on such an application, it would not then be possible to move them to Seychelles until the court had decided on it.Moreover, once they had arrived in the United Kingdom the only means of forcingthem to leave would be to make a Deportation Order against them and it is not thought that such an Order would justify placing them on a ship bound forSeychelles and not for their country of origin, i.e., Palestine. I agree with theHome Secretary that it is therefore most desirable that they should go direct to Seychelles in one of His Majesty&apos;s ships.11. Detention in Seychelles would be possible under a local Ordinance.There is already in existence a Political Prisoners&apos; Detention Ordinance whichwould only require a small amendment. It will not be the first time that political prisoners from Palestine have been detained in Seychelles.G. H. H.Colonial Office,.    21st November, 1945.
