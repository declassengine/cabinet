SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 269.Qth November, 1945.   *CABINET.-   . COMMERCIAL  POLICY.Memorandum by the President of the Board of Trade.DISCUSSIONS with the Americans which have been proceeding side by side with the financial talks have reached an advanced stage, and they now hope to publish on Sunday, as their proposal, the document which has been underdiscussion. We should hope, with the general support of the Dominions, to beable immediately thereafter to indicate our support of the document as a basis for discussion. Following is a brief indication of the main points, on all of which our negotiators have established our essential point of view where it differed from the original United States proposals.(1) Procedure. (a) A conference of fifteen nations (including all theDominions and India) in, say, March, to consider the document andto initiate bilateral negotiations on tariff matters.(b) A United Nations conference in, say, June, to set up an Inter-national Trading Organisation on the basis of the document as revised in March. Nations joining, and thereby subscribing to the general rules in the document, if not in the original fifteen, would be requiredwithin a reasonable space of time to make comparable agreements dhtariff matters.&apos;(2) Imperial Preference. This has been the critical point. At Annex A isthe full text of the American proposal on preferences as it has emerged from a long discussion. At first the Americans were inclined to makeit a sine qua non that we (and therefore the Dominions) should agreeto a form of words which would have bound us to do awray withpreference in a comparatively short space of time. We resisted this.Relying upon Article VII of the Mutual Aid Agreements, we have brought them round to a formula which, subject to an interpretationwhich we are seeking to be enabled to give without fear of contra-diction, can be accepted. The text of this interpretation is at Annex B.(3) Apart from the preference issue, the United States proposal (entitled&quot; Proposal to set up an International Organisation &quot;) is arranged asshown in Appendix C.The main points of interest are (a) The Preamble. This emphasises the need for international co-operation on economic matters, requires each member of the. Organisation toadopt full employment policies and says that no nation should seek the maintenance of employment through measures that aggravate theproblems of other nations.(b) State Trading. Our own policies are safeguarded, but.State Trading isnot to be used to introduce by a side-wind protection greater thanthat allowed for as a result of the proposed tariff negotiations. Empirepreference and long-term contracts are also safeguarded.[30825] b41Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945. &quot; 6 8
(c) Subsidies and Export Subsidies. The former are allowed, the latter are subject to rules which considerably limit the freedom of the UnitedStates to force her agricultural products on export markets.(d) Transitional Period and Balance of Payments Difficulties. Our needfor Import Regulation and Exchange Control in such circumstancesis recognised, but import quotas are not to be used for protective purposes. (This use of quotas by other countries is a potential menace to our exports.) 9(e) International Cartels. -The Americans have been induced to give up their proposal for outlawing certain named practices (e,g., division of markets). Instead there is provision for complaint by a Government,consideration by the Organisation, and recommendation to the Govern-ment of the offending concern, the latter Government being then leftto act in accordance with its own procedures.(f) United Kingdom Agriculture. Our negotiators were instructed to safe-guard the position for a long-term policy of reasonable stabilisation and adequate remuneration for our agriculture. On this point we havehad a very frank exchange of views with the Americans, who wellunderstand our position and have made provision in their document which gives us the elbow-room that we need for our policy of Statepurchase and averaged prices.R. S. C.Board of Trade, S. W. 1,Qth November, 1945.ANNEX A.Revise of Preferences Formula.1. In the light of the principles set forth in Article VII of the Mutual AidAgreements, members should enter into arrangements for the substantial reductionof tariffs and for the elimination of tariff preferences, action for the elimination of tariff preferences being taken in conjunction with adequate measures for the substantial reduction of barriers to world trade, as part of the mutually advan-tageous international arrangements contemplated in this document.2. As an initial step in the process of eliminating tariff preferences itshould be agreed that (a) Existing international commitments will not be permitted to stand inthe way of such action as may be agreed upon with respect to tariff preferences.(6) All negotiated reductions in most-favoured-nation tariffs will operateautomatically to reduce or eliminate margins of preference.(c) Margins of preference on any product will in no case be increased andno new preferences will be introduced.ANNEX B.Explanation of Preferences Formula.1. The formula determines the procedure to be followed by common consent in considering, in the context of a general lowering of tariffs and other trade barriers, what contribution can be made from our side by way of reduction orelimination of preferences.2. The formula makes it clear that, in pursuit of the objectives ofArticle VII of the Mutual Aid Agreements, we for our part are ready to agreethat the existing system of preferences within the British Commonwealth and empire is capable of contraction pari passu with the improvement in trading conditions between Commonwealth and Empire countries and the rest of theworld.
3. The formula further provides that in entering negotiations for thereduction of tariffs the parties concerned will not refuse to discuss the modifica-tion of particular preferences on the ground that these are the subject of priorcommitments; on the contrary, all margins of preference will be regarded asopen to negotiation and it will, of course, be for the party negotiating the modification of any margin of preference which it is bound by an existingcommitment to give to a third party to obtain the consent of the third partyconcerned.4.   Further points to be noted are :  (1) The formula makes it clear there is no commitment on any country inadvance of negotiations to reduce or eliminate any particular margin of preference. The position is that each country remains free to judge, in the light of&quot; the offers made by all the others, the extentof the contribution it can make towards the realisation of the agreedobjective.(2) It is recognised that reduction or elimination of preferences can onlybe considered in relation to and in return for reductions of tariffs and other barriers in the world as a whole which would make formutually advantageous arrangements for the expansion of trade.There is thus no question of any unilateral surrender of preferences.There must be adequate compensation for all parties affected.5. This formula does not in advance of the detailed negotiations lay downhow far the process of reduction and elimination of preferences will be carriedat this immediate stage. It must be realised that some preferences are ofparticular importance to the economy of certain parts of the world just as sometariffs are important in others. The immediate elimination of all preferenceswould be such a step as would require a very drastic clearance of other trade barriers involving substantial and widespread reductions in tariffs and othertrade barriers by a large number of countries. All this is well recognised. Thus,the degree to which the final objectives can be reached at the initial stage canonly appear at the negotiations themselves and as the result of a mutuallyadvantageous settlement.ANNEX C.SUMMARY OF UNITED STATES PROPOSAL TO ESTABLISH ANINTERNATIONAL TRADE ORGANISATION.Inter-relation of Trade and Employment Problems and Measures.High and stable levels of employment are essential for an enlarged volumeof trade. Prosperity in each nation depends on the prosperity of other nations,the levels of employment in the major industrial nations having an especially important influence in this respect. Accordingly there should be an undertaking that (1) Each signatory nation will take appropriate action designed to securefull employment within its own jurisdiction.(2) Maintenance of employment should not be sought through measures whichaggravate the trade and employment problems of other nations.Proposal to Establish an International Trade Organisation.Measures designed to expand trade are essential to reach maximumemployment, production and consumption. To attain these objects continuousinternational collaboration will be necessary. It is accordingly proposed toestablish an International Trade Organisation of the United Nations, the membersof which would undertake to conduct their international commercial policies andrelations in accordance with agreed principles to be set forth in the articles of theOrganisation.Chapter I. Purposes and Principles of the Organisation.These would aim at effective expansion of world production, employment,and the exchange and consumption of goods.[30825] b 2
Chapter II. Membership.Chapter III. Principles relating to Commercial Policy.A. General Commercial Provisions.There would be a body of rules of the kind normally found in commercial treaties governing e.g., internal duties, transit duties, anti-dumping duties, tariffvaluations, marks of origin, &amp;c. The working-out of these rules in detail would fall to the International Trade Organisation.B. Tariffs and Equality of Tariff Treatment.Countries should take effective and expeditious steps, on lines to be agreedto bring about substantial reductions of tariffs and elimination of tariff preferences. Emergency action to prevent sudden and widespread unemployment would be provided for.C. Quantitative Restrictions.The member countries would undertake in general not to maintain any importor export restrictions, subject to the following main exceptions : (1) Restrictions required in the early post-war transition period, to economiseshipping space, to secure equitable distribution of products in short supply, and for the orderly liquidation of war surplus stocks in thehands of Governments.(2) Restrictions required to relieve conditions of distress in exporting countries due to shortages of foodstuffs or other essential products.(3) Import quotas on agricultural products necessary to the enforcement of govermental measures (a) restricting marketing or production; or(&amp;) intended to dispose of temporary domestic surpluses.(4) To safeguard the balance of payments.D. Subsidies.1. General subsidies would be permitted; but members should inform theOrganisation and be prepared to discuss their action if the subsidy increasesexports or diminishes imports.2. Export subsidies. &quot;These are disapproved. Three years after the end ofhostilities, members granting such subsidies would undertake to discuss their action.3. Commodities in world surplus.- The provisions of 1 and 2 above wouldnot apply to commodities declared by the Organisation to be in burdensome worldsurplus if inter-governmental action had failed to suggest other wTays of removing the surplus. Even then the subsidy should not increase the export share of thecountry concerned.E.- State Trading.1. Equality of Treatment. Members should accord equality of treatment to other members. For this purpose, their State trading enterprises, in making-purchases and sales, should be guided solely by commercial considerations, suchas price, quality, terms of sale, &amp;c.2. State monopolies of individual products. State-trading is not to introducegreater protective or preferential margins than would be allowed as a result of tariff negotiations.3. Complete State monopolies of foreign trade. Countries should undertaketo purchase from other members, on a non-discriminatory basis, products valued at not less than an aggregate amount to be agreed upon.F. -Exchange Control.This is dealt with by reference to the International Monetary FundAgreement.
I   Chapter IV. Principles relating to Restrictive Business Practices.\ This chapter begins by declaring that certain types of business practice (of* which examples are given) may impede full employment policies and the objectsJof the convention.Any member may bring to the notice of the Organisation a complaint thatthe objectives of the document are being frustrated by restrictive business practicesof international character. The Organisation is then to investigate the matter,and, if the complaint is found justified, may make recommendations to theGovernments of the offending business concern for action under their own laws.Chapter V. Principles relating to Intergovernmental CommodityArrangements .1. Intergovernmental commodity arrangements involving restrictions on production or trade may be desirable to facilitate adjustments and the solutionof problems affecting particular commodities, thus avoiding resort to unilateral action by the countries affected.2. Such arrangements, if they involve limitation of production or exportsor allocation of markets, should not be entered into unless and until the Organisa-tion has (1) investigated the root causes of the problem; and (2) has determined that a burdensome world surplus exists which cannot be corrected by the play of market forces; and unless a programme of adjustment has been prepared andadopted by members, calculated to solve the problem in a reasonable time.3. Governing Principles. The following principles should ^govern inter-governmental commodity arrangements : (a) they should be open on equal terms to all members; (6) members substantially dependent on imports of the com-commodity concerned should have an equal voice with exporting countries; (c) they-should assure adequate supplies for world consumption at all times at reasonable prices; (d) they should provide increasing opportunities for meeting world require-ments from sources able to supply them most effectively.4. Such arrangements should not remain in effect initially for more than five years; if renewed, it must be shown that substantial progress towards solutionof the underlying problem, has been made or is in prospect.5. Existing or future intergovernmental commodity arrangements should besubmitted to the Organisation for review.Chapter VI. Organisation.The International Trade Organisation, its functions, organisation, and rules of procedure, and its relation to other international organisations are dealt within detail.
