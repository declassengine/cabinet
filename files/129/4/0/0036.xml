M.Prlsy Council Office, S.W.T-15TII NOVEMBER,  19h7.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of........................................................TOP SECRET Copy No.110* *CP. (45) 2861-5TH NOVEMBER,  1 9k5CABINETATOMIC ENERGYMemorandum hy the Lord, president of the Gouncil1.      I conveyed to the Prime Minister the points raised in our discussion in cabinet on 15th November(C.Mi(h5) 53rd Meeting,. Minute 3).2.      On the first point the Prime Minister took the viewthat the Commission proposed in paragraph 7 of theannouncement would not Toe the appropriate &quot;body to considerthe effect of the veto provisions in the United nations charter on any proposals for an international agreement forthe control of atomic energy..3.      As regards the apparent inconsistency &quot;between paragraphs and 6 of the announcement, the Prime Minister&apos;s view wasthat there was no real inconsistency, since the safeguardssuggested in paragraphs 6 and 7 were dependent on thedevelopment of confidence and co-operation among all- nations..He also felt that it was unnecessary to alter the last sentence of paragraph 6, since the effective enforceablesafeguards against the use of atomic energy for destructivepurposes were set out in paragraph 7*h.      The Prime Minister asked me to inform the Cabinet that, .while he realised that the statement was capable of improve-ment in certain respects and while he appreciated the suggestions which had been made by the Cabinet, he did not feel that he would be justified in attempting to secure atthat late stage verbal changes in a document on v/hich. agree-ment had been reached only with great difficulty.
