Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (45) 292.215?; November, 1945.CABINET.NEWFOUNDLAND.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.1. On the 1st November (CM. (45) 48th Conclusions) the Cabinet expressed general approval of the proposals outlined in my paper CP. (45) 234 for enabling the people of Newfoundland to choose their future form of government for themselves.   I was asked, however, to look further into two points : (a) It was suggested that, in order to avoid any risk of business and financial interests securing unduly large representation in the proposed national Convention, it might be preferable for the elections to theConvention to be held on a vocational rather than a geographical basis,or, alternatively, for the two methods to be combined.(6) The question was raised whether it would not be more appropriate forany change in the status of Newfoundland to be considered in the firstinstance by an Imperial Conference including representatives of theDominions rather than by the Parliament at Westminster alone.2. I have consulted the Commission of Government on the first point, andtheir strong advice is that the geographical basis should be retained. A vocationalbasis would, in their view, be open to grave obj ection, since while there are a numberof Unions, Associations and other groupings in Newfoundland, a large part ofthe population, including the great majority of the fishermen, does not belong tosuch bodies and could not be represented in this way. The Commission point outalso that even within such groupings opinion on political and constitutional questions is very divided. They feel that it would be very difficult therefore toobtain a truly representative Convention by a vocational method, and they suggest also that it would be an insuperable task to assess with reasonable accuracythe number of representatives which would properly be assigned to each bodyor group of bodies. Moreover, there would, they fear, be no effective controlover the way in which the various bodies selected, representatives, and this wouldmean that there would be full scope for intrigues and manoeuvres which mightwell distort completely the expression of the people&apos;s opinions. Finally, they make the point that the vocational method would be unfamiliar to Newfound-landers and that Newfoundland public opinion would not be likely to be satisfiedunless the Convention called upon to consider the constitutional issue were tobe composed of representatives elected on the traditional territorial basis and thuscomparable with the elected House of Assembly whose decision led to the surrender of self-government in 1933.3. These objections, they consider, would hold good even if the vocationalmethod were to be supplemented by elections on a geographical basis. At the sametime, they fully recognise how important it is to ensure that the fishermen and workers receive full representation in the Convention, and it was on this accountthat they suggested that all candidates for election should be required to bebona fide residents in the districts they seek to represent. They have considered whether some system of primary and secondary elections might not constitute afurther safeguard, but this, they feel, would be too complicated to be practicable.They consider, however, that the situation would in practice be satisfactorily metif a period of two years&apos; residence immediately preceeding the election is adopted as the minimum necessary to fulfil the residence qualification mentioned above.[30912]
This requirement would, in their opinion, suffice to secure the election of candidates who were genuinely resident in their various districts, and would effectively prevent the planting out of agents, with a view to their election, bybusiness or other interests in St. John&apos;s or elsewhere. It would, of course, benecessary to make it clear that war service would not be regarded as a break inresidence for this purpose.4. I think that the Commission of Government have made out a good caseon this point, and I propose, therefore, if my colleagues agree, to accept their advice. The geographical basis of election has the great advantage of beingunassailable in democratic theory, and I feel that, with the safeguards mentioned,it should give us the results we desire.5. I have also considered with care the further point which was raised inthe Cabinet as possibly affecting future procedure (paragraph 1 (&amp;) above). Onthis, however, I think it is clear that a change in the Island&apos;s status must be looked upon as a matter for settlement, not by an Imperial Conference, butbetween the people of Newfoundland on the one hand and the United KingdomGovernment and Parliament on the other. We are, in fact, already committed onthis point, since the arrangements made in 1933, as a result of an unanimous vote of both Houses of the Newfoundland Parliament, contemplated only a temporarybreak in the Island&apos;s long history of self-government and provided that, as soonas its difficulties had been overcome, responsible government, on request from thepeople of Newfoundland, would be restored. If, therefore, the people, when theissue is put to them, request the restoration of responsible government, we shall,of course, be bound to accede to their wish, and there would be no scope for reference of the matter to an Imperial Conference. Such a course would, in anycase, be regarded by Newfoundlanders as derogatory, and might well be highlyembarrassing to the Dominions, above all to Canada.6. In the circumstances I now propose, with the approval of my colleagues,to make my proposed statement in the House of Lords at an early convenient opportunity. The draft statement, which was annexed as Appendix A to cp. (45) 234, has been agreed with the Commission of Government, subject to afew minor alterations, and since it has also formed the subject of confidentialconsultation with the Canadian authorities, it would, I feel, be desirable that Tshould adhere as closely as possible to that draft. I annex, however, a shorterdraft which might be suitable for the purpose of a simultaneous statement in theHouse of Commons.A.Dominions Office, S. W. 1,21st November, 1945.
ANNEX.Draft Statement for House of Commons.IN pursuance of the statement of policy made on behalf of the coalition government in December 1943, which they fully endorse, His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have decided to set up in Newfoundland next year, as early as climate conditions permit, an elected National Convention of Newfoundlanders. Elec-tions to the Convention will be held broadly on the basis of the former Parlia-mentary constituencies. All adults will be entitled to vote, and candidates for election will be required to be bona fide residents in the districts they seek torepresent. The Convention will be presided over by a Judge of the SupremeCourt of Newfoundland, and its terms of reference will be as follows : &quot; To consider and discuss amongst themselves, as elected representatives ofthe Newfoundland people, the changes that have taken place in the financialand economic situation of the Island since 1934, and bearing in mind the extentto which the high revenues of recent years have been due to war-time conditions,to examine the position of the country and to make recommendations to HisMajesty&apos;s Government as to possible forms of future government to be put before the people at a national referendum.&quot;In order to assist the Convention, His Majesty&apos;s Government will make available to it when it meets the services of an expert adviser who could giveguidance on constitutional forms and procedure; and they will also prepare foruse of the Convention a factual and objective statement of the Island&apos;s financialand economic situation. This statement will be made available to parliament at the same time.In the meantime it is, of course, most important that the series of reconstruc-tion measures which the Commission of Government already have in hand or are planning to introduce should proceed without interruption, and these willbe pushed forward as rapidly as possible. The Commission have a full pro-gramme designed to meet the more pressing requirements of the Island over thenext two or three years.His Majesty&apos;s Government will make clear to the Convention when it meetstheir own position in relation to possible future financial assistance to the Island.I think it only fair to our fellow-citizens in Newfoundland that I should sounda note of warning on this point. The currency of Newfoundland is the Canadiandollar, and we are now so short of Canadian dollars that the future financing ofimports from Canada essential to the life and welfare of our own people consti-tutes in itself a formidable problem. Our relations with Newfoundland havebeen so special and Newfoundlanders have played such a gallant part in thewar that it would, I know, be the wish of us all to assure to any new Govern-ment which may take over in the Island the fairest possible start. But we mustabove all be careful not to promise what we may not be able to perform, and thespecial difficulties of our financial position over the next few years may wellpreclude us from undertaking fresh commitments on this account.The object of the procedure which His Majesty&apos;s Government propose isto enable the people of the Island to come to a free and informed decision asto their future form of government. I know the House, which has always beensolicitous for their welfare, will wish them well in the exercise of their choice.
