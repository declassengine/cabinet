THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (W) 260.30th October, 1945CABINET.LABOUR CONTROLS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AN urgent decision is required on the immediate future of labour controls.The question was considered at a meeting of the Industrial Sub-Committee of theLord Presidents Committee on the 29th October, on the basis of a report by officials (of which I attach a copy it is well worth study),* and I was asked tobring the issues involved to the notice of the Cabinet.2.   The Industrial Sub-Committee were unanimous upon three points :&apos; (i) Our current labour difficulties cannot be solved unless the release oflabour from the forces is greatly accelerated. We are pledged to release l-i million men and women by the end. of the year and atleast 3 million by the end of June 1946, but all the evidence points to our failing to fulfil our promise unless the Services materiallyspeed up the rate of release between now and Christmas,(ii) In the long run, a proper relationship between the nation&apos;s needs andthe distribution of the labour force can only be secured by a rationaland effective wage policy under which the inducements offered byindustries such as coal-mining and building will be commensurate with their importance to the community. I was asked to arrangefor this question to be fully examined,(iii) Controls over raw materials and production are no effective substitute for labour controls. Though they can help in a limited way (e.g., bypreventing or limiting the manufacture of less essential goods)towards attaining national economic objectives, their operation is necessarily weakened where labour control is withdrawn (see para-graphs 13 (&amp;) and (c) and 26 of the attached report, and paragraph 2of L.P. (45) 210).3. The immediate question is, however, how best to secure the labour we need for essential industries during the next six or nine months. There is nodispute about the necessity of maintaining the Essential Work Orders, which give us an effective means of control over roughly 9 million workers, substantiallyunaltered The Industrial Sub-Committee were unable, however, to reach agree-ment on the future of other forms of labour control, i.e., direction of labour andthe Control of Engagement Order. I set out below the alternative policies betweenwhich, in our opinion, the Cabinet must decide.(i) To maintain the present position whereby labour controls are extensivein theory but severely limited in practice because they are notrigorously enforced (see paragraph 11 of attached report).The following papers are also relevant: L.P. (45) 187 by the Minister of Labour and National Service.L.P. (45) 210 by the President of the Board of Trade and Minister of Supply and aircraft Production.CP. (45) 225 by the Minister of Health and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.CP. (45) 230 by the Minister of Labour and National Service.
(ii) To. release from these controls all workers over the age of 30 (at whichliability to conscription now ceases) but to enforce control on workersbelow that age.(iii) To modify course (ii) by retaining and enforcing controls above theage of 30 in the case of skilled building operatives, coalminers,agricultural workers and nurses (alternative (a) set out in para-graph 25 of the attached report).(iv) To modify course (ii) still further by extending the list of exceptions to other industries of major national importance such as foundries,building materials and components, coal distribution, gas supply and essential food industries, in addition to those mentioned under (iii)above.If Ministers wish to adopt course (iii) or (iv), a decision will alsobe needed on the question whether persons over the age of 30are to be directed between industries as well as within a particular industry.(v) To recognise, and to endeavour actively to persuade the nation torecognise, that if the public need for houses, coal and other essential goods and services is to be met, the whole of the existing system oflabour controls must not only be maintained but effectively enforcedfor a further period (alternative (b) of the attached report).H.

LABOUR CONTROLS.Report by Official Committee.1. In accordance with the conclusions of the Lord Presidents committee at their meeting on the 5th October, 1945,* and of the Lord Presidents(Industrial) Sub-Committee at their meeting on the 11th September, 1945,t wehave examined a memorandum submitted to the Lord Presidents Committee bythe Minister of Labour and National Service (L.P. (45) 187); and have also takeninto account views expressed by the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Supply and Aircraft Production in L.P. (45) 210, with regard to thefuture of the economic controls.2. Ministers have agreedf. that controls should be used with the construc-tive purpose of building up the more essential industries and ensuring that less essential activities do not absorb an undue share of the national resources, andthat, to achieve these ends, &quot; some measure of control over the allocation of labourand other resources as between industries and trades must be maintained; andthat labour, raw materials and production controls should be used as an integrated whole.&quot; In view of the need for an early decision whether labourcontrol should be relaxed as proposed in L.P. (45) 187, we have therefore firstconsidered the degree to which the operation of such a co-ordinated scheme of controls would be affected if such relaxations were made.3.   The labour controls to be considered are as follows : Essential Work Orders.4. These Orders are the most important and effective of the controls.They tie the worker to his job up to age 65 for men and 60 for women, andthey cover about 9 million workers. The Minister proposes to retain theOrders for the time being subject to review of individual firms and industries.Employers formerly engaged on contracts for Supply Departments may nowbe engaged on less essential work and the withdrawal of the Orders would leave workers free to take other employment and so promote mobility oflabour.5. The Minister also proposes to allow individual workers to leave their war-time job and return to their former employment if it is of value to thecommunity. Each case would be considered on its merits as a matter ofadministration. It is not expected that large numbers would be involved and the industries affected would be mainly engineering, aircraft, ship-building and other munitions industries.Directions.6. During the war the power of direction was used mainly to recruitfor the aircraft and munitions industries large numbers of workers from less essential industries and unoccupied persons, particularly women. It was used to a small extent for the transfer of skilled men from one industry toanother where such skill was interchangeable, e.g., building trades craftsmentransferred to shipbuilding.7. After the European War the use of directions was rapidly discon-tinued and, as announced in the White Paper, it was hoped to discontinue its use entirely before the end of the Japanese War. In practice, therefore, thepower is now used only for a narrow range of industries and large classes ofpersons are excluded (paragraph 2 of Appendix I to L.P. (45) 187). It israrely used to direct workers to leave home and in no circumstances is an ex-service man or woman directed away from home. These relaxations havealready been announced.8. The Minister of Labour now proposes to carry relaxations a stage further by confining directions to persons under 30 years of age, with certainpossible exceptions for particular industries.* L.P.

Control of Engagement Order.9. This Order was made after the European War and was intended totake the place of directions during Stage II. Its effect is to require engage-ments of labour to be made through an Employment Exchange up to age 50for men and age 40 for women. The Order also prohibits advertisement. Itwas hoped through the Exchanges to guide labour where it was most needed,In practice, the Order is being disregarded by large numbers of employersand workers, including demobilised ex-service men; and a policy of inspection and prosecution is not. considered practicable or politically desirable. Thereis the further point that the Order cannot be used to keep workers unemployed,and, under present procedure, any worker whom it is not intended to direct to employment is permitted to take the work of his choice after a maximum of seven days.10. The Minister of Labour proposes to regularise the position by lower-ing the age to 30 and trying to enforce the Order for men and women below that age.11. It is clear from the above that the immediate issue on labour controls is mainly confined to the use of the power of directions and to the enforcement ofthe Control of Engagement Order. Further, it is a question not so much of main-taining the existing degree of control, which is already exiguous, but of returning to a more vigorous policy of direction and of enforcement of the Control of engagement Order by the prosecution of employers and workers who enter intoengagements without the approval of the Employment Exchange. The subsequentcomments are therefore based on the assumption (i) that Ministers, in any case, agree to the retention of the Essential WorkOrders for the more essential industries, subject to review of the fieldnow covered and to administrative readjustments. . (We set out, inAppendix A, some special considerations which arise in the caweof the civil service, where administrative relaxations of the scheme ofcontrol may have to be severely limited; and also points that arise inconnection with transport and trawler fishing.)(ii) that the main question on labour controls is whether to accept as inevitablethe limitation of the existing scope of direction and of the Control of engagement Order, and announce relaxations accordingly, or toadopt a more drastic use of existing powers of direction and to try toenforce the Control of Engagement Order up to age 50 for men and40 for women.12. Large numbers of men and women are being released from the forces and from munitions and many will be ready to return to their former employment.Many essential industries have, however, suffered- a reduction in the normalrate of recruitment during the past six years and if all ex-operatives returnedthey would still be below their pre-war strength. Furthermore, their post-warlabour needs are likely in some cases to be in excess of their pre-war strength.13. In order to focus attention on the main issues on which decisions arerequired, we suggest that the following propositions should be accepted: (a) Long-term measures to render more attractive the unpopular essential industries can give little help in meeting the present situation.(&amp;) Steps to discourage the entry of labour into industries such as theengineering industry, where the need for labour is less urgent, willnot of themselves appreciably help the unattractive essential industriesthat are short of labour.(c) Production and raw material controls alone cannot be relied upon to influence directly the flow of labour.14. The next few months will be a period of acute general labour shortage.At the same time large numbers of ex-service men and women and workers from munitions will be free to choose their employment and they will tend to go intothe more attractive industries. It follows that, if the less attractive essential industries are to retain and even expand their labour force, some form of labourcontrol is needed, though the operation of labour controls would have to bebacked up by production and raw material controls.
15. It would seem that there are two main alternative policies that are opento Ministers, with regard to labour controls over the short period of 6-9 months.There are arguments (which we set out below) both for and against eachalternative : in particular, the likely effect of each on production in (or depending on) essential industries needs to be taken into account, together with other factors,both political and psychological.16. On the assumption that it will not be thought desirable to relax control to a greater degree than is proposed by the Minister of Labour in L.P. (45) 187.the first alternative is to make relaxations to that degree (or to a lesser degree by extending the list of exceptions to the general relaxation). The Minister ofLabour proposed relaxation of control in respect of age-groups over 30, withexceptions in the case of skilled building operatives, coal-miners, agriculture and nurses. In support of these proposals, it is maintained that no system of labour controls can be effectively enforced unless supported by general public approval,and that such approval is only likely to be obtained for control over the age of 30(the maximum of call up for military service) in cases of exceptional and obviouspublic need, as for houses and coal, and then only for transfers within an industry.It is also contended that, while these proposals might not lead to such quickresults as a general maintenance of direction for the higher ages, delays in production due to labour troubles would be reduced, and that the more co-operativeatmosphere, coupled with the gathering speed of demobilisation, would help to achieve a satisfactory distribution of man-power at an earlier date than mightbe expected at first sight.17. If a policy of relaxation with certain exceptions is to be adopted,however, there is difficulty in deciding how many exceptions are to be made. Astrong case can be made out and is urged by the Departments concerned for extending the list of exceptions to include, in different degrees, workers in thebuilding materials industries, cotton, iron foundries, jute, wool, flax, boots andshoes, gas undertakings, coal distribution, various food industries and the civilservice; and, if production were the only criterion, the exceptions would be foundto take in a large part of the whole field of industrial employment.18. It has been suggested, and the argument seems to us to have considerableforce, that if a general relaxation is announced, but does not apply to certain industries, the control that remains in the particular cases will be inevitablyweakened. It might well seem to the workers affected that they were subjected todiscrimination merely because their industry was &apos;&apos; unpopular &quot; or in difficulties:this might in itself be expected to lead to a weakening of enforcement, to have abad effect on efforts now being made to popularise the industries concerned, and to cause labour troubles in the very industries where it is most important that theyshould be avoided. This is specially true of coal-mining. The practical argu-ments against an increased number of exceptions are stronger still &apos;(a) The exception of more than two or three well defined industries would beimpossible for the public at large to grasp and remember. The Controlof Engagement Order must depend upon general knowledge and acceptance of the Order by employers and workers, and a patchworkaffair would produce chaos and widespread disregard of the Order.(&amp;) Direction over the age of 30 of other than former workers must carry with it control of engagement for the population generally up to themaximum age of direction. Otherwise Exchanges would have no oneto direct except those who were unwary enough to come to theExchange. Direction of former workers over the age of 30 who arenow in employment would be dependent upon a registration scheme.19. There is the further point that, the more exceptions that are made toa general policy of relaxation, the nearer does the scheme approach to a main-tenance of the existing degree of control, thus largely discounting the psycho-logical advantages of relaxation, while also giving rise to the objections set outin the preceding paragraph.20. If, however, it should be decided that it is nevertheless necessary to relax control now for political reasons, it will be necessary to decide whethercontrol should be exceptionally retained over a wider range of industries thanthat proposed in L.P. (45) 187, and we set out, at paragraph 24 below, the generalviews that Departments have expressed on this point. It is also relevant toconsider whether, if the proposals in L.P.. (45) 187 are adopted, it would be
practicable to take any special steps with a view tq preventing an undue flow of workers into distributive trades: this question has been under discussion between the Ministry of Labour, the Board of Trade and the Ministry of Food,and we append (Appendix B) a note showing the conclusions that have so far been reached.21. The alternative to the course put forward in paragraph 16above is to maiiitain the existing controls) for a further period,to use them more fully, and to take steps to make them effective!This implies deliberate maintenance of a more sfringent system of labourcontrol than is at present being enforced, or than would be readily acceptedby the Trade Unions and the public, while seeking to, make it more acceptableby explanation of the important national aims that it is designed to achieve.Such a system would maintain direction above the age of 30 for a wide range of essential industries other than building and coal-mining, and such direction wouldnot be confined to transfers within an industry. A worker would be liable toprosecution, followed by fine or imprisonment, if he refused to accept directionaway from the trade of his choice or away from home and into, perhaps, worse-paid employment under worse conditions. This would have to apply equally to ex-service men and women who were unemployed or wished to. change theirjob after eight weeks&apos; leave. Only a system on these lines, operated with thefull vigour of wartime by Employment Exchange Officials, could make sure thatman-power resources are distributed so as to fit at once into a general schemefor the distribution of all national resources in the way needed to produce quickresults from a nationally planned economy. It must, however, be recognisedthat, if such a system were to be adopted, with the greatly increased flow oflabour for civilian work when demobilisation from the Forces and release from munitions work have gathered full momentum, it is quite possible that a con-siderable degree of unemployment would develop, as workers would have to bekept unemployed while awaiting essential work that was not immediately avail-able. If this arose to any large extent public outcry might well develop on sucha scale as to undermine the entire system of labour control, and oblige the Govern-ment to make much larger concessions in response to pressure than those that areat present proposed.22. It might be argued that deliberate adoption of this course and acceptanceof the risks that it involves would offer fewer drawbacks than a relaxation madelargely illusory by many exceptions to it, as is suggested at paragraph 19; above.To maintain a scheme of control that has long been in operation might proveeasier than to enforce more than a very few exceptions to a general relaxation.On the other hand, as announcement of relaxation is expected, it may no longer be possible to contemplate that more drastic control should now be introduced and that the present degree of control should continue even for, say, a furthersix months.23. If control were thus continued, political and human factors wouldbe disregarded and, moreover, its enforcement must inevitably depend in thelast resort on public approval (and approval by magistrates and benches) of theGovernment policy, and,. in the view of the Ministry of Labour, such approvalwould not be forthcoming.24. Against this background, we have considered the&apos; views put forward by Departments responsible for the more essential industries. These are, ingeneral terms, as follows : (a) Board of Trade and Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production Industries.It is the view of the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister ofSupply and Aircraft Production (see L.P. (45) 210, paragraph 2) that the listof the special categories, of labour, over the age of 30, to whom the Minister ofLabour would agree to apply the power of direction, should be amplified by addingformer workers in cotton, iron foundries, boots and shoes, jute, wool, flax, and perhaps certain housing fitments industries; and that the use of this power should not be confined to promoting transfers within these industries, but it shouldbe also used to direct former workers back to them. (The, Minister of labour has pointed out, however, in CP. (45) 230, paragraph 3(c), that this type of direction would have to be based on a registration scheme; and that it is doubtfulwhether workers would now respond to a call to register.) The need for retentionof these controls arises because the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Supply and Aircraft Production are satisfied that the loss of direct control over labour over the age of 30 in these industries cannot be made good
by indirect means in the shape of production control on raw material, except to a very limited extent. This need would be met either by extending the Ministerof Labour&apos;s proposals in L.P. (45) 187 as suggested, or equally, by continuingexisting controls for the time being as at paragraph 21 above. If, however, theproposals in L.P. (45) 187 are accepted without modification, the desired increaseill production of the following items is likely to be immediately and adversely affected : clothing, furnishing fabrics, carpets, linoleum, gas and electric cookers,baths, stoves, and many kinds of machinery.(b) Coal, coal distribution, gas, electricity.To meet the labour situation in the coal, coal distribution and gas industries,the Minister of Fuel and Power considers that existing powers of labour controlmust be continued for a further six months, after which relaxations in the caseof coal distribution and gas, but not coal-mining, might be again considered.(It is not thought that immediate relaxation in the case of the electricity supply industry would have any serious consequences.) The Minister feels that thespecial problem of the coal mines (which are, in effect, the base of the wholeinverted pyramid of industry) justifies almost by itself the continuance of all existing labour controls in full for the next six months. There is no general wageclaim outstanding in the industry, and no possibility of any substantial improVe-ment in working conditions except on a long-term basis. The problem of this industry is simply that, for many reasons, it is thoroughly and universally un-popular; thus any step, such as excepting it from relaxation of control (eventhough certain Other industries are also excepted) which has the effect of throwingits unattractiveness into still higher relief might well prove to be the &quot; laststraw,&quot; and result in grave unrest in the industry during the coming winter, andpossibly even large-scale stoppages. These, in turn, might well hold up thewhole work of national reconstruction.(c) Building and Civil Engineering.The Minister of Labour proposes in L.P. (45) 187 that building operativesmay have to be excluded from certain relaxations of labour control. The Ministerof Works supports this proposal and suggests that the present degree of controlover labour in the building and civil engineering industries should at least bemaintained and, moreover, that direction should be enforced more firmly than inthe past. It is necessary to provide a safeguard under the Control of EngagementOrder against the drift of building and civil engineering workers to .otherindustries in respect of men up to 50; and the Control of Engagement order should also continue to apply to all men up to 50 within the industry to see that labour goes to the most important jobs. The Minister also considers thatdirections should continue to be issued to men up to 50 with previous experience in the building and civil engineering industries (either those who have speciallyregistered or those who visit the Ministry of Labour Offices to apply for work) inorder both to build up the total labour force and to secure the proper distributionof labour within the industry. If it should be found impossible to exercise these controls up to the age of 50, direction away from home might only apply to menunder 40. The existing Essential Work Order and the Restriction on TransferOrder should remain in force.(d) Building materials industries.The attention of Ministers has already been drawn to the labour shortages in these industries in a memorandum by the Minister of Health and the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (45) 225), who proposed (at paragraph 8 (c)) :(i) that ex-operatives who have left the building materials and componentindustries since the 3rd September, 1939, should be compulsorily withdrawnfrom their present employment and directed back to their former employment;(ii) that workers in other industries who would be suitable for employment inthe building materials and components industries should be withdrawn from theirpresent employment and directed to those industries; (iii) that men over thethe age of 30 should be directed as at (i) and (ii), and that the powers shouldbe used to the full, including prosecution if necessary. The Minister of labour is opposed (see CP. (45) 230, paragraph 2) to this extended use of compulsory powers At their meeting on the 15th October, 1945, the Cabinet agreed that theproposal at paragraph 8 (c) or CP. (45) 225 should be considered by the lord presidents Committee (CM. (45) 41st Conclusions, Minute 1, Conclusion (5)).If a policy of relaxation of labour control is adopted, with exceptions in thecase of certain industries, there can be no doubt that the building materials and
component industries can claim a high place in any list of such exceptions, inview of repercussions on the housing programme. The Minister of Workspresses very strongly for this and for the retention of the existing labour controlsin the building materials industries up to the age of 50. In particular, thearrangements should provide not only for a redistribution of workers within these industries, but for the direction of suitable operatives from other industries to the building materials industries.Not only is there need for this immediate action, but the Minister considersit is also necessary to avoid relinquishing any powers or giving any undertakings which would make it more difficult to introduce a very drastic measure of directioninto the building materials industries in two or three months&apos; time if it were tobecome evident that demobilisation from the Forces and releases from the munitions industries were not going to provide the very large further recruitment to building materials that is essential if the housing programme is to be carriedout. If such a situation arose, directions on a far more drastic scale than atpresent would be needed.(e) Agriculture.Before the war there was a considerable drift of agricultural workers fromthe land to other industries which offered higher wages and better conditions ofemployment. During the war this movement was prevented first by theRestriction on Engagement Order and subsequently (as regards men up to theage of 50 and women up to the age of 40) under the Control of Engagement Order.Under these Orders agricultural workers have not been allowed to take upemployment outside the agricultural industry. In England and Wales, however,agriculture is not scheduled under the Essential &quot;Work Order.If the Minister of Labour&apos;s proposal is adopted to reduce to 30 the upperage limit in the Control of Engagement Order, agricultural workers above thatage will be free to seek other employment. Although agricultural wages are nowconsiderably higher than before the war and accommodation difficulties mightprevent any large movement of agricultural workers, there can be no doubt thata considerable number of agricultural workers could leave the land. Moreover,the workers concerned would include the most skilled and experienced workersin the industry.The present food production programme is already jeopardised by theshortage of skilled labour as the Minister of Agriculture has recently explained in CP. (45) 193. A loss of skilled workers at this stage would, in his view,inevitably lead to a fall in home production, particularly in the dairy industrywhere the shortage of skilled workers has already resulted in a decrease in the dairy herd during the past twelve months. The Minister of Agriculture there-fore wishes that steps should be taken to retain in the industry,-for the present atleast, all male workers up to the age of 50. It must, however, be recognised that,in the last resort, this would involve direction of experienced agricultural workers up to that age.(f) Industries ancillary to agriculture.The Minister of Labour proposed (in L.P. (45) 187) that workers aged 30and over should normally be given permission to leave a scheduled undertakingif they wished to return to their peace-time work, and that work was of value to the community. Several of the industries on which agriculture is dependentare scheduled, though agriculture itself is not. These industries include catch-ment and drainage boards/the seed trade and undertakings manufacturing and repairing&apos;agricultural machinery. So long as home food production is to continue at its war-time levels, the Minister of Agriculture considers it essential that theoutput of these ancillary industries should also be maintained.Any loss of skilled workers would be particularly serious in the agricul-tural engineering industry owing to the reduction in imports of machinery dueto the cancellation of Lease-Lend. This industry is already unable to fulfil its programmes on account of labour difficulties. The Minister of Agriculturetherefore suggests that it should be recognised, if relaxations in labour control are to be made, that it will be impossible for any considerable number of men aged 30 and over to be released from undertakings in these industries for thetime being.(g) Food.A number of vital food and distributive industries, and industries ancillaryto food production, are relatively ill-paid, or are unattractive to workers coming
oUt of the Forces or munitions industry because of unpleasant conditions of work or lack of reasonable amenities. Relaxations in the administration of controlsthat have already been made have caused difficulties in this connection, and itmay be expected that, if further relaxations are made, these difficulties will increase. If political considerations could be left out of account, the Ministerof Food would therefore wish for effective controls to be maintained at least inthose industries that experience has shown to need the sanction of directions ifthey are to maintain an adequate labour force. Should relaxations, however,be made, it is thought that urgent consideration should be given to those trades which are unattractive to workers. Many of these are only being carried on atpresent by the use of military or prisoner-of-war labour.Conclusions.25. On the issue of the immediate future of labour controls our conclusions are as follows.   Ministers will have to consider two courses :-(a) to accept in principle that further relaxations in labour controls cannotbe any longer delayed, and thus to accept the Minister of Laboursproposals in L.P. (45) 187 subject to any modification that may bethought essential and practicable in respect of the industries notedunder the preceding paragraph. There are, however, narrow prac-tical limits to the exceptions to the proposed relaxations. Formerworkers could only be directed back to their old employment afterregistration, and a registration scheme is not likely to be effective.Furthermore, if it was decided to direct workers from other industriesinto such industries as the food and building materials industries, itwould be necessary to retain general control as in alternative (b).(b) to decide that it is practicable, despite the obvious political and other difficulties, to obtain the necessary measure of public assent to a policytantamount to the conscription of labour, and accordingly to make norelaxations for a further period of, say, six months when the position might be reviewed again, in the meantime making more effective useof the power of directions and endeavouring to enforce the Controlof Engagement Order.26. It must be made clear that, if course (a) is adopted, this means that labour, raw materials and production controls can only to a very limited degreedirect the flow of resources into particular industries. Other controls are nosubstitute for labour controls, and their operation is necessarily weakened wherelabour control is withdrawn; they can, howTever, help in a limited way towardsattaining the national objectives of housing, coal, exports, control of inflation, &amp;c.The maintenance even of strict labour control up to the age of 30 will be inade-quate, in the view of the Departments concerned with a number of essential industries, to secure the production results required.27. If the manifest human and political difficulties in the way of course(b) could be overcome and they might well prove to be so serious as to jeopardiseenforcement of even minimum labour control there can be little doubt that thenational objectives would be more certainly attained, and in any case attainedsooner; and it would be more likely that production programmes, to which theGovernment is committed, would be fulfilled, and to time.28.   We suggest, therefore, that Ministers will need to decide :- -(i) whether course (a) or course (b) in paragraph 25 above should be adopted,(ii) if course (a), whether it will be practicable to except from the relaxationproposed by the Minister of Labour all or any of the industries men-tioned under paragraph 24 above, in addition to the exceptions alreadyproposed (viz., coal-miners, skilled building operatives, experiencedagricultural workers and nurses); and whether, in the case of all orany of the industries so excepted, direction should be maintained overthe age of 30 to transfer workers to them from other industries.Signed on behalf of the Official Committee,J.

APPENDIX B.Flow of Labour into Retail Distribution.I. Size of the Problem.Between May 1944 and May 1945, the total labour force in these tradesincreased by 32,000; during July and August 1945 it increased by a further20,000. There is some risk, particularly with regard to women, that distributive trades will absorb more labour than would be justified in the national interest:but the extent of the risk should not be exaggerated.II. Need for Special Measures.The Ministry of Food consider that, having regard to the importance ofincreasing the number of workers in the food distributive trades, the proposalsfor control of labour in L.P. (45) 187 would provide a sufficient safeguard. TheBoard of Trade, however, consider that further measures are needed.APPENDIX A.(a) Civil Service.The existing control over temporary civil servants is embodied in the Controlof Employment (Civil Servants) Order 1945, which prevents these officers from leaving their employment except with the consent of the National Service Officer.Out of a total number of 667,000 non-industrial civil servants, no less than 466,000are temporaries, the great bulk of whom are over 30 years of age. A number of departments are already in great difficulty in maintaining essential services andsome of them are overwhelmingly dependent on temporary staff. For instance,98 per cent, of the total staff of the Ministry of Food are&apos; temporary. It is not easy to assess the effect of the relaxation of control, but it is certain that therewould be serious danger of breakdown in some places. The Post Office, for instance,are particularly anxious about the maintenance of the work of the Savings Depart-ment, which has already been in great difficulty; apart from the normal work ofthis Department, the maintenance of which is essential, it is concerned in thepayment of demobilisation benefits.The danger of relaxation is particularly acute in the case of certain specialistand technical staffs (e.g., architectural and engineering draughtsmen, quantitysurveyors, &amp;o, employed in the Ministry of Works). The Inland Revenue arecertain that relaxation would mean the loss of considerable numbers of theirexpert valuers, who are only held by the enforcement of the present Order; thesemen are needed for essential work in connection with housing and the duties ofthe Ministry of Town and Country.Planning.If a real risk of breakdown of some essential services and of serious delay in execution of a number of most important reconstruction plans is to be avoided, theTreasury consider that provision should be made for continuance of the order for the time being, at any rate in some Departments and in some Civil Servicegrades.(b) Transport.In the view of the Minister of War Transport it would be unwise at thisstage to withdraw the protection which is now afforded by the Essential Work-Orders. The maintenance of existing services, both for passenger and goods,depends on a sufficient labour force, and in view of the many burdens whichtransport will have to meet during the coming winter, there is serious risk thata substantial number of transport workers would be lost whose places would not immediately be taken,(c) Trawler Fishing.During the next few months it is expected that there will be a very serious shortage of trawler hands to man the trawlers being released from Naval service which are now being reconditioned for fishing. In these circumstances, theMinister of Agriculture considers that it will be necessary to retain the existingcontrol under the Essential Work Order,
III. Possible Measures.(a) To impose labour ceilings making it an offence for an employer to employ more than a stated number of workers. Detailed consideration ofa proposal to apply a scheme of this kind to certain manufacturing industriesled to the conclusion that difficulties of administration and of enforcementwould make it unworkable. Consideration of a similar proposal with regardto the distributive trades led to the same conclusion.(b) To amend the Control of Engagement Order to provide that noemployer in retail distributive trade may engage a worker between the ages of 18 and 50 otherwise than through the Ministry of Labour.Considerations arising here are :  (i) Decision would be needed whether this proposal should apply to food distribution trades as well as to retail distributive trades in general.It is thought that it would have to apply to both, because of thenumber of combined shops selling both food and other goods.(ii) Strong resentment would be caused in the retail trade and very likely strong public criticism also if food trades were included.Administrative arrangements to assist in placing workers in foodshops would probably not avoid this.(iii) To make such an Order fully effective, in the last resort workers between30 and 50 whom it was desired to keep out of retail distribution wouldhave to be directed to other work. The alternative would be to keepsuch workers unemployed.(iv) Such an Order might have some useful effect through bringing powersof persuasion at Labour Exchanges to bear. It would, however, bedifficult to get satisfactory results from prosecutions of - employers or workers breaking the Order. Though the persuasion might be valuable, the control leading to it would in the last resort be virtuallyunenforceable.In the light of these considerations, the Ministry of Labour do not feel thatsuch a proposal can be accepted.(c) To employ some other means, for example, limitations on the value ofgoods sold. It is not thought that such a proposal would be practicable or that it would have the desired result.
