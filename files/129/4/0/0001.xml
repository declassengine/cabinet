-      4THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   October 1945.SECRET. Copy No.  fjQCP. (35) 251.2%th October, 1945.CABINET.THE DODECANESE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.ON the 19th September I circulated a note on the Dodecanese (CP. (45) 182)in which I suggested that if no decision was reached at the Council of foreign ministers the de facto administration of the Islands should be handed over to greece. I consider that the time has now come to act on this proposal and i suggest that a telegram should be despatched to Athens on the lines of the draft annexed. At the same time, His Majesty&apos;s Embassy in Washington would be instructed to inform the State Department of our proposed announcement. Ido not anticipate that they will raise any objection, since I mentioned our intention in general terms to Mr. Byrnes while he was here and he did not demur.The Turkish Government should also be informed just before the declarationis made.2. The Chiefs of Staff and the War Office have expressed their concurrence in the draft telegram, and I have taken steps to inform the dominions governments of our intentions.E. B.Foreign Office,2Qth October, 1945.ANNEX.Draft Telegram to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Athens.Council of Foreign Ministers ended without having reached any decision about the future of the Dodecanese. I am fully aware of the disappointmentwhich this will cause in Greece, and His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly decided that de facto administration of the islands should immediately be handedover to the Greek Government. The following announcement will accordingly be published here at on .   Please inform GreekGovernment at once : &quot; The Dodecanese islands have been under British military administra-tion since the Germany surrender. This has been a temporary arrangementpending a decision as to the future status of the islands.&quot; The question of the future of the Dodecanese was discussed at theCouncil of Foreign Ministers in London. No final decision was taken, but none of the Governments represented expressed any opposition to cession ofthe islands to Greece.&quot;In these - circumstances His Majesty&apos;s Government do not feel itnecessary to maintain British military government in the islands, and they accordingly propose to make immediate arrangements with the GreekGovernment for the latter to assume de facto administration of the dodecanese, pending a final decision by the United Nations.&quot;12994   [30763]
