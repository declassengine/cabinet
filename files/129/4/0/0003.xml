(i5) 253.2$th October, 1945.CABINET.PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.FIRST REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON PROCEDURE.Memorandum by the Lord President ; of the Council.1. The Select Committee have now reported, as they were directed to do,,on those parts of the Government Memorandum which relate to the acceleration of proceedings on Public Bills. Their report, which reprints the government memorandum, is annexed hereto, together with a detailed comparison between their proposals and those of the Memorandum.2. It will be seen that in substance the Select Committee endorse the schemeput to them. Two minor proposals (Nos. 8 and 10 in the attached comparison)are rejected and two others (Nos. 12 and 13) are deferred : but the most importantfeatures of the plan (viz., that virtually all Bills should be sent upstairs, thatStanding Committees should be increased in number and reduced in size, should sit for longer and more often, should be enabled to sit in the afternoon if necessary,and should have their proceedings subject if necessary to a guillotine) are all, inone form or another, accepted.3. I need only add the following comments (the references are to theproposals as numbered in the attached comparison) : No. 2. Official Reporters: It is suggested that the present rates ofealary make further recruitment impossible. I understand that salarieswere substantially increased a year ago to meet this point and that noproposals for further increases have since been made. However, the Reportersmust be found.Accommodation. This is a real difficulty which must be urgentlyexamined.A ttendance of Law Officers. The Select Committee tentatively suggest the appointment of a third English Law Officer. The Machinery of Govern-ment Committee under the Coalition Government considered two otherexpedients which did not find their way into the final memorandum : (a) The Law Officers should be enabled to attend and speak in anyStanding Committee.(b) In view of the well-known method of obstruction, by which in theabsence of a Law Officer innumerable points are raised purporting to require authoritative legal explanations, Committee Chairmanmight be given power to suspend discussion on any such pointuntil a Law Officer can be present.I suggest that these two expedients might now be favourablyconsidered, but I&apos; do not favour an additional Law Officer.No. 5.   We can hardly object to the Select Committee&apos;s modification.No. 6.  The Select Comm.ittee&apos;s elaboration seems to me an improvement.[30764]
No. 7. One of the advantages of the original proposal for an EmergencyBusiness Committee was that it would secure a body commanding the respect ofall Parties which might be very useful in helping to secure agreed time-tableson the Floor of the House as well as upstairs. The Select Committee&apos;s alter-native secures substantially all that was aimed at in respect of proceedingsupstairs, but does not meet the point about the Floor of the House. However,I do not think it worth pressing the original proposals in the face of theSelect Committee&apos;s objections; indeed, as a whole I think the Committee&apos;sproposals are an improvement.4. On items 8 and 10, where the Committee reject the governments proposals, and item 11, where they agree subject to a reservation, I should not wish to die in the last ditch, but I should like to take some soundings before i finally commit myself, and I hope that my colleagues may be prepared to leaveme a little latitude.5. Subject to this proviso, I therefore suggest that the Government should accept the Select Committee&apos;s modifications of the proposals put to them. before a statement is made, I would propose as a matter of courtesy to consultMr. Speaker in case he has any comments on the Report: two of the points raised(Official Reporters and accommodation) are his peculiar concern.6. If early advantage is to be taken of the changes approved by the SelectCommittee, the necessary steps should be set in motion without delay. I suggestthat in my statement on Business next Thursday I should indicate that therewill be a debate the following week, when both the Report and the proposed amendments of the Standing Orders should be dealt with. The necessary amendments to Standing Orders should be put down as early as possible.7. I therefore seek the authority of my colleagues, as a matter of urgency,to proceed on the lines indicated in this Memorandum.H. M.Office of the Lord President, S.W. 1,2Qth October, 1945.

FIRST REPORT&quot;A The Select Committee appointed to consider the Procedure in the public business of this House and to report what alterations, if any, are desirable for the more efficient despatch of such business, have made progress in thematters to them referred and have agreed to the following First Report.I. Introduction..i. Your Committee were instructed to report as soon as possible upon any scheme for the acceleration of proceedings on Public Bills which might besubmitted to them on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government. In order to carryo&apos;ut the Instruction with due expedition Your Committee have in this the first part of their inquiry confined themselves to considering and reporting on thescheme which is set out in the Appendix, and the evidence which they tookwas similarly restricted. Thus the present Report is concerned solely withthat scheme. Your Committee desire at the outset to emphasise the limitedcharacter of the present Report and to make it clear that it is made withoutprejudice to any wider proposals for the reform of Parliamentary procedure-which they may later recommend.I 2. Evidence was given by: the Right Hon. Douglas Clifton Brown, speaker of the House of Commons; the Right Hon. Herbert Morrison, Lord Presidentof the Council; the Right Hon. James Stuart, Chief Opposition Whip; SirGilbert.Campion, K.C.B., Clerk of the House of Commons; Sir GranvilleRam, K.C.B., K.C., First Parliamentary Counsel to the Treasury; and Mr.P. F. Cole, Editor of the Official Report.Origin of the Scheme.3. Before considering the details of the scheme it may be as well to recallthe circumstances of its origin. In the words of the Government memorandum;&quot; The scheme was originally drafted by a committee of Ministers of the coalition Government, but it did not, at any time, receive the approval ofthe War Cabinet and the members of the War Cabinet are not in any way committed to it. The present Government, whilst not thinking it right to commit itself at this stage, feels that the scheme covers a number of proposalswhich are eminently worthy of consideration by the Select Committee and form a useful basis from which the Committee may commence its discussions.&quot;Purpose and character of the Scheme.4. The scheme was conceived to meet the special circumstances of theperiod of transition from war to peace. It was assumed that, whatever party should be in power at that time, a heavy programme of legislation would beurgently required for the purposes of reconstruction, and that it would notbe possible to put through such a programme under the normal conditionsof Parliamentary procedure in the course of one or two sessions. The schemetherefore suggests certain modifications of Parliamentary procedure &quot; whichihight be given a trial, on an experimental basis, during the first one or twosessions after the end of hostilities in Europe &quot;.. Your Committee desire todraw attention to the experimental character of the proposals submitted bythe Government and to emphasise that it is on this basis that they have con-sidered them. It would follow that any alterations in the Orders governing the procedure of the House which the adoption of these proposals may requirewould take the form of Sessional Orders during the experimental period.45870 A 2
II.   Proposals for Expediting the Committee Stage of Bills.5. The scheme submitted by the Government deals in the main with theCommittee stage of Bills. The remaining proposals are concerned with variousminor suggestions in regard to financial procedure. The proposals relatingto the Committee stage of Bills fall under five main heads:  (1) That substantially all bills should be referred to Standing Committees;(2) That the number of Standing Committees should be increased, their size being reduced, if necessary, for the purpose;(3) That the number of hours devoted to the sittings of Standing Com-mittees &quot;should be substantially increased over the pre-war minimum standard of four hours per week; . .(4) That machinery should be prepared for prescribing and enforcinga time limit on the proceedings in Standing Committee; and&apos; (5) That certain minor amendments should be made in the procedure and practice in the debates in Committee.First Proposal: That substantially all Bills should be referred to a StandingCommittee.   (Paragraph 5.)6. Standing Order No. 46 prescribes that &quot; when a Bill has been read asecond time it shall stand committed to one of the Standing Committees, unlessthe House, on motion to be decided without amendment or debate, other-wise order &apos;&apos;.   The Order excepts:  (a) Bills for imposing taxes or Consolidated Fund or Appropriation Bills;and(b) Bills for confirming Provisional Orders.To these two classes the Government proposals would in practice add three other classes:  (c) Any Bill which it may be necessary to pass with great expedition;(d) &quot; One Clause &quot; Bills not requiring detailed examination in Com-mittee; and(e) Bills &quot;of first-class constitutional importance &quot;.The Government would of course retain the right to move that the Com-mittee stage of any important Bill should be taken on the floor of the House,.if in the circumstances of the individual case that course seemed preferable.7. Your Committee approve this proposal which, as explained, would represent a fuller use than hitherto of a procedure for which the standing order already provides. In view of the conflict of evidence they considerthat it is not posssible to estimate precisely how many days of the time ofthe House would be saved by this proposal.. This question is more appro-priate to the larger inquiry into the use of Parliamentary time which theCommittee will make later. They are, however, satisfied, that in the circum-stances likely to obtain in the next few years it would result in an acceleration of Public Business, despite the fact that some increase in time may berequired on Second Reading and at the Report stage.Second Proposal: That the -number of Standing Committees should beincreased, their size being reduced, if necessary for the purpose. (Para-graph 10.)8. Standing Order No. 47 lays down that not more than five Standing(Committees (including the Scottish) shall be appointed. This number isconsidered in the Government scheme to be insufficient to deal with the
amount of legislation which is likely to be needed, and it is proposed toincrease it. Your Committee agree that as many Standing Committees shouldbe appointed as are necessary expeditiously to dispose of the Bills comingup from the House, and they see no procedural reason for retaining the limit atpresent fixed by Standing Order No. 47 (1). The difficulties are entirely on the practical side. (See memoranda by the Clerk of the House and the editor of the Official Report.) Your Committee are in entire sympathy withthe intention expressed in the Government scheme to allow none of the difft-culties of providing clerks, reporters and accommodation to stand in the way.This is not the place to discuss the solution of these difficulties, but theCommittee feel bound to record the view of the Editor of the Official Report,that in existing circumstances he could see his way to provide for only four Committees, and that at the present rate of salary it would not bepossible to recruit more reporters of the very high standard required. Inthe opinion of Your Committee no question of salary should be allowed to stand in the way of securing the necessary number of skilled reporters.Additional clerks will be required and steps must be taken to provide them.As regards accommodation, Your Committee, though aware of the difficulties,are strongly of opinion that all Standing Committees should sit in the precinctsof the Palace of Westminster. -9. One other difficulty ought to be mentioned. If six Standing Com-mittees in addition to the Scottish were sitting concurrently, the Law Officersof the Crown of whom there are at present two, apart from the Scottish, wouldbe in some difficulty in performing their duties in regard to the conduct of bills. A partial solution of this difficulty might perhaps be found in theappointment of a third Law Officer. This, however, is a matter for theGovernment rather than Your Committee.10. On the question whether an increase in the number of Standing Com-mittees would involve a decrease in the number of Members serving on each,the Government proposals express the opinion that it would not necessarilydo so, but that, if difficulties arose in securing the necessary numbers, thereduction should be in the permanent nucleus rather than in the numbersadded in respect of a particular Bill (under the existing Standing order no. 48, not less than 10 nor more than 35). Your Committee concur withthis view and recommend the reduction of the permanent nucleus to 20with the addition of not more than 30 Members in respect of a Bill, making atotal of 50. - For a Standing Committee of this size Your Committee considera quorum of 15 would be sufficient. The constitution and quorum of theScottish Committee should remain as at present.Third Proposal: That the number of hours devoted to the sittings of standing committees should be substantially increased over the pre-war minimum standard of four hours per week.   (Paragraph 7.)11. The Government scheme contains three suggestions designed to increasethe hours of sitting of Standing Committees:  -(a) That Standing Committees should normally meet for a period of2-h hours, instead of two as hitherto;(b) That Standing Committees should meet three days a week; and(c) That the former Standing Order No. 49A should be revived; &quot;-so thatStanding Committees could sit in the afternoon when necessary, as well asin the morning.  (See below, paragraph 15.)45870 A 3
(a) That Standing Committees should normally sit for a period of 2\ hours.12. Your Committee approve this proposal. They recommend that Stand-ing Committees should sit from 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. This, however, cannotbe done unless the staff of reporters is suitably increased.(b) That Standing Committees should sit three days a. week.13. In Sessions 1919 to 1939 Standing Committees sat on an average of95 days in a session, the highest total being in 1930-31, when five standing committees sat on 152 days. Quite clearly this total might be considerably-increased. On the assumption that seven Standing Committees (including theScottish) were appointed, it would be possible, in theory at least, in a normalsession of 30 weeks for them to sit a total of 420 days. If, however, it isregarded as impracticable fully to employ seven Standing Committees in theperiod before Christmas, because enough Bills would not be ready, it wouldbe possible, if they sat regularly in the - remaining 20 weeks of the session,for them to sit not less.than 280 days in all. The addition of half an hourto each of these sittings, as proposed in the previous paragraph, would raise this figure by 25 per cent., to the equivalent of 350&apos; days on the old two-hourbasis. That is to say, if seven Standing Committees were appointed andsat regularly from Christmas to the Summer Recess, they would ibe able to accomplish about three and a half times as much work as has been donein Standing Committees on an average in the past, or about two and one-thirdtimes the amount in the heaviest recorded Session. It would thus appearthat, on the existing basis of two sittings a week, increased by the proposedadditional half hour, there would be time to deal with any volume of bills which could be put through their other stages on the floor of the House.14. The Lord President of the Council made it clear that the possibilityof greatly increasing the output of Standing Committees depends on a steadysupply of Bills, and Your Committee recognise that amid the changes andchances of political life it may not always be possible to maintain such a steady&apos; flow, with the result that from time to time there will be blockagesin the Standing Committees. In such circumstances it would be necessaryfor Standing Committees to sit three days a week. It has never been easy to get Standing Committees to meet on Wednesdays on account of the regularuse of that day for party meetings, and attendance- on a Committee on threeconsecutive mornings imposes a considerable strain upon the Minister who inaddition to being in charge of the Bill has his ordinary Departmental duties to discharge. For these reasons Your Committee consider that the proposal that Standing Committees should sit three days a week should be regardedas an expedient to relieve congestion, rather than as a normal practice, andthat the arrangement of sittings (after the first, which by custom is fixed by the Chairman) should continue as heretofore to be &quot;the right of eachStanding Committee.(c) That the former Standing Order No. 49A should be revived.15. The former Standing Order No. 49A provided for the adjournment of the House after Questions to enable Standing Committees to sit concur-rently in the afternoon. It is a disadvantage of this proposal that it would reduce the time in which the House usually sits and therefore deprive theGovernment of some of the time which the scheme is intended to save. Thisdisadvantage would, however, be outweighed in the situation contemplated inthe Governments proposal, i.e., &quot; if a situation arises where there is a dangerof a blockage upstairs while time is relatively easy on the floor of the House.&quot;Your Committee accordingly recommend the revival of the powers given by
S.O. No. 49A. They are, however, concerned that there should be no furtherinroad into the already severely curtailed time available for Private members to raise matters. This could be secured in either of two ways. Either the half-hour adjournment could be taken immediately after -Questions and anyMinisterial or personal statement, so that Standing Committees could meetfrom 4.30 to 7 p.m. and for a further period in the evening if necessary; or.alternatively, the House could be adjourned until 7.15 p.m. (6.15 p.m. if an adjournment motion under S.O. No. 8 had been granted). The latter alterna-tive would give two hours in which the Government could do business or private Members&apos; motions could be taken and would preserve the right ofPrivate Members to the half-hour adjournment at the usual time. Your(Committee recommend that the powers given by the former S.O. No. 49Ashould be revived so as to permit the adjournment of the House in either ofthese two ways.Fourth Proposal: That machinery should be prepared, for prescribing andenforcing a time limit on the proceedings in Standing Committees. (Para-graphs 8 and 9.)16. The scheme proposes that in any case where it is essential to obtainthe report of a Bill within a given time, the proceedings in Committee shouldbe governed by a special type of guillotine resolution. This resolution, towhich the House would have to agree, would specify the time to be allowed for each of the stages of the Bill, but would not subdivide the stages. Thelatter function would be the work of a special committee, to be called theEmergency Business Committee, which would consist of the members of the chairmen&apos;s Panel together with perhaps five additional members nominated by Mr. Speaker.i   17. Your Committee have given careful consideration to this proposal.While they recognise that circumstances are likely to.arise in which it willI be necessary to prescribe a time limit upon the proceedings in a StandingCommittee, they do not consider that the method proposed is the best calcu-i lated to achieve the result.   They were much impressed by the criticisms of the Clerk of the House.   These may be stated briefly.   First, the main valuei of the proposal is for the Committee stage of Bills, that being the only stagei capable of elaborate subdivision.   Secondly, it would provide for a second&apos;;opportunity of debate, viz., upon the report of the Emergency Business Com-committee-unless provision were made for the agreement of the House to that!Committee&apos;s report without amendment or debate.     This might result inIsaving the time of the House at the expense of good relations in the Standing1 Committee and might lead after the first experience to lengthy debates on^guillotine motions in respect of subsequent Bills.   Finally, it would not be aIgood  thing   that   the   Chairmen,   who   would   constitute   so   large   a&quot;part    of    the    proposed    Committee,    should    be    identified    with[decisions which could hardly be challenged on any other ground than that theywere unfair to some section of the critics of a Bill.   For these reasons YouriCommittee recommend that, where the Government wish to prescribe a time--firnit in respect of the proceedings in a Standing Committee, the guillotine&apos;inoiion should take the form of naming a date by which the Bill should be reported; and that the detailed allocation of sittings of the Standing Committeeto parts of the Bill should be the work of a.Sub-Committee of the StandingCommittee, to consist of the Chairman and seven other Members to be nominated by Mr. Speaker.   The advantages of such a proposal are twofold,first, the work of detailed allocation would be in the hands of persons whoWs members of the Standing Committee concerned would in any case have
to make a study of the Bill. Secondly, the necessity of a second reference tothe House, with or without the opportunity of debate, would be avoided, andthe approval of the scheme would be left to the body which, as having to work under it, would be primarily concerned, namely, the Standing Committee.18. If this proposal were adopted, the main purpose of the EmergencyBusiness Committee to draw up a time table for proceedings in StandingCommittee would disappear, since the Second and Third -Reading stages ofa Bill are not divisible, and the Report stage is only divisible to a minorextent and in fairly obvious ways. Your Committee therefore consider that a central Emergency Business Committee is unnecessary; and that, if an alloca-tion of time is considered necessary for the Committee stage, of any of the few Bills which under the scheme may be referred to a Committee of thewhole House and for the- Report stage of any Bills, the details should be embodied in the guillotine motion as heretofore.Fifth Proposal: That certain minor amendments should be made in the pro-cedure and practice in the debate in Committee.   (Paragraph n.)(a) That if a clause has been amended, debate should not be permitted,on the clause unless the Chairman is of opinion, that the principle of theclause, or any substantial point arising thereon, has not been adequatelydiscussed.19. The principle upon which this suggestion is based appears to apply withequal force in those cases where, though the clause has not been amended, themain points have been discussed upon amendments proposed. Your Com-mittee do not, however, consider the proposal either desirable or necessary.It would place upon the Chairman the onus of deciding whether the clause asa whole as distinct from its parts, or as modified by amendment, had been adequately discussed. Under the existing Standing Orders he alreadypossesses adequate power to check repetition.(b) That fuller use should be made of the practice by which the minister in charge of a Bill circulates to the Committee notes on any clauses whichare not readily understood without explanation.20. Your Committee approve this suggestion. Insofar as the notes do infact clarify the meaning of the clause, they might do something to obviatethe movement of amendments to obtain explanations from the Minister incharge of the Bill.III. Proposed Minor Changes in Financial Procedure on Bills.(Paragraph 13.)(1) That on the Report stage of a Financial Resolution the question shouldbe put without amendment or debate.21. Under the existing practice the House only very rarely discusses a financial Resolution on Report. The saving of time by the adoption of thisproposal would therefore be negligible. On the other hand, it is .of some importance that, where the Government have amended the Resolution, theHouse should have an opportunity of discussing it in the amended form.Your Committee do not therefore recommend any alteration of the existing practice.(2) That the rule which prevents two stages of a Financial Resolution beingtaken on the same day should be abandoned.22. Your Committee see no objection to this suggestion, so long as theright of any Member to object to the taking of both stages on the same day is preserved.
(3) That the rule under which a Financial Resolution is needed to coverprovisions of a Bill requiring money to be paid into the Exchequer shouldbe abolished.(4) That the rule, that any new clause or amendment is out of order on reportif it creates or imposes a charge on the public revenue or imposes orextends any tax, rate or other local burden, or varies the incidence ofany such charge or burden^ should be abolished in so far as it extend to rates or other local burdens.23. Your Committee consider that these two suggestions would more appro-appropriately be dealt with in the course of their later inquiries.IV.   Summary.24. Your Committee&apos;s conclusions may be summarised as follows:  (a) Your Committee approve the proposal to refer substantially all bills to Standing Committees.    (Paragraph 7.)(b) As many Standing Committees should be appointed as are necessaryexpeditiously to dispose of the Bills coming up from the House. (Para-graph 8.)(c) The permanent nucleus of Standing Committees (other than theScottish) should be reduced to 20 and not more 30 Members should beadded in respect of a Bill; and the quorum should be 15.   (Paragraph 10.)(d) Standing Committees should normally sit from 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m.(Paragraph 12.)(i?) The proposal that Standing Committees should sit three days a weekshould be regarded as an expedient to relieve congestion rather than as a normal practice, and the arrangement of sittings (after the first, which bycustom is fixed by the Chairman) should continue as heretofore to be theright of each Standing Committee.   (Paragraph 14.)(/) The Government should be empowered (under the conditions prescribed by the former S.O. No. 49A) to move the adjournment of the House after questions to enable Standing Committees to sit, but the right of private members to the half-hour adjournment should be preserved. (Paragraph 15.)(g) Where the Government wish to prescribe a time limit in respect of theproceedings in a Standing Committee, the guillotine motion should take theform of naming the date by which the Bill should be reported; the detailedallocation of sittings to parts of the Bill should be made by a Sub-Committeeof the Standing Committee consisting of the Chairman and seven other I Members nominated by Mr. Speaker.   (Paragraph 17.)(h) If an allocation of time is considered necessary for the Committeej stage of the few Bills which under the scheme may be referred to a Com-! j mittee of the whole House and for the Report stage of any Bills, the detailsI should be embodied in the guillotine motion as heretofore.   (Paragraph 18.)r I (i) No alteration should be made in the practice in Committee in regard; to debate upon the question, &quot; That the Clause stand part of the Bill &quot;.(Paragraph 19.); I    ij) Fuller use should be made of the practice whereby the Minister inI charge of a Bill circulates to the Committee notes on any clauses which are not readily understood without explanation.   (Paragraph 20.)I    (k) Debate should as heretofore be permissible on the Report of FinancialResolutions.

ioappendix to the first report from theAPPENDIX.MEMORANDUM BY HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT. ?In moving the Motion to set up the Select Committee on Procedure the lord president of the Council said that His Majesty&apos;s Government felt it might be useful for the Committee to be supplied with the Governments provisional ideas of possible changes in procedure (Hansard, Volume 413, No. 11, column 985). TheHouse, therefore, has instructed the Committee to report as soon as possible upon any scheme for the acceleration of proceedings on Public Bills which may he submitted to them on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government.2. In forwarding to the Committee the scheme which is attached to this Memo-randum the Government desires to restate the position regarding it. The schemewas originally drafted by a Committee of Ministers of the Coalition Government,but it did not, at any time, receive the approval of the War Cabinet and themembers of the War Cabinet are not in any way committed to it. The present government, whilst not thinking it right to commit itself at this stage, feels thatthe scheme covers a number of proposals which are eminently worthy of con-sideration by the Select Committee, and form a useful basis from which theCommittee may commence its discussions.3. His Majesty&apos;s Government, therefore,  puts forward this scheme for theCommittee to consider and to report to the House of Commons.2,rd September, 1945.SCHEME FOR ACCELERATION OF PROCEEDINGS ON PUBLIC BILLS.The need, for a modification of Parliamentary procedure.1. During the period of the &apos; transition from war to peace a really heavyprogramme of legislation of one kind and another will be required, and will berequired urgently, for the purposes of reconstruction. This will be the casewhatever the political complexion of the Government in power at the relevanttime; the contents of the programme would no doubt vary according to that factor,but on any view the volume will be such that any attempt to put it through under normal conditions of Parliamentary procedure in the course of one or two sessionswould be likely to result in a breakdown which might be disastrous to the interestsof the country. His Majesty&apos;s Government have accordingly thought it right tosubmit, for the earnest and urgent consideration of Parliament, certain suggestions for the modification of Parliamentary procedure as proposals which might be given a trial, on an experimental basis, during the first one or two sessions afterthe end of hostilities in Europe.Reasons for emphasis on House of Commons procedure.2. The problem is most acute in relation to the House of Commons. More-over, any saving of time effected in passing legislation through that House is likelyto improve the situation in the House of Lords in so far as it enables Billsintroduced in the lower House to be sent up earlier in the session. The Govern-ment have accordingly directed their main attention to the procedure in theHouse of Commons. aMatters not dealt with: subordinate legislation and private and provisional orderBills.3. This memorandum does not deal with the question of subordinate legislation.The proposals of the Government on that subject have already been made knownto the House in connection with the establishment of the Committee onStatutory Rules and Orders, &amp;c, which was set up on the 21st June last. nor does it deal with questions of private or provisional order Bills. These questions are under consideration by the Government in a different context (as indicated by the answer given by the Prime Minister to a question by Sir Arnold Gridley onthe 20th June last), but private and provisional order Bills do not make substantialdemands on the time of Parliament. Again, the memorandum does not deal(except incidentally) with the dates of sessions or hours of sitting of the House ofCommons. These are matters which necessarily have to be determined in thelight of the circumstances prevailing from time to time, but it is evident that itwill be necessary to ask Parliament to sit on as many days and for as many hoursas is reasonably practicable during the relevant period.
Outline of proposals for the Committee stage: reference of substantially all bills to Standing Committees and acceleration of passage of Bills in standing committees.4. The main expenditure of time upon legislation arises at the Committee stage.A major Bill may occupy ten or even twenty days in Committee if taken onthe floor of the House, or three or four months if taken upstairs. The recent example of the Education Bill, which occupied fourteen days on the floor of theHouse in Committee alone, provides an indication of the difficulties which wouldconfront any Government seeking to pass three or four Bills of that order in thecourse of a session to say nothing of smaller Bills, of which substantial numbers are required in a normal session, and exceptional numbers are likely to be needed in the abnormal conditions following the end of the war in Europe. If the attemptwere made at a time when the opposition was organised upon strict party lines,the difficulties would be further magnified. The first main proposals of theGovernment are accordingly directed to the Committee stage. In their opinion,it will be necessary during the reconstruction period both to send practically allBills upstairs and to find means of accelerating their passage in Standing Com-mittee.   These proposals are set out more fully in paragraphs 5 to 11 below.Reference of Bills to Standing Committees.5. In order to secure the committal of Bills to Standing Committees, no changein the Orders of the House is required beyond a return to Standing Order No. 46,under which all Bills (except Bills for imposing taxes, consolidated fund or appro-priation Bills, and provisional order confirmation Bills) stand committed to a standing Committee unless the House otherwise orders. Standing Order No. 46has been in force since 1907, but it has been the practice to retain &quot; the greatmeasures of the Session &quot; on the floor of the House, as well as short Bills whichare unlikely to require a detailed Committee Stage, and Bills introduced in circumstances of such urgency that it is necessary to ask the House to passthem within a few days, or even in one day (for example, the Merchant Shipping(Carriage of Munitions to Spain) Bill of 1936). The practice of retaining Billson the ground of importance has naturally varied from time to time accordingto the exigencies of the situation, and a Bill which would be regarded as one ofthe great measures of one Session would not necessarily be so regarded in thenext. In the reconstruction period, the Government propose that the practiceshould be abandoned in virtually all cases other than -(a) Bills already excepted under Standing Order No. 46; $(&amp;) Any Bill which it may be necessary to pass with great expedition; and(c) &quot; One-Clause &quot; Bills not requiring detailed &apos;examination in Committee.An exception would have to be made if any Bill of first-class constitutionalimportance were introduced, of the order, for instance, of the Bill for the Parlia-ment Act, 1911, or the Statute of Westminster, 1931; and the Government wouldnot divest themselves of the right to move that any important Bill -should beretained on the floor of the House if in the circumstances of the individual case&apos;they thought that course preferable. Equally the right of any Member to movethat any Bill should be retained on the floor of the House would, of course, remainunimpaired. But, with the exceptions indicated, the Government would for their part make a practice of refraining from moving in that sense, and of opposingsuch a motion if moved from another quarter.Outline of proposals for acceleration of Bills in Standing Committees: extension of sitting hours,   time table, increase of number of committees, and minor amendments of practice and procedure.6. The reference of substantially all Government Bills to Standing Committeesmay be estimated to save anything up to thirty days on the floor of the Houseof Commons in the course of a session-subject to any allowance which may haveto be made for additional time on Report of the Bills.** This estimate is based upon figures for the Sessions 1934-35 and 1936-37. in whichout of 80\ and 611 days respectively devoted to legislation on the floor of the House(excluding the Finance Bill and Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills), 38J and i8 days respectively were occupied by Committee stages.
This saving would, however, be of. little value if it were achieved only at thecost of a bottleneck upstairs. Accordingly, the Government propose that in orderto accelerate the passage of the Bills in Standing Committee (a) The number of hours devoted to the sittings of Standing committees should be substantially increased over the pre-war minimum standard of four hours per week;(6) Machinery should be prepared for prescribing and enforcing a time limit on the proceedings in Standing Committee;(c) The number of Standing Committees should be increased, the size of theCommittees being reduced, if necessary, for the purpose; and(d) Certain minor amendments should be made in the procedure and practice in the debates in Committee.Hours of sittings of Standing Committees.7. Before the war it was the normal practice of Standing Committees to sitonly for four hours per week, between ri a.m. and 1 p.m. on Tuesdays andThursdays. Afternoon sessions were only occasionally held, usually towards theend of the proceedings on a Bill when time was becoming short. The Govern-ment propose that these hours should be -substantially increased. The possible methods of doing so are to add an additional sitting day or to provide for longersitting hours on sitting days, and it is suggested that both these methods should beadopted. For example, the Committees might sit on Wednesdays as well asTuesday and Thursday, and the normal hours of morning sittings might be10-45 a.m. until 1-15 p.m. These proposals alone, if accepted, would nearly double the normal sitting time of Standing Committees. In addition, the Govern-ment suggest that, if a situation arises where there is a danger of a blockageupstairs while time is relatively easy on the floor of the House, the House should adjourn immediately after Questions on a certain number of days in order toenable the Standing- Committees to continue in the afternoon. (If substantiallyall Bills are sent upstairs as proposed above, it is much more probable than ithas been hitherto that there will be times when the House itself is comparativelyfree from work.) For this purpose, therefore, the Government propose that thereshould be a return to the old Standing Order No. 49A, which was passed in 1919but was never used and was repealed as obsolete in 1933.* The proposals outlinedhere as to the hours of sittings of Standing Committees are, of course, based onthe assumption that in the relevant period the House will have reverted to its pre-war hours of sitting at least to the extent that it will no longer meet duringthe morning. If this is not so the only alternative appears to be to make a muchmore extensive use of the practice of adjourning the House in order to enable theCommittees to sit.Time table on proceedings in Standing Committee: alternative methods.&apos; S. The Government also consider that steps should be taken to secure thatBills committed to Standing Committees are reported to the House at theappropriate time. Without resorting to a guillotine resolution proper, somethingmight be achieved for this purpose if the House were to pass a resolutionrequiring the Committee to which the Bill is referred to report the Bill by a givendate, with or without an instruction enabling them to allocate the availabletime as between the various clauses or groups of clauses of the Bill. Such aresolution, would, however, lack effective sanction, and if the proceedings in committee were not completed by the time specified in the Resolution, theCommittee Stage would have to be finished off on the floor of the House. TheGovernment therefore propose that in any case where it is essential to obtainthe report of a Bill within a given time, the proceedings in Committee should be governed by a special type of guillotine resolution.* The Standing Order provided that a motion might be made by a Minister at thecommencement of public business to adjourn the House in order to facilitate the businessof standing committees, and that such a motion should be decided without amendmentor debate.
Guillotine resolutions in relation to proceedings in Standing Committee.g. This resolution would be passed by the House.   It would settle the totaltime to be made available for the Committee Stage of the Bill, and would alsocontain provisions, on the lines of a normal guillotine resolution, providing forthe conclusion of the proceedings on the whole of the Bill, and on particularclauses or groups of clauses of the Bill, by means of putting without debate all questions necessary to dispose of the business.   The resolution would not, how-ever, itself specify the intermediate times at which proceedings on particularclauses or groups of clauses were to be brought to a conclusion, but would leavethat to be determined by a Special Committee of the House in accordance withthe proposal set out below (see paragraph 12).   The main problem arising in^connection with the application of a guillotine resolution to proceedings in^Standing Committee is the unit to be taken for the purpose of measuring time.]The system of &apos;&apos; allotted days &apos;&apos; which is used in the case of a resolution relating;to proceedings on the floor of the House is, as such, inappropriate to proceedingsJin Standing Committees, and it is for consideration whether it would be bestIto arrange the time on the basis of sittings, of sitting days or of weeks, or byireference to actual dates.   The question depends to some extent upon how muchjuse is made of the practice of adjourning the House as proposed above, and uponIthe hours and days of the week adopted for the sittings of the Committees.   Theproblem is not, however, an insoluble one; the greatest accuracy would be attained by taking a sitting as the unit (treating afternoon sittings as separateSittings for the purpose), but in practice it might prove more convenient to adoptlone of the other alternatives indicated above.   It goes without saying that the&quot;application of a time limit to proceedings in Standing Committee should not beregarded as absolving the Chairman from the duty to use his powers of selection and closure so as to direct the debate to the main points at issue; on the con-trary, the time limit would make it all the more necessary that these powers should be SO&apos; used.Number of Standing Committees.\ 10. Under Standing Order No. 47 the maximum number of Standing Com-mittees, including the Standing Committee on Scottish Bills, is five. The four; Standing Committees other than the Scottish Committee are composed of between thirty and fifty permanent members, and between ten and thirty-five members added by the Committee of Selection for the particular Bill underconsideration, and the quorum is twenty. Accordingly the maximum numberof members who could be put on a Standing Committee for any Bill was eighty-five, though in practice the usual numbers appointed before the war were sixtyor seventy according to the importance of the Bill. The Government proposethat there should be an increase in the number of Standing Committees, and consider that no difficulties of accommodation should be allowed to stand in the-way d? this increase. In their view an increase will be necessary to secure thepassage of the volume of legislation which is likely to be required during thereconstruction period, and is also desirable in order to provide further oppor-tunities for members of the House to perform useful service as such. For thelatter reason, it is not in their opinion a necessary corollary of an increase in thenumber of Committees that there should be a reduction in the size of thoseCommittees. If, however, difficulties were encountered in securing the necessaryible 4umbers, they would propose that any reduction in size should be effected in the k a nucleus of the Committees, leaving the numbers who may be added for a, in particular Bill as it stands under existing orders.the Minor amendments of practice and procedure: restriction of debate on the clause the        and increased use of explanatory material.&apos;tain, &apos; n. Two other suggestions may be made as to the proceedings on thed be Committee Stage: (1) The debates on the question, which has to be put on each clause, &quot; thattVhe   r^e c^ause stand part of the Bill,&quot; might be restricted by means of a new. e55   -istanding Order to the effect that where a clause has been amended debatement   should not be permitted on the clause unless the Chairman is of opinion thatj \jthe principle of the clause, or any substantial point arising thereon, has nothattheLingionven
appendix to the first report from thebeen adequately discussed. The object of this would be to assist the Chairmanin preventing abuse of the debate by means of the delivery of second readingspeeches or the repetition of arguments already advanced in the debates on amendments. Any such Standing Order should be framed as to leave itopen to members to ask questions as to the effect of the clause, so long as theydid not make a speech in doing so.(2) A fuller use might well be made of a practice occasionally adopted inthe past, by.which the Minister in charge of a Bill circulates to the committeenotes on any clauses which are not readily understood without explanation.This expedient would reduce the number of cases in which amendments are put down for the purpose of obtaining an explanation of the clause, and would prevent the waste of time which occasionally occurs - when amendments are based on a misapprehension of the effect of the clause.Improvement of time-table procedure: establishment of &quot; Emergency business committee.&quot;12. The second main proposal which the Government wish to put forwardis for an improvement in the procedure relating to time-tables. For this purpose they suggest that a Special Committee of the House should be appointed at thebeginning of the Session, consisting of the members of the Chairmen&apos;s Paneltogether with perhaps five additional members nominated by Mr. Speaker. Ina case where a Bill was subject to a guillotine resolution, the function of theCommittee would be to allocate, as between the various parts of the Bill, the timeallowed by the resolution for any particular stage of the Bill. In the view ofthe Government, it might be more satisfactory to the House in general if the detailed allocation of the time were worked out by a Committee of this characterinstead of being laid down, as hitherto, by the terms of the resolution itself. Theydo not, however, consider that it would be practicable to leave it to such aCommittee to settle the total amount of time to be made available for a Bill. Sofar as the Committee stage is concerned, the function of the Special Committeeof the House would, if the previous proposals are accepted, be limited almost exclusively to proceedings in Standing Committee (see paragraph 9 above); butit would also be required to act in relation to proceedings on the floor of theHouse in any case where a guillotine was applied to the other stages of the Bill.If any such Committee is appointed it is suggested that it might be known as&quot; the Emergency Business Committee,&apos;&apos; or by some other title indicating the exceptional nature of the business with which it is to be concerned. Such aCommittee might also be of considerable assistance in the arrangement of a voluntary time-table in appropriate cases.Minor changes in financial procedure on Bills.13. Apart from the proposals outlined above, the Government have a fewfurther suggestions to make for the reform of the procedure at the various stages of Bills. These are of comparatively small importance and are all related to financial matters:  (1) It is suggested that the time has come to give effect to a recommendationput forward some time ago, that on the report stage of a Financial resolution the question should be put without amendment or debate. This should applynot only to the normal financial resolution moved after second reading of theBill, but also to Ways and Means resolutions other than those upon which theFinance Bill is founded, and the object would be to prevent the repetition oranticipation on the report of the resolution of the second reading debate onthe Bill. In practice debate seldom arises now on the reporc of a financial resolution, but the opportunity remains and could be used for purposes ofobstruction. (With this change there would still be some duplication of debate on the Committee stage of the resolution and the second reading of the Bill,but it does not appear practicable to dispense with this.)(2) A change might now be made in the rule which prevents two stages oi a financial Resolution from being taken on the same day. Under the present practice no two stages of any financial business may be taken on the same day(except in the case mentioned in Standing Order No. 70) without a special procedure Resolution, and accordingly the report of a Financial Resolution
cannot toe taken immediately after committee, even where it is not desiredto debate it. There appears to be little point in the rule so far as it applies to Financial Resolutions, particularly if effect is given to the proposal in thisparagraph as to the report stage of such Resolutions.(3) The technical rule under which a Financial Resolution is required tocover provisions of a Bill requiring money to be paid &quot;into the Exchequer &quot;might now be abolished. The rule does not apply where the; payments aredirected to be made to a particular Minister, though the effect &quot;of such aprovision is exactly the same.(4) Under the present practice of the House, any new clause or amendmentis out of order on report if it creates or imposes a charge on the public revenueor imposes or extends any tax, rate or other local burden, or varies the in-cidence of any such charge or burden. It is suggested that in order to saveexpenditure of time on the recommittal of Bills this rule might now be abolishedso far as it relates to rates or other local burdens.Methods of czirtailing time spent on other btisiness.14. The proposals outlined in the previous paragraphs are directed to the saving of time occupied by the passage of Bills.     The Government have also considered how far it may be practicable  to  obtain  more time  for general legislation required for reconstruction purposes by curtailing the time taken upby other business.    On this subject their provisional conclusions are mainlynegative.   As regards private members&apos; time, they consider that the situation islikely to remain as at present during the relevant period.  They do not, however,contemplate any inroad upon Question time.   The proceedings on the budget and the Finance Bill offer certain opportunities for the repetition of debates,and have been subject to criticism on that account.   On balance, however, theGovernment are of opinion that it would not be right to propose any change inthese proceedings, since the Finance Bill is pre-eminently a case in which theopportunity for second thoughts justifies expenditure of the additional time.The Government have also considered possible economies of time in relationto the business of supply, including Consolidated Fund and Appropriation Bills,i but are not able to make any general recommendation on that subject.    Ini particular they do not advocate a repetition of the experiments of sending the] estimates upstairs, or of a formal reduction in the number of days allotted to] supply and to moving Mr. Speaker out of the Chair on supply.   These occasions,j together with the proceedings on the Consolidated Fund Bills, provide oppor-&apos; tunities for general debates, and if those opportunities were curtailed it would be a practical necessity to find equivalent time elsewhere.   For the same reasons they have decided not to recommend the allocation of a fixed number of days tothe spring supplementary estimates.    On the other hand, the House has on occasion been willing to accept an agreed reduction in the number of supplyidays where special circumstances have rendered this necessary, and has also on; occasion passed the spring supplementaries under an agreed time-table.   In thereconstruction period it may well be that the House would allow the government similar latitude if it appeared likely that a heavy programme of reconstructioni Bills would otherwise become blocked for lack of time.   Apart from this, some additional time would be made available if routine financial Bills (such as PublicWorks Loans Bills and Post Office Telegraph l(Money) Bills) were sent upstairsJin accordance with the previous recommendation.Carry over of public Bills.15. The Government have also examined again the much discussed questionof carrying over public Bills at the end of a session. In general they are opposedto the creation of any breach in the present rule, which lies at the root both of effective government and of effective opposition. If in the relevant period a situation arises where one or more important Bills are hkely to be lost throughpack of time at the end of the session, the first line of defence should be, in theirriew, to prolong the session so far as this is practicable. If this were not sufficient, the question of carry over could still be considered on its merits in thelight of all relevant circumstances, and the Government do not rule out thepossibility that in some cases the immediate practical necessities might outweigh the general objections on the other&quot; side&apos;.&apos;&quot;&quot;

It was foreseen that, whatever party should bein power at that time, a heavy programme of legislation would be urgently required for the purposes of reconstruction, andl that it would not be possibleto put through such a programme under the normal conditions of Parliamentary
procedure in the course of one or two sessions.

Your Committee desire to draw attention to the experi-mental character of the proposals submitted by the Government and to emphasise that it is purely on this basis that they have considered them.

on each, the Government proposals express the opinion that it would not neces-sarily do so, but that, if difficulties arose in securing the necessary numbers, thereduction should be in the permanent nucleus rather than in the numbers addedin respect of a particular Bill (under the existing Standing Order No. 48, notless than 10 nor more than 35). Your Committee concur with this view and recommend the reduction of the permanent nucleus to 20 with the additionof 30 Members in respect of a Bill, making a total of 50.

Your Committee are not entirely convinced ofthe value of this suggestion. The fact that this Order was never put intooperation during the period when it was in force, 1919 to 1933, suggests that itsusefulness is somewhat problematical. The fundamental difficulty is that its use would reduce the time in which the House usually sits. On the one hand, in aSession which ex hypothesi has a great burden of legislation, there will be great45870 A 4
pressure on the time of the House for the other stages of Bills: Second Readings,Report stages, and Third Readings. On the. other hand, even if at any period&apos;of the session time on the floor of the House should he relatively easy, theGovernment would probably be unwilling, by adjourning the House under Stand-ing Order No. 49A, to admit that business, was; not congested, and private members would be encouraged to press far time for the discussion of topics whichthey held to be urgent. It is, however, possible that a situation such as theGovernment scheme contemplates might arise, when the floor of the house was comparatively free-and that in the circumstances the House might be willingto agree to such a-motion as Standing Order 49A provided! for. Your committee see no objection to the revival of some such power. They are, however, con-cerned that there should be no further inroad into the already severely curtailedtime, available for Private Members to raise matters, and they recommend thatthe revival of Standing Order 49A should take some such form as that suggestedby the Clerk of the House (see Memorandum by the Clerk of the House, paragraph13 and Appendix C 2). This variant, by limiting the time of adjournment to7.15 p.m. (6.r5 p.m. if an adjournment under Standing Order No. 8 had beengranted), would preserve the right of Private Members to the half hour adjourn-ment, and would also give the Government two hours in which to do&apos; theirown business. Alternatively, if it were considered inconvenient and impracticable to recall the House for so short a spell of work, Your Committee would recommendthat the half hour adjournment should be taken immediately after questions and any Ministerial or personal statement, and that the Standing committees should meet from 4.30 p.tn. to 7 p.m.,&quot; read. , .Amendment proposed in line 3 to leave out from &quot; afternoon &quot; to &quot; They &quot;in line 19 and insert,&quot; It is a disadvantage of this proposal that it would reduce the time in whichthe House usually sits and therefore deprive the Government of some of thetime which the scheme is intended to save. This disadvantage would, however,be outweighed in the situation contemplated in the Governmenfs proposal, i.e.,&apos; if a situation arises where there is a danger of a blockage upstairs while time is relatively easy on the floor of the House &apos;. Your. Committee accordingly recommend the revival of the powers given by S.O. No. 49A.&quot; (Mr. MauriceWebb:) , , ;/    f v.^,^^ -Question proposed, &quot; That the words proposed to be left out stand part of the paragraph.&quot;The Committee divided: Ayes, 7; Noes, 8. ..Ayes.Mr. W.

While they recognise that circumstances may arise in which it willbe necessary to prescribe a time li-mit upon the proceedings in a StandingCommittee, they do not consider that the method proposed is the best calculated to achieve the result. They were much impressed by the criticisms of the clerk of the House. These may be stated briefly. First, the main value of the proposals is for- the Committee Stage- of Bills, that being the only stage capable of elaboratesubdivision.   Secondly, it would provide for a second opportunity of debate,
sriz., upon the report of the Emergency Business Committee unless provisionffere made for the agreement of the House to that Committee&apos;s report withoutmendment or debate.    This might result in saving the time  of the HouseIt the expense of good relations in the Standing Committee and might lea.pl after^he first experience to systematic obstruction of guillotine motions in respect of subsequent Bills.   Finally, it would not be a good thing that the Chairmen, whoSvould constitute so large a part of the proposed Committee, should be identified(with decisions which could hardly be challenged on any other ground than thatThey were unfair to some section of the critics of a Bill.   For these reasonslYour Committee prefer a method on the lines of the counter-suggestion madeShy the Clerk of the House, and generally assented to by other witnesses, viz.,that in any case where the Government felt it necessary to prescribe a time-limit in respect of the proceedings in a Standing Committee, the guillotine motionIhould take the form of naming a date by which the Bill should be reported.The detailed allocation of sittings of the Standing Committee to- parts of the Billjvould be the work of a Sub-Committee of the Standing Committee, to consistfof the Chairman and seven other Members to be nominated by Mr. Speaker.&apos;The advantages of such a proposal are twofold.    First, the work of detailedAllocation would be in the hands of persons who as members of the Standing([Committee concerned would in any case have to make a study of the Bill.Secondly, the necessity of a second reference to the House, with or without thelopportunity of debate, would be avoided and the approval of the scheme would&apos; be left to the body which, as having to work under it, would be primarily con-jcerned, namely the Standing Committee,&quot; read.Amendments made.Another Amendment proposed in line 22 after &quot; reported &quot; to insert,&quot; Your Committee recommend that this motion should also provide that thefctanddng Committee must have sat for a specified number of meetings of atleast two hours each before the guihotine comes into operation.   Otherwise ifthere were no quorum on one or more of  the ordinary days of meeting thelime available for discussion of the Bill would fall short of that contemplatedIvhen the guillotine motion was proposed and might be quite inadequate.    ItIhould be in the power of the Committee to fix additional meetings if necessaryIon Wednesday mornings or at such other time as they should determine.&quot; pr.
