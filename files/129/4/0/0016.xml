Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET. ,CP. (45) 266.%rd November, 1945. cabinet.GREECE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.A delegation from the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Labour Partyvisited me on the 31st October to urge oh me more active intervention in Greekinternal affairs.2.   Hitherto, my policy has been that the Greeks must form their own -Government withoufrmy intervention, though I have always been ready to advocateall possible assistance to Greece in her reconstruction.3. The Regent has now formed a new Government, headed by M. Kanello-poulos. This was done on the Regent&apos;s own initiative, without consultation with me. Sir R; Leeper was informed in advance, but made no comment. The newPrime Minister is a young man (42), with a reputation for honesty and sincerity,but not for great practical ability. His views are Liberal, but he has no definiteconnexion with any of the major Parties in Greece. He was banished to one ofthe islands under the Metaxas dictatorship, returned to join the Army as a privatewhen the Italians invaded Greece, escaped abroad under the German occupation and returned to Greece after the liberation. The other members of his cabinet are mainly unknown figures.4. The regent&apos;s  choice is thus by no means perfect, but it is something thata Government has at last been established, and I think we ought now to try to helpit in every possible way to consolidate the difficult position in Greece until theelections can be held. I therefore propose to send the Parliamentary Under-Secretary to Athens at once. I suggest that he should put to the new GreekGovernment the following programme. They will be told that, if they desire it,we are prepared to provide advisers to help them on the following subjects  Army.Finance.Railways.Roads.Distribution and Supplies.5. These advisers would be attached to the appropriate Greek Ministries.They would not have executive powers, but would have to work through Greekagencies and, together, would co-ordinate their efforts and policy. Their object would be to get Greek economy working again. We should hope to withdrawthem as soon as possible. But as long as they were there, we should hope thattheir advice would       general rule be taken.6. In addition, we should offer to assist the Greeks in regard to their import programme. In this respect, we should concentrate on imports likely to get Greekeconomy working, rather than on consumption goods, e.g., we should importagricultural machinery rather than food, and raw materials rather than finishedarticles.7.   We should also do what we can to strengthen TJ.N.R.RA.8. We should also advise the Greek Government to issue a lottery loan. Ifsuch a loan were a success it would not only mop up surplus purchasing powerbut would provide the Greek Government with the drachmae which it requires.13005   [30811]Copy No.     g 0
At the moment it is financing over 50 per cent, of its expenditure in the most directly inflationary manner, i.e., by the printing of notes, the circulation ofwhich has increased from 49&apos;^ milliard drachmae to 62 milliard in October. Ifthe loan were a failure the damage.would not be serious as there is so little&apos;confidence left to destroy. With the present inflationary situation it would beimpossible to float an ordinary interest-bearing stock since no rate of interest is likely to attract subscribers who would have no confidence in the future valueof their capital. But the Near Eastern mentality discounts these risks whenoffered a chance of drawing a large prize, and, even during an inflationaryperiod, lottery loans were over-subscribed in Cyprus, Iraq and Palestine.9. In return, we should expect the Greeks to undertake the following programme: (a) they should purge the Army;(b) they should give every facility to the Legal Commission which is to go-out to investigate prisons (this they have already undertaken to do);(c) they should issue a lottery loan (see paragraph 8);(d) they should pass empowering legislation enabling them where necessaryto take over industries, to use compulsion to get roads in order andto institute a system to Government retail;(e) they should work out a long-term policy of railway development:(/) they should consider with the Electoral Commissions of the three Powers(Great Britain, United States and France) whether the electoralregisters require revision;(g) they should fix a date for the elections and abide by it.E. B.Foreign Office, 3rd November, 1945.
