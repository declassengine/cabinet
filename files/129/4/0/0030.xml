Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.Copy No.     JCABINET.CEYLON CONSTITUTION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.1. My colleagues will recollect that the Statement of Policy on Constitu-tional reform, issued as a White Paper (Cmd. 6690) on the 31st October, concluded with the announcement of His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention of taking intoaccount the views expressed by the State Council of Ceylon on the proposals putforward by His Majesty&apos;s Government, and the number of Members of that Councilvoting in favour of adopting the new Constitution.2. On the 8th November Mr. D. S. Senanayake, Leader of the Council and vice-Chairman of the Board of Ministers, moved a motion in the State Councilin the following terms : &quot; This House expresses its disappointment that His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment have deferred the admission of Ceylon to full Dominion status, but inview of the assurance contained in the White Paper of the 31st October, 1945,that His Majesty&apos;s Government will co-operate with the people of Ceylonso that such status may be attained by this country in a comparatively short time, this House resolves that the Constitution offered in the said white paper be accepted during the interim period.&quot;3. I am glad to be able to report to my colleagues that this motion wascarried by fifty-one votes to three. The total voting strength of the councils at present fifty-seven. One Sinhalese and 2 Indian Tamils voted againstthe motion, while 38 Sinhalese, 5 Tamils, 3 Moslems, 4 Europeans and 1 Burgher,51 in all, voted in favour of it. The motion was thus carried by a majoritysubstantially in excess of the proportion of three-quarters originally con-templated in His Majesty&apos;s Government^ Declaration of the 26th May, 1943,as one of the conditions of the approval of any new Constitutional schemeformulated by Ministers.4. I therefore propose, if my colleagues agree, to inform the Board ofMinisters through the Governor that His Majesty&apos;s Government have learnedwith satisfaction of the acceptance of Mr. Senanayake&apos;s motion by a very substantial majority of the voting strength of the State Council, and have approved of the necessary steps being taken to give effect to His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment&apos;s undertaking to grant to Ceylon a new Constitution on the basis set outin the White Paper.G.

(45) 281.14th Novembers 1945.cabinet.THE INDIAN SITUATION.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India.I circulate (Annexure 1) for the urgent consideration of my colleagues, amemorandum which I have just received from the Viceroy analysing in graveterms the situation with which he is confronted in the light of the increasingviolence of the speeches of certain of the foremost Congress leaders. I also circu-late (Annexure II), to be read with it, a letter from the Viceroy forwarding anote of his recent interview with Jawaharlal Nehru referred to in paragraph 5of the memorandum. In Annexure III I reproduce extracts of the speechesdelivered in recent weeks by Congress leaders.The Viceroy is convinced that the Congress leaders, as represented by Nehru,Vallabhbhai Patel, Asaf Ali, and Pant, contemplate resort sooner or later to force in order to secure their goal of complete independence. He thinks it improb-able that Congress will attempt a rising, until the elections are completed next april, unless events force their hand, but he warns His Majesty&apos;s Government tobe prepared for a serious attempt by Congress next spring, and even possiblysooner, to subvert the present administration by force.Nehru&apos;s utterances since the Viceroy wrote his memorandum have madespecific reference to &quot; revolt&quot; and adopted a threatening tone in regard to&quot;settlement of differences between Congress and the Moslem League and betweenCongress and Great Britain. I do not take all Nehru&apos;s speeches at their face value, and recognise that much may be set down to the ebullience of electioneeringand to the fact that it is only a few months since he was released from detention.But I cannot take the Viceroy&apos;s warning lightly, particularly as I am told forthe first time that there are signs of a demoralising effect not only among thecivil services but also in the Indian Army.The following points arise for consideration from the Viceroy&apos;smemorandum : (a) The Viceroy assumes (para. 9) that there will be no question of theacceptance of a Congress ultimatum. I ask that I may be authorised by my colleagues to give him the assurance that his assumption is justified and that there will be no question of giving carte blanche to congress.(&amp;) The Viceroy considers (para. 11) that there would be justification for moving against Congress now, but (para. 12) does not recommendimmediate action unless it is necessitated by disorders. I share his view and ask for agreement to it by my colleagues.(c) The Viceroy, however, considers that at a very early date a declaration should be made of the attitude of His Majesty&apos;s Government towardsthe growing threat of violence, covering the four heads suggested inhis paragraph 13. In my view the need for an immediate statement is not established, but I consider that a statement should be prepared[30880] b
