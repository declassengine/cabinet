Printed for the Cabinet.   November 1945.SECRET. . Copy No.CP. (45) 276.8th &quot;November, 1945.. CABINET.EFFECTS OF THE DOCK STRIKE.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.BEFORE the recent dock strike ended with the return to work of dockerson Monday, the 5th November, I had prepared a Memorandum on the effects of the strike on the shipping position and on import and export programmes.I think that my colleagues may still like to see the Memorandum, as it shows the serious effects of the stoppage in the docks. The Memorandum represents the position at the 30th October.A. B.Ministry of War Trans-port, W. 1,8th November, 1945.ANNEX.Effects of the Dock Strike.AS a result of the dock strike which began on the 25th September, about220 ships on which no work was being done were held up in British ports onthe 30th October. Of these 170 contained imports awaiting discharge, and 50 werewaiting to load outwards. The incoming ships contained 75 cargoes of timber,20 full cargoes of food, 25 cargoes of iron ore and other raw materials, and50 general cargoes of mixed food and materials. These ships represent delays toour import programme which cannot be replaced because their carrying powerlost during their enforced idleness has irretrievably gone, and because there isa danger that a number of ports, for example in the Baltic, to which they would normally have gone for further cargoes will now be ice-bound before all the cargoescan be cleared from them.2. The loss of carrying capacity is severe. 110 British ships, which shouldhave been loaded with further cargoes during November, will not now be availablein that month. To make good a part of the loss it will be necessary to spendsome of our remaining dollars on additional freight for trans-Atlantic tonnage,thus reducing our slender dollar resources which should be reserved for purchasingmuch-needed supplies of food and raw materials. At the same time, to getships away quickly to load homewards again, export cargo which should beearning foreign exchange with which to buy our imports has had to be left behind to the disappointment both of the customers abroad, who are anxiouslyawaiting delivery, and of manufacturers and workers at home who are swinginginto the export drive.3. It is now estimated that, mainly owing to the dock strike, UnitedKingdom imports for the year will be \ million tons less than was expected beforethe strike began, and there will be a further bill to pay in the loss of future importsfor the reasons given above.[30856]
4. The effects of the strike will continue to upset our food supplies andthe output of manufactured goods, and will interfere with the housing programme for months to come. Similarly, if the supply of raw material is seriously interrupted, the revival of the export trade will be correspondinglyretarded, with consequent loss of employment and. delay of the whole process ofof rehabilitation. The housing programme in particular, will suffer since thestrike/hati prevented the seasonal building up of stocks of timber for the winferto cover the period until imports on a full scale can be resumed next May, whenthe Baltic and the St. Lawrence are open again. !. ..
