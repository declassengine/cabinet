CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   &amp;C. (53) 108th January, 1953CABINETTHE ROYAL STYLE AND TITLESMemorandum by the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth relations on 18th March, 1952, the Cabinet authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to consult with Commonwealth Governments with a view to securing agreement to achange in the form of the Royal Style and Titles on the lines recommended in areport (C. (52) 55) by a Cabinet Committee under the Lord Chancellor^ Chairman-ship (C.C. (52) 31st Conclusions, Minute 5). The general principle underlying thechange then recommended was that each Commonwealth country should use for itsown purposes a Title in which it was itself mentioned by name while other partsof the Commonwealth were described in a generic phrase. The ensuing corres-pondence between Commonwealth Governments indicated that, while there was a wide measure of agreement with this principle, there was an undesirable degree ofvariation between the Titles preferred by the different Governments for their ownuse. At this point it was decided that, rather than attempt to carry the matter further by correspondence, it would be preferable to take the opportunity for personal discussion between the Commonwealth Ministers who would be attending the Commonwealth Economic Conference.2. Two meetings were held on this subject with the Prime Ministers and otherHeads of Delegations to that Conference. As a result agreement was reached and placed on record in an Agreed Minute, which is reproduced in the Annex to thismemorandum. The substance of this agreement was published in the press on13th December.3. As will be seen, there is a substantial common element in the variableTitles which will be adopted for use in the various countries of the Commonwealth,subject to approval by the respective Parliaments and to Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure.The Title for use in the United Kingdom will be:  &quot; Elizabeth II, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of GreatBritain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and TerritoriesQueen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.&quot;The Titles for use in Canada, Australia and New Zealand will include, inaddition to the name of the country concerned, a reference to the United Kingdom;and in all these countries, as well as in the United Kingdom itself, the Title willcontinue to include the phrases &quot; by the Grace of God &quot; and &quot; Defender of theFaith.&quot;South Africa and Ceylon will use a shorter form of Title which omits thosephrases and contains no reference to the United Kingdom.Pakistan doubtless because of current discussions regarding its future constitutional status-finds difficulty in accepting a form of Title describing the sovereign as &quot; Queen of Pakistan,&quot; and prefers a formula which mentions theUnited Kingdom, but leaves Pakistan itself to be covered by the phrase &quot; otherRealms and Territories.&quot;43515Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953
4. The representatives of all the Commonwealth countries (save India, whichhas no responsibilities in this matter) have undertaken to take early action intheir several countries to secure the appropriate constitutional approval for these changes. In most of the countries legislation will be required. In some it maysuffice that the Parliament should indicate its approval by passing a resolution.In Ceylon the Government^ legal advisers may take the view that no parliamentary proceedings are required. It is understood that, in all the countries concerned,the necessary action for securing approval of the proposed changes can be com-pleted before the end of May. It should therefore be possible to bring the changesinto operation in all the countries concerned, before the Coronation, by the issueof simultaneous proclamations on a pre-arranged date.5. In the United Kingdom legislation will be required amending the Royaland Parliamentary Titles Act, 1927. The Home Secretary has given instructions for the preparation of the necessary Bill. This should be ready for introductionsoon after Parliament reassembles in January; and we should aim at passing it through all its stages in both Houses by the middle of May, at the latest.6. It remains to settle the Latin version of the new Title in the form for usein the United Kingdom. This is required for the new Great Seal and, in abbreviatedform, for the coinage.  We recommend that the full Latin version should be:  ELIZABETH SECUNDA DEI GRATIA BRITANNIARUM ETCETERORUM REGNORUM SUORUM ET TERR ARUM REGINA,CONSORTIONIS POPULORUM PRINCEPS, FIDEI DEFENSORThe whole of this Title could not be included, even in abbreviated form, onthe coinage. For this purpose some of its elements will have to be discarded. Wethink that the best formula for the coinage would be:  ELIZABETH II D.G. REG. FID. DEF.The Latin version of the Title has neither statutory sanction nor constitutionalsignificance. Nor need it be settled in agreement between all members of theCommonwealth. We recommend, however, that other Commonwealth Govern-ments should be informed of the full and the abbreviated versions which we proposeto use in this country, so that those which use a Latin inscription on their coinagemay have both in mind in considering what abbreviated formula would be suitablefor use on their coins.SIMONDS.D. M. F.SWINTON.8th January, 1953.annex the Royal Style and TitlesAgreed MinuteThe Prime Ministers and other Heads of Delegations to the commonwealth economic Conference, after considering the views expressed in correspondence between Governments on the need for a change in the form of the Royal Style andTitles, recorded their agreement on the following points:  (1) A uniform Title for use in all Commonwealth countries is impracticablein present circumstances.&apos; (2) If different forms of Title are to be used in different parts of the Common-wealth, the common element in all should be as large as possible.(3) The Title used in all countries should include the phrase &quot; Head of theCommonwealth &quot; and a reference to Her Majesty&apos;s other Realms and territories.(4) The inclusion of the phrases &quot;By the Grace of God&quot; and &quot; Defender ofthe Faith &quot; would be a matter for decision by each Government.
(5) The Titles used in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand,South Africa and Ceylon would include the name of the country concerned.(6) The Titles used in Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Pakistan would include a reference to the United Kingdom.(7) In countries other than the United Kingdom the shorter form &quot; the UnitedKingdom &quot; would be used in preference to the full term &quot; the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.&quot;2. Thus, subject to Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure, the Titles for these sevencountries of the Commonwealth would be as follows:  United Kingdom ...   Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and ofHer other Realms and Territories Queen, Head of theCommonwealth, Defender of the Faith.Canada     ...      ...   Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the UnitedKingdom, Canada and Her other Realms and TerritoriesQueen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.&apos;Australia   ......   Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the UnitedKingdom, Australia and Her other Realms and TerritoriesQueen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.New Zealand      ...   Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the UnitedKingdom, New Zealand and Her other Realms and Terri-tories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of theFaith.South Africa       ...   Elizabeth the Second, Queen of South Africa and of Herother Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth.Pakistan    ......   Elizabeth the Second, Queen of the United Kingdom andof Her other Realms and Territories, Head of theCommonwealth.Ceylon      ......   Elizabeth the Second, Queen of Ceylon and of Her otherRealms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth.3. The representatives of the Commonwealth countries concerned undertook to take, at the earliest convenient opportunity, such action as is necessary in each country to secure the appropriate constitutional approval for these changes. they further agreed that it would be of advantage if the changes were brought intooperation simultaneously in all the countries concerned by the issue of simultaneousProclamations.4. A public announcement of this intention should be made at the earliestpossible date in the terms of the [attached] draft communique to the Press.5. The representatives of the Commonwealth countries expressed the viewthat the procedure of prior consultation between all Commonwealth governments which had been adopted on this occasion should be followed in future if occasionarose to propose a change in the form of Title used in any Commonwealth country.
