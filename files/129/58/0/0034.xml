secret.(53) 3431st JANUARY, 1953.-  SUPPLY expenditure memorandum by the President of the Board of trade the memorandum of the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Supply-Expenditure (C. (53) 31) reveals a situation of grave concern to industry and toour export prospects.   An increase in defence expenditure of  ICQ millionsapproved by the Cabinet on 7th November (C.C.(52) 9-1-th Conclusions) has.beenmatched by an increase in civil expenditure on Social and other services of 105 millions.   These increases are reduced by sayings put into effector proposed of  109 millions leaving a net increaseof  146 millions over thepresent year&apos;s level of expenditure.   I think we must ask ourselves whetherthe economy can really stand increased expenditure upon this scale.2. Of the many problems which confront British industry only one iscrippling in its dimensions, namely, the present level of industrial taxation.This view is more than a departmental opinion.   It has in recent weeks been voiced by every Chairman of every bank in the City and is widely expressed.by those  in touch with our industrial life.   Indeed, theChancellor of the Exchequer in his opening paragraph says:-&quot;Unless industry is given the freedom and the resources tore-equip itself and to keep in the van of progress, we cannot hope to support the standard of life and the position in..the world whichwe now enjoy. &quot; .Industry cannot re-equip itself unless taxation is substantially reduced.3. The Anglo-American Productivity Council have pointed to the lackof adequate re-equipment in- British industry.   It is hard to see how this -equipment is to take place.   Net personal savings are today nil.   Companiespay between 50 per cent and 75 per cent of their chargeable profits in direct taxation.   Small companies in particular, which should be the spearhead of new development, lack both the cash to start and the incentive to adventure.4. The target which has been set for British industry is a 20 per cent increase in exports.   I do not believe that industry can make itself competitive,or be in any shape to achieve this target, against a background of expendituresuch as that which is here proposed.5. i realise to the full the difficulty of attacking individual items ofexpenditure.   The defence estimate for 1953 is agreed.   I do not seek to re-openit.   Instead, i as&apos;* that we should face the implications of what we are doing.We are seeking to have both guns and butter - a large defence expenditure,fulfilment of world-wide international obligations, expansion of exports, the copy NO. -,,*-/CABINET
P.T.Board of Trade, S.V.i.31st January, 1953.development of the Commonwealth, and growing provision of houses mostlybuilt with public funds and made available at subsidised rents, maintenanceof the most comprehensive social welfare services in Europe or perhaps theworld, the re-equipment of industry - and to combine all these with an advance towards a convertible currency.   i maintain my previously expressedopinion that w  are trying to do too much.   The burden is more than ourproductive industry can now sustain.6. While therefore i fully support the particular proposals for economyset out by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his paper i feel we should askourselves:-(i) whether these proposals go far enough so far as supply expenditure in 1953/54 is concerned; and(ii)   whether we have yet fully faced the magnitude of the changes of policy which are essential if we are to getour economy on a sound basis.
Printed, for the Cabinet.   February 1953SECRET Copy No.    (JC. (S3) 352nd February, 1953CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Power.I.  The Cabinet were informed on 14th January (C.C (53) 2nd Conclusions,Minute 8) that if a wage increase of the order of 6s. tW. a week were granted tothe lower-paid workers, the price of coal would have to be increased by 10 per cent. .as early as possible thereafter. -2. The National Coal Board estimate that their trading accounts for 1952will disclose a deficit of  8 millions which, we are informed, may be attributedlargely to increased wages costs in that year. They further estimate that, includingthe wages offer now under consideration and certain adjustments in piece workrates unavoidable under the existing conciliation machinery, a further addition ofsome  21 millions will be made to the wages burden in 1953. Furthermore areduction in the profitability of exports is already apparent and, when a modestallowance is made for this and for other inevitable&apos; changes in costs, the board would expect to suffer a net loss of  36 millions in 1953, if the present price levelwere maintained.  (Details are given in Appendix A.)3. Wages in the coal industry constitute the bulk nearly 70 per cent.-ofthe cost of production and, if a deficit on the Board&apos;s operations is to be avoided,any material increase in wage levels necessitates a price increase. It is important that this should be emphasised in the public mind by linking the announcement ofa price increase with a wages increase, and consequently, if the Board reach thesettlement with the miners expected on 12th February, any price increase we agree upon should be announced immediately and should operate as soon as practicablethereafter. It is expected that the increase could be effective within a few days forall except domestic coals, for which the new prices would be applied a fortnightlater.4. The Board propose a price increase of 10 per cent, from those dates equivalent to an average increase of 5s. 6d. a ton. Increases to individual classesof consumers would depend on the quality.of the coal supplied but for domesticcoal the increase would average 6s. Qd. a ton and for coal for the railways 5s. 9d.a ton. Possible effects on the prices of coke, gas, steel, &amp;c. are listed in Appendix B.5. This increase in&apos;the price of coal would produce additional revenue of 44 millions for the Board in 1953, but after allowing for tax payments (and theBoard has to pay even when the accounts show a trading loss) there would stillbe a deficit of about  1 million on the year&apos;s trading. The Board have been carrying forward deficits for six successive years the deficit now stands at 14 millions despite the fact that these years have been good years in terms of demand. The years ahead may be leaner and there is a strong feeling on the board that they would be failing in their statutory duty to balance revenue and expendi-ture over an average of good and bad years if the financial position were allowedto deteriorate any further. Regrettable though the necessity may be, we*feel in thecircumstances that the proposed increase of 10 per cent, is justified and should beagreed. . . &quot;-       43657 &quot;;&apos;        :       &quot;     &apos; -&apos;: ;.
