Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1953SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 392nd February, 1953CABINETHOUSE OF LORDS REFORMNote by the Prime minister circulate for consideration by the Cabinet a draft letter to the Leaders of theOpposition Parties which has been drawn up by theEord President of the Councilin accordance with the decision taken by the Cabinet on 30th December.W. SC.10 Downing Street, S.W.1,2nd February, 1953[p.t.o.
DRAFT LETTERAs you know, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have announced their intention to invite the Leaders of the other main political Parties to consider the question ofthe reform of the House of Lords. It has long been held by the Conservative party that such a review is urgently required, if the House is to play its proper part as aSecond Chamber under the Constitution, and it is clear that, if such a reform canbe achieved by agreement between the Parties, so much the better.It was for this reason that in 1947, during the debates on the Parliament Bill atthat time before the House of Lords, the Conservative Party, with the support ofboth wings of the Liberal Party, urged on the Labour Government of the day thedesirability of All-Party Conversations, covering both the composition and powersof the House. The Labour Government were good enough to agree to this pro-posal, and the conversations took place and achieved a not inconsiderable measureof success. But it was unhappily found impossible to register a sufficient measureof agreement to justify the Leaders of the Parties concerned, who had been nego-tiating ad referendum, in submitting joint proposals to their Parties.It appears to Her Majesty&apos;s present advisers that the time has now come tomake a further attempt.   I therefore write, on behalf of Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-.   .      ,    Labour -    . , .ment,  to mvite the --------Party  to take part in further conversations.LiberalFollowing the precedent of 1947, these would be at first of an informal character,to see whether a sufficient area of agreement exists to justify the holding of a moreformal Conference.I greatly hope that your Party will find it possible to accept this invitation,which is sent to them in a sincere desire to achieve an agreed and enduring solutionof this long-standing and difficult problem, to the advantage of Parliament andthe Nation.I am also sending an invitation to the Leader of the ^^ouy party.Liberal      J
