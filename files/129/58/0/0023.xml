Copy No.   7 9CABINETHOUSING policy memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government&quot; Grant that we may both perceive and know what things,we ought to do, and also have grace and power faithfullyto fulfil the same.&quot;&quot; Quern deus vult perdere, prius dementat . . . .&quot;Here are three papers. Together they form a grand design for Housing.The first (C. (53) 24) is called &quot; Houses-Old and New.&quot;  It sets out a broadplan for the future.2.   But, as a first step, we must have (a) a new system of valuation for rating;(b) an interim measure for increase of rents.3. So the two other papers (C. (53) 25 and C. (53) 26) set out the basis forthese measures, and ask for authority to have the Bills drafted.4. But I do not want to introduce an interim Rent Bill except as part of a wider policy. So I would like the support of the Cabinet for the whole plan. Thiswill be published in a White Paper, to accompany the Rent Bill.5. Even so, I must warn my colleagues that to adopt any general measure for the increase of rents is a bold and hazardous undertaking.6. I should be grateful for assistance and guidance on the details of the plan to be adopted.Everything will depend on the scheme not merely being fair, but seeming tobe fair.For myself, after wandering for fourteen months among these wretched trees,I can scarcely see the wood at all.H. M.Ministry of Housing and Local Government, S.W. 1,22nd January, 1953.confidential. (53) 2322nd January, 195343575Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953.
