(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL.C. (53) 3fc3rd FEBRUARY, 1953.COPY NO.     J    ICABINETVOTE PROVISION FOR THE ARGENTINE CREDIT.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I wish to refer for the decision of my colleagues the question which department should carry on its Vote a provision to meet possible drawings byArgentina on the short-term credit of  20 millions available up to December 1954,provided under the recent Agreement.2. As my colleagues will be aware, provision of  10 millions has beenmade in a Foreign Office Supplementary Estimate to cover possible drawingsup to 31st March, 1953,   But this has been done on the understanding that thequestion of which Department should bear the charge after that date should bereferred to Ministers for decision.   It is now a matter of urgency to reachthat decision, since the Civil Estimates for 1953/54 will shortly close.3. The Foreign Secretary considers that it is undesirable for the ForeignOffice to bear this charge, for reasons which he has summarised in correspondence as follows(i) that this credit is different in nature from any Grants in Aid toforeign countries (for political reasons) which are borne at present on the Foreign Office Grants and Services Vote;(ii) that it is undesirable to give a credit, granted in order to obtain a trade agreement, the status of a political loan.   The fact of itsappearance on the Foreign Office Grants and Services Vote musttend to give that impression;(iii)that its order of magnitude completely distorts the Foreign OfficeGrants and Services Vote.4. I may at this stage mention that, before the decision was taken toprovide this money from Votes, I had considered whether the money couldnot be provided by means of sterling/peso swaps, which was one of thepossibilities mentioned in a confidential letter annexed to the 1951 Protocol.I came to the conclusion that to do so would constitute an improper use of theExchange Equalisation Account and that the 1951 provisions, which were only accepted under Argentine duress, should not be repeated.5. As requested at the Cabinet meeting of 3rd December (C.C.(52) 101stConclusions, Minute 7) I have given very careful consideration to alternative sources of funds, and have come to the conclusion that no Department other thanthe Foreign Office could properly make provision in its Votes without specificlegislation.   Possible candidates are the Ministry of Food, the Board of Tradeand the Treasury.
6. In accordance with its existing functions, the Ministry of Food can onlyproperly give a commercial credit to a foreign country if such an operationarises out of its normal activities as a trading Department.   The Ministry of Foodcould therefore only take the charge on its existing Votes if the operationcould be described as an advance payment for meat.   This would involvetreating as an advance payment a payment which might be required in theyear 1953/54 and, after it had been repaid in meat supplies, might have to be renewed the following year against future supplies.   This would hardly be a practicable arrangement, since the Agreement only covers meat supplies for 1953, whereas the credit can be drawn upon up to June 1954;  and inany case a somewhat similar use of Ministry of Food Votes for an advancepayment in the Andes Agreement, in the time of the Labour Government, was severely criticised by the then Opposition.   To use the Ministry of Foodtherefore would require a separate Vote which could not be set up withoutspecific legislation to extend the statutory functions of the Ministry.7. There is already specific machinery provided by the Exports CreditsGuarantees Acts of 1949 and 1951 by means of which the Board of Trade maymake advances to foreign countries for the promotion of exports, by payments under Special Guarantees.   In the present case, the use of this machinery was ruled out from the beginning by the knowledge that the Argentines wouldin no circumstances consent to put themselves under its restrictions.   Itwould be quite wrong for the Board of Trade to provide credits otherwise than under the Exports Credits Guarantees Acts without further specificlegislation.8. In the case of the Treasury a new Vote would certainly be required.Although the Treasury has been given by various Statutes certain specificfinancial powers in regard to lending and guarantees, it is not a spending orlending Department.   As a matter of constitutional propriety, I aim advised that the Treasury could not provide for this charge on its existing Votes, andwould require to set up a new Vote under the authority of specific legislationprecisely defining the purposes for which it should be used.9.        Apart from the obvious difficulty of finding time in the parliamentary programme to promote the legislation necessary to open new Votes for any of theabove three Departments, there is no doubt that its unusual character would attract a great deal of undesirable publicity.    I also believe that there arereasons of policy against introducing legislation of this kind at this time.    Inthe case of the Ministry of Food, we do not wish to extend its functions;  in thecase of the Board of Trade, it would be undesirable to provide powers parallelto those which already exist, merely because a single country is sensitive to the implications of using existing procedure;   in the case of the Treasury, the role of banker is wholly inappropriate.10.        There is a further general objection to legislation in this matter.    TheForeign Secretary has said in correspondence that this is likely to be a continuingproblem in foreign commercial negotiations for which specific le gislativeprovision should be made.    But I find it difficult to agree with this view.    Onlythe Argentine, and possibly Uruguay, are involved at present, and I know of noother countries where this problem is likely to arise in anything like the sameform.    I believe that Parliament would, in any case, be most reluctant to confergeneral powers of the kind involved, which would be exceedingly difficult to defineand to limit, on any spending Department, and I am bound to say that in my view it would be most undesirable to advertise to the world that we are prepared toconsider credit to foreign countries as a general policy;  and I do not feel thatsuch a proceeding would be justified by present circumstances.    The alternative
is to legislate specifically for the case of the Argentine, and possibly also for Uruguay;  but specific legislation to deal with one, or at the mosttwo isolated cases of short-term credit which will expire by the end of next year, would be a waste  of Parliamentary time which should not beaccepted unless there is no reasonable alternative.11.       In case it is decided to proceed with such legislation, I maysay that the decision to do so would be sufficient authority for theinclusion of the appropriate amount in the Estimates of the Departmentselected.   But it would be proper to introduce the necessary Bill before the presentation of the Estimates towards the end of February;  and itwould be essential that the legislation should be passed not later than the appropriation Act in July, or early August.12.       But I feel bound to recommend to my  colleagues that provision to meet the Argentine credit should be made on the Foreign Office Grants and services Vote, in which it can be included without legislation.   I fullyvalue    the weight of the arguments put forward against this course by theForeign Secretary, but I do not believe that the use of the Foreign OfficeVote is wholly inappropriate or incapable of being defended, and I shall ofcourse be prepared to take my part in its defence.   The alternative, onthe other hand, seems to me to present such difficulties and dangers thatit should not be contemplated.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.3rd February, 1953.
