Printed, for the Cabinet.   February ,1953SECRET Copy No.    6C. (53) 352nd February, 1953CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Power.1. The Cabinet were informed on 14th January (C.C. (53) 2nd Conclusions,Minute 8) that if a wage increase of the order of 6,s. Od. a week were granted tothe lower-paid workers, the price of coal would have to be increased by 10 per cent,as early as possible thereafter. - - -   -2. The National Coal Board estimate that their trading,accounts for 1952will disclose a deficit of  8 millions which, we are informed, may be attributedlargely to increased wages costs in that year. They further estimate that, includingthe wages offer now under consideration and certain adjustments in piece workrates unavoidable under the existing conciliation machinery, a further addition ofsome  21 millions will be made to the wages burden in 1953. Furthermore areduction in the profitability of exports is already apparent and, when a modestallowance is made for this and for other inevitable changes in costs, the board would expect to suffer a net loss of  36 millions in 1953, if the present price levelwere maintained.  (Details are given in Appendix A.)3. Wages in the coal industry constitute the bulk nearly 70 per cent. ofthe cost of production and, if a deficit on the Board&apos;s operations is to be avoided,any material incre,ase in wage levels necessitates a price increase. It is important that this should be emphasised in the public mind by linking the announcement ofa price increase with a wages increase, and consequently, if the Board reach thesettlement with the miners expected on 12th February, any price increase we agree upon should be announced immediately and should operate as soon as practicablethereafter. It is expected that the increase could be effective within a few days forall except domestic coals, for which the new prices would be applied a fortnightlater.4. The Board propose a price increase of 10 per cent, from those dates equivalent to an average increase of 5s. 6d. a ton. Increases to individual classesof consumers would depend on the quality,of the coal supplied but for. domesticcoal the increase would average 6s. Od. a ton and for coal for the railways 5s. 9d.a ton. Possible effects on the prices of coke, gas, steel, &amp;c. are listed in Appendix B.5. This1 increase in the price of coal would produce additional revenue of 44 millions for the Board in 1953, but after allowing for tax payments (and theBoard has to pay even when the accounts show a trading loss) there would stillbe a deficit of about  1 million on the year&apos;s trading. The Board have been carrying forward deficits for six successive years the deficit now stands at 14 millions despite the fact that these years have been good years in terms of demand. The years ahead may be leaner and there is a strong feeling on the board that they would be failing in their statutory duty to balance revenue and expend! -ture over an average of good and bad years if the financial position were allowedto deteriorate any further. &apos; Regrettable though the necessity may be, we feel in thecircumstances that the proposed increase of 10 per cent, is justified and should beagreed.43657
6. We ask for Cabinet authority therefore to inform the National Coal board that, under the informal arrangement for consultation with the Government aboutcoal prices that has been followed in past years, we agree to the proposed increaseof 10 per cent, in the price of coal, to be announced immediately after12th February,,assuming that a wage settlement is reached between the Board andthe miners on that date.L.;, -       . ,,. ,vfevi.;i G.

41CONSEQUENCES OF AN INCREASE OF 10 PER CENT. IN THEPRICE OF COALA general increase of 10 per cent, in the price of coal would involve an average increase of 5s. 6d. a ton, and average increases on particular grades of coal asfollows:  6s. Od. a ton on coal for gas works;6s. Od. a ton on domestic coal;5s. 9d. a ton on coke oven supplies;45. 6d. a ton on electricity supplies,and (possibly) 5s. 9d. a ton on railway supplies.Consequential results might be:  95. Od. a ton on gas coke;85. Sd. a ton on hard coke;\d. per therm on gas prices;4 per cent, on most industrial electricity prices (and possibly some 3 percent, on all electricity prices);75. Od. a ton on steel; 4 millions (about) on railway costs.
