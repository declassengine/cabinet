v 4o(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(53) 1210TH JANUARY, 1953CABINETDECONTROL OF FEE DINGS TUFFS AND CEREALSMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture andFisheries and the Minister of food on 13th November (C.C.(52) 96th Conclusions, Minute 4) the cabinet authorised us to discuss with representatives of the farmers and the trades concerned the details of the scheme we had submitted in C. (52) 401 for with-drawing the Exchequer subsidy on animal feedingstuffs and ending the existing schemes for rationing, price control and Government trading in feedingstuffsand cereals.    We now report the results of these discussions (details are givenin Appendix II) and seek authority for a statement of the Government^ decision in the terms of the draft at Appendix I.Attitude of the trade .        Consultation with the Trade Associations has shown that traders, likethe Farmers1 Unions, are anxious that there shall be a reasonable equationbetween demand and supply after decontrol.    Apart from this, it has thrown upno problems that were not anticipated and that are not inherent in the processof decontrol whenever it is undertaken.    There will, of course, be problems forthe trade to overcome in financing stocks at present price levels;  and thereare questions of technique still to be settled regarding the control of imports and the use of foreign exchange.    In general the Trade Associations accept the broad proposal to decontrol in the autumn of 1953.Bread and flour.        After decontrol the production of white flour at extraction rates lower than that used for National flour would have to be permitted.    It is practicable,however, to add to the whiter flour the significant nutrients (so far as these can at present be identified) in which it is deficient, as well as the small quantity ofcalcium included in National flour.    This the millers will be required to do, andit provides a satisfactory safeguard of nutritional standards.4.        The flour subsidy would disappear (and those who bake at home willlose this assistance), but a subsidy on bread made from National flour willremain and the price of this bread will still be controlled - the level of thesubsidy being the main determining factor as at present.    Attention is drawn in paragraph &apos;9 of Appendix II to certain risks inherent in maintaining a high rate of subsidy under the proposed arrangements.;opy no.7?
51Attitude of Farmers1 Unions5.        The Farmers&apos; Unions are more nervous of the changes which wouldbe involved in decontrol than anxious to get rid of present controls.    Theirhesitations fall under three heads:-(a) They reiterate that they want costs kept down and thesubsidy retained until the market price has come downto the present subsidised level.    (They suggest that thesubsidy should be kept on after decontrol, which we aresatisfied is impossible.)(b) They want sufficient time for full consultation about themethods to be used after decontrol to implement theGovernments obligations as to prices and marketsunder the Agriculture Act.    We think that paragraph 4of Appendix I will meet them on this.(c) They are afraid of shortages, sharp price fluctuations andmaldistribution which would hurt particularly the small farmer.    These fears are examined in detail inAppendix II.    Our conclusion is that the formula inparagraph 8 of Appendix I constitutes a satisfactoryassurance.6.        It is within the power of the Government to influence the balance between demand and supply through the medium of the Farm Price Review.For this purpose a measure of under-recoupment of costs, as a working party of officials has recommended (C.(52) 40l),will no doubt have to be considered.With this further consideration in mind, we are confirmed in the view thatthe Government need not be deterred from decontrol by fear of a large rise in price or strong pressure to increase imports unduly, although there will be some change and probably at first some fluctuation in the prices of different kinds of feedingstuffs and in the relationship between them.conclusion.        It is essential that the Governments decision should be announced assoon as possible, and we seek our colleagues agreement that a statement shouldbe made in Parliament in the week beginning 19th January on the lines of appendix I.(Intld. )    T.L.D.G. LI. -G.10TH JANUARY, 1953.APPENDIX draft Statement1.        As the House was informed in answer to a question on 3rd December, 1952, the Government has been,consulting the representativesof farmers and the many trades concerned on the possibility of removing thepresent controls on the prices and supplies of all cereals and feedingstuffs,and returning imports to private trade.    Apart from the economy and increased efficiency in various directions   which should follow, an important
6ireason for this step is that the present feedingstuffs&apos; rationing scheme is unsatisfactory in several respects and is tending to break down.    In these consultations  particular attention has been given to this aspect of the matter,and to the importance of maintaining stable conditions in agriculture, as wellas to the effect on the price of bread of the removal of controls on cereals.2.        In the light of these consultations the Government has decided thatthe present controls should be brought to an end at the next harvest.3.        The removal of controls on cereals and the resumption of privateimports by the trade will make it necessary to remove the existing subsidy onflour and also to remove the restrictions on the type of flour which may beproduced.    But a National flour of 80 per cent extraction will continue to beproduced and the subsidy on bread made from this flour will be continued andmodified to take account of the disappearance of the flour subsidy.    Thesubsidised National loaf will also remain subject to price control.    Bread made from whiter flour of lower extraction will not be subsidised, nor will it besubject to price control.    This whiter flour will, however, be fortified by theaddition of nutrients equivalent to those lost in the further refining which itundergoes (so far as these can at present be identified) as well as the calciumwhich is already added to the National flour;   and this will ensure that freedom to produce whatever flour the public prefers will not result in any avoidablelowering of nutritional standards.4.        Later there will have to be some adjustments in th- method of implementing Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, for the four cereals&apos; crops.After decontrol there will no longer be maximum prices for cereals.     For the1953 harvest the Ministry of Food will remain ready to buy any suppliesoffered under existing arrangements.    Further, these arrangements willcontinue until the new permanent arrangements for implementing the price and market guarantees under the Agriculture Act, 1947  can be settled,after full and mature consultation with all the interests concerned,and brought intooperation.    It would clearly be appropriate, however, to establish as soon aspossible the permanent methods of implementing the Act in the new conditions.Preliminary discussion on this problem has already started with representativesof the Farmers&apos; Unions and will be continued with a view to establishing as soonas is reasonably practicable the most effective arrangements.5.        In the White Paper of last May on the Annual Review and Fixing of farm Prices, the Government stated that the,subsidy on feedingstuffs couldnot be continued indefinitely but would be kept on for a further year.    Thedecision now taken to remove controls makes it impossible to continue anyremaining subsidy required to hold prices at present levels after the nextharvest.and the Government has decided that the subsidy should be withdrawnon 1st April next.    The effect on farm costs will be one of the factors takeninto consideration at the forthcoming Annual Review.6.        It will be necessary to maintain control over the import of cerealsfrom outside the sterling area in order to safeguard the balance of payments.The Governments intention is to administer such control in a manner which gives importers the greatest possible freedom consistent with our balanceof payments&apos;needs to purchase their requirements in the most favourablecommercial conditions.    The system will be operated with the aim of checkingfrom the outset any tendency for non-dollar supplies to command premiumprices over supplies from the dollar area.7.        This will ensure that we shall not be dependent upon any one source,however important, and that adequate supplies, so far as we can afford to buythem, will always be available at world prices.    In these circumstances  itwould clearly be unnecessary and undesirable to contemplate the creation
41of a reserve stock, for such a stock would overhang the market anddiscourage the re-establishment of private trade upon a stable basis, besidesincreasing prices by adding to the overhead costs of handling supplies.Satisfactory stocks will, in any event, be available in the country at the dateof decontrol.8.        The rate of imports authorised after decontrol will in any case besufficient to maintain the present supply of feedingstuffs.    The government also expect that farmers will increase home production of animal feedingstuffs,thus providing a net addition to total supplies.    The current livestock expansion programme which was laid down in the White Paper issued after the 1952 annual review assumes that the addition to the livestock population will be supportedentirely from additional home produced feedingstuffs.    But in the early stages of decontrol the expansion of home production of feedingstuffs may not keepexactly in step with the expansion of the livestock population.    For this reason,during the first year after the end of feedingstuffs1 rationing, the Governmentwill be prepared, in the event of any critical shortage of supplies leading to aserious upward tendency of prices, to consider authorising such additional imports as may be needed to maintain a livestock population which is expandingin conformity with the White Paper programme.9. There will be further discussions of the detailed arrangements with allthe interests concerned.APPENDIX IIProgress ReportConsultations with the trade. The outline of the scheme for decontrol was given to representativesof the twenty-two Trade Associations principally concerned.    Four Associationshave given unqualified approval and sixteen qualified approval;  two are opposedto decontrol.2.        The following are the principal matters on which certain trade associations have displayed some anxiety:-(a) Supplies.    The Trade wish to be assured that the volume ofhome produced and imported supplies will be sufficientto meet the farmers1 needs.(b) Import Control.    The Trade Associations reluctantlyaccept the need in present conditions for a measure ofcontrol of imports and foreign exchange expenditure.But they are naturally concerned about the precisemethod by which the control will be exercised, andsome Associations will attempt to secure protection for sectional interests.        The essential need is to devise a system which places the minimum restraintupon legitimate trading activities and allows themaximum degree of flexibility consistent with the need to regulate imports.    A free and continuous flow of imported supplies of cereals and feedingstuffs is vital to the success of the whole operation of decontrol.A provisional scheme is being prepared by the Ministryof Food for the consideration of the other Departmentsconcerned.
Go(c)    Finance,   The Trades show a general anxiety about their ability to finance their businesses at present day prices.    Under control they have been unable tobuild up reserves and they must therefore look to the banks for the necessary accommodation.    OneAssociation goes so far as to suggest that the Govern-ment should pay a capital sum to the Trade to offset the increase in commodity prices compared with pre-war.    As another aspect of the same problem there is some concern about the ability of the Trade to carry the risks of a fall in prices with their existing resources.Subsidiary points of a similar character affectingparticular sections of the Trade are also raised and call for examination by the Ministry in consultationwith the Trades concerned.3.        In general the Trade Associations may be said to accept the broadproposal to decontrol cereals and feedingstuffs in the autumn of 1953.    their observations follow the pattern which had been expected and no new point ofimportance has emerged in the recent discussions.    Most of the Associationsseek assurances of one kind or another;  some ask for restrictive devices andsystems of allocation designed to protect sectional interests.    Generallyspeaking these requests could not be conceded,since to do so would be inconsistent with the policy of a return to private enterprise.    It is not expected that there will be any insuperable difficulty in dealing effectively with these questions.     They are largely bred of a fear of the unknown.4.        The problems raised by the Trade Associations are implicit indecontrol at anytime , whether now or at some date in the future, and do not warrant reconsideration of the proposal to decontrol, provided that the volumeof home produced and imported supplies of cereals and feedingstuffs is sufficient at all times to satisfy demand at reasonable prices.    It is withinthe power of the Government to influence this balance by restricting demand to the level which can be afforded in terms of foreign exchange through under-recoupment of costs at the Annual Review.Effects on Bread5.        Flour composition.    National flour will, as at present, consist whollyof wheat flour of not less than 80 per cent extraction with certain otherauthorised ingredients.     Flour&apos; at this rate of extraction automatically contains the minimum quantities of certain nutrients, notably iron, thiamin and nicotinicacid, considered by scientists to be necessary for the health of the public.Flour at lower rates of extraction, however, will be deficient in these nutrientsand it is therefore proposed to require millers to incorporate in all such flourthe balance of the nutrients required.    Thus^the intention is that all flour sold in this country for whatever purpose will be required to contain minimum levels of these significant nutrients as well as the small proportion of calciumat present included in National flour.6.        The extent of the demand for &quot;white flour&quot; is unpredictable.    Inparagraph 15 of the Appendix to C. (52) 401 it was stated that if demand for white flour products &quot;apart from the National loaf&quot; proved to be as great asin pre-war years, it might be necessary to import additional wheat to the extentof 400,000 tons a year.    it war: expected however that the actual figure wouldbe much less and whatever the figure the same amount of extra wheat offalswould become available as feedingstuffs.    On the assumption that the wheatwould have to be bought at non-International Wheat Prices, it might cost 7 per ton more than coarse grain.    The effect on balance of payments would therefore not be more than  3 millions in dollars.
feV7.        Bread subsidy.   A subsidy on the National loaf will remain and thiswill involve the continued control of its price.    With flour prices decontrolled,bakers would buy their flour at prices which would vary according to the quantities purchased and the distance of the baker from the flour mill.    Thesmaller bakers, many of whom are in areas remote from the large port mills,would suffer on both counts and it would not be possible so long as Nationalbread is controlled at a single price all over the country to maintain the presentflat rate system of bread subsidy.    But neither would it be practicable to haveregional controlled prices of bread as obtained under the looser non-statutory control exercised by the Food Council before the war, nor regional rates of subsidy,since both would be bound to produce serious anomalies.    The solutionproposed is a differential subsidy according to the size of the baker&apos;s business.This is something which the smaller bakers have long sought and which wouldcertainly go far to relieve cases of hardship.8.        If all bakers were to receive an additional subsidy of 2s. 6d. per sackon the first 200 sacks per week Qf National flour used by them in the productionof National bread, the extra cost of the baking subsidy would not exceed 1^:millions per annum and might be appreciably less than this, depending on theswitch from National to non-subsidised bread following decontrol.    All but300 bakers (out of 14,500 at present claiming subsidy) would have all their national bread subsidised by the additional 2s. 6d. per sack and they nowproduce between them about 45 per cent of the subsidised bread.    Theadditional 2s. 6d. per sack would, it is estimated, cover any likely increasein the delivered cost of flour to remote bakers, together with reasonablecompensation for the quantity discount which the smaller baker would be unableto secure.    Thus these arrangements would enable us to maintain a uniformcontrolled price for National bread, as at present, and the actual price prevail-ing from time to time would, as at present, depend on decisions about the rateof subsidy.9.        Under these conditions, bakers will have some opportunity for cheating,since it will not be practicable to check the use of small quantities of Nationalflour in &quot;white&quot; loaves sold by bakers at uncontrolled prices, and this may leadto submission of inflated subsidy claims based on the use of all their Nationalflour to make National loaves.    The public will be protected by maintaining the requirement that National bread must be available wherever non-subsidisedbread is on sale;   but the only effective way of avoiding inflation of subsidyclaims would be to reduce the temptation by reducing the rate of subsidy, atthe expense of some increase in the price of national bread.Consultation with the National Farmers&apos; Unions10.        The National Farmers&apos; Unions have said that derationing in 1953.will create intolerable risks for their members unless the Government willprovide for the first year a buffer stock of 2/2j million tons - that is to say,getting on for half of the present &quot;ration pool&quot; of 5j million tons.    Thisproposal is unnecessary and in any case it is out of the question for financial and other practical reasons.11. They have not spelt out these risks precisely except on three points:-(a) The financially stronger farmers will buy up feedingstuffsto the detriment of the weaker farmers.(b) The consequent price rise will drive up costs of production for livestock farmers generally, thus further distortingthe balance of income between livestock and cropfarmers.
(c)   The feedings-tuffs1 trade lacks recent experience in buyingin foreign markets, and may also be short of finance,so that imports on private account may fall short ofneeds.12.        The following paragraphs attempt to weigh the risks and to indicatewhat measures could or should be taken to afford safeguards.13.        A Bad Harvest.    The biggest single risk is that of a bad harvest athome in 1953.    This could diminish supplies by anything up to 1 million tons.It is the business of farmers to bear that sort of risk, and on no previous occasions of bad harvest have additional imports been made on that account.Nevertheless, in the present context a bad harvest would have the same effect as a shortage for any other reason.14.        The &quot;Agricultural Fringe&quot;.   An appreciable part of the existing rationsis issued to small pig and poultry keepers and other people who are not farmers.These may start off by buying more feedingsfuffs as soon as they can be freelybought, whatever the price within reason, so as to keep more stock or to avoid the nuisance of boiling swill, etc.15.        Increased Buying on Decontrol.    Many farmers find the existing ration -ing scheme a restraint on their scale of operations.    Taking together allclasses of coupon recipients, it is thought that the rationing scheme is restrain-ing demand to an extent between 5 and 10 per cent.    More detailed estimates for particular classes of livestock are given below:-(i)     Pigs.    It would be prudent to allow for the possibilityof an expansion of pigs on the same scale and timingas that engendered by the launching of the agriculturalexpansion programme of 1947.(ii)     Poultry.     We allow for the possibility of a 10 per centexpansion over two years, this to be the outcome partly of unlimited purchase of feedingstuffs and partly of price decontrol of eggs.(iii) Cattle. Provision must be made for the increased, feedrequirements of cattle in accordance with the Govern-ment&apos;s announced production objectives.16.        There may be some further decline in horse numbers, and there isscope, even over two years, for the replacement,, in cattle feeding, of bulky forconcentrated feeds.    The statistical prospect of this stage can be put intabular form:-TABLE 1Additional requirements in terms of grain equivalent - 000 tonsIncrease in 1953/54    Increase in 1954/55over 1952/53 over 1953/54PigsPoultryOther StockLess Savings8514014036565300185150100435100335
fc317.        There are two sources within the agricultural industry of additional supplies of concentrated feedingstuffs to set against these requirements.    Thesmaller of the two is higher yields of crops per acre in the ordinary course of technical progress.    The larger is an increase in the tillage area.18.        For 1953/54 (i. e, the 1953 harvest) we think it not unreasonable tobudget for an increase in tillage of 250,000 acres - a figure with which theNational Farmers1 Unions agree and which appears to be within our grasp inconsequence of a favourable autumn for ploughing-up and the continued stimulusof the grant offered for that purpose.    For the 1954 harvest we may not be ableto count on anything more than a further 100,000 acres.    Increase in the tillagearea should produce concentrated feed at the rate of about 70 tons per 100 acres.19.        The statistical picture on the supply side to this stage is therefore:-TABLE 2Additional supplies in terms of grain equivalent - 000 tonsIncrease in 1953/54   Increase in 1954/55over 1952/53 over 1953/54Extra TillageIncrease d yieldsper acreShortfall at this stage 75 19020.       It should be emphasised that none of these figures - and least of allthe difference item in the last line above - are predictions.    The most that the tables can do is to give an indication of the extent of the risk for which it isprudent to allow.    It will be noted that the risk works out at a higher figure for1954/55 than for 1953/54 so far as the more measurable quantities are concerned,but on the other hand the imponderables - such as any impulses to buy feeding-stuffs simply because they are off ration - would probably operate chiefly in thefirst year.21.        Possible Reserves Against Deficiencies.     First of all, the Chancellorof the Exchequer has agreed to contemplate additional import licences, if required, up to  10 millions for one year only.    This would represent at least300,000 tons.22.       Secondly, the stocks carried by the Ministry of Food are likely, at thedate of decontrol, to be greater by some 250,000 tons than the Trade will be disposed to maintain after derationing.    This extra amount arises from therigidity of the feedingstuffs1 rationing system.23.        For present purposes it seems, therefore, that we can count on some550,000 tons from these two sources to set against a deficiency of 265,000 tonsover the two years 1953/4 and 1954/5.24.        Financial Easements.    The Farmers&apos; Union attach much importance.,in their objections to derationing, to the difficulties they foresee for the smallproducers of milk, pigs and eggs.    Many of these are dependent beyond theaverage on purchased feedingstuffs and would suffer unduly from any price risecaused by shortage.    We do not favour any form of subsidy on the feedingstuffspurchased by these people.  , Quite apart from any objections of principle, thereare serious administrative difficulties.    We do, however, think that much1752257075145
advantage - both for our negotiations with the National Farmers&apos; Unions andin maintaining the level of production in this sector of the agricultural economycould be made to flow from a modest addition to the funds available for the marginal Production Scheme.     Under the Scheme, grants can be given to farmers for various forms of improvement in their land or husbandry, whichover a period of a few years should make them more self-sufficient in feeding-stuffs.25.        We are therefore considering an addition to the Marginal ProductionScheme, on a United Kingdom basis, of  500,000 a year for four years, this amount to be a charge against any award of higher gross income to farmersafter the next Annual Review.    While the expenditure of this money would not significantly relieve the pressure on feedingstuffs&apos;supplies in 1953/54 and1954/55, it would not only be worth doing in its own right but would, we are confident, materially help to float the derationing operation.26.        With the aid of this and the other measures discussed, we see areasonable prospect of bringing the farming community to accept derationingand decontrol v/ithout setting up resistances that might impede the agricultural production drive.
