Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 9C. (53) 373rd February, 1953CABINETPEKING ECONOMIC CONFERENCE :  ADVICE TO BRITISH FIRMSON ATTENDANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and thePresident of the Board of TradeAn economic conference is to be held in Peking this Spring On the lines ofthe economic conference held in Moscow last year. It appears to be the intentionto hold an international economic conference of this kind under Communistdirection each year. The Communist-controlled &quot; British Council for the Pro-motion of International Trade,&quot; which was set up after the Moscow EconomicConference and is its continuing organisation in this country, is already issuinginvitations to British businessmen, as well as to Chambers of Commerce and trade associations to attend the Peking conference. The Federated British Industries,the China Association (representing British firms in the China trade), and someindividual firms have asked the Foreign Office, Board of Trade and Ministry ofTransport for advice.2. The British firms connected with the China trade are in a dilemma.Attendance at the Peking conference might expose them to criticism which would damage their interests in the United States and elsewhere. On the other hand theeffect of not attending might be merely to divert legitimate trade into less respectablechannels, if not away from the United Kingdom altogether. Most of the firmstherefore would like Her Majesty&apos;s Government to take the decision out of their hands and to give them firm advice. The ship-owning companies in particular are anxious for a clear lead. One of the biggest manufacturers of textile machinery in this country, Platt Brothers, have already decided to send a senior representative to the conference.3. We must recognise that the economic conference to be held at Peking isa manoeuvre in a political warfare campaign directed against this country and itsJriends; and that the attendance of solid and reputable British businessmen under&quot;the auspices of what is demonstrably a part of the Peace Campaign will give thewhole Peace Movement a new stimulus. On the other hand, it is true that, for what it is worth, the Movement would equally seek to exploit Government actionin discouraging British businessmen from attending. Moreover, we may expect the Chinese to make use of the conference to put forward genuine offers of tradedeals. If all our more reputable firms stay away from the conference,, the fieldwill be left open to fellow-travellers and others who will make propaganda out oftheir successes and may use the openings given them at the conference to circumventour strategic controls. We have repeatedly proclaimed our readiness to trade with china within the limits of our strategic controls. If responsible businessmen attend the conference and trade results, it will be an advantage both to our manufacturers and to ancillary services such as shipping; if no trade results, they can then expose the futility of the conference convincingly to the press and public in this country.We must indeed expect criticism in the United States if British businessmen attend the conference with our consent, especially if trade results; but we must alwaysexpect American criticism of trade between this country and China.43661
Foreign Office, S.W.1,3rd February, 1953.Recommendations     &quot;    ;-;-v^v&apos; . .i4. We recommend to our colleagues that our advice to firms who consult usabout attending the Conference at Peking should be on the following lines:  ,(i),The Peking Conference is one of a series of moves in a political warfare&apos;campaign directed by the Communists against the interests of&apos; thiscountry and its friends. Those who go should be on their guard againstthe pitfalls which will certainly be laid for them and should keep them-selves free from any continuing international organisation which maybe set up.(ii) Nevertheless, it is Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy to encouragelegitimate trade with China. If British firms think that their prospects of securing such trade would be advanced by sending representatives,we should make it clear that we do not wish to discourage them. Thefinal responsibility for the decision must of course rest with the firms,not with Her Majesty&apos;s Government. We should, however, discourageattendance by representatives of Chambers of Commerce and nationalassociations as this might be misrepresented as implying officialsponsorship.(iii) Departments will be glad to brief representatives to the Conference before their departure.5.   We should immediately inform friendly Governments of our decision.A. E.
