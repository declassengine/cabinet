(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret. (53) 48 COPY NO.      ^ b6th FEBRUARY, 1953.CABINETEAST-WEST TRADETRANS-SHIPMENT AND TRANSACTION controls memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade.At their meeting on 27th January (C.C.(53) 5th Conclusions, Minute 9)the Cabinet invited us to consider -(i) what measures could be taken short of imposing the financial controls suggested in C. (53) 21 to persuade the Dutch in particular to introduce trans-shipment licensing in order to close a gap in the control of the export of strategic goods to the Soviet bloc and China.We were also to report  -(ii) whether, if no other measures would suffice, legislation should be introduced imposing transaction controls, i. e. toprevent United Kingdom nationals from engaging in transactions which might lead to the export of strategic goods to theSoviet bloc and China.2. We are satisfied that the possibilities of tightening up existing controlshave not been adequately explored in the Paris Group or the effectiveness ofother countries&apos; financial controls sufficiently investigated.31 We think it convenient to set out in the following paragraphs a survey of the existing controls which do in fact impinge on transit trade.4. All members of the Paris Group agree that the exporting .country has the primary responsibility for ensuring that strategic goods licensedare exported to the permitted destination, arrive there, and are used for thepurpose declared to the licensing authority.5. It has been the United Kingdom view that the two most effectivemethods of preventing unauthorised diversion are the following(i)        The Import Certificate/Delivery Verification Scheme(the I.C./D.V. Scheme).Under this scheme the exporting country calls for an importcertificate from the country of destination, and the importerrenders himself liable to penalties if the goods are divertedwithout official approval.   Where necessary, the exporting country
arranges later for delivery verification to check that the goodsactually reached the permitted destination.   All countriesin the Paris Group operate this scheme.(ii)     Trans-shipment licensingUnder this scheme, not yet adopted by all the Paris Group countries,the trans-shipment of strategic goods in European ports would besubject to licence.   In spite of the importance of entrepot tradeto the United Kingdom, we introduced this control over a wide range of goods in November 1951, without waiting for all othercountries in the Paris Group to join with us.  At present theUnited States, Canada, Denmark, Italy and Norway claim toexercise trans-shipment control.   The Belgians have declared their willingness to introduce a measure of control.   The Dutchhave refused to introduce trans-shipment control.   It would, theymaintain, require legislation and would in particular interfere withthe facilities offered by the port of Rotterdam.   (This port is,of course, a gateway to Europe and the port through which strategic goods can easily be diverted to the Soviet bloc.)  The germans and French have indicated willingness to join in a general scheme,although they emphasise the difficulties it presents to them, andwe suspect that they are sheltering behind the firm resistance ofthe Dutch.6. Attitude of the Netherlands government it must be recognised that the Dutch have been conscientious membersof the Paris Group.   Nonetheless their opposition to trans-shipment licensingis probably due in part to their reluctance to prejudice the invisible earningsprovided by the transit facilities of Rotterdam.   On the other hand, it probablyis a matter of real political difficulty for them that they should be expected tointroduce legislation to control trans-shipment in their ports while foreignmerchants, including an increasing number of United Kingdom merchants, by/financing the transactions, enjoy in fact the major share of the profits which suchtransactions can produce.   They have been under constant pressure from othermembers of the Paris Group, including the Belgians, and the Americans havereinforced this pressure through diplomatic channels at The Hague, but there seems little prospect of a change in Dutch policy unless the United Kingdom offersto take part in some form of control over these merchanting activities.7. Alternative solutionsWe believe that, at the meeting beginning in Paris on 10th Februaryour experts can demonstrate the contribution which can be made by a furthertightening of existing controls.   A number of proposals for tightening theexisting physical controls are already under consideration, and we can showthat many of the present transit trade transactions could be prevented if -(i) export controls in the participating countries were morerigorously enforced, and(ii) these controls were reinforced more efficiently than at present by the I.C./D.V. system.We can also point to our present policy of persuading other major producers of strategic goods, who are not members of the Paris Group, to control their exports more effectively.   Thus it has just been agreed to use the I.C./D.V.system for exports from Yugoslavia to the United Kingdom.
8. There is, too, scope for demonstrating more convincingly that financial controls over the use of sterling would be inadequate from a securitypoint of view, as well as harmful to the international use of sterling, in whichmost members of the Paris Group have an immediate interest.9. A review of the whole problem of transit trade on these lines(including an examination of the financial controls which Continental countriesclaim to exercise) could well result in agreement on certain reinforcements to the existing physical controls.   It should also reveal more clearly the size of the gap which cannot be closed by physical controls and enable us to reach a clearer understanding than we have at present as to the method of closing the gap which is most likely to receive unanimous approval in the Paris Group.10, We recommend accordingly that experts from the Board of Trade,the Treasury and the Bank of England should join in the discussions beginningin Paris on 10th February for the purpose of convincing the Paris Group,on the basis set out in paragraphs 7 to 9 above of (a)  the possibilities of atightening up of existing controls and (b) the weakness of financial controls,11, Transaction controlsDuring the discussions in Paris, the Americans will presumablyannounce their willingness to introduce transaction controls and the Dutch will again press that we should introduce such controls,12. When Ministers considered this problem on 27th January it appeared that the introduction of transaction controls would involve legislation whichwould obviously be of a controversial nature.   But it now seems probable thatan adequate measure of control could be introduced without legislation under existing Defence Regulations,   The I.C./D.V. scheme was introduced under theDefence Regulations and their use for the purpose now suggested would not be new,13, Thus, an Order could be made under Regulation 55 of the defence regulations on the ground that it is necessary for the purpose of &quot;preventingsupplies or services being disposed of in a manner prejudicial to the defenceof any part of Her Majesty&apos;s Dominions, , , , or to peace and security in anypart of the world, &quot; Such an Order would prohibit the disposal of specifiedstrategic goods directly or indirectly to specified countries, which it would benecessary to list in the Order.   The Order would apply to the activities ofpersons in the United Kingdom and British subjects, wherever they may be (except the Dominions or other overseas, territories), notwithstanding that the goods arenever in this country,14. Before a final decision is reached on the introduction of controls ofthis kind, we think that officials should undertake a comprehensive examinationof their likely effects and the field that they should cover.   Although, however,this is a necessary safeguard, we are already satisfied that such controlswould be preferable to the financial controls described in C, (53) 21,   Theyshould be effective in preventing at any rate extensive traffic in strategic goodsby United Kingdom merchants and would not involve banking controls over theuse of sterling.15, Admittedly, an Order under the Defence Regulations specifying theforbidden destinations would still look like open discrimination against theSoviet bloc and China and could lead to a debate in Parliament,   The order would be subject to negative Resolution procedure.   On the other hand, it has been stated many times publicly that our strategic controls have the object of preventingcertain goods from reaching these destinations.   Moreover, the import certificatescheme which was introduced by Order under the Defence Regulations did notprovoke any public interest.
16. Transaction controls would have roughly the same commercial dis-advantage as financial controls.   They would be one more step towards an economicblockade and would result in a loss of invisible earnings because the Sovietcountries would turn to merchants outside the United Kingdom for the conduct of transactions not only in strategic goods but in non-strategic goods as well.17. No stage in the control of strategic goods will ever be adequate shortpf absolute blockade. It will always be possible to show that a little more tighteningup is necessary if the stage of control reached is to be made water-tight.18. Nonetheless it looks as if we must be prepared for this step.   If,however, we go further in this matter than other countries, we shall merelydivert trade to Continental competitors and bring no strategic advantage to theWest.   Accordingly, we strongly recommend that, whatever further controls wemay decide to accept, we should not this time (as we did in the case of trans-shipment controls) apply them more fully or more quickly than the other membersof the Paris Group.19. We recommend that the United Kingdom Delegation should be authorisedto say that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to consider the introduction of transaction controls as part of a general scheme for tightening existing controls;but that we would only do this if all other members of the Paris Group introduce -(i) trans-shipment controls in their ports;(ii) controls over the trading activities of their own nationals equivalent in effect to our suggested transaction controls.20, ConclusionWe recommend accordingly that at the Paris Group meeting which .begins on 10th February, the United Kingdom Delegation should(a) concentrate on(i) a review of the possibilities of dealing with the transit problem by tightening up existing controls, and(ii) an examination of the effectiveness of the financial controlsimposed by some other countries;  ..(b) indicate that Her Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to consider theintroduction of transaction controls provided that all other countries inthe Paris Group introduce(i) trans-shipment controls, and(ii) controls over the trading activities of their own nationals equivalentto our suggested transaction controls. ,21. We will consult our colleagues again on the basis of a report onthe forthcoming Paris meeting and of the further study of the likely effects of transaction controls and of the field that they might cover, which we suggestthat officials should undertake forthwith.R.A.B.P.T.6th February, 1953.
