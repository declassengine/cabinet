CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. g gC. (53) 509th February, 1953CABINETISRAELNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues may be interested to see the exchange of letters below, in whichthe Israel Foreign Minister expresses his thanks for the attitude taken by her majesty&apos;s Government in the recent United Nations debates on Palestine.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,9th February, 1953.Letter from Israel Minister for Foreign Affairs dated18th January, 1953Dear Mr. Eden,While it is still early to make a final assessment of the Palestine debate at theGeneral Assembly, it will, I believe, be generally agreed that the attempt made bythe Eight Powers to induce the parties to engage in direct negotiations was worthmaking, despite the failure of the draft resolution to command a two-thirds majority in the plenary session. The very fact that such weighty support was given to theproposal cannot in the long run fail to influence its opponents.The constructive and statesmanlike attitude taken up by the United KingdomGovernment, and so admirably presented to the Assembly by your Delegation(in particular in the speech by Lord Llewellin on 4th December, 1952) had amarked influence on the debates, and was in no small degree responsible for theadoption of the Draft Resolution in the Ad Hoc Political Committee.Believe me, dear Mr. Eden,Yours very sincerely,M. SHARETT.Reply to Israel Minister for Foreign Affairs from the Secretary of Statefor Foreign Affairs, dated 31st January, 1953Thank you very much for your letter of the 18th January.I am very grateful to you for your kind words on the Palestine debate at therecent General Assembly and I share your hope that the result will be beneficial.I shall not fail -to inform my colleagues of your generous reference to the speechmade by the Delegate of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.43693Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953
