SECRET Copy No.      g QC. (53) 2522nd January, 1953CABINETVALUATION FOR RATINGMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Housing and Local GovernmentFollowing the meeting of the Home Affairs Committee on 29th July last(H.A. (52) 23rd Meeting, Item 4), it was announced on 1st August that difficulties had been encountered in assessing dwelling-houses for rating in accordance withthe provisions of the Local Government Act, 1948, and that it had become clearthat Parliament would in due course have to amend those provisions. Valuationstaff would be employed on preliminary work to enable the Government to formu-late proposals.2. In the meantime an Act has been passed authorising further postponement of the new valuation lists; and an order has been made giving us till April 1955.to produce them. This date can be further postponed if necessary.3. Sample valuations have shown that the scheme of the Act of 1948 would produce anomalies and inequalities which would be indefensible. The right method&apos;is to provide that all houses, whenever built, should be assessed on the basis ofthe open market rental value. We are, however, pledged to maintain the basis of pre-war value for houses; and 1939 is in fact the latest date for which adequateevidence of normal rental values is available. We propose, therefore, that weshould now take as the basis of assessment for houses open market rental value in early 1939.4. There may be objections to reverting to the &quot; hypothetical tenant&quot; test;but it is the best and fairest. It was departed from in the 1948 Act mainly because&quot;satisfactory rental evidence was not then considered to be available for post-1918houses.&quot; Moreover, there had been trouble in 1939 from the fear that an up-to-datevaluation on the rental basis would cause hardship to many small occupiers. now that the data have been collated by Inland Revenue, it has been found that the spring of 1939 affords reasonable evidence of rents in a free market at a level whichwould not mean too heavy a rise in dwelling-house assessments. In all later periodsthe evidence is distorted by the absence of a free market.5. Ultimately it may be right that assessments should be related to currentrental value; but that cannot take place until 1960 or probably later. There willbe a re-valuation every five years.-6. It is important that legislation to this end should be introduced as soonas possible. The Valuation Office have started to collect evidence of the 1939 rentalvalues and need a statutory basis for what they are doing.7. After the revaluation is completed new lists will have to be published somesix months before they become operative in order to give an opportunity forobjections. The question in which year the new lists should become operative is something we shall have to consider nearer the time.43591Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953
8. There are a number of other points which should be dealt with in thesame Bill:  (a) A new Basis for Assessing Gas Undertakings. Nationalisation has madethe traditional basis exceedingly difficult and expensive to work. the traditional basis involves assessing the value of the undertaking by reference to the accounts for the whole; and then allocating the value as between the rating areas according to the distribution of the physicalassets. Following consultation with the Ministry of Fuel and Power,discussions are proceeding with the Gas Council and the Local authority associations to secure agreement on a new basis on lines broadly similarto those already applying to Electricity and Transport.(b) Appeals and Procedure-Simplification would command general accep-tance and secure economy. Under the present system, following aproposal to alter an assessment appeal has to be made separately afterdisagreement on the proposals has been recorded. It is now proposedto provide that an appeal should arise automatically on disagreementbeing registered.(c) Deductions from Gross to Net Values. Under the present law these applyto most categories of buildings and are fixed by Minister^ Order. Itis proposed in the Bill to bring London into line with the Provinces inthe treatment of the repairs to industrial premises, public utilities, &amp;c.;and also, possibly, to widen the existing powers to&apos; alter the scales ofdeduction from gross to net value,In due course the deductions should be overhauled in the light of changes in repair costs at particular rent levels. This will be a matter for Order after the Bill is passed.(d) Charities. It may be desirable to give local authorities wider powers- toremit rates for charities.9. There are a number of minor improvements which ought to be made tothe Rating and Valuation Acts, most of which would be quite uncontroversial,,though one or two might be queried by the Local Authorities. We would proposeto have these drafted; and we can consider whether to incorporate all or any ofthem in the Bill when we know the time-table.10. If our colleagues approve these proposals a Bill will be drafted immediately&apos;for introduction as and when opportunity arises.R. A. B.H. M.22nd January, 1953
