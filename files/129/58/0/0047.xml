Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953Copy No.   gCABINETGOVERNMENT expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have now held the first meeting of the group of Ministers appointed by theCabinet to review proposals for reducing Government expenditure in the coming financial year and to consider measures to secure further reductions in future years.We will deal with the latter part of our task at later meetings; but I want now tobring before the Cabinet the points for decision about reductions&apos; in the coming financial year.Food Subsidies2. We agree to recommend that the savings on butter, margarine and cookingfat, and milk, indicated in paragraph .16 of my memorandum (C. (53) 31), shouldbe made. The effect of this, together with the decontrol of eggs, feeding-stuffs and cereals, will be to reduce food subsidies to about the  200 millions level.3. Our views on the further reductions of food subsidies suggested inparagraph 17 are as follows:  (a) Sugar. We think that there may well be a case for an increase in theprice of sugar but a decision on this can be taken later.(b) Meat. We should like to make a saving of  8 millions by rearrangingthe price schedules of meat, but the Minister of Food would prefer that this saving should be realised in the course of the year.(c) Other Food Subsidies. Opinions were expressed in favour of reductions in other food subsidies, notably the non-welfare part of the milk subsidy.Against this view it was urged that milk was of great nutritional value,and that a sudden increase in the retail price would have a bad effect upon milk producers at a time when they were already uneasy aboutdecontrol of eggs, cereals and feeding-stuffs.4. I should add that the Minister of Labour regards any further reduction offood subsidies as dangerous, because he fears that any increase in the cost-of-living index will lead to a wage spiral. I myself recognise that we must not press thereduction of food subsidies now to a point which involves the risk of breakdown of our agricultural policy; we are having difficulties enough over the decontrolsalready announced.Increase in Prescription Charge5. We discussed the proposal to save  6 millions by insisting that each individual prescription should cost Is. I am prepared to support this proposal,but 1 understand the doubts of several of my colleagues about the wisdom of bringing in a stop-gap measure in advance of the enquiry into the National health service which the Cabinet have approved. It is, moreover, a substantial modifica-tion of the principle of Is. payment for prescriptions, which with great difficultywe persuaded Parliament to accept only a year ago. The Secretary of State forScotland feels that, if any change is made, it should still be accepted that only onefee should be payable when two or more drugs are prescribed for a single complaint.43675SECRETC. (53) 475th February, 1953
6. A decision on this proposal must be taken at once, if the change is to comeinto force by 1st March. Any delay would reduce the saving of  6 millions nextyear by  ^ million per month.Strategic Reserves7. The saving of  9 millions on strategic raw materials mentioned inC. (53) 31 goes forward. I should add that it seems probable that the limit of 46 millions which I had proposed for strategic stockpiling may in any case haveto be exceeded by some  7-8 millions to accomodate another material transferred from trading stocks.8. If the Cabinet decide to make the savings on the prescription charge andon the strategic reserves, these should be incorporated in the Vote-on-Accountfigures due to be published on 23rd February. It would perhaps be wiser&quot; to leaveall the reductions in the food subsidies for inclusion in the Budget, since it willbe difficult for the Minister of Food to explain, in advance of the Budget, why thesubsidy total is being reduced below the  250 millions level which I announcedlast year. But the deferment would mean that the Vote-on-Account figures willbe higher by some  35 millions ( 18 millions in paragraph 16 and  17 millions inparagraph 17 of C. (53) 31) than they would otherwise be if we decided to make all the subsidy reductionsPoints for Immediate Decision9. I will continue discussions with my colleagues on reductions in Govern-merit expenditure in future years and report to the Cabinet in due course. In themeantime I ask that the Cabinet shall take immediate decisions on the followingpoints:  (a) Is it agreed that we should make savings of  18 millions on butter,margarine and cooking fat, and milk?(b) Is it agreed that we should postpone any saving on sugar until, later?. (c) Should the saving of  8 millions on meat prices be announced in the courseof the year?(d) Should we examine further savings in food subsidies, notably non-welfare milk?(e) Should the increase in the prescription charge be made now, or should,we await the result of the enquiry into the National Health Service?(/) If this increase is to be made now, is the charge to apply to each individualprescription, or to the prescriptions for each individual complaint?-   (g) Is it agreed that we should save the  9 millions as proposed on strategicraw materials?R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,5th February, 1953.
