Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953SECRET Copy No. g gC. (53) 11st January, 1953CABINETPERSIANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate below, for the information of my colleagues, the text of a report received from the United States Embassy in London of a meeting between theU.S. Ambassador at Tehran and Dr. Musaddiq on 25th December, 1952.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,1st January, 1953.REPORT COMMUNICATED TO THE FOREIGN OFFICE BY THEU.S. EMBASSYAfter a long and difficult conversation with Ambassador Henderson on25 th December, Musaddiq tentatively offered to submit the question of compen-sation to arbitration by the International Court provided that the determination of the amount of compensation due should be based on any law carried out byany country for nationalising any of its industries which might be agreed to bythe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.). Henderson did not at any time suggest any method other than arbitration for settling the compensation question. Heoutlined plans for Phase Two for the movement of oil, including possible partici-pation of American companies to lift a quantity necessary to bring the total to asatisfactory level, which, he said, we thought would be in the neighbourhood of20 million tons. He made clear..that the companies would be reluctant, since allthe majors had adequate oil resources and would face financial and political problems if they bought oil from Iran, but he believed that they would co-operateif a settlement were reached on compensation and satisfactory commercial terms were agreed upon. He discussed tentative United States plans for advancingfunds to meet current Iranian budgetary and development needs provided that an oil settlement is reached, saying that the United States is tentatively prepared to buy oil and products to a value of approximately $.100 millions. Payment couldbe made immediately and the oil delivered to the United States Government overa period of years.Musaddiq suggested that the United States Government should buy oil atonce without awaiting settlement, saying that this would create an atmosphereconducive to a settlement. He added with great emotion that if the United states could not aid Iran until an oil settlement is reached, the Iranian situation wasdesperate. He did not believe that the British wanted a settlement, but insteadwould find pretext after pretext to postpone it. He thought the British Govern-ment was conspiring to overthrow the present Iranian Government. In the lightof Ambassador Henderson&apos;s exposition, he must immediately inform the Iranianpeople that they could expect help from no Western source and must look onlyto themselves to prevent national bankruptcy and to preserve Iran&apos;s independence.43459
Ambassador Henderson replied that the United States Government could not possibly buy Iranian oil until the matter of compensation had been disposed of.United States public would consider that to do so would be pursuing a policyof undermining the sanctity of international contracts. . Furthermore, it wouldbe impossible to obtain the necessary co-operation of the United States and inter-national business community. The Department was convinced that the BritishGovernment as well as the Iranian Government desired an early settlement.Instead of hesitating because of suspicions of British good faith, Musaddiq should concentrate on the compensation question.Musaddiq said he considered it useless to search for a further formula regardingterms of reference in the matter of arbitration. He had already made a numberof suggestions which for one reason or another had not been acceptable to theBritish. He referred to his past statements offering to settle compensation on termsno less liberal to A.I.O.C. than those on which compensation had been given to owners of property nationalised in other countries. Ambassador Hendersonpointed out that these offers all seemed to have strings attached, notably that theyreferred only to compensation for loss of physical property. As a matter ofprinciple, the British could not accept terms of reference which limited compen-sation to the loss which resulted from confiscation of the physical property in Iran.The position of the British on this was backed by virtually the entire business world.Musaddiq insisted that he had not intended to attach strings. In any case,he was still prepared to refer to the International Court for arbitration the matterof determination of the amount of compensation owed by Iran to A.I.O.C., due regard being given to Iranian counter-claims. The only terms of reference wouldbe that the International Court in determining the amount of compensation dueshould base itself on any law carried out by any country for nationalising itsindustries which might be agreed to by A.I.O.C.Ambassador Henderson asked if in making this offer Musaddiq realised thatthe British coal industry nationalisation act had provided for compensation for loss of future profits. Musaddiq replied that if British law provided for compen-sation for loss of future profits and if the International Court should decide to usethat law as a basis for determining the amount of compensation due, he would not object.Musaddiq added he would agree to such terms of reference provided theUnited States would simultaneously make arrangements to purchase Iranian oil to the amount of $100 millions and would make this amount at once available tothe Iranian Government. The purchase could be made through any company which the United States Government might designate and would be F.O.B. Iranianports. The price could be fixed on the basis of the Gulf price less such discountsas the United States Government might consider appropriate.Ambassador Henderson said he did not know whether this offer would beconsidered a satisfactory basis for United States action, but that he would transmitit to Washington. Musaddiq reiterated his belief that the British Governmentwould reject it. Instead of prompt acceptance, there would be protracted negotia-tions and premature publicity which would make his position difficult. He saidtime was of the essence; he could not hold this offer open indefinitely.Despite Musaddiq&apos;s continued suspicious attitude, the Department considersthis offer encouraging. It gets over principle difficulty which has been blockingan agreement on arbitration, namely, the question of taking future profits intoconsideration. It also seems to show that Musaddiq has dropped his insistence on advanced payment of  49 millions claimed to be due Iran. (Information thatthe Department has from private sources tends to confirm this.) The Departmenttherefore hopes that the British Government will give Musaddiq&apos;s offer immediatefavourable consideration.There are, of course, certain gaps and possible difficulties which occur to theState Department, including:  1. Musaddiq might change his mind. We believe this danger can be reducedby a prompt reply;2. While Musaddiq did not definitely agree to negotiate a Phase Two Com-mercial Agreement with A.I.O.C. or other companies after signing of an arbitrationagreement, he did not comment negatively. We are authorising Henderson&apos; in his discretion to attempt to clarify this point;3. According to Henderson, Musaddiq envisages that arbitration shall be between the Iranian Government and A.I.O.C., not the British Government. Aswe interpret it, the statute of the International Court does not permit a private
company to be a party to a case before it. Therefore, it would not be legallypossible to meet M.usaddiq&apos;s exact terms. This difficulty might be met by variousmeans which we would wish to explore with the British and Iranians. It might alsobe useful to consult the Court itself informally. Two alternatives which occur tous are:  (a) The arbitral agreement between the Iranian Government and the BritishGovernment would make the British Government nominally a partyto the case but would make clear by its text that A.I.O.C. was the realparty at interest;(b) The arbitral agreement between the Iranian Government and A.I.O.C.would provide that the Court should appoint a panel of three, five orother mutually agreeable number of arbiters.4. Musaddiq insists upon an advance of $100 millions from the United StatesGovernment promptly after agreement on arbitration and would be, we are sure,unwilling to have the advance contingent on, or await, conclusion of a long-termcommercial sales agreement. We are confident that we can make money availablepromptly, although we may find it desirable to make payments in instalments. Webelieve the price and other terms can be so arranged as to avoid embarrassment to commercial negotiations. In any case, we are convinced a commitment thatthere will be a prompt advance of some substantial amount of money is essential&quot; bait &quot; to get Musaddiq&apos;s agreement to arbitration and that undue delay after thedate of signing of the arbitral agreement would cause the whole opportunity tobe lost. ,The Department strongly hopes that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will find it possible to consider urgently the following two points: First, the form of arbitra-tion which would be satisfactory to them and would meet the difficulty indicatedin paragraph 3 above; and Second, preparation for the early negotiation of acommercial agreement for the purchase of Iranian oil.Meanwhile, the Department considers it most desirable that it be able to convey immediately to Musaddiq British acceptance in principle of his offer andwillingness promptly to begin consideration of the details. The Department isauthorising Henderson to say that the offer is being transmitted to the British andalso being carefully studied here.The Department emphasises the importance which it attaches to the UnitedStates and United Kingdom taking advantage of this apparent change in Musaddiq&apos;attitude with the minimum of delays and in absolute secrecy.30th December, 1.952.
