Section 3 of the Act of Union (6 Anne Cap. 11) (which incorporatedthe Act of Anne v 6, Cap. 8) provides that every Sovereign after Queen Anne at&quot;his or her coronation. .. take and subscribe an oath tomaintain and preserve inviolably the said settlement of theChurch of England and the doctrine worship discipline and government thereof as by law established within the kingdomsof England and Ireland the dominion of Wales and town of Berwick upon Tweed and the territories thereuntobelonging!1.
JLtv4. Slight changes were subsequently made in the wording of theOith on the Union with Ireland in 1800 and again on the dis-establishmentof the Irish Church in 1870 when the &quot;united church of England and Ireland&quot;disappeared.5. In 1936 consideration was given, in the light of constitutional developments within the Commonwealth, to the question whether the further changes which would be necessary required legislation.The Law Officers advised that since the form of the Oath is laiddown by statute it cannot be altered without statutory authority;  but ithad always been recognised that, &quot;if a statute is passed altering theconstitutional position of this country in such a way as to render the words of the original Oath no longer applicable, that Act may be treated asimpliedly authorising, and indeed requiring, a corresponding alteration in the wording of the Oath&quot;.   The Statute of Westminster had altered theconstitutional position of the United Kingdom in relation to the Dominions insuch a way as to render the then existing words of the Coronation Oathinapplicable.   It followed that an alteration should be made as to giveeffect to the alteration made by the Statute of Westminster which Statutemight properly be treated as authority for making such an alteration.   the revision must, they said, be limited to what was essential to give effectto the alteration in the constitutional position.6. In the result, after protracted correspondence with the Dominions,the form of Oath was altered in 1937 to read:-&quot;Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the peoples of Great Britain, Ireland, Canada, Australia, New zealand and the Union of South Africa, of your Possessions and theother  Territories to any of them belonging or pertaining, andof your Empire of India, according to their respective laws and customs ?Will you to your power cause Law and Justice, in Mercy,to be executed in all your judgements?Will you to the utmost of your power maintain the Laws of Godard the true profession of the Gospel?Will you to the utmost of your power maintain in the UnitedKingdom the Protestant Reformed Religion established by law?And will you maintain and preserve inviolably the settlementof the Church of England, and the doctrine, worship, discipline,and government thereof, as by law established in England?And will you preserve unto the Bishops and Clergy of England,and to the Churches there committed to their charge, all such rights, and privileges, as by law do or shall appertain to them,or any of them? &quot;On the point of law we do not dissent from this Opinion.7. Since 1937 India and the Irish Republic have left the commonwealth and Pakistan and Ceylon have become self-governing members of theCommonwealth.   Further alterations are therefore needed in the first part of the Oath and, for the reasons given by the Law Officers in 1936/7,we think that they can be made without legislation.Part I of the Oath, revised accordingly to give effect to theminimum alterations required by the constitutional developments and changes
in the Commonwealth since 1937, would read as follows&quot;Will you solemnly promise and swear to govern the peoples of the United Kingdom and Great Britain andNorthern Ireland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, theUnion of South Africa, Pakistan and Ceylon, of yourpossessions and the other territories to any of thembelonging or pertaining, according to their respective laws and customs ? &quot;SimondsD.M.F.4th February, 1953.
