He spoke in the warmest terms of the kindness arid hospitality that hadbeen shown to him. The visit to Hatfield had clearly been a great success a1i&apos;dhe spoke most warmly of the freedom and intimacy of the talks he had withthe Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Salisbury andLord Swinton.3. The principal and most difficult point in these discussions had been thefuture relationship of Pakistan to the Commonwealth. He had had to explain that,as a result of the discussions that had taken place in Cabinet before he went toLondon, Pakistan had decided on an elected Head of State. The attitude of UnitedKingdom Ministers had been made very clear to him but he had explained to all of them, including Mr. Churchill, that the decisive factor was the decision to allowIndia to remain in the Commonwealth as a Republic. Once that decision hadbeen taken it was no longer possible for Pakistan to accept a different status, andpolitical pressure here would put it out of the question that she should do so. lord salisbury had indicated his regret at the Indian decision, Mr. Churchill equallyhad said that it was not his decision, but the fact remained that Mr. churchill had supported that decision in the House, and that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom were completely committed to it.   He had made the43472
further point (I gathered with Mr. Churchill) when he had been warned that ifPakistan became a Republic Her Majesty&apos;s Government might have to wash their hands of active support for her, that the fact that India had taken this step hadnot resulted in the slightest difference in the support, or at any rate in the interesttaken in India and her affairs by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom.Despite the fact that Pakistan had remained a full Commonwealth member, that had not been the slightest advantage to her, so far as the United Kingdom Govern-ment were concerned, in connection with the discussions over Kashmir. Pakistanhad had no more help from Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomthan appeared to have been accorded to India.4. While, however, the decision was irrevocable, he had made it clear to united Kingdom Ministers that Pakistan, whatever the alteration in her Constitu-tional position, could be relied upon to remain in close and friendly association with the United Kingdom Government, and to give all the help in her power if a crisis arose.5. He realised quite well that the decision was unpalatable and all the more so because the affection and respect of the British people for their young Queenwas something that had to be seen at first hand to be believed. He fully realised that the change to Republican status was all the more to be regretted from our point of view in these circumstances, but he repeated that for reasons he had already given (and which he proceeded further to elaborate) Pakistan had no option.6. I said I could well understand the feeling of Ministers in the UnitedKingdom on this subject, and the feeling of public opinion. It was particularly unfortunate that any change should run so close to the Coronation. If, in fact,there was no way out of this for Pakistan, there did seem to me to be very great advantage in saying as little as possible about it at the present time, and waiting until after the Coronation. It was quite true that the Basic Principles Committeehad made provision for an elected Head of State, but I did not so far see anyparticular appreciation of the implications of their proposal. The Press had notfastened on to it as a reason for changing Pakistani status inside the Common-wealth, and their attention was concentrated on other controversial aspects of the basic Principles Committee&apos;s report. If in fact the point was not at this stage of:active interest here, surely there was everything to be said for delaying sayinganything about the attitude of the Government for as long as possible.7. Nazimuddin said that he appreciated this point and that he had made itclear in London that in fact no early action was likely to be necessary.The Basic Principles Committee&apos;s report would have to be debated, andafter it had been debated and decisions taken on it, the outcome of those decisions would have to go to a drafting Committee. He did not himself anticipate that it need be necessary to get down to the outcome of the work of the drafting committee until possibly September or October next year. That would takematters well beyond the Coronation. The Prime Minister did not, however,indicate, and I did not think it wise to press him on this, whether the Governmentwould feel bound to make their,, own decision more explicit during the spring of next year..
