Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953SECRET Copy No.     7.0C. (53) 3130th January, 1953CABINETSUPPLY expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer we came into office pledged to reduce expenditure. Events since October1951 have only made it abundantly clear that our whole economy depends on areduction in expenditure and a lightening of the burdens of taxation on industry.Unless industry is given the freedom and the resources to re-equip itself and tokeep in the van of progress, we cannot hope to support the standard of life andthe position in the world which we now enjoy.2. We made a start on incentives in last years Budget. These were mostlypersonal. Now we are faced with the slackening of production and the need forbroader incentives.3. In October last I sent a letter to all Ministers describing the alarmingbudgetary prospects for 1953-54, and calling for a close review of all expenditure,not excluding major questions of policy. I am grateful to my colleagues for the help they have given me in securing reductions in expenditure so far as is consistent with approved policies. But it is in the realm of food, partly owing to the removalof further subsidies in the process of decontrolling eggs, feeding-stuffs, &amp;c, that Ihave had the main response.^ 4. Although I am pressing on wherever possible both with the study and withthe implementing of administrative changes which contribute to economy, we must recognise that no really substantial savings remain to be achieved by administrativesavings alone. Changes in policy can bring administrative measures in their train,and a number of proposals are being worked out which will yield some worth-whilereductions. But reductions in expenditure of the order which we had in mind in our election pledges and which many of our supporters in the House of Commons want to see, can only be effected by big changes in policy.5. Changes in important Government policy, however necessary, cannot beeffected without much thought and preparation. As my colleagues are aware, con-sideration is being given to the possibility of making changes in a number of fields.For example, in the field of defence the Cabinet agreed that a radical review ofthe pattern of our defence effort in the years after 1953 should be put in hand.In the field of health, the Minister of Health and I as explained in C. (53) 30have it in mind to set up an enquiry into the cost of the service as a whole.In the housing field some lightening of the burden on the Exchequer should bea natural consequence of the new proposals on Housing Policy which the Ministerof Housing has put before the Cabinet (C. (53) 23, 24, 25 and 26).Expenditure on education in schools is going up rapidly owing to the heavyincrease in the birthrate immediately after the war. Next year&apos;s estimate at  259millions shows an increase of  16 millions over this year. In 1954-55, I expect afurther increase of  11- 12 millions. I attach importance to balancing our state-ment on a Health Enquiry by some indication that we have in mind steps designedto keep the Education Estimates under control. I am still discussing this problem with the Education Ministers.6.   We cannot hope that changes of policy in these fields can be made in timefor the results to be embodied in next year&apos;s budget. But as stated in paragraph 2,43623 b
the budget for 1953-54 must show that we are doing everything possible to effectreductions in expenditure. It is in this spirit that I invite my colleagues to considerthe following table, which sets out the comparison between supply expenditure in1952-53 and in 1953-54 on the basis of the Estimates as they stand at present.1952-53*       1953-54-.&quot; .  m.  m.Defence PreparationsDefence Budget...............      1,462 1,637Other Defence Items (Civil Defence, industrial capacity (defence), strategic reserves)  ...        172 147Total Defence Preparations        ...      1,634 1,784Social ServicesNational Health Service      .........        393 410Education      ...............        259 286Other Social Services (including housing,national insurance, national assistance,pensions)  ...      ......      ......        455 491Total Social Services       ...      ...      1,107 1,187Food Subsidies     ...............        277 200Other Services(Including   Exchequer   contributions    to national Insurance Funds, supply and trading services)......... 593 61bTotal Supply (other than Post Office self-balancing)       ...      ...      ......      3,611 3,789Increase      ............  178 millions7. Of this increase of  178 millions defence preparations account for  150millions and civil expenditure for  28 millions.8. Ministers will recall that the Defence Programme for 1953-4 was consideredby the Cabinet last autumn. It was then decided that the defence budget shouldbe restricted to  1,610 millions with whatever addition was necessitated by increased wages in the engineering industry. This addition was assessed at  26-75 millionsmaking the defence budget in round figures  1,637 millions.9 Civil expenditure shows an increase of  28 millions. This is after taking into account savings amounting to  50 millions from the removal of the subsidies on eggs, feeding-stuffs and flour used in confectionery; even the achievement of savings of this amount assumes that there will be a substantial measure of under-recoupment to farmers of their increased costs at the forthcoming Annual Review.But for these savings the increase in civil expenditure would have been  78 millions,i.e., almost exactly the increase of  80 millions on social services. These servicesincrease inexorably year by year. We cannot much longer offset this increase by reductions of food subsidies.10. My colleagues will agree that this is not good enough, and it is essentialthat civil supply expenditure should be lower than last year&apos;s figure. In the ensuingparagraphs I set out various further measures of economy which I recommend tobring this about.(A) National Health Service-Increase in Prescription Charge11. In agreement with the Minister of Health I propose a change in theform of the charge for Health Service prescriptions, which (on assumptions whichI think are reasonable) will save about  6 millions. (I understand that the Secretaryof State for Scotland, on the other hand, feels some doubt about the proposal.)* The 1952/53 figures are the original Estimate for the year as modified by the changesannounced in the Budget.

12. At present patients who are given prescriptions by their Health Servicedoctors are required to pay 15. Od. per prescription form, even if more than oneprescription is written on the form. The balance is paid by the Exchequer.Patients&apos; payments are estimated on the present basis to amount to over  7 millions for 1953-4 I propose that in future the charge will be Is. Od. per individualprescription, so that if two prescriptions are written on the same form the patientwill have to pay 2s. Od.13. The average cost per prescription at the present time is about 4s. 5d.so that the change will still mean that the patient is paying, on the average, lessthan one-quarter of the cost of each prescription. It is not unreasonable thesedays to expect a patient to pay Is. Od. for each prescription that he is given as the large number of patients who receive forms bearing a single prescription doalready. The change will, moreover, defeat a tendency which has begun tomanifest itself for doctors to write, several prescriptions on a single form in orderto reduce the charge to the patients. Since charges were introduced, the numberof prescriptions per form has risen in England and Wales from just over 1  to 1Jand in Scotland from .1 -4 to 1 -5. &quot;14. The change can be made without legislation, though amending regula-tions will be required; they will be subject to a negative resolution. Details of thechange have been worked out and they can be given effect speedily. To yield afull year&apos;s saving of  6 millions the change would have to become effective by the1st March; each month&apos;s delay would reduce the saving by i\ million.15. There are no exemptions from the prescription charges (it was. foundimpracticable to make them). But arrangements already exist, and would, ofcourse, continue (and slightly offset the expected saving) for full repayment to allpersons in receipt of National Assistance, or for whom the charge means hardship,and to all those whose prescriptions are supplied in connection with treatment fora war disability.(B) Food Subsidies16. In the table at paragraph 6 food subsidies are shown at a total of  200millions next year. As already explained, this figure takes account of the savingsresulting from decontrol of eggs, feeding-stuffs and cereals, which reduce the subsidytotal from the  250 millions level which I announced in my Budget. Even \o getdown to the  250 millions level, however, will require some cuts in other food subsidies since increases in the purchase prices which the Ministry of Food willhave to pay for certain commodities would, in default of such cuts, put the totalsubsidies level at somewhere between  265 millions and  270 millions. The subsidycuts which the Minister of Food proposes to achieve are the following:  Butter   millionsIncrease price by 4d. a lb.Subsidy saving...............      ...       9(I should myself prefer to increase the price by6d. a lb., thus saving some  14 million.)Margarine and cooking fatIncrease price by Id. a lb.Subsidy saving ...      ........^      .....&apos;.       5MilkAvoid the reduction of id. a pint which would naturallytake place in the flush months of April, May and june.Subsidy saving ...      ......      ;..      ...      ...       4Total saving   ...      ...      ...      18(23)This saving of  18 millions or, as I should prefer,  23 millions, will enable us to getthe subsidy total down first to the  250 millions level and then, with the decontroldecreases to  200 millions17.  I do not think, however, that with the budgetary prospect such as I have described we can be satisfied to leave the food subsidy total at as high a level as  200 millions.  I have discussed with the Minister of Food the directions in43623 &apos; &apos; B 2
which further reductions might be secured. The biggest elements in this total are,the Bread (baking) Subsidy and the Milk Subsidy which in 1953-54 will account for some  40 millions and  36 millions respectively, apart from the special welfaresubsidy of about  37 millions for mothers and children. These are vast amounts which, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, I find it difficult to disregard in my search for economies, but I recognise that they are awkward items to tackle from thepolitical point of view. The Minister also regards milk as of great nutritionalimportance and, on bread, he hopes that the exercise of consumer preference for white (unsubsidised) bread may be found to reduce the burden of the subsidy onthe national loaf. We have agreed, therefore, that if further savings on food subsidies are to be secured we should consider first the following two commodities:Sugar   millionsIncrease the price of domestic sugar by Id. lb.Saving  ...      ...      ...      .........     ...      ...     9MeatBy a rearrangement of price-schedules, involving increases in themore expensive qualities averaging over all meat \d. a lb.,achieve a saving on the subsidy of..........     ...     8(C) Strategic Reserves18. During the present financial year we have spent some  70 millions on strategic stockpile, 15 per cent, of it on food and the rest on industrial raw materials.The total value of our strategic stockpiles at the end of this financial year will beabout  200 millions, 35 per cent, in food and the rest in raw materials. I would not for one moment claim that this is a safe level for our strategic stocks. Precisely what our targets should be in the light of the recent reassessment of the dangers by theChiefs of Staff is now being worked out. But it will certainly be higher than thepresent stocks, including those we have in sight. I am very much afraid that it willbe higher than we shall ever be able to afford.19. The Minister of Materials, who has a major responsibility for stockpiling,has urged upon me the desirability of making a significant volume of purchasesduring the coming financial year. Reluctantly I have felt bound to ask on generaleconomy grounds that our expenditure this year should be considerably reduced below the level of last year. I propose, accordingly, that new purchases for thestockpile in the coming financial year shall be  32-7 millions, made up of 15-2 millions for food and  17-5 millions for industrial raw materials. There isvery little room in these amounts for manoeuvre, since a great part of the expenditure is committed. I feel it is the maximum we can afford and I have, therefore, notbeen able to find room to allow a start to be made with the civil oil stockpile. Inaddition, I am making a contingent provision of some  12 millions in order to buyfor the stockpile the trading stocks of one commodity which, if we are able to revert to private trade during the year, we shall probably be unable to dispose of.20. In the totals I have quoted in paragraph 6 provision for strategic reservesstands at  55 millions. My proposals for limiting new purchases would reducethis figure to approximately  46 millions.21.  To summarise, the possible savings I have indicated above are:-  millionsRevised prescription charge       .........      6Sugar subsidy        ...      ...      ...... 9Meat subsidy................      8Strategic raw materials     ............     932If these are all achieved, the position would be that next year&apos;s total Supply expendi-ture would be higher than this year&apos;s by  146 millions, while Supply expenditureother than on Defence preparations would be higher by  5 millions. This outcomewill, it is clear, be a disappointment to our Party, even when it is pointed out thatthe &quot;prospects of economy have been adversely affected by increased costs. It isplain, I suggest, that we must at least decide to achieve the savings I havesummarised in this paragraph.
22. The question remains whether these further reductions should be incor-porated in the Vote oh Account figures due to be published on 23rd February andin the subsequent Estimates, or should be reserved for announcement in the Budget.The publication of Estimates totals at a higher level than we ultimately intend mayexpose us to some unnecessary additional criticism between the Vote on Accountdate and the Budget, and there is also the fact that if the announcement and, there-fore, the effective date of the changes is delayed, the amount of the saving in thenext financial year will be reduced. Against this there is the consideration that further cuts in the food subsidies (additional to those arising from decontrol andfrom the need to keep the level at the previously announced total of  250 millions)may be more readily accepted against the background of the next Budget than ifthey are disclosed at an earlier stage In particular I have more chance in a budget of setting the rough against the smooth. I should welcome the views of mycolleagues on the merits of these alternatives. The Minister of Food will state his reasons for preferring to reduce the sugar and meat subsidies at the time of theBudget.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. I,29th January, 1953.
