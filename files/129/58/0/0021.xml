Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953SECRETC. (S3) 2121st January, 1953CABINETEAST-WEST  TRADEFINANCIAL AND TRANS-SHIPMENT controls memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsProblemThere is a serious gap in the system of security export controls, maintained bythe Western countries associated in the Paris Group, on the supply of strategic materials to the Soviet bloc and to China. This arises because in the continental countries belonging to the Paris Group, it is possible for strategic goods consigned to an innocent destination to be diverted by trans-shipment in continental ports toone of the Iron Curtain countries. Indeed, British merchants are engaged in manysuch transactions, which to a substantial extent are conducted in sterling. We have always believed that the only effective method of stopping this traffic is the intro-duction of physical trans-shipment controls and we introduced them unilaterallyas far as United Kingdom ports are concerned in November 195.1. The UnitedStates, Canada and Denmark also already have such a control and all the remainingmembers of the Paris Group except the Netherlands agree that some form of trans-shipment controls on highly strategic goods is necessary. But they are not willingto introduce them unless all the other countries, including the Netherlands, do soat the same time. The Netherlands Government have stated categorically that theywill consider the adoption of trans-shipment controls only if all the other member governments will agree to apply the financial controls necessary to prevent resi-dents in their countries from participating in merchanting transactions in strategic goods for the Iron Curtain countries which do not come physically into their territories.Recommendation2. I recommend that we should agree to introduce a measure of financial con-trol over dealings by United Kingdom residents in strategic goods which are never inthe United Kingdom but that we should only do so subject to the condition that allthe other member countries of the Paris Group would agree simultaneously tointroduce trans-shipment controls.Background3. In the discussions which have been taking place in the Paris Group overmore than the past year, we have resisted the introduction of financial controls (a) because they are open to evasion and we did not consider they would be effective;(b) because of the complication of the sterling area structure and the inter-national use of our currency.We have previously had the support of the United States and Canadian representa-tives. The United States Government have now, however, told us that they intend to make a concession to the Dutch by introducing a sweeping measure of &quot;trans-action &quot; controls over the activities of their nationals to prevent them facilitating thesupply of strategic materials to the Soviet bloc or China.43569 pCopy No.70
4. I recognise that the introduction of financial controls of any sort at a timewhen we are moving towards completer freedom in the use of sterling is highlydistasteful.   But in my view the time has come when we must either (a) accept the continued existence of a serious gap in our controls, for whichstate of affairs we cannot escape a share in the responsibility;(b) take a step which, though open to objections, would make a real con-tribution to security.If we choose course (a), I fear that the effect on the future of the whole control system will be most serious. As the supply position throughout the world becomesless difficult, it will become progressively easier for the Soviet bloc and China to exploit gaps in our controls. If we do not try to stop them, the whole system will tend to become ineffective. This would not be in our interests, either from thepoint of view of security or of our relations with the United States. We have sofar successfully resisted the attempts of the United States Government to drag orforce us into more extreme forms of control which would have amounted to fulleconomic warfare; but we shall only be able to maintain this position so long aswe show that the Paris Group is genuinely doing its best to deny or restrict thesupply to the Soviet bloc and to China of goods on lists which are confined togenuine strategic items, thereby leaving the way open for trade in the rest of thefield.5. I attach as an Annex a&apos;paper prepared by an interdepartmental group of officials setting out the advantages and disadvantages of the introduction of financial controls. I believe that we should gain more from the point of view of security,and our relations with our Allies by imposing these controls, on the clear under-standing that the other members of the Paris Group would simultaneously imposetrans-shipment controls, than we should lose on commercial and financial grounds.The present situation whereby the scrupulous refrain from undertaking deals instrategic commodities for the Soviet bloc and China only to see the unscrupuloustake the business is clearly unsatisfactory.6. My colleagues will observe that I have spoken throughout in terms of theimposition of financial controls whereas the Annexed paper refers also to trans-action controls. These have, however, the disadvantage of smacking of economic warfare and would, moreover, require legislation. In the circumstances, therefore,I would not ask my colleagues to consider their imposition.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,21st January, 1953.ANNEXNature of the Problem1. The United States, the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth (in part) and colonies, most Western European countries and Japan pursue a common policyof restricting or prohibiting the export to countries of the Soviet bloc and Chinaof &quot;strategic materials&quot; defined in agreed common lists. Furthermore, a numberof countries outside the Paris Group, under pressure or persuasion from the major powers, act cautiously about shipping strategic materials, which they may producce,direct to the Soviet bloc. There is. however, an important loophole in this world-wide system of control. Goods may leave a country nominally for one of the participating countries or some other innocent destination, and while en route,usually while lying in the free zone of one of the &quot; free ports,&quot; be resold to abuyer from the Soviet bloc, picked up by one of their ships and taken behind the Iron Curtain. Some of this business is-known to be handled by merchantsresident in London and operating in sterling. The merchants buy the goods abroad and resell them to third parties, without the goods ever entering the UnitedKingdom.
2. The United Kingdom considers that the most effective and the onlysatisfactory way of stopping these transactions is by the operation of &quot; trans-shipment controls.&quot; We ourselves already operate such controls, in our ownports, but some of the Continental countries concerned are reluctant to imposecontrols on goods which are trans-shipped in their ports but are not actuallyimported and therefore do not become subject to their security export controls.It is claimed, moreover, that in some cases the status of free port areas means that special and highly controversial legislation would be entailed. Furthermore, alltne other countries of the Paris Group (with the possible exception of Canada)consider that each country should exercise some form of control over transactionscarried out by its own residents which result in the sale of strategic goods to theSoviet bloc, even when the goods concerned never pass through or touch at thatcountry. Such controls have been variously described as &quot; financial&quot; or&quot; transaction &quot; controls and may be operated in various ways. All the european countries profess themselves ready to operate some such controls, though we haveno detailed information about their methods, or their effectiveness. The UnitedStates, which has no exchange control, has indicated its willingness to introduce a transaction control in the form of a regulation making it an offence for anyresident of the United States to take part in any deal involving the sale of strategic goods, wherever situated, to the Soviet bloc.Present Situation in Paris3. The Co-ordinating Committee is to meet in Paris early in February todiscuss these linked problems of trans-shipment and financial controls. all departments are agreed that the United Kingdom representatives should continueto urge at this meeting that the only effective solution to the problem lies in theintroduction of effective trans-shipment controls. The Foreign Office have,however, pointed out that the United Kingdom&apos;s position is weakened by herisolation on the related question of alternative controls, and feel that there is no prospect of any satisfactory results from these discussions unless the United King-dom representatives are able to offer some type of &quot; financial&quot; or &quot;transaction&quot;control in return for co-operation by Continental countries in adopting an effective system of trans-shipment control in their ports. Officials have therefore examinedwhat types of control it would be technically possible for the United Kingdom tointroduce and their consequences. Two distinct possibilities have been studied a &quot; financial &quot; control resting on the Exchange Control Act, and a &quot; transaction &quot;control which would require legislation of the nature of &quot; Trading with the Enemy *&apos;legislation.Financial Controls4. It is agreed that it is technically possible to introduce under the exchange control Act a scheme by which the Bank of England and authorised dealers acting on its behalf could reject applications made to the Exchange Control by UnitedKingdom residents for foreign exchange required for the purpose of financing thepurchase of certain listed commodities in countries outside the Paris Group forre-sale to a Soviet bloc country or China. These transactions often involve theopening of a sterling credit in favour of a non-resident, but the control would haveto apply whether or not sterling was used. The control must take the form of restricting the original purchase of the goods; it could not apply to their re-sale.It would stop the typical merchanting transaction in its present form about whichcomplaints are received from Continental countries. In fact, however, there are many possible methods of evasion. These are set out in detail in the appendix,but one important limitation of the control is that it would not restrict the activitiesof merchants operating in or through other sterling area countries, including theCommonwealth. It is doubtful whether the other Commonwealth countries wouldtake supporting action.5. In addition to these particular objections which concern the effectiveness of the scheme of &quot;financial control,&quot; the Bank of England point out that therewould be considerable practical difficulties in the administration of such control which would probably in part have to be delegated to the authorised dealers(i.e., the commercial banks) who would be most reluctant to assume this additionalresponsibility. Furthermore the Treasury and the Bank of England consider thatthere are strong objections of principle to this control, first because it involvesemploying the Exchange Control Act for a purpose for which it was never intendedand which has nothing to do with the balance of payments; secondly because it is43569 b 2
\most undesirable to introduce additional restrictive provisions into the exchange control at a time when the general policy of the Government it to make exchangeas freely transferable as possible; thirdly, because such restrictions are bound to affect to some extent (though the extent may be small and incalculable) the value and stability of sterling as a world-wide currency; fourthly, because it may possiblyaffect the existing commodity market arrangements and also the re-opening offurther markets in London in strategic commodities.6. This system of financial control would not require fresh legislation, but itwould necessitate an announcement of changes in exchange control administrationinvolving open discrimination against the Soviet bloc and China. This announce-ment which would have to go to all authorised dealers would immediately becomewidely known in mercantile circles. There is no possibility of introducing such control without publicity. While the restrictions themselves would be no more severe than the existing security export and trans-shipment controls, the use of theExchange Control Act would represent a new departure.Transaction Control7. This type of control which is similar to that proposed in the United States,would be introduced by passing legislation making it an offence for a resident inthe United Kingdom to engage in transactions involving the sale of strategic goodsdirectly or indirectly to countries of the Soviet bloc or China.8. The advantages of this type of legislation as a matter of enforcement wouldbe that it would shift the onus of proof. Under this system approval by the Bankof England, although perfectly in order, would not relieve the applicant of theliability of prosecution if the transaction involved an irregular sale of strategic goods. Under financial controls, using the Exchange Control Act, the banks wouldbe required to discover beforehand whether or not any particular transaction wasin strategic goods. If they gave their permission, having been misled as to thenature of the goods, the transaction would be legal unless it was possible to prove,which might be very difficult, that there had been deliberate mis-description andnot merely under-description.9. The main practical disadvantage of transaction control is the need for united Kingdom legislation, which would mean delay. The Foreign Office consider,however, that this would not destroy its value as a bargaining counter in theforthcoming talks in the Paris Group, since if our representatives could make a firm offer of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ willingness to legislate, substantial progress in preparing trans-shipment controls on the continent might well bepossible during the period when legislation was being prepared here. A more serious objection to this type of control is its severity. The public would associateit with powers used in war-time under the Trading with the Enemy Act and it mighthave to be openly discriminatory against the Soviet) bloc and China. Theeffect would be that certain transactions were in themselves illegal, anda United Kingdom resident entering on a transaction which led indirectlyto the sale of strategic goods to the Soviet bloc or China would ipso facto be guilty of an offence. It might well be argued that such a measure would be appropriateonly under conditions of economic warfare, a policy which we have so fardeliberately avoided, although in the case of China the United Nations resolution of 18th May, 1951, calling for a selective embargo, could be held to provide cover.Summary10. There is at present a loophole in the Paris Group security export control system due to the trans-shipment of strategic goods through Western Europeanports. We have denied the use of United Kingdom ports for this purpose since november 1951, but certain Western European countries have so far refused tofollow. They assert that financial controls would solve the problem more effectively and the Dutch, in particular, refuse to introduce trans-shipment controlsunless the United Kingdom first prevents its merchants from initiating these transactions.The objections to the adoption of either financial or transaction controls are set out in this paper. We are satisfied that such measures, alone, would not solve the problem.The point for decision, therefore, is whether or not the United Kingdom should offer in Paris to introduce such controls in an attempt to secure multilateral agree-ment on a system of trans-shipment controls.
Conclusion11. Since officials have been unable to reach agreement we find it necessaryto seek a Ministerial decision on the following points:  (1) Should the United Kingdom Delegation in Paris be authorised to announce the willingness of the United Kingdom to adopt some form of controlover dealings by its residents in strategic goods which are never in theUnited Kingdom; subject to the condition that other countries would agree to establish trans-shipment controls?(2) If (1) is accepted should the general pattern of control offered be thatdescribed in paragraphs 4 to 6 above (&quot; financial controls &quot;) or thatdescribed in paragraphs 7-9 (&quot; transaction control &quot;)?AppendixLIMITATIONS OF PROPOSED SCHEME OF FINANCIAL controls the scheme would have the following shortcomings (some of which must applyto other schemes);(i) The list of commodities controlled would have to be very short, since itcould include only those which could be described in completelyunequivocal terms; otherwise there would be scope for describing ship-ments in a misleading manner, so as to make them appear to be withoutstrategic importance. A number of strategic commodities, such as ballbearings, would be extremely difficult to deal with, because only certainvarieties are embargoed. This means that the list would probably haveto be confined to a few raw materials.(ii) If a United Kingdom dealer were deliberately to mis-describe the goods which he wished to re-sell, this would only come to light subsequently,if at all, and probably in circumstances which would make it difficultor impossible to produce evidence which could be used against the offender.(iii) The scheme would encourage direct transactions between non-participating countries and the Soviet bloc. Such direct, sales can easily be settled in sterling, since several Soviet bloc countries are in the transferableaccount area, and so are some countries which are providers of impor-tant raw materials, such as Chile. This would result in a loss of invisibleearnings, which might not be limited to the particular transactions.(iv) If the United Kingdom dealer were to sell goods to a third countryin the transferable account area, that country could resell the goods toa Soviet bloc country in the area without the transaction becomingknown at the time to the Bank of England; the Bank could do no more than check subsequently whether the goods had in fact been paid for from the country named.. Even where this was established the &quot; buyer &quot;in the &quot; neutral&quot; country may have been no more than a name, whohas immediately been reimbursed by sterling from a Russian account.To try to apply end-use checks in such cases would introduce delayswhich would be unacceptable. The Bank of England normally clearsapplications for exchange facilities within two hours, and any kind ofend-use check would require reference to the Export Licencing Branch(and possibly other Departments) whose investigations might take a fortnight or more; in any case it is doubtful whether we could applyeffective checks to goods which would not enter this country and mightbe on the high seas at the time.This means that we cannot accept the thesis put forward by theDutch in Paris that each country should concern itself only with thepolicing of transactions carried out by its own residents in its owncurrency. In our view if there is any question of financial controls a country must be responsible for controlling the financial transactionsof its own residents in any currency. In other words, if a United King-dom merchant obtains leave to sell strategic goods for sterling to anotherparticipating country within the transferable account area, it must befor that country to prevent re-sale of the goods to the bloc, even thoughthe further transaction is in sterling.
(v) We could exercise no control over purchases from a resident of the sterling area (except possibly in the dependent territories) of goods lying in,e.g., Rotterdam free port, with a view to resale to the Soviet bloc;and, as explained above, the resale in itself is not subject to control.These are domestic transactions which do not require reference to theBank.(vi) The United Kingdom Exchange control could not prevent a merchantwho resides in an independent sterling area country from using sterlingto buy goods for sale to the Soviet bloc nor prevent a United Kingdomresident from using such a merchant as his agent. The willingness ofother Commonwealth Governments to act.is doubtful; nor would thescheme touch transactions in sterling carried out by people who resideabroad but operate on a sterling account held in this country, whichmight quite well be unknown to their own exchange control authorities.(vii) Although it may be possible to apply the scheme to other dependent territories, it could not be worked by Hong Kong; it would not bepossible to prevent sales to China from being financed in Hong Kongdollars.
