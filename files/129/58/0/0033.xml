secret. (53) 3330th JANUARY, 1953.y. RENT AND REPAIRSMemorandum by the,Secretary of State for Scotland.      .I am in complete agreement with the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment about the need for finding an early solution of the rent restrictionproblem.   Discussions which I have had with him have shown, however, that conditions in Scotland are so different from those in England and Wales that aseparate Scottish solution, to be embodied in separate legislation, is required.2. Rent control has operated in Scotland on much the same lines as inEngland and V/ales.   In Scotland, however, there are no great variationsbetween &quot;old controlled&quot; rents (i. e. those continuously controlled since 1914)and &quot;new controlled&quot; rents (i. e. those which first came under control or were re-controlled in 1939); and lam satisfied that the fairest way of enablingScottish landlords to put their houses into repair and keep them in repair is toincrease all rents by a flat rate percentage.3. The Scottish system of valuation and rating differs in its essential features from that in England and Wales.   In Scotland, it is the rent actually paid which determines the gross annual value, unless that rent can be shown notto be a bona fide one.   Rates on houses are paid on the gross annual value, andthere are no deductions for repairs or other costs of management.   Rates are payable not only by occupiers, but also by owners, and the owner&apos;s share of any increase in the rate poundage has to be met out of rent.4. Scottish landlords have been faced not only with a very substantialrise in the. cost of repairs, but also with a large and progressive rise in theamount of owners1 rates.   They have therefore been at a serious disadvantageas compared with English landlords, and have experienced even greater difficulty in maintaining their houses in repair.   To arrest any further deterioration of Scottish house property, it will be necessary to increase rentsto reflect the higher cost of repairs and to take steps to ensure that this increase is not whittled away by further increases in the amount of owners&apos; rates.5. It is possible to ascertain with a fair degree of accuracy theproportion of the gross rent of controlled houses which Scottish landlords werespending, or ought to have been spending, on repairs in 1939.   The figure is roughly 21 per cent.  A committee which i set up recently to investigate andreport on the increase in the cost of repairs of house property since 1939 has nowadvised that the cost of repairs of housre property generally has risen by174 per cent since that date: and that as it is more costly to repair old houses(which form the bulk of controlled houses) there may well be a case for taking200 per cent as the increase.   If the latter figure is accepted, landlords who werespending 21 per cent of the gross rent on repairs in 1939 would have tocopy no.      cabinet
spend 63 per cent to carry out the same amount of work today - an increaseof 42 per cent of the gross rent.   On these figures there is a strong case for increasing the rents of all controlled houses in Scotland by about 40 per cent.For a typical Glasgow two-roomed house this would mean an increase of rent of less than 2/6d. a week.   I propose, however, to have further discussions withthe Minister of Housing and Local Government to see how far ah increase of this order would compare with the increases of rent which he is proposing for england and Wales.   It is clear that the increases for the two countries should be broadly comparable..6. Since the present level of controlled rents has proved insufficient toenable landlords to keep their houses in repair, and since the whole object ofincreasing rents is to encourage landlords to put their houses into good repair and thereafter maintain them in repair, there are very strong arguments forgiving landlords an immediate increase of rent.   It would, of course, benecessary to provide that, if after a reasonable period any landlord had failedto carry out the repairs necessary to put the house in good tenantable condition,the tenant should be able to withhold the increase of rent, in addition to any sums .which he may already be entitled to withhold under the Rent Restriction Acts.The Minister of Housing, however, proposes that any increase of rent shouldnot be automatic and that it should be payable only where the landlord depositswith the local authority a certificate to the effect that he has put the house in good tenantable repair.   If the tenant maintains that the house is not in goodrepair and the local authority support this view no increase of rent would be payable.   I propose to discuss this matter further with the Minister of Housingto see whether a solution acceptable to us both can be found.   I feel even greater difficulty about the Minister of Housing&apos;s additional proposal that landlordsshould be required, as a condition of their getting an increase in rent, to certifythat their average expenditure on repairs over a specified period was equivalentto the amount of the increase.   I do not see how we could justify the refusal of anincrease to a landlord who has kept his house in repair just because he has notspent an arbitrary sum over an arbitrary period in doing so.7. Any increase of rent would, under the present Scottish rating system,attract both owners1 and occupiers&apos; rates.   It is, however, essential to avoid this result.   Otherwise the increase of rent would be reduced by the amount of owners * rates and would be quite insufficient to enable landlords to keep their houses in repair, and Scottish tenants (unlike those in England and Wales) wouldincur a substantially increased liability for rates in addition to their increasedliability for rent.   I propose therefore that the increase of rent, which would berepresented as an additional payment by the tenant towards the cost ofrepairing and maintaining the house, should not be taken into account in fixing the rateable value of a controlled house, and should not therefore attract eitherowners&apos; or occupiers1 rates.8. In addition, and to prevent any diminution in the sum available tothe landlord for repairs, as a result of increases in rate poundage, I propose thatowners1 rates for all rent-controlled houses should be stabilised at their present level.9. Action on these lines would, I think, meet the immediate difficultiesof Scottish landlords.   But a long-term solution must be found if thedifficulties inherent in the Scottish rating system, under which any increaseof rent attracts owners1 rates, are to be overcome.   I propose therefore toappoint a committee to examine the Scottish rating problem in all its aspects, including the practicability of abolishing owners&apos; rates.10. I strongly support the proposals of the Minister of Housing and Local
J.S.Scottish Office, S.W.1.30th January, 1953.Government in C. (53) 24 for dealing with houses which landlords do not put into a proper state.of repair, with the aid of increased rents, or which otherwise fall into disrepair.   Some owners will prefer to restcontent with the existing rent and to carry out the minimum repairs.We must therefore make arrangements to ensure that if a house which is capable of being put into good repair is not repaired by the landlord withina reasonable period, the local authority may themselves carry out repairs and charge the cost to the landlord.   Other houses which are beyondrepair should be transferred to the local authority or some other publicbody who would do what they could to make them reasonably habitableuntil arrangements could be made for their demolition.   In my view it is .most important that we should produce a constructive scheme for deaEngwith those houses which would be demolished now if we had sufficientnew houses to replace them.  Such a scheme.would be our main defence against any charge that we are preserving the income of landlords fromslum property.   The exact form of the scheme: whether the house shouldbe taken over by the local authorities or by some other agency: and what assistance it may be necessary to provide for the purpose, are matters which will require further consideration.11.      If proposals on these lines are acceptable I should like authorityto get ahead with the drafting of the necessary Scottish Legislation.   Thematters which I have still to discuss with the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment could be isft open for decision at a later date.
