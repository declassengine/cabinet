HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY.^ GOVERNMENT)secret.(53) 18 COPY NO.14th JANUARY, 1953.CABINETPERSIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.The position reached as a result of the meeting between ministers and the Americans on 13th January is as follows.1.   Terms of ReferenceSince the Cabinet approved the terms attached to my memorandum C. (53) 3,the Americans have continually pressed us to be content with some more generalformula.      Mr. Henderson has urged that while Dr. Musaddiq is prepared toallow arbitration to be based on any United Kingdom nationalisation law theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) may care to select, and w-iile he is fully aware that in the case of the coal-owners in this country the tribunal set up to assess compensation under the Act took future profits into account, he cannot inany circumstances accept terms of reference which would make this factpublicly clear.   We cannot, of course, be certain that an arbitral tribunalwill award the Company compensation for loss of profits under the Concessionand. the Persians will no doubt ask it not to do so.   But while this is a riskwhich We must accept, it would be quite unacceptable that we should voluntarilyagree to terms of reference under which there was a risk of the tribunal rulingthat its terms of reference did not allow it even to entertain the Company&apos;s claim.After a great deal of argument involving consultation with the Company1 s leadingcounsel, agreement was reached on the formula at Annex A, which is acceptedby all concerned.2.     Form of ArbitrationWe have agreed that Mr. Henderson shall propose to Dr, Musaddiq that we ask the International Court to decide between three alternatives:The court to constitute itself as an ad hoc arbitral tribunal, includingthe same judges (and not less) as sat in June 1952 to hear thepreliminary issue of jurisdiction.(ii) The United Kingdom judge and the Persian ad hoc judge to selectthree  other members of the Court and so constitute an arbitral tribunal.(iii) The Vice-President of the Court (since the President is the UnitedKingdom judge) to appoint a panel of five arbitrators from outsidethe Court.   (See text of Arbitral Agreement at Annex B),We are not completely satisfied that it is proper to urge the international court to adopt alternatives (i) or (ii), since they amount almost to a means ofcircumventing Article 34, paragraph (i) of its statutes which lays down that the(i)
( o2/Court can only entertain cases of which States are parties.   But in deference tothe urgent wish expressed by the Americans we are content to put all the alternatives to the Court and have been at pains to avoid any bias in ourpresentation.   Apart from the difficulty connected with the Court*s statuteswe are not altogether happy about the reliability of the tribunal which would emerge if alternatives (i) or (ii) were adopted, but we cannot at this stage put ourselves in the position of seeming to question the fairness of the Court when we have repeatedly urged in public that the dispute should be referred to it.The Americans demurred at our suggestion that theArbitral agreement should be signed by a representative of Her Majesty1 s Government.   They quotedMr. Henderson&apos;s record of his conversation on 31st December, 1952 whenDr. Musaddiq said that he &quot;would prefer that the Arbitral Agreement be signed by the A.I.O.C. bui wouldnot seriously object if the British Government would sign the Agreement in the capacity of representative of A.I.O.C.&quot;  We said that having made it quite clear in the text that the arbitration was to be between the PersianGovernment and the A.I.O.C., we could not go further and agree that the ArbitralAgreement itself should be signed by the A.I.O.C.  We might with reluctance agreeto its being signed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on behalf of the A.I.O.C., butwe saw no reason why Dr. Musaddiq should not be asked to sign it with her Majesty&apos;s Government tout court.   The Americans agreed, with reluctance,to try this on Dr. Musaddiq.3,     &quot;Tie in&quot; between United States advance payments and commercial negotiations.The new form of the Defence Materials Procurement Agency Agreement(Annex C) enshrines, at paragraph 2, the proposed commitment from Dr. Musaddiqto enter into negotiations with an international organisation including the A.I.G.C.This commitment thus acquires the status of a contractual obligation betweenPersia and the United States and the Americans can justifiably withhold paymentof the instalments if Dr. Musaddiq falls down on his undertaking.   This is very satisfactory.In return for this we have agreed that the first instalment, which will bepaid over when the Arbitration Agreement enters into force shall be $50 millions and not $40 millions.4.   Embargo and immunity of vessels.The Americans agreed reluctantly to ask Dr. Musaddiq to exchange letterswith us under which(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government would declare the embargo lifted;(b) The Persian Government would undertake not to seize any tugs,dredgers, tankers, etc. belonging to the A.I.O.C. which may have toenter Persian waters before or after the conclusion of the commercialcontract.It is, of course, superfluous formally to raise the embargo, but our note wouldprovide a convenient way of eliciting the undertaking which we want from the persians (see text at Annex D).5.   Overall AgreementWe had thought that the Arbitral Agreement, the Defence MaterialsProcurement Agency Agreement and the Exchange of Letters might appropriately
be &quot;crowned&quot; by a Protocol signed by the Governments of the United Kingdom,Persia and the United States.   This would serve two purposes:   first, it woulddemonstrate in the clearest possible manner that we had all buried the hatchet;second, it would make quite sure that the three documents formed an integralwhole and came into effect simultaneously.   The Americans, however, took strongexception to being involved in any tripartite agreement.   They also pointed out,as is true, that the terms of the three documents make it clear that they hangtogether and that their effect is simultaneous.   We therefore agreed not to pressour point.On the other hand the Americans asked us to agree that there should be amemorandum which Mr. Henderson would hand to Dr. Musaddiq with the drafts of the Arbitral Agreement, the Defence Mater-ials Procurement Agency agreement and the Exchange of Letters.   Their idea, which they only developed fully afterthe meeting with Ministers, would be that this memorandum and the accompanyingdrafts should be initialled in Teheran by Dr. Musaddiq and Mr. Henderson, andalso in London by representatives of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the UnitedStatej? Government (presumably Mr. Byroade himself).   We would authorisethe United States Ambassador here forthwith to inform Dr. Musaddiq through mr.. Henderson that if and when the initialling in Teheran had taken placewe would be happy to initial a similar document in London.  Once we were satisfied that the initialling in Teheran had taken place, we would despatch our representatives to sign the final texts there.   We agreed (see text at Annex E).A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.14th January, 1953.
