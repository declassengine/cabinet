Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953SECRETC. (53) 4131st January, 1953CABINETPERSIANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the annexed report receivedfrom the U.S. Embassy in London of a meeting between the U.S. Ambassador atTehran and Dr. Musaddiq on 28th January.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,31st January, 1953.This evening Mosaddiq asked if I could come see him. I went immediatelyaccompanied by Saieh, my Iranian assistant. Our conversation lasted approxi-mately 2J hours. I told him I had not visited him for several days because I hadbeen waiting fresh instructions from Washington. In view change of administra-tion entire United States position was being reviewed in light of our variousconversations.2. Mosaddiq said he had assumed that change of administration might causerecess in our conversations. In our last talk I had told him that I thought it wouldbe difficult for Court to adjudicate question of Iranian compensation to formercompany by strict application of British law nationalising coal or any otherindustry. He had subsequently examined coal nationalisation law and had con-cluded I was right. Law was complicated and difficult to understand. It containedmany provisions which had no relationship whatsoever to Iranian Oil problem.He and his advisers now believed it would not be practicable for Court to applylaw this kind to present dispute. They therefore wished to amend suggestions which they had made previously. He handed me document in Persian, translation of which contained next paragraph.3. &quot; (1) The Iranian Government accepts judgment by the I.C.J. with regardto &apos; property and establishments &apos; of the Oil Company in Iran on the basis of anyone law relating to nationalisation of industries in England which would be acceptable to the Company.. &quot; (2) In case this proposal is not agreeable to the Oil Company, the Companymay determine which one of the laws relating to nationalisation of industries it43641Copy
would like to have as basis of the judgment by the I.C.J., and it may also specifythe principles of such law which are agreeable to the Company as the basis of judgment, in order that the question may receive consideration.,.....,,    &quot; (3) Inasmuch as it may take a long time to refer the case to the judgment of the I.C.J. and obtain a result (and whereas) the Iranian Government would liketo settle the difference as soon as possible, the Iranian Government desires the oil company to name the amount of compensation to which it considers itself entitled(regardless of Iran counter-claims). Perhaps the question of comnensation canbe settled by direct negotiation and without reference to the Court.&quot;^4. Saleh translated this document aloud paragraph by paragraph. At endfirst paragraph I asked Mosaddiq if I was to understand he now wished terms ofreference expressly to limit compensation to &quot; property and establishments &quot; of oil Company in Iran. He replied in affirmative, adding that in any event coalnationalisation law not applicable to situation in Iran.&apos; In England owners of mineshad title to them. In Iran former company did not own any land or subsoilminerals. It owned merely certain physical property above ground and had rightto exploit and refine oil. Iran willing to permit Company to claim compensationfor losses of physical property above ground but not for loss of rights to exploit orrefine. If Iran should be willing to agree to pay compensation for loss of such rights that would mean that it would be agreeing to pay compensation for loss of future profits.   Iran could not do that.5. I reminded Prime Minister of (Sinqct) [sic] four previous conversations. Hehad explicitly told me that he would be willing to permit Arbitration Board to settlequestion compensation on basis any British law nationalising a British industryacceptable to former company; and that in answer to questions put by me he had stated that such basis for settlement would be agreeable to him even though Britishlaw selected would provide for payment to former owners of compensation for lossof future profits. It was on basis this statement to me that our present conversa-tions had been inaugurated He said he did not remember making such statement to me. We had discussed many things. He thought, however, he had always made it clear that Iran would not agree to any arrangement which might involve paymentof compensation for loss future profits. In any event, he had emphasised through-out our talks that anything he might say was subject to approval of Majlis. Hewas convinced from talking with his advisers that Majlis would not agree to anyformula which might make it possible for British to claim compensation for lossof future profits. I told Prime Minister that if that was his position, I feared all our conversations had been in vain. I was convinced, as I had told him in con-versation of 25th December, that British could not accept terms of reference whichwould limit compensation to losses resulting from confiscation of physical propertyof Company in Iran. I was sure that whole business world would consider that company was right in insisting that in determination of compensation losses,of future profits should be given consideration. If his position as now outlined tome should be conveyed to British our conversations would probably be terminated.6. Mosaddiq indicated considerable distress, maintaining he anxious for settlement. He suggested that second paragraph of document be translated beforefurther discussion. This paragraph might serve as alternative if first paragraphunacceptable. Saleh translated second paragraph. I said I did not think it would serve any useful purpose for Company to specify principles of any British law as suggested in this paragraph since Mosaddiq had already made it clear that hewould not accept any formula which would make it possible for Company to claimcompensation for other than physical property in Iran. Prime Minister said he didnot see why presentation of this document would mean termination of conversa-tions. If British did not like suggestions contained in it they could give counter-suggestions. I said British had already presented their formula in proposals whichI had handed him on 15th January. He had not really replied to British formula.Instead he was proposing new formulas which had no real resemblance to sugges-tion of British. Mosaddiq asked that third paragraph be translated. I told him that this paragraph, if given consideration, would transfer our conversations intoarea which I not in position to enter. Both British and Iranian Governments had indicated their agreement for United States to carry on conversations in an endeavour achieve oil settlement on basis international arbitration or adjudicationof question of compensation. Paragraph 3 seemed to suggest discussion of lump sum settlement. I had no authority discuss this kind of settlement. I would submit
document in question to United States Government but in doing so I would informit that I had told him I unable discuss suggestions of kind contained in paragraph 3.7. Mosaddiq reverted to paragraph 2 of document. He said he would be willing to consider principles involving compensation for loss of future profits pro-vided he was sure that amount to be claimed would not be exorbitant. His advisershad told him that Majlis would never agree to oil settlement involving risk eventhough remote that Court might find Iran liable to pay compensation for loss of profits amounting to  150,000,000 annually for 32 years. I tried to convince himhis fears groundless. Judges of Court were reasonable men not likely hand downdecisions so ridiculous. He insisted that risk existed. If British would let him know what was maximum amount which it would claim he might agree, if that amountwas not too exorbitant, that Court could adjudicate claim with terms of referenceincluding compensation for loss of future profits. If British desired to know sizeIran&apos;s claims he would be willing give it in return.8. I told Mosaddiq I disappointed that we seemed so rapidly to be approach-ing deadlock. I had entertained hopes that settlement might be achieved on abasis which would leave Iran master of its own oil industry, would offer Iran oppor-tunity sell oil abroad on commercial basis, would afford guarantee Iran would notbe saddled with burden indebtedness greater than it could bear, which would pro-vide Iran funds to meet its financial needs until oil reserves would again begin toaccrue. Mosaddiq said I had failed in one respect. I had not been able to guarantee that Iran would not be saddled with burden of indebtedness greater than it couldbear. I said if Iran would be called upon to pay its indebtedness only from 25 percent, of proceeds derived from sale of oil, burden would not be unbearable. Unfor-unfortunately Iranian Government apparently was not willing even to bear this relativelylight burden. Mosaddiq said it might be willing to bear such burden if it knewnumber of years involved. Over how many years would Iran be expected to pay?I said that would depend upon judgment of Court. Mosaddiq said on a basis ofthis kind it would not be necessary to go to Court. He would be willing to present to Majlis agreement whereby for certain number of years Iran would pay in settle-ment compensation 25 per cent, of gross proceeds from its oil export. only question to be settled was number of years. That could be settled in conversationof one hour if British were agreeable. Difficulty with lump sum method would beto satisfy public opinion in Iran and United Kingdom. Method of definite numberof years but indefinite global amount would be much easier to sell at least toIranian public. Another advantage of this method would be that Company wouldin sense become partner of Iran. Both would want to sell as much Iranian oil aspossible. I told Mosaddiq I unable discuss this kind of settlement with him. i could only discuss settlement based upon international arbitration or adjudicationof compensation.9. Mosaddiq said he hoped some way could be found to prevent terminationof conversations. It was important not only to Iran but to world that dispute besettled. I repeated in view of position which he had this evening assumed I could,for moment at least, see no way avoiding deadlock.10. My tentative comment. I do not think that Mosaddiq could have failedto realise that decision of himself and advisers that terms of reference must beworded so as to limit compensation to loss of physical property of Company in Iranwould destroy all possibility of settlement of compensation by international arbitra-tion or adjudication. He hoped, therefore, to be able to shift conversations toanother basis, that of reaching agreement on lump sum to be paid as compensationor preferably on definite period of years over which Iran would pay 25 per cent, of gross proceeds from oil exports as compensation.
