(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret(53) 27 copy NO^23rd JANUARY, 1953.CABINETPROJECT FOR A TRANSATLANTIC TELEPHONE CABLEMemorandum by the Postmaster general by about I960 we shall have exhausted the possibilities of adding circuitsto satisfy the growing requirements of transatlantic telephone traffic.   but even today the present service, dependent as it is on radio, is far fromsatisfactory.   Bad atmosphere conditions result in our not being able toconnect about 20 per cent of the booked calls and many of the calls thatare made are not of good quality.   For this reason much attention has beengiven to the possibility of establishing a satisfactory service by a submarinecable.2.    This question was brought to a head during last summer by an approach to me by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, who are anxiousto proceed as soon as possible with the construction of a cable.   The PostOffice has worked very happily with the Company on other projects, notably thepioneering of transatlantic radio telephony twenty-five years ago, and theCompany have made it quite clear that they would much prefer to undertake a joint scheme with us with the cable landing in this country.   On the otherhand, it is quite clear that, if we were unwilling to co-operate, they would then proceed on their own or in conjunction with others on a route which would beless favourable and less useful to us.3. Before bringing this matter to the notice of my colleagues i thought it right that my experts should consult the American Telephone and telegraph Company without commitment on either side in order to ascertain the technical and financial considerations involved.   Annexed is a paperprepared by officials of the Post Office setting out the American.and british proposals in some detail and the pros and cons of each.4. For the reasons advanced in the Annex there are, I think, two courses of action open to us J(a) to attempt to insist on the project being delayed until the Britishsystem is proved and on that system being used throughout;(b) to go ahead on the basis that the American system will beused for the main transatlantic crossing provided that -(i) the British system shall be used between Newfoundland andNova Scotia;(ii) an understanding is reached that any second cable will belaid to this country.
It?5. The advantages of course (a) from the United Kingdom point ofview are obvious;   it would save the British Exchequer a sum of the order of 2 millions, as compared with course (b), and it would enhance Britishtechnical and commercial prestige.   Its drawback is the unlikelihood of its being entertained by the Americans.   While no doubt they are in large measureactuated by motives of profit and prestige, they are also genuinely anxiousto improve the quality of service (whether to the United Kingdom or to theContinent) at an early date;  and whatever the difficulties and possibilities,I think it would be unwise to count on their being deterred from proceedingwithout us to lay a cable to the Continent, whether in partnership with other european countries or alone.   If we let this opportunity go it is unlikely that the americans would co-operate so willingly with us later.6. We should therefore, in my opinion, be wise to negotiate with the americans on the basis of course (b)s  It is true that the greater share inthe prestige value of the undertaking will be theirs;  but we propose to insist on the use of our system for the 650 miles link between Newfoundland andNova Scotia.   In this way we shall not only be able to gain experience fromthe practical use of our own system but its success would demonstrate theadvantages of our more modern and more economic design.   We might hope toreap the full advantage of this condition if we insist, as I propose, (for reasons give in the Annex) that the second transatlantic cable, when it is required,shall also be laid to the United Kingdom.7. It is, of course, impossible to predict what the American reactionwill be.   They might reject these conditions in favour of an independentproject via the Azores to the Continent but the difficulties facing them will be serious.   Certainly on grounds of traffic and engineering, cable-laying and cable-manufacturing skill, resources and experience, we can make a muchmore solid contribution to a joint undertaking than any other country or countries,8. Although the project stands firmly on its own feet as a commercialproposition, it offers certain other advantages, notably more secure communicationfor military needs, not subject to interruption by atmospheric conditions.9. A further advantage is that if the scheme goes forward now it islikely that the grreater part of the cable will be made in the United kingdom as submarine cable-making facilities in the United States of America are limited in comparison with our own, and Post Office resources for layingcable are the best in the world.   On the other hand, if we break with the americans over this project there is a real risk that when the radio facilities are saturated by about I960, we may become dependent on an American-ownedcable via the Azores.10. Any project for a submarine telephone cable has a bearing also ontransatlantic telegraphy as the resources of a telephone cable could be usedto provide many telegraph channels.   The present position, which is of longstanding, is not altogether satisfactory since the bulk of the transatlantictraffic in both directions is in the hands of American cable companies.   But anyradical re-organisation would involve protracted and difficult discussions withthe American Government and American  commercial interests.   such negotiations would undoubtedly delay agreement and might even imperil the entireproject without giving prospect of a financial return which would justifytaking this risk.   The delay imposed on the telephone project would be mostunwelcome to the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and mightimpelthemto proceed independently with their alternative project via the Azores.After consideration therefore I am in favour of a separate approach to the telephone project, leaving the telegraph aspects for further study.   To safeguard the position it is my intention that we should propose to the American Government
that the use of the cable for telegraphs to the U.S.A. should be left open for further consideration, with the exception that we should seek their immediate agreement to routing in the cable any necessary private telegraphcircuits for inter &quot;governmental use.   I should also propose to notify theCompany that we must have full freedom to reserve some of the capacity of the telephone cable for telegraphs to other destinations than the U.S.A., inparticular to Canada.11. &quot;With regard to the Canadian Government, my intention is that nothing shall be left undone to keep them fully advised, as they have been upto the present.   They will certainly be interested in the use of the cable for communication between the United Kingdom and canada and they might possiblywish to share in the financing of the project.   With regard to the latter point,it may be, on the other hand, they they will rely on the machinery of theCommonwealth Telecommunications Board to give them all the facilitiesthey require in a cable provided by the Americans and ourselves.   If theydo not wish to participate in the capital cost I would not press them;  ajoint venture by the Americans and ourselves has the great advantageof simplifying the problem of provision, ownership, maintenance and control,and in the interests of paying for our communications as far as possible in sterling there is all to be said for magnifying, the element of sterlinginvestment in it.   If, contrary to expectation, the Canadian Government wishto share in the capital cost I should wish to consider this further with theChancellor and the Commonwealth Secretary.12. I ask my colleagues therefore to agree that -(a) we acquaint the Canadian Government of the proposal and seektheir views;(b) we seek discussion with the American Government on the generalaspects of the proposal;(c) in the light of (b) we open up negotiations with the AmericanTelephone and Telegraph Company on the basis of paragraph 11of the Annex either with or without Canadian financial participationaccording to the results of (a);(d) subject to the satisfactory conclusion of the negotiations, weproceed with the provision of the cable, on the understanding thatthe capital cost to the British Government would not, withoutTreasury approval, be permitted to exceed  5 millions payable in sterling and that this would be additional to the normal Post Officecapital investment programme.15. The Treasury and other interested Departments, including theMinistry of Defence and the Commonwealth Relations Office, have been consulted and the proposals contained in this Memorandum have their general support.D.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.I.23rd January, 1953.
Shortcomingsof radio.Technicaladvances incabletelephony.american proposals.1,    At present all telephone communication between the UnitedKingdom on the one hand and Canada and the U.S.A. on the other is byradio.   Traffic is growing and, because of increasing congestion in the frequency bands usable for long distance services, it will not be possibleto cater for growth beyond about 1960.   Moreover radio circuits are not satisfactory due to prolonged and unpredictable fade-outs which occurwhen propagation conditions are bad.   Through the year as many as20 per cent of booked calls cannot be completed for this reason.   Itappears unlikely that any new radio technique, or early improvement in existing techniques, will be adequate to provide for an improved and expanding service.   Further, radio circuits, apart from their liability to interruption, are inherently non-secret and do not readily lendthemselves to use for defence purposes,2. For about twenty years British and American engineers havebeen considering the possibility of providing telephone communication between the U.S.A. and the United Kingdom by cable, and an Americanproject for a telephone cable in 1928 reached an advanced stage before being abandoned owing to the economic depression.   Until recently,however, the proposition was never attractive economically.   Recentadvances in submerged amplifiers, with long expectation of life, havealtered the position and the American Telephone and Telegraph company and the British Post Office have both been considering a transatlanticcable between this country and Newfoundland with an extension cablebetween Newfoundland and a point on the Atlantic seaboard, probably innovations Scotia,   Such a system would give about thirty telephone circuitsas compared with fourteen radio circuits at present in use and amaximum radio capacity of about twenty.3. The American proposals embody the use of two cables, onetransmitting speech in one direction,   the other in the reverse direction.The proposals are based on twenty years of research and development;the design was fixed in its main features in 1940 and therefore does not use modern valves and other components.   On the other hand the longintervening period has allowed all its elements to be subject to the test of long experiment and field trial.   The system has given Z\ yearstrouble-free service between Havana and Key West in substantially the form in which it.would be employed in the transatlantic project.   Ifthe decision to go ahead were given now a system of this kind could probably be installed and in operation by the end of 1956,British 4, The British proposals, by the- use of larger amplifiers, and proposals.       modern valves and components, envisage &quot;go&quot; and &quot;return&quot; speech paths inone cable.   Post Office engineers were actually the first to constructand install one of these amplifiers in a working telephone cable.   this they did in the Irish Sea in 1943.   Nineteen British-constructedamplifiers have subsequently been installed in European waters and have served to increase the traffic capacity of existing cables by between fiveand ten times.   Our engineers have, however, only recently been ableto turn their attention to re-design of their system for use at thedepths occurring in mid-Atlantic;  and there has not been time to complete the re-design.   In particular, it has to be demonstrated that the layingin deep water of a cable of the British design with its larger amplifiersdoes not involve undue hazards;  this is being tested during the summer of 1953.   But even with the amount of development and testing still to be done there is every prospect that a system of this kind could bej
installed on the main part of the transatlantic crossing between 1958and I960.Views of 5. Both systems have been examined in detail by the technical experts. experts of the Post Office and of the Bell Telephone Laboratories whojointly recommend that, if the project is to go forward in the near future the American system should be installed on the main link betweenNewfoundland and this country because of its proved reliability.   they point out that proved reliability is an essential requirement in thispioneering and difficult venture, and that whenever the first cable isinstalled, proved reliability will have to be paid for by the installation of a system whi ch does not make use of the most up-to-date techniques and is therefore relatively expensive.   The extension cable betweenNewfoundland and Nova Scotia presents an easier technical problem as the depths are not so great and fewer amplifiers will be required.   this gives a somewhat longer time for development before construction mustcommence.   The experts therefore recommend delaying a decisions with regard to this part of the route until the latest possible date in orderthat the British system should be considered.Cost, 6. At present day British prices&apos; fch^ capital costs of the schemesmentioned in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 are very roughly -  millions(i) System of American design throughout 9 to 1Z(ii) System of British design throughout 5 to 8(iii) System using American design on mainlink and the British design on theextension link 8 to 11Although the most expensive scheme would naturally be the leastprofitable, all three schemes can reasonably be expected to pay for themselves on the basis of present day tariffs and of a twenty yearslife.   The revenue from the estimated traffic should very substantiallyexceed expenditure.AmericanCompany&apos;attitude onneed forcable.7. The American Company regard the need for the cable asurgent and they are pressing that its provision should go ahead now.   Forour part, while the unreliable nature and relatively poor quality of thepresent radio system is recognised, we should be prepared to make itsuffice until about I960 if, by that time, it would be possible to installa proved cable system of the much cheaper British design with the fulladvantages that this would bring to British prestige and exports.possible courses ofaction.8. Three courses of action are open -(i)     to go ahead now on the basis that the American system will be used for the main transatlantic crossing andwith no guarantee that the British system will be usedon the link between Newfoundland and Nova Scotia;(ii)   to go ahead on the basis that the American system willbe used for the main transatlantic crossing but to insist that the British system shall be used betweenNewfoundland and Nova Scotia even though this might involve some delay to the completion of the overallproject and also that certain other conditions (specifiedin paragraph 11 below) shall be fulfilled.
(iii)    to insist on the project being delayed until theBritish system is proved and on that system being used throughout.9.   In assessing these alternatives the following are pertinentcons ide rations: -(a) because of the research and development effort which theBell Telephone Laboratories have already invested in theirsystem it is in any case unlikely that the americans would consent to  any first project of which their systemdid not form a substantial part.   In addition, they are anxiousto improve the quality of the transatlantic telephone service at an early date;(b) the real desire of the Americans is believed to be for acable to this country mainly on the grounds that trafficrequirements necessitate it by about I960 and that it willmore than pay for itself:  also because, in a pioneeringventure of this sort, they would welcome us as a partner, notonly in the capital and subsequent costs, but because of theexperience that we could bring to bear on a project of this kind;(c) failing agreement with us the Americans have stated their intention of proceeding with a cable to the continent (probablyvia the Azores):  in that event we have little ground forcounting on their willing co-operation with us later in layinga cable to this country;(d) we have every reason to fear that even if the first cable comes to this country, the Americans will wish to take the second to theContinent.   We, for our part, should wish any second cable tocome to this country, first because part of its additional capacity will probably be required for our own traffic in aboutfifteen years1 time, and second, because it would act as a stand-by to the first cable;   and third, because to have bothcables feeding into our system would give us a dominantposition in North Atlantic communications;(e) Anglo-Canadian traffic will not support an Anglo-Canadiancable within the foreseeable future unless trafficincreases much beyond present expectations;(f) if the scheme goes forward it is likely that the greater partof the cable will be made in the United Kingdom as submarinecable-making facilities in the U.S.A. are limited while our ownSubmarine Cables Limited are relatively well-equipped to manufacture and Post Office resources for laying cable arethe best in the world.10. With regard to (c), there is reason to doubt whether the americans would find a European partner in the capital and other costs of atransatlantic cable:  moreover it is unlikely, to say the least, on puretraffic grounds, that such a cable would pay for itself as early as one tothe United Kingdom.   Nevertheless, it would be unwise to under-rate the americans in this regard:  they may well do as they suggest if we refuseto come in.   Apart from our need for a transatlantic cable and thefact that it would more than pay for itself, it is highly desirable in theConsiderationsto be borne in mind.
interests of our export trade and of our prestige in the telecommunications sphere that we should participate in the firsttransatlantic project of this kind.   Moreover, if we let this opportunity for timely co-operation with the Americans pass, it islikely that, being unable to obtain their co-operation later, we shall be compelled to route some of our traffic over an American cable afterI960, which will involve heavy dollar out-payments.Recommend- 11. The considerations set out in the preceding twoations. paragraphs lead to the conclusion that insistence on the use of theBritish system throughout (course (iii)) is impolitic.   On the other hand,no reason is seen why we should fall in entirely with American wishes(course (i)).   Our system is sufficiently advanced technically, and ourbargaining position strong enough, to justify us in stipulating that our participation in a scheme using the American system for the main linkshall be conditional on -(i) the use of the British system between Newfoundland andNova Scotia and(ii) reaching an understanding that the second cable when itis installed will be to this country.In any case we should have to make the following further conditions -(a) that the cable shall be so routed as to give access tothe Canadian communications network;(b) that our provision in kind shall be no less than our capitalcontribution, i. e. its provision shall not involve us in expenditure of foreign currency;(c) that the arrangements for the maintenance and upkeepof the cable shall not involve us in dollar expenditure;(d) that we should be entitled (on appropriate financial terms)to use the cable to any desired extent for telegraph as wellas telephone purposes to places other than U.S.A.;(e) that the future use of the cable for telegraphs between theU.S.A. and the United Kingdom should remain an openquestion, except that its use for inter-governmental leasedcircuits should be permitted.12. Some explanation of conditions (d) and (e) may bedesirable.   Any one of the telephone circuits which the cable will givecan be used to provide twelve telegraph circuits and it would bedesirable to take the opportunity to strengthen the commonwealth communities system by supplementing in this way the limitedtelegraph cable capacity now available to Canada.   As regards (e)although we have given American Telegraph Compani s the right toland telegraph cables in this country and to operate here we havebeen refused similar privileges in the U.S.A.    Our present telegraphcommunication to the U.S.A. is by radio which is subject to the samedisabilities as the radio telephone service;  this places us at a disadvantage with our American competitors (who in fact carry some85 per cent of the transatlantic telegraph traffic) and at an appropriate time we should want to use the cable if possible as a lever for a revision of the position.
Canadian 13. There remains the question of Canadian participationparticipation. in the project.   At first sight there might seem to be advantages in attracting a substantial Canadian contribution to the cost and asecond Commonwealth voice in the management of the cable.   ButCanada&apos;s telephone traffic interest is relatively small,,   Further,the cable would no doubt be regarded by the CommonwealthTelecommunications Board as part of the commonwealth communities system.   This being so the use of the cable wouldbe open to the Commonwealth partners on the Board, with a liabilityon them to contribute to the costs of maintenance, depreciation etc.incurred by the United Kingdom on a basis which has been agreed for the rest of the system.   Canada&apos;s share of these costs would bea small one.   There would be therefore no inducement for her to come in on the capital cost except on terms which would almost certainlymake for difficulty with the American Company.   Moreover, toincrease the dollar capital invested in the cable would inevitably involve us in dollar payments for use of the cable.   It is not therefore proposed to press Canada on the point, especially asfrom such unofficial soundings as have been taken this would accord with her views.
