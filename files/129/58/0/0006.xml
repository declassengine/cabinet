36CABINETPERSIAN  PIEMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign. Affairs.In the light of the reports we have received from the State Departmentof Mr. Henderson&apos;s recent conversations with Dr. Musaddiq and the discussions which the Persian Oil (Official) Committee have had with Mr, Byroade0Assistant Secretary of State in the State Departments the positions of theparties appear to be as follows:-A.    MUSADDIQ&apos;S position.    Arbitration   He is ready to go to international arbitration on compensation,   Ke seems disposed to make no difficulties(a) about the form of arbitration and has offered two alternatives,both of which would regard the dispute as one between thePersian Government and the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A0IoO0Co);(b) about the terms of reference for the arbitrators9 which heapparently is willing to agree to be based on any Englishnationalisation law acceptable to A.I.O.C.;(c) about signing an arbitration agreement with Her Majesty*sGovernment acting for A.I.O.C.2.     Financial AidPie expects SI 00 millions from the United States Government as an advance against oil deliveries.   He hopes to receive at least half the sumas soon as the arbitration agreement is signed and will not agree to paymentsbeing contingent on a commercial sales agreement.   Alternatively, if theBritish dislike direct dollar aid to Persia, he will accept substantial Americansales of sugar on credit to tide Persia over the next two months03,    Sales of OilHe will wait to see how 1 and 2 work out before considering towhom Persian oil shall be sold.   He will be willing to sell to the UnitedStates Government (or to an American company willing to pay in advance),but is not ready to commit himself to long-term contracts with the AQI.O.C,or an A.I000C. subsidiary.   He fears that if AoIoO0C. purchase the bulk of persian oil, Her Majesty&apos;s Government may at any time cause A.I000C, tobreak their contract as a means of putting political pressure on Persia,   Hewould, however, consider sales to A.I.O.C. if the company put down $200 millions as a forfeit, or sales to an international company, not registered in the UnitedSECRET ^ ,...../C,(53) 6 - COPY NO.       /   f/6th JANUARY, 1953,
Kingdom, in which A.I.O.C. might participate,   (Though Musaddiq did not say-so to Mrc Henderson, his unwillingness to commit himself now to commercial negotiations is possibly partly due to his -belief that the United StatesMarketing Council Inc. (Marcus) will fulfil its contract for the bulk of persian oil and pay ^50 millions in advance),,   /B,    HER MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;S POSITIONWe contemplate a &quot;package&quot; arrangement tying up the threeelements of the Joint Proposals, viz,(i)  arbitrations(ii) commercial negotiations for oil purchases;(iii) financial aid.(i)  Arbitration(a) On the form of arbitration we can probably reach agreementsthough someone will need to explain to Musaddiq the limitations arising fromThe Hague Court&apos;s own statutes which require that disputes before it mustbe between States,   We could agree to the President of the Court being consulted to see how the Court could help;  but in view of doubts about the propriety of the Court acting in a dispute which is not between States, weshould not ourselves approach the President.(b) We should also be able to agree on terms of reference.   Itmay be possible for us to use the Coal Nationalisation Act as a good precedent,but there is a possibility that Musaddiq might twist the terms of that Actagainst us.   This has been examined with the company, and a suggestedformula (see Annex) with which the Foreign Office Legal A.dviser agrees,has been approved by the Company&apos;s Board.(c) We can welcome the indication that Musaddiq is ready to sign the arbitral agreement with Her Majesty!s Government, even if the A0I0O.C0is the party.(ii)   Commercial Negotiations for Oil PurchasesSo far as concerns action by Her Majesty!s Government, the JointProposals said that we would agree to arbitration and to the appointment ofrepresentatives of A.I.O.C. to negotiate with the Persian Government for the flow of oil from Iran to world markets;  finan .ial aid from the United states would then follow.   In our explanatory note of 14th October, we said A.I.O.C.would be ready to open negotiations as soon as agreement was reached onarbitration.   We did not insist on a monopoly for A0IaO.C., nor do we nowclaim priority for them in the commercial negotiations.   To get the oilmoving^ however, is an essential part of the &quot;package&quot; arrangements, bothon the general grounds that a settlement without oil is no settlement, andalso because compensation cannot be effectively paid without substantial oilsales.   In fact, the major purchaser will have to be A.I.O.C, as they alonehave the transport facilities and the markets.   Moreover, the big UnitedStates companies will not buy Persian oil unless A.I.O.C. buys the bulk of it.We would prefer a new A.I.O.C. subsidiary to act as purchaser, not only forA.I.O.C. but also for the United States Government and the United States oil companies, but we might consider an international consortium provided thatA.I.O.C. has the largest share in it.   We would not agree to such purchasesbeing negotiated by or made through an unknown entity such as the &quot;U.S. MarketingCouncil Inc. &quot; which claims to have signed a contract with Musaddiq for thebulk of Persian oil.
In earlier exchanges with the Americans we have stressed theimportance of keeping separate the discussions with the Persians on arbitration and on oil purchases., since we felt we would not get Persian agreement tothe former if, as in the past., it was confused with detailed discussions regarding the latter0   We hoped to use the latter as a bait to secure Persianacceptance of international arbitration.   It now seems, however, that what has tempted Musaddiq to agree to arbitration is the prospect of $100 millions and the Marcus offer, and that while he is interested in the idea of a consortium including the A.I.O.C he will not yet commit himself0(iii)   Financial and the  Joint Proposals included an American grant of $10 millions as soon as the Persians agreed to arbitration and to  opening commercial negotiations with A.I.O.C.  Mr. Henderson has recently told Dr0 Musaddiqthat the United States Government were ready to advance $10 millionsagainst future oil purchases, as soon as an agreement is reached on compensation.   While we have no objection in principle to aid of this size,we consider it essential that(a) the aid should be paid in instalments;(b) the first payment should be accompanied by an agreement byDr. Musaddiq to open negotiations for commercial contracts withA.I.O.C. or its subsidiary, or at least with an international, company in which A.I.O.C. participates, and further instalments should be related to the progress of the negotiations;(c) the price fixed in the American contract at which oil iseventually to be supplied against the advances should be in keeping with the 50/50 profit-sharing arrangements in other oil concessions.If these conditions were not fulfilled Musaddiq&apos;s incentive to reach asettlement would be greatly reduced;  there would be no certainty of anycommercial negotiations with A.I.C.C.;  and, in the event of such negotiations,questions of price and quantities would be seriously prejudiced and the50:50 principle would be undermined.We shall wish to conclude with Musaddiq an agreement which will cover (i) and (ii) above.   It will also be necessary to include provisions forthe immunity of A.I.O.C. vessels and personnel, and for payment to escrowof a proportion of Persian earnings from oil sales against the arbitration award,C.    THE UNITED STATES POSITION: *   -0   Arbitrat ion the Americans are now supporting us wholeheartedly in urgingMusaddiq to accept our arbitration proposals, in insisting that compensationmust take account of future profits and that agreement on arbitration mustprecede financial aid.   Like us, they foresee no great difficulty in reaching agreement on the form of arbitration and the terms of reference.2.   Commercial Negotiations for Oil PurchasesThe Americans are anxious to see maximum sales of Persian oil to or through the big companies, both as a means of saving Persia and of protecting world prices and other oil concessions from the disruptive effects
of cheap oil sales to small firms.   They recognise that A.I.O.C, must be the major purchaser and Mr. Henderson has impressed this on Dr, Musaddiq,They like our suggestions as to how sales of oil should be arranged,   Theyare clearly disappointed that the United States companies are reluctant to buy Persian oil and will not move without AcIeO,C.  Their attitude to the contract signed with the U.S. Marketing Council Inc, is equivocal and may be explained by their failure to stimulate the big United States companies to action to save Persia.   They are concerned lest Musaddiq&apos;s reluctance tonegotiate with A.I.O.C, will cause him to go back on the arbitration offer9and seem to favour clinching  arbitration without first ensuring adequatecommercial negotiations on the flow of oil.   On the other hand they haveadmitted to being extremely concerned at the prospect of the exclusion ofA.I.O,C0, since this would prevent the major United States companies fromparticipating and would set a deplora .le precedent.   They believe that asatisfactory solution would be the formation of an international company,registered in Switzerland, in which A.I.Q.C. would have something less thana half share, with Shell and French and U.S. companies taking the remainder,AoLCC and Shell together would have control of the company,,3o     Financial and the  American proposals for making $100 millions advance availableto the Persians provide for payment in instalments but fail to satisfy theconditions at B(iii)(b) above.   As regards (b) the Americans are convinced thatMusaddiq will not accept any advance of money tied to negotiations for along-term commercial sales agreement, and that without the bait of animmediate payment he will not agree to arbitration.   As regards B(iii)(c) theAmericans1 present ideas on the prices to be written into their contractappear to be satisfactory, because this allows for 25 per cent of the proceeds of sales to be placed in a neutral account against the arbitration award.The Americans hold that insistence on (b) would arouse resentment in persia and would wreck the negotiations0D.   DISCUSSIONS WITH MR. BYROADEI        We have told the Americans that we attach importance to treatingarbitration, advances by the United States Government and commercial negotiations to get the oil moving as being all part of one &quot;package&quot; proposal.We would see grave objections to Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreeing to asettlement which on the one hand involved a compromise on the terms ofreference for arbitration contemplated in the Joint Proposals and increasedAmerican monetary advances against doubtful supplies of oil, and yet on theother hand made no arrangements for commercial sales of oil (on which the persians&apos; ability to pay compensation depend) and virtually excluded A.1,0,0,as a major purchaser.   Such a settlement would be politically unacceptablein the United Kingdom and would adversely affect oil concessions elsewhere.While therefore3 for tactical reasons vis-a-vis Musaddiq we would beprepared to examine sympathetically the suggestions on arbitration which haveemerged from Mr. Henderson&apos;s conversations with Musaddiq, we could not finally accept these suggestions until satisfactory assurances had beenobtained about commercial sales of oil to A.I.O.C.    Mr. Byroade, whileunder standing our&apos;point of view, is fearful lest, by insisting on a &quot;package&quot;deal, we should lose the present opportunity of securing satisfactoryarbitration, which he claims has now been made possible by the $100 millions,offer.2.   We have told Mr. Byroade that,(a)  we would examine Musaddiq&apos;s suggestion of an internationalcompany, without commitment, but that there might be serious objections;
40(b)  we hoped to be able to suggest draft terms of reference for arbitration within the next day or two,   We recognised the desirability of allowing ivlr. Henderson to give some reply on our behalf, indicating our sympathetic interest in DrD Musaddiq1arbitration proposals, in the hope that this would keep themalive while we examine the more difficult problem of getting the oil flowing,   I will raise this point orally in Cabinets,E. conclusions,    We should continue our efforts to persuade the Americans to agreethat the question of arbitration, the opening of negotiations to get the oilmoving, and advance payments by the United States Government are ailpart of one &quot;package&quot; proposal.   It may, however, be necessary for tacticalreasons to continue to discuss arbitration with Dr. Musaddiq in order togive us time in which to examine the other problems, in conjunction with the americans.2.    We cannot agree to refer to arbitration without some assurance that there will be genuine arrangements for marketing Persian oil to companiesincluding A.I.O.C. or its subsidiary, or to an international company in whichA0I,O0C, participates.3.    We should try to persuade the Americans to revise their scheme for making the SI 00 millions advance payments so that the first paymentshall be accompanied by an agreement on the part of Dr. Musaddiq to open negotiations for commercial contracts with A.I,0,C. or its subsidiary,or at least with an international company in which A,I00,C. participates^, andthat further instalments shall be related to the progress of the negotiations,,4, We must ensure that the United States Government contract providesfor the allocation of 25 per cent of the proceeds to a neutral account againstthe arbitration award.5,      The U.S, Marketing Council Inc, must be removed from the scene if mr. Henderson&apos;s negotiations are to have any chance of success.F. recommendations i invite my colleagues  to agree:-(i) that in further discussions with the United States we should insist that any final settlement must include all the elements ofthe &quot;package&quot; described under B above;(ii) that, whether we seek arbitration before the International court or before some other tribunal^ the terms of reference may be asproposed in the Annex.(iii) that the suggestion of the creation of an international organisation,registered abroad, for the purchasing and marketing of Persian oil,in which A.I.O,C. would be represented, shall be examined urgentlyin consultation with the A.I.O,C.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.5th January, 1953.
4\annex the terms of reference of the Tribunal shall be:-(I)   To determine the sum required to provide fair compensation to theCompany for the loss of the property, rights and interests in Iranheld by the Company immediately prior to the passing of the iranian Oil Nationalisation Laws of March and May, 1951,and for that purpose the Tribunal shall ascertain the amount which such property, rights and interests might have been expectedto realise if sold as one unit in the open market as property,rights and interests of a going concern by a willing seller to awilling buyer on the basis of(a) the net annual maintainable revenue, that is to say, the net annual revenue which the Company might reasonably have been expected to earn in the future from its operations in Iran if the iranian laws in question had not been passed;(b) the number of years purchase to be applied to such net annualmaintainable revenue.(2)   To determine the validity of any counter claims which the Iranian government may have against the A.I.O.C. and the sum requiredto meet them.note the foregoing provisions would require to be completed by an overall agreement, and this agreement would have to contain provisions aboutthe form and method of payment of any compensation awarded, and also as toescrow.   Thus:Her Majesty&apos;s Government consider that any balance of compensationdue to the Company in consequence of the award of theTribuynal should bepaid either by depositing 25 per cent of the gross proceeds of the sale of oil and oil products by the National Iranian Oil Company in a trust account or with a trustee bank for transfer.to the Company, or else if so agreed between the iranian Government and the Company by deliveries of oil to the company in such quantities and over such a period of years as shall be agreed between them?If a balance of compensation is due from the Company to the Iranian government in consequence of the Courfs award, it shall be discharged bypayments in cash of such amounts over such periods of years as shall beagreed between the Iranian Government and the Company;Pending the award of the Tribunal 25 per cent of the gross proceeds,of the sales of oil and oil products should be set aside in a neutral account to await the outcome of the arbitration.
