Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953SECRET Copy No.C. (53) 98th January, 1953CABINETPERSIANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum received fromthe United States Embassy on 7th January, 1953, giving further views of theUnited States Ambassador, Teheran, on the prospects of a settlement of the oildispute.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,8th January, 1953.MemorandumFollowing are Ambassador Henderson&apos;s reactions to specific points whichhave come up during the course of discussions here:  1. It is my hope that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will not try to &quot; distil &quot; theessential points of the terms of reference of the Coal Act&apos;s compensation tribunal,thereby affording Musaddiq a chance to add to them. Musaddiq will not give his acceptance to terms of reference which are spelled out in a way which would makeit publicly clear on their face that he is in agreement that the International Courtof Justice can request Iran to compensate for the loss of future profits. WhileMusaddiq has indicated his willingness to agree that Iran will do so, he is not willing to do it in language which is unveiled. If I should make a suggestion tohim involving terms of reference &quot; distilled &quot; in this way, he would feel that aftereverything he has told me in the past I was so dense that I had no unstanding of what I was doing, or else that I was being a party to a game of making sport of him. I am somewhat surprised that the United Kingdom is only now beginning toexamine the Coal Nationalisation Act as a possible basis for terms of reference.Last October, Middleton let me see extracts of the law which he had receivedfrom London.2. As I have previously indicated, if we attempt to tie up Defence MaterialsProcurement Agency purchase agreement and arbitration with a commercial salesagreement, Musaddiq would immediately suspect that what he feels is a &quot; trap &quot;which he has to date been able to avoid, has been laid with fresh bait. If Iapproached him on these lines, serious questions would be raised in his mind about our good faith in trying to assist to effect a settlement. At one time, Musaddiqmay have placed-some hope in such people as Marcus, but I am convinced, especiallyafter my last two long conversations with him, that he has now come to the realisation that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) is the backbone of sales43516
of Iranian oil abroad. However, I do not think that he can be moved from theposition which he is presently taking that after everything which has happened he is unable, in the face of public opinion in Iran, to enter at once into a contract withthe A.I.O.C. for the long-term sale of the bulk of exports of Iranian oil. There is,of course, the risk that once having received a $100 millions advance, Musaddiqmight attempt to live as a &quot; pensioner &quot;; also that reluctance to enter a commercialcontract might result in an inability to discharge the compensation award. It ispossible to compile a long list of real risks incurred by each party in connexionwith any international agreement of this character. I have attempted to makeMusaddiq comprehend that unless there is a mutual recognition of a certain amountof good faith, international commercial agreements cannot be concluded. I feel sure that in view of its rich experience the United Kingdom concurs with this.For myself, I now believe that there is a real desire on Musaddiq&apos;s part to have as soon as possible some kind of an arrangement with an international company which would assure Iran of a steady world market for its oil. In spite of Musaddiq&apos;sextreme nationalism, he would like to see the international business reputation ofhis country restored.3. I hope that the British will not be unduiy influenced by fear of what theMajlis might do. In obtaining a vote of 65 out of 66 in the Majlis to-day, despiteintrigues against him by such powerful figures as Baqai and Kashani, Musaddiqhas once more shown his ability to handle the Majlis in a situation of extreme difficulty. His present difficulties in the Majlis are partly due to resentment, evenby those most closely associated with him, at the absolute secrecy which he haspreserved regarding our present talks. The tenacity which he has shown in main-taining this secrecy under pressure indicates to me his real desire for a settlementof the oil problem. Except for the extreme nationalists, even his opponents saythat it would be easier for Musaddiq to sell an oil settlement to Iranian publicopinion and to the Majlis than it would be for them if they should come to power.4. I hope that the British will not look on my observations as indications ofundue impatience. I recognise the tremendous importance which this matterinvolves both for the present Government and for the nation. Although Musaddiqonce more might reverse himself by destroying everything which we have attempted to construct, I nevertheless think that just now there is within our grasp the elements of a settlement more fair to the United Kingdom than any which it is likely toget in the future. I also believe that if we should let this opportunity slip, it willlater be deeply regretted by the whole Western world.
