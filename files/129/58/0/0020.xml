(THIS--DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER- BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (53) 20 COPY NO.16th JANUARY, 1953.JAPAN AND THEGENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND trade memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the President of the Board of TradeJapan&apos;s application to enter into tariff negotiations with a view toaccession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) is to befurther considered at a meeting of the Inter sessional Committee of the contracting Parties starting on 2nd February under the terms of a resolution passed by them at their last session in October.   In this Resolution the contracting Parties, after recognising &quot;that Japan should take her rightfulplace in the community of trading nations and to that end should be admitted to appropriate international arrangements&quot;, agreed that&quot;in order that further consideration may be given to theconditions and timing under which the Japanese application should be pursued, an Inter sessional Committee should make a detailed examination of the matters involved in this application&quot;.2. This Resolution was passed primarily on our initiative, despite the readiness of many countries to admit Japan on a normal basis.   We can nolonger play for time.   We are now clearly committed to constructive efforts tofind terms on which we could agree to Japan&apos;s accession, though the resolution in no way commits us if these efforts should fail.3. Japan, with her expanding population and low cost economy, and lossof traditional markets and sources of supply, will not only need vigorously todevelop her exports, but may again be tempted to indulge in the more violentand disruptive competition that we experienced before the war.(This is explained more fully in the attached memorandum).    It is for these reasons that we, like our predecessors, have been extremely nervous, as the statements of Government policy reproduced in the Annex to the attached memorandum show, of the implications of assuming most-favoured-nationobligations to Japan, such as would be involved in her accession to the G.A.T.T.on normal terms.   Moreover, in the tariff concessions we have granted one another, we and other contracting parties have not in general had regard to thepossibility of Japanese accession, and it has been our contention that assumption of most-favoured-nation obligations to Japan entails the real risk that, in theevent of a serious revival of Japanese competition, the action countries would be forced to take to protect themselves would lead to an unravelling of tariffcommitments and a general raising of trade barriers contrary to our own interestsand the aims for which we have all been working.
4. On the other hand, although in the foreseeable future Japan will be aTJotential menace commercially to the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, shewill be a far greater menace if she is impelled by trade war with western countries towards communism.   Accordingly for political and strategic reasons of self-interest we must seek a commercial policy towards Japan which willkeep her aligned with us and prevent the great increase in communist power which would occur if Japan was pulled away from a western alignment by themagnet of the Soviet Union and Communist China.   We must also face the factthat a great majority of the contracting parties either favour Japanese accessionor think that we are exaggerating the risks involved.5. V/e shall anyway be confronted with strong Japanese competition over an increasing range of products.   While we may feel this in our home market, itis in our export markets, and in particular in our own Colonies, that the problemmight again be most acute.   There are, however, limits, which are narrowingwith the years, to our ability to influence our Colonial territories to take actionin favour of our exporting industries, against their own interests.   these limitations exist whether or not we assume obligations to Japan,6. In all the circumstances, the best course seems to lie in an endeavourto find generally acceptable terms for Japanese accession which would enableJapan to take her place in the community of free trading nations but which would permit us and other countries to take emergency action to safeguard ourselvesagainst the more extreme and disruptive manifestations of japanese competition, and would at the same time secure whatever advantages there maybe for us in observance by Japan of the obligations she would assume under theG.A.T.T.  The method (described more fully in paragraph 17 of the attached memorandum) would be to insert in a special protocol of accession for Japana provision allowing discriminatory action against Japan in the event of injuryof the kind contemplated by the existing Article XIX of the G.A.T.T.  This solution would permit any member of the Commonwealth to take discriminatory actionagainst imports of a particular product from Japan if these were causing orthreatening to cause serious injury either to local producers or to the exporting interests of other members of the Commonwealth.   other countries would have similar freedom and to the extent they used it, we might benefitindirectly in their markets.   We should have to be prepared to follow the procedures of Article XIX of the G.A.T.T., which would require consultationwith Japan and other Contracting Parties before action unless the urgency ofthe situation called for action before consultation.   The decision whether to takeor continue action would rest with us, but we should have to take into account the risk of retaliatory action by Japan.7. Countries would be free to take action by imposing or threatening toimpose either tariffs or quotas on a discriminatory basis.   While the generalaims of our own commercial policy and, indeed, the underlying philosophy ofthe G.A.T.T. would normally point to the tariff as the appropriate instrument,the way would be open for the use of quantitative restrictions, for example inparticular Colonies, where the tariff might not be appropriate or effective.8. We have arranged for urgent consideration by officials of thepossibility of providing in some way that Japan and the other contracting parties should have no ground for complaint if discriminatory emergency action wastaken by territories to which the Congo Basin Treaties or similar obligationsapply.9.       &quot;We must recognise that it will be very difficult to get general agreement,including that of the Japanese, on this basis.   In particular, the United Statesand Canada are likely to be very nervous of the concept of the use of discriminatory action, which runs counter to the policies which.we and they have
been in the lead in advocating.   If we are to have any chance of success,we shall have to awaken wider realisation of the dangers of admitting japan on a normal basis and assure other countries that it is only against the moreviolent manifestations of Japanese competition that we seek to protectourselves in this way.   To sweeten the pill for the Japanese and to make theproposal more acceptable to the other contracting parties, we should beprepared, if necessary, to agree to review the need for maintaining these provisions after five years.10.  It is implicit in these proposals that we must leave our industries under no misapprehension as to limits of the freedom we should have retained todeal with Japanese competition.   It would be necessary to make it clear to the3that we and other Commonwealth countries could take advantage of thefreedom only in an emergency to meet abnormally intense japanese competition and that short of this they could not look for any artificialprotection beyond that which might be afforded by most^avoured-nationtariffs or Commonwealth preferences.   Otherwise there would be heavy pressure to use the special measures against Japanese goods, when japanese competition became even mildly troublesome to particular industries.11,    If we are to obtain acceptance of our proposals in the Inter sessionalCommittee, we must make early representations to other Governments,especially Commonwealth Governments and the United States Government.We accordingly recommend that we should be authorised to seek a solution on the lines described in paragraph 6 and to enlist the support of othercountries.   If we are unsuccessful, our representatives will need to reserveour position in the Inter sessional Committee,   The line to be taken at the nextplenary session would then need to be reconsidered in the light of the new situation,A.E.P.T.16th January, 1953,
\l0MEMORANDUM1. A Resolution passed at the seventh Session of the G.A.T.T. last Octoberafter &quot;recognising that Japan should take her rightful place in the community of trading nations, and to that end should be admitted to appropriate international arrangements&quot;, provided that -&quot;in order that further consideration may be given to theconditions and timing under which the Japanese application should be pursued, an intersessional committee should make a detailed examination of the matters involved in this application and report on them, the committee being authorised to discuss these matters, as necessary, with Japanese representatives&quot;.This Intersessional Committee will meet on 2nd February to embark upon this task,2.   Procedure for accession to the G.A.T.T.Article XXXIII of the G.A.T.T. provides that a Government notparty to the Agreement may accede to it on terms to be agreed between thatGovernment and the Contracting Parties.   A decision to admit a new memberrequires a two-thirds majority of the Contracting Parties.   The first step is fora country to apply or be invited to enter into tariff negotiations with existing members.   Normally, agreement to accession would turn solely upon the resoltsof these negotiations.   In the case of Japan, her application to enter into tariff negotiations has, primarily on United Kingdom initiative, been made the occasion for raising the question of making accession conditional on special terms whichwould be additional to the normal requirement of mutually satisfactory tariff negotiations.3.   Article XXXVIf an applicant can secure the votes of the requisite two-thirds majorityof the Contracting Parties, and thus becomes a member, and if any other countrieswish to keep themselves free of commitments to the new member, the only course open to them, short of withdrawing from the G.A.T.T., is to avail themselves ofArticle XXXV,   This provides that a contracting party may withhold from anothercontracting party either all the provisions of the Agreement or m. f. n. rates inrespect of goods appearing in negotiated tariff schedules if:-(a) the two contracting parties have not entered intotariff negotiations, and(b) it signifies its unwilling ness to apply the provisions at the timethe other contracting party becomes a member,4,  .        Our attitude to dateUnder the Japanese Peace Treaty, Japan is obliged to extend to eachsignatory m. f. n, treatment for goods if that signatory extends it to her.   this obligation on Japan extends for four years after the ratification of the Treaty,When it lapses the matter becomes subject to individual negotiations.   At present,we extend full m, f. n. treatment to Japan, and she reciprpcates;  but we are under no commitment or obligation to continue such treatment.   Ministers have made thisclear on a number of occasions (see Annex),9  Made in July 1952,
5. The question of assuming m. f. n. obligations to Japan has been precipit-ated, as was bound to happen, by Japan&apos;s application to become a member of theG.A.T.T.  We argued at the seventh Session that, because of our experience of low-cost Japanese competition before the war, her accession presents special problems for us and others which require time for consideration;  and that ifthese problems are not recognised and all countries are obliged to give m, f. n.treatment to Japan, a revival of this competition might force countries to seek toprotect themselves by raising their tariffs and thus bring about a generalintensification of trade barriers.6. The attitude of other countriesThough other contracting parties were willing to support, or atleast acquiesce in the resolution passed at the last Session, few countries haveshown themselves as worried as ourselves about the implications of Japaneseaccession on normal terms.   Our anxieties are strongly shared by Australia,New Zealand and in the main by France;   Canada would probably be satisfied with less far-reaching safeguards than we would think necessary.   The Americans, for political reasons, have been in favour of Japan&apos;s accession.   Other countries have beenneutral or, like the Asiatic Dominions, actively in favour of early accessionon normal terms.7. The Implications of the Seventh Session ResolutionFormally, the Resolution  in no way commits Governments in regardto eventual Japanese accession to the G.A.T.T.   Our position would, however, bea very difficult one if, in the phase which begins with the inter sessional committee meeting in February, the line we took was such as to suggest that we neverseriously thought that any generally acceptable terms could be found which wouldmake Japan&apos;s accession acceptable to us.   We and other hesitant countries must therefore regard ourselves as committed to serious and constructive efforts to find terms upon which we can agree to Japan&apos;s accession.   We would begambling on a very uncertain chance if we proceeded in the hope that when the time-comes Japan would not obtain the two-thirds majority necessary for her admission?&apos;itis thus open to us now to fall back on Article XXXV only if terms acceptable to all parties cannot be found.   Other countries cannot be required to take action against japan against their own interests;  even in our own Colonies, social and political considerations anyway increasingly limit our power to influence their actions,Japan as a member of the G.A.T.T. would have no obligations, for what these may be worth, towards countries which had invoked Article XXXV,   It is therefore probably to our interest to have Japan in the G.A.T.  * on terms which would at least permitall countries to take action so far as they were willing to do so and provide a framework for multilateral discussion of the problems which Japanese competitionmight in future present.8. The nature of Japanese competitionThe reason why Japanese competition was before the war so much moredisruptive than that of any country of comparable size and importance in world tradelay, fundamentally, in the existence of a large and growing population in a country of limited natural resources and her combination of advanced industrialisation witha plentiful supply of labour obliged and, indeed, willing to work hard for low wages.The need to export was intensified by her rearmament drive which had earlyforced a devaluation of the yen;  and ability to exploit her advantages, and, inparticular, to concentrate exports on particular products and in particular marketswas strengthened by the development of a highly efficient and integrated overseasmerchanting organisation backed by powerful combines and trade associations.In some lines, notably textiles, the trade lost to Japan by the older industries was in
part an inevitable result of secular trends;  but the problems of adjustmentwere aggravated by the scope for undercutting to gain additional business in which she was able to indulge in conditions of depression, struggle for markets and special pressures to increase export earnings.9. Since the war the problem has been less evident for a variety of reasons.Japanese industry has not yet fully got back on its feet, nor has the Japaneseeconomy been fully reorientated to the country&apos;s changed economic circumstances.Moreover, because of balance of payments difficulties there are widespread andsevere quantitative restrictions on imports from Japan.   These and other factorsmake it impossible to judge from the present situation what the future may hold.We have, however, to look forward to the time when we and other countries wouldnot be justified in maintaining balance of payments quantitative restrictions or atleast discriminatory balance of payments quantitative restrictions against Japan.10. There have been changes since before the war.   Japan&apos;s membership of the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) should ensure that the rate of exchangebetween the yen and other currencies will correctly reflect the underlying economicrealities.   She has assumed obligations as a member of the International LabourOrganisation (I.L.Q.);  under the Occupation the organisation of labour wasencouraged;  there is a growing awakening of consciousness in respect of hours and conditions of work and levels of wages.   Export prices of certain goods are maintained at world levels;  in this and other ways the Japanese Government has since the war shown willingness to conduct Japan&apos;s external commercial relations in a reasonable and co-operative manner.   The pre-war combines were broken up during the Occupation, though they are beginning to reform and may againpresent a formidable challenge to the individual United Kingdom exporter of limited resources and with relatively inflexible costs.11. The fact remains that Japan is a country with limited natural resources and a large and growing population which has lost important sources of raw materials and large natural export markets on the Chinese mainmland and elsewhere.   Thereis bound to be strong and persistent pressure by her to export more, in particular to the less developed countries, inmcluding our own Colonies, to whom her cheapgoods are of special appeal.   the relatively low-cost structure and the pressure of over-population remains, and the Japanese tradition of austere living will presentopposition to any further rise in wages and may endanger the maintenance of thepresent standards.   We must anyway expect strong competition from Japan over an increasing range of goods;  but there is inherent in the Japanese situation the risk that her competition may again on occasion assume in particular products or marketsthe more violently disruptive forms experienced before the war.   Its effectscould be particularly apparent in the event of recession of world trade and theposition of the Government of the day would be impossible if consistently withremaining a member of the G.A.T.T, it could take no effective action against itsmore extreme manifestations.   In our own approach to the issue we must, inparticular, have regard to the special problem of Lancashire,   It is the belief and hope of important sections of our Lancashire textile industry and of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment that if it can reorganise its methods of production and its system ofmerchanting, it should be able to secure a substantial share of all but the cheapestlines in the markets of the world.   The psychological problem is that theindustry may not be as vigorous as the situation requires in taking the necessary steps over the next two or three years if its confidence in its future is shaken bythe fear that at some future time it may be knocked sideways by what would seemto be unfair Japanese competition,12. Commercial MalpracticesDefinable commercial practices were, even before the war a considerably less important element in the problem, although copying of designs etc. exacerbatedfeeling in industries affected.   We would not want to make Japan*s accession to the
I 2-SG.A.T.T. conditional upon more stringent safeguards against identifiable commercialmalpractices than would arise from her membership of the G.A.T.T., or thanalready exist through her membership of the I.M.F, and her declarations andundertakings in the Peace Treaty.   Japan has never really needed to resort todumping (in the sense of selling for export below the domestic price level),in order to compete with Western producers, but there have been occasions whenJapanese traders have quoted &quot;panic&quot; prices on a falling market.   If we couldprove dumping in such cases we would be entitled under Article VI of the G.A.T.T.to impose countervailing   duties, but proof would be difficult and slow and we couldnot count on being able to use this safeguard.13.    The nature of the solution we should seekThere can be no adequate safeguard merely in making Japan*s accessionconditional upon declarations to observe fair labour practices or the like, such asthe U.S.A. are understood to have in mind.   These already exist in the Preamble tothe Peace Treaty for what they may be worth.   It would be impracticable and dangerous to attempt any definition in terms of relative wage levels.   The Americansmight be tempted to compare United Kingdom and american wages, and it would arouse the opposition of other low-wage countries.14.   The need for freedom to discriminate against JapanFreedom to discriminate against Japan is essential.   In negotiatingexisting tariff commitments neither we nor other countries have, in general, hadthe problem of Japanese competition in mind;  and it has been a main plank inour case against the admission of Japan on a normal basis that if other countries were bound by m. f. n. obligations to Japan, the need to take action against japanese competition would lead to an unravelling of tariff commitments and a generalraising of tariff barriers.   So long as we are bound by the &quot;ncrn3w- preference&quot;rule and wish to maintain free entry for Commonwealth goods we are precluded from any effective use of any of the various tariff techniques which enable aheavier burden of duty to be imposed on very cheap goods than on the normal run of imports.   Freedom from the &quot;no new preference&quot; rule, if we can secure it,would give us some room for manoeuvre, but the rule would still inhibit other commonwealth countries from raising the m, f. n. rate while leaving the preferential rates untouched, and there would still be limitations on our own ability to deal effectively with low-price Japanese competition by tariff adjustment on an m, f. n.basis.   There is often considerable practical difficulty - particularly in the caseof goods which are supplied in a wide range of designs and qualities - in so fixingspecific or alternative duties thafthey bear hardly on the goods which it is desired to check without damaging imports from other countries whose trade wedo not wish to harm;  and any duties which are specifically related to the price ofgoods are liable to need more frequent revision in the light of fluctuations in price.Moreover these considerations might well make it difficult and costly to securethe necessary freedom from the contracting parties concerned to deal with japanese imports in the case of duties already bound under the G.A.T.T, A very wide range of goods (estimated at about 60 per cent by value of our imports) is covered by specific G.A.T.T, commitments;  and the list includes a number of itemson which the problem of acute Japanese competition might arise, e, g. all the major textiles, many types of apparel, sports goods, toys and fancy goods.  Anadditional reason for suggesting that we should seek freedom to discriminate against Japan is that certain other existing members of the G.A.T.T. couldlegitimately object to the granting of special powers to deal with low costcompetition (irrespective of the source),15,   The circumstances justifying use of this freedomIt is clearly difficult to envisage acceptance of any solution which doesnot recognise Japan&apos;s need to export or which seems to imply that it is our aim to perpetuate a particular pattern of trade in favour of our industries either at home-4-
or in export markets in face of no more than normal and &quot;fair&quot; competition.The most we could hope to obtain would be freedom to take &quot;emergency&quot;action to deal with an intensification of Japanese competition in particular goodsor particular localities on a scale causing or threatening serious injury to our industries or their exports to third markets.16. It would be essential to resist any attempt to lay down in advance the degree of intensification of competition or of consequent injury which would constitute an emergency.   Governments must be free to take action unilaterallywhen and to the extent they judge it necessary, though we should clearly have to beprepared to justify our action subsequently.   It must be recognised that it isimplicit in this concept that Governments would not be justified in using thefreedom to erect barriers for the protection of their industries unless they were seriously threatened by an abnormal intensification of Japanese competition.It would be essential for Governments to be ready to make it clear to their industries that they would take advantage of the freedom only in emergency and that, short of this, industries could not look for any artificial protectionbeyond that which might be accorded by m. f. n. tariff rates or Commonwealthpreferences.   Otherwise there would be heavy pressure to invoke special measures against Japanese goods, whenever Japanese competition became evenmildly troublesome to particular industries,17,       Suggested terms for Japanese AccessionThe freedom we should thus want to seek is in effect an extension, tobe applicable only to Japan, of the existing provisions of Article XIX of the G.A.T.T.for emergency action on imports of particular products.   This is the Article towhich the United States Government are under pressure to have resort when thetariff reductions they have made hurt their industries, and it is essential that weshould continue to be able to maintain that it should be used as sparingly as possible.It is inadequate for the purpose we have in mind, both because it does not allowdiscriminatory action and because it limits freedom of action in the Colonies to cases of serious and unforeseen injury to our exporting industries resulting fromreductions of preferences.   Our needs would,however, be met if it could be provided in the Japanese Protocol of Accession that there could be resort to discriminatoryaction against Japan along the lines envisaged in Article XIX not only if importsfrom Japan caused or threatened to cause serious injury to the domestic industries of a contracting party, but also if these caused or threatened to cause serious injury to the exports of a contracting party to territories in the area within whichpreferential arrangements are permitted under the G.A.T.T. even although nopreference were in operation oh the particular product or in the particular marketconcerned.   This formula would not allow us to take action in respect of imports into the United Kingdom to help (say) a French industry which was suffering fromJapanese competition in our market;  but it would lead to  undesirable pressuresif the formula were so widely drawn.   It would, however, give, in addition to thefreedom we want as regards imports into the United Kingdom, freedom for othermembers of the Commonwealth, including the Colonies, to take such action asthey might be willing to take in tho interests of United Kingdom exports.   before taking action we should be required to consult Japan and the other contractingparties, unless the urgency of the situation required, in our view, action beforeconsultation.   The decision to take and continue action would rest with commonwealth governments.   If, however, we acted without prior consultation or, if, in the eventof consultations failing to lead to a settlement, we decided to continue action, itwould be open to the Japanese to take counter &quot;action.   This is a risk we cannotavoid,18.   The Special Position of the Congo Basin Territories.There would be an important limitation on the area within which we could,if necessary, use the special emergency provision, if we could not use it in
territories covered by the Congo Basin Treaties; and it is suggested that we should examine urgently the possibility of providing in some way in the Japanese protocol of Accession to the G.A,T,T. that freedom to use the special emergency provisions should not be so limited.19.   The Form of Protective ActionIt is the general aim of our own commercial policy, and indeed the basic philosophy of the G.A.T.T. that the tariff is the proper instrument for protection.   It has always been our aim to circumscribe as narrowly as possiblethe circumstances in which quantitative restrictions may be used for protective purposes.   Some of our Colonies have local industries and we have encouragedthem to look to the tariff for such protection as these may need.   We should thusregard tariff action as the proper form in which to take emergency action bothin the United Kingdom and elsewhere.   There is, however, the possibility that inthe circumstances of some Colonies tariff action might be difficult to take or makesufficiently effective.   The form in which we would seek to get the emergency provisions laid down would leave it open to countries to decide whether to take action by tariffs or quotas,20. It will be no easy task to secure the agreement of the majority of theother contracting parties and the Japanese to a solution on these lines.   It must berecognised that the concept of discrimination, however special and limited thecircumstances in which it would be used, runs counter to the whole philosophyunderlying our own general commercial policies and the G.A.T.T,  The americans and Canadians in particular will undoubtedly seize on this point, both on general grounds and because it may open the door to pressures for similar powers fordiscriminatory action against other countries, including ourselves.   Our chance ofsuccess will be influenced by:-(a) the extent to which we can get other countries to recognise moreforcibly the dangers we see for the wliole structure of existingtariff commitments in admission of Japan to the G.A.T.T. on a normal basis;(b) our ability to convince the Japanese and others that what we are seeking is freedom to take action only in an emergency.If it would help to secure Japanese acceptance, we could, if necessary, considerproviding for review of the need-for continuation of the freedom after an initial period of five years.21. If we are successful in getting agreement in the Inter sessional Committeeto provisions on these lines, it would be essential, when it comes to the fullmeeting of the Contracting Parties, to get it established that there can be nogoing back on these terms when the final decision on Japanese accession comes tobe taken after the tariff negotiations.   It would also be necessary to make it quite clear to the Japanese and others that our willingness to agree, when the time came,to Japanese accession on these terms  was without prejudice to any desiderata we might wish to put forward in relation to our own or the Japanese tariff in tariff negotiations with her prior to her accession.   In this connection, we should continueto press our view that because of the importance of Japan in world trade, the tariff negotiations preliminary to her accession should take place as part of a majormultilateral tariff conference,22. If we are unable in the Inter sessional Committee to secure agreement to recommendations on the lines suggested in this paper for consideration by the contracting Parties at their next full session, it will be necessary for our representatives to reserve the United Kingdom position.   The line we should then take at the full meeting of the Contracting Parties would need to be considered afres]nearer the time, in the light of the discussions in the Intersessional Committeeand all the relevant factors,
annex. In answer to a Parliamentary Question from Mr. Anthony Greenwood on the19th March, 1951, the then President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Harold Wilson,;included in his reply the following sentences:-&quot;His Majesty&apos;s Government have carefully considered whether theycould take the step of entering into a formal undertaking. .... to extendm. f. n. treatment to Japan, and they have decided that in all thecircumstances they should not enter into such an obligation......H.M.Government will continue to accord to Japanese goods thebenefit of the m. f. n. tariff, but it would be unwise for us to tie our hands in any way until the future course of the Japanese economy and of japanese commercial policies have become more clearly established. &quot;-7-23.   Summary(i)    in the phase of the work opening with the Intersessional committee meeting in February we must be prepared to make serious and constructive efforts to formulate terms upon which we could agreeto Japan&apos;s accession to the G.A.T.T.;(ii) nothing we  can get written into the terms of accession can requireother countries to limit imports of Japanese goods which they want in their own interests;  even if we retain complete freedom,our power to influence the action of our Colonies is becoming increasingly limited;(iii) it is of the essence of the problem that we should have freedom totake discriminatory action against Japan;(iv) the most it would be reasonable or practicable to seek is freedomwhich would permit ourselves and the Commonwealth to take&quot;emergency&quot; action to deal with an intensification of japanese competition which was causing or threatening to cause serious injury to domestic production or exports from anotherCommonwealth country;(v) what we should aim to get would in effect be an extensionapplicable only to Japan and written into the Japanese protocol of Accession, of the provisions of the existing emergency escapeclause of the G.A.T.T.;(vi) while the decision to take or continue action would rest entirely with us, we should have to justify it internationally and could notavoid the risk of Japanese counter-action;(vii) while the appropriate form of action would normally be throughthe tariff, the provisions we would seek would not exclude quotaaction when tariff action might be inappropriate and ineffective;(viii) it is important to recognise that provisions along these lines would limit the circumstances in which action could be taken toprotect our industries by reason both of the need to confineaction to an &quot;emergency&quot; and of the need to justify the actionin the consultation with the other contracting parties includingJapan either before or after the action is taken.
2. In a supplementary reply to a Parliamentary Question byMr. Assheton on 26th July, 1951, the then President of the Board of Trade,Sir Hartley Shawcross, said,&quot;We have made it quite clear that we can give no undertaking to extend m. f. n. treatment to Japan in the future. &quot;3. At the opening of the Geneva Session of the Contracting parties on 19th September, 1951, the then President of the Board of Trade,Sir Hartley Shawcross, said that if Japan applied for full membership ofthe G.A.T.T. Britain would have seriously to consider whether she couldextend to her obligations already extended to the original members.   he went on to say that the question of Japan being admitted as a member of theG.- A.T.T. had not yet arisen, and &quot;at present, we have no intention of granting her m, f. n. rights&quot;,4. On 26th November, 1951, on winding up the Debate on the secondreading of the Japanese Treaty of Peace Bill, the President of the Board ofTrade (Mr. Thorneycroft) made the following statement:-&quot;I was asked., . , what our attitude would be about m. f. n.treatment.   My answer is that today we extend m. f. n. treatment to Japan, but we are under no obligation to do so under theTreaty that we have signed, nor will we tie ourselves to do sobecause it would? in these circumstances, be unwise, with thefuture as uncertain as it is.   The truth is - and I would say this to those who attack us - that this country is free toimpose quotas, to put on tariffs or to discriminate against japanese trade coming into this Island. &quot;
