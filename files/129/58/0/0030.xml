Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953SECRET   vfiK ; ,0: Copy No.C. (53) 30 :28th January, 1953CABINETPROPOSED ENQUIRY INTO THE COST OF THE national health service memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the cost of the Health Service has been growing steadily since its creationin 1948:- &quot; v.,   millions1948-49 (9 months)    ................ 20.1 (net expenditure)1949-50 .................. 345 ( ,,                )      ,1950-51  ...............      ... 377 ( ,,         ,,       )1951-52 ...      ...      .........      ... 391 ( ,,                 )1952-53 ......      ............ 411 (revised net estimated1953-54 ...      ...      ...      .......... 418 (net estimate)t2. As my colleagues will recognise, it will not be at all easy for me to find asum of the order of  418 millions for the Health Service next year, and the estimatehas only been kept down to that sum by severe pruning and by requiring hospital authorities to draw upon their reserves of stores and cash to the extent of severalmillions. It is largely for that reason that in agreement with the Minister of health i am proposing that the II- prescription charge should in future apply to eachprescription, and not to each prescription form (however many prescriptions it contains), saving some  6 millions in a full year. But my main concern centresround the fact that there seems to be no reason at all why the cost of the health service should not go on increasing year after year for a long time to come.Admittedly the increase so far to a large extent- reflects the general rises in prices and wages (since July 1948 when the Service began the interim retail price indexhas gone up by 25 per cent, and the wage index by 28 per cent.). Even apart fromthis, however, I can see no limit to what could be spent on it with some,show ofjustification if the money and the resources were forthcoming. Many of the exist-ing buildings are undoubtedly out of date and not well adapted to new methodsof treatment. Additional beds are needed, particularly for mental patients. new and expensive drugs are continually being discovered, and new techniques developedwhich may involve the use of complicated and costly apparatus. The individualpatienfs financial position is no longer a limiting factor in doctor&apos;s minds sincethe Exchequer now pays the bill and it seems to be assumed in some quarters that;the sky is the limit. We could not possibly tell the medical profession or thehospital authorities that their standards are too high. That may well be true, butit would not be the whole story and would, moreover, be taken as implying thatHealth Service patients must be satisfied with something less than the best orsomething less than some doctors think the best and that might spell the beginningof the end of the Service.3. The previous Government tried to solve this problem by imposing an arbitrary ceiling of  400 millions as the limit of what the Exchequer could afford to spend a year on the Health Service.  Above that ceiling the cost was in effect* Includes the Danckwerts Award to the doctors, but excludes arrears of  26 millions,t Excludes  6 millions saving from the proposed revision of the 1 /- prescription charge.43609
Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,28th January, 1953.met by the patient in the form of charges for dentures and so on. In an attempt tokeep broadly within t&apos;hat:ceiling this year,-further charges; e.g., the Is. prescriptioncharge, were introduced. In my view this expedient has gone as far as it can go,at any rate for the time being. Apart from the welcome proposal to change theform of the prescription charge, there are no obvious services left for which the patient could justifiably be asked to pay and which would produce any substantialrevenue. Nor, I think, could we increase the amounts of the present charges;-whichare already high. In any case any new charges would present considerable political difficulty.4. I feel sure that a solution to the problem cannot be found in arbitrarypercentage cuts which, in the Hospital Service, for example, would penalise thoseBoards and Committees with a good record for past economy and would put apremium on past extravagance. Nor are there any obvious opportunities forfurther economy. Economies have been, and will, I hope, continue to be made,but there comes a point when further savings on any scale are impossible withoutdefinite reductions in the services provided, and that in the last resort means closinghospital beds and dismissing nurses with all the political problems which such acourse would involve.5. It seems to me essential to relate the present and prospective cost of the health Service to the other claims on the national economy. In my opinion noChancellor could view without grave misgivings the prospect that expenditure onthe Health Service will go on increasing for years to come. After discussion withthe Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health, I propose thatthe Government should appoint a Committee to advise them on this difficult problem. We have in mind a small independent Committee of four or five membersof acknowledged ability and standing and we suggest that their Terms of reference should be as follows:  &quot; To review the present and prospective cost of the National health service having regard to the other claims on the national economy; to suggestmeans, whether by modifications in organisation or otherwise, of ensuring the most effective control and efficient use of such Exchequer funds as may be: made available; to advise how -a continually rising Exchequer charge can be. , avoided, while providing for the maintenance of the Service and its reasonabledevelopment, and to make recommendations.&quot;&quot; 6. : If my colleagues agree with this proposal, I suggest that the Secretary ofState for Scotland, the Minister of Health and I should be left to settle the member-ship of the Committee.s;.
