(.5th January, 1953.CABINET
(a)Text of a telegram from the United Sfat.es AmbaasadQ Tehran to the State Department reporting a furtherconversation with Dr. Musaddici on 51st December !j.9.52I requested another interview this morning with Musaddiq.Our conversation again lasted nearly 3 hours.   He- was obviouslyill and his physical condition added sane what to my difficulties.2.     I first discussed with him technical difficulties rearbitral procedure which would be encountered in proceedings before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) if he continuedto insist that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) be other party to arbitration.   I showed him copy statute of ICJ providing that only states may be parties to proceedings before court.   I told him matter had not as yet been discussed with BritishGovernment which had hitherto insisted that it rather thanAIOC be other party to arbitration.   I then suggested 2 alter-natives listed as (a) and (b) in reference telegram.3.     Musaddiq said he quite aware Article 34 of Charter provided&apos;&quot;only states may be parties in cases before the court.&quot;   He had never contemplated that formal juridicial case be presented to court.   His idea was that justices who were members of ICJ couldform an arbitration panel composed of themselves and that thispanel as board of arbitration rather than as court would considerquestion compensation.   He hoped that court as contribution to international comity would not object to its justices formingboard of arbitration.   In response to my question he said thatall justices should be offered opportunity to sit on panel but.that if any of them did not desire to do so remaining justiceswould be considered as full panel.   If ICJ found some techincal or other objection, to permitting its justices to act in suchacpacity? his alternative suggestion would be that Mr. McNair,British justice, and Mr. Sanjabi, Iranian justice, should form nucleus of an arbitration board of 3 and that they would agree upon third member.-  He said that he would prefere arbitralagreement be signed by AIOC but he would not seriously objectif British Government would sign agreement in capacity of.representative of AIOC.   I asked whether it would not bepossible for British Government to appear before ICJ itself incapacity of government acting as representative ofone of its nationals.   He replied he considered 2 alternatives
i&apos;4which tie had suggested to be fair and did not care contemplateother alternatives.   In order that his position mightbe clear he would write down what he had in mind.   Hethereupon scribbled number of sentences in his notebookin Persian which he permitted Saleh, my Iranian assistant,to copy.   Translation of what he wrote is as follows:&quot;Either all the judges of the International Court of Justicewho are members of the court at the time of the signing ofthe agreement are appointed as arbitrators, or only the2 judges who were members of the court when the Anglo-Iranian case was heard, namely McNair and Dr. Sanjabi, tobe appointed by both parties as arbitrators.   These 2arbitrators will appoint a joint arbitrator.The agreement may be signed by the British Governmentrepresenting the company.In case McNair should be the president of the ICJ and heshould preside over this arbitral tribunal Iranian government would have no objection, and it would even beprepared to give up the idea of sending it special judgewho had been appointed at the time the Anglo-Iranian case was before the ICJ,As soon as the arbitral agreement is signed the AmericanGovernment or any American firm shall pay 0100 millions andshall purchase oil afterwards until such time as itsaccount is settled,   In the event Iran should be found by the arbitral tribunal to be owing the former company,Iran shall pay 25 per cent of the proceeds of oil thatshe would sell abroad every year until this debt is entirely paid off.If any member of the ICJ, who should be a member at thetime of the signing&apos; of &quot;the arbitral agreement, should leave the court, it will .still be he himself who shall act as arbitrator, not his successor.These conversations shall not be valid until they havebeen approved by the Majlis&quot;.4.   After I had read what Prime. Minister had written I saidI would like to raise several points.   In first place it seemed to me unwise to state in arbitral agreement howsuch compensation as may be found due was to be said.   Mightnot it be bettor to allow arbitration panel to determine methodof payment? Musaddiq. replied vigorously in negative. He said mannerpayment must be within framework nationalisation law and that
should be understood in early stage of negotiations.He said he was willing as alternative to agree that compensation be paid in oil valued at &quot;gulf&quot;.prices tobe delivered in 5 annual instalments.   It is my under-standing that he meant Persian Gulf prices although duringour conversation he made one reference to &quot;Gulf of Mexico&quot;prices,   I told him I thought it would serve no purpose tosuggest that compensation be paid with oil valued at Gulfpricesbecause neither AIOC nor any other large company would be willing purchase oil at those prices without heavydiscounts and that by placing such high&apos; value on oildelivered as compensation Iran would be cutting downmaterially amount of compensation.   He said that in that case he would allow 25 per cent clause to stand.5,    I then pointed out that his formula had made no reference to conclusion of purchase contract with some oil company such as subsidiary AlOC or national companyincluding AIOC which would assure Iran minimum amount of annual oil sales over fixed term of years.   Prime ministers aid he had been giving this natter deep thought and had decided he did not wish to commit himself at this time toenter into negotiations with. AIOC for sale of Iranian oil.After compensation problem had been disposed of by reference to arbitration and after he had received0100 millions from United States Government for oil to be delivered in accordance with terms to be agreed upon between government of Iran and Government of United States, eitherdirect or through some company, he would then decidethrough what channels Iran would dispose of it-s-oil exports,I was somewhat taken aback at this statement,   l said that although during our previous conversation he had not.,definitely agreed to enter into negotiations with  AIOCor some subsidiary of AIOC he nevertheless had seemed tobe in general agreement with. United States suggestions for disposal Iranian oil as outlined by me.   On various occasions he had told me that if arbitration question wasonce disposed of tie would have no objection to entering into negotiations with AIOC direct for sale of Iranian oilprovided it was understood that such negotiations would not mean that AIOC be given monopoly,   Was I to understandthat he had now changed his mind?   Musaddiq replied he nowfeared it might be dangerous to trust AIOC to purchasebulk of Iranian oil.   There danger that United Kingdom inorder bring pressure on Iran might at some time or othercause AIOC cease purchasing Iranian oil with disastrousresults for Iran,   If AIOC would be willing to deposit0200 millions in some neutral place which would be forfeit ifit shouldcontract with Iran Government
he would consider selling any amount to AIOC.   I told him that if AIOC entered into contract with him it would of course be liable for damages for breach thereof.   NeitherAIOG nor any other company would be willing to allow320Q millions to remain idle merely so it serve asguarantee fulfilment of contract.   Such transaction unprecedent-dented in international foreign trade.   If United Kingdomand United States should agree   to refer Question ofcompensation to arbitration they also would have no guarantee that Iran would abide by decision of arbitrationpanel.   They would have to trust Iran&apos;s good faith.Similarly Iran must place some trust in good faith ofUnited Kingdom if satisfactory sale contract for iranian oil was to be negotiated.   Prime Minister said he couldnot promise at this time to enter into negotiations withAIOG or any other company.   I asked him if United kingdom in good faith and with good will should agree to termsof arbitration along lines suggested by him would his attitude towards AI00 be likely to change in this respect.He said he could not make any promises at this time.   Hewould see how situation looked after compensationagreement had been entered into, consisting of (a) com-pensation, (b) sale of Iranian oil, (c) Iran to continue as master of its own oil industry, and (d) payment inadvance of 3100 millions on oil to be purchased by united States in order to enable Iranian Government meet its current urgent needs.   These four points were related to one another.   I said that in contemplating advance of3100&apos; millions United States Government was prompted bydesire to see oil dispute between United Kingdom and Iransettled and to see Iran once more selling oil in foreign&quot;markets in sufficient quantities to enable it to meet itsbudgetary and other needs.   Iran by refusing simultaneouslytake steps to assure sale of its oil abroad was distortingprogram which United States Government had in mind.   PrimeMinister said it seemed to him United States Governmentwas worrying too much re future welfare Iran.   What Iranneeded now was 3100 millions and with that it could carryon until it could work out arrangements for substantialsales oil.   He di d not,.believe AIOG really wanted buyIranian oil.   If it did, Iran would be glad to sell it-oil on same terms as it would any other foreign company.He did not at this time wish however to take any actionor give any promise which, might place AIOC in favoredposition.   I pointed out that by force of circumstancesAIOC was already in favored position as purchases. Italone of all oil companies of world already had at itsdisposed transport and marketing facilities for handlinglarge quantities Iranian oil.   It could also sell oil in sterling countries which did not have funds to purchasedillar oil.   Mosaddiq continued to insist that at this juncture he would give no commitment re entering into longterm sales contract with AIOC or AIOC subsidiary.   Hesaid he hoped United States Government would not try bring pressure on Iran to sell oil to AIOC by refusing otherwiseto buy from Iran 3100 millions worth of oil upon conclusionof arbitration agreement.
177. (sic)   i told naosaddiq that it was with great reluct-ance that I was presenting his present attitude to my government.   For mo to do so would strengthen argumentsthose groups in United States and United Kingdom who&apos; -maintained that he changed his mind so frequently itwas almost impossible to deal with him.   Furthermore,his attitude would make it more difficult for Britishto make concessions which would be necessary if his idea re terms of reference for arbitration would beaccepted by therm   His attitude, I felt, would prolongnegotiations.   I hoped that he would think matter overand change his mind again before our next conversation,this time in helpful way.   it seemed to me that he hadtaken a constructive attitude re arbitration and I hopedhe would do same re sale of oil.   He should understandthat I was not pressing him in interest of AIOC.   AI.OCcould do nicely without Iranian oil.   My concern was for Iran which should sell at least 20 million tons ayear if it was to enjoy real prosperity.8.     Mosaddiq said he was afraid in any event considerable time would elapse before an agreement could be made reoil.   Perhaps United States Government in order tide Iranover this period sell Iran 120,000 tons of sugar on credit which would be repaid later in form of oil orproceeds from oil.   Iran used 200,000 tons of sugarannually; it produced 80,000 tons; its import needs were120,000 tons.   With this importation of sugar Iran couldcarry on for a month or two until oil question couldbe solved.   British would not be so much off ended ifUnited States would assist Iran in this way as they wouldbe if United States would make direct financial loans.9. I said that although I doubted that my Governmentcould enter into a transaction this kind, I would passalong his suggestion. So far as British Government.- was concerned it knew enough about financial matters to beable understand that United States sale of this amountof sugar on credit to Iran was tantamount to givingbudgetary assistance.

&quot;Elements ofthe Proposal of the United States Marketingwith an Annex   (Draft Arbitration Agreement)Council Inc.I. ContractThe United States Marketing Council has a signedcontract with the Iranian Government which provides:A. The United States Marketing Council (USMC) is to buy 12 million tons (8 million products, k millioncrude) of oil per annum for a period of ten shears,beginning 1 st January,^ 1953.     If Iranian, productionincreases more than 25 per cent above presentcapacity (i.e. capacity as the plant and organisationnow stand, estimated by Musaddiq at about 15 million tons per annum), the company is obligated to buy60 per cent of the excess at the contract price, butthe &apos; NIOC       is not obligated to sell this excess.B. Price of crude is to be the current price at pipelinehead at Sidon, as of the day of loading, less 30 percent.    (This is said to work out at about $9,15 perton, based on today&apos;s prices.)    Price of products isto be the current Gulf of Mexico price as of the dayof loading, less 35 per cent discount.C. USMC    .  is to advance $50 million to the Iranian government.   $2.5 million will be paid off out of thefirst oil. deliveries, but the remaining $25 million will not be repaid until the end of the contractperiod.D. USMC       will act as agent (but not exclusive agent\for the . NICO       in procuring technical assistance,equipment, etc. needed for the operation of the oil industry.     USMC.      will receive a fee of 10 per cent for this service.B.     As soon as the $50 million advance is deposited inthe National City Bank, Dr. Musaddiq will submit the contract to the Majlis for ratification. Both stepsmust be completed by 12th January.F. USMC       is obligated to move the first 100,000 tonsof oil by May.G. The contract may be terminated by either party atthe end of five years.II. Background:tAccording to USMC&apos;s negotiator, Marcus, thenegotiations were conducted in great secrecy and are stillknown to very few people.   No announcement is to be made until the contract is submitted to the Majlis.The USMC wanted the right to buy 60 per cent of totalIranian production, plus whatever quantity of the remainingho per cent the Iranians could not sell to others.Musaddiq refused on the ground he could not give so large a share of production to any one company.    The figure of memorandum prepared in the State Department entitled:
4/912 million tons was agreed upon because it is only aboutkO per cent of production at&apos;the 1950 rate and can thus be defended to the Iranian public:    even though.it isaround 80 per cent of present production capacity.    TheIranians wanted to keep down both the quantity of oiland the duration of the contract, so as to have their hands free to develop markets of their own.The USMO refused to tell Musa&amp;diq what companies it represented or where it would market the oil.    Marcus didtell him,, however,  that USMO might make some arrangements with AI0G.    Musa&amp;diq replied that he di&amp;n&apos;t care what thecompany did in this regard, so long as the Iranian government didnft have to have dealings with AI0C.Marcus told Musa&amp;diq that he was in Iran with theknowledge of the American Government and that he would report to the State Department on his return.    AtMusaddiq&apos;s request, however, he did not inform the embassy in Tehran of his activities.The USMG has notified the AI00 that it has signeda contract and has intimated that it would be willing tomake a deal with ATOC, but the latter company has been completely unresponsive.,   USMG claims it would be happy to talk to AIOC either in London or New York.    It does not &quot;want to begin operations without an understanding withAIOC.The USMG appears to be a very small outfit having no connection with the oil business and probably having verylittle capital.III.    Plan for Settlement of Compensation Question;According to Marcus, Dr. Musa&amp;diq has promised that once the contract is ratified and in effect he, Musa&amp;diq,will take the initiative in making a new proposal for settlement of the compensation question.    He will drop hisdemand for payment of the  1+9 millions and offer to enterinto direct negotiations or, alternatively to submit thequestion to arbitration under a formula which would allow the court to consider possible future profits in determining the extent of the damages awarded.    Thearbitral agreement would provide that Iran was free tosell oil to anyone.
2\ANNEXARBITRATION AGREEMENTWhereas, it appears that differences of opinion as well asrights and obligations have arisen &quot;between the Iranian governmentand the A.1.0.C. with relation to certain oil concessions, andWhereas5  the Iranian government has nationalized its oil industry in its own interest and lias caused to be created agovernmental agency i.e. N.I.O.C. , andWhereas, THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE AT THE HAGUEhas decided that it has no right (a) to question the right ofthe Iranian government to nationalize its oil industry and (b)to compel compulsorily the Iranian government to submit the issues herein to arbitration without its voluntary consent andWhereas the A. 1.0. C.  has asserted its right to stop the iranian government from converting the crude and refined products to cash andWhereas,  the disputing parties have by their irreconcilablepositions imperiled the security of peace in the world, andWhereas, both parties fully recognizing that due process oflaw requires the submission of the issues to the full and impartial Court of Arbitration for final adjudication, it isNOW, mutually agreed between the Iranian government and theA. 1.0. C.  in the interest of world peace, due process of law and justice between the parties, as follows:(l)   That pending the arbitration proceedings and the finalaward of the Court of International Justice at the Hague, that :the N.I.O.C. shall be empowered, directed upon the signing ofthis agreement to sell its crude oil and oil products now in itspossession in Iran or elsewhere in markets which will be hereafterdeveloped by it, free and clear of any and all claims and liensby A.I.O.C.  against it, however, it being understood that theclaims and liens of whatsoever nature and description by A.1.0.C.will attach to proceeds of sale to the extent of 25 per cent andshall be held in special account by a trustee bank nominated bythe Secretary of State of the United States of America, and whichtrustee funds shall be&quot; invested in United States Treasury bonds .paying at least 2 per cent interest and which fund shall be thefund out of which the judgment of the Court of Arbitration shallbe satisfied.The issues limited for decision shall be;(a) Jurisdiction is hereby conferred uoon the international court OP JUSTICE at the Hague in full panel.(b) To hear and determine without limitation whatsoever any and all claims, counter claims by each against the other 1    the iranian government versus A.I.O.C. and the Court shall upon suchproof and evidence submitted to it fix and award beyond appeal   .and conclusive upon the parties.(c) The Court is hereby empowered upon proper applicationto it, to issue its subpoena to compel the production of any andall documents, data, letters etc. which either party deemsnecessary in its submission of proof of its claims and. neitherparty may refuse to obey the said subpoena because of privilegeor confidential status.The foregoing agreement is entered into between the partiesvoluntarily and of their own free will and accord.-9-
(a)Memorandum from Mr.  Byroade of the United. States State Departmentto Sir P. Dixon dated 3rd January. 195^I have extracted from cables which arrived, this morning the attachments which I believe will be of interest to you.The first two papers are draft suggestions by the department as to how the arbitration agreements might be phrased.    Thesedo not appear to me entirely consistent with latest developments and were not drafted on the basis that the British would have ;the choice of nationalisation law which was selected.    If itproves that Musaddiq would agree to this method, appropriatechanges would need to be made in Article 2B of Alternative Aand Article 3B of Alternative B,Following our discussions the other evening, I put threespecific questions to the Department.    They are also attached tothe answers I received this morning.Annex (1,),ALTERNATIVE (a) - United Kingdom-Iran Agreement&quot;The Government of Iran and the Government of the UnitedKingdom, being desirous of effecting a settlement of differences which have arisen in respect of the AIOC, a corporationorganized in and under the laws of the United Kingdom, haveagreed upon the following Articles;Article 1,The two Governments,  in conformity with the provisionsof the statute of the International Court of Justice, refer tothe Court for consideration and final determination, inacoordance with the principles of international law,  justice and equity, the matter of the amount of compensation payable to the AIOC on account of its pecuniary claims arising as a consequence of acts taken in respect of its properties and rights in Iran by the Government of Iran pursuant to the iranian Oil Nationalization Aot of 1st May, 1951.Article in making the determination provided for in Article 1 ofthis agreement, the Court shall;(A) Take into account such counter-claims as theGovernment of Iran may assert against the AIOC;(B) Take into account any of the various methods ofevaluation which have been utilized by states todetermine compensation for nationalizedenterprises which the court may consider to bein accord with the principles of InternationalLaw,  justice and equity; and(c)    Not take into account the general rule ofInternational Law and practice requiring, asa condition precedent to the validity orallowance of a claim, the exhaustion of localremedies available under municipal law.
Article gIt is recognized that on and after the effective date ofthis agreement the NIOC is empowered to sell crude oil and oil products now in its possession, or which may be producedor processed by it in the future in Iran or elsewhere, free and clear of any and all claims or liens by the AIOG.    It isalso agreed that 25 per cent of the gross proceeds of the saleof oil and oil products by the NIOO shall be deposited in a trust account in a financial institution to be agreed upon bythe parties hereto.    If within a period of 30 days after the effective date of this agreement the parties are unable to soagree upon the financial institution the financial institutionmay be designated by the International Court of Justice.   the funds so deposited shall be utilized to pay such compensation as the Court may award the AIOC pursuant&quot; to the provisions ofthis agreement.&quot;ALTERNATIVE ,(B) - instance - Iran AgreementArticle^&quot;The Government of Iran and the instance agree that theclaims of the instance arising as a consequence&quot;&quot;of thenationalization of the instance in Iran, pursuant to the iranian oil Nationalization Act of 1st May, 1951, shall be submittedto an arbitral tribunal constituted in accordance with theprovisions of Article 2 of the Agreement.Article 2(A) The tribunal shall consist of 3 members to be designated by International Court of Justice.(B) The decision of the majority of the members of thetribunal shall be accepted as final and binding.In the case of the death or resignation of a member,his successor shall be designated in the mannerprescribed in paragraph (a) of the article,(O)    The tribunal may prescribe such rules of procedure as may be necessary to enable it to carry out its functions.(D)    The compensation of the members of the tribunalshall&apos; be fixed by the ICJ.    The ^compensation ofthe members of the tribunal and its expensesshall be shared equally by the Government of Iran and the instance.Article(A) The tribunal shall determine in accordance with theprinciples of international law,   justice and equitythe amount of compensation due as a result of thenationalization of the instance referred to inArticle 1  of this agreement and as a result of thevarious counter claims which the Government of Iranhas indicated it will advance against the instance.(B) In determining the amount of compensation due under paragraph (A) of this Article,  the tribunal shall take into account any of the various methods of valuation which have been used by states todetermine compensation for nationalized industries which the tribunal considers to be appropriate,fair and equitable.
(0)    Since it is the desire of the parties to effect anexpeditious determination of the claimsencompassed by the agreement, it is agreedthat no such claims shall be disallowed orrejected by the application of the general rule of international law that local remedies must be exhausted as a condition precedent to the validityor allowance of a claim.Article jj.After the signing of this agreement, it is recognised thatthe NIOG shall be expowered to sell the crude oil and oilproducts now in its possession or which will -be developed by it in the future in Iran or elsewhere free and clear of any and all claims or liens by the AIOG against it.    It is agreed,however, that 25 per cent of the gross proceeds of the saleof oil by the NIOC shall be deposited in a trustee banknominated by the parties hereto, or if they cannot agree within30 days after the coming into force of this agreement, by theIOJ, where it shall be available to satisfy the award of thetribunal established under Article 2 of this agreement.&quot;Annex (2)memorandum I would appreciate Department&apos;s and Tehran&apos;s urgentcomments on foregoing, particularly on following points:(A) Any further indications which Henderson may have asresult of his conversations which might indicate whetherMusaddiq has in mind that Court or two parties in agreement should determine nationalization law to be applied by Court.Departments reply:As to point A, ... (Tehran) ... clearly itidicates thatMusaddiq at one point in the conversation was quite preparedto agree that AIOC could choose which nationalization lawit considered as being most favourable to it.We doubt whether Musaddiq&apos;s subsequent reference todecision by ICJ as to lav/ to be used as basis for determiningamount of compensation should be taken as a firm change inMusaddiq&apos;s position. &quot;Henderson, however,  should clarify thispoint.(B) Whether Department intended in paper transmitted!that advance of $10 million monthly instalments should be tied to conclusion commercial sales contract.Department&apos;s reply:As to Point B,  it was not Departments intention in paper to make advance of $10 million monthly instalments contingentupon conclusion commercial sales contract.    It was Departmentsintention, however, to oast DMPA advance in such form as togive every proper inducement to the negotiation of a commercial agreement which we hoped could be concluded promptly.As British will understand, we might have preferred a lump-sum settlement tied in with a simultaneous solution of thecommercial contract problem.    This, however, was unacceptable to the United Kingdom and we have been proceeding on the generaltheory of their paper, entitled &quot;The Persian Oil Dispute&quot; sentto the Department.    That paper made it quite clear that oncethere had been agreement on arbitration, Iran would be free tosell oil to all comers and neither AIOG or Iran would be underobligation to enter into commercial agreement.-1 2-
DlvIPA has an interest in having a commercial agreement-arrived at.   Its assurance of continuing deliveries would bebetter under such circumstances.   However, in view of thefact that Musaddiq has been brought around to a general acceptance of arbitration without his former conditions,  onthe assurance that, once firm agreement on this has beenreached,  he will receive a $100 million advance from DMPAwe do not see how we can go back to a position of making asubstantial portion of the advance contingent upon theconclusions of a commercial agreement with instance.We do, however,  believe every effort should be made toget assurances from Musacidiq that AIOC35 would negotiate in good faith with &quot;Export Company&quot; looking toward a commercial agreement.(C)    Whether DMPA could legally negotiate contract withNI00 which left open question of price pending conclusioncommercial sales contract.Departments reply?As to your point (C), we believe some form of understanding with respect to price is necessary to cover (A)  the periodprior to the negotiation of a commercial agreement and (B)  the contingency that no commercial agreement is finally arrived at.We doubt whether Musaddiq would agree to,  or if he did that wecould rely on, a commitment to let DMPA fix the discount- fromtime to time unilaterally as it saw fit.

United States Embassy . London on,kth January. 1955)On 2nd January I had a difficult and exhaustingconversation with Musaddiq which lasted for three hours.     Inthe course of the talk, Saleh read to Musaddiq in Persian astatement which I had had prepared (see attachment).     Therewas considerable discussion during and after the reading of this statement.     However, Musaddiq refused to retreat from theposition which he has taken that he would not grant the tremendous power to A.1.0.0. over the economic life of Iranwhich would be possessed by the company if it had long-termcontractual rights to buy the bulk of Iran1s oil production.Toward the end of our talk, he admitted reluctantly and ratherindirectly that perhaps A.I.0.0. had in its possessionmarketing facilities and transport which Iran required, to dispose of its oil.     Although he would not be willing to placeIran under obligation to sell large amounts of oil to thecompany over a long period, he agreed that he would be preparedto negotiate with a. United States company or with an &quot;inter-national company,&quot; in which A.1,0.G. would participate, forthe sale of substantial amounts of oil and products over aperiod to be determined.     He explained that he meant by the term &quot;international company&quot; one registered in some countryother than the United Kingdom and composed of participantsof more than one nationality.     He indicated that since animportant role in such an &quot;international company&quot; wouldprobably be played by A.I.O.G., the new company should not be registered, in the United Kingdom.     When our conversation onthis subject had been completed , he wrote the following in hisnotebook:    &quot;We are willing to sign an agreement for the sale ofa definite quantity of crude and refined oil over a definite period of years with an international organisation in whichthe former A.1.0.0. may or may not be a participant or with a united States company or agency&quot;.In the course of our talk, we again touched on the arbitration question and Musaddiq wrote the following in Persianin his notebook:    &quot;The Iranian Government is willing to settle the question of -compensation with the former company by arbitration on the basis of any English law, acceptable to theformer a.1.0.0. , nationalising any industry in conformity withour previous conversations held on 25th and 31st December.&quot;When he had completed writing this, he launched into considerable detail regarding various terms of payment, etc.     I stopped him,pointing out that I was merely discussing principles and thatI was not in a position to negotiate details with him.      I suggested that we might find ourselves in a. state of hopelessconfusion if I tried to exchange messages on the technical^details of a settlement involving the various aspects of theproblem.     He indicated agreement and crossed out everythingwhich he had written down regarding this subject.     He repliedaffirmatively to my inquire whether the passage which I havequoted above still held good.-lh-
He once more made reference to the method of paying offcompensation and wrote the following down in Persian in hisnotebook:    &quot;After the signing of an arbitration agreement, 25per cent of the proceeds of all sales abroad of crude oil and oil products shall be deposited, in a bank acceptable to both parties.     The amounts deposited will be used so far as may benecessary to pay any compensation which may be found due to theformer company.      If there is any balance left after the paymentof compensation, that balance shall be turned over to the iranian Government.     After the decision of the arbitration board is handed down, if Iran is still found to be owing tothe former company, 25 per cent of the proceeds of sales abroadwill be payable to the former company until the full amount ofcompensation has been paid.&quot;     Musaddiq. said at this point thathe wanted to make one exception to the withholding of 25 percent for compensation.      He desired the entire $100,000,000from the United States Government.     He required all of it andhe did not want $75,000,000.      I replied that it would appearmore generous on his part and make a better general impressionif he would also agree to place 25 per cent of this amount intoescrow.     He said that he would like to do this but that Iranneeded every penny.      The United States could be sure that, none of these funds would be wasted.     They would be utilized tostrengthen the economy of Iran and help preserve it as part ofthe free world until the time that the revenues from oil shouldonce more begin to flow.     I informed him in frankness that Ihad only today received an indication that the United StatesGovernment agency which bought raw materials, including oil,appeared to be reluctant to pay down the entire $100,000,000immediately the agreement on arbitration was signed,      I hadthe impression that that organisation was thinking of payingabout a third of that sum immediately an arbitration agreement is signed provided that a sales contract were simultaneouslyentered into with N.I.O.C. or the Government of Iran and ofsubsequently paying the rest over a six or seven months period.Musaddiq. replied he would not make too great objection to a partial payment upon signature, but he hoped that at least,250,000,000 could be given Iran in cash at the outsets     Hisconfidence in any contract which the United States Governmentwould make was complete and he would not worry if. the UnitedStates Government agreed to pay the rest over a period of several months.
AttachmentMinute by U.S. Ambassador., Tehranin corporating the text of astatement read to Dr. Musaddiq on 2nd&quot;3&amp;S^3*1LJ-3SJ11.     As result my concern with certain aspects my latestconversation with Musaddiq. 31st December, I have arranged tosee him 9 p.m. this evening 2nd January.     In this discussion it is my intention to have Saleh, my interpreter, read him the text of a statement which I have prepared in an endeavour toplace the United States approach for an oil settlement before him in clear and unmistakable manner,     I intend to leave nocopy of this statement with him, but its text follows:&quot;I have not as yet received reply from Department State tomy telegram outlining our conversation 31st December.    However,some of developments which took place during that conversationare so important in character and may so vitally influenceoutcome of our efforts to effect settlement to oil problemthat I have decided to come to talk to you frankly about them without awaiting instructions from Department State.     I amdoing this in hope that it will be possible after our conversa-tion for me to send supplementary message altering somewhatmy telegram to Washington of 31st December,Before I touch on matter v/nich is troubling me I urge you to believe me when I say that my concern is not connected withwelfare A.I.O.G.I am convinced that oil experts are telling us truth whenthey say that A.I.0,0. can now carry on its business quiteprofitably without Iran oil.I am coming to you again entirely because of my concern for future of Iran and for what might happen to world if&quot;Iranas result of lack of economic stability should lose itsindependence.     As I told you during our last conversation,there is no question involved of granting A.I.O.G. anymonopoly on purchase of Iranian oil.      Iran will be free sellother customers any oil which it does not. contract sell A.I.O.G.During our conversation of 31st December I endeavouredemphasise how important it was that Iran should have some kindassurance, which could be reached only through long-term contract, that it be&quot;able sell substantial quantities oil abroadfor period of years.I hope that you fully understand that reason why UnitedStates Government has spent so much time and effort in trying tohelp find solution to oil problem is primarily because of itaconcern about Iran,In opinion United States Government, if oil problem notsettled and if Iran not able within not too distant future toderive substantial income from its oil resources, economic stability of country will be threatened.      It also opinionUnited States Government that loss Iran economic stabilitymight result in developments which would lead to lossindependence Iran.       As I told you on 23th December, duringdiscussions while I was in Department State, it seemed to thosewho participated that solution of oil problem involved fourfactors:(l)   Settlement question compensation;(2)   Assurance that Iran will be able derive substantialincome over period years from sale Iran oil;-16-
(3)   Assurance that Iran will continue as masterits own oil industry;    and(U)   That Iran will have placed at its disposal, untilincome begins accrue from sale oil, sufficient funds tomeet Governments financial needs and to enable itengage in some economic development.During our talk 25th December I tried present to you franklyviews   Department State in this respect and had hoped that youagreed with them.During our conversation 31st December, however, I gainedimpression that you had decided that factor Number 2 which Ihad outlined in our previous conversation, namely, that Iranbe assured that it be able sell substantial quantities oilproduced over period years, was not necessarily important andshould not be in any way connectod with other three factors,indeed, It- seemed tu me that you saw no reason why United StatesGovernment should be concerned about this particular factor.I thought that in my previous conversation of 25th December Ihad made it clear that in opinion Department State these fourfactors were inter-related, and that, if one of them should bemissing, there could be no settlement of the oil problem whichwouild assure a prosperous Iran.    That is kind of settlement which United States Government is seeking.     I also gainedimpression during our conversation 31st December that you didnot desire to enter into a contract with any international organisation in which A.I.0.0. might participate which wouldgive a.I.0.0. possibility   selling substantial quantitiesIranian oil abroad.      It seemed to me that you thought that itwould be too dangerous for Iran trust A.I.0.0. to market largequantities Iranian oil in view danger that A.1.0.0. might atsome time in order bring political or economic pressure onIron refuse purchase oil which it might be contractuallyobligated to buy and thus place Iran in difficult position.I have been much concerned at what appears to be change of attitude on your part in this respect.     During previousconversation which we have had I have understood, that if questioncompensation could be disposed of you would be quite prepareddeal with A.1.0.0. or any other company which might be in position market Iranian oil.   When I was in Washington basingmyself on v/hich I understood to be your statements in this regard I told Department State that I was quite sure that you would have no objection to dealing with A.I.0.C, in casequestion compensation could be settled satisfactorily.     It was partly on basis my statement in this regard that four-pointapproach which I outlined, to you in my conversation of25th December was elaborated.It is opinion all international oil experts with whomUnited States Government has consulted including those most anxious to be helpful to Iran that A.I.O.G. is only organisation which at present time has available transport facilities andmarkets for assuring sale Iranian oil in really large quantities.It possible therefore that in case it becomes convinced that youdo not desire and do not intend negotiate either directly or indirectly with a.1.0.0. or some company in v/hich A.I.O.C.participates for sale Iranian oil United States government might become discouraged and conclude that its efforts thus far to promote settlement have been in vain.
SOIt may be extremely difficult to persuade BritishGovernment to agree to arbitration of problem compensation on basis acceptable to you unless British Government could be convinced that as result arbitration proceedings A.I.O.C. mighthave possibility receiving such compensation as might bedetermined.     In case there no assurance that Iran is to beable sell its oil abroad in substantial, quantities over fixed period time British Government may take point of view that therecan be no assurance that A.1.0.0. will receive such compensation as may be determined, as due it since funds pay compensationobviously must come from sale oil in really substantial quantities.Similarly United iStates Government might face considerable criticism if instead buying oil from American companies whichhave oil to sell it should pay Iran up to $100 millions for oil to be delivered later when there may be no assurance regardingmaintenance independence Iran in absence oil settlement.   Publicopinion in U.S.A. may well take position that American government by advancing large&quot; sum money to Iran has not solved&quot;any problem whatsoever;    it has merely given Iran this sum to spend and when this money has been exhausted Iran will be injust as desperate position economically as it is at present.In view foregoing I earnestly hope in interests Iran thatyou will reconsider views which you expressed during our lastconversation and permit me so to inform Washington before decisions taken with regard my message reporting that conversa-tion.      If there to be settlement oil problem mutual trust mustbe established.     British Government for instance must trustIran to pay with good will and compensation which internationalarbitration may decide is due A.I.0.0. American Government musttrust Iran to deliver to it oil which it might pay for in advance^, .Iranian Government must have confidence in good faith A.1.0.0.to live up to any contractual obligations.     Unless there can bemutual display of confidence approach which United StatesGovernment has advanced may be dommed to failure.&quot;
(f)Memorandum received from the U.S. Embassy,, london on hth January, 195,5The following are the State Department1s views cn various aspects of the Iranian oil question:-1 .     Arbitrati onThe Department agrees with Ambassador Henderson&apos;s viewson this subject as contained in the attachment.   As theDepartment sees the problem, there are three possible lines which might be followed:-(a) As Ambassador Henderson suggests, the Court mightbe asked to constitute itself into an arbitration tribunal;(b) The Court could be requested to grant McNair leave to join Sanjabi to nominate a third arbitrator andto serve on the arbitral board;or(c) If the British find that neither alternative (a)or (b) is acceptable, we reluctantly suggest thatHenderson could try to persuade Musaddiq to agreeto the British Government&apos;s formal participationas a party, before the Court, by presenting him with a detailed draft agreement spelling outcarefully and plainly that in no way is the Courtgoing back on its earlier decision that the disputeis not subject to its jurisdiction and that theappearance of the United Kingdom is solely asA.I.0.C.&apos;s representative.Regarding (a) and (b), the Department thinks that itshould be possible to find a way around the prohibition againstjustices engaging in other business provided they do not acceptcompensation for their arbitration service.    The Departmentagrees with Ambassador Henderson that,  in any event, these two possibilities should not be rejected until the Court itselfhas been requested to consider them.    If the British agree,the Department believes that immediate consultation should beundertaken with the Court.    Unless there is objection by theBritish, the Department recommends that Ambassador1 Hendersonbe authorised to inform Musaddiq that the Court is being consulted,  thereby providing evidence of the interest of theBritish in coming to a rapid settlement.2.      price in the light of Ambassador Henderson&apos;s telegrams, theDepartment gathers that the discount of 35 per cent in theproposed D.M.P.A.  contract would probably be accepted byMusaddiq and the Department hopes that the British will alsofind it reasonable.3.      International company the Department believes that the latest proposal made byMusaddiq offers a satisfactory solution of the problem of negotiating a sales contract.    It suggests:-
103.(a)    That the name of the &quot;Export Company&quot; should, healtered to one which includes the word&quot;International&quot;;(h)    That this company should be incorporated inSwitzerland or in some other non-Britishjurisdiction;and(c)    That there should be sufficient non-british interests in the company to justify calling it&quot;International&quot; .The Department thinks, however,  that it probably would not benecessary to complete the actual formation of the company priorto the conclusion of an agreement on arbitration, provided thatassurances can be given to Musaddiq, that the company will beinternational and that it will be incorporated somewhere elsethan in the United Kingdom.   Although the Department is anxiousto see rapid progress by both sides,  it fears that if theconclusion of the arbitration agreement is tied to the completeorganisation of the &quot;International Company&quot;, the delays whichare inevitable in determining participation and in completing the incorporation arrangements would endanger the agreement onarbitration.    It would not be necessary for the company to bein existence before the D.M.P.A. advances are made, becausesuch advances could be made directly to N.I.O.C., even thoughthe &quot;International Company&quot; would be designated as the agentfor the receipt and deiiverjr of oil which D.M.P.A. buys.h.     The Department&apos;s preliminary thought is that A.I.O.C.might participate in the i( International Company&quot; to an extent which would be something less than half, with Shell taking agood slice in addition.   A.I.O.C. and Shell together would therefore have control.    Since the French have requestedparticipation, they might be given 5 to 10 per cent and theremainder held open for participation of American companies.5.      Message to MusaddiqThe Department thinks that we have reached the point where it is important that Ambassador Henderson be able to convey to Musaddiq some reaction from the United Kingdomrather than from the United States Government.    The determina-tion of what they might- be willing to say is, of course, amatter for the British to decide, but the Department would think that at least an expression should be conveyed of genuineinterest in the proposals which Musaddiq has made,  togetherwith a statement that they are under urgent study and thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government hopes soon to be able to discussdetails.   Ambassador Henderson could say at the same time thatthe United States Government regards the proposals whichMusaddiq has put forward offer a real basis for discussion andis ready to co-operate fully with the British and Iranian government in working out an agreement along these lines.
ATTACHMENTMemorandum &apos;by the United States Ambassador, Tehran,dated 4th&quot; January&quot;,  1953,  ( conmunicated by the U.S.Embassy, London on 4th January,&quot; 1955)As a result of my talk with Musaddiq on 2nd January, it isclear that he would be willing to have the A.I.O.C. make the de-rcision of which United Kingdom nationalization law it would be willing to have used as a basis for determining compensationby the arbitration board.     During our talk, I asked him three times if I had understood him correctly and each time he repliedin the affirmative.      I also wrote his formula down in his presence and at his dictation through my Iranian Counselor,Saleh.With respect to the other questions which arose fromByroade&apos;s conversation with the British on 1st January, mycomments are as follows:It would, in my opinion, wreck negotiations if an effortwere made to tie further monthly instalments to the conclusionof a contract for commercial sales.     The reason for such a tiewould clearly be to try to bring pressure on Iran to conclude a.sales contract.      I have been doing ray best to allay Iraniansuspicions, but if Iran should become conscious of such pressure,its suspicions would be aroused to an even greater extent than before.     I hope earnestly that there will be no insistence on this tie-in,      I also hope that there will be no insistence on leaving open the question of price in the D.M.P.A. contractuntil a commercial sales contract has been concluded.     If we try to tie the price paid by D.M.P.A.. to that negotiated by aninternational company, Iranian suspicions will again be aroused.I can fully appreciate why the British are concerned lest D.M.P.A.Swillingness to pay a price higher than that which an inter-national company would be willing to pay might prejudicenegotiations by the latter.      On the other hand, paragraph 7 ofthe Departments memorandum regarding the use of D.M.P.A.funds contains provision that the price provided for in para-graph 4 shall be modified appropriately to conform with theprice provisions of any commercial contract with the ;exportcompany&quot;.   At the beginning of its negotiations with N.I.O.C.,D.M.P.A. could emphasise orally that the tentative price set is,in its opinion, higher than what the commercial price is likelyto be and that it should eventually, therefore, receive for itsmoney more oil than the contract indicates.     At the time that D.M.P.A.&apos;s contract is signed,  its statement to the effect could be given publicity in Iran, if this would not be embarrassing to N.I.O.O.     It would be preferable in my opinion if an agency of the United States Government were not used as a battering ramto try to obtain from N.I.O.C. the lowest possible price for along-term commercial contract.     I gained the impression from thereport of the conversations in London that the British are inclined to view sceptically and with reserve the apparent willingness ofMusaddiq to make certain concessions, as well as the desirewhich he has expressed to see the oil question settled as soon-as possible.     The experiences which they have had in the past,part of which I have had the honor to share, furnish them witha considerable degree of justification for their attitude.I concur with their views that Musaddiq is strongly allured atthe possibility of obtaining  100,000,000.     I hope, on theother hand, that the British doubts will not cause them to regard the situation as entirely without hope or  to examine each proposal

It would be preferable in my opinion if an agency of the United States Government were not used as a battering ramto try to obtain from N.T.O.C. the lowest possible price for along-term commercial contract.      I gained the impression from thereport of the conversations in London that the British are inclined to view sceptically and with reserve the apparent willingness ofMusaddiq to make certain concessions, as well as the desirewhich he has expressed to see the oil question settled as soonas possible.

I hope, on theother hand, that the British doubts will not cause them to regard the situation as entirely without hope or  to examine each proposal
3*which  Musaddiq agrees to or makes with such suspicion that weshall get mired down in a morass from which there is nopossibdlity of a solution emerging.     As I have previously indicatedin telegrams, I would not undertake to guarantee what Musaddiqwill or will not do.     When I loft him last evening, I had theimpression for the first time that he was beginning to believethat there is a real possibility of a settlement at an earlydate.      I hope that there will not be such a lag in developmentsthat he will ag-ain become discouraged and revert to his usual in-transigent frame of mind.     I am convinced from my analysis ofthe present situation that an agreement from Musaddiq will be easier to obtain than from any other Prime Minister who mightsucceed him.      If we are to reach agreement with him, we mustmove rapidly.     We cannot afford to become discoiiraged at  hisflares of intransigence or at temporary reverses.     On31st December, we had a partial reverse and we may have more.Nevertheless, I think that in general we have made tangibleprogress.     Although Musaddiq, because of the prospect offinancial aid, has thus far shown more interest in the settle-,ment of the compensation question than he has in the matter of future sales, I detected in our last talic an increasing interestregarding future sales.      I feel that this interest will continueto increase as we surmount the compensation problem.    Toan extent, Musaddiq has a one-track mind and it is hard for himto concentrate on more than one problem at a time.     If thecompensation questioii is settled and an international companyset up, I would not be surprised if he tried to persuade it to contract for the purchase of more oil than the company felt it could absorb.It is my sincere hope that the British will reconsider theirattitude toward the judges of the I.C.J. being used as an arbitration panel.     I wonder whether it really was the intentof Article 34 of the Cou.rt&apos;s statute to prevent judges from being of maximum help in the settlement of a dispute which,although it might be between a private company and a state, is nevertheless developing into a threat to world peace.      It mayhave been the intent of the /Article to prevent the Court fromdissipating its energies on a mass of litigation which was really not of fundamental international importance.     the usefulness of the Court might be enhanced if, in a case of thiskind, it could resolve itself into, or permit several of itsjudges to help form, an arbitration tribunal.     I am partiallyresponsible for the suggestion that certain justices might dropout if they did not want to participate in the proceedings.Musaddiq originally suggested that the &quot;full panel&quot; of judges serve as an arbitral tribunal.-     I pointed out to him that it might be physically impossible to have a whole panel.      The Indian and soviet judges did not participate in the recent proceedingsbetween the United Kingdom and Iran.      Similarly, some  judgesmight not want or might not be able to participate in arbitrationproceedings.     Musaddiq replied that if certain judges did not take part, he would be willing to regard as a representativearbitral board those who did participate.     If it is not practicable for all or most of the justices to serve as an arbitra-tion board, it is my hope- that the British will be more sympathetic to Musaddiq&apos;s suggestion that Sanjabi and McNair form the nucleus of ah arbitral tribunal of three.     If the matter were presented :in the proper light to the I.C.J.,  it seems to me that some wayshould be found for McNair to be given leave from the Court inorder that he might act in this capacity.     Since Sanjabi is nota regular judge, he could serve without the Court&apos;s sanction.The prohibition against judges engaging in any other business wassurely not intended, to prohibit them from taking part in quasi-judicial proceedings of this kind which are of such great significance to the stability of the world.     My efforts   here will,&apos;in any case, suffer a serious setback if there is not animmediate approach in good faith to the Court to determine whether
it would be willing to constitute itself into an arbitralpanel or to sanction McNair to act as an arbiter.      If the suggestions which Musaddiq has made regarding the use of theCourt&apos;s judges in arbitration proceedings are turned down asthe result of British misgivings instead of as the result of theCourt&apos;s decision that it would be improper to agree to them, itwould be hard to convince Musaddiq again that the British reallydesire an early settlement or are not dragging their feet.     since its recent decision, Musaddiq is infatuated with the Court&apos;sfairness.     To persuade him to place his trust in any otherarbiter would be difficult.     Furthermore, for the presentthe I.C.J. is popular with the Iranian people.
