secret. (53) 49 COPY NO. 6Q6th FEBRUARY, 1953.cabinet coal PRICES.Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National Service.I have now had the opportunity of reading the minutes of the Cabineton the question of an increase in coal prices (C.C.(53) 7th Conclusions, Minute 8)and of discussing the matter with my Parliamentary Secretary.2. The issue is a most important one and I think we ought to see whether there is some way of reconciling the view that the loss arising from the currentoperations of the Coal Board should not be a charge on the Exchequer, with the opposing view that an increase in coal prices at this time would have serious effects on the whole national economy.   It is possible, in my view, to do this and also to meet the Secretary of State&apos;s desire to put the maximum amount of pressure on the miners to give full effect to their offer of Working Parties and toincrease their productivity.3. What I would suggest for consideration is as follows:-(1) The mining wages claim should be disposed of on the lines which theCoal Board now have in view.   The settlement of this claim would also presumablyclear the way to a further agreement with regard to Saturday working and to theimmediate setting up of Working Parties to deal with productivity throughoutthe mining industry.   This is, of course, a matter for the Coal Board and theGovernment should not take any hand in negotiations.(2) Immediately the wages issue is settled the National Coal Board wouldhave to seek the approval of the Government for a 10 per cent increase in prices to recoup its deficit ( 35 millions by the end of 1953).(3) The Governments action at this point should be to say&apos;that, beforeplacing this additional burden on the economy in this critical year, with all itsattendant ill effects, it must be quite satisfied that the mining industry cannotproduce enough extra coal in 1953 to enable the Board to balance its budget.It should, however, be made plain that if the Government cannot obtain this assurance from the mining industry, then there will be no alternative but to passon the increased costs to the consumer.(4) At this point, the Government should invite the National Union of mineworkers (N.U.M.) and the National Coal Board (N.C.B.) to meet them.   Atthis meeting the Government should make a statement on the following lines:-&quot;The Government had noted with interest and satisfaction the offer of a new drive for increased productivity in the mining industry made by theN.U.M., and the arrangements for increased co-operation to&quot;that end which were
being made by the Union and the N.C.B.  The Government had now to consider urgently the financial position of the Board which, as a result of wage increases and other increased costs, is running at a heavy annual deficit of  35 millions.The Government was most reluctant to pass that deficit on to theconsumer in the form of an increase in coal prices.   If it had to do this, theresult would be that the price of coal would go up by 6/- a ton, steel by 12/- a ton,rail costs by  4 millions (here would follow some other statistics of resultingincreases).This would place a quite unacceptable burden on our export industriesat a time when it was of the utmost importance to keep export prices down, andwould raise retail prices and costs to the housewife, thus making it impossiblefor the Government to carry out its declared object of reducing the cost of living.It was estimated that a 5 per cent increase in productivity representingan additional 12 million tons of deep mined coal would wipe out the deficit and atthe same time would provide extra coal much needed for export.   If the N.U.iv.and the N.C.B. believed that such an increase could be achieved through the useof the new Working Parties and the other methods contemplated for increasingproduction, the Government would hold up passing on the increased cost of coal to the consumer for three months.   If at the end of this period it was shown thatthe required increase in output was likely to be achieved, then the Governmentwould consider continuing to finance the deficit until the end of 1953, whenincreased output would have worked off the loss.If, however, the N.U.M. and N.C.B. felt that this task was beyond their capacity, the Government would have no option but to increase the price of coalat once.   The Government felt sure, however, that it would not appeal to themining industry in vain at this critical time.   It was certainly not possiblefor the Exchequer to bear any loss on coal production but the alternative wasthe starting of a new spiral of increased costs in a year when we were meetingintensified competition in the export markets. &quot;4. If the miners1 answer to this approach was a promise of 5 per cent increase in output, then the risk should be taken for a limited period of threemonths, even if the cost should be in the nature of  9 or  10 millions.   This wouldin any case be a maximum figure as some increase in output would no doubt beachieved.   If the miners, on the contrary, refused to make the attempt or said it was beyond their capacity (something which they would find it very difficultto prove to the satisfaction of the rest of the country) then the Government in increasing coal prices would have the wuole country on their side and would have placed the responsibility far more squarely on the shoulders of the miners thanit would be possible to do by announcing a wage increase and price increasetogether.   Nothing is therefore lost by making this initial appeal but much may be gained by this human approach to the miners.W.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W.1.6th February, 1953.
