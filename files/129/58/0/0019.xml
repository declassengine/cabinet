(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential.(53) 1916TH JANUARY, 1953CABINETPARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGENote by the Lord chancellor at the meeting of the Cabinet on Tuesday, 30th December, 195Z, theLord Privy Seal, the Home Secretary, the Law Officers and myself were invitedto consider whether Parliamentary privilege could properly be claimed in respectof a communication sent to Members of Parliament in this country complainingof the administration of justice in Kenya (C. C. (52) 108th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. Our conclusions on this matter are expressed in the attached memorandum which has been prepared at our request by the Attorney-General.SIMONDSHouse of Lords, S. W. 1,16TH JANUARY, 1953ANNEXPARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE:   MR. GEORGE WTGG&apos;S motion of THE 19TH DECEMBER, 1952Memorandum by the Attorney-GeneralMr. Pritt was called on in the Supreme Court at Nairobi on 23rd december to show cause why he should not be committed to prison for contempt of the resident Magistrate^ Court at Kapenguria by publishing to the East AfricanStandard newspaper statements contained in a cable sent by Mr. Pritt to four british Members of Parliament and particularly the allegation that &quot;It amounts in all to a denial of justice&quot;.2.        Although the document handed to the Press in Kenya was, in fact, a copyof a cable sent by Mr. Pritt to London in answer to inquiries by four Members ofParliament, it appears from newspaper reports that no reliance was placed on thearguments of the Attorney-General on the action of Mr. Pritt in communicating with Members of Parliament and the Chief Justice of Kenya in giving judgment infavour of Mr. Pritt on 31st December made it clear by implication that sue:,communication had no relevance to the contempt proceedings.WOCOPY NO.
3. It therefore seems evident that, if the Committee of Privileges ever hadto consider the matter, it should not have the least difficulty in concluding that nobreach of privilege had occurred.4.        It is, however, obviously most desirable in view of the present situationin Kenya, that the Speaker should confirm his previous ruling that there is noprim a facie case, and thus prevent Mr. Wigg and his friends from gaining theappearance of success which would result from a resolution referring the question to the Committee of Privileges.5.        It has been suggested that the Speaker might be asked to rule against mr.. Wigg on the preliminary objection that the privilege of Parliament cannotextend to anything said or done in connection with the administration of justice in kenya and it is, in fact, this suggestion which has led to the present considerationof the matter.6.        After careful consideration, I find myself unable to advise my colleagues that it would be useful or wise to make such a proposal to the Speaker.    The Househas always been very jealous of its privileges and there are substantial grounds for doubting whether the Speaker would be prepared, or indeed entitled, to makethe ruling suggested.    It is at least strongly arguable that the power of the house to pass a resolution on the subject of privilege cannot be fettered by any national or territorial limits, and is not dependent in any way upon the availability of sanctions;  there is, for example, the precedent of a resolution in the year 1733(Dunbar&apos;s case) condemning the action of the Massachusetts House of Representa-tives in censuring a witness for evidence given by him in London before aCommittee of the House of Commons.    The House of Commons in that caseresolved nem. con,   that the presuming to call any person to account for evidence given before the    House or any Committee of it was &quot;an audacious proceeding anda high violation of the privilege of the House&quot;, and ordered that a Committee beappointed to inquire into who were the authors and abettors of the proceedings.7.        Nor, in my view, can the Speaker properly base his ruling on the groundthat such a resolution (if otherwise proper) would involve interference with a Courtof Justice.    The precise relationship between Parliament and the Judiciary(whether domestic or colonial) has never been determined and constitutionalauthorities agree that a head-on clash would still be possible, if the issue ofcontempt of court versus privilege were specifically raised.    Such a question must be for the House and not the Speaker to decide.8. I therefore recommend my colleagues to report that reliance cannotsafely be placed by way of preliminary objection on any limit of jurisdiction.9.        I do, however, recommend that the Speaker should be strongly urged to rule, on the merits of the case, that the proceedings in the High Court of Kenyahave merely reinforced his earlier decision and that there is no prima faciecase,10.        On 19th December, the Speaker had fully before him the action andstatement by Mr. Thacker, the Kapenguria Magistrate, and clearly ruled that nothing done or said by Mr. Thacker could be regarded as raising a prima faciecase of privilege.    He said (Hansard 19th December, Col. 1817) &quot;The mere factthat the trial has been postponed . .. does not, I think, come within the category of any action against Mr. Pritt ... Until something is done which in the opinionof the House might be considered to be a breach of privilege requiring examination,I think we cannot go further with the matter. &quot;    If, therefore, a prima facie case isnow to be made out, it must be based upon the action taken since 19th December.
11.        As I have already pointed out, it appears clearly from the reports of thecas^ that in the proceedings against Mr. Pritt no reliance was placed on the fact of communication with the Members of Parliament in London, nor was any suggestion made throughout the proceedings that this in itself constituted orcontributed to contempt of court.    If, therefore, any complaint were to be basedupon what happened in the Kenya High Court, it could only be upon the unreliableassumption that every statement which would otherwise amount to contempt of court can be made with impunity, provided that a copy of the statement istransmitted to Members of Parliament.    Even if references were to be made tothe terms of the cable itself, this ended with the words &quot;Please publish all this&quot;;and could not, therefore, by any stretch of the imagination be described as a mereconfidential communication with Members of Parliament.12.        In these circumstances, to use the wording of the Speaker&apos;s own rulingof     19th   December, &quot;Nothing has been done against Mr. Pritt which involves any interference with Members of Parliament or their privilege&quot;.    This conclusion is well supported by the &quot;reductio ad absurdum&quot; contained in the letter fromSir Alan Herbert published in the Times of the 9th January.conclusion would therefore advise my colleagues that while the Speaker should notbe asked to rule on the objection of territorial limitation, he should be strongly urged to hold that nothing has happened since his previous ruling to cause him to alter it, and, indeed, that the proceedings in the High Court of Kenya merely serve to reinforce his decision.     For this purpose I suggest that, if possible, a completeofficial report of the proceedings should be provided by the Colonial Office andsupplied to the Speaker in good time before 20th January.    The delivery of this to the Speaker would provide a good opportunity for making the submissionoutlined above.L.H.
