Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1953SECRETC. (S3) 465th February, 1953CABINETTHE FUTURE OF NATIONAL service memorandum by the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Labourand National ServiceFuture of the National Service scheme the effect of Section 61 of the National Service Act, 1948, is that, unlessspecial steps are taken, men who attain the age of 18 after 31st December, 1953,cannot be called up. Unless, therefore, authority is obtained to continue the call-up after that date, the National Service component of the active forces will beginrapidly to decline as from 1st January, 1954, and there is no other source from whichthe resultant Forces man-power deficiency can be made good.2. Similarly, if the present scheme is not continued beyond December 1953,the National Service Reserve will begin to decline as from the end of 1955 and willhave virtually ceased to exist by mid-1959.3. We are satisfied that the Act must be continued in force, and we recom-mend that it should be extended for a period of 5 years. It has already been statedin Parliament that there is no prospect of our being able to dispense with the call-up at the end of this year, and there is no doubt that the public expects a con-tinuanee of national service. In presenting the decision to the public it should bemade plain that until there is some substantial change for the better in the inter-national situation it is impossible to allow the armed forces and their reserves tobe depleted to the extent that would occur if the call-up was allowed to lapse. its continuance, however, does not necessarily mean that call-up will remain at itspresent level for 5 years, and the renewed powers will be exercised in such a way as to reduce the burden of national service both as regards numbers called up andthe length of the period of whole-time service to the minimum that the inter-national situation permits. Should the international situation permit, the periodof whole-time service will also be reviewed. The critics and opponents of nationalservice will no doubt argue that any extension should be on a year-to-year basis.Such a proposal must be resisted. It would make planning difficult; it would be unrealistic; it would create a sense of uncertainty, and it might have serious ill-effects on the effort and morale of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and other friendly Powers. A period of 5 years follows the precedent set by the Act and hasthe advantage of extending the operation of the Act beyond the date of the next general Election.4. We accordingly propose that the necessary Oider-in-Council (which wiltbe subject to Affirmative Resolution) should be introduced extending the operationof the National Service Act until 31st December, 1958.Position of National Service Men on Completion of Statutory Period of services. The National Service man on completion of his period of 3^ years in theReserve is, under existing legislation, then clear of all further recall liability. Manywill be in this position at the early age of about 24, even those who have had theircall-up deferred will generally cease to be liable to recall at between the ages of27 and 30.Copy No.8143673
6. At its peak the number of national service men in the Reserve will notexceed 450/500,000. This number, together with the regular and volunteer reserves,will not meet the needs of the Services for trained men on mobilisation and in thefirst few months of war. The balance on present plans will be made good fromamongst Class Z and G reserves, the youngest of whom are now in their middletwenties; many are in the thirties, with a number of specialists, &amp;c, in the 40-50range.7. On military and political grounds it would be impossible to justify aposition in which the older Class Z and G reservists were still liable to recall, whilst the younger ex-national service reservists had no such liability unless and until further legislation were introduced.8. On grounds of equity and to enable mobilisation planning to proceed, werecommend that legislation should be introduced forthwith to extend for a further period of 5 years the reserve liability of all National Service men called up in the5 years 1949 to 1953 inclusive. In present circumstances it is not considered essential on military grounds, or desirable on political grounds, that during thisextended period of reserve liability, a National Service man should be required tocarry out training, and it is simply proposed that he should be liable to recall for service in an emergency, subject to the normal statutory processes governing the calling up of reserves.9. If the necessary legislation were deferred until war seemed imminent itwould not be possible to prepare satisfactory mobilisation plans. These at presentare on the basis of individual call-up and the right to ask for certain informationwhen required, e.g., address, occupation, &amp;c, is essential.Position of Class Z and G Reservists10. If the proposal to extend the period of reserve liability of NationalService men called up under the present scheme is accepted, the positionof existing Class Z and G reservists should be clarified at the same time, in regardboth to the upper age limit (at present no age has been published) beyond whichthey would no longer be regarded as liable to recall in an emergency, and also totheir liability to be called up for refresher training. This could no longer bejustified if National Service reservists during their extended period of reserveliability were not to be liable to such call-up.11. It is therefore proposed that the legislation extending the reserveliability of National Service men should incorporate provision whereby the liability of Class Z and G reservists to re-call only in an emergency, and up to age 45 in the initial stages of an emergency, may be confirmed. Thiswould have the incidental effect of removing existing doubts, to which attention has been drawn by the Law Officers of both the past and present Government,about the legal liability of Class Z and G reservists to be recalled in an emergency.Presentation12. We have considered how our proposals might most effectively be pre-sented to Parliament and the public. It seems unlikely that young men in theirmiddle twenties would expect to be clear of any further liability for service in theForces. They may well expect that, like large numbers of Class Z and G reservistsin 1951 and 1952, they would be recalled from time to time to keep them up-todate in training. Although, if the Cabinet approve the proposals in this Paper,it will be made clear to these national service men that they will be retained on the organised reserves of the Forces for a further 5 years and will thus be liable forrecall at once in an emergency, they can also be told that there is no present intention -of attaching any training obligations to them during this period.13. As to the Class Z and G reservists, one effect of the call-up of largenumbers of these reservists for training in recent years has been to bring home to them their position as reservists for an emergency. To remove the statutoryweakness of the present powers to recall them seems unlikely therefore to excitemuch comment. On the other hand, many of the older men will be glad to have it authoritatively stated that if over 45 they will not be called up in the initial stages of an emergency. As numerous Questions in Parliament have shown, the anxiety of men over that age that they might be so called up is a real one.
14. We consider, therefore, that our present proposals, as affecting the categories of reservists mentioned in the preceding two paragraphs, should berepresented as a clarification of their position with regard to further service withthe Forces; and that it should be stated that the Government have chosendeliberately to limit the liability in both cases to one of recall in a major emergency.Parliamentary Time-Table15. The introduction of the necessary Order-in-Council would be the responsi-bility of the Minister of Labour and National Service, and the Order must be effective before 31st December, 1953. The Bill required to provide for an extensionof reserve liability of National Service men, and to clarify the recall position of ClassZ and G reservists, would probably be the responsibility of the Minister of Defence.While it need not be passed before mid-1954, when the first National Servicereservists will begin to flow out of the Reserve, we suggest that it would be more convenient if both measures were introduced and passed simultaneously at the com-mencement of the 1953-54 Parliamentary Session. The early passage of this Billis also desirable to rectify as soon as possible the doubtful powers of recall of class Z and G reservists referred to in paragraph 11 above. The two measures would presumably require some days of Parliamentary time. In any event, anannouncement of the Governments intentions will have to be made either in theDefence White Paper or at the latest in the Defence Debate.16.   We invite the Cabinet to agree to :  (1) the extension of the current National Service scheme for a further 5 yearsbeyond 31st December, 1953;(2) the simultaneous continuance for a further 5 years of the reserve liability of National Service men called up under the provisions of the NationalService Acts 1948-50 during the years 1949 to 1953 inclusive, withliability to recall during this extended period only in an emergency andsubject to the normal statutory processes governing the calling up of reserves, but with no present intention of imposing any training liabilityduring this further 5-year period.(3) definite assurances being given, complementary to (2), to Class Z and Greservists that in future they will be regarded as liable to recall only inan emergency, and up to age 45 in the initial stages of an emergency;(4) the Minister of Labour and National Service preparing the Order in Councilrequired to give effect to (1), and the Minister of Defence the Billnecessary to give effect to (2) and (3) for simultaneous introduction atthe latest at the beginning of the 1953-54 Parliamentary Session;(5) the announcement of the Governments intentions at an early date.(Initialled)        A.W. M.5th February, 1953.
