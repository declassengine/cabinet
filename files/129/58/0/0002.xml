1SECRETC. (53) 22nd January,1953,COPY NO.CABINETDELIMITATION OF TERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs,I circulate the following for the information of my colleague s.On 29th July, 1952, the Cabinet invited the Minister of Defence toexamine the military significance of the new base-line method of measuringterritorial waters (CC.(52) 74th Conclusions, Minute 5).   They also invited theCommonwealth Secretary and myself to ascertain the views held on the question by the Governments of other Commonwealth countries and of the United States.2. The Minister of Defence undertook a study of the military significance   &quot;of the new methods, and reached the conclusion that their adoption by her majesty&apos;s Government would be militarily undesirable.   He gave me theopportunity of commenting.   I cannot accept all the assumptions on which this conclusion was based, and I still consider that the balance of advantage lies infavour of the adoption of the new methods by Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   Anumber of detailed points still remain to be discussed between our two Departments,3. Meanwhile H0M. Ambassador in Washington has stated that the UnitedStates Government are not at present able to give Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenttheir views on the measurement of territorial waters.   United States policy maywell be affected by the change in the Administration in January, and the state department hope to be in a position to discuss the matter further with us earlyin the New Year.   No replies have yet been received from commonwealth governments.4. In the circumstances and after consultation with the Minister of defence i recommend that the Cabinet should postpone further consideration of thequestion for the moment.   It is very desirable to know at least the views of theUnited States Government before any final decisions are taken and I propose to try to arrange for discussions with them as soon as possible after the new administration is in office.5. If the discussions take place, I regard it as important that we should enter upon them as far as possible agreed on a firm policy of our own and I hopethat in preparing the brief for these discussions Departments will come closer to an agreed view than they have done in the past.6. I do not propose any further discussion by the Cabinet at this stage.I will bring the question before my colleagues again as soon as the results ofthe discussions with the United States Government are known, or earlier if forany reason they should be delayed.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,2nd January, 1953.
