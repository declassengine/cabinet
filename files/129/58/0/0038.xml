(53) 382nd February, 1953CABINETTHE COLLECTIVE APPROACH TO FREER TRADE AND CURRENCIESNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theChancellor of the Exchequer- ..: We circulated for the information of our colleagues a draft memorandum to be handed to the United States Administration (C. (53) 22).2. We have now received the comments of H.M. Ambassador in Washington,and, apart from purely drafting and presentational points, there are three main issues to decide: -(a) Introduction. The Ambassador asks whether we can forestall possiblecriticisms about the impact of the Plan on Europe by explaining, forexample, that the general removal of restrictions for which the Planprovides will be the soundest basis for expansion of European trade.We consider that this point can best be dealt with in a generalform by adding after paragraph 8: &quot;The United Kingdom Government would emphasise its aware-ness that its proposals carry important consequences for other western european countries. That is why the proposals are directed towardsthe preparation of a collective plan, in which Western european countries would participate fully, together with the United States andthe Commonwealth. The United Kingdom Government does not see in these proposals any weakening of its links with Western Europe.The proposals will certainly involve some modification of the existing financial arrangements in Western Europe, but this was always inevitablewhen the time came for advance to a wider freedom of trade andcurrencies. But it is the firm belief of the United Kingdom Govern-ment that it will be possible to frame a plan which will strengthen theWestern European economy, and provide a more solid foundation for western European political and military strength than the present arrangements can possibly do.&quot;(b) Internal Policies paragraph 9. The Ambassador suggests some expan-.:fi si on of paragraph 9 on Internal Policies, and we suggest a redraftaccordingly:  Delete penultimate sentence &quot; The United Kingdom Govern-ment .... internal and external economy&quot; and add at, end ofparagraph:  &apos;       5&quot;&quot; The United Kingdom Government has in the last twelvemonths made considerable progress towards a sounder internal and external policy. The rapid improvement in the balance-of-pay-ments and the restoration of confidence in sterling result to some43644
extent from temporary factors and the application of stringentimport restrictions. But they have been strongly helped by thegeneral economic and financial policies of the Government, asfollows:  (a) the change in monetary policy and the tightening of credit;(b) the reduction of the overload on the economy, and measuresto check the growth of Government expenditure;(c) the reduction of food subsidies, and the beginnings of decontrolmeasures designed to give greater play to the movement ofprices and commercial considerations, instead of physicalcontrols;(d) the first steps to reduce taxation and provide greater incentives.The Government intends to continue to move forward on theselines. It will guard against any return of inflationary conditions;it will seek to ensure that unused resources are devoted either directly to export expansion or to the development of industrial capacity which will further strengthen our competitive power; itwill seek to achieve an increase of production for the same ends. Inthe last twelve months, good progress has been made; but theUnited Kingdom Government recognises that this is only thebeginning.&quot;(c) The Annex. The Ambassador suggests that it is not wise to include the annex and that the two questions gold and indebtedness would bebetter discussed orally at the time of the visit. In handing over theMemorandum, he could, if necessary, say that there were certain other points which Ministers wished to discuss.J We agree that in the light of this the Annex should be omitted, together with paragraph 58.Our colleagues will recall, however, that on the question of gold it was agreed at the recent Commonwealth Economic Conference that there would be further discussion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministers of finance of Canada, Australia and South Africa about the timing and manner of the approach to the Americans and by whom it should be made. We must accordinglyclear this proposed procedure with these Governments. The Chancellor has there-fore sent a telegram to them. In this, he explains that, while there will be no reference to gold in our paper, the Ambassador, when delivering it, will explain that there are parallel but very important questions, such as gold, which ministers will wish to discuss during their visit to Washington. During the talks, ministers would explain the position to the Americans and find out how they thought thematter could best be handled.3.   We accordingly recommended that (a) the draft Memorandum should be approved as amended (paragraph above);(b) we should be authorised to instruct H.M. Ambassador in Washington to hand in the Memorandum as revised at whatever date we think most appropriate prior to our visit to Washington;(c) subject to any comments which may be received from Australia, SouthAfrica or Canada on gold questions, H.M. Ambassador, in handing inthe Memorandum, should state that there are two parallel but very important matters which we should also wish to discuss with the americans,, namely, gold (and the gold market) and inter-governmentalindebtedness.A.
