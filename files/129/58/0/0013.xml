THE CORONATION:   FOOD supplies memorandum by the Minister of FoodMy colleagues will wish to know of the arrangements which I have inmind for rations at the time of the Coronation.    Many thousands of visitorswill be entertained privately and otherwise.    Local authorities and other bodies will wish to organise celebrations of one sort and another.    In generalour normal arrangements will look after much of the problem.    Tea will beplentiful at moderate prices:  flour for cakes, etc. , will be in full supply.The meat ration should be reasonably satisfactory and there will be plentifulsupplies of unrationed ham and sausages and canned meats.    Eggs should havebeen decontrolled and sweets derationed.    Some exceptional provision would however be justified by the occasion,2.     Food BonusesThe most acceptable &quot;extra&quot; for the housewife would be an additional1-lb. of sugar.     Three &quot;bonuses&quot; are already included in my Departmentscurrent programme, but I can now find a fourth for the Coronation from the sugar available to me this year.     The additional sugar would be more useful if accompanied by 4 ozs. of margarine and cooking fat.    This however couldnot be met from commercial stocks and would cost an additional  -! million in non-sterling non-dollar currency not provided for in the import programme.I hesitate to recommend this expenditure on a marginal item unless mycolleagues feel strongly that our bag of Coronation rations would not be complete without it.3.    CaterersCaterers would get their share of the sugar and fat bonuses.     Forthe rest, the flexible arrangements under which they draw supplies will enablethem to meet additional demands.4.    Food ManufacturersThere will be extra calls upon a wide range of food manufacturerswho are now feeling acutely the effect of reduced allocations   (due to importcuts) and of the virtual disappearance of privately imported fondant andsweetened fat.    I can find enough sugar within the current programme to restore to the industries chiefly affected about half of the cut made inNovember, 1951, and the first issue of the additional sugar would be so timedas to afford the maximum relief to manufacturers during the Coronationperiod.    It would also help the manufacturers throughout the rest of the year.I should also let certain manufacturers have very small extra quantities off at and other ingredients before Coronation week for the production of potatocrisps, toffee apples and similar items likely to be in popular demand.COPY NO. 66SECRETC.(53) 1310TH JANUARY, 1953CABINET
At present bona fide organisers of parties, for example street parties,which are neither private nor commercial are entitled to small quantities of sugar and fat.    During Coronation week I propose to allow such parties toreceive all rationed foods (including meat) on the higher scale to whichcommercial caterers are entitled.     The scale is based on the numbers to be served.6.    Ox RoastingI have been asked in the House and elsewhere whether the traditionalpractice of ox roasting will be allowed.    Under rationing there are obvious objections to such activities, though they have been allowed in special caseswhen the ox was provided as a gift from a dollar source:  but on such an occasion it would scarcely be appropriate to maintain a rigid ban on traditionalfestivities of this kind.    I therefore propose to say that, subject to certain conditions, ox roasting will be allowed.     The conditions which I have in mindare:-(i)    that the festivity must be in Coronation week;(ii)    that the sponsor must be either a local authority ora responsible body (e.g. a college) which had made a practice of ox roasting at recentCoronations;(iii)    that the cooked meat must be given away;(iv)    that the arrangement would not apply to smalleranimals.7. As an early announcement is desirable I ask my colleages&apos; agreement to the foregoing proposals.G. LI. -G.Ministry of Food, S.W.1.10TH JANUARY, 1953.
