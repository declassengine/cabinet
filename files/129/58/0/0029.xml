(1HPrinted for the Cabinet,  January 1953CONFIDENTIALC. (53) 2924th January, 1953CABINETSUNDAY OBSERVANCE bill memorandum BY THE HOME secretary at their meeting on 22nd January (C.C. (53) 4th Conclusions, Minute 2) theCabinet agreed that the decision on this Bill should be left to a free vote of theHouse of Commons and that the Government should not offer any guidance to members on the principle of the Bill. I undertook to submit a memorandum setting out the advantages and disadvantages of holding an enquiry.2. The suggestion that there should be an enquiry has received.a good dealof support in the Press and there is a motion on the Order Paper calling on theGovernment to appoint a committee of enquiry, which is supported by a numberof Members, including Mr. Chuter Ede. It will no doubt be argued that an enquiry is desirable for the following reasons: -(a) in order to examine in detail the present lawAs regards this I do not feel that there is in fact a case for an enquiry.Although the law is archaic and illogical, there is no serious doubt about its effect. When the Sunday Entertainments Bill (which made possible the licensing of Sunday cinemas and legalised certain other forms of Sundayentertainment, such as museums, picture galleries and zoos) was introduced in 1932 it was not found necessary to appoint a committee of enquiry first.If this Bill receives a Second Reading and the House want to have a state-ment of the existing law before the Committee Stage there is no reason whythe Government should not publish a White Paper stating in general termswhat is the present position.(b) that a committee would be able to find out what public opinion is on thecase for reformI very much doubt whether&apos;a committee would find it possible to do this.It would be presented with evidence from all sorts of quarters representingconflicting views and would undoubtedly find it very hard to assess the weight to be given to this evidence. No doubt on some minor issues, such as theplaying of games by private individuals on Sunday, it might be able to reportsome measure of agreement, but on all the really difficult questions it could do no more than state the views expressed by the various witnesses. It seems unlikely that this would assist the House of Commons to come to a decisionon the question of the amendment of the law. The views of the variousorganisations which take an interest in the subject of Sunday observance arealready well known and Members must be well aware of the general stateof public opinion in their own constituencies,3. These are, I think, the only advantages which are likely to be urged inthe debate for the appointment of a committee. The only remaining advantage,which is not likely to be mentioned, is that the appointment of a committee wouldrelieve Members of the need to express their own views on this highly controversialquestion. There will obviously be a temptation to Members on both sides of theHouse to shelve responsibility for deciding the general issues of principle on to a43590Copy No.59
committee. Apart from the fact that this is impossible since only the House inthe last resort can decide these issues, there is a grave danger that if the Govern-ment set up a committee, they will find that responsibility has been shelved not onto the committee, but on to the Government.4. As against these advantages the disadvantages are to my mind very much stronger. I would summarise them as follows:  (a) It would be almost impossible to find members to serve on a committeewho can approach the question of Sunday observance with an openmind. On the other hand, if the committee consists of persons whorepresent particular attitudes towards the question there is no hopewhatever of a unanimous report. In any case the issues involved are notquestions of fact which can be balanced one against the other, butmatters of personal conviction which are not susceptible to logicalargument.(6) If a committee is appointed by the Government, the Government will haveto accept some responsibility for deciding whether or not to implementits recommendations. The appointment of a committee, therefore, onlypostpones the evil day and will make the matter much more embarrassing-rassing to the Government when the committee reports.(c) The subject is not one which is appropriate for enquiry by a committeeappointed by the Government. This Bill does not raise any fundamentalquestion of Government, such as the maintenance of law and order,but matters of personal conviction and behaviour. If the Bill had never been introduced there would certainly have been no occasion for the Government to consider the introduction of legislation onthe subject.There have been three occasions in recent years on which previous governments have introduced legislation on this subject in 1932, when legislation was introduced to provide for legalising the Sunday opening of cinemas; in 1941, when a defence regulation was submitted to the House which would have permitted the Sunday opening of theatres and music halls; and in 1951 in connection with the Festivalof Britain (Sunday Opening) Bill. On all these occasions the Governments action was justified on the grounds that there was some special reason for the proposed amendment of the law. The legislation in 1932 was necessary because cinemashad, in fact, been opened in London on Sundays on a mistaken view of the law,and there had been a recent judicial decision that this was a contravention of the sunday Observance Acts. It was argued in 1941 that the opening of theatreswas desirable in order to provide entertainment for members of the Forces on sundays, and the opening of various sections of the Festival of Britain, includingthe Battersea Park Pleasure Gardens, was justified on the grounds that it was ofimportance to the success of the Festival of Britain. The 1932 legislation was passedwith considerable difficulty; in 1941 the Governments proposal was defeatedon a free vote of the House, and in 1951 128 Members voted against the opening ofany part of the Festival of Britain on Sunday and the proposal to permit theopening of the amusement section of the Pleasure Gardens was defeated on a free vote by 389 to 134.5. We must assume that the suggestion that a committee should be appointedwill be strongly pressed in the debate, and it is clearly important that the Govern-ment should not appear unduly unsympathetic to the wishes of the House. More-over, it would be unfortunate if the outcome produced a situation in which theGovernment appeared to have been unwillingly forced to agree to appoint acommittee. On the other hand, it does seem to me of the greatest importance thatthe Government spokesman should state clearly the difficulties about the appoint-ment of a committee and point out, in particular, that, unless the House is preparedto reach a decision on the general question of principle whether there should beany further substantial amendment of the laws relating to Sunday observance, thecommittee is likely to achieve very little. I suggest that we should take the line that it is for the House to indicate on the Second Reading of the Bill whether ornot they are in favour of any substantial amendment of the law. If the Bill is rejected on Second Reading the appointment of a committee would clearly be awaste of time. If it is passed by a substantial majority the best course would be. tosee whether it is possible during the Committee Stage to reach agreement ondetailed amendments in the law, which will clearly need very careful examination.
/If the debates in committee show that there is no likelihood of agreement being reached in the House on the form of the Bill, or if the House gives the Bill a SecondReading by so small a majority that there is little prospect of the Bill making anyprogress in committee, the Government will be prepared to consider the appoint-ment of a committee of enquiry. There would not be the same objections to theappointment of a committee in these circumstances, because the committee wouldbe working against the background of a decision by the House of Commons onthe general principle, and their terms of reference could be confined to examining the various forms of entertainment which might be permitted on Sundays and considering what safeguards are necessary in order to prevent abuse, what shouldbe the procedure for licensing, and matters of that kind.D. M. F.Home Office, S.W. 1,24th January, 1953.
