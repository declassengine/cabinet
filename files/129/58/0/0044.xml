secret cabinet the attached paper will be considered at tomorrow&apos;s meeting of the Cabinet under item 7 of the Agenda.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.4TH FEBRUARY, 19 53.
(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government secret.(53) 44 COPY NO.4TH FEBRUARY, 1953CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary to theMinistry of Labour and National service have consulted my Minister on the proposed increase in coal prices andwe are strongly of the opinion that, in view of its effect on the national economy,coal prices should not be increased at this time.    The trade union side of theindustry has admitted that more coal can be produced and has made an offer of Working Parties to increase productivity.    We suggest therefore that thisyear!s deficit or a wage increase should not be disposed of by passing it onto the consumer, but that we should hold it over the heads of the industry as thefirst item to be worked off by increased productivity.An increase in coal prices now means increases in prices of transport,gas, steel, bricks, etc. , which will be reflected through a wide range of homeand export prices, with a consequent increase in the cost of living.    As animmediate case in point I need only refer to paragraph 6 of E.A.(53) 23 oniron and steel prices.    The Governments action in asking that the miningindustry should this time work off its own deficit by its own efforts would bewell understood by the other unions and by the country as a whole, and wouldbe a useful form of continuing pressure on the mining industry to produce the extra coal which is well within its present capacity and to prevent further claims for increased wages.    We propose, therefore, that, if the Cabinet approve thiscourse of action, the maximum publicity should be given (i) to our reasons for not increasing coal prices, and (ii) to the fact that the deficit may have to bemet out of general taxation unless increased efforts on the part of the minerscan work it off within the next twelve months.H.W.Ministry of Labour and NationalService, S. W. 1.4TH FEBRUARY, 1953.
