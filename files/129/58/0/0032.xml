SECRET Cf\6   \ \   5%C.(53) 32 COPY NO.30TH JANUARY, 1953CABINETARGENTINE AND CHILEAN LANDINGS ON DECEPTION ISLAND(FALKLAND ISLANDS DEPENDENCIES)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesEncroachments by the Argentine and Chile in support of their territorialclaims in the Falkland Islands Dependencies have for some years been a matter of concern.     Our proposal to submit the dispute over title in this area to the Inter-national Court has not been accepted:  instead both these Governments have maintained bases at various points in the Dependencies.    Hitherto we have notjudged it desirable to use force to expel the intruders, but we have made repeatedprotests through the diplomatic channel without effect and have ourselves maintainedbases (organised by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey) as a means ofmaintaining and strengthening title by occupation.2.       A further encroachment has now occurred which, in my view, calls for amore emphatic reaction on our part.    On 24th January the Acting Governor of the falkland Islands reported that an Argentine party had erected a hut 400 yards south-east of the British base on Deception Island, in the middle of our party&apos;s footballfield and at the southern end of our light aircraft landing strip.    Formal protestsdelivered in accordance with standing instructions both by our base leader (who isa Magistrate) and by the Acting Governor, who visited the Island on 19th January,have had no effect.    Subsequently the Acting Governor reported that a Chileanparty had also started building a base some 500 yards west of the British base andon the side of our landing strip:  a local protest had been delivered by the Britishbase leader.    Copies of the Acting Governor&apos;s telegrams are attached as appendices ,AI and tB,m3.       Deception Island with its good harbour is the most important strategicpoint in the Falkland Islands Dependencies and in the past has been an importantcentre for whalers.    Although the advice of the law officers in 1947 indicated thata large part of the area of the Dependencies is in fact still res nullius and in someother parts our title is doubtful, their opinion was that there was very little doubtthat our title to Deception Island itself is valid.    Apart from South Georgia, thereis no part of the Dependencies where it is more important to maintain our title.This has already been challenged by the establishment of a base on the Island bythe Argentinians in 1947.     Their camp (which is permanently occupied) lies some three miles from the British base and they also maintain huts (at presentunoccupied) at two other points on the Island.    The Chileans have not hithertoestablished a base on Deception Island.4.       The latest Argentine move, by siting a base &quot;in our front garden&quot;, seemsto be deliberately provocative.    I feel sure that, if we do no more than protest atBuenos Aires, this will be regarded by the South Americans as proof that there isno point at which we shall resist their encroachments.    Indeed, if we cannotresist in such a flagrant instance and at a place where our greatest interests areat stake, we might as well abandon once for all our attempt to maintain our titlein the Dependencies.
5.       When the question of reaction to the 1947 landing was under considerationthree alternative courses were examined: -(1)    to take the initiative in an appeal to the Security Council;(2)    to use naval forces to assist the civil power in enforcingdomestic law;  and(3)   to use naval forces as such to expel the intruders.In the event, it was decided to adopt none of these but to make further attempts tosecure a settlement through the diplomatic channel.    The latter Jras,  however,been completely unsuccessful.    Appeal to the Security Council could be expectedonly to lead to inconclusive debate, in an atmosphere where political rather thanhistoric or legal arguments would carry weight and where we should have the anti-Colonial forces against us:  moreover, in this dispute we could not rely on thesupport of the United States, whose traditional attitude in the Antarctic has beenthat they neither make any territorial claims of their own nor recognise thosemade by other Powers.6.      As regards the use of naval forces, all three Governments in an exchange of Declarations in 1948 (renewed annually since) decided not to sendwarships into Antarctic waters south of latitude 60o apart from those movementswhich had customarily taken place in this area in past years.   Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have under the saving clause regularly sent a frigate to the antarctic during the summer season.   H.M.S. SNIPE (6-4 inch guns) is inthe area at present.   The Argentinians have two transports (lightly armed) ,a tanker and three hydrographic tugs (all unarmed) in the Antarctic, and theChileans have there one frigate (2 - 4 inch guns), one tanker (2 - 4. 7 inch guns)and two tugs (unarmed).   Thus, so far as actual warships are concerned, wehave a local superiority in gun-power.   The use of naval forces as such to expel the intruders might perhaps be regarded as putting us in the wrongif the matter is at any stage taken to the Security Council, and I shouldmyself prefer to use naval forces to assist the civil power in evicting theintruders under the law of the Dependencies and, if necessary, in enforcinglaw and order.   The Governor has powers under the Aliens Ordinance to detain and deport any alien if it is deemed to be conducive to the public goodto do so.   I suggest that the intruders be taken to the Falkland Islands for repatriation at the earliest opportunity to their respective countries.7.       There is a danger that such action by us in Deception Island will befollowed by reprisals against our bases at other points.   As these are isolated and unarmed (and I do not suggest that it would be appropriate to arm suchsmall parties of civilians for resistance), it would not be difficult for theSouth Americans to land armed forces in the neighbourhood of any of them if they so decide.   This situation can be considered if it arises, but it couldnot be more damaging to our interests than a supine acquiescence in what is,in effect, aggression in Deception Island.   It might be desirable subsequently to make it clear to the Argentine and Chilean Governments that, while we had hitherto not employed forceful measures against their bases elsewhere andwere not at present doing so, we felt that this landing in such close proximity toour base at Deception Island was an encroachment not to be tolerated.8.       I therefore request my colleagues&apos; approval of the issue of instructions with.M.S. SNIPE to assist the Magistrate at Deception Island with whatever force maybe necessary to secure the deportation of the recently landed Argentinian andChilean parties and the destruction of their new bases.   The arrangements for deportation would be as indicated in paragraph 6 above.   I suggest that thebest tactics would be to talcc action without making any previous notification to
the Argentine and Chilean Governments, leaving it to them to protest.Our answers would be that we were merely repelling an illegal incursionand that our offer to go to the International Court remained open.   Itwould probably be desirable to give advance information of the action proposed to the Governments of the &quot;old&quot; Commonwealth countries.O.L.Colonial Office, S.W.1.30th January, 1953,
Despatched 24th January, 1953 FIDEP No. 5On 14th January, Argentine tug CHIRIGUANO landed (? omission) and herpersonnel started erecting one prefabricated hut, a Polar tent and the Argentineflag approximately 400 yards south-east of a British base hut in the middle ofBritish football field and at the southern end of landing strip.    Base Leader handedprotest to Tug Commander the same day and received one in return.    Base Leadergleaned that the hut was permanent structure to be occupied during the summer months only by naval lieutenant, a civilian geologist and two naval other ranks.Hut completed 17th January.    I visited Deception on 19th January and immediatelysent further protest to Officer Commanding Argentine main camp in Port Fosterand invited him to discuss the matter.    He sent verbal reply that he was (corruptgrp.  ? civil authority) and the new hut and party purely a naval concern andcommanded by naval officer senior to him.    I accordingly addressed similarprotest and invitation to Officer Commanding the new hut party, but he was unable,or more probably unwilling, to meet me at the time suggested.    Suggest thatstrong protest be lodged with the Argentine Government requesting them to remove the new building and pointing out that siting of rival base so close to the Britishone and on land used for football field and air strip can only exacerbate feelingsand is liable to lead to incidents, particularly as Argentine boats now habituallyuse small landing stage in front of British hut to maintain the new base.    matter would appear particularly serious in view of our mooted air survey based onDeception.    Grateful Governor be informed.APPENDIX &apos;B&apos;TELEGRAM FROM THE ACTING GOVERNOR OF the falkland ISLANDSDespatched 26th January, 1953 FIDEP No. 6Further to my telegram Fidep No. 5,British Base Leader now reports that Chilean party have commencederecting building approximately 500 yards west of our base on the south-westside of the landing strip.    Protest has been delivered to the Commander of theTug LIENTUR and the matter is being further investigated.    Will keep youinformed.TELEGRAM FROM THE ACTING GOVERNOR OF the falkland ISLANDS
