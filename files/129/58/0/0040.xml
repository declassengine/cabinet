Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (53) 4031st January, 1953CABINETEXPORT OF ARMS:  SALE OF SPITFIRES TO SPAINNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs since July 1952 we have permitted the export to Spain of &quot;common-use&quot;material (i.e., material which can be used either for civilian or military purposes)and of obsolescent war material surplus to our own requirements and not needed by any North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Commonwealth or other high prioritycustomers.2. I now learn that there may be a market in Spain for up to fifty Spitfiresor sea fires. These aircraft, being surplus and obsolete, are covered by the existing policy. There are unlikely to be any other customers for them. In view of possibleParliamentary interest, I think my colleagues should know that I have agreed thatthe Ministry of Supply should explore the possibility of a sale of these aircraft to spain on condition that deliveries, which in any case could not begin until late in1953, would be suitably spaced out.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,31st January, 1953.43636
