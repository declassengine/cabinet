Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953SECRET &apos; Copy No.    6C. (53) 87th January, 1953CABINETATOMIC ENERGY  organisation memorandum by the Lord Privy SealAs requested by the Cabinet on 6th November (C.C. (52) 93rd Conclusions,Minute 5), the Minister of Labour, the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand I have reviewed the arguments for and against transferring,responsibility foratomic research and production from the Ministry of Supply to a non-departmental organisation. We have heard evidence from the Ministers chiefly concerned, from lord Portal of Hungerford and from senior officials with special knowledge of theproblems involved.2. On the detailed arguments advanced in support of the transfer (inparticular, the security argument and the claim that the existing arrangementsdo not provide sufficient flexibility of salary scales) we find that there is much to besaid on both sides. And, if the case for transfer had to rest wholly or mainly on those arguments, we might have had to conclude that it was not fully made out.3. In our view, however, the decision must rest on wider considerations thanthese. It is said that the harnessing of atomic energy will prove to be the mostimportant scientific development since the discovery of fire. The industrial useof atomic energy, it is true, still lies some years ahead; but it is coming, and its effects will be far-reaching. We cannot afford to be left behind in this race; forthe whole of our industrial future may turn on its outcome. We must thereforebe ready to entrust the development of this great discovery to whatever form of organisation is best adapted to exploit its vast potentialities to the full. No noveltyof organisation or difficulties of accounting procedure should be allowed to standin the way of this. It is, in our view, a matter of judgment not of detailed argu-ment whether one form of organisation or another is the better suited for this task. And our considered judgment is that the full potentialities of this new source of power are not likely to be realised if responsibility for its development remainswith a Departmental organisation, the heads of which must inevitably be pre-occupied with many other important problems. We believe that its industrialapplication will be more energetically and efficiently pursued if the responsibilityis transferred to an organisation which has no other concern except atomic energy and has a structure more akin to that of a large industrial organisation. The argu-ments in favour of such a form of organisation will become stronger as the need for closer contact with industry increases.4. We recognise that there are serious technical and Parliamentary difficulties to be overcome. It will mot be easy to give to an organisation which for many years ahead will have to be financed almost wholly by Exchequer money the freedom from detailed Parliamentary and financial control which is necessary in order tosecure for it the flexibility and speed of decision enjoyed by a large industrialundertaking. But Parliament may be ready to agree that, for a novel and vitalproject like this, unusual forms of organisation may be justifiable and appropriate.We consider that a determined attempt should be made to overcome these difficulties.43505
5. We therefore recommend that the Cabinet should now decide in principlethat responsibility for atomic energy development should be transferred to an appropriate form of non-Departmental organisation if means can be found ofovercoming the technical and Parliamentary difficulties involved and a satisfactoryform of organisation can be devised.The next step would be to appoint a small committee of experts to devise asuitable form of organisation and detailed plans for effecting the transfer. we agree that Viscount Waverley would be a most suitable chairman of this body.He might have with him someone with special experience of industrial organisa-tion Sir Wallace Akers, of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., would be asuitable choice and perhaps a retired civil servant.The preparation of a detailed scheme, the drafting and enactment of legislation,and the actual process of transfer will occupy a considerable time. It is not too soon to start and we recommend that the expert committee should be set to work as soon as possible. But it is possible that the transfer may not be completed within the life-time of the present Government. It would be wise, therefore, to try to enlist the support of the Labour Opposition for this plan in case it should fall to them to complete it. There seems no reason why this need become a matterof controversy between the Parties. Consultation with the Opposition could best be undertaken after the report of the committee of experts has been received.H. C.Gwydyr House, S.W. 1,7 th January, 1953.
