(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)-    secret, (53) 4 COPY NO,5th. January,, 1953,,^       . - CABINETICELAND FISHERIES dispute memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and FisheriesOn 18th December, 1952, the Cabinet invited me to have a discussionwith representatives of the fishing industry with a view to enabling KerMajesty&apos;s Government to inform the International Court that if the restrictionson our trawlers imposed by the Iceland    Government were raised pending a decision by the Courts the ban on landings of Iceland fish in this country would also be lifted (C.Ct,(52) 106th Conclusions, Minute 6).2,       The meeting was held at York on 30th December with representativesof the organisations of trawler owners, skippers and mates, and fish merchantsat the ports of Grimsby, Hull and Fleetwood;  representatives of the organisations of skippers and mates and of fish merchants at Aberdeenwere also present.   These are the four ports concerned with the Icelanddispute.   I was accompanied by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Scotland.3.       We gave a full account of the present situation, and made it clearthat the Iceland    Government were still showing themselves quite unyieldingdespite all the efforts of Her Majesty?s Government to negotiate a compromise settlement on the basis of the reference of the dispute to thePermanent Commission to be set up under the Ove rfishing Convention of 19460We explained that the Iceland    Government were not expected to budge fromtheir position        that the new fishery limits are to be permanently maintained and will not be made the subject of negotiation or arbitration on conservationgrounds, but will be insisted upon as being legally well basedtt4.       We said there were therefore three broad courses of action to beconsidered.   The first was for the present deadlock to be allowed to continue and for both sides to remain indefinitely in their present position.   Thiswould be difficult.   Public opinion was likely to apply increasing pressure forsome solution to be found, and such pressure would become very difficultto resist if the loss of the Icelandic supplies of fish should eventually leadto a shortage and high prices.   The second course would be to apply force,since persuasion had failed.   This would mean insisting upon the observance of the old fishery limits and protecting our trawlers up to those limits,with all the risks of coming to blows that would be entailed,   Such action could not, however, be contemplated:  Iceland was an allied member of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation and an important factor in Atlantic defence.The remaining course was to refer the dispute to the decision of theInternational Court of Justice.   This would be the more fitting as the Iceland    Government were now standing on supposed legal right rather thanon the ground of the conservation of the stocks of fish.   If the dispute were soreferred, the presentation and the hearing of the case would take a year ormore and during that time the whole matter would be j^bjtaxiice.   The questiontherefore arose whether private action on the part of the industry to ban the entry of Icelandic fish should not cease pending the judgment of theInternational Court.
50       If the Government should decide to refer the dispute to the Court,would the industry agree not to prevent as from the time when the disputewas referred to the Court, the entry of Icelandic fish through our fishingports and would the skippers and mates agree not to take strike action?We asked the representatives of the industry to recognise that the Britishcase before the Court might be better regarded if the industry withdrew their economic sanctions, even though Iceland should not take corresponding action by withdrawing to the old fishery limits while the dispute was sub judice06.       The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State and I then left therepresentatives of the industry to discuss the situation together.   Upon ourreturn we were given this statement of their unanimous view:&quot;We are prepared to have the dispute submitted to the permanent commision to be set up under the Overfishing Convention and toabide by the decision of that Commission provided that Iceland isprepared to do likewise.   Until the case has been decided by theCommission, the ban on Icelandic landings remains in force.In the interim period before the Commission meets, we areprepared to consider any approach which may be made by the icelandic interests. &quot;7,       I pointed out that this was no answer to the question which had beenput, and that the Foreign Secretary could not be expected to see any pointor advantage in putting to the Iceland    Government a proposal they hadalready completely rejected.   The representatives of the industry showedthemselves reluctant, however, to discuss the reference, of the dispute tothe International Court, at least at the present time, and they asked that ifpossible the Government should avoid going to the Court.   On being urgedfurther they said that they would readily remove their sanctions againstIcelandic fish if the Icelandic Government were willing to suspend theoperation of their new fishery limits until the Court gave judgment on thedispute;  but they were not prepared to remove their sanctions againstIcelandic fish if the Iceland    Government were were not so willing,,8.       I believe there are three factors determining the attitude of the industry.The first is a general feeling among the leaders of the industry that Icelandcannot hold out very much longer and will soon be obliged to seek a compromisesettlement,,   The second is that the fish merchants are evidently persuadedthat the risk of a shortage of supplies before this winter is out should be faced in the interests of the larger objective;  and the industry may be the moreready to take this risk because the supply position has been easy over thelast few weeks and there is some evidence that the demand for fish is not sokeen or strong as in recent winters.   The third factor is that the industry are clearly fearful of an unfavourable judgment from the International Court and ofthe possible consequences of such a judgment in limiting their access tofishing grounds adjacent to other countries.9.       The meeting concluded with our stating that Ministers would now have toconsider the situation in the light of what had transpired;  and the following statement for the Press was agreed and issueds-&quot;The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland today met representatives of the fishing industry at the ports of Grimsby, Hull, Aberdeen and Fleetwooda   Therepresentatives of the industry were informed of the situation with regardto the Icelandic fisheries dispute following the recent conversation withMr. Thors, the Icelandic Minister of Fisheries, which was the subject ofa statement by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs in the House of Commons on 17th December.   The present positionv/as fully reviewed, and Ministers were informed of the viewpoint of theindustry,, &quot;
