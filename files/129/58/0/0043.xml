Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.    5 7C. (53) 433rd February, 1953CABINETGOVERNMENT OFFICE ACCOMMODATIONMemorandum by the Minister of works in my memorandum of 29th July, 1952 (C. (52) 272) about economy in the useof office space I undertook to report progress again in six months.2. In Headquarters offices in London, Ministers have now agreed to surrender820,000 square feet of space, an area which roughly equals the combined office accommodation in the New Public Offices, Great George Street, the Home Office/Foreign Office block and the completed part of the new Whitehall Gardens building.Departments have already vacated about 400,000 square feet, of which 300,000square feet have been surrendered and 100,000 square feet are being used for other staff so that other requisitioned premises can be released.3. The release of a further 70,000 square feet is still under discussion. 40,000square feet of this are occupied by the War Office, who have not yet completed their plans.4. In regional and local offices, thanks to the co-operation of Ministers and departments, I hope to save more than I expected. My aim is to release 1,000,000square feet; 440,000 square feet have already been vacated of which 310,000 square feet have been derequisitioned or surrendered.5. It would cost about  15,000,000 to build new offices of an area equal to theamount it is now expected to release. The total saving on compensation, rent,rates, maintenance and services should exceed  1,000,000 per annum. I am par-ticularly glad to report that the Minister of Transport has agreed to work out a plan to surrender Ariel House, which should enable me to derequisition AdastralHouse, an expensive and unsatisfactory building.D. E.Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,3rd February, 1953.43664
