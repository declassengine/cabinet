Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953SECRETC. (53) 1412th January, 1953CABINETTHE ROYAL STYLE AND TITLES bill memorandum by the Home secretary i circulate for the information of my colleagues a draft of the Bill which Ihave had prepared to give effect to the alterations in The Queen&apos;s title made necessaryin the United Kingdom by reason of the decisions reached at the recent Common-wealth Conference.2. I thought it desirable that the Bill should place on record the basis of theagreement reached at last month&apos;s Conference and the preamble has been draftedaccordingly to present the measure partly as a. step which the United kingdom parliament thinks expedient and partly as a step imposed by the agreement atthe recent Conference.3. Clause 1 gives The Queen power by proclamation to adopt a new title.This follows precedent. But it departs from the precedents of 1901 and 1927 in not limiting the exercise of the power to a period within six months of the dateof the Royal Assent. The Commonwealth Governments and we intend to takethe necessary constitutional action to enable the various proclamations to be made simultaneously before the Coronation. It might, however, not be possible for this aim to be achieved and I see no real purpose in limiting the exercise of the powerto issue a proclamation under the Bill which arises from the recent agreement toa period of six months.4. My colleagues will notice that the power to issue a proclamation relates&quot; to the United Kingdom and all other the territories for whose foreign relationsHer Government in the United Kingdom is responsible.&quot; I have chosen that particular expression because it is a convenient way of describing the territories to which the change authorised by Parliament will apply. To attempt to be definiteor precise would require an exhaustive list and would create problems which itis unnecessary to raise.5. The Prime Minister stated in the House of Commons on .18th december that a State Paper would be laid before both Houses of Parliament shortly afterthe reassembly, and it is suggested that this should take the form of a White paper to be laid simultaneously with the presentation of the Bill. A draft White paper is attached.D. M. F.Copy No.    gHome Office, S.W.1,12th January, 1953.43536

DRAFT WHITE paper the TITLE OF THE SOVEREIGNThe existing form of the Royal Title is not in accord with current constitutionalrelations within the Commonwealth. In particular, it is incorrect in its referenceto Ireland and it fails to reflect the special position of the Sovereign as Head of theCommonwealth. Consultations have been proceeding for some time between the member Governments of the Commonwealth on the changes which might be madeto bring the Title into accord with current constitutional relations. These were brought to a conclusion by personal discussion between the Prime Ministers andother representatives of the Commonwealth countries who recently came to london for the Commonwealth Economic Conference. They concluded that, in the present stage of development of the Commonwealth relationship, it would be in accord with the established constitutional position that each member country should use for its own purpose a form of Title which suits its own particular circumstances butretains a substantial element which is common to all. They agreed that the various forms of the Title should, in addition to an appropriate territorial designation, have as their common element the description of the Sovereign as Queen of Her otherRealms and Territories and Head of the Commonwealth. It is contemplated that,subject to the will of Parliament and Her Majesty&apos;s Pleasure, the Title for use inthis country will be: &quot; Elizabeth the Second, by the Grace of God of the UnitedKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of Her other Realms and territories Queen, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith.&quot;All Commonwealth Governments will now take such action as is necessary ineach member country to secure the appropriate constitutional approval for the changes envisaged. In this country legislation amending the Royal and Parlia-mentary Titles Act, 1927, will be required, and a Bill has accordingly been introduced. When this legislation has been enacted and the corresponding con-stitutional steps have been taken in the other member countries, Her Majesty willbe advised to exercise her Prerogative power by the issue of Proclamations giving effect to the changes in all the Commonwealth countries concerned. It is hopedthat these may be issued before the Coronation.
