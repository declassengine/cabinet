(53) 17 Revise14th January, 1953CABINETEGYPT: DEFENCE negotiations memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs when the question of defence negotiations with Egypt last came before theCabinet in October (C.C. (52) 91st Conclusions, Minute 1) it was agreed that furtherstudies should be carried out as a matter of urgency with a view to finding a basisof fresh negotiations. Meanwhile Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo was warned that the studies were being carried out and was told if necessary to play for time.In point of fact the Egyptians have not broached the question of defence negotia-tions since then, being preoccupied with internal problems and with discussions with Her Majesty&apos;s Government over the Sudan.2. Discussions were held in London from 31st December to 7th January with united States diplomatic and military representatives regarding Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment^ proposals to the Egyptians on a defence settlement. On the UnitedKingdom side we took as our basis a Chiefs of Staff paper (D. (52) 50) approvedby the Defence Committee on 11th December (D. (52) 12th Meeting, Item 4). TheUnited States and United Kingdom representatives agreed on the papers annexedhereto covering a general settlement with Egypt, to comprise (a) a phased withdrawal of British armed forces from Egyptian territory;(b) the maintenance of a Canal Zone base in peace with a view to its immediateuse in the event of war;(c) an arrangement for the air defence of Egypt;(d) the participation of Egypt in a Middle East defence organisation; and(e) a programme of military and economic assistance by the United Kingdomand United States to Egypt.3. The most important result of these talks was an American undertaking,subject to the approval of their Government, to work for a settlement on the canal zone base as close as we can get to Case &quot; A &quot; in the Chiefs of Staff paper approvedby the Defence Committee. It was agreed that it was in the strategic interests ofboth countries to get as close as possible to a solution whereby a phased withdrawalof British forces from Egyptian territory would be accompanied by commitments on the Egyptian side to participate in a regional defence organisation in the middle east and to retain sufficient British technical aid to make possible the immediatere-activation of the Canal Zone base in the event of war. The United StatesGovernment would also work for Egyptian acceptance of an Anglo-Egyptian air defence organisation.4. The only serious divergence between the Americans and ourselves was over the supply of arms before the start of negotiations. The United States Govern-ment wanted to tell the Egyptians that they can have $10 million worth of military43535
equipment (a large proportion of which would be grant-aided) now, whereas westrongly impressed it upon them that we thought it would be a mistake to let the egyptians have any more lethal weapons until we were clearer whether they were going to co-operate or not. The United States representatives agreed to with-hold delivery of this equipment if Anglo-Egyptian relations became critical and infact little of it would leave the United States of America in the near future. I havetold the United States representatives that if the United States Government, inspite of our views, decide to release equipment to Egypt before negotiations start,at least I would hope that they would release not more than $5 million worthimmediately and only consider the further $5 million worth subsequently.5. The United States representatives made one important reservation, to theeffect that if Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Egyptian Government failed toreach a settlement over the Sudan, the attitude of the United States government towards defence negotiations would have to be reconsidered. Indeed, if the Sudantalks fail, the atmosphere so far may deteriorate as to make it impossible to startdefence talks. If on the other hand they are successful, we should start our defencetalks without delay.6. I suggest that, if the Cabinet approve the conclusions of the Anglo-American discussions, new instructions should be sent to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador to the effect that, at a moment to be agreed between Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government, he should start discussions withthe Egyptian Government in concert with his United States colleague. In accor-dance with our agreement with the United States representatives, the two Ambas-sadors would inform the Egyptian Prime Minister that we are willing to discuss ageneral settlement comprising the five topics listed in paragraph 2 above. Theywould indicate that if British troops are to be withdrawn from the Canal Zone it is imperative that alternative arrangements be made at the same time for the defenceof the Middle East as a whole and for this reason all the items comprising theproposed settlement should be treated as inter-dependent and discussed simul-taneously.  If the Egyptians accepted this, discussions would start.7. My colleagues will have noticed a number of menacing statements byEgyptians in authority about the renewal of guerilla warfare, if our troops are not withdrawn. I am convinced that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should not withdraw their forces from Egypt in the face of Egyptian threats and we must therefore show the Egyptians that, when we do withdraw, it will be because we consider it to be inour interest to do so. There can be no withdrawal of British troops from the canal zone until defence negotiations have been started and are seen to be progressingfavourably. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo is instructed to impress upon general Neguib and his colleagues that, if our negotiations are to have any resultat all, they must be preceded by a policy of self-restraint on the part of theEgyptian Government.8. If we can start negotiating on this basis and, with the co-operation of theUnited States, achieve a general settlement on the lines here agreed, there is somechance of achieving our objectives. If, on the other hand, we do not negotiate, butsimply stay put in the Canal Zone in the face of Egyptian opposition, we shallalmost certainly be confronted with a situation where the only alternatives will bethe military occupation of Egypt or an evacuation with np arrangements for thedefence of the Middle East and the international waterway to take the place ofthose at present subsisting.9. I attach at Annex copies of the papers agreed here with the american representatives.recommendations i therefore recommend that: -,(a) subject to final approval by the United States Government of the papersannexed, Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Cairo should be instructedto enter into negotiations for a general settlement with the egyptian government in concert with his United States colleague in the manner described in them at a moment to be agreed between Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the United States Government;
(b) there be no withdrawal of British troops from the Canal Zone until thethe negotiations have made a start, but that if the Egyptian Govern-ment agree to co-operate in a regional defence organisation and toprovide the means of re-activating the Canal Zone base in the time ofwar, we should start by the withdrawal of the combatant troops usedto reinforce the Canal Zone garrison when Egypt abrogated the 1936Treaty;(c) the old Commonwealth Governments, the Turkish and French Govern-ments, be informed of the action proposed.A.

ANNEXTOP SECRETHeld in London from 31st December, 1952, to 7th January, 1953The following papers have been agreed between the United States and UnitedKingdom sides, subject to the approval of their Governments.(1) United Kingdom Memorandum on defence negotiations with Egypt.(2) Memorandum on the proposed membership, functions, and structure ofthe Middle East Defence Organisation, together with a cover noteconcerning Egyptian participation in that organisation.(3) Memorandum on procedure for defence negotiations with Egypt.(4) Memorandum concerning the supply of arms to Egypt.(5) Memorandum concerning the possibility of according economic assistanceto Egypt.2. The two sides have agreed that paper No. 2 should be passed to the othersponsoring Powers of the Middle East Defence Organisation, and that their intentionto open defence negotiations with Egypt should be communicated to them.3. The two sides have also agreed that the North Atlantic Council shouldbe informed in advance of their intentions with regard to the supply of arms to egypt.4.   Agreed minutes of the meetings are being issued separately.Copy &quot;No. 170
united KINGDOM MEMORANDUM ON DEFENCE NEGOTIATIONSWITH EGYPTIntroduction1. The United Kingdom is proposing to negotiate with Egypt a settlement thatwould involve:  (a) Agreement over the Suez Canal base and an evacuation formula.(b) The participation of Egypt in a Middle East Defence Organisation.(c) A programme of military and economic assistance to Egypt.2. The participation of Egypt in M.E.D.O. is considered an essential part ofany settlement. Separate consideration is being given to the military and economic aid to Egypt that could be afforded by the United Kingdom, and it is understoodthat the United States are also considering this aspect. This paper is thereforeconfined to setting out the basis for negotiations over the Suez Canal base and to considering an evacuation formula.Middle East Strategy3. The strategic concept of the defence of the Middle East is that the Russianthreat should be met at the earliest possible moment on the frontiers between iraq and Persia. To implement this it is planned to deploy on the outbreak of warone British Division, two Arab Legion brigades and two Iraqi Divisions. these would be reinforced by approximately D + 6 months by two further british divisions, and by approximately D+ 12 months by a New Zealand Division and itis hoped by three Australian and one South African Divisions. The initial airdeployment is planned to be 192 aircraft rising to 294 by D + 6 months. There istherefore an urgent need for a working base in the Middle East that will be capableof supporting the Allied forces which it is planned to deploy.The Base in Egypt4. The base in Egypt took a period of 3^ years to build. In addition to work-shops, storage depots and installations for supply, repair and administration, it contains airfields, communications, power stations, hospitals and other amenities.The equipment at present in the base includes 700,000 tons of stores and14,000 vehicles. A map showing the lay-out of installations at present in use inthe Egypt base is attached at Appendix A, and details of Army and R.A.F. stores in depots in the Canal Zone are given at Appendix B. As a further indication of thescale to which these facilities have been developed, it should be noted that the totalcost has been of the order of  500 million.5. In addition to the installations outlined above, any base requires ports,transportation, communications and labour before it can function. Only in Egyptcan all the facilities be found on the scale required, and nowhere else in the middle east could existing facilities be expanded to form a substitute, except atprohibitive cost.6. There are two further important reasons why the base in Egypt should beretained. These are :  (a) With a &quot; back door &quot; to the Red Sea, Egypt is the only area in the middle east in which a base could continue to function if the Mediterraneanwere closed to through convoys, and if the Suez Canal were also closed.(b) The establishment of a substitute base elsewhere would take a considerable time. The defence of the Middle East would be seriously prejudicedif war occurred during the period between the closing of the Egypt base and the opening of a substitute.
to7. In addition to the requirement for a base in Egypt, Allied naval forces willrequire immediately on the outbreak of war, or when war appears imminent, theuse of Alexandria, Port Said and Suez; without these, naval operations in theEastern Mediterranean would be seriously handicapped.8. A working base in Egypt is essential to the Allies in war, and it cannotfunction except with Egyptian agreement and co-operation. In order to obtain this,and also the naval facilities that will be required, considerable concessions willhave to be made so as to secure Egyptian goodwill and promise of assistance in war.The Evacuation of United Kingdom Forces9. The rate at which United Kingdom forces are to be withdrawn from Egyptis likely to be a major issue. The present strength of the British troops in Egyptis 81,000 and their dispositions are shown in Appendix C. The rate of withdrawal isconditioned by the time required for:  (a) The removal of stores and equipment to alternative localities.(b) The establishment of a new Headquarters and Command Organisationincluding the extensive telecommunication facilities necessary.(c) The building of alternative accommodation for British personnel and storeswithdrawn from Egypt.Should agreement be reached and withdrawal started within the next few months itis hoped that the process will be completed before the end of 1954. Even so, forces will have to be accommodated in tents and a large number of families will have toreturn to the United Kingdom. Withdrawal would start as soon as possible afteragreement is reached and would be progressive throughout the period.Concessions to Egypt10. It is clear that negotiations with Egypt will have little chance of successunless requirements are kept to the minimum essential for the defence of the middle east. Appendix D lists three different cases illustrating the concessions that mayhave to be made and their implications. Case &quot; A,&quot; the optimum requirements, ismilitarily and financially by far the best, but Egyptian agreement is believed to be unlikely. Case &quot; B &quot; is worse, both militarily and financially. Should the Egyptiansprove completely intransigent Case &quot; C &quot; might have to be accepted although this involves the abandonment of any effective control over the facilities which are essential to the Allies in war and which the Egyptians are considered incapable ofmaintaining. Acceptance of Case &quot; B &quot; would therefore involve risks and delaybefore the Allied base could be made operational in war. The implications of case &quot; C &quot; would be very much more serious in that the Allies would not have a working base for at least 90 days after the outbreak of war.11. The above Cases are not meant to be inflexible. It may be that the egyptians will be prepared to accept some compromise between these, and we thinkthat we should stand fast where we can, and give way where we must, without neces-sarily attempting to obtain the requirements all at the same level.12. The defence of the Middle East and the support of Turkey&apos;s right flankdepend upon the co-operation of the other Arab States in the Middle East notablyIraq, Jordan, Syria and the Lebanon, as well as Israel. The need for facilities inthese States is a factor to be considered during negotiations with Egypt because itmay be difficult to secure from them anything more than is obtained from Egypt.13. In order to be able to support Allied operations in the Middle East in war from the outset, the facilities outlined in Case &quot; A,&quot; or a near approach thereto, willbe required. If these are not forthcoming interim maintenance facilities will be needed elsewhere than in Egypt to cover the period at the beginning of the war whilethe Egyptian base is being re-activated.14. In all cases the base would require some air defences early in a war. Weshould make no secret of our belief that the Egyptian Air Force could not do thisalone for many years to come. Case &quot; C &quot; is therefore unsatisfactory in this respect,but it is hoped that, with their participation in M.E.D.O., the Egyptians would indue course be induced to see sense.
Conclusions15. (a) The base in Egypt is essential to the Allies in war and it cannot functionwithout Egyptian agreement and co-operation.(b) An essential condition of any settlement with Egypt is the promise of full^ co-operation in war and membership of M.E.D.O. in peace.(c) Facilities are needed from Arab States other than Egypt and from Israel,but it may be difficult to secure from the former anything more than is secured from Egypt.(d) Negotiations with Egypt should seek to obtain the best terms possible,recognising that:  (i) Case &quot; A &quot; is the optimum requirement and every effort should bemade to obtain as many of its provisions as possible.(ii) Should agreement be reached and withdrawal started within thenext few months it is hoped that the process will be completed before the end of 1954.(iii) Case &quot; B &quot; would involve risk and delay before the base could bemade operational in war.(iv) The implications of Case &quot; C &quot; are even more serious and couldonly be accepted if the Egyptians proved completely intransigent.

FACILITIES REQUIRED IN PEACE AND WARPeaceCase &quot; A &quot;I. The Canal Zone would be handed over to Egypt and the base area wouldbe placed under Egyptian control. Within this base existing depots and installa-tions would be retained and would be run and controlled on the analogy of ourbase in Belgium or the United States base in the United Kingdom.2. The depots and installations would act as a working maintenance base fora proportion of the Middle East Land Forces in peace. The R.A.F. would not,however, carry out any maintenance from installations in Egypt in peace.3. The Royal Navy would retain equipment in Egypt for the defence of ports and maintain it under British supervision and have the use of the existing com-mercial oil storage facilities and pipe-lines.4. The Army would retain not more than 5,000 personnel to run theseinstallations and the R.A.F. not more than 2,000 for the same purpose.5. There would be an integrated Anglo-Egyptian Air Defence Organisation,including Headquarters, two British Day Fighter Squadrons and one British NightFighter Squadron, C. and R. Organisations, &amp;c.6.   An Allied-manned staging post would be maintained in Egypt.7. Implications. If the Egyptians could be persuaded to accept these con-ditions in peace-time, the Allies would be assured of having a working maintenancebase in peace to which they could return and operate immediately in war, andwhich would be protected by an efficient air defence system.Case &quot; B &quot;8. The base would remain in Egypt and be placed under Egyptian control.The Egyptians v/ould take over such depots and installations as the Allies wishedto retain in Egypt for war, assuming full responsibility for keeping all communica-tions, &amp;c, in working order and for maintaining allied war reserves and heavyworkshops in a state to be reactivated at short notice. There would also be someturnover of stores and equipment for use by the Middle East Land Forces in peace.9. In order to assist the Egyptians in their task a rather smaller number than under Case &quot; A &quot; of Allied supervisory and technical Army and Air Force personnel would be required.10. The Royal Navy would retain equipment in Egypt for the defence of ports and maintain it under British supervision and have the use of the existingcommercial oil storage facilities and pipe-lines.II. There would be an integrated Anglo-Egyptian Air Defence Organisation,including Headquarters, two British Day Fighter Squadrons and one British NightFighter Squadron, C. and R. Organisation, &amp;c.12.   An Allied-manned staging post would be maintained in Egypt.13. Implications-Under these conditions there would not be a fully satis-factory working base in Egypt in peace, but it should be possible to reactivate it within 60 days. Some stocks for the initial maintenance of Allied forces in theMiddle East in war would have to be located outside the Canal Zone.Case &quot; C &quot;14. The base would remain in Egypt, and be placed under Egyptian control.The Egyptians would assume the same responsibilities as for Case &quot; B &quot; (para-graph 8 above) except that there would be no turnover of stores and equipment foruse by the Middle East Land Forces in peace.
15. The right of periodic inspections of reserves and installations should beretained. The military personnel to carry out these inspections should, if possible,be stationed in Egypt. However, if the Egyptians were adamant that they wouldnot allow this, agreement might be given to Service personnel wearing plain clothesor to the use of civilians. Failing this it might be necessary to agree that inspectingpersonnel should be stationed outside Egypt and carry out periodic visits.16. The Royal Navy would retain equipment in Egypt for the defence of ports and place it under Egyptian supervision for maintenance, with the right of periodicinspection. They would have the use of the existing commercial oil storage facilities and pipe-lines.17. No R.A.F. units would be left in Egypt, but agreement could be givento seconding to the Egyptian Air Force some instructors and advisers. no guarantee of participation in the air defence of Egypt could be given, but agreement might be reached to send units in peace-time to take part in exercises with theEgyptian Air Force.18. The Allies would require the use of an Egyptian-manned staging post inEgypt and the necessary overflying rights for peace-time movements and training.19. Implications. In these circumstances, it is estimated that it would takeat least 90 days to reactivate the base. It would be necessary therefore to retainat least 90 days&apos; stocks for the whole of the Middle East Garrison in locations out-side the Canal Zone. In addition, the United States use of Abu Sueir and Faroukairfields in the very early stages of war might become impracticable since the equipment would not be adequately maintained there in peace-time.In War20. Under all cases the use of a working base in Egypt in war, together withEgyptian assistance and co-operation, is an essential requirement. In addition,allied Naval Forces will require the use of Alexandria, Port Said and Suez.21.   To obtain these facilities is the paramount object of the negotiations.
MIDDLE EAST DEFENCE ORGANISATIONCover NoteEgyptian Participation in M.E.D.O.Egyptian agreement to participate in M.E.D.O. is an essential part of the&quot;package proposal.&quot; The time-table which we contemplate is that, as soon asEgyptian acceptance of participation in M.E.D.O. is signified as part of the negotia-tions over the &quot; package proposal,&quot; approaches should be made to the other arab states * (if possible with Egyptian support) and to Pakistan t with a view to their participation in the Organisation. Should, however, the Egyptian government consider it desirable to consult the other Arab States before signifying their acceptance, there would be no objection. Indeed the United States and UnitedKingdom would be prepared on behalf of, or in co-operation with, the othersponsoring Powers to make a prior approach to these States in order to enablethe Egyptian Government to discuss the position with them on the basis that theother Arab States will equally have the opportunity to participate in M.E.D.O.Negotiations about the detailed arrangements for Egyptian participation inM.E.D.O. would meanwhile continue, and M.E.D.O. should be set up as soon aspossible, with Arab participation. The nature, extent and willingness of Egyptianparticipation in the joint defence of the Middle East would thus become evidentin practice well before the completion of the process of evacuating troops from egypt.2. The outline of the Middle East Defence Organisation in which the egyptians are to be asked to participate is contained in the enclosed memorandum,suitable as the basis of a paper to be handed to the Egyptian Government. Thisis based on the earlier United Kingdom memorandum, and incorporatesamendments suggested by the other sponsoring Powers.* Participation of Libya. It is agreed that this question should not be raised until after theconclusion of the Anglo-Libyan Bilateral Agreement.f Participation of Pakistan. It is agreed between the United States and the United kingdom that we should envisage the participation of Pakistan in M.E.D.O. at the earliest politically feasibledate.
MIDDLE EAST DEFENCE organisation the defence of the Middle East is vital to the free &quot;world and can be securedonly by the co-operation of all interested States. The establishment of a middle east Defence Organisation would assist and support the States willing to join in thedefence of the Middle East and develop the capacity of each to&apos;play its proper role in the defence of the area as a whole against outside aggression. Such an Organi-sation can be established by the general agreement of the States taking part, and need not be the subject of a Treaty, M.E.D.O. will not interfere in problems anddisputes arising within the area and in no way affects existing arrangementsrelating to such matters.Membership of M.E.D.O.It is proposed that M.E.D.O. should consist, in addition to the UnitedKingdom and Egypt, of Iraq, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the Yemen,the United States, France, Turkey, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. the six last named States have already signified their intention to participate. It ishoped that Egypt will join them and the United Kingdom in encouraging the above-mentioned Arab States to become members of the Organisation. Once these states have formed the Organisation, applications from other States to join the Organi-sation will be decided in accordance with the views of those States alreadycomposing it.The Functions of the M.E.D.O.The function of the Organisation will be to provide a centre of co-operativeeffort for defence purposes.   Initially, its tasks will be.:-(a) To draw up plans for the defence of the Middle East.(b) To plan for, and provide the Middle East States with, assistance in theform of training and advice.(c) To co-ordinate requests by Middle East States for arms and equipment.(d) To make plans for the operations in war. of all forces allocated for thedefence of the area in co-ordination with the adjoining N.A.T.O.Commands in the Mediterranean and Asia Minor.(e) To reduce such deficiencies as exist at present in organisation and capacity for the defence of the area, with particular emphasis on the need toensure that the Middle East States are made increasingly capable of themselves contributing to the defence of the area.Structure of the Organisation (The Organisation should be kept flexible and as small as is consistent with (a) the need for efficient planning;(b) the participation of a number of different countries;(c) a smooth evolution into a full command structure if and when the partici-pating States think this desirable.The Organisation would consist of:  (a) Military Representatives Committee.(b) Planning Group.Military Representatives CommitteeThe Military Representatives Committee would consist of representatives of all states participating in the Organisation. Its Chairmanship will rotate among the participating Powers. It will be responsible for the general direction of the planning Group and would meet twice a year, or more often if required.The Planning GroupThe Planning Group will be an integrated structure composed of officerssupplied by the participating Powers^ under a British chairman. .. The Group willbe divided into appropriate sections to handle, e.g., operations, plans, intelligence,administration and logistics,&quot; training, co-ordination of requests for military aid and equipment; liaison with no -participatihg Middle East States. ,&apos;(
UNITED  STATES/UNITED  KINGDOM &apos; TALKS  ON  EGYPTPROCEDURE FOR NEGOTIATING defence agreement with EgyptObjectives of the United Kingdom and United States governments. The Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States intend to enter into negotiation with the Egyptian Government in order to secure the voluntary association of Egypt with the West in arrangements for the defence ofthe Middle East against outside aggression. They will therefore propose a general settlement comprising:  (a) a phased withdrawal of British armed forces from Egyptian territory;(b) the maintenance of the Canal Zone Base in peace with a view to its immediate reactivation in the event of war (see Annex);(c) an arrangement for the air defence of Egypt;(d) the participation of Egypt in a Middle East Defence Organisation; and(e) a programme of military and economic assistance to Egypt.Tactics2. The negotiations would begin by the United States and United KingdomAmbassadors at Cairo informing the Egyptian Prime Minister that the two Govern-ments are willing to discuss a general settlement on the above lines, since they believe it to be in the interests both of the Middle East and of the Western Powers thatsuch a settlement should be speedily brought about. The Ambassadors would indicate that if British troops are to be&apos; withdrawn from the Canal Zone, it is imperative that alternative arrangements be made at the same time for the defenceof the Middle East as a whole. It is for this reason that all the items comprising the proposed general settlement should be treated as interdependent and discussedsimultaneously. Once this is agreed in principle, technical committees could beset up forthwith to deal with items (a), (b), (c) and (e) above.3. As regards item (d) (the participation of Egypt in the Middle East defence organisation) it is likely that the Egyptian Government will prove reluctant todiscuss it at all until arrangements for British withdrawal have been agreed, andwill not wish to discuss it in detail until the withdrawal itself has been completed.Nevertheless, a binding commitment from the Egyptian Government to join an organisation on the general lines contemplated by the Sponsoring Powers isessential, not only in order to avoid a vacuum in Middle East defence, but alsoto enable us to maintain our position in the other Arab States, and to justify thesupply of arms to Egypt; the British and United States Ambassadors should there-fore obtain the concurrence of the Egyptian Government in principle to participate in a Middle East Defence Organisation and at their discretion might hand to theEgyptian Government a paper on the lines of memorandum attached to paperNo. 2. They could make it clear, that if the Egyptian Government thought itdesirable first to consult the other Arab Governments there would be no objectionso far as we are concerned, and the United States and United Kingdom Govern-ments would be prepared themselves, on behalf of or in co-operation with thesponsoring Powers, to make a prior approach to these Governments in order toenable the Egyptian Government to discuss the position with them on the basis that the other Arab Governments will equally have the opportunity to participate in M.E.D.O.4. Attached as annex is additional guidance for the United Kingdomnegotiators on the base requirements under cases A and B of paper No. 1.5. The United States and United Kingdom Governments would be preparedto provide military aid on the basis of paper No. 4.6. Egypfs economic difficulties might also be reviewed by the United Statesand United Kingdom Governments with a view to seeing what economic aid could^e provided.
7. These secret exchanges should, if successful, result in the issue of threegovernmental communiques:  (i) by the United Kingdom Government stating their intention to evacuatetheir armed forces from Egypt by the end of 1954;(ii) by the Egyptian Government announcing their intention to enter a regional organisation for Middle East Defence, and to assume general responsi-bility for keeping the base in working order;(iii) by the United States Government publicly endorsing the positions takenby the United Kingdom and Egyptian Governments.
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE FOR UNITED KINGDOM NEGOTIATORSON UNITED KINGDOM BASE REQUIREMENTS IN CASES A AND b of PAPER No. 1.1. The base area would be handed over to Egyptian control. Within thisbase area the existing depots and installations would either:(a) be run and controlled by the British, employing both British and Egyptianpersonnel, on the analogy of other installations in. the N.A.T.O.organisation located in territory of another nation, such as the Britishbase in Belgium (case A), or(b) be run and controlled by the Egyptians, with the assistance of Britishtechnical maintenance and inspection personnel (case B).2. In both cases the depots and installations would act as a working base for the maintenance in peace of the Middle East Land Forces, but not of the R.A.F.3. In both cases the Egyptians would undertake to maintain in working order all the facilities and communications required for the operation of the base and ports in war, so that the whole base could be brought into full operation at short notice. The Egyptians would also be responsible for guarding all communication-tions, facilities, depots and installations and their contents.4. In case A, the Army would retain not more than 5,000 personnel to run the depots and installations and the RAF. not more than 2,000 for the same purpose.In case B there would be a lesser number of British personnel, but sufficient toensure proper technical maintenance and inspection.In both cases the British would undertake to train Egyptian maintenanceinspection and supervisory personnel with view to the gradual reduction in thenumbers of British personnel employed.5. In both cases the contents of the depots and installations would remain the property of the British, but all the buildings, communications, and facilities would be the property of the Egyptians.6. In both cases detailed discussions would be held between British and egyptian military representatives in order to determine the exact form of co-operation and to decide all other outstanding matters, such as the detailed application of the principle of ownership outlined in paragraph 5 above, thearrangements for inspection from time to time of the facilities, installations and stores remaining in the base area, and the arrangement for training Egyptiantechnical personnel.
SUPPLY OF ARMSThe two sides discussed the question of the supply of arms to Egypt. Theirviews are set out in the two papers at Annexes A and B.2.   From these papers it appears that the two sides are in agreement(a) that Egypt should be encouraged to look to her habitual sources of supplyof arms,(b) on the need for close consultation between the United States and theUnited Kingdom concerning the supply of arms to Egypt, and for close co-ordination of those supplies once negotiations with Egypt have started,(c) that consideration be given to the possibility of United States financial aid to Egypt for purchase of military equipment in the United Kingdom.3. The two sides differ on the advisability of making an immediate releaseof military equipment to Egypt before the opening of negotiations.
UNITED STATES POSITION ON EXTENSION OF MILITARY AID TOEGYPT1. The Governments of the United Kingdom and the United States are inagreement that the Government of General Neguib in Egypt affords the western powers their best opportunity of working out satisfactory arrangements for thecommon defense of the area, not only with Egypt but eventually with the otherMiddle Eastern States.2. The United Kingdom Government has concurred in the answer whichthe United States made to General Neguib on 6th October, 1952, in response tohis enquiry of 18th September, indicating that it was ready to examine the possibilityof extending material aid to Egypt, if Egypt for its part was ready to examine thepossibility of entering into arrangements with the Western Powers for mutualdefense.3. General Neguib in a Memorandum to the American Ambassador at Cairodated 10th November, 1952, indicated the willingness of his Government to considerthe eventual entry of Egypt into a system of Middle Eastern Defense with theWestern Powers, provided some solution could be found to the problem of Britishevacuation from the Canal Zone. With this communication he made formal request for military and economic assistance from the United States.4. The United Kingdom and United States Governments are in agreement that it is in their best interests to maintain the Neguib regime in power. GeneralNeguib has on numerous occasions indicated to the United States and UnitedKingdom Ambassadors in Cairo that, if he is to remain in power, he urgentlyneeds aid from the West. The only foreseeable force able to overrun GeneralNeguib would appear to be dissatisfied elements in the Egyptian armed services.The morale of the Egyptian services therefore is an important element in thesituation. He has made specific requests of the United States for military andeconomic aid which have thus far met with no response.5. The United States is convinced that an immediate interim response toGeneral Neguib&apos;s request for aid is essential not only to maintain the GeneraFsconfidence in the West but also to set the stage for the forthcoming negotiations between Egypt, the United Kingdom and the. United States for settlement of thedefense problem. Since it does not appear possible to formulate a programmeof economic assistance which could be carried out with any effect in the next fewmonths, it is the belief of the United States that an interim military aid programme is required. The military character of the present regime would seem to underscorethe importance of such a programme.6. In light of these circumstances the United States Government considersit most desirable to make available to Egypt arms and military equipment to the approximate value of $10 million, some of which might be furnished as grant aid.7. Arms and equipment in the $10 million interim programme of military aid would be selected from the list submitted in Annex I of the Egyptian memo-randum of 10th November, 1952, and would so far as possible, comprise arms andequipment which could not be used by the Egyptian armed forces in guerrilla orother armed attack on British troops stationed in the Canal Zone. -8. In informing General Neguib of the readiness of the United States imme-diately to make available the $10 million shipment of military equipment in additionto the million dollar order of so-called &quot; police equipment,&quot; the furnishing of whichhas already been agreed to by the United Kingdom Government, the american ambassador at Cairo would inform General Neguib that this step was taken asearnest of the friendly attitude of the United States and its desire to bring to a successful conclusion negotiations with Egypt which would place that country onthe side of the free Western Powers in some system for mutual defense of the middle east. The Ambassador would make it clear that the United States would not makeany additional shipment of equipment to Egypt unless definite progress had beenmade in the negotiations.
9. The position of the United States Government with respect to any futureprogrammes for military assistance for Egypt is that such programmes will have tobe carefully co-ordinated with the progress made in obtaining Egyptian adherence to participation in a system of common defense planning. The scope and natureof United States assistance will therefore depend in the future in large measure on egyptian performance, and on the general question of area relationships.10. While the United States cannot agree that such a policy should excludeEgyptian procurement from the United States, the United States will continue as amatter of policy to impress upon General Neguib and his Government that theUnited States will expect Egypt to look to its habitual sources of arms supply.The United States would also be prepared to consider the possibility that its military assistance to Egypt might in part take the form of material of British type purchased by the United States in the United Kingdom for transfer to Egypt. The UnitedStates will, of course, undertake to maintain close consultation and co-ordinationwith the United Kingdom insofar as possible in the formulation of any armsprogramme.
Annex B to Paper No, united KINGDOM POSITION ON EXENSION OF MILITARY aid to EGYPTSince October 1952 both the United Kingdom and the United States havemade available, as an exception to the embargo which had been in force for thepreceding twelve months, relatively small quantities of military equipment to Egypt,little of which has actually arrived there yet. The main purpose of these consign-ments was to give political support to General Neguib&apos;s regime.A. In the Immediate Future2. The United Kingdom Government are firmly opposed to the release ofany further equipment except in the course of defence negotiations, for the following reasons:  (a) While the United Kingdom realise the necessity for building up an atmosphere of confidence between the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates on the one hand and Egypt on the other, experience over therelease of jet aircraft to Egypt does not lead them to suppose that anyfurther releases of military equipment would have this effect.(b) In the light of recent statements by a member of the Egyptian HigherMilitary Committee and a member of the Egyptian Governmentthreatening renewed guerrilla activity in the Canal Zone failing thewithdrawal of British troops, it will be difficult for the United KingdomGovernment to be certain that any military equipment supplied to egypt will not be used against British forces. Moreover, it will be practically impossible to convince Parliament and public opinion in theUnited Kingdom that it will not be so used.(c) The Government of Israel have already shown marked concern over therecent supplies of jet aircraft from the United Kingdom to Egypt andother Arab States. The Arab States maintain that a state of war stillexists between themselves and Israel, and some of their leaders makeprovocative statements from time to time. Any supplies would be attacked by the Israeli Government as potentially for use against them-selves and it would be difficult to justify them except as part of a defencesettlement.(d) Any substantial supplies to Egypt before the opening of defence negotia-tions would increase the pressure by the remaining Arab Governments,as well as Israel, for further arms supplies without commitment to theWest.   Other countries might take a similar attitude.(e) Substantial release now by the United Kingdom or the United States to egypt would make it more than ever difficult to restrain the north atlantic and other friendly Powers from bringing their own embargoesto an end. This would mean that Egypt could obtain immediatedelivery of very large quantities of modern armaments, including small arms and ammunition, which Egyptian purchasing missions have sought to obtain from these countries over the past few years.(/) The West would therefore have thrown away what might otherwise havebeen one of its most potent bargaining levers in the negotiations with egypt.3. It would, in the United Kingdom view, have a particularly unfortunate effect on the United Kingdom position in Egypt if the United States were to makea substantial release of arms to Egypt now because:  (a) Despite the United States statement that further United States shipments of arms would not be made until progress had been achieved in thenegotiations, the Egyptians would tend to believe that in the last resortthey would be able to obtain more from the United States and wouldbe to that extent less convinced of the need for a settlement with theUnited Kingdom.(b) It might tend (contrary to the long-term aims of both Governments) to divert Egypt from looking to the United Kingdom as her habitualsupplier of arms.
(c) It would be unfortunate if the United Kingdom and the United states representatives had to give evidence in the North Atlantic Council ofa difference of opinion on such a vital point as the supply of arms inadvance of negotiation. -B. After the Opening of Defence Negotiations4. When negotiations have started the United Kingdom Government proposeto release equipment to Egypt in phases. The timing of each phase would dependon the course of negotiations. It would also depend on the availability of the equipment concerned (some of the known Egyptian requirements could, if supplied from United Kingdom sources, only be provided at the price of some detriment to united Kingdom and Allied forces). The most important items would be withhelduntil an agreement was reached.5. The enclosure to this paper shows how the equipment now on order byEgypt from the United Kingdom would fit into these phases. Equipment of the types detailed in phase A would be released on the decision of the supplyingGovernments when they felt fairly confident of Egyptian participation inpreparations for regional defence. Equipment in Phase B would be released when a settlement was reached, and this would be tantamount to a complete lifting ofthe arms embargo.6. It is by no means certain that the Egyptians will require all of the equipmentshown in the annex, some of which has been on order for a long time. At asuitable moment they would probably be invited to submit an up-to-date list,which would then be divided into similar phases.7. The above policy would be entirely ineffective if other Governmentssupplied arms to Egypt without conforming to it.
Enclosure to Annex B to Paper No. 4PHASING OF UNITED KINGDOM EQUIPMENTThere are two criteria for deciding which types of equipment should come intoeach category:  (a) The extent to which a particular type can be used against British forces inthe Canal Zone.(b) Their usefulness and attractiveness in the eyes of the Egyptian Government.2. Existing orders from the United Kingdom have been divided into twophases. Supply of equipment under these phases would be adapted to Egypt&apos;present requirements. The major items in the phases are:  ARMY EQUIPMENTPhase A(i) Some static 3-7 inch anti-aircraft guns.(ii) Spare parts for Centurion tanks already held by the Egyptians,(hi) Wireless sets from War Office stocks.(iv) One or two radar sets Mark III.Phase B(i) Centurion tanks Mark III and armoured cars (these could be suppliedwithout detriment to the active forces but at some detriment to the firstcontingent of the Territorial Army).(ii) Machine guns, with some small arms and other ammunition, from WarOffice stocks.The equipment in these phases would be drawn in roughly equal proportions fromthe trade, from the new production and from War Office stocks. The total estimated value of requirements so far made known by the Egyptians to the UnitedKingdom Government is some 8 million pounds of which the Egyptians havealready made down payments to the value of 1 million pounds.AIR FORCE EQUIPMENTPhase A(i) The remaining jet aircraft and components already ordered, as follows:  12 Meteor Mark VIII Fighters22 Vampire Fighter Bombers16 Vampire Night Fighters(ii) 21 Spitfires for which the Egyptian Air Force recently enquired.(iii) Further components and parts for production of Vampire aircraft.Phase B(i) Ammunition and armament spares now on order, for existing aircraft ofthe Egyptian Air Force.(ii) Any new orders for jet aircraft and for armament spares.The value of the above equipment (excluding (ii) in Phase B) is about  3 millionsterling.
ECONOMIC assistance the two sides have exchanged views on the possibility of giving some economic assistance to Egypt. This question is still under consideration by the Governmentdepartments concerned in Washington and London, and no conclusions have yetbeen reached. It appears unlikely, however, that it will be possible for. either government to accord assistance on a scale large enough to have much effecteither in strengthening the position of General Neguib&apos;s Government in Egypt orin affecting the Egyptian attitude to the United Kingdom defence proposals setforth in paper No. 1. Such assistance as it may be possible to give would onlygo a very small way towards alleviating Egypfs economic crisis, and would be inno way commensurate with the request recently put forward by Egypt to theUnited States for $100 million, and for assistance in the supply of wheat.United States Position2.  The United States Government are considering(a) the Egyptian request for assistance to the value of $100 million for certaindevelopment projects,(b) assistance in supplying all or part of Egyptian wheat import requirementsof 800,000 tons.3. The possibility of buying Egyptian cotton for the United States stockpilehas also been considered, but does not appear feasible. It may however be possiblefor the Defence Department to arrange for an increase in purchases to the extentof about 14,000 bales of cotton (value about $5 million) through commercialchannels during 1953 to meet current defence needs. This amount would however be too small to have any appreciable effect on the Egyptian cotton crisis.4. As regards proposal (a), the United States Government are increasing thescope of the industrial survey mission now in Egypt under Point 4. This missionmight review existing Egyptian development projects and perhaps recommend oneor two projects which could be put into effect in the near future.5. The search for other ways in which the United States might give someeconomic aid to Egypt will continue.United Kingdom Position6.   The United Kingdom Government has considered(a) the possibility of buying Egyptian cotton for the United Kingdomstockpile;  .(b) a special release to Egypt from her blocked sterling balances.7. Both courses present great difficulties, and, while Ministers have not. yet reached a final decision, it is most unlikely that Her. Majesty&apos;s Government could give economic assistance to Egypt in these (or other) ways.
