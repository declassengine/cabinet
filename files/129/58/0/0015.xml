Printed for the Cabinet.  January 1953SECRET Copy No. jC. (53) 1510th January, 1953CABINETPERSIANote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, the annexed report receivedfrom the U.S. Embassy in London of a meeting between the U.S. Ambassador atTehran and Dr. Musaddiq on 8th January.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,10th January, 1953.annex. This evening (8th January) I had another talk with Musaddiq. I told him that I thought that the conversations in London were resulting in considerable progress and I hoped that there would be some concrete developments soon. Heinquired about the terms of reference and I replied that I thought this question wasunder study. He said that he did not see any reason why such study should be prolonged; he was agreeable to using British law as a basis. If the suggestions which he had made were not acceptable, he might as well be told. I foundMusaddiq in one of his depressed moods; he voiced a fear that the British were merely using up time with talk at the same time that they were attempting to under-mine his Government in various ways. I told him that if he went on permittinghimself to be obsessed by such suspicions, no progress would ever be made. Thewhole problem constitutes a matter of great importance to the United Kingdom,and they cannot afford to make snap judgments. I inquired whether he would go on holding the United Kingdom responsible in Iran for disagreeable incidents in case a settlement of the oil problem in a spirit of goodwill should not be possible.He was insistent that he personally liked the British as a people, but that he wasdistrustful because of past British policies regarding Iran. If the oil problem shouldbe settled and if he were convinced that the British were decided on a friendly and fresh approach toward Iran, then he would be happy and among the first to acclaimthem as friends. However, he could not see much hope that a development ofthis kind would materialise.2. I inquired whether Musaddiq was really interested in assuring that his country would have steady overseas markets over a period of years for its oil. Heresponded that he naturally was interested; unless Iranian oil returned to world markets, there would be no solution of the oil problem. It is necessary to havea steady market if large quantities of oil were to be sold. Iran must be assured ofenough oil exports to permit economic planning. I said that both in the UnitedStates and the United Kingdom there was some concern that after an arbitration and United States Government purchase agreement had been concluded and afterIran had obtained substantial advanced payments, that Iran then would not have43533
much interest in negotiating a long-term commercial sales agreement with an inter-national company; that under such circumstances there would be no means bywhich Iran could pay compensation; and that after a period, of several months,Iran again would be in a desperate economic situation. Musaddiq was insistentthat as soon as possible after the arbitration and United States purchase agree-ments had been concluded, he would like to enter negotiations with an internationalcompany. I said that if he would be willing to make some kind of a formal under-taking when he signed the other agreements, it might make the arbitrationagreement more acceptable to the British public. He said that we could give theBritish the following assurance:  &quot; He would be prepared at time of signing arbitration and United Statespurchase agreements formally to undertake to enter into negotiations with aninternational company in which A.I.O.C. was participant looking towardsconclusion of an agreement to sell to that company definite amount of crude oil and oil products annually over fixed period of years.&quot;Musaddiq did not write this down in his notebook, but, during our conversa-tion, I repeated the formula on several occasions and each time he confirmed myrendition. I hope that the British will find this statement satisfactory at this stage.3. At the end of our talk, I asked Musaddiq about the present status of theMarcus contract which he had mentioned in an earlier conversation. Musaddiqreplied that he feared Marcus had not been entirely frank with him. Marcus had told him that he had an enormous amount of private capital in back of him andthat he would by 3rd January be able to place $50 millions in deposit in a bankas a revolving credit for Iran and as a guarantee for the purchase by his company of 7 million tons of oil per year. Now, however, he is receiving telegrams fromMarcus which contain various explanations for his failure to make good hispromise. Musaddiq had therefore reached the decision that it was better not tobother with Marcus any more. He added that he had been doubtful of Marcus&apos;ability to make good, but that he had decided to give him a chance in view of hispersuasiveness and plausibility. He had refrained, however, from giving a signedcontract to Marcus. From these and other remarks, I gained the impression thatMusaddiq no longer had any confidence in Marcus.
