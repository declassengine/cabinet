Printed for the Cabinet.   January 1953CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.C. (53) 76 th January, 1953CABINETTHE MARQUESS OF READINGS MISSION TO SOUTH AMERICAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs think that my colleagues may be interested to read the attached abridgedversion of Lord Reading&apos;s reports on his goodwill mission to South America. Somenotes by Mr. Barclay of the Foreign Office, who accompanied Lord Reading asfar as Lima and went on to visit some of the countries which Lord Reading was unable to cover, are also included.I have received a number of tributes to the way in which Lord Readingcarried out this arduous mission, and I think that we owe him a debt of gratitude.It is clear that a visit from a member of Her Majesty&apos;s Government was verywelcome in all the countries he was able to visit, but the success of the tour wasprincipally due to Lord Reading himself.A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,6th January, 1953.43493b
ANNEXExtracts from Lord Reading&apos;s ReportsI left London by air on 9th November, accompanied by Mr. Barclay, theForeign Office Under-Secretary in charge of Latin American affairs, and by myPrivate Secretary. We arrived at Rio the following day, and after three full daysthere flew on to Montevideo, where we arrived on the evening of 14th November.We proceeded by flying boat to Buenos Aires on 17th November, and flew on toSantiago three days later. On 23rd November, we flew to Lima, where we spentour customary three days. I left on the evening of 26th November and flew viaPanama, Miami, San Francisco and Manila to Singapore in order to attendMr. MacDonald&apos;s Annual Regional Conference at Bukit Serene. I finally, got backto London on 12th December, having flown over 35,000 miles in the course of&apos; the thirty-three days.I attach some notes on the five South American capitals which I visited,together with a note on a conversation with Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to Bolivia,who came down to meet us at Santiago, and a brief supplementary report byMr. Barclay, who on leaving Lima travelled via Quito and Bogota to Caracas and washington and so home.IRio de JaneiroI encountered in Brazil the greatest friendliness and courtesy and found bothpublicly and privately nothing but expressions of sincere goodwill towards Britain.I was received both by the President, to whom, in accordance with Her commands,I conveyed Her Majesty&apos;s greetings, and by the Acting Foreign Minister, SenhorBrandao (the Foreign Minister himself being absent at the United Nations assembly in New York), to whom I handed the Secretary of State&apos;s letter. I was also invitedto attend a session of both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies, at each ofwhich a speech of welcome was made and I duly replied. I visited the premisesof the &quot; Cultura Inglesa &quot; and had a meeting with the Executive Council of theBritish Chamber of Commerce, after which I addressed a large gathering of their members at luncheon.I spent half an hour with the President, who was most cordial and conversedin French, which he speaks fluently but, I gather, only on special occasions. our conversation was of a general kind but the President referred to the long tradition of friendship between our countries and of the mutual advantage of trade betweenthem.The Acting Foreign Minister had nothing of particular interest to say, but heis a sick man as well as being only a &quot; locum-tenens,&quot; though he has in the pastheld the office of Foreign Minister himself. He did, however, give a large officiallunch for us in the Foreign Office, at which at the end of a speech praising GreatBritain for her political institutions he proposed the Queen&apos;s health. I replied tohis speech and proposed in my turn the health of the President.The British Chamber of Commerce have been facing great difficulties and theyhanded me a memorandum setting out their problems. The two points about whichthey were most concerned were (1) the need to break down the obstacles to Anglo-Brazilian trade and (2) the injustice under which they were suffering due to theBritish Inland Revenue&apos;s insistence upon their paying Income Tax upon the profitswhich they had earned but were unable to remit.IIMontevideoI think that my main comment upon my visit to Uruguay would be that somuch goodwill alrdady existed towards this country that my purpose was rathergratefully to acknowledge it than to endeavour to stimulate it. I found on everyside evidences of genuine affection and respect for Great Britain, and proudmemories of the part that they had played in helping us during the war, particularlyin dealing with the casualties after the battle of the River Plate. I was there during a week-end when there is not normally much activity, but the President of the
National Council, who was President of the Republic until the inauguration ofthe new system and is an elderly man, took the trouble to come back five hundredmiles by air from an engagement in the provinces in order to be present at the ambassador^ dinner in my honour, and the Ambassador informed me that manyof the leading personalities had gone out of their way to abandon their normal practice of being absent from Montevideo on Saturday and Sunday in order tohave an opportunity of meeting me and thus showing their sentiments towardsGreat Britain.I may perhaps record one of the more trying experiences of my tour whenthe President of the Senate arranged what was officially described as a &quot; whiskyde honor&quot; and involved the circulation of large trays, first of Uruguayan sweetchampagne and then of practically undiluted Scotch whisky at the extremelyunpropitious hour of ten o&apos;clock in the morning. But it appears that whisky isthe Uruguayan national drink and that they are frequently and deeply thirsty.It is, however, no doubt admirable from the point of view of British export and,remarkably enough, appears to do them nothing but good. The situation wasnot improved by my having, immediately afterwards, to make an appearance onthe films for the local news-programme.IllBuenos AiresThis was the part of my mission to which I had looked forward with some slight apprehension in view of various happenings in the recent past. But I needhave had no fears, for throughout the three days everyone from the Presidentdownwards was most friendly and courteous and eager to assert his desire for greater friendship between the Argentine Republic and Great Britain. Exceptfor a foolish question by one journalist at my press conference, &quot;Las Malvinas&quot;might have been thought not to exist.My time in Buenos Aires was even more fully occupied than anywhere else,which was in part due to the presence of so large a British community and inpart to the necessity of going to inspect various institutions of the FundacionEva Peron, which were in many ways remarkable, not least for the prodigalscale of the expenditure upon them.The atmosphere amongst all those whom I met was unexpectedly cordial.The Ambassador was greatly surprised when five or six Ministers attended hiscocktail party, a type of function at which they are very rarely present, and, indeed,he said that he had never before known them to accept an invitation of any ofthe Western Powers on such an occasion. Moreover, the Minister for ForeignAffairs and the Intendente (Lord Mayor) of the city were present at the BritishChamber of Commerce luncheon, at no function of which any Minister hasattended for a long time past, and I was informed by a number of the leadingBritish business men that it would have been impossible if the Senora had stillbeen alive. Their view was that she would have immediately vetoed the Ministers&apos;attendance and that they would have been obliged to comply. This is oneinstance of the general opinion expressed by them that.a process of change was going on and that the Argentine Government had now decided, after seekingalternatives in many quarters, that in the end they could not do without their trade with Great Britain and were consequently anxious to foster good relations.Although this change of policy had not been the result of the Senora&apos;s death, itcould not have been carried out if she had still been alive.I spent some forty-five minutes with President Peron in an atmosphere of greatfriendliness and informality, accompanied by coffee and cigarettes. He was extremely cordial and forthcoming, and I was very much struck by the differencebetween the representations of him in many mediums which are displayed all overBuenos Aires and show him as the strong, stern, almost Mussolini-like dictatorand the actual man with whom I found myself conversing. The chief impressionhe makes upon one is of immense vitality and physical well-being, together witha quite unexpected boyish streak. He talked a great deal about all sorts of subjects,made a number of jokes, roared with laughter at them all, and winked vigorouslyat the company to show that he was about to say something funny. He insisted that we should be photographed together and at the end of our interview escortedus to the door arm-in-arm with the Ambassador and myself.43493
He was obviously surprised and as obviously deeply gratified when I told him that I had been commanded by Her Majesty to convey Her greetings to him.;and within an hour the fact that those greetings had been conveyed appeared onthe front page of the Buenos Aires press. It may to some extent have undonesome of the damage to Anglo-Argentine relations which, according to all localaccounts, resulted from the Senora&apos;s bitter resentment at not being received inEngland as a Royal personage during her European tour in 1947.The press, which is, of course, with one exception wholly under the controlof the Government, was particularly expansive about my visit and gave it very wide publicity both in letter-press and pictures, even reporting in full a 20-minutespeech which I made at the British Chamber of Commerce luncheon.IVSantiagoThis city impressed me as being the most attractive place in which to live ofthe four capitals that we had so far visited. Certainly nothing could be morespectacular than the approach to it by air from Buenos Aires. The Andes at thispoint fall almost sheer down to the Pacific plain; there are no foothills and as one emerges from the mountains the whole panorama is suddenly spread out below. I found the Chileans most agreeable and they were very kind and hospitablethroughout our stay, assuring us at every opportunity of their deep regard forGreat Britain and their veneration for its institutions.The programme followed in the main the same lines as in the other capitals.The President was most appreciative of Her Majesty&apos;s greetings and theForeign Minister of the Secretary of State&apos;s letter. The President certainly doesnot look his 75 years. He has some resemblance to Hindenburg, though on a rathersmaller scale and with a far more genial manner and expression. He strikes oneas basically the simple soldier, firm and direct, though not without an admixtureof guile. I was assured on all sides that he had abandoned his leanings towardsdictatorship and was prepared to behave as a good democrat (Latin Americanpattern).The Foreign Minister, Senor Olavarria, is not an impressive figure at first sight,being very short and not of particularly distinguished appearance, but he improvesgreatly on further acquaintance.He was very friendly and anxious to be helpful and at the luncheon which he gave for me he made a brief speech which was excellent in manner, form and content and was incidentally the first speech of welcome since our arrival in SouthAmerica to be spoken without notes and not read word for word.VLimaLima is the one city which I visited on my tour which possesses an historicalbackground, the character of which has been on the whole scrupulously preserved(except for a few sky-scrapers) in its recent rapid expansion.I was received everywhere with the greatest cordiality, and assurances ofaffection for Great Britain were general. My programme at Lima did not differmaterially from the usual routine, except that the President himself gave a dinnerparty of some seventy guests in my honour in the very spacious and handsomePresidential Palace. It was extremely well done, with great dignity and efficiency,but without undue formality or ostentation.The President makes a very good impression. He is a soldier, but by generalagreement he has no leanings towards dictatorship. He is said to be extremelyintelligent and a very hard worker, with clear and decided views on the many topicswith which he is called upon to deal.(The absence* of anyone corresponding to a Prime Minister in any of thesecountries, except Peru, inevitably throws a very heavy responsibility upon the presidents, who have not only to discharge the ceremonial duties but to makedecisions on a very large number of miscellaneous matters.)The Foreign Minister, Don Ricardo Rivera Schreiber, is of course an oldfriend. He is striving to reorganise his Ministry and finding it a considerableproblem, not least because it is housed in a very lovely but utterly unsuitable early
s17th century Spanish colonial palace. He made no secret of his intention, notonly to head the Peruvian delegation to the Coronation, but also to return toLondon as Ambassador at the first opportunity.VIBoliviaHer Majesty&apos;s Ambassador gave us a graphic account of the unsettled stateof affairs in Bolivia since the revolution which brought the present regime into power last April. Large quantities of arms are in the possession of the miners andthere has been a general disintegration of law and order. Since the nationalisation of the three great tin-mining companies, and in the light of the chaotic conditionsnow prevailing, the foreign technicians have mostly thrown in their hand, andit is very questionable whether production can be maintained. If exports of tinconcentrates do not begin to move, Bolivia will soon lack foreign exchange withwhich to pay for the necessary imported food-stuffs, and a complete breakdownwould be the likely result. Until conditions become more stable the future ofthe contract whereby the Williams Harvey Company obtain tin concentrates fortheir smelter at Bootle must remain in doubt. The prospects of the two British-owned railways, which have hitherto been doing quite well, are equally uncertain.VIIConclusionsSo far as I personally am concerned, my tour was a most stimulatingexperience, for I met everywhere nothing but repeated expressions of admirationfor, and goodwill towards, Great Britain. These sentiments were not only pro-claimed on official occasions, but were at least as warmly conveyed in provate conversations.The reference to Latin America in the Speech from the Throne has arousedkeen interest and I think that, provided that it is speedily followed up by the promised &quot; active measures,&quot; my mission, following as it did upon the highly successful visit of the Canberras, was happily timed. (Incidentally, I heard loudpraise of Air Vice-Marshal Boyle in every country. He made an admirablepersonal impression.)If I may conclude by summing up my main impressions, they are that (i) there is an immense wealth of goodwill towards, and confidence in, GreatBritain in all the five countries not excluding the Argentine, where itis by no means confined to the Anglo-Argentine community, though itis naturally strongest amongst them;(ii) there is a very real desire to see trade with Great Britain maintained and expanded, and to find ways round the obstacles which have causedso much frustration in the recent past;(iii) there is far too common a tendency in Great Britain to regard latin america as a homogeneous unit, whereas there are immense differences between all the countries, each one of which has an entirely separate and distinguishable individuality of its own.Manufacturers in England who desire to increase their exports tothis part of the world must get out of the habit of talking in general terms about &quot; the South American market &quot; and must concentrate uponthe particular needs and tastes of each country and find these out by sending highly qualified Spanish-speaking travellers, bringing cataloguesin Spanish and with prices expressed in the local currency, to investigate the requirements on the spot. They should remain for a reasonable time in each country and thus inform themselves thoroughly upon localconditions. Otherwise British firms will find themselves driven out bythe Germans and Japanese, who are making vigorous and effectiveefforts to re-establish themselves in this field;(iv) there are in most of the other countries grave suspicions of the activities and intentions of the Argentine Government.Criticism centres in particular upon the unjustifiably numerousstaff at the Embassies, and especially upon the presence of a Labour
Adviser, whose mission is thought to be to create or stimulate industrial unrest and to preach the virtues of &quot; justicialismo&quot; to the local&quot; descamisados.&quot;They do not think that Peron has actual designs upon annexationof territory, but rather that he wishes to establish the Argentine as thePrussia of South America, to whom all the other countries must besuitably subservient, and to impose upon them the adoption of a systemof government similar to his own.They are apt to see the inadequately hidden hand of Argentineinterference everywhere and resent it most bitterly;(v) the representation of even the leading British papers throughout theContinent is of regrettably poor quality.The scanty news from Latin America published here and the some-what sensational twist often given to it are unfavourably commentedupon;(vi) the cutting down of British broadcasting services, however necessary, hashad an unfortunate effect on public opinion and their reinstatementwould be greatly welcomed.VIIIMr. Barclay&apos;s Notes on His Visits to Colombia and VenezuelaOn leaving Lima I flew via Guayaquil to Quito, where Her Majesty&apos;ambassador came to meet me, Cali, where I changed planes, and Bogota a somewhat exhausting day&apos;s journey, particularly in view of the sudden changes of climate and altitude involved. I was only able to spend one night in Bogota,.and apart from talks with Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador and the Secretary-Generalof the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, I only had time to make a rapid tour of thetown. There is plenty of evidence of development in progress, and perhaps one ofthe most impressive sights was the traffic at the airport, where passenger planes and large freighters were arriving and taking off at a rhythm which would not disgraceHeathrow or Northolt.From Bogota I flew to Maracaibo, where I met Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador toVenezuela, and we proceeded together to look over the Shell oilfields and instal-lations in the vicinity of the lake. The following day we flew on to Caracas. Agreat deal of new building and new road-making was in progress in almost all the places I visited, but nowhere perhaps on such a lavish scale as in Caracas. Aspectacular new highway up from the coast is nearly complete and valleys are beingfilled in and mountains terraced in order to provide more land for building. all this, of course, is being done on wealth derived from oil. Money is being spentlike water, and, as the Trade Mission will no doubt report, the opportunities forBritish exports of many kinds are very great. As it is, the Venezuelans have boughtfrom us Vampires and destroyers, they have placed orders for Comets andCanberras, and we should get a large order for escort vessels.I was in Caracas for the -two days prior to the elections, and when I calledupon the Minister for Foreign Affairs there was no doubt that he, like almosteveryone else, was confidently &quot;expecting the Government Party to secure asatisfactory majority. The elections did not, however, go according to plan, andthe present political situation is unstable. It is to be feared that any alternativeGovernment would represent a change for the worse from the point of view of the oil companies. The latter are quite alive to the dangers inherent in the presentsituation. The Extremists, both of the Left and of the Right, have unfortunatelyreceived some encouragement from the nationalisation of the tin companies inBolivia in spite of the economic difficulties and disorganisation to which this has given rise. .On my way through Washington I was able to have a useful exchange of views with Mr. Miller, the Assistant Under-Secretary in charge of Latin American Affairs,and some of his associates. Their appreciation of the situation in the variousSouth American countries did not differ greatly from our own. They are fullyalive to the dangers for foreign capital inherent in the present wave of nationalistfeeling in South America, and it may be that we shall find the new Administrationboth more ready to defend American overseas business interests and more under-standing of our own difficulties with Governments suffering from exaggeratednationalist tendencies.
