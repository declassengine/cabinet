THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1946.SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY.Joint Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty and theMinister of War Transport.WE circulate herewith a joint Memorandum dealing with the shipbuilding industry which was considered and agreed generally by the Lord presidents committee on the 1st February, 1946, subject to the following points.2. Certain members of the Lord Presidents Committee considered that, if.the proposed Committee is to include representatives of the shipowners, it shouldalso include representatives of the Unions of Officers and Seamen of theMerchant Navy, on the ground that they would be concerned in the design ofnew merchant ships and especially in such matters as accommodation and safety and defence measures. We are unable to agree with this proposed addition tothe membership of the Committee. The Committee will not deal in detail withdesign or the other points referred to, which are matters for considerationelsewhere. The Committee will be primarily concerned with the Industry&apos;scompetitive efficiency and the distribution and volume of its load of work. Forthis purpose representatives from the Industry&apos;s main customers, British ship-owners, are necessary. It is essential that the Committee should be kept as smallas practicable and capable of devoting itself exclusively to the urgent mattersrequiring its attention; we therefore feel that the presence of representativesof the Officers and Seamen of the Merchant Navy would weaken, rather thanstrengthen, the Committee.3. It was suggested at the Lord Presidents Committee that the phrase&quot; industrial relations &quot; in paragraph 4 of the proposed Terms of Reference wasobjectionable as indicating some tendency to remove such matters from existingnegotiating machinery. It is inevitable that matters will come up at the Com-mittee affecting industrial practice and demarcation questions; for instance,from the introduction of new production methods or machinery. It is theintention that when such questions arise, they shall be referred to the industry for consideration through the existing voluntary machinery. We therefore propose to amend (4) of the proposed terms of reference to read : &quot; (4) To advise from time to time on organisation, practice and cognatematters, with a view to maintaining and improving the efficiency and stability of the industry; and to arrange for such consultation withthe industry and for such enquiries into specific matters as may benecessary to this end &quot;;and to add a note to the terms of reference as follows : &apos;&apos; Any matters of industrial relations normally dealt with by voluntarymachinery within the Industry will be referred to the appropriate bodiesfor consideration.&quot;4.   The Minister of Labour and National Service asks that a representative     of his Department should be a permanent member of the Committee.  To this we agree and propose to modify the constitution of the Committee accordingly.[31317] bSECRET. Copy No.     JJgCP. (46) 64.15th February, 1946.CABINET.
5. As regards the method of nominating representatives of the Ship-building and Ship-repairing Industries and the Shipbuilding Trades Unions,the Lord Presidents Committee agreed, after discussion, that nominationsshould be made by us jointly, as proposed, but considered that it was desirablethat the Unions and other interests should be consulted beforehand; with thisview we are in agreement.6. &quot;We accordingly invite the Cabinet to approve our proposals as modified in paragraphs 3, 4 and 5 above.A. V. A.A. B.15th February, 1946.ANNEX.THE Shipbuilding Committee, set up under Cabinet authority inOctober 1944, was requested to prepare an estimate of the probable demand for ship building in the first ten years after the end of the war, indicating how far this demand was likely to provide full activity for the labour and capacity thenavailable in the Industry. The Committee reported in August last and we now circulate copies of their Report.*2.   The conclusions and recommendations of the Committee are as follows : (a) That at the end of the ten-year period, world tonnage should, for present purposes, be assumed to stand at not less than 70 million gross tons,and United Kingdom tonnage at its 1939 level of about 18 million gross tons.(6) That the total output for merchant ships from United Kingdom ship-yards during the same period will be 12^ million gross tons.(c) That during the ten-year period the demand for new merchant ships in United Kingdom shipyards may rise to a peak of over 1^ million gross tons about the fourth year and in the later years when thedemand is mainly for normal replacements, may fall to f million gross tons.(d) That, assuming a naval programme equivalent to an average of about500,000 gross tons of merchant ships a year and a ship industrysomewhat above its pre-war strength, the total labour force in theCommercial shipbuilding and ship-repair industry (ShipbuildingEmployers&apos; Federation) will fall from the &quot;present level of about160,000 to about 90,000.(e) That the dominant factor in the minds of shipowners and in the futureplanning of shipbuilding must be the methods to be adopted fordisposing of the large surplus war production of the United Statesand Canada.Recommendations.(i) That every effort should be made to restore the Mercantile Marine tothe pre-war figure of 18 million gross tons at the earliest momentcompatible with trade and other considerations likely to apply duringthe early years of the post-war period, and that efforts should be madeto obtain a larger share of world trade than at the outbreak of warin order to increase this figure,(ii) That every effort should be made to prevent the minimum level of employ -ment in the shipbuilding and repair industries from falling below90,000 peoplet in the years of low demand for new merchant ships.* Committee&apos;8 report not circulated to the Cabinet.f The 90,000 refers to men actually at work in the yards of the member firms of the shipbuilding Employers&apos; Federation. This corresponds to a level of about 120,000 persons inthe employment in the Shipbuilding and Ship-repairing Industry as a whole, excluding theEoyal Dockyards.
(iii) That, while meeting our obligations to British shipowners and Allieswho have suffered war losses, a reasonable proportion of our ship-building facilities should be made available to fulfil other overseaorders, particularly in those cases where there is a likelihood offurther orders following once the contract has been re-established.(iv) That, in the use and disposal of ex-enemy tonnage, any reactions uponthe United Kingdom shipbuilding industry should be carefully borne in mind. It is assumed that in general ex-enemy countries will not be permitted to build ocean-going ships,(v) That, in view of the possible effect of sales abroad on the building ofnew tonnage, the policy embodied in the war-time Ships and Aircraft(Transfer Restrictions) Act, 1939, should be examined in the light ofthe post-war shipbuilding and shipping position,(vi) That the reconversion of passenger and other vessels to their normaltrading purposes after the war be so arranged as to avoid throwing on building or repair yards a large volume of work concurrently with new building.(vii) That as far as practicable, in conformity with any overriding needs ofnational defence, the load of new naval work be adjusted so as to compensate fluctuations in the demand for merchant ships and thusstabilise employment in the industry, and that naval repairs shouldnot be entirely withdrawn from the commercial yards.(viii) That plans should be worked out at an early date for regulating thewithdrawals of war-built surplus tonnage so as to conform to fluctua-tions in the output of new tonnage and thereby contribute towards a stable output.3. Conclusion (e) stresses the importance of the future of the large surplusof ships produced during the war in the United States and Canada. The Ministerof War Transports paper (CP. (45) 299) explains the extent to which the UnitedStates is proposing to lay up tonnage and the arrangements negotiated, or under negotiation, for absorbing part of the United States, and a substantial part ofthe Canadian, surplus by taking tonnage under our flag on bareboat charter,pending replacement of the gaps in our own fleets by new building in this country.4. Turning to the Recommendations of the&apos; Committee, we find ourselves inagreement with them, subject to our comments on (viii) below : (i) The first recommendation is basic to those that follow. Our colleagues will agree that we cannot accept a smaller share of the world&apos;scarrying trade than we enjoyed before the war. On the contrary, everyeffort must be made to increase this share and thereby to increase theforeign exchange earned by this most important invisible export,(ii) and (vii) These recommendations are designed to stabilise the level ofemployment in the Shipbuilding and Repair Industries. For this tobe carried out successfully, it will be necessary for the naval building programme to be adjusted so as to make its heaviest demands on theindustry when the requirements for replacement or development ofmerchant fleets are at a low level. It is the intention of the Boardof Admiralty, in framing their new construction programmes, to take note of the needs of the Industry. Apart, however, from the overridingdemands of National Security, it may be difficult to square this policy with the existing system of annual estimates.The Admiralty realise also the advantage to the Industry of retaining a part of the Naval Repair programme, but they cannot atthis stage commit themselves to a policy which might permanentlyreduce the efficiency of the Royal Dockyards.(iii) The third recommendation has already been acted upon and a proportionof our shipbuilding facilities has been made available for export orders.Permits have been issued to overseas buyers for a total of over f million gross tons, of which&apos;orders for over \ million gross tons have alreadybeen placed. These arrangements have not limited the opportunities of British owners who wished to replace their war losses promptly,since the latter have been given priority of consideration.(iv) The Minister of War Transport has put before the Cabinet his proposals(CP. (45) 299) for the disposal of Government-owned tonnage,including any which might accrue to His Majesty&apos;s Government from[31317] b 2
ex-enemy fleets. We expect to obtain not less than 300,000 gross tonsof ex-German shipping. As regards shipbuilding in ex-enemy countries, the Cabinet has already decided that shipbuilding shouldnot be allowed in Germany until further notice,(v) The fifth recommendation relates to the continuance in peacetime of theEmergency Ships and Aircraft (Transfer Restriction) Act, 1939. TheMinister of War Transport is satisfied that it is necessary to retainthese powers for a transitional period and no decision is required inthis matter at present.(vi) This recommendation is a technical and administrative matter on which our two Departments are at present engaged.(vii) See (ii) above.(viii) The situation has changed as a result of the development of Americanpolicy as regards surplus tonnage (see paragraph 2 of CP. (45) 299)and this particular suggestion cannot be usefully pursued further atpresent.5. The main deduction we draw from the report is that while the problemof transition from war to peace has not yet thrown up as many difficulties as were feared, the uncertainties surrounding the future of the industry are such that some effort is required to be made now to endeavour to retain it in a highstate of efficiency both as an Export Industry and as part of our War Potential.6. Some of these difficulties, notably the vast amount of surplus tonnageafloat under the American flag are, of course, outside the power of anyone hereto solve, except in so far as counsel can be given to United States Authoritiesin our common interest, and such counsel has been given. But even if we assume that the total tonnage afloat will be reduced to a manageable amount there remainformidable problems, in the solution of which we think the Shipbuilding industry will need the help and co-operation of the Government.7. We do not consider that the Industry will need Control as it is exercisedto-day for very much longer, but we see great need for the continuance ofmachinery for close consultation and co-operation, by which we may hope to anticipate difficulties which threaten the Industry.8. To this end we propose the institution of a Shipbuilding AdvisoryCommittee as an intermediary between the Government and the Industry. Onsuch a Committee we propose that on the official side the two Departments mostconcerned with the Industry should be permanently represented, namely, theMinistry of War Transport and the Admiralty. Representatives of other Depart-ments could be co-opted from time to time as need arose, notably the Ministry ofLabour, the Treasury, the Ministry of Supply, the Board of Trade, Ministry of fuel and Power and D.S.I.R. The non-official members would be representativesof the Shipbuilding Industry, of their customers the Shipping Industry and of the shipbuilding Trade Unions.9. Two questions arise at once who should be the Chairman and to whomshould the Board be responsible ?10. On the whole we favour an independent Chairman who should have botha thorough understanding of Industry, though not necessarily of the shipbuilding industry and familiarity with the Machinery of Government. We should not favour anyone directly employed in the industry itself, and should prefer thatthe Chairman was not a Member of either of the two Departments primarily concerned.11. On the second question it is clear that both the Ministry of war transport and the Admiralty must have a considerable voice in any discussionof the recommendations of the Board, since both are profoundly affected by theefficiency of the Industry, but we find it difficult to conclude that either Depart-ment could reasonably be given full responsibility to the exclusion of the other.On the whole we consider that the new Advisory Committee should follow thepresent Shipbuilding Committee in being jointly appointed by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty and the Minister of War Transport. &quot;Responsibility &quot; does not really arise, since the Committee will not take decisions but tender advice to theGovernment through the two appointed Ministers.12. To sum up, we should propose the following official expression of thefunctions and terms of reference.
Terms of Reference.There shall be established a Shipbuilding Advisory Committee with thefollowing terms of reference : (1) To advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on all matters which affect or arelikely to affect the efficiency and stability of the Shipbuilding Industry;and in particular to advise on the part which the shipbuilding industry can play in fulfilling the policy of full employment.(2) To advise His Majesty&apos;s Government on any steps required to safeguard the war potential of the Industry.(3) To promote the co-operation of the Shipbuilding employers both withthe Shipowners and the representatives of Shipyard labour.(4) To advise from time to time on organisation, practice, industrial relations and cognate matters, with a view to maintaining and improving theefficiency and stability of the Industry; and to arrange for such consultation with the Industry and for such enquiries into specificmatters as may be necessary to this end.Composition.The Committee shall be constituted as follows: A Chairman.Two members of the Admiralty.Two members of the Ministry of War Transport.Representatives of the Shipping Industry.Representatives of the Shipbuilding Industry.Representatives of the Shipbuilding Trade Unions.The Committee shall have power to co-opt representatives of other Govern-ment Departments as may be necessary.The First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of War Transport wouldjointly nominate the Chairman and Members after such consultations as they may think fit, and would also jointly fix the number of representatives in the last three classes.A.
