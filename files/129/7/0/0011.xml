THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No. 3 8CP. (46) 61.12th February, 1946.CABINET.ORGANISATION OF GOVERNMENT SUPPLY.Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet.AT their meeting on the 2nd October, 1945 (CM. (45) 37th Conclusions), theCabinet approved in principle the recommendation for a single Ministry ofSupply and took note that the Prime Minister would tv appoint a Committee ofMinisters to consider the detailed organisation necessary to secure &apos;&apos; that this ministry &quot; would be so organised as to assure the Service Departments of continous and specific attention to their problems, that there would be a free-interchange of actively-minded officers between the fighting Services and theMinistry of Supply, and that research and development would be so organised asto give full scope to the interests &quot;and initiative of the user Departments.&quot;2. The questions at issue have now been discussed by the Ministers con-cerned, and the arrangements set out below have been approved, and are circulated for information at the Prime Ministers directions.E. E. B.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th February, 1946.ORGANISATION OF GOVERNMENT SUPPLY.IT has been agreed that the organisation necessary &quot; to ensure that theService Departments receive continuous and. specific attention to their problems,that there would be a free interchange of actively-minded officers between thefighting Services and the Ministry of Supply, and that research and development would be so organised as to give full scope to the interests and initiative of theuser Departments,&quot; should include the general arrangements set out below, detailsof which would, however, be worked out in further discussion between theDepartments concerned.2. Representation of user Departments on the Supply CounciL-TheMinister of Supply and of Aircraft Production proposes to set up a supply council under his own chairmanship in which the Admiralty, the War Office,the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Civil Aviation will be suitably represented.3. Appointments of Service personnel to the Ministry of Supply.&apos; -Particular importance attaches to the appointments which will be made to theimportant posts of Controller of Munitions Supplies, Controller of AircraftSupplies, Director-General of Scientific Research (Munitions) and Director-Genera,! of Scientific Research (Aeronautics). In regard to these and other posts,the principle to be observed should be that the best available man, whethercivilian or Service, should be appointed; in the case of the Controllers, if the top post is not filled by a serving officer the deputy post would be so filled.In practice it is believed that the two posts&apos;of Controller will normally be filled by serving officers and the two posts of Director-General of scientific research by civilians.[31304]
4. There will be a considerable integration of Service officers with civilians in appropriate posts throughout the Ministry, particularly in establishmentsdealing with research, design, development and inspection. The basis of appoint-ment would be the best man for the job, but this would be subject to an agreedcomplement of Service officers adequate in numbers to allow for the necessaryinterchange between the Ministry and Service appointments.5. Method of appointment. A system must be devised which, withoutimpairing the responsibility of the Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Produc-tion for making appointments to his Department, will secure that the interestsof the user Departments are satisfactorily represented by the serving officersemployed in the Ministry. In practice this will be achieved by inter-depart-mental consultation, and by arrangements based on experience. Thus, in the caseof officers of lower rank it will clearly be the responsibility of the user Depart-ment to put forward in the first instance the names of officers regarded as suitablefor service in the Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production, and to suggestarrangements for their replacement in due course.In cases in which the filling of an appointment concerns more than one userDepartment, the Ministry of Supply undertakes that there will be consultationwith all the user Departments concerned.Suitable machinery for consultation will, if necessary, be set up by agreementbetween the Departments concerned.6. Arrangements for liaison. The arrangements for close working relation-ships between the Ministry and the Service Departments and Ministry of CivilAviation will be maintained and will be developed still further. These arrange-ments will include (a) The present inter-service organisations for research, design and develop-ment (Ordnance Board, Armaments Research, Armaments Design,Chemical Defence, Radio, &amp;c), developed as may be foundappropriate.(b) The various Boards and Committees with joint Service and Supply repre-sentation.(c) Machinery for consultation between Service and Supply Departments,both on basic research and development priorities of weapons putforward by the user Departments and also on the progressing ofarticles in production.(d) Arrangements satisfactory to the Service Departments for the acceptance,inspection and proof of Service stores to ensure that the requirementsof the user Departments are met, subject to one question which isunder discussion between the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Supplyand of Aircraft Production.7.   Finance^ (a) Provision for stores should be made on the Votes of the user Departments.1 (&amp;) Research and development should be a final charge on the Vote for theMinistry of Supply.   (The Admiralty would continue to carry on itsown Vote the research and development for which it is responsible.)(c) Production, research and development programmes would be settled afterthe fullest consultation between the Ministry, the Service Depart-ments and the Ministry of Civil Aviation.8. Arrangements for settlement of differences. If differences arise betweenthe user Departments and the Ministry of Supply which cannot be settled betweenthe Ministers concerned, these will be referred to the Defence Committee, theMinisters of Supply and Civil Aviation being present as necessary.This procedure would be followed if, for example, disputes arose betweenthe user Departments as to the apportionment of the resources available for research and development programmes.* This is a problem which will not arise until 1947 since it is agreed that the war-timesystem whereby no repayments are made from the user Departments to the Ministry willcontinue during the year 1946.
