(46) 57.11th February, 1946.CABINET.REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON VICTORY CELEBRATIONS.IN accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on the 1st November, 1945(CM. (45) 48th Conclusions, Minute 4), the Prime Minister appointed aCommittee under my Chairmanship to formulate plans for official VictoryCelebrations and to supervise the detailed arrangements to be worked out by oneor more Committees of officials. On behalf of the Committee I now submit our recommendations.2. To minimise interference with industrial production the Cabinetsuggested that the celebrations might be held on a Sunday.3. It seemed to the Committee that religious opinion might be offended ifVictory Celebrations took place on a Sunday and that a Sunday parade would notbe popular with those taking part, in that it would involve the loss of a free day.Furthermore, a Victory Celebration without a public holiday would lose some ofits appeal to the general public. We considered the alternatives of WhitSaturday, the 8th June, and the 3rd August and felt that the latter date was too late for the celebrations. We therefore selected the 8th June which, as it immediately precedes a statutory holiday, would involve less interference with industrial production than any other week day in the early summer and wouldenable the greatest number of people to enjoy the celebrations. Furthermore,although any date would be arbitrary, the 8th June is close to the 6th June,D-day, the day which probably was the most dramatic day of the war to thepeople of the British Commonwealth.4. We appointed an Official Committee to submit detailed proposals for a victory March, children&apos;s entertainments and lighting displays in London onthe 8th June.5. We have carefully considered the recommendations of the Official Com-mittee circulated in the accompanying report and submit them for general approval.  The proposals for official celebrations are that : (1) there should be a Victory Parade in London in the morning, consistingof one column marching through the West End, the other- amechanised column passing through East and South-East London,joining in Parliament Square and marching past The King in the mall;(2) in this parade the belligerent Allies should be represented by smallrepresentative detachments; the bulk of the parade should consist ofthe Armed Forces and of representatives of civilian services andindustry;(3) each of the two columns should be headed by representative BritishCommanders;(4) in view of shortages of labour and material no special steps should bemade to erect stands or to provide special reserved accommodation toany large extent;(5) children&apos;s entertainments should be organised in the four Royal Parks(and in the King&apos;s Park, Edinburgh) on the afternoon of the8th June, while other entertainments should be arranged for childrenduring the afternoons of the following week;Memorandum by the Home Secretary.[31258a]
(6) a souvenir card should be officially provided for the children;(7) in the evening, certain public buildings should be floodlit and a search-light display and an aquatic and fireworks display on the Thamesarranged;(8) an official programme should be produced by His Majesty&apos;s stationery office.6. In addition, the Official Committee suggest the guidance to be given tolocal authorities and to licensing authorities with regard to local Victory parades,public entertainments, extensions of permitted hours, and gifts for old people;they point out the necessity of taking steps to secure as far as possible thatshops dealing with food-stuffs, and other immediate necessities of the public, open for a period during Victory Celebrations Hay to enable the essential needs of thepublic to be met.7. To enable the necessary arrangements to be made, the decision of theCabinet oh the date and the general form and nature of the celebrations is urgently required.J. C.

(46) 1stMeeting), it was agreed that an Official Committee should be set up, representativeof the Departments concerned, to consider detailed plans for Victory celebrationsin the light of the discussions at the Committee and to report their recommenda-tions within 28 days.The Official Committee consists of representatives of the Admiralty, Ail-Ministry, Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Colonial Office, Dominions Office,Ministry of Education, Foreign Office, Ministry of Health, Home Office, IndiaOffice, Ministry of Labour and National Service, Scottish Office, Treasury,Ministry of War Transport, War Office, Ministry of Works, and MetropolitanPolice. In the course of their consideration of the matters referred to them theywere assisted by representatives of the Board of Trade, Ministry of Food, Ministryof Fuel and Power, London County Council, City of London Police and london passenger Transport Board.The Ministerial Committee agreed that the celebrations should be termed&quot; Victory Celebrations,&quot; should consist in London of a Victory March, children&apos;sentertainments and a lighting display, and should be held, if possible on the same day, the 8th June, which should be declared a public holiday.We submit, below, for the consideration of Ministers, detailed proposals asto the form and nature of the Parade, the children&apos;s entertainments and theilluminations.The elaboration of these proposals, if they are approved, will involve a lot of work : for example, camps will have to be prepared for the Service contingents,arrangements made to bring Dominion, Indian and Colonial representatives tothis country, and contracts placed without delay for the various entertainments.If the Victory Celebrations are to take place on the date fixed by Ministers, it isdesirable that very early decisions should be taken by Ministers on the proposed arrangements.Signed on behalf of the Official Committee :H. A. STRUTT, Chairman.Cabinet Office, Qth February, 1946.[31258]b
THE REPORT.I.-THE VICTORY PARADE.A. Route.1. In accordance with the directions we received from the Ministerial Com-mittee we have examined the practicability of two processions in London, onethrough the West End, the other through the East End, and we recommendthat (i) a marching column should be routed through the West End, and(ii) a motorised column (M.T. Column) through the East End.2. The columns would have different starting points and the greater part oftheir routes would be separate; but they must converge before, and follow oneroute past, the saluting base. In determining the distances the columns shouldtraverse, we have been guided by the following factors, viz., the inclusion of theWomen&apos;s Services .and civilian contingents in the Marching Column and, in thecase of the M.T. Column, the slow running of engines over a long distance andthe physical fatigue of drivers of heavy vehicles over a long period. We have,therefore, come to the conclusion that the distances from starting point todispersal point should not exceed miles for the Marching Column and 15 milesfor the M.T. Column.3. As to the routes, we felt that the procession should pass along Whitehall,which is traditionally used on such ceremonial occasions; that shopping centres,such as Oxford Street, should be included as far as possible; that the heavily bombed area of East and South-East London should be visited, and that inter-ference with holiday traffic at the main London railway termini, such as VictoriaStation, should be reduced to a minimum.4. Our main difficulty was to reconcile the inclusion of both Whitehall andthe shopping area with a fairly short marching route. This problem can be resolved, however, by routeing the columns through Trafalgar Square on both theinward and outward journeys and by very careful traffic control.Our recommendation is that the marching route should be Marble Arch (starting point)-0,xford Street-Charing Cross Road-Trafalgar Square-Northumberland Avenue-Embankment-Bridge Street-Whitehall-the Mall-Constitution Hill-Hyde Park Corner [dispersal point).(Map No. 1.)5. The route for the M.T. Column raised peculiar difficulties, includingvarious safety factors, e.g., bridge loads and overhead clearances, the suitability of the route for change of direction by heavy track vehicles, the provision of asuitable point for joining the Marching Column and of adequate recoveryarrangements to ensure that breakdowns do not block the route. We have considered several alternatives and after a survey we recommend that the route for the M.T. column should be Regents Park-Park Square West (starting point)-Marylebone Road-Euston Road-Pentonville Road-City Road-Old Street-Hackney Road-Cambridge Heath Road-Whitechapel Road-Whitechapel High Street-Aldgate High Street-Mansell Street-Royal Mint Street-Tower Hill-Eastcheap-London Bridge-Borough High Street-Newington Causeivay-Newington Butts-Kenning ton Park Road-Harleyford Street-KenningtonOval-Harleyford Road-V auaihall Bridge-MiUbank-Parliament Sqiiare-Parliament Street-Whitehall-Admiralty Arch-the Mall-Constitution Hill-Hyde Park Corner-Park Lane-Edgivare Road-Marylebone Road-RegentsPark.   (Map No. 2.)6. The Marching and M.T. Columns would join in Parliament Square,where the head of the M.T. Column would be halted and timed into Whitehall.
B. The Composition and Size of the Parade.A Hied Representation.7. When the Ministerial Committee discussed the question, attention was drawn to the great problems of feeding and accommodation which would arise ifthe fighting services of the Allies were included. The detailed examination whichwe have given to the point has led us to recommend that (a) Allied Heads of Diplomatic Missions should be invited to the SalutingBase, and(b) contingents of each of the belligerent Allies (other than Italy) andpossibly of Egypt and Iraq, should head the marching column. each party should consist of not less than (i) three high ranking officers,(ii) three A .D.Cs. or Staff Officers, and(iii) a representative party of three men for each fighting service,- subject, however, to larger representation of each of the four majorAllies, and  to the  inclusion in the general body of the R.A.F.contingent of foreign detachments which had served within the framework of the R.A.F.8. The principal object of the parade is to honour the contribution to finalvictory of the peoples of the British Commonwealth. To this end every phase ofour Imperial war effort should be represented in the columns.We therefore submit for the consideration of Ministers the following outlineorder of march and provisional block allotments : Marching Column Contingent.Allies ...Dominions (including Southern Rhodesia,Newfoundland and High CommissionerTerritories)...India and BurmaColoniesRoyal Navy (including  Merchant   navy and Fishing Fleet)*Civilian Services   (including IndustrialContingent) (1st Block) ...Army (including Home Guard)*Civilian   Services   (including   IndustrialContingent) (2nd Block)...R.A.F. (including Royal Observer Corpsand selected representatives of Alliedairmen serving with the R.A.F.)ProvisionalAllotment.1,2501,000-2,0001,1501,3001,000-1,5003,000-5,0001,000-1,500Notes.As indicated in para-graph 7(b) above.To include representa-tives of all services.1,600* It is proposed that the majority of these detachments Bhould be drawn from the london area; but small representative contingents would be brought from other parts of the country.A provisional list of the interests which would be included is given in the Appendix.M.T. Column Contingent.Royal Navy  ...Army ...R.A.F. ...      .......Civilian ServicesNumber ofV chicles.162206452Notes.Order of march to bedetermined later.9. The March will take approximately two hours and it will be necessary fordetachments to be on parade for an hour and a half before it starts. In view ofthe strain which the March will involve we have not included in the detachmentsfrom the Armed Forces representatives of the cadet organisations of the three services. If, however, Ministers should decide that the contingents of theFighting Forces should include persons other than men and women who servedduring the war, it would be possible to make special selections of small numbersof older cadets to take part in the parade. Alternatively, selected cadets fromall three Services could line a portion of the route, preferably near buckingham palace.C. The March Past and the Saluting Base.10.   If the marching column moves 12 abreast and vehicles in the M.T.column in pairs an arrangement which will make possible the inclusion of the[31258] b 2
largest practicable number of units and add to the spectacular value of theprocession the March Past from the head of the marching column to the tailof the M.T. column would, allowing for a short interval of not more than15 minutes between the two columns, take just over \\ hours; the marching columntaking approximately 55 minutes and the M.T. column 30 minutes. During the interval between the two columns massed pipe bands would march and counter-march in the Mall. We have it in mind that the head of the marching columnshould pass the Saluting Base at 11-30 a.m., and that the tail of the M.T. columnshould be clear by 1 -10 p.m.  The R.A.F. would fly past.11.   We considered three alternatives for the Saluting Base : (i) The centre gate of Buckingham Palace;(ii) The Victoria Memorial;(iii) The Mall near Marlborough Gate.The Saluting Base for the 1919 March was the Victoria Memorial, which provided an ideal spectacular background. If the Palace Gate were chosen, the VictoriaMemorial could be used for privileged spectators. But should our recommenda-tions as to the constitution and form of the Parade be generally approved, certainvery serious objections to either the Palace or the Victoria Memorial arise. Itis essential for a marching column 12 abreast and for tracked vehicles to havea straight run up to the Saluting Base. It is most desirable to maintain the momentum of the march past the Saluting Base; and any sharp turn or curveat, or near to, the Saluting Base would be disastrous to the ceremonial at its mostimportant point.12. We have, therefore, considered the alternative of a site in the Mall,and have come to the conclusion that the length of straight, wide thoroughfareon either side of the Marlborough Gate, outweighs the disadvantages of theloss of architectural background, the diminished value of the Victoria Memorialas a stand for spectators, and the trees somewhat blocking the view. The space in front of the park gates on the South side of the Mall lends itself for aSaluting Base : there is ample space opposite for bands and the Salute would,as in 1919, be &quot; eyes left.&quot;A ccordingly we recommend that the Saluting Base should be in the Mall :and if The King should be graciously pleased to approve this proposal we would further express the hope that His Majesty would be pleased to drive in state to and from the Saluting Base the approach to be lined with troops.D. British Commanders.13. We have discussed what roles might be taken in the parade by the victorious Commanders. In 1919 they took part at the head of their arm ofthe Services. But the 1919 parade consisted of one column only, whereas onthis occasion two columns with widely differing routes are proposed. Thealternative possibilities are for the Commanders : -(i) to lead the marching contingents on horseback, or on foot;(ii) to ride in suitable vehicles with the M.T. column;(iii) to precede the marching column contingents in suitable vehicles; or(iv) for some of the Commanders to lead each of the columns.14. The first alternative, which identifies the Commanders with their ownServices, is the traditional form, especially if the Commanders are mounted andso better visible to the public; unfortunately, suitable horses are likely to bescarce; the second wouid allow the East End to see the Commanders; the thirdcreates the difficulty of combining M.T. with a marching column and tends todivorce the Commanders from the marching troops; the fourth may create diffi-culties as to the selection of Commanders for each column, but it would increasethe appeal of the mechanised column and. is that which vie suggest for adoption.E. Accommodation.Enclosures.15.   In 1919 stands were erected to accommodate the following : House of Lords............       ...       ...      1,044House of CommonsChildren (Service Orphanage, Schools, &amp;c.)WoundedL.V. Association1,6083,0452,7301,236
Of the 2,652 seats allocated to the Lords and Commons, only 1,242 were taken up. The-balance was redistributed to government departments, distinguishedvisitors, &amp;c. Enclosures were also provided for 12,184 widows and 5,436discharged soldiers. The total accommodation thus provided amounted to27,283 places. On this occasion, however, it will not be possible to providematerials for stands. Moreover, the disappearance of the park railings and the limited number of Police available to look after two processions, would make itimpossible for the Police to guarantee reserved standing accommodation to any considerable extent. There would be space for standing accommodation asfollows : Hyde Park Corner IslandsNorth Side of Constitution HillQueen Victoria Memorial Gardens   ...Queen Victoria MemorialOn either side of the saluting point (for distinguishedpersonages)26,500But we suggest for the consideration of Ministers that no attempt shoidd bemade to guarantee standing accommodation for anything like these numbers. Itmay well be that reserved standing accommodation could only be guaranteed fora few thousand people.Two hundred yiersons, in addition to The King and his suite, could be accom-accommodated on a stand at the Saluting Point. Up to 1,000 additional persons mightbe provided with chairs on the ground on each side.Assembly Areas.16. It is proposed that the War Office should be responsible for the accommodation and administration of the contingents of the Armed Forces, andthat for this purpose accommodation should be reserved for camps in KensingtonGardens and Regent&apos;s Park, and for assembly and forming up areas in hyde park and Regent&apos;s Park.17. The accommodation, assembly and marshalling of the civilian services would be the responsibility of the Departments listed in the Appendix hereto.II.-CHILDREN&apos;S ENTERTAINMENTS.A. Entertainments in Royal Parks.18. The space available in the Royal Parks for staging entertainments for children will be limited, on account of the requirements for camps and assemblyareas for those taking part in the processions (see paragraph 16). We were alsoadvised that the London Transport services, both road and rail, which will bc-carrying the ordinary Whitsun holiday traffic as well as the crowds assemblingfor the victory celebrations, will be so heavily loaded as to make it difficult to copesafely with the addition of any substantial number of school children. Theabsence of stands and barriers such as were provided at the times of the Jubileeand the Coronation, would make large scale assemblies hazardous. The schools will be closed on Whit Saturday and Whit Monday, and for this reason it mightbe difficult to ensure the attendance of teachers to organise and conduct parties ofchildren to the Parks.19. It seemed to us, therefore, that it would be umvise, and might well be impracticable, to provide large-scale entertainments for organised parties ofchildren in the Royal Parks on the afternoon of Saturday, the 8th June. On theother hand we recognise that many parents will wish to bring their children tosee the Victory March or the lighting display, or both, and it would seem desir-able that some entertainment in the Royal Parks should be provided in the after-noon, to which parents may take their children. We therefore suggest that achildren&apos;s entertainment, which might consist of an open-air play, a children&apos;sconcert, a display of country dancing and community singing, should be arranged in regent&apos;s  Park, Hyde Park, Green Park and St. Jamefs Park. Music mightbe provided by military bands at these entertainments which would be open to all3.5009,0008,5004,5001,000
children and parents who choose to attend. Tickets would not be required; parkchairs could be made available at a small charge; marquees for light refreshmentsat popular prices could be provided. We also recommend that generally similarentertainments should be provided in the King&apos;s Park, Edinburgh.B. Dispersed Entertainments during Whitsun Week.20. If it were decided that less centralised entertainments during Whitsunweek should be arranged, we suggest that the following entertainments might beprovided for organised parties of school children from the Greater London area.(i) A circus, fair and rodeo at Wembley Stadium. There is ample spacehere, access is convenient and there will be no insuperable difficulty inconveying organised parties of children to and from Wembley,provided that the times of travel, and particularly of departure, werestaggered so as to avoid the need for transporting children during the peak travel periods. About 30,000 children could safely be accomodated daily,(ii) A childrens play at the Open Air Theatre, Regent&apos;s Park, which wouldaccommodate 1,000 daily.(iii) Plays for children at Sadler&apos;s Wells, the Children&apos;s Theatre at ToynbeeHall, the People&apos;s Palace, the Granville Theatre at Walham Greenand at a theatre arranged with the Old Vic Company. The use ofthese theatres would lighten the load on the transport services of central London and accommodate in the aggregate some 4,250 childrendaily.(iv) Free visits to the Zoo, which could take 20,000 children daily, in additionto the normal attendance.Altogether, these entertainments would cater for some 60,000 children daily.21. Should these suggestions be adopted an early decision is necessary topermit of the immediate booking of accommodation, artists and performers.Admission would be by tickets to be distributed to the schools through the agency of the local education authorities. In view of their considerable experience inmatters of this kind the London County Council might be invited to co-coordinate the marshalling of the organised parties of children, and to assist, in consultationwith other local authorities, in the allocation of tickets to the Greater Londonareas lying outside the County Council area. It would be for the local educationauthorities to arrange escorts for the children, but it is thought that for an occasion of this kind many teachers would be willing to volunteer their services, as also would women&apos;&apos;s organisations, such as the W.V.S. Travel should be free.As the children may be away from their homes for several hours some arrangement should be made to enable them to purchase light refreshments, such as soft drinks,tea and buns; we understand that this could be arranged without difficulty.22. In considering the provision by the Government of organised entertain-ments on this scale for the Greater London area, Ministers will doubtless take account of the fact that in other areas the cost will fall upon the rates.C. Souvenirs.23. We understand that local authorities are already making enquiries, inconnection with local celebrations contemplated when the official Victory Celebra-tions are announced, whether it is possible for arrangements to be made toenable them to purchase suitable souvenirs for presentation to the children. It istraditional to give such souvenirs, but the manufacturing position is such that theproduction of, for instance, a suitably designed and coloured mug which localauthorities could purchase for presentation is probably out of the question. Wetherefore suggest that a commemorative card of appropriate design, similar tothat sent by Her Majesty The Queen to householders who had cared for evacuees,bearing a message from The King, should be prepared and distributed officiallyby the Government through the local education authorities. We think that thepublic would regard such a card as a graceful gesture to mark the occasion. Itwould be an advantage if the card were of a type suitable for hanging withoutframing, and if the back of the card were to record the outstanding dates of thewar; it might also have a space headed &quot; My Family&apos;s War Service &quot; to serve fora family record.
III.-ILLUMINATIONS AND DECORATIONS.24. In 1919 the Peace Celebrations terminated with a firework display inHyde Park and with the lighting of Admiralty deck flares in various parts ofLondon. During the past 25 years alternative forms of lighting displayhave been developed and we have, therefore, considered the use of floodlighting,a searchlight display, a firework display and an aquatic display on the Thames!A. Floodlighting.25. The celebrations on VE- and VJ-Days included floodlighting. Its usewas not limited to official buildings in the Capital; no objection was raised tofloodlighting by local authorities and public bodies. The period of floodlightingwas limited, and electric advertisements, neon signs and shop-window lighting-were not allowed, in view of the need for fuel economy. We are advised thatthe Minister of Fuel and Power would not wish to oppose floodlighting for ashort period. Accordingly, we suggest that the buildings floodlit by the Ministryof Works on VE-Day and VJ-Day, with a few additions, e.g., Windsor Castle(with His Majesty&apos;s approval), the Banqueting Hall, the towers of the War office in Whitehall and Edinburgh Castle, should be -floodlit between the hows of10 p.m. and midnight from the 8th June to the 15th June inclusive, and that forthe same period local authorities, public bodies and large firms should be permitted to floodlight their buildings should they so desire. Other decorativelighting and lighted advertisements should not be allowed.26. We understand that the lack of trained personnel and transport difficulties make it altogether unlikely that lighting material in the form ofportable lights, &amp;c., which the Armed Forces had in store, could be used forilluminations.B. Searchlight Display.27. A.A. Command can supply, and subject to reinforcement, can man72 searchlights for co-operation with aircraft in the London area, producing alayout of approximately 14 square miles centred on Westminster. A further18 searchlights, the beams of which might be coloured, can be provided for theillumination of static objects in London, but cannot be used for co-operation with aircraft owing to the shortage of trained operators. A few searchlights might also be provided for illuminating static objects in the provinces, if localauthorities so desire. If the limited number of searchlights is to give an effective display, aircraft should be used as a target on which to concentrate thebeams, if cones are to be formed. We are advised that up to four aircraft at atime would be available to fly singly over London; in view of safety precautionswhich, for instance, would prohibit them from flying below 4,000 feet, theaircraft will not themselves be an effective spectacle.We recommend that a searchlight display be arranged.C. Flares.28. We examined the possibility of using flares, recognition signals, &amp;c, aspart of the illuminations. We are, however, advised that the use of flares wouldinvolve considerable dangers to persons and property, as the percentage of dudswhich do not light but which fall and burst, possibly causing fires, is as high as 15 per cent. Moreover, the Admiralty report a shortage of deck flares whichcould be used on the ground. Regretfully we are therefore unable to recommend the use of any of these devices.D. -Aquatic Display and Fireworks.29. One of the most effective sights during the celebrations in Paris on theoccasion of The King&apos;s visit in 1938 was a display on the Seine. We think that-such a display should be organised on the Thames. We therefore propose,between the hours of 10 p.m. and midnight on Saturday, the 8th June, a displayin the reach of the Thames between, Westminster and Lambeth Bridges. TheNational Fire Service can provide and man six fireboats, and the Ministry ofWorks can probably devise and make mechanism to give spiral effects to the jets,which would be illuminated by means of coloured projectors and possibly by
small craft supplied by the Admiralty, as well as by mobile generators andsearchlights mounted in barges and lighting from the &quot;banks. Illuminated jetsfrom fire pumps could be discharged from the temporary bridges north of westminster Bridge and south of Lambeth Bridge. The firework display,including rockets and set pieces, might be arranged on the temporary bridges.The facade of the Houses of Parliament and the Clock Tower would in any case be floodlit, and no doubt County Hall and Westminster and Lambeth Bridgeswould be similarly lighted.30. Westminster and Lambeth Bridges would be closed to vehicular traffic;the crowds could assemble on these bridges, in the Victoria Tower gardens andon the Albert Embankment. The only part of the perimeter not open to thepublic would be the portion occupied by the Houses of Parliament.31.   In addition the Admiralty could berth : (a) Two light cruisers at Greenwich.(b) Pour destroyers in Woolwich Reach.(c) Two sloops and a number of minesweepers in the lower pool belowTower Bridge.It is suggested that these vessels, together with H.M.S. Chrysanthemum and h.M.S. President, might be ilhiminated or floodlit at night and that the public might be permitted to visit them on Whit Sunday and Whit Monday.E. Decorations .32. The Ministry of Works can decorate the public buildings in Whitehalland Trafalgar Square and, subject to the availability of the necessary poles, the mall, Constitution Hill and the Queen Victoria Memorial Gardens. They could also decorate St. Andrew&apos;s House in Edinburgh and the Welsh Board of Healthbuilding at Cardiff, but not buildings in their charge elsewhere.- F.-Transport Facilities.33. We have considered the problem of getting Londoners home after mid-night on Saturday, the 8th June, and to a lesser extent on the following nightswhen, if our recommendations were approved, floodlighting would be in opera-tion. We understand that the last trains on the Underground railway will runabout 12 - 30 a.m. and that, by the 8th June, the times of the last trams and busesfrom inner terminals will have been changed from 10-30 p.m. to 11-30 p.m. (Thelarger part of the south-east area of London is served almost entirely by tramsand buses.) On the basis that the Summer Time Acts will be in operation it willnot be dark until shortly after 10 o&apos;clock and consequently there will be very littlepoint in the lighting display taking place until 10-15 p.m. But to extend the times of the last trams and buses for one night, or one week after the Victory celebra-tions, would, even if the Union agreed, entail an excessive burden on thescheduling staff already loaded with other commitments for general improve-ments, and the Ministry of War Transport do not regard it as feasible. Weunderstand, however, that the Ministry of War Transport will ask the main-linerailway companies to consider, in consultation with the Unions, the running ofadditional late trains.34. It is mainly because of the transport difficulty that we have come to theconclusion that we shotdd not attempt to arrange a national display at more thanone point. To do so would only result in dividing the interest of the population and seriously curtailing the effectiveness of the scheme. No doubt local authorities will wish to arrange small displays in their own areas.IV.-COST OF OFFICIAL VICTORY CELEBRATIONS.35. Pending Ministerial approval of our proposals we have not attempted to prepare a general estimate of the cost of the Celebrations. Certainexpenditure would be incurred bv the War Office in constructing temporary accommodation; the Ministry of Works would be responsible for decorations, fire-works, floodlighting and, possibly, other entertainments; and a large number of departments would be involved in the expense of the transport and maintenanceof personnel taking part in the parades.
9 .     27V.-PUBLIC HOLIDAY.36. Some weeks before V.E.-Day the Government announced that its policy as an employer would be to pay wages for the days of holiday; a similarannouncement was made before V.J.-Day. By so doing, the Government gave a lead to industry, and, by means of the usual negotiating machinery, employers&apos;associations and trade unions reached agreements as to the payment to be madeto workpeople who could take the holiday and to those who would be requiredto work.37. Some firms not covered by agreements were reluctant to pay for the holidays, especially the &quot; V.E. + 2&quot; Day. Numerous complaints were received through members of Parliament, particularly from firms not on Government work.In some cases disputes were reported under the Conditions of Employment and national Arbitration Order, 1940. and three cases that could not be settled other-wise had to be referred to the National Arbitration Tribunal for a decision thatis binding and forms an implied term of contract between the employers andworkpeople.38. The Ministry of Labour and National Service take the view that withthe passage of time, the decrease in Government contract work, the gradualremoval of the Essential Work Orders and the change-over of labour sinceV.E.-Day and V.J.-Day, employers will be more reluctant to pay for a furtherholiday. Some agreements provide payment for all proclaimed holidays, but in others a limited number of public holidays are paid for (e.g., six per annum).In several industries it is still the case that no payment is made for any suchdays, e.g., engineering, where the only paid holidays are six days annual holidaysunder a credits scheme and where payment for V.E.-Day and V.J.-Day restedupon a recommendation by the employers&apos; federation to their members and notupon an agreement with the unions.39. The Ministry of Labour and National Service suggest that thesediffi-culties might be lessened by an emphasis in the announcement that this wouldbe the final Victory holiday and by the choice of a Saturday (for which paymentof wages would in the vast majority of cases be only half-a-day).VI.-OFFICIAL PROGRAMME.40. In 1919 His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office produced an official programmeof the Peace Celebrations which was sold for one pennyr. No doubt ministers would desire that, particularly in view of the shortage of space in the newspapers,an official programme should be produced on this occasion by His Majesty&apos;stationery Office. If such a publication is desired, it will be necessary for HisMajesty&apos;s Stationery Office to be notified as quickly as possible, so that thenecessary steps to secure paper and make arrangements for printing may be taken without delay. It is suggested that, subject to acknowledgment of copyright, noexception need be taken to the inclusion of information from an official programme in any more elaborate souvenir which may be contemplated by, e.g., charitableorganisations.VII.-MISCELLANEOUS.A. Celebrations Outside London.41. Apart from the decoration and floodlighting of certain government buildings in Edinburgh and Cardiff, and the provision of children&apos;s entertain-ments in the King&apos;s Park in Edinburgh, we have made no suggestion for theorganisation of celebrations by the Government outside London. This can, wethink, best be left to local authorities; but some guidance will have to be givento them, and authority for the expenditure involved will be required from theMinistry of Health and from the Scottish Office. In this connection thefollowing points arise : (a) Local Victory Processions.There seems no reason to discourage Local Authorities from organisingprocessions, if they so desire, with such help as the Services can give them.They would have to be Avarned, hoAvever, that with demobilisation proceed-ing apace the contingents which they may be able to arrange from the armed forces with local commanders will be very small.[31258] c
(b) Children&apos;s Entertainments.These should, it is suggested, be encouraged, and Local Authoritiesinformed of any arrangements proposed to be made in London.(c) Local Lighting Displays.We have suggested in paragraph 25 that there is no objection to flood-lighting for a limited period, but that other forms of lighting now prohibitedshould not be used.(d) Ringing of Bells.The day will no doubt be celebrated throughout the country by theringing of bells. This should, we think, be left to local discretion withoutany lead from the Government.(e) Bonfires.On these occasions it is traditional for bonfires to be lit. It is suggestedthat no exception need be taken to this form of entertainment in appropriateplaces.B. Public Entertainment.42. On the assumption that Ministers would wish that as many alternative forms of public entertainment are available as possible, and in order to ease thetransport position, theatres, music halls and cinemas should remain open, andwe would suggest that, as was done in connection with VE-Day, premises licensedfor music and dancing by the pxiblic might remain open later on the night of the8th June, and that the Home Office and Scottish Office should encourage authori-ties which license such places to take no exception to the prolongation of theentertainment to the latest hour permitted by the &quot; late night&quot; under the licenceor the relative bye-laws.43.   Local Authorities should be encotiraged to organise open-air entertainments in the local park or open space. /C. Licensed Premises : Extensions of Permitted Hours.44. On occasions of national rejoicing it has been the practice for licensed premises to be granted extensions of hours. We recommend that, as happenedon VE-Day, the afternoon break should be maintained and that licensing authori-ties and the Trade should be told that the Government think that licensing authorities should, in respect of the 8th June only, consider sympathetically, inthe light of local opinion, applications for special orders for the extension ofpermitted hours.D. Shops.45. The declaration of a public holiday on a Saturday might cause seriousinconvenience to the general public. We suggest that, as was done in connectionwith the public holidays on VE-day and VJ-day, the Home Office and the scottish office should suggest to the appropriate trade associations the desirability of shops dealing in food-stuffs and other immediate requirements of the publicopening for a sufficient period diiring the day to enable the essential needs ofthe public to be met.E. Gifts for Old People, &amp;c.46. Where a Local Authority wishes to make reasonable provision for giftsto old people, entertainments in institutions, &amp;c, it is suggested that approvalof the necessary expenditure need not be withheld.
