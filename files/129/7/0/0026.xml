O - O /iu.,_,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.104SECRET. , Copy No.    3 8CP. (48) 76.22nd February, 1946.CABINET.EMPLOYMENT OF ROMAN CATHOLICS BY THE british council IN SPAIN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE British. Council operates in Spain under an agreement concludedbetween His Majesty&apos;s Government and the Spanish Government in February1940, whereby all teachers and British personnel employed in British Institutesin Spain are required to be Roman Catholics. This condition was accepted &quot;byHis Majesty&apos;s Government at the time owing to the importance of maintaining and developing an instrument for counteracting Axis propaganda in Spain.2. No other foreign Government has sought to impose a similar restriction on the British Council; and it is clearly undesirable in principle for His Majesty&apos;sGovernment to submit to this stipulation, which is contrary to Article I of theUnited Nations Charter. Moreover, the agreement has not been strictly adhered to by the British Council. Of their staff in Spain eight out of twenty-eightLondon-appointed officers are non-Catholics. No objection has been raised by theSpanish Government to these appointments. But even so the situation is unsatis-factory, as we lay ourselves open to a breach of faith.3. It must be recognised, however, that if we inform the Spanish Govern-ment that we cannot adhere to the agreement, we run a certain risk that theBritish Council may have to close down in Spain. Not only is the SpanishMinister for Foreign Affairs an ardent Roman Catholic, but since all teachers in spain are required to be Catholic, special legislation might be necessary to permit of the appointment of non-Catholic teachers to the British Institutes.General Franco himself is, moreover, in an uncompromising mood, and if, as islikely, he would not be sorry to get rid of the Council, a threat on cur part towithdraw it would merely play into his hands.4. The British Council has done excellent work in Spain in spreading aknowledge of the English language and an appreciation of British culture. HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador would regret the cessation of its activities, and has advised that the agreement should be allowed to stand until the present regime comes to an end, in the hope that a new Government would accept its abrogation. It is,however, not certain that such a Government would be more amenable than thepresent one; and in the circumstances I would suggest that we should instructHis Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to inform the Spanish Government that we no longerfeel able to operate under the conditions laid down in 1940 and must, therefore,withdraw from the agreement. We hope, however, that our action will not involve any interference with the work of the British Council in Spain.E. B.Foreign Office,22nd February, 1946.13166   [31355]
