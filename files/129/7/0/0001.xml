THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 51.7th February, 1946.CABINET.SCHEME TO BRING GERMAN CHILDREN TO THIS COUNTRY.Memorandum by the Home Secretary.I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to a proposal that has recentlybeen made by Air Vice-Marshal Champion de Crespigny to bring over to thiscountry by air, for a period of six months, about 10,000 German children underthe auspices of an organisation known as the Children of Europe Air Rescue.It is intended that this voluntary body should be responsible for the whole ofthe scheme except that the R.A.F. should transport the children to and fromthis country. On arrival here, the children would be accommodated in hostelsfor a period of six weeks and would then be boarded out in private homes forthe remainder of their stay.2. The children have been among the most tragic victims of the war andtheir plight in Germany, as in every other country of Europe, naturally makes a strong appeal to our sympathies and to our traditional feelings of hospitality.I understand that, in fact, some 500 offers have already been received frompeople in this country to take German children in their houses. We are alreadylooking after Dutch children in some numbers; there are some 3,500 Dutchchildren in this country at the present time and we may receive about another10,000 more; we have welcomed here a limited number of Jewish children from german concentration camps and we are at present discussing ways and meansof bringing over some French children. Despite these prior obligations, however,I felt that the present scheme should be examined on its merits as an act of humanity on the part of this country which would make a further contribution towards the alleviation of distress in Europe. Accordingly I arranged for thescheme to be considered at a Conference of all the Government Departments whichwould be concerned with it under the Chairmanship of the Parliamentary Under -Secretary of State. -- -3. A report has now been made to me as the result of the deliberations which took place at this Conference and the difficulties of carrying out the proposals are evidently very formidable.They may be summarised as follows : 1(i) Under present conditions in Germany the selection and transport ofchildren in any great numbers to air-field reception centres as the first stage of their journey to the United Kingdom would be virtually impossible.(ii) The organisers of the scheme have been offered an ex-American militaryhospital which might take 2,000 children. Experience with theDutch children has proved, however, that for disciplinary and healthreasons not more than 350 children should be accommodated in anyone hostel. What would be required for the German children wouldbe a number of small hostels each containing some 350 children, butit would be quite impossible to secure sufficient &quot;accommodation ofthis sort under present conditions,(iii) Experience with the Dutch children has also proved that adults mustaccompany the children, not only to look after them, but to performsuch services for  them as cooking,  laundering, needlework,  &amp;c.[31278]
The ratio works out at one adult per five children and languagedifficulties necessitate the adults being of the same nationality as thechildren. We should thus be faced with the prospect of receivingin this country about 2,000 German men and women and very carefulsteps would have to be taken to prevent political undesirables fromcoining here. It is doubtful, moreover, whether public opinion,which on the whole might welcome the reception of German children,would tolerate the reception of adults.(iv) Although the Children of Europe Air Rescue is ready to take the wholeresponsibility for running the scheme, it could not, with the best willin the world, avoid falling back on the assistance of the public health authorities and local authorities generally. These bodies areuncomfortably stretched at the present time and it would be difficult toplace additional burdens upon them,(v) If all the 10,000 children require to be supplied with clothing on their arrival 1 million clothing coupons Avould be needed for them. Inaddition each child would have to be provided with 25 coupons forclothing maintenance. The issue of clothing on such a scale to Germanchildren would seriously affect the clothing situation in this country.(vi) The Children of Europe Air Rescue have not so far provided satisfactoryevidence of the fact that they are aware of what is involved in their proposals in the way of expense and in the maintenance in hostels and subsequent boarding out of the children. It is reckoned that tomaintain 10,000 children in hostels would alone cost about  85,000.We would also have to guard against any possibility of this voluntarybody tiring of its responsibilities before the operation had beencompleted, leaving His Majesty&apos;s Government faced with the prospectof returning to Germany an unknown number of German children andadults. Difficulties of this sort were experienced with the voluntarybody responsible for bringing over to this country the Basque children at the time of the Spanish Civil War.4. In addition to these practical difficulties the Foreign Office has referredto the very bad impression which would be created in every Allied country inEurope if we brought German children here. Moreover, by providing R.A.F. trans-port for them we should be doing far more for the Germans than for the Dutchor for the French who have to be responsible for their own transport. No doubt the Children of Europe Air Rescue are aware of these feelings for in Air Vice-Marshal de Crespigny&apos;s letter to me reference is made not specifically to Germanchildren but to children &quot; from Central Europe irrespective of race &quot;; however,it is quite clear that it is German children that he has in mind.The Foreign Office also point out that children in the British Zone inGermany, as the result of communal feeding arrangements, are at present as wellfed as children in many other countries in Europe.5. I have carefully considered the scheme in the light of these variousdifficulties and in all the circumstances I have veluct&amp;iitliy come to the conclusionthat His Majesty&apos;s Government ought not to agree to it. I have already referredto the welcome that we are giving to Dutch, French and Jewish children at thepresent time; throughout the war years this country has extended its traditionalhospitality to many thousands of victims of Nazi aggression; we have recently announced a scheme to bring to this country relatives and dependants (includingchildren) of aliens here already who are in distressed circumstances abroad; wecannot, therefore, I think, be accused of not playing our full part in the relief of distress in Europe. / propose, therefore, subject to the agreement of mycolleagues, to inform Air Vice-Marshal de Crespigny of our attitude and toexplain to him why we find ourselves unable to agree to his proposals.J. C. E.Home Office, S.W. 1, 7th February, 1946.
