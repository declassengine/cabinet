T3 DOCUMENT  iS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S GOVERNMENT)S E C R &apos;J TC?, (1.6)30 COPY NO,  JjJL2 7TM FEBRUARY,   19ko-CABINETVORLD FOOD SUPPLIESPROPOSED MISSION TO NORTH AMERICAMemorandum &quot;by the Lord President .of the Council-At the meeting of Ministers on Pood Suppliesyesterday,     I was   invited to submit more specific proposals for the suggested mission to North America-2o The prime ohject of this mission would be toproduce as large an increase as possible in targetacreages to he sown with wheat in North America (withconcurrent action in other countries)  in the few weeksremaining before it is too late for this year&apos;s harvest *On the best available estimate the world needs 20 millionextra acres to he sown,  over and above current targets^Dividing this acreage proportionately between the three main exporters which we can hope effectively to influence,the target would he roughly an extra 1J million acresfrom U - S - A-- ,   k-i million acres from Canada and. 2% million acres from Australia-3- Farmers will he much more willing to make thisemergency increase in acreage if they are sure of aprofitable market for a reasonahle period ahead,,      So faras the crop year lyk-G/j is concerned,   there should be nodifficulty in demonstrating the existence of a satisfactorymarket for every ton of wheat that can he grown.      Growerswill;,  however,   also need some assurance for 194-7/8^      Itis suggested that such an assurance could be given withoutany serious disadvantage in the following shape:-(i)  Securing acceptance for forward demand and supplyestimates demonstrating the prohahiiity of continuing shortage of wheat and rice in consumingareas. .(ii) Emphasizing the need for large quantities sf wheat to rebuild the exhausted carryover stocks in allcountries&quot;(iii) Undertaking by the United Ki.ii.rdom to supportexisting wheat prices up to December pi,   1947  (andto co-operate in a achaiTie of lorig-term purchases from our selected suppliers^   if it can be shown tohe necessary in order to secure increased sowingson the scale the world run.; el a) *(iv) Undertaking by the Government of India, assuming that they accept the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals to constitute a famine reserve of say J million tons as soon as wheat not required for immediatecons ump tic-n is av a i I ah 1 e..

-    1154&quot; In addition,   it is suggested that the UoS.Import-Export Bank should &quot;be asked to guarantee loans forthe purchase of wheat either to particular prospectiveimporting countries,  or in the form of a general pool,should this he necessary,   in order to provide a sufficientinducement to united States growers in particular-      It isalso proposed that the French Government should he approachedand invited to join with the United Kingdom in undertaking to support existing prices up to the end of 19:4-7 and to look to the United States as their source of supply.-.Should the French do so a valuable additional forwardcommitment would have &quot;been secured;    should they refuse,their claim for favourable treatment on spot supplies would, be correspondingly weakened.5 - The United States administration is understood tobe deeply concerned and to he ready to respond to suggestions of this nature^  provided they are forcefully put across at a sufficiently high levelc      For this purpose it appearsimpossible to escape the conclusion that a mmmt minister should make a short visit to Washington and Ottawa in thevery near future,  and invite the United States and canadian government&apos;s to lay cn their Agricultural Departments the task of raising their target acreages (as proposed in paragraph 2)as an indispensable contribution to world order-6o It is proposed that the Minister should heaccompanied by senior representatives of the Ministries of &quot;food and Agriculture-      He should be authorised to suggest to both the U- 8-  and Canadian Governments that the Food and agriculture Organisation should he moved to initiate,   as amatter cf great urgency,  a propaganda campaign to whip uprenewed interest in the contribution which world farmerscould make towards world settlement,  through a successfulcampaign this spring,   against famineo      For this purpose the Food and Agriculture Organisation would need, to recruita team of knowledgeable agriculturists who could addressfarmers in the big exporting countries on the world situation under the auspices of an international organisation^The Minister could say that the U* K*  Government would beVery happy,   if invited,   to find two or three members for - sucha team-Jo It does not appear desirable to send overadministrative officers or representatives of the grain tradeto the wheat centres-      Personal contact with farmers is theimportant  consideration and this can only be  effectivelyachieved by agricultural spokesmen.8.- We alft satisfied that a mission on these linescould he of decisive importance -    %jT.dq not consider thatthe problem can he effectively tackled at any other level?9- I therefore invite the Cabinet to agree that ai^iiwinuiw Minister should make an urgent visit to washington and Ottawa for the purposes outlined in this memorandum-Office of the Lord Presidentof the Council,2 71 h F eh r u a r y,   19 k &amp;
