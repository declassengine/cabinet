(46) 56.8th February, 1946.CABINET.Service Divorce Cases.FIRST INTERIM REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON reform of LEGAL PROCEDURE.28Copy No.   O 6Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.FOLLOWING a discussion in Cabinet on the 20th September, 1945 (CM.(45) 34th Conclusion, Minute 2), the Prime Minister approved the appointment ofa Committee of Ministers under my Chairmanship, composed of the Home Secre-tary, the Minister of Health, the Minister of Education, the Minister of Town and country Planning, the Lord Advocate, the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, with the following terms of reference : &apos;&apos; To consider whether there are grounds for an enquiry into the systemof administering civil justice in Great Britain, with a view to reducing thecost of litigation; and to make recommendations to the Cabinet regardingthe scope of any such enquiry and the means by which it could best be carriedout.The Committee will, in particular, consider whether there is need fora special enquiry into the costs and delays involved in divorce proceedings;and may, if desired, make an interim report to the Cabinet on this aspect ofthe matter.&quot;2. The Committee gave first attention to the question of divorce procedure,as the most urgent of the problems before it, and have, after consideration, agreedthat as a first step an Interim Report should be submitted to the Cabinet on theserious situation which may arise in the near future with regard to ServiceDivorce Cases, and on their recommendations for dealing with it.3. I therefore submit, for consideration by my colleagues, the attached FirstInterim Report of the Committee. In view of the urgent need to take action to expedite the preparation of the (approximately) 36,000 Service cases which havenow accumulated, and to strengthen the judicial machinery to deal with themwhen ready, I should appreciate an early decision of the Cabinet on theCommittee&apos;s recommendations.   These may be summarised as follows : (1) that, as regards the preparation of Service cases : -(a) the task of preparation should continue to be the responsibility ofthe Services Divorce Department of the Law Society, and theprocedure should be simplified by dispensing with the necessityfor the formal issue of a poor persons certificate by the PoorPersons Committee of the Law Society (paragraphs 9 ana 10of the Report);(&amp;) the Cabinet should authorise the Minister of Works to provide accommodation for the Services Divorce Department on thescale mentioned in paragraph 10 (a) of the Report as a matterof high priority:;(c) the Cabinet should invite the Minister of Labour and NationalService to consider means for supplying the Services DivorceDepartment with the requisite staff in London and in theProvinces (paragraph 10 (b));(d) the cost of the expanded service of the Services Divorce Depart-ment should be met out of public funds (paragraph 10 (c)).[31273] b
(2) that, as a temporary means of enabling the judicial machinery to be expanded, the Lord Chancellor be authorised to advise His majesty o appoint Commissioners of Assize in exercise of the powers available under s. 70 of the Judicature Act, 1925, as soon as the situation at the Courts demands (paragraph 13).4. At their Meeting on the 20th September (CM. (45) 34th Conclusions,Minute 2 (1)), the Cabinet recommended that I should appoint one or more permanent judges to deal with divorce cases as soon as it appeared that thenumber of existing judges was likely to be insufficient to deal with the volume ofcases coming forward. But, after further consideration, I have come to theconclusion that it would be preferable, for the reasons given in paragraph 13 ofthe Report, to make use of the powers available to appoint Commissioners ofAssize.J.House of Lords, S. W. 1,8th February, 1946.SERVICE DIVORCE CASES.First Interim Report of the Committee on the Reform of Legal Procedure.1. The second paragraph of our Terms of Reference empowers us to make an Interim Report on the delays and costs involved in divorce proceedings. a tour first meeting the Lord Chancellor drew attention to the situation whichhas arisen as regards the divorce cases now being brought by men and women who have been serving in the Forces during the war. We thereupon decided togive this matter immediate consideration. As a result we are satisfied thata problem of such grave urgency has arisen as to merit a special Interim Reportto the Cabinet limited to Service divorce cases. Our recomendations withregard to Service divorce cases are set out in paragraphs 11 and 14 below. in later reports we shall be making recommendations about divorce proceedingsgenerally, and about other matters arising on our Terms of Reference as awhole.2. By Service divorce cases are meant those in which the petitioner is a manor women serving in the Forces, or who has served in the Forces during the war,and who is suing for divorce under one or other of the Services Legal AidSchemes. We are satisfied that the delays now occurring in disposing of thesecases are such as to involve great hardship to the individuals concerned, andthat unless immediate steps are taken to remedy matters a serious public outcrywill inevitably result.3. We emphasise that the problem is one of delay; and that, at the moment,the delay is occurring in the preparation of the cases, not in disposing of them at the Courts. The cost of a Service divorce case to the individual concerned is not a cause for complaint the average cost is of the order of  5 to  10. Butthe delays are such that cases now take from 2\ to Z\ years and, what is mostserious of all, the existing machinery for preparing the cases is utterlyinadequate to the demand. There are now some 36,000 pending Service cases in various stages of preparation. Under present conditions it is estimated that not more than 4,500 of these cases can be disposed of in 1946. Many of them have already been waiting more than two years, and some of the cases now being set down for hearing in the Courts originated early in 1943.j The Service Legal Aid Schemes.4. There are separate Legal Aid Schemes for the three Services.&apos; TheArmy and R.A.F. schemes are integrated, and the Navy scheme does not differmaterially from the other two. It will be sufficient to describe the operation ofthe Army scheme.A Service man (or woman) who wants a divorce goes in the first place tohis Comanding Officer.   The Commanding Officer sends the man to a special
Army legal organisation called a Command Legal Aid Section. The Legal AidSection examine the case, take statements from witnesses, get the papers inorder, and then send them to the Poor Persons Committee of the Law Society.The Committee consider wdiether the applicant has a prima facie case and is within the Services Legal Aid Scheme, and then pass the case to the ServicesDivorce Department of the Law Society. This department consists of a numberof whole-time salaried solicitors (each with a staff of clerks), and the case isallocated to one of them, who then conducts the case as solicitor for the applicant.5. The Services schemes are open to all men and women who, at the dateof their application for legal aid, w.ere serving in the Forces in the rank ofsergeant, petty officer, or flight sergeant, or below. Once the case has been taken up by the Command Legal Aid Section, a man&apos;s subsequent demobilisation doesnot withdraw him from the benefits of the scheme. The possession of large privatemeans in addition to Service pay excludes.The scheme covers legal advice and assistance in litigation. So far as it relates to litigation, it is, in its essentials, an adaptation of the ordinary poorpersons procedure. The chief difference is that the rigid income limits do notapply, but the test of rank is substituted. Special Rules of Court relate to Servicecases. The present requirement that the service man or woman seeking a divorcethrough the scheme has to satisfy a Poor Persons Committee that he or shefulfils the test of rank, and has a reasonable cause of action, is prescribed byRule, which can be altered at any time.The Present Position.6. From July 1942 to the end of 1945 over 43,000 applications for divorcehad been made to the Command Legal Aid Sections (at home and overseas).During the same period 5,198 decrees nisi had been obtained for petitionersproceeding under the scheme. In 1945 some 20,000 decrees nisi were pronouncedby the Courts : of these only 3,000 odd were Service cases. As already statedthere are now over 36,000 pending Service cases, including those which havebeen entered at the Courts but not yet heard.Delays exist at all points in the operation of the scheme. On the1st January, 1946, the position was as follows:  (1) At the Command Legal Aid Sections. There were about 14,350divorce cases pending in the Sections at home and overseas, i.e.; cases whichhad not then been passed to the Law Society. There have undoubtedly been serious delays in the Sections in the past. We heard of several instances where applications were made to the Sections as long ago as September 1942or earlier and, for one reason or another, the case has not yet even gone tothe Law Society. It is said that applications now being made to the Sec-tions are usually passed to the Law Society within two or three months.We hope this is accurate. There is a grave risk that delays may recur ifthe war establishments of the Sections are not kept up (by the provisionof new serving solicitors and managing clerks to replace those who aredemobilised). Cases are still coming into the Sections, but it is estimatedthat the peak of the intake may now be over.(2) At the Poor Persons Committee of the Law Society. The delay atthis stage is at present between nine months and one year, i.e., that periodelapses between the date when the case is transmitted to the Poor PersonsCommittee from the Command Legal Aid Section and the date when thesub-committee of the Poor Persons Committee adjudicates on the applica-tion. The Poor Persons Committee consists of a number of London solicitorswho are members of the Law Society, and who do this work gratuitously.In 80 per cent, of the Service cases which reach the Poor Persons Com-mittee the application is granted, and a poor persons certificate is issued.It by no means follows that in the other 20 per cent, of the cases leaveis refused. Sometimes the application is put back for further information and sometimes the applicant, becoming exasperated by the delays, withdrawshis application, and tries to raise sufficient money to employ an independentsolicitor.On the 1st January the Poor Persons Committee had more than 14,000applications awaiting consideration, and new applications are still reachingthem at the daily rate of 64 (annual rate 23,360).   The Committee have more[31273] b 2
than 3,000 cases in which poor persons certificates have been granted, but which have not yet been passed to the Services Divorce Department, becausethe latter Department cannot absorb them at present.(3) At the Services Divorce Department Stage. This Department had10,300 cases in hand. Of these, 3,000 were cases in which a decree nisi hadbeen pronounced, but the cases were not finally disposed of. A case takeson the average nine to twelve months from the date on which it is passed to the Department to the date on which a decree nisi is pronounced.7. There were thus over 24,000 Service divorce cases in the two organisations for which the Law Society is responsible, and it is plain that a very serious bottle-neck exists there. This is due (1) to the fact that the scheme has developed to an extent far greater than was originally contemplated; (2) to the impossibilityhitherto of finding an adequate staff of solicitors, managing clerks, andparticularly shorthand-typists, for the two organisations. The Command legal aid Sections are sending cases to the Poor Persons Committee at a rate far greater than they can be absorbed by the Committee or by the Service DivorceDepartment. The result is that the arrears are simply accumulating at an increasing rate in the two Law Society organisations.8. We consider that the Government are under a special obligation to seethat the young men and women who have been serving in the Forces during thewar and whose marriages have unhappily broken down are resettled in life assoon as possible. Apart from that consideration, the existence in society of alarge number&apos; of ill-adjusted individuals is most undesirable, and the presentlong delays must inevitably result in the formation of numbers of irregularunions and other social evils. We consider that the object should be to dispose of the whole mass of Service cases within two years from now. There are two things to be done : (1) The rate of preparation of Service cases must be speeded up.(2) Adequate judicial machinery must be provided to ensure that when thecases reach the Courts they will be expeditiously disposed of.Preparation of the Cases.9. The procedure governing Service cases must be simplified and themachinery for preparing the cases must be improved and greatly expanded. Asto procedure, we understand that a number of reforms (all designed to expeditematters) are now being instituted by the President of the Divorce Division, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor. In particular it is proposed that thenecessity of the formal issue of a poor persons certificate by the Poor PersonsCommittee of the Law Society see paragraph 6 (2) above should be dispensed with in Service cases. We consider that this should be done. The duty ofcertifying that a prima facie^ case exists and that the applicant is within theScheme should be performed by the Command Legal Aid Sections, and the case should go direct from the Sections to the Services Divorce Department for assign-ment to a conducting solicitor. Thus one of the steps in the present process wouldbe cut out altogether. This change, to which the President of the DivorceDivision and the Law Society are agreeable, could be effected by Rule of Courtwith Treasury approval.10. As to machinery, we have already pointed out that the Services DivorceDepartment of the Law Society as at present constituted is incapable of handling the mass of cases. On the other hand, we have been informed that given large increases in staff and accommodation (and assuming that there is adequatejudicial machinery to dispose of the cases when they reach the Courts) the LaAvSociety have declared their ability to dispose of 20,000 Service cases per annumthrough the Services Divorce Department. We consider that it is better to buildon existing foundations rather than start an entirely new system, and that theLaw Society ought to continue to handle the cases.&quot; But it is plain that theGovernment should do everything possible to enable them to fulfil their task. Thematter is one (a) of accommodation; (b) of staff; (c) of finance.(a) Accommodation. The Services Divorce Department are about totake over some new premises in Clement&apos;s Inn. There is some delay inmaking these premises ready, and the Ministry of Works and the Ministryof Labour have already been approached in regard to this!   The expansion
of the Department will necessitate the provision of another office building, oftwice the capacity of the Clement&apos;s Inn premises. This building should notbe too far away from the Law Courts. Smaller premises will also be required at various Provincial centres, to hold the branch offices of the Departmentwhich it is proposed to set up to deal with the cases at Assizes. This may cause difficulty, as the accommodation in the larger Provincial towns is aslimited as it is in London. These premises (and the requisite fittings andfurnishings) cannot be acquired without Government aid.(b) Staff. The present establishment of the Services Divorce Department&quot;is as follows : There are 9 Units, each consisting of one solicitor, and a staff of15; an Assize Section; an Accounts and Costs Section; a Post-Decree NisiSection; and a small Headquarters Section. The total establishment is179 persons. At present the Department is short of its establishment by82 persons- of these 55 are shorthand-typists and typists.To discharge the task to be imposed on them the Law Society will needan additional establishment of 26 Units, of which 18 will be set up in theProvinces. This will involve an additional staff of 26 solicitors and 420 otherpersonnel. Of these 208 must be shorthand-typists and 52 typists; thus thetotal number of shorthand-typists and typists&quot; required to bring the Depart-ment up to its full strength on the new establishment will be 315. We mentionshorthand-typists and typists specifically because they are the most difficultpersonnel to find-. The Law Society can (subject to what is said below as tosalaries) find the solicitors and the clerks. But the Minister of Labour, whokindly attended one of our meetings, has suggested that a special training scheme may have to be started if the girls are to be provided in the numbers required.As to salaries, the Law Society suggest that the present rates of remuneration of their salaried solicitors should be increased from  750 atpresent to a scale of  800 to  1,000, in order that men of the right type maybe attracted. Further, the Society suggest that the present salaries payable to their shorthand-typists and typists (though superior to Government rates)are insufficient to prevent girls leaving their employment for more lucrativeengagements elsewhere.(c) Finance. The Law Society cannot undertake the required expansionof the Services Divorce Department except on the footing that the Govern-ment will bear the expense. The Treasury have recently agreed to finance theDepartment on its present establishment. The annual cost of financing theDepartment as now proposed to be expanded would be of the order of 170,000, to which must be added a further sum in respect of Counsel&apos;s feesfor conducting undefended cases, which, as we are at present advised, may be calculated at  30,000. We consider that there are good reasons for asking the State to bear the cost. The Rushcliffe scheme, if finally adopted by theGovernment, will involve the Exchequer in a heavy annual charge; if that scheme were now in operation most of the Service cases could be disposed of under the Rushcliffe machinery. The expanded Services Divorce department is an ad hoc expedient to bridge the gap before Rushcliffe can be brought intoeffect by legislation and otherwise.11. As regards the preparation of the Service cases our recommendations are as follows : (1) the task of preparation should be left to the Law Society;(2) the Cabinet should authorise the Minister of Works to provide accom-modation for the Services Divorce Department on the scale mentionedabove as a matter of high priority;(3) the Cabinet should invite the Minister of Labour and National service to consider means for supplying the Services Divorce Departmentwith the requisite staff in London and in the Provinces;(4) the cost of the expanded service of the Services Divorce department should be met out of public funds.Judicial Machinery.12. It is useless to accelerate the rate of preparation of cases if the only result is to create a bottleneck at the Courts. We repeat that there is little or no delay in hearing Service cases in the Courts at present, for the reason thatthey are not being prepared fast enough.   But the President of the Divorce
Division has reported to the Lord Chancellor that the judicial machine is already-working to full capacity to deal with existing cases, the great majority of whichare not Service cases. If Service cases are prepared at the greatly acceleratedrate now proposed, the judicial machine will break down. The matter is bestexplained by some figures.In 1944 18,969 petitions for divorce were filed; and the Courts disposed of15,171. In 1945 the figures were (approximately) 25,000 petitions filed and20,000 cases disposed of. Taking into account the possibility of war marriagesbreaking up within the next year or two (as they did after the last war) and assuming that we succeed in arranging for the Service cases now being preparedto be made ready for hearing at the rate of 15,000 per annum, it is estimated thatthe Courts may be faced with more than 30,000 petitions in each of the next threeyears.13. We have considered various means whereby the judicial machinerymight be improved, not only to deal with the immediate problem of the Servicecases, but to provide a better method of disposing of matrimonial proceedings inthe Courts of Justice. In a later Report we shall be making recommendationsdealing generally with this matter. So far as the immediate problem of Servicecases is concerned, we have borne in mind the futility of recommending any solu-tion which would require legislation this Session, because we are informed thatno Parliamentary time could be found for a Bill dealing with divorce, howeverurgent. The Cabinet have already authorised the Lord Chancellor to recommend the appointment of more permanent Divorce Judges when the volume of casesrequired additional judicial strength (CM. (45) 34th Conclusions, Minute 2 (1)).But Ave do not, however, recommend the adoption of that course at present, as itwould involve an addition to the permanent strength of the Divorce Divisionbefore the long-term policy for divorce is finally settled and more especially aswithout legislation only one additional judge can be appointed. As a purely temporary expedient we think that Commissioners of Assize should be appointedby His Majesty in exercise of the special powers conferred on him by s. 70 ofthe Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925, which is quoted in the Appendix to this Report. The Commissioners would be in the main King&apos;sCounsel, who- would sit in London and in the Provinces. Each Commissioner,when sitting, would constitute a High Court and have all the powers of a HighCourt Judge. We are informed that this method commends itself to the lord chief Justice and to the President. It will involve the. payment of remunerationto the Commissioners, and some extension of the staff of the Divorce Registryin London and of the District Registries will be involved. It may also be necessaryto find temporary additional accommodation for the Divorce Registry in London.. 14. We consider that the proposal to appoint Commissioners is a satisfac-tory solution of the immediate problem, to take effect until a long-term policy canbe formulated and the necessary legislation passed. We, therefore, recommendthat, as a temporary means of enabling the judicial machinery to be expanded, theLord Chancellor be authorised to advise Pfis Majesty to appoint commissioners in exercise of the powers available under s. 70 of the Judicature Act. 1925, as soonas the situation at the Courts demands.Signed on behalf of the Committee,JOWITT.Chairman.6th February, 19-46.APPENDIX.Commis-sions ofassize andjurisdictionof eGiniiiis-skmevs.Section 70 of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act, 1925.Circuits and Assizes.either0.
