(46) 54.12th February, 1946.CABINET.GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SERVICES.Note by the Lord President of the Council.AT their meeting on the 6th December, 1945 (CM. (45) 60th Meeting,Conclusion 6), the Cabinet invited me to arrange for a Committee of officials to work out the details of an alternative organisation to the Ministry ofInformation on the general lines indicated in my report on government information Services (CP. (45) 316).2. I circulate herewith for the consideration of my colleagues the reportof the Official Committee.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council,S.W.1,12th February, 1946.[31291a]

Copy No.Note by the Chairman.AT their meeting on the 6th December, 1945,* the Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Ministry of Information should not continue as aseparate Department under its own Minister.(2) Agreed that it was essential to retain some effective central organisation to handle Government publicity; and invited the Lord President toarrange for a Committee of officials to work out the details of analternative organisation on the general lines indicated in his Report, t2. The report of this Committee is attached. It has been generally agreed between interested Departments at the official level subject to the points set outin the following paragraphs.3. Economies of man-power and expenditure and a greater all-roundefficiency may be expected from the creation of a central Government InformationOffice, which Departments will be required (subject to agreed exceptions) touse for the common services defined in paragraph 50 and Annex 1, and whichitself will be required to function on the request and under the policy directionof the Ministers responsible in the various fields. Certain Ministers, however,still have information responsibilities of an emergency or highly specialisednature, largely arising from war conditions. While these exceptional circum-stances persist, and while the Government Information Office is being organised,it may well be necessary to leave in the hands of certain Departments, on a tem-porary basis and by mutual agreement, certain information functions which, by common consent, belong to the Government Information Office in principle. TheMinistry of Food publicity in connection with rationing is the largest example.The need for such interim exceptions should, in the view of the official Com-mittee, be satisfactorily met, without any departure in principle from the scheme,by suitable use of the &apos;&apos; escape clause &apos;&apos; (paragraph 6 of the Report) under which departments which can satisfy the Treasury (and where necessary the appro-priate Information Services Committee) that they can best perform for themselvescertain tasks within the scope of the Government Information Office will be free to &quot; contract out &quot; within limits to be agreed in each case. It is not, therefore,considered necessary to submit to the Cabinet the various pending claims toexceptional treatment for the Ministries of Food and Agriculture, the service departments and others. It is considered that no undue difficulty should bemet in dealing with these claims through the machinery provided in paragraph 2.With this right to &quot;contract out&quot; where the case is proved for it, and withthe right of the client Department to have the exclusive say on policy and to reject publicity which in its view would cause it public embarrassment, weconsider that the interests of user Departments in the new common service areadequately safeguarded. To go further would seriously undermine the basicdecision to handle publicity as a common service.4. On two important questions the Committee have not been able to reachunanimous conclusions and accordingly present alternatives for the decision ofMinisters.  These are : (i) The Ministerial responsibility for the B.B.C. and the location of thestaff necessary for the work involved, t See paragraphs 17 to 29 ofthe Report.(ii) The future of the British Council see paragraphs 30 to 42 of theReport.* CM. (45) 60th Meeting, Conclusion 6. t CP. (45) 316.$ Cf. CM. (45) 63rd Conclusions, Item 2.[31291] bREPORT OF THE OFFICIAL COMMITTEE ON government information SERVICES.
5. There are three questions within the Committee&apos;s purview on which norecommendations are submitted.   These are : (i) The future of War-time Social Survey.   This is still under considera-tion in consultation with the Departments concerned,(ii) The future of the broadcasting and communications work undertaken by the Ministry of Information other than that throAvn up by rela-tions with the B.B.C.  This may better be discussed by the Radio and cable Board.(iii) The question of exercising closer control over the expenditure of theB.B.C. The Committee have not completed their consideration ofthis, and will shortly report separately on it.(Signed) J. A. BARLOW.Treasury Chambers, S.

Liquidation of the Ministry of Information and disposal of its Functions.Basis of Agreed Policy.1. The basic policy agreed by Ministers was summed up in the lord presidents memorandum appended to CP. (45) 316 in the following terms : (a) Overseas publicity must be continued in peace time.(b) Subject to vigilance against abuse by the Government of the day, provi-sion must be made for the continuance of Government information and publicity services at home.(c) The Minister concerned should be responsible for the publicity of his department, and Departmental Public Relations or InformationDivisions, whose staffs should be strictly limited in numbers but should be of good status and quality, should continue as the primaryinstrument for Departmental publicity and for keeping Ministers and departments in touch with public opinion.
(d) There should be a single organisation which might be called theGovernment Information Office* to carry out centrally certaincommon technical and production functions and make specialist services available to Departments. This Office should be availablefor both overseas and home purposes. It should not be under closeday-to-day direction by a Minister appointed exclusively for thepurpose, though there would have to be a responsible Minister towhom the Office could go for guidance as and when required.(e) There should be machinery for the co-ordination of both overseas and home publicity, so that the different Departments concerned with over-seas publicity present a &quot; common line,&quot; which, where necessary, is related to home publicity, and so that, as far as possible, publicity athome is consistent and overlapping and conflict are avoided. Thehome Departments must clearly make their contribution to the presentation abroad of the British way of life and British institutions.(/) For political as well as financial reasons, there should be a substantial reduction in the total Government expenditure on different kinds of publicity.The Ministerial and Official Information Services Committees and theirSecretariat.2. The new structure will be headed by two Ministerial Committees for home and Overseas Information Services respectively, which will have a commonChairman and will meet jointly to deal with matters of common interest, supportedby two Official Committees. It is not intended that day-to-day matters whichcan be settled by ordinary interdepartmental consultation should be brought before these Committees.  Their terms of reference and composition might be: (a) Home Information Services (Ministerial).&apos;&apos; To keep under review problems of Government information policy andthe working of Government information services within the United Kingdomand to consider such other related problems as may be referred to it by theCabinet.For these purposes to meet jointly with the Overseas Information Services(Ministerial) Committee whenever convenient.&apos;&apos;Membership. Non-departmental Minister (Chairman), Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, President of the Board of Trade, and a few other Ministers,especially those whose departmental policy is of immediate public interestand those who have special personal knowledge of publicity matters. other ministers would be invited to attend for discussion of matters affecting their departmental interests.(b) Overseas Information Services (Ministerial).&quot; To keep under review problems of British Government informationpolicy and the working of British Government information services overseas,and to consider such other related&apos; problems as may be referred to it by theCabinet.For these purposes to meet jointly with the Home Information Services(Ministerial) Committee whenever convenient.&quot;Membership. Non-departmental Minister (Chairman), Secretaries ofState for Foreign Affairs, India and Burma, Colonies and Dominion Affairs,Chancellor of the Exchequer, and President of the Board of Trade.(c) Home Information Services (Official).&quot;Under the policy direction of the Home Information Services(Ministerial) Committee to review and co-ordinate, where necessary, inter-departmental action on problems of Government information and the workingof Government information services within the United Kingdom.* This is the title recommended by the present Committee. It is also recommended that,the title for use abroad should be &quot; United Kingdom Government Information Office &quot;, but that-in the United States of America the title &quot; British Information Service &quot; should be retained.[31291] b 2
Membership. Head of G.I.O. (Chairman), Public Relations Adviser to&apos; the Prime Minister, and representatives of the Treasury, Board of Trade,Home Office, Scottish Office, Ministry of Labour and National Service,Ministry of Health, Ministry of Food, Ministry of Education, Ministry of fuel and Power, Ministry of War Transport and His Majesty&apos;s stationery office.*(d) Overseas Information Services [Official).&quot; Under the policy direction of the Overseas Information Services(Ministerial) Committee to review and co-ordinate, where necessary, inter-departmental action on problems of British Government information and theworking of British information services overseas.&quot;Membership. -Foreign Office representative (Chairman), Head of G.I.O.,Public Relations Adviser to the Prime Minister and representatives of theTreasury, Board of Trade, Dominions, Colonial, India and Burma Offices.*3. Secretariat. The two Ministerial and Official Committees on Home and overseas Information Services respectively will require secretarial assistance which, in the interests both of economy and of the fullest co-ordination, will beprovided by a common secretariat. This secretariat will be provided by theG.I.O., but in the case of the two Ministerial Committees the Cabinet Offices may provide a joint secretary. It will be the responsibility of Departments to see thatthe secretariat is kept fully informed of (and where appropriate consulted upon)all relevant developments in the field of the Committees. In the case of overseas information services this will best be secured by adoption of a recognised prefixfor official communications in this field, which can then be automatically circu-lated to the secretariat and to Departmental representatives concerned, as has beendone in the case of, e.g., North America, Russia and Middle East Supplies bysimilar non-departmental secretariats.4. Relations between Departments and the Official Committees. Appro-priate arrangements should be made for Departments not represented on theOfficial Committees to send representatives whenever matters of concern to the mare under consideration.Duties of Departmental Information Branches.5. Departmental Information Divisions or Branches! will be the mechanismfor advising Ministers on the handling of information problems within theirfield and the channel for explaining their requirements and passing their demands to the G.I.O. The aim should be to keep these Divisions or Branches small andof good quality, and they should rely on the G.I.O. for the actual preparationof most information material. Departmental Information Divisions should bestaffed with people of ideas and initiative. Although the status of information officers of different Departments will not necessarily be identical, in many Depart-ments it is important that the head of the Division should be of first-rate&apos; quality,and that it should be recognised that he should have access, no less than any otherhead of Division, to his Permanent Secretary and, where necessary, the minister himself. These men cannot do their work properly if they are kept out of allpolicy-making discussions and deprived of any real contact with their Ministerand the principal administrative officers of their Department. It should always be remembered that they have a double function interpretation of the Depart-ment to the public and, no less important, the interpretation of public feeling tothe Department, both in advance of and after decisions on a policy.Use by Departments of the G.I.O.6. Departments will be expected to use the services of the G.I.O. formatters within its scope (defined in paragraph 50 below as amplified by Annex I).If they consider, however, that particular tasks within that scope can better be performed by them than by the G.I.O., they will be free to make proposals tothis effect.   Such proposals will often be made in the course of seeking Treasury* Departmental Information Officers or other representatives according to the nature of theparticular agenda.f It is proposed that &quot; Information &quot; should be generally substituted for the term &quot; public relations &quot; except in those Departments which, for reasons of goodwill, may particularly wishto retain the latter title.
authority for the expenditure; in these cases, if the Treasury, after consulting; theG.I.O. if necessary, are satisfied that there is no objection, the proposal will beauthorised; but in the case of any difference of view, or in any case sufficientlyimportant to make such a course desirable, the matter will be referred to theappropriate Official Information Services Committee. Important cases will haveto be referred to the appropriate Ministerial Committee.Home Information Services.7. In general, the relation between Home Departmental Information Officersand the G.I.O. would be similar to that of the corresponding Public RelationsOfficers with the Ministry of Information subject to one important change.The Home Information Services (Official) Committee would, when desired by Departments, include Departmental Information Officers who would thussit on the immediate supervising body of the G.I.O. and have an overall picture of its line of development.8. On home publicity matters of interdepartmental scope it will open tothe G.I.O. to propose themes in consultation with the Public Relations adviser to the Prime Minister.Overseas Information Services.9. The basic object of British overseas information is to ensure the presen-tation overseas of a true and adequate picture of British policy, British institu-tions and the British way of life. More specific tasks include bringing before thepeople of overseas countries the advantages of trade with Britain and the achieve-ments of British industry, science and art.10.   In carrying out this function it is necessary to reconcile the needs : -(a) For the Foreign Office (and the Departments responsible in other fields)to be able to ensure that the development of publicity is at all stagesbased on and closely linked with policy;(b) For His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadors, Ministers, Colonial Governors andother chief territorial representatives and authorities overseas to haveultimate control over any British official publicity put out within their area;(c) To ensure at the policy level that the British case is presented coherentlyand efficiently; and(d) To ensure at the production level that the greater efficiency and economy of an integrated publicity machine is not lost.11. The broad outlines to be followed by official publicity will in future beagreed inter-departmentally through the Ministerial and Official Committees forthis purpose. The application and timing in each field and the meeting of special needs in each field will be the responsibility of the Department concerned (and ofits chief representative in the area). The supply of satisfactory material to meet these needs and the maintenance where necessary of a small picked staff able tounderstand and interpret them to the various specialised production branches willbe the resjjonsibility of the G.I.O.12. The requirements of overseas Departments for finished publicitymaterials will be met by the G.I.O. within its functions as defined in paragraph 50below. The quality of these materials must be very high if they are to achieve their purpose. It is therefore essential that the G.I.O. should be staffed by peopleof lively imagination and intelligence and high technical competence and that theyshould be encouraged to display initiative. While, therefore, the overseas department must be in a position to tell the G.I.O. of their requirements, and to lay down the objective and outline the subject matter and general conto-nt of afilm, a pamphlet or a series of posters, it must be open to the G.I.O. to make suggestions concerning the suitability of the medium chosen for the purpose inhand, and to give the appropriate technical advice on its treatment. It should be,in short, an organisation with ideas.13. In addition to such finished publicity material, the Overseas Depart-ments will need to ensure that their posts abroad are provided with a supplyof information in various forms, including a daily cabled or wireless service.This should include a flow of material supplied in the main by the Board of trade on commercial and industrial subjects. It is important that such a service should be prepared under close supervision to ensure that it is in accord with
current policy. Needs vary not only between Empire and foreign countries, butbetween one foreign country and another. Nevertheless, it is evident that therewill be important elements of the service, such as texts of official statements, orsummaries of Parliamentary proceedings, Avhich are of equal utility in manyEmpire and foreign countries. Moreover, there are technical advantages in main-taining a common service. The need is at present met by the London Press Serviceof the Ministry of Information. This Service and the associated referencefacilities should be continued, with some curtailment of activity, in the G..I.and, to ensure the closest policy control, the editors of the two programmes chiefly concerned with policy (diplomatic and economic) should be appointed in consulta-tion with the Foreign Office and the Board of Trade respectively. the predominant overall concern of the Foreign Office as largest user should berecognised by an arrangement under which the Head of the Service is appointedby agreement with the Foreign Secretary and is replaced if his agreement iswithheld.14. The information officers at posts abroad will be at the disposal of their colleagues of the Foreign Service and Trade Commissioner Service who are dealingwith commercial matters, for the purpose of promoting British trade and industry.In a number of important posts special Economic Information Officers may berequired for this purpose. In general, publicity work in foreign countries shouldbe incorporated in the Foreign Service, but this will be a slow process; technicallyspecialised officers would be obtained by the Overseas Departments through theG.I.O.15. Officers of the G.I.O. would be transferred where necessary to the overseas Departments to fill appointments on their establishment abroad. Officersof the G.I.O. may, however, from time to time visit overseas posts to advise onthe conduct of technical functions. Provision should be made for overseas information officers to have periods of service in the G.I.O. at home, so that theycan widen their technical knowledge and have first-hand experience of the centralmachine.16. In addition to the common overseas publicity service which will beprovided for Departments by the G.I.O. there will be additional overseas publicityfunctions which a particular Overseas Department will wish to initiate in itsown territory. As a general principle, the services provided by the G.I.O. shouldbe used in all publicity matters except those where the Department concernedcan itself carry out the work equally or more efficiently with proper regard to reasonable economy.Ministerial Responsibility for the B.B.C.Introduction.17. The Committee were asked to make recommendations on this matter,to which preliminary consideration was given by the Ministerial broadcasting committee under the Coalition Government; but they have been unable to reach a unanimous conclusion.18. The Ullswater Committee recommended that responsibility be assigned to a senior Minister without departmental responsibilities : this was turned downby the Government of the day, and before the Avar responsibility rested with thePostmaster-General. During the war the Postmaster-General has retained hispre-war functions under the Charter and his functions on technical matters under.. the Licence and Agreement supplementary to the Charter; but other functions,including functions specially exercisable in time of emergency, have been trans-ferred to the Minister of Information, who has also been responsible for thearrangements for paying public funds to the B.B.C. : the Broadcasting Vote hasbeen accounted for by his Ministry. The effect has been, broadly, that thePostmaster-General has been the &quot;technical&quot; authority and the Minister ofInformation the &apos;&apos; policy&apos;&apos; authority.19.   It is common ground : (i) that responsibility on technical matters should continue to rest withthe Postmaster-General;(ii) that, in so far as the Government may accept responsibility for the policybehind overseas broadcasting services, the responsibility should lie with the overseas Ministers, each in his own sphere (with co-ordinationas necessary through the Overseas Information Services Committees),
as is to be the case with Government-sponsored publicity to overseas countries through other media. It follows that parliamentary questions on the policy and effectiveness of overseas broadcasting willbe answered by the overseas Minister concerned.20. As regards responsibility of a more general kind, which would includeParliamentary responsibility for the Broadcasting Vote,* the choice lies between (A) a non-departmental Minister; in this case there would clearly be very strong reasons for choosing the Minister who is Chairman of the twoMinisterial Committees on Information Services, and(B) the Postmaster-General.The paragraphs which follow do not take account of the third possibility thata non-departmental Minister other than the Chairman of the Ministerial Com-mittees might be chosen, since it appeared to the Committee unlikely that thiswould commend itself to Ministers.21. The next year or two will be exceptional in that the renewal of the charter will throw up an abnormal number of questions requiring policy decisionsat Cabinet and high Ministerial level, and &quot;will also arouse abnormally keeninterest in Parliament. It must be recognised that, whoever bears the formalresponsibility to Parliament and whatever official organisation is used for thatpurpose, these questions of high policy will have to be handled by a Minister ofthe highest rank presumably the non-departmental Chairman of the ministerial committees who would either settle them, bring them before the appropriateCommittee, or refer them to the Cabinet, and would be the chief government spokesman in Parliament; for such matters he can look mainly to his personalstaff for assistance. And, apart fi&apos;om the exceptional conditions of the nearfuture, there will continue to be a certain number of highly political questions for instance, in relation to Ministerial broadcasts to which the same applies.Those who favour alternative (B) do not contemplate that B.B.C. matters of&quot;Cabinet&quot; or &quot;Cabinet Committee&quot; importance would be handled by thePostmaster-General to the exclusion of the non-departmental Chairman of thetwo Information Services Committees.22. High policy matters, therefore, as well as purely technical matters, are outside the argument, which is concerned with the formal responsibility to Parlia-ment for the Broadcasting Vote and, in general terms, that work in relation to theB.B.C. which requires an official staff beyond the normal scope of a Minister&quot;?personal office. This work comprises accounting and estimating work, and current administrative work in relation to monitoring, overseas broadcasts, tele-vision, &amp;c. (including the secretarial work for the Television Advisory Committee).Here too the next year or two may cause more work than normal, in view ofthe prospective developments of peace-time services. The work is not solelyroutine : it touches technical problems on the one hand, and on the other handinvolves some questions of policy, though not comparable in importance to thosereferred to in paragraph 21 above. It would be substantially increased (on boththe accounting and the policy sides) if it were decided to institute a closer controlover the B.B.C.&apos;s expenditure.!Alternative (A).23.   In discussion the representatives both of the Post Office and of theLord Presidents Office have expressed their general preference for this alternative,though there are difficulties about its precise operation.   It may be urged in its,favour : (i) That responsibility on other than technical questions ranges far wider than normal Post Office duties and would be an unwarrantable strain on the Postmaster-General and his senior officials. In this connection it will be recalled that the discussions of the Cabinet on politicalbroadcasting (CM. (45) 64th Conclusions) have assigned to &quot; thedepartment charged by the Prime Minister with responsibility forsuch matters&quot; the delicate task of dealing with the B.B.C. on ministerial and other political broadcasts.* It has been agreed that there should be a single Vote for all money to be voted for B.B.O.purposes, viz., for home broadcasting, overseas broadcasting and television.f The Committee were instructed to consider this possibility. They have not finished their examination of the problem and will shortly report separately on it.
(ii) That, in view of policy developments, and in particular of the renewal of the B.B.C. Charter, it is preferable that responsibility in Parlia-ment should be borne by a Cabinet Minister of high rank.24. The first difficulty about this alternative is the position vis-a-vis Parlia-ment. As mentioned above, it would of course be perfectly natural for the non-departmental Minister, like any other senior Minister, to speak on behalf of theCabinet in any debate on such important matters as the B.B.C. Charter. Hewould be appearing merely as the Cabinefs spokesman and not, ostensibly, in his capacity as chairman of Cabinet committees. But if he were given a specificand continuing responsibility through Parliamentary Questions, Estimates, &amp;c.it would be bound to emerge that it had been given to him because of his position on Cabinet committees. And whenever the chairmanship passed to the holder ofa different Ministerial office the change would have to be communicated toParliament.25/ The second difficulty relates to the staff through whom the non-departmental Minister would work in addition to his own personal staff.(i) It would clearly be out of the question to add all the necessary staff tothe strength of a non-departmental Ministers personal Office, andinappropriate that his senior official assistant should be appointedAccounting Officer for the Broadcasting Vote, with the consequentduty of appearing before the P.A.C.(ii) It would be possible to assign all the day-to-day and detailed work tothe Post Office, acting as the non-departmental Ministers agent andreferring major matters to him through his Private Office : if, however,the Post Office appeared on Estimates as the Department responsiblefor the Vote there would be some awkwardness in their Minister notbeing answerable to Parliament for their actions.(iii) If the work were entrusted to the G.I.O., with a suitably enlarged staff,as the non-departmental Ministers agent, the Head of that office would be the Accounting Officer. It could be objected that this andthe other work involved would represent an undesirable distractionfrom his main duties. And, since Treasury Ministers are to beresponsible to Parliament for the G.I.O., the awkwardness above referred to in the case of the Post Office would still arise. There is thefurther point that, in so far as the G.I.O. would be involved in policymatters (admittedly not of major importance), it would be inconsistent with the expressed intention that the G.I.O. will be a non-policy organisation, and might be criticised as such in Parliament.If, therefore, alternative (A) is adopted a further choice is necessary betweenthe three courses cited in this paragraph.Alternative (B).26. In favour of placing the overt Ministerial responsibility on the Post-master General it may be said :  (i) That he must be responsible on technical matters in any case, andtherefore he and his staff are necessarily involved to some appreciable extent in B.B.C. affairs. It should here be mentioned that it is extremely difficult to separate technical matters altogether from policy.The experience of the Ministry of Information is that discussionsinitiated with them by the B.B.C. at the official level on less importantpolicy matters have very frequently involved technical matters and aclearance has only been possible by way of three-cornered discussions between the B.B.C., the Ministry of Information, and the Post Office,(ii) That this solution avoids the difficulties referred to in paragraph 25above since the Post Office could take over the detailed workmore easily than any other Department, and, granted that the Post-master General bore the general responsibility, it would be perfectlynatural for the Post Office to account for the Broadcasting Vote (as before the war), with the Director-General as Accounting Officer.27. Those who favour this alternative would argue that it is not inconsistent with a system whereby the non-departmental Chairman of the ministerial committees exercised a major influence in the higher counsels of Government.
There is no reason why the Postmaster General should not act as the mouth-piece of the Cabinet vis-a-vis the B.B.C. or Parliament in matters involvingdecisions beyond his departmental competence; and no reason why. in mattersof sufficient importance, the non-departmental Minister should not join withhim in argument or debate on behalf of the Government.28. Against this alternative may be cited the arguments adduced inparagraph 23 above in favour of the other plan. To these it may be added thatif on major matters the decision must in practice be taken by the non-depart-mental Minister, or if necessary referred by him to the Cabinet, the PostmasterGeneral merely represents an unnecessary tier in the hierarchy.Conclusion.29. The Committee regret that they have been unable to devise a solution which avoids all the difficulties, and that they must, therefore, submit the matter to Ministers as a choice between the two alternatives in paragraph 20 above.The Future of the British Council.Introduction.30. An investigation into the Council&apos;s organisation was carried out some12 months ago by Sir Findlater Stewart, who made a report to the then Chan-cellor of the Exchequer and Foreign Secretary. The Foreign Office did not agreewith his recommendations and the present Official Committee have not been ableto reach a unanimous vieAv.31. It is common ground that considerable changes are necessary, designedin particular : (1) to obtain better control of the Council&apos;s organisation and work;(2) to effect economy;(3) to secure proper co-ordination between the work hitherto done by theMinistry of Information and the British Council.Plan A.32.   The minimum steps necessary are as follows :  (1) A closer scrutiny should be imposed by the Government on the Council&apos;sprojected activities and the Council should be required to show tothe satisfaction of the Foreign Office that its staffing administration(including recruitment and conditions of service) was on sound lines. Tothis end the Council&apos;s Controller of Establishments should be appointed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s approval. In addition some changesin the constitution of the Council itself may be desirable.(2) The Council should no longer be its own production or procurementauthority, but should be required to indent on the G.I.O. and h.M. Stationery Office in the same way as a Government Department.The Council&apos;s activities in this field have often been extravagant, and sometimes in competition with those of the Government; and theabolition of its production division should effect considerable economy.(3) The Council &apos;s sphere of work should be cut back to what is normallyunderstood by &apos;&apos; educational and cultural &quot; : it should not be allowedto overlap with the &apos;&apos; information &apos;&apos; services of the Government as,under an unduly liberal interpretation of the Charter, it has oftendone hitherto. (There is a problem of definition here; but the task of the British Council may be broadly defined as long-term education in the English language, British arts and sciences and British insti-tutions.)   This change, too, would result in considerable economy.33.   Reforms on these lines could probably be secured by agreement with theCouncil even if some amendments of the Charter were involved.34.   The arguments for this plan are : (a) it would involve the least changes and therefore less controversy;(b) at the same time there would be considerable economies;(c) the facade of a body independent of Government and the goodwill created by the British Council would be maintained (some observers, thoughby no means all, consider this an advantage from the point of view of avoiding the taint of propaganda),[31291] c
The arguments against are :  (a) It is doubtful whether short of a complete purge of existing Councilpersonnel effective reforms could be carried out;(b) Ministers would have to defend expenditure of public money by a bodyover whose spending they had not got complete control.This last point requires some amplification. The Council is in form anindependent body in receipt of a Government Grant-in-Aid and in theory itmight be claimed that Ministers are not responsible for the detailed control ofthe spending of the Grant; but it would be difficult to maintain such a theory inthe case of the British Council. Its Grant-in-Aid is its sole income and thePublic Accounts Committee and the Treasury have insisted that the ForeignOffice should exercise as much control as is possible over its spending. For thispurpose the Council have been required to draw up detailed estimates to beappended to the Grant-in-Aid, so as to make their financial procedure approxi-mate as far as possible to that of a Government Department. Granted the abovedevelopments in procedure, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Ministerscannot disclaim responsibility for the finance of this organisation even if itcontinues to be independent.Plan B.35. The most radical course would be to abolish the British Councilaltogether, its work being undertaken by the Overseas Departments, with theassistance of the G.I.O. and His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office. It would be expedient that the staff employed on &quot; educational and cultural &quot; work (restrictedas in Plan A) in connection with foreign countries should be segregated, in the sense that they would not become absorbed in the Foreign Service and inter-changeable with staff employed on other duties; in that event, they would, likethe corresponding staff employed by the other Overseas Departments and theG.I.O., be subject to ordinary Civil Service conditions of service. Alternatively,all the Services and staff concerned (except those employed by the G.I.O.) couldbe administered by the Foreign Office &amp;S 9. common S6rvic6 &amp; vailable for the other overseas Departments at need; here, again, they would be segregated from theForeign Service and be subject to ordinary Civil Service conditions ofemployment.36. This plan clearly would not be appropriate, if the view is accepted that&quot; educational and cultural &quot; work both day-to-day activities and such long-termprojects as the endowment of professorships at foreign universities is moreproperly, or more acceptably, performed by a separate body than by the Govern-ment direct.37. The disadvantages of the plan, apart from the possible loss of goodwill,are (i) that the revocation of the Council&apos;s Charter (which would, of course,be opposed by the Council) might require legislation and lead to poli-tical controversy;(ii) that an extra burden would be placed on the administrative machineryof the Overseas Departments (particularly the Foreign Office).38. The advantages, on the other hand, are that the greatest possible measure of economy would be achieved together with full co-ordination with government information services, and that the Foreign Secretary would not be obliged to defend in Parliament a Vote expended by an organisation beyond hisfull control.39. If this plan were adopted, it could not be brought into effective operation for a considerable time. During the interim period matters would not of course be left as they are; reforms on the lines of Plan A might well be introduced atonce as an interim measure.Plan C.40. There is a possible compromise plan, under which the Council would be abolished, but its work (restricted as in Plan A) would be taken over, not by the overseas Departments direct, but by a new Government Department under a Civil
1120Service controller directly responsible to the Foreign Secretary; recruitment, con-ditions of service. &amp;c, would, as in Flan B, be on Civil Service lines; the foreign secretary would be responsible in Parliament and the Departments services would be available to the other Overseas Departments.41. This plan would partake of the disadvantages of Plan B without its full advantages, and no members of the Committee feel disposed to recommend itas a satisfactory alternative.Conclusion.42. Ministers are therefore asked to decide between Plan A and Plan B. Itwill be seen that the decision turns mainly on the answer to two questions :  (1) Provided that the scope of the work is suitably restricted (as, by commonconsent, it is not now), is purely &quot;educational and cultural&quot; workappropriately entrusted, as a matter of principle, to a separatespecialist agency, or is such work proper to the Government itself ?(It is to be borne in mind that the whole of the Council&apos;s income isnow provided by the taxpayer.)(2) As a matter of practical administration, is it possible to achieve the requisite degree of efficiency and economy on &quot;educational and cultural &quot; work, if it is not performed direct by the Government?The G.I.O.-Ministerial Responsibility, Establishment, Accommodation and finance.43. The G.I.O. will have a separate Vote, for which the head of the office will be Accounting Officer. The Estimate will be defended in Parliament by treasury Ministers, who will also answer any questions regarding the staffing,efficiency and methods of the Office (as distinct from the publicity policy whichthe Office is subserving, which will be for the initiating Minister in each case).The Office will have its own financial and establishment staff, who will deal direct with the Treasury in the ordinary way. In these respects the position will beanalogous to that of the Stationery Office.44. But, while Treasury Ministers will bear the responsibility in Parlia-ment, all Ministers who make use of the Office will be interested in promoting its efficiency, and this interest will be specially foenssed in the non-departmental minister who is Chairman of the two Ministerial Committees. Accordingly,though close day-to-day Ministerial control is not contemplated, this minister will exercise general surveillance over the Office and will speak for the Office inany inter-Ministerial discussions (including any necessary discussions with treasury Ministers on financial matters).45. The Office will be staffed in the first instance mainly from existingMinistry of Information staff. Detailed establishments will have to be worked out with the Treasury without delay, and also the best methods of future recruit-ment. It is important that there should always be free interchange of staffbetween the G.I.O., the Information Branches of Departments at home and the publicity staff maintained abroad by the Overseas Departments.46. The decision to maintain a central information agency as part of thestanding machinery of Government raises the question of a permanent home for the G.I.O. Undoubtedly the smooth working of the Office would be endangeredif it were not sited somewhere really convenient to &quot;Whitehall.47. Provision will be made in the 1946 Estimates for the Overseas Depart-ments for the staff and operations abroad which they will be taking over from theMinistry of Information with effect from the 1st A&quot;pril, 1946. An Estimate willalso be presented this month for the G.I.O. itself. Work undertaken by the G.I.O.on behalf of Departments will be treated for Estimate purposes as an allied service.48. The emphasis, as regards both Departmental Information staffs and theG.I.O., should be on quality rather than quantity, and there will have to be asubstantial reduction in the overall expenditure on staff and production alike ascompared with war-time. The question whether in peace conditions the revenue from sales of publications, charges for films, &amp;c, could be increased should be[31291] n
examined. It should not be the object of the G.I.O. to enter into competition with commercial agencies but, if its work is of sufficient quality, there might bea considerable offset against expenditure from the revenue from sales, &amp;c.49. The total expenditure on information services formerly run by theMinistry of Information provided for in the draft 1946 Estimates (i.e., excludingexpenditure borne on the votes of His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, the Ministryof Food, Post Office and other home Departments) may be summarised asfollows : ^Gross. Net.GIO             ......... 4,039,300 2,631,300Foreign Office......... 2,933,000 2,767,000Colonial Office......... 149,950 149,950Dominions Office        ...... 31,800 31,800India Office    ......... 18,450 18,450 7,172,500  5,598,500The reduction in net expenditure as compared with the Ministry of InformationEstimates for 1945^46 is  969,092, and about  1^ million as compared withMinistry of Information expenditure in the two previous years. This reduction is disappointingly small, but a number of activities, which will shortly disappear,must continue to be provided for in the coming year, in addition to certain newpublicity services in and for liberated territories in Europe. In general, it isnot to be expected that the full economy which is rendered possible by the institu-tion of the G.I.O., coupled with the cessation of war-time conditions, can beachieved in the immediate future. The Estimates for 1947-48, both for theG.I.O. and for the Foreign Office, should show substantial reductions.Summary of Functions of the Government Information Office.50. The G.I.O. will be a separate Department with a Vote of its own. Itwill not be under close day-to-day Ministerial direction. It will, however, bethe responsibility of the non-departmental Chairman of the Ministerial Com-mittees to ensure that the G.I.O. is efficiently managed. The functions of theOffice may be summarised as follows : -(1) To act (within the terms of the more detailed statement in Annex I) asthe central Government agency for the preparation of publicitymaterial requested by Departments, including advertisements, films,photographs, and exhibitions, except where Departments can showthat they can more conveniently and economically produce such material internally, and for the provision of a common editorial service to prepare for publication through H.M. Stationery Office books andpamphlets required for general publicity purposes. The G.I.O. willbe responsible for the technical execution of Departmental require-ments, and on questions of presentation should be regarded as the expert. In practice Departments must have the final right to rejectmaterial provided by the G.I.O. to which they raise substantialobjection.(2) To maintain liaison with all Departments on their publicity requirements and the requirements of the countries or the sections of the publicwith which they are concerned.(3) To provide Departments with technical advice and assistance on publicitymatters.(4) To keep in touch with developments in publicity technique and todisseminate information on such developments to DepartmentalInformation Divisions.(5) To provide, at the request of the Overseas Departments, the above services to the Overseas Departments&apos; posts abroad, to distribute to those postsmaterial prepared or commissioned by it, except where bulk suppliescan be forwarded by H.M.S.O., and to supply the major overseas postswith the technical staff which they need, particularly on the productionside. On technical matters the G.I.O. will be free to communicatedirect with overseas posts, supplying the Departments concerned withcopies of the correspondence if required.(6) To undertake publicity as required on home matters which are of inter-Departmental scope or not assigned to particular Departments.   (It
will be open to the Public Relations Adviser to the Prime Ministerand the G.I.O. to initiate any necessary publicity outside the responsi-bility of particular Departments.)(7) To maintain a general and regionalised daily service of backgroundinformation and comment by cable or wireless for the use of overseas posts, subject to the head of this service being appointed in agreementwith the Foreign Secretary, and to the diplomatic and economiceditorial chairs being occupied by officers appointed in consultationwith the Foreign Office and Board of Trade respectively.(8) To provide the machinery for the central issue of Government news.(Contacts with the press or radio affecting day-to-day policy andinvolving background guidance to newspaper correspondents at home or abroad will, subject to sub-paragraph (7), rest with the individual departments and, in matters affecting Government policy as a whole,with the Public Relations Adviser to the Prime Minister.)(9) To provide secretarial assistance as required to the Ministerial and official Committees on Home and Overseas Information Services.(10) To establish and maintain a Regional organisation to the extent thatthis is necessary and to carry out regionally information services forDepartments which can dispense with a regional information serviceof their own.(11) To give advice and assistance as appropriate to autonomous or semi-autonomous Governmental bodies.(12) Broadcasting (under submission to Ministers in paragraphs 17-29 above).(13) British Council (under submission to Ministers in paragraphs 30-42above).(14) To perform any other functions which from time to time may be assigned to the Office.ANNEX 1.Production and Editorial Functions of the G.I.o. in relation to Depart-ments  generally  and  HlS  majesty&apos;S  stationery  office.(In amplification of the summary of functions (paragraph 50 (i).)To act as the central Government agency on behalf of the department concerned : (a) For the production and supply of official films (not including micro-films)and film strips other than those required for Service training and welfarepurposes; for the distribution of such material at home by exhibition in thecinemas, or non-theatrically to the general public and also to selected audiences(except where Departments can more conveniently and economically make theirown arrangements internally, e.g., for the showing of films and film strips in schools or to Service audiences); and for advising technically on the overseasproduction and distribution of films, film material and film strips required for publicity purposes.To avoid duplication of effort, e.g., in production, provision should be madefor full co-ordination between the G.I.O. and the other Departments concerned.(b) For the commissioning, management and presentation of all displayedpress advertising and poster advertising on commercial sites required by theGovernment at home.*(c) For arranging the design and production of all Government posters fornon-commercial sites other than those which can be produced direct by the stationery Office from materials supplied by Departments from their own resources.*(d) For designing, producing, and managing all Government exhibitionsother than trade exhibitions and art exhibitions; and for the design and* The National Savings Committees will continue to place their advertising direct and to beresponsible for presentation, but the G.LO. will act as the central agency for the allocation of press space for all Government advertising, including that of the National Savings Committees.Priorities will be settled where necessary by the Home Information Services Official Committee.[31291] &quot; d 2
production of such parts of the United Kingdom section of official InternationalExhibitions as are allotted to displays by United Kingdom Government Depart-ments. (The Board of Trade will remain responsible for trade exhibitions,including the British Industries Fair, and for the overall organisation and administration of the United Kingdom section of International Exhibitions andfor the allocation of space.)(e) For providing a common editorial service for books and pamphletsrequired for general publicity purposes, except in so far as Departments willcontinue to publish directly through His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office all departmental publications for which they or His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office canundertake full editorial responsibility.(/) For providing a common translation service for material required for publicity purposes.(g) For the preparation of all books, pamphlets and periodicals in english and foreign languages officially produced in this country for overseas publicity use;and for supplying material for inclusion in such publications produced overseas.(h) For advising technically on the overseas distribution and production ofall material under (g); and for stimulating the overseas distribution for officialpublicity purposes of suitable commercial books, newspapers and periodicals; and arranging, if required, for the supply of these items through His Maje*sty&apos;stationery Office.(i) For commissioning or preparing feature articles for overseas distribution.(j) For maintaining a central reference service which will prepare, obtainand supply reference material for publicity purposes at home and overseas, whenrequested.(k)* For supplying or producing all general publicity photographs foruse overseas, for maintaining a common service for taking and issuing publicityphotographs at home, and a central library of such photographs. (departments will be free to arrange to meet their own photographic requirements and to issuephotographs where this can be done conveniently and economically from their own resources.)Note. In relation to His Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office the G.I.O. willcentralise certain departmental functions on which the Stationery Office would otherwise deal with other Departments individually, but this will not affect theexisting centralisation in the Stationery Office of all official printing, publishingand purchasing of books, film strips and other material and also Crown copyrightadministration, which includes films, film strips and photographs as well as othermatter.ANNEX 2.Liquidation of the Ministry of Information and Disposal of its Functions.The Ministry of Information is organised into three Controllerships : &apos;.(i) Overseas Publicity comprising : (a) Five territorial Divisions dealing with publicity in foreign countries the American, European, Latin American, Middle East and Soviet.Relations Divisions.(b) The Empire Division.(c) The Empire Information Service, which is responsible  for givinginformation about the whole Empire to this country.(d) The Overseas Planning Section, which is responsible for drafting allMinistry plans for overseas publicity.(e) Overseas General Division, which provides an omni-directional morseservice intended for reception by information officers and PressAttaches overseas.(/) Reference Division.(g) Communications and Broadcasting Division.* Subject to any arrangement that may result from a review, now in hand, of centralphotographic and reproduction facilities (not confined to the publicity field).
Under the new organisation most of the functions of (a) and some of thefunctions of (b) and (d) will be discharged Departmentally, but the G.I.O. will need a planning and co-ordinating Division of its own, with which there mightbe connected a very small staff of specialists able to maintain liaison with the overseas Departments, where necessary, on the requirements of different regions of the World *As regards (c) (Empire Information Service), while the responsibility forpolicy will be a matter for the Dominions, Colonial, India and Burma Offices, theactual execution of policy will be for the G.I.O.As for (e), the scheme proposed will leave the Overseas General Divisionsfunctions substantially as they are.The Reference Division is doing work of value to all Departments which is essentially of the kind which can best be done in the G.I.O. and should continue.The arrangements for communications and broadcasting depend on thedecision on the relationship which should exist between the Government andthe B.B.C.(ii) Production Controller ship.   This consists of :- (a) Campaigns Division, which supervises and co-ordinates publicity adver-advertising in the press and on the hoardings for all Departments. It is responsible for the production of advertisement material required forpress and posters. The Ministry of Food and the National SavingsCommittee, however, make their own arrangements.(b) Exhibitions Division, which controls the design and presentation ofGovernment exhibitions and display material at home and overseas.(c) Photographs Division is responsible for the issue of official war photo-graphs and supplies photographic material for use by the ministry and other Departments at home and overseas. It maintains the largestphotographic library in the country.(d) Publications Division prepares the primary editions of all books,pamphlets and magazines produced by the Ministry in this countryboth for home and overseas use. It is also responsible for theproduction for overseas use of newspaper and magazine featurearticles.(e) Overseas Production Division produces all miscellaneous printed materialother than publications (e.g., folders, maps and posters). It alsoproduces all translated editions of publications.(/) Production and Supply Division arranges the printing required by otherMinistry Divisions; provides studio facilities; deals with questionsof paper supplies; packs and ships Ministry material to overseas posts; and assists where necessary in the commercial distribution ofBritish newspapers and magazines abroad.All of these Divisions will have something to contribute to the G.I.O., butin each case, at any rate in the long run, there should be a. substantial reductionin the volume of work. It may be possible to telescope some of the Divisions.There might, for example, be only three Divisions, dealing with Visual publicity.Publications.Campaigns.(iii) The Press, Home and Films Controller ship.The Divisions dealing with American Forces Liaison and presumably thatdealing with Official Artists have no peacetime future. The Wartime social survey is a common service organisation outside the ordinary range of publicitywork; its future is being separately considered.  The remaining Divisions, Films,* It is fundamental that the Overseas Departments should assume responsibility for policy,which means that they will decide what themes are appropriate for the various territories andwill authorise the material provided by the G.I.O., and that staff employed overseas and opera-tional expenditure should be taken on their vote. This leaves for the Empire staff of the G.I.O.the functions of extracting from the production divisions the material required by the EmpireDepartments and of making available to those Departments the resources of the productiondivisions.
Home, News and Tours and Facilities, are continuing to serve the needs of publicity in this country, working through Regional Information Officesestablished in 12 provincial centres.(a) Films Division. The production and distribution of films is much the biggest Ministry activity on the home side. About half of the filmsexpenditure is to meet the requirements of other Government Depart-ments. The Films Division directs and co-ordinates the wholeproduction effort working partly through contractors in thedocumentary film industry and partly through the Governments own production units. Distribution of films is achieved to some extentthrough the co-ordination of commercial film exhibitors, but mainly by means of the non-theatrical distribution scheme organisedregionally under the Regional Information Offices.(b) Home Division supervises, guides and co-ordinates the work of the regional Information Officers and gives advice to the technicaldivisions working under the Controller of Production. It conductsits own particular line of publicity by providing speakers on request to local societies, clubs, educational institutions, &amp;c.(c) News Division is a central channel for the issue of Government Newsto the newspapers, news-agencies and broadcasting authorities. Inaddition it is a central enquiry point for all Government Depart-ments, and as such provides working accommodation and facilities for overseas journalists based in London.(d) Tours and Facilities is a small section for co-ordinating government hospitality towards those people who visit this country under officialauspices, and usually operates through the Regional information officers.The G.I.O. will certainly require a Films Division, though probably with adiminished output. The News Division&apos;s function of providing the central machinery for the issue of Government news should probably be continued. Theprovision of facilities for overseas journalists in London should be continued for-atleast as long as the existingpremises are available (i.e., probably until August 1946).The work of the Tours and Facilities Section, though small in scale, is important and should be transferred to the G.I.O. as it involves a number of departments and much of it can best be done through a regional organisation^ On the otherhand, the G.I.O. should not assume the duty of sponsoring overseas journalistsin this country, or there may be political difficulties and the accusation that thenew body is only the Ministry of Information under a different name. Theresponsibility should lie with the Overseas Departments concerned. Most of thework relates to Dominions journalists.The extent to which it will be necessary to have a Division corresponding tothe Home Division turns largely on what regional organisation is contemplated.The bulk of the regional work relates to film shows and talks and any attempt tobreak them down to separate Departmental activities would be wasteful andinefficient. Certain further retrenchments can be made, but regional activitiescould not be greatly reduced without rendering it impossible to fulfil reasonablerequests from Departments. Theoretically some telescoping of Regions could achieve staff reductions, but it is undesirable that a common service of the kind proposed for the G.I.O. should deviate from the standard regional scheme:furthermore what might be gained by way of staff reduction would be offset by loss in control and efficiency. With the dissolution of the Regional Office in NorthernIreland and the maintenance of 11 Regions in Great Britain a staff reductionof about 50 on the present staff of 400 would be feasible. The regional organisation should remain broadly on these lines until more experience of peace-time conditions has been gained and at least until the possible transfer of theBritish Council&apos;-s work has been examined. It is recommended that the ScottishDepartments -should take over responsibility for tours, talks, campaigns and perhaps non-theatrical film shows in Scotland.* The Official Committee on the Machinery of Government recommended that the work inconnection with tours and facilities should be handed over to the Government Hospitality Fund,,suitably enlajged in scope.   This has been considered but is not regarded as practicable.
