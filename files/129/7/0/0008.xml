The detailed applica-tion of the suggestions is a matter for discussion. But the broad conclusion isunmistakable, and demands urgent action.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1,8th February, 1946.ANNEX.POLITICAL AND MILITARY EXPENDITURE OVERSEAS.I. Introductory.1. From a study of the import programme for civilian purposes the mostimpressive fact which emerges is the high proportion of it which consists of products which are truly essential to our economy. Of the proposed total of 1,075 millions, no less than  1,030 millions is classified as essential and only 45 millions as supplementary easements. To devote a further  40 millions toeasements or take it off exports, would make a susceptible difference to the standardof life. In this context an amount of relaxation such as  20 millions or 30 millions is a significant figure and far from negligible.2. This makes it all the more striking that when we turn to political andmilitary expenditure overseas, we seem ready to spend vastly larger figures. Itwill be seen from what follows that we are in danger of spending in this wayan aggregate which is high in relation to our total expenditure on imports andenormous in relation to the economies which we can obtain by depriving the civilian of his small luxuries and conveniences. Looking a year or two aheadit should be within our capacity to develop a volume of exports, which, togetherwith our invisible income, will take care of our imports. On the other hand, thecurrent and prospective demands upon us for political and military expenditure overseas have already gone far beyond the figure which can, on any hypothesis,be sustained.3. The figures given below are indeed extremely shocking, and show that theposition is rapidly getting out of hand. Ministers should not remain unwarnedthat they are going down the drain at a great pace, unless they can considerbefore it is too late whether a drastic and early change of policy may not be preferable. It is not yet too late, since, as will be shown below, many of thedemands are not j&apos;et commitments.4. It will be shown that the gross political commitments abroad already accepted and the similar demands already in sight, together with the prospectivemilitary expenditure overseas on the present basis, may considerably exceed thewhole of the projected American credit which is expected to cover us for the six years 1946-51 (namely,  937 millions).[31287]
5. It would considerably upset the hard-pressed British public if they wereto become aware that (reckoning our overseas statistics globally) not a single beanof sustenance for themselves or of capital equipment for British manufacturersis likely to be left over from the American credit; and that we shall require,on balance, the whole of it, and, unless we change our ways, much more, to feedand sustain Allies, liberated territories and ex-enemies, to maintain our militaryprestige overseas, and, generally speaking, to cut a dash in the world considerablyabove our means.6. In short, current developments abroad need to be reconsidered withoutdelay; especially those which are being undertaken before the American creditis actually in the bag.7. Our resources are strictly limited. Any one use of them is, therefore,alternative and not additional to some other use. We have reached the point when no commitment should be undertaken without our at the same time deciding what to forgo. If the maintenance of a Polish army involves the same burden on our overseas finances as the Ministry of Food&apos;s annual programme ofadditional desired easements, Ministers, if they prefer the former, should do soconsciously and deliberately. This example is taken at random and may not bea good one. But it is a principle which applies to all the objects of overseas expenditure which are to be reviewed in what follows. Another example is thesuggestion that the reduction in our forces overseas should be postponed until after the Peace Conference. The good reasons for this are obvious. But the cost should be worked out in terms of the cost of the bacon ration. If the ForeignOffice argument prevails, then the bacon ration should be appropriately cut. Wecannot have both without running into a hopeless position later on. Each item ofexpenditure, before it is accepted, should be regarded as a choice which isdeliberately preferred to a clearly envisaged alternative. This is obvious; but itis seldom acted upon.II. -Political Expenditure Overseas.8. It is not easy to estimate either the net ultimate burdens on the exchangesor the precise date at which they are likely to fall due. The clearest way of presenting the picture will be to start off with the full figure of the grosscommitments and of the demands which are in sight. This will lead to acumulative result which is certainly too high. How much too high it is difficultto say. But the grounds for qualification and abatement can also be mentioned.And, in the light of these, a general impression can be formed of what weare in for.9. In the following table, the &apos;&apos; firm &apos;&apos; commitments relate to those whichwe have already undertaken in principle, but the actual cost is not in all casesdefinite : Relief-&apos;U.N.R.R.A.........Post-U.N.R.R.A.     (includingItaly and Austria)Germany (imports) ...European Allies France   ...Holland and N.E.I......Greece   ...Poland (excluding Army)Czechoslovakia........Russia   ...Far East Hongkong-Borneo  ...ChinaBurma   ...Malaya ...Other-Turkey ...SudanColonies ...1946.Firm.13588246r*O8109220?5211946.       1947-8.Contin-      Contin-gent. gent.(  millions.)25?150?50605?403020?5?2315?8?121Total1946-8.13525?238909044113104535515230Total315115750
10. There are certain offsets against the above. The most important is our share of Germany&apos;s exports. This is provisionally estimated at about half thecost of her necessary imports. But much of her exports are to her continentalneighbours, some or several of which are doubtful payers. The same difficultyapplies to certain paper claims for Civil Affairs Supplies which we shall be pre-senting  35 million to France and  15 million to Holland, for which they arecertain to ask for credit arrangements. On the other hand, a similar claim of 15 million against Belgium can be reckoned good and can be used towards theestimated  20 million of Belgian expenditure by the British Army of the Rhine.11. The Polish army is costing us  2  million a month (excluding mark andlira expenditure) which is additional to Uhe above.   At present they are situated 70,000 ............ United Kingdom.45,000 ...      ......... Germany.90,000 ............. Italy.15,000 .........      ... Middle East.Much of the cost enters into our balance of payments indirectly or is included inthe estimate of military expenditure given below. Nevertheless these forces con-tinue to cost us  2^ million a month in meal or malt. Since no one has any ideawhere they will all be in six months&apos; time, they are of little use to us as a meansof saving our own man-power.12. The post-U.N.R.R.A. relief and rehabilitation needs of Italy, Austria,Greece and perhaps Poland during 1947 have been provisionally estimated in theForeign Office at  187+ million, which we hope is too high but may not prove so.We are, of course, entirely uncommitted as yet to post-U.N.R.R.A. relief expendi-ture, and we certainly ought to decline further responsibility. Otherwise, our share can scarcely be less than the token figure of  25 million which has been entered in the above table.13. The figures for France have been entered after deduction of the pro-portion which we shall expect them to pay for in gold. We are expecting (we hope not too optimistically) that the balance will be provided out of privately owned French assets in United Kingdom. Except in so far as we receive securitieswhich are marketable abroad (e.g., in South Africa), the fact that our long-term capital position is maintained does not, however, help our balance of paymentsduring the relevant period. Much the same applies to the credits for which theDutch will be asking.14. Siam. Nothing has been included in the above for Siam. The issuehere is whether or not we pay Siam for rice. If we do pay them, it will cost us 3 - 6 million in 1946 and the possible amounts involved over a period may be ofthe order of  20 million. The effect of the recent decision of the Cabinet inrelation to the proposals^of the Ministry is not clear, but might be expensive.15. Burma. Required financial assistance from United Kingdom to theend of the first year of civil government was estimated, before V.J .-Day, asfollows : !Equipment to Expenditurebe ordered. in Burma.  millions.   millions.(a) Key industries        ...      ...      11-8 12-1(6) Public utilities       ......        8-1 2-5(e) Supplies for civil consumption      19-5 4-5(d) Government services         ...        3-9 7-5*(e) Pre-evacuation liabilities   ...        ... 8-043-3 34-6* Budget deficit.The expenditure under (a) and (c) and expenditure of 2-6 under (b) will ultimately be recovered from industrialists, purchasers, &amp;c. These recoveriestotal  32-8 millions on equipment and  17-7 millions on expenditure in Burma.But this will not relieve our balance of payments. In the following year, therequirements would be  7-5 millions (Budget deficit only) all in Burmese[31287] B 2
currency. Supplies are most unlikely to be needed in the near future to the full extent of this figure, and if they were, they would not be available in 1946.Probably the right figure to take is Burma&apos;s adverse trade balance (plus the increase in Burma&apos;s balances in India resulting, from our military expenditure on Indian troops). There is great difficulty in avoiding doublecounting, because the expenditure of our Armed Forces is already included in overseas military expenditure. But it seems rather unlikely that the amount involved in 1946 will exceed, say  20 millions, with smaller annual figures in1947^18.Nevertheless, unless we revise our present (in my opinion, preposterous)proposal to put up sterling cover against local Burmese expenditure coveredby an expansion in the note issue, the whole of the above is an ultimate liability,especially when Burma receives a large measure of self-government.16. Malaya. The Malayan position is very complex. Last April, the malayan Planning Unit estimated the Government expenditure required in thefirst two years as :   millions.Public utilities   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ..-      17-9Belief supplies..................      22&apos;8Rehabilitation of industry      ............        2-743-4They estimated the net expenditure at  42 millions in this period (outstandingcommitments, e.g., to civil servants  18 millions, general Administration 6 millions, public utilities  17-9 millions, rehabilitation of industry 0-2 millions). Against this, they had free sterling balances of  32 millions(excluding currency fund, &amp;o), so that they reckoned upon a deficit of only 10 millions in the Government^ accounts. On the same basis, damage havingbeen much less than expected, they would probably, in fact, need no subsidy atall.&apos; However, there is a project to spend about  8f millions on tin rehabilitation,which was not included above, some of which would be spent in Malaya.Malaya may have a small adverse trade balance in 1946 financed by drawingdown her sterling balances but it cannot be very large. Sales of tin and rubbershould be not far short of  25. millions, and imports are severely restricted bysupply considerations. In 1947 and 1948 Malaya should have an export surplus,but the above means that we shall not obtain the normal advantage from this in1946.17. To sum up the political expenditure, the prospective net outgoings in1946-48, after allowing for offsets, appears to be of the order of  600 millions, ifwe continue more or less on the present lines. Much of this, however, is still avoid-able. But even the most drastic reversal of policy, on the lines suggested below,will hardly bring the total below  300- 400 millions, which is already far inexcess of what we took into account during the Washington discussions.III. Military Expenditure Overseas.18. Last autumn provisional figures were adopted, with no detailedestimating behind them, of  300 millions in 1946 and  100 millions in each of thenext two years. More recent calculations indicate that these figures were con-siderably too low on the basis of the forces outside Europe programmed beforethe recent decision of Ministers. For expenditure iu the fourth quarter of 1945was running well above  600 millions a year. The crucial figure for the Treasuryis the number &quot; outside Europe &quot; rather than the number &quot; overseas.&quot; The plan which was in force until recently provided for very small reductions outside europe compared with V.J.-Day. Will the revised plan result in a reduction below500,000 outside Europe by the end of 1946 (which, on the revised basis of a grandtotal of 1,200,000 in the forces, would be compatible with 300,000, in Europe and400,000 in and around the United Kingdom)? If not, this would give a year&apos;saverage of (say) 650,000 outside Europe in 1946 compared with 725,000 on theunrevised plans and 820,000 at V.J.-Day. This would suggest a total cost of anything from  300 to  400 millions in 1946, even assuming the proposed reduc-tions. Moreover, at the beginning of 1947 the annual rate of cost wTould still be running at well above  200 millions!
A figure of  300 millions could be built up like this :  m.125   (end-1945 about  300m., but estimated at less than 100 m. in financial year 1946-7)75   (end-1945 about  100m., but related to smaller forcethan present plan)30   (from North America, Australia, South Africa)20   (say, for all United Kingdom Forces overseas (excl.B.A.O.R.))50   (Burma, Malaya, East and West Africa, &amp;c, but certain credit items on the other side)300* Includes Indian troops in S.E.A.G., Greece or Middle East.This does not include equipment and other stores produced in, and shipped from,this country or the corresponding shipping costs.This, however, is not even the revised plan, which, unless still further revised,might cost anything from  600 millions to  750 millions in the three years1946-48.IV. Summary.19. Altogether, without a drastic change of policy, political and military expenditure in the three years 1946-48 might run us into up to  1,500 millionsgross; whilst the minimum net figure in sight on present lines plainly exceeds 1,000 million.20. We have, of course, no margin of overseas resources approaching )lj500 millions. Nor should we have, even if the figure was brought down to 1,000 millions. The utmost provision allowed for in the calculations we made during the Washington negotiations was  600 millions for the three years1946-48.21. What can be done about it? It is obvious that any proposals sufficientlydrastic must encroach on the political sphere. But it is not easy to see thatthere can be any solution which does not involve the following : (a) A virtual cessation of further political loans. We must try to face the fact that we cannot lend money we have not got. Both France and Holland,quite apart from their gold reserves (substantial in the case of France), heldrecently, and probably still hold in the main, the following dollar assets : $ balances. $ securities.($ million).France       .........      357 1,400Holland     .........      218 1,800Thus each of them, in addition to their gold, possesses nearly $2 billionsof dollar assets which is far in excess of what we, with far greater commitments,possess. Why should we, except out of unthinking and improvident good-nature,lend them anything at all ?We certainly do not want these countries to collapse, and it is difficult torefuse to let them use their sterling balances (though not their sterling securities,except where they are marketable abroad) though even this we cannot reallyafford. But this is about the limit. Perhaps a helpful line would be to see howfar the Dominions would be prepared to give credits to these countriesindependently; though this again might be at the expense of the Dominions&apos; ownsterling balances.(b) A reconsideration of our economic policy towards Germany. It seemsmonstrous that we should first de-industrialise and thus bankrupt the Ruhr toplease Russia and then hand over the territory, or at any rate the industries,to an international body to please France, but that we alone should remain responsible for feeding the place. This responsibility ought to be shared by thecountries which share in the international control of the Ruhr industries. Ourpresent policy towards Germany, by which we have become involved in payingher large reparations, might rank as the craziest ever if one did not rememberlast time.India*Middle East ...Food......Oil     ......Other (net)   ...
(c) A reduction in our military forces outside- Europe to 250,000 at the earliestpossible date.We simply cannot afford to make our plans on the basis of being half and half-heartedly ready for war with Russia. Yet, what else does a great deal ofour military expenditure mean ? We are spending twice too much for solvency,and twice (or four times) too little for safety in conditions of hostility and a war of nerves dispersed over two continents; thus making sure of the worst of bothworlds.Take the case of Egypt. How do we propose to reply to the Egyptian demand that we should take our troops out of Egypt? Is it appreciated that we arepaying the cost of keeping them there by borrowing it from Egypt ? What isthe answer if Egypt tells us (as, of course, she will) that she is no longer preparedto provide us with the necessary funds? Has this hard fact been faced andanswered ?From Greece we should take out our troops as soon as possible and reducethe Greek Army from 100,000 to 50,000. Neither we nor the Greeks can afford 15 millions a year to provide British equipment, including food, for an army which is, in any case, bound to be useless against Yugoslavia or Russia. WhenU.N.R.R.A. stops feeding Greece, the Greeks will have to use up their foreign exchange reserves to some extent and, for the rest, we should try to get the americans to do as much as we can.The Polish Army should be disbanded immediately.Holland should be asked to pay for Indonesia out of her dollar and othermarketable assets.(d) in the Far East Burma obviously needs looking at again on a realisticbasis, and we must try to see whether we can get some free rice from Siam in thefuture, though the Cabinet decided recently that, for the time being at any rate,we should not ask for free rice now.22. Some of our present activities will be futile unless they can be followed up and persevered in for an appreciable time. Nothing but waste and humilia-tion can result from not looking ahead and keeping within our long-run capacity.For there is not the faintest prospect, on any hypothesis, of our being able tocarry on our present practices.23. The above summary, being limited to political and military expenditure overseas, takes no account of such claims on our overseas resources as: (a) Subscriptions to the Bretton Woods Fund and Bank.(b) Withdrawals of existing sterling balances by liberated countries, &amp;c.,eg.-[Balances held at30th Sept., 1945.) m.Norway ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 75Greece   ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 57China    ......       ...      ...... 23Siam     ...      ...       ...      ...      ... 13(c) Any net cost of releasing Sterling Area Balances in the period 1946-51.We can expect to accumulate some further balances during the early part of 1946,and that is why the monetary position in respect of overseas finance is not acutein spite of the delay in the American credit. But we are likely to have to makeat least corresponding, and perhaps greater, releases in 1947-51. In this con-nection it should be emphasised that our political and military expenditure over-seas reduces correspondingly our ability to sustain the Sterling Area countries,both currently and later on. Thus the result of not curtailing this expendituremust be to make inevitable still harsher treatment of the Sterling Area balancesthan the severe treatment which will be unavoidable in any case.On the other hand, it does not take account of certain modest windfalls of a capital character which we may recover in respect of past transactions or through a further disposal of capital assets. These are not large enough, however (orcertain enough), to affect the argument.KEYNES.8th February, 1946.
