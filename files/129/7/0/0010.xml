The draft White Paper, the terms of which have the approval of theForeign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, explains the positionand proposes that His Majesty&apos;s Government should ratify the Instrument.3. In the past the ratification of International Labour Conventions has beenin the form of an Order in Council. It is proposed to ratify this Instrument andany future International Labour Instruments such as Conventions by an instrument signed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. This is in accord with general ratification practice and is more convenient than an Order inCouncil.  It is, of course, equally effective for the purpose.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W. 1,15th February, 1946.[31296]

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONFERENCEAt its 27th Session the International Labour Conference adopted on 5thNovember, 1945, an Instrument of Amendment to the Constitution of theInternational Labour Organisation. The text of the Instrument is set out as an Appendix to this paper.The Instrument of Amendment is designed to deal with three questions,affecting the Constitution of the Organisation which are of urgency in viewof the prospective winding up of the League of Nations.These questions relate to:(1) membership of the International Labour Organisation;(2) the arrangements for the financing of the Organisation; and(3) the procedure for making future amendments to the Constitution ofthe Organisation.(1) The amendments dealing with the membership of the organisation which are set out in Article III of the Appendix of this paper are self-explanatory and are aimed at achieving the full participation in the Organisa-tion of all states which are members of the United Nations. They replace the present text which connects membership of the I.L.O. with membership of the League of Nations.(2) The provisions concerning financial and budgetary arrangements dealtwith in Article III are designed to facilitate the conclusion of appropriatefinancial and budgetary arrangement between the International LabourOrganisation and the United Nations, and to make provision for the continu-ance of the work of the International Labour Organisation in any intervalwhich may occur between the winding up of the League of Nations and theconclusion of appropriate arrangements -with the United Nations.(3) Article IV of the Appendix provides for a new procedure for makingfuture amendments to the constitution of the International Labour Organisa-tion. In substitution of the existing arrangements under which such amend-ments require ratification by three quarters of the members of the Organisa-tion, including all the states whose representatives compose the Council ofthe League of Nations, it provides that amendments shall take effect whenratified or accepted by two thirds of the members of the Organisation,including five of the eight members which are represented on the governing body as states of chief industrial importance.The International Labour Conference at its 27th Session had a full dis-cussion as to further possible amendments to its constitution and these wereremitted for examination and report early in 1946. This report and wider questions affecting the constitution of the International Labour organisation will be considered at the next International Labour Organisation conference which will be held in the autumn of 1946.The present Instrument of Amendment to the Constitution of the Inter-national Labour Organisation does not pre-judge the question of any widerchanges in its Constitution but provides the immediate amendments whichare necessary for the continuance of the work of the International LabourOrganisation when the League of Nations has ceased to exists.His Majesty&apos;s Government propose to ratify the Instrument of Amendmentas set out in the Appendix to this Command Paper.
