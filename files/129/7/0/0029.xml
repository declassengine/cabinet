THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET.CP. (46) 79.22nd February, 1946.CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS THE JAPANESE SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Overseas Reconstruction Committee, at their meeting on the11th February, 1946, considered the policy which His Majesty&apos;s Governmentshould adopt towards Japanese industry. They reached agreement on the levelof the Japanese economy in the early post-war period and on the principles whichshould govern the framework of measures designed to limit the Japanese war potential. They also agreed on the measures of prohibition and restrictionwhich should be applied to specific Japanese industries in the interests of security.Their recommendations over this field are being submitted to the Cabinetseparately CP. (46) 78. They failed, however, to reach agreement on thequestion whether or not the Japanese should be permitted to build ships larger than the coastal type, and decided that the issue should be referred to the Cabinet.The arguments on either side are stated in the following paragraphs. A relevantfactor is that the Committee were agreed that the maximum annual consumptionof steel which should be allowed to Japan should be fixed at 3 - 5 million ingot tonsor 3-7 million tons if the construction of ocean-going ships is to be allowed.Arguments against Permission to build Ships larger than the Coastal Type.2. (a) If the building of Merchant Ships other than coastal craft is allowedat all, although it may be possible to bar warship building for a time, it will notbe possible to prevent the Japanese from collecting its two most importantelements, skilled men and professional experience.(b) A Merchant Ship-building Industry will automatically create a corps of skilled designers, draughtsmen, technicians and labour accustomed to the problemsof shipbuilding, most of which are common to warships and merchant ships, andit will keep alive the shipbuilding tradition which is half the battle towards achange-over to warship work when the time comes. It will also enable japan to keep abreast of current shipbuilding developments, which is particularlyundesirable at a time when research into hull form and propulsion is going-forward rapidly and revolutionary changes may be expected in the nextfew years.(c) The Industry necessitates precisely the plant it is desired to eradicate,viz., heavy forging plant and foundries equipped with heavy lifting gear. Solong as the Japanese are restricted to coastal craft of, say, 1,500 to 2,000 grosstons, and round about 300 feet in length, they would not require the plant requiredfor warships, since a warship comparable in size, e.g., a destroyer, requiresheavier forgings than such an industry could produce. But if they were permitted to advance into the 5,000-ton field, they would necessarily acquire plant whichWould equip them for cruiser building.(d) Even if we could keep indefinitely a constant guard over Japan so as toprevent her building warships, we should not have destroyed her powers as an aggressor. For an attack on the Asiatic coast, which is geographically hermost probable objective, ships are required which can (i) carry and discharge rocket projectiles;(ii) transport troops, weapons and vehicles.For these purposes a merchant ship is a warship.(e) If Japan needs ships to keep her economy going, she might be permitted to acquire a minimum tonnage by charter, or purchase, but she should not be13168   [31371]Copy No.
allowed to purchase, or charter, more than this minimum and her imports couldbe carefully watched,    .      - . .(/) Assuming that no limitation were placed on Japanese Merchant Ship-building, her surplus output would at once come into competition with our own industry, at least indirectly. If Japan is assumed to need about 2,500,000 tonsof shipping for her minimum carrying trade, excluding coastal trade, she couldpresumably build up that amount in about 5 years, and thereafter, freed fromthe task of building warships, her competitive output might be nearly. a rnilliontons a year. At that time our own Shipbuilding Industry will probably be hardput to it to find business amounting to 750,000 tons a year. An additionalcompetitor with an output of a million and almost certainly very low costs will therefore involve a risk of loss of almost all of our &quot; export &quot; market in ships.Once in production, it might be difficult to keep, the Japanese Merchant Ship-building Industry down to any given output. It would be possible for some time at least to bar subsidies, but the Japanese with their Zaibatsu experience mightwell succeed in evading such restrictions.(g) To impose this prohibition is not only the most economical way of stopping the creation of Japanese war potential, but of preserving our own.The resurgence of the German Mercantile Marine after the last war was a vitalfactor in building up Germany&apos;s power of aggression; but it was also a causeof the serious decline in our own shipbuilding industry a decline which very nearly lost us the war. It is unwise to assume in the light of the German examplethat Japan could not re-create her potential very quickly, and the proposed steelconsumption maximum of 3-5 or 3-7 million tons would not be an effective bar.Arguments in favour of Permission to build Ships larger than the Coastal Type.3. (a) As an island race, with strong seafaring instincts, the japanese would not readily reconcile themselves to the permanent loss of a mercantilemarine. To prevent them from building ocean-going ships would cause them toharbour, feelings of intense frustration. These might lead eventually to there-creation of an aggressive spirit, which might be fostered and exploited byPowers potentially hostile to world peace.(6) No modern Power could go to war without aircraft. Japan is to be denied the possession of any aircraft, or aircraft factories. This prohibitionwill be the vital factor in preventing future Japanese aggression, and makesunnecessary the prohibition of a mercantile marine.(c) It has been proposed that the Japanese annual steel consumption shouldbe limited to 3 - 5 or 3 - 7 million ingot tons for all purposes. This in itself will bea severe handicap to the reconstruction of a Japanese mercantile marine.(d) It is not considered that the prohibition of shipbuilding in Japan wouldin itself have much effect on the prosperity of our own shipbuilding industry,which will depend much more on the policies adopted by the shipbuildingcountries of the world as a whole. The total amount of shipping built in far eastern countries is unlikely to be affected by the denial of shipbuilding to Japan.If Japan does not build the ships, China might.(e) If Japan is denied a mercantile marine she will be driven to balance herpayments by a more intensive export drive. The result of this is likely to beprejudicial to United Kingdom exports. Even if Japan is given permission toacquire tonnage by chartering or purchase she would not be entirely relieved from the necessity for exporting greater quantities of other goods. Charteringwould mean that only part of the proceeds from her shipping services would beavailable to her, while purchase would probably be very difficult unless foreigncredits were granted to her.4.
