fcrllS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET &quot; )    \ ,, .CP. (L6) 6719TH FEBRUARY.   1 9L6 COPY NO.cabinet future OF THE &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; ANDTHE &quot;QUEEN MARY&apos;&apos;Memorandum by the Minister of War transport the &quot; QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; is at present engaged in there patriation of Canadian Service personnel from U.K.  to north America.    After completing her present voyage,  therewill not be sufficient Canadian troops coming forward tojustify her further use in this service.2. The alternative courses op6n to me are as follows:-(a) to release her forthwith from trooping service,so that she can be taken in hand immediatelyfor reconditioning for normal North Atlanticpassenger service;(b) to keep her in service and to find employment-,for her in other personnel movements, inspite of the difficulties and loss of operatingefficiency involved (as described below).3. I am strongly in favour of release,  but since there may well be a certain amount of criticism of this action, I feel it is incumbent upon me to inform mycolleagues of the circumstances of the case*L,. &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; can be employed economically and efficiently only in the North Atlantic.      After the end ofher present voyage the only Government service in which she could be employed on that route would be the repatriation of the wives and families of Canadian Service personnel.For the following reasons,  I do not advocate this use of the vessel:-(i) Before April she can only use New York as adisembarkation port in North America.      TheCanadian authorities have stated that theycannot accept their families in New York.Halifax is not a practicable port for thisship before April.(ii) Shipping has already been allocated for thomovement of Canadian families to the limit ofthe rate at which the Canadian administrativemachine can handle them.      This should enablethe entire programme to be completed by august, which date has already been accepted and announced by the Canadian authorities.

5. Sines the &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; cannot go through the suez Canal or approach any Indian ports she could only beused for a voyage to Ceylon (Trine crnalee) or Sydney, N.S.W.Such a voyage&apos;presents serious administrative difficulties(bunkering,  etc.) and reduces her efficiency materiallybecause the voyage is longer and the numbers carried have-to be considerably reduced.      There is no large outstandingmilitary requirement for Australia.      Transhipment atTrincomalee of troops from India would involve loss ofcarrying capacity in various ways, which would make heruse for this purpose quite uneconomic.6. Further arguments   in favour of release are asfollows:-(a) I regard it as an important item of our nationalshipping policy that our trans-Atlanticpassenger service should be restored at theearliest practicable moment (i) with a viewto earning dollars and (ii) as a counter toforeign competition.(b) The work of reconverting &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot;for passenger service will occupy at least six months.      The &quot;QUEEN MARY&apos;s&quot; reconversioncannot be started until the &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot;is finished, because of the limitations ofsuitable conversion facilities.        Thus,  ifthese two ships are to be in a position to operate a fast trans-Atlantic service by the spring of 19I4J,  it is essential to release the &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; now.7. The shipping plans already made are adequate tocover the present Service programme for the repatriation of troops from the East.    I am not aware of the extent of possible increases in this programme, but I do not feelthat they are likely to be so great as to be incapable ofbeing met by the trooping fleet which will remain on service.8. There are certain requirements for the movement ofsponsored civilian passengers from this country toAustralia, New Zealand and South Africa (mainly the wivesof repatriated Dominion troops) for whom it is necessaryto make shipping provision as soon as possible..     The&quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; could, admittedly be used for these purposes (though again only with considerable difficulty and with great waste of her carrying capacity), but I feelthat the arrangements which I am already making with other ships are sufficient to cover the really urgent cases.9. On balance,  I have reached the conclusion that thebest course,  in the widest national interest,    is to release &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; from trooping service at the endof her present voyage, and I have taken the necessary steps to  this end.    The fact is that, -since the back ofthe&quot;trooping movement across the North Atlantic has been broken, the &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; is a white elephant from atrooping point of view, but will become an invaluableasset for normal passenger carrying once she is convertedfor that purpose.A.B.Ministry of War Transport,, W. 1 .,19th February,

this document is the property of his britannic majestvs governmentPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 68.19th February, 1946.CABINET.RESULTS OF FINAL SESSION OF THE UNITED MARITIMEEXECUTIVE BOARD.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.IN paper CP. (46) 42 I explained the issues confronting us at the FinalSession of the United Maritime Executive Board. The Board completed its workthis week and I append (Annex) copy of the Recommendations made by the board to the contracting Governments in the United Maritime Authority as to theshipping arrangements after the 2nd March when that Authority comes to an end.2.   The Recommendations of the Board may be summarised as follows :  (i) To cover the heavy movement of cargoes for U.N.R.R.A. and forcertain liberated nations from the United States and Canada,shipping is to be contributed by nations able and electing to do so.The employment of the shipping for these purposes will be controlledthrough a Contributory Nations Committee in Washington,(ii) A Co-ordinating and Review Committee in London will make arrange-ments for shipping for U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s requirements from other areas.This Committee will also keep under review the tonnage situation inloading areas other than the United States and Canada. From our point of view, the primary object of this Committee is to give usan opportunity through the contacts with other maritime nationsthus established to correct any tendency to draw off an excessiveamount of European-owned tonnage from Eastern hemisphererequirements.(iii) In a separate Part of the Recommendations it is proposed that thereshould be a United Maritime Consultative Council through which governments will be able to exchange information on shippingquestions and which may consider any problems that may arise and make appropriate recommendations to Governments if necessary.This provision for continued consultation on shipping questions seemsto me an essential for the transitional period. The Council will haveno executive powers and its functions and procedure are only verygenerally sketched in the proposal. In particular, the relationship of this body to the United Nations Organisation will need to be defined. The Council will probably meet in May when theopportunity for proposing the necessary arrangements in this regardwill arise. Meanwhile my representatives have safeguarded theposition of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this point.(iv) All these arrangements are for a transitional period ending not later than the 31st October, 1946.(v) Provision is made for Governments not participating in the united maritime Authority to join in these arrangements. I expect thatsome other Governments may wish to subscribe to Part &apos;&apos; B &quot; at least.The procedure in this regard will be arranged through ForeignOffice.3. I draw my colleagues&apos; particular attention to Recommendation 6. Thiswas inserted at our strong insistence that there should be some assurance that united States tonnage will continue to be available in sufficient quantities to meet
