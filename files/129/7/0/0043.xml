THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1946.SECRET.        ^ Copy No.CP. (46) 93.5th March, 1946.CABINET.NORTH BORNEO.Memorandum by the Under-Secretary of State for the  Colonies.1. On the 31st May, 1944, the War Cabinet (W.M. (44) 70th Conclusions)authorised Colonel Stanley to open confidential discussions with the Court of directors of the British North Borneo (Chartered) Company with a view to thetransfer to His Majesty&apos;s Government of sovereign and administrative rights in North Borneo, on the understanding that no financial commitment was to be entered into without further authorisation.2. Colonel Stanley reported to the War Cabinet Committee on Malaya andBorneo in December 1944 that negotiations had reached the stage at which nofurther progress was possible unless he were authorised to enter &quot;into a financial commitment. The Committee invited him to have the matter taken up with theTreasury, with a view to working out principles on which an arbitration shouldbe based and to report to the Committee (C.M.B. (44) 2nd meeting).3. I need not trouble the Cabinet with details of all the proposals and counter-proposals which have since been made by His Majesty&apos;s Government andthe Company. Their outcome leaves a substantial difference between the two parties in regard to terms of arbitration. The Company consider that the terms should be on the widest possible basis so as to enable either side to put forwardany factors for consideration. The Government take the view that the arbitratormust be confined to a particular basis, namely, that of the net revenue that is likelyto be maintained in the future, compensation being assessed as a number of years&apos;purchase of such net revenue, and the appropriate number of years being determined by the arbitrator. The view of the Government is, of course, largelyinfluenced by the necessity to avoid in this case, where only a comparatively small amount of money is involved, terms which might prove embarrassing and expensivein proceedings for the nationalisation of the coal industry or for any otherindustry in the future.4. In view of this difference of opinion over arbitration terms, the Secretaryof State has tried, in agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to find a figure which, without recourse to arbitration, could be justified by the Governmentto Parliament and might be recommended by the Directors to shareholders. a tentative offer of  2,100,000 was made to the Directors of the Company, who,however, rejected it. They said that such a settlement would enable them, aftermeeting all other liabilities, to pay their shareholders at the rate of approxi-mately 135. per  1 share, whereas, in their view, that distribution should certainly be not less than 16s. per share. (The present market price of 18s. pershare undoubtedly reflects some expectation that the Company will securefavourable terms for the transfer of the sovereign and administrative rights ofthe territory to His Majesty&apos;s Government. For the 16 years preceding theJapanese occupation the average maximum price of the shares was 10s. 2d.)5. If the cash offer were to be increased by, say,  300,000 to make it one that the Directors would feel able to recommend to their shareholders, it would no doubt be criticised as being too generous, bearing in mind the average valueof the shares over a period of normal years.   On the other hand, such a cash[31414]
settlement, even-though it involves the risk of the shareholders receiving more generous treatment than under an arbitration, might be justified as saving thetime, labour and expense involved by arbitration proceedings which would undoubtedly be long and costly.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer does not, however, feel able to agreeto any increase in the offer already made, and I propose, therefore, to perseverewith the negotiations with the Company, in the hope of reaching agreement onarbitration terms. Fortunately, I think that the prospects are much brighter thanthey were when the matter was previously discussed with the Directors.7. It is, however, quite clear that there is no prospect of the terms of thenecessary agreements being settled as between the Government on the one handand the Directors of the Company on the other, and of their being executed afterthe acceptance of the shareholders has been secured, before the target date which has been fixed for the termination of military administration in north borneo. This date has already been postponed from the 1st March to the1st April and any further postponement might create difficulties for the militaryauthorities and could not be justified on purely military grounds.8. In these circumstances, there seems to be no alternative but to arrangefor the Company to resume administration of the territory, when the militaryauthorities are ready to hand over, at the end of this month, for such time asis required to conclude the negotiations for the transfer of sovereign andadministrative rights to His Majesty&apos;s Government. There have been enquiriesin Parliament on this subject, and I suggest that the Secretary of State should,after consultation with the Company, make a statement to the above effect as soonas possible in reply to an arranged question.9.   I accordingly seek the approval of the Cabinet for (a) the continuance of negotiations with the Company with a view to securing agreed arbitration terms, bearing in mind the important consideration, from the Governments point of view, set out inparagraph 3;(b) an early announcement in the House, after agreement with the Company,that the Company will resume the administration of the territory onthe termination of the military period, as a temporary measure andfor such time as is required for the conclusion of the negotiations forthe transfer of sovereign and administrative rights to His Majesty&apos;sGovernment.A. C. J.Colonial Office, 5th March, 1946.J
