-    123IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET.OgPi  (46)&apos;- 83S7TII FEBRUARY,  1946.cabinet future USE OF THE &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of War transport at their meeting on the 25th February the Cabinet invited me  (CM. (46) ISth Conclusions, Minute 8)  to obtain fullerinformation as to  the Cunard White Star Company&apos;s intentionsregarding the class of civilian traffic to be carried in the&quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot;, and the proportion of the total space tobe allocated to and the degree of luxury to be provided for first class passengers,2.      I have discussed the question with the Chairman of the cunard White Star Company and I have requested that inreconditioning the vessel,  the utmost economy in labour and materials should be observed without impairing the competitivevalue of the ship.3, I have been assured that the accommodation provided forall classes in the &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; will be on much plainerlines than in the &quot;QUEEN MARY&quot; as she was before the war.4.      There will be no very marked difference between the  cabinand tourist class  eccommodation,  and the same will apply to the better cabins in the third class accommodation as compared withthe tourist accommodation.    There will,  therefore, be a broadinterchangeability of accommodation in the three classesthroughout the ship.5.      As regards the    reconditioning of the ship,  the position isthat more than 90 per cent,   of the furniture and equipment forthe &quot;QUEEN ELIZABETH&quot; was completed at the  time that the shipleft this  country in February 1940.      This furniture andequipment has been s tored throughout the war in this country,U. S.A.,  and Australia.    The amount of materials and labour required for equipping the ship will not therefore be large,apart from labour involved in repairing,  cleaning, polishingand replacement of the already existing stocks.6.      Some deck covering will have to be renewed after the heavytraffic of the war and there will be a certain amount ofunavoidable restoration work arising as a result of the removalof the ship&apos;s armament.7. The main task will be the overhaul of hull and ^machinery and electrical and plumbing installations, which would have to be donewhatever the future service of the ship.8.      The position   is therefore,  that there will be no undueluxury and that most of the fittings and furnishings are already in existence and need only cleaning ape! replacing.(Intld. )    A.B.lrdstry of War Transport,27th February,  1946.COPY NO.    2
