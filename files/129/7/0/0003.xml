THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1946.SECRET. CoPy.No-CP. (46) 53.Sth February, 1946.CABINET.BALANCE OF PAYMENTS FOB 1946.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.1. I attach a Report of the Balance of Payments Working Party on the-departmental Import Programmes for 1946 and the Treasury&apos;s proposal for meeting them.The Paper sets out the whole problem of our balance of payments.2.   It is a bad picture : (i) Our overseas income from all sources in 1946 is only  700 millions (seeparagraph 16 of the report),(ii) Our overseas expenditure, on the other hand, exceeds  1,500 millions,of which  1,126 millions represent the amended Import programmes of the Departments, and  400 millions represent overseas military expenditure ( 300 millions) plus a variety of loans to foreign Govern-ments, commitments to U.N.R.R.A., &amp;c.3. This leaves a deficit of more than  800 millions. Even if we get theAmerican Loan, and a further loan from Canada, and can go on borrowing from the Sterling Area, we cannot possibly face such a deficit.4. I do not think we can accept an Import Programme for 1946 higherthan  1,075 millions, and the report proposes, in paragraph 26, the appropriatedivision of this total between the various programmes. This expenditure would permit a modest improvement in the variety of diet and provide sufficient rawmaterials and machinery to prevent any hold-up with the work of reconversion.5. Even with this reduction in the Import Programme, we shall have a deficit of  770 millions in 1946. This is  20 millions more than we contemplatedwhen our negotiators went to Washington.6. The proposals in the attached report are based on the assumption thatwe shall get the American Loan; but, until the loan is ratified by Congress, itwould be wrong to take firm decisions on the 1946 programmes as a whole. Inthe meantime, I ask my colleagues for approval for the Import Programmes forthe first half of 1946.7. But I must solemnly warn my colleagues that, unless we can reduce our overseas military expenditure drastically and rapidly, and avoid further overseas commitments, we have no alternative but to cut our rations and reduce employ-ment through restrictions in the import of machinery and raw materials.There is no way round this arithmetic, and all our overseas policy must beconditioned by it.8. I am circulating, separately, a paper by Lord Keynes, which shows, instartling detail, what is taking place.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,8th February, 1946.

ANN ICX.BALANCE OF PAYMENTS WORKING PARTY.THE 1946 IMPORT PROGRAMME.Note by the Treasury.THE Balance of Payments Working Party, which works in. connection withthe Official Committee on Economic Development (CP. (46) 32), must fix theimport programmes for the first half of 1946, and make a provisional determina-tion for the full year 1946.2. It is unlikely that the United States loan will be ratified and theCanadian loan arranged in time significantly to affect imports in the first half-year. This programme must thus be a neutral one, neither taking the drastic action which would be needed if no United States loan were in sight, nor makingcommitments for the relaxations which will be possible only when our north american arrangements are made. In making the provisional full-year pro-gramme, however, we assume that the United States and Canadian loans go through.I.Import Requirements.3.   Departments state their desired imports (Appendix A) as follows :  Year 1946.    1st Half 1940. m.  m.Food        ...............      617 305Raw Materials    ............      375 171Manufactured goods     ...      ...      ...        53 25Tobacco    ...............        46 31Seeds and store cattle    ...      ...      ...        20 9Total (f.o.b.)    .........    1,111 541The food, raw materials and tobacco programmes have been examined by theExchange Requirements Committee. The Treasury have examined the manu-factured goods programme with the Departments concerned. The programmes are summarised in Appendix B.4. These programmes are not related to the same criteria of &quot; need.&quot; Thefood programme represents the amounts required to maintain existingconsumption standards plus desired improvements; the raw material programme is the estimated amount that industry will be able to absorb within the probablelimitations of fuel and labour; the manufactured goods programme coversindustries&apos; requirements of machinery, &amp;c, together with small quantities of essential consumer goods (e.g., furniture and textiles) partly to bring standards of consumption nearer (while still leaving them below) the desirable minimum and partly to increase the surplus available for export over and above the supplies which must be devoted to meeting domestic requirements.Food.5. The imports required to maintain existing consumption standards are put at  528 million, and desired improvements at  89 million.(a) The required stated amounts (e.g. of cereals) may not be available.Allowing for this, and for economies which may be possible on further examination of individual items, but neglecting possible price increases, the Treasury considers that the cost of the actual importson the minimum programme would be unlikely to exceed  500 million.(b) United Kingdom wheat production will be some 20 per cent, below 1945,with no compensating increases in 1946 in United Kingdom supplies of feeding-stuffs, sugar, milk products, meat or bacon but some increases in liquid milk and eggs.(c) Stocks will be further reduced by 400,000 tons in 1946. and are in general(an exception is canned corned meat) planned to fall to the minimumfor efficient distribution: these minima are being revised to take account of peace conditions.[31244] B
(d) The desired supplementary programme is set out in Appendix C; it maynot all be possible on supply grounds. It provides, mainly in thesecond half-year, for increases in the cheese, meat, bacon and sweetrations, supplies of canned fruit and vegetables for the points ration,big increases in imports of fresh fruit and vegetables, more wines andspirits, and a wide range of minor improvements, especially for restoring cuts in manufacturers&apos; quotas. These would result inadditional imports of  30 million in the first and  59 million in thesecond half, but there would be little effect upon civilian standardsbefore June.(e) If the improvement programme were carried out in full, and if the fullsupplies in the basic programme were achieved, the standard of nutrition in the second half of 1946 would be appreciably better thanthe average pre-war standard (which was of course reduced by wide-spread malnutrition). It is not claimed that the easements are essential on technical nutrition grounds, but the need is to provide more variety in the diet.Raw materials.6. The raw material programme, submitted jointly by the Board of Tradeand the Ministry of Supply, is  375 million : :(a) The requirements are based upon the estimated capacity of industryto absorb materials, within the probable limits of fuel and labour.They largely (but perhaps not entirely) discount the certainty thatsome of the deficit on the man-power budget will fall upon manu-facturing industry. Stocks are designed to fall to minimum levelsby end-1946.(b) The required amounts of certain materials (e.g. of timber) may not be wholly available. Allowing for this as for food in 5 (a) above theTreasury considers that the cost of the actual imports on this pro-gramme would be unlikely to exceed  350 million.(c) The programme is not in general related to essentiality of end-use.   the criterion adopted by Departments is the absorptive capacity ofconsuming industry and not the end-use of the product made from thematerial. There will, of course, be an increased flow of manufacturedconsumer goods as, indeed, of houses, industrial equipment and exports. Scarce materials are subject to allocation or other forms ofcontrol of demand. As the supply of raw materials becomes more plentiful, continued restrictions of supply on financial grounds has not so far been demanded. The control of end-use will, of course, continueto be exerted as far as possible and appropriate at the manufacturingrather than at the raw material end, e.g., by licensing of manufacture,export targets, &amp;c.(d) An extra allowance of  2J million is included to permit an increase in paper consumption above the &quot; minimum &quot; planned 1946 level (two-thirds of pre-war, except for newspapers and periodicals). There isan additional potential requirement for newsprint (not included inthe programme); restoration of the 8-page paper in April would cost 3 million this year.Manufactured Goods.7. This programme, presented jointly by the Board of Trade (centralisingother Departments&apos; requirements) and the Ministry of Supply and aircraft production, totals  53 million : (a) A machinery requirement of  24 million. This assumes continuation ofexisting screening procedure, by which manufacturers wishing to import machinery have to show need and inability to get a suitablemachine in time from United Kingdom production. In fact 70 per cent,of applications are granted. The Departments do not consider thata substantially increased import would result from easing of control;availability of machinery from overseas sources is limited. Further-more, United Kingdom machinery manufacturers are being encouraged by this procedure to produce more specialised types of machines herewhich ha,ve hitherto been imported.(6) An allowance of  9 million for industrial supplies, mainly related toconsumer goods industries, e.g., textile yarns. It is unlikely that supplies to this extent will be available.
39(c) A provision of  16 million for consumer goods.  A number of improve-ments in consumption are included in this estimate, but the amountsavailable on supply grounds will probably be much below this figure in any case. The Treasury considers that  20 million would probablycover the likely amounts available under (b) and the &quot; iron ration &quot;needs for which supplies will be available under (c).(d) An allowance is made of  3J million on the assumption that a policyof admitting &quot; token&quot; imports from pre-war suppliers of semi-essential goods is adopted.(e) No allowance is made for additional supplies of semi-essential or luxurygoods from war-shattered countries. The Treasury suggest that forstatistical purposes a further  l  million be added.Tobacco.8. The year&apos;s figure of  46 million is the cost of maintaining consumption,with some exports. The United States tobacco from the 1945 crop (which is thewhole of the imports from the United States until October 1946) has been boughton a programme approved by Ministers last September, which involved a reductionin stock to the critical level. The purchases at 1946 auctions will have to beconsidered with the import programme for the first half of 1947.Seeds and Store Cattle.9. This is a necessary Ministry of Agriculture requirement which it ishoped will in future be submitted jointly with those of the Ministry of Food.The seeds are  4^ million; the store cattle is largely a cross-border trade from eire to Northern Ireland.Petrol.10. Petrol imports are not at present included in the import programmingprocedure. Provision has been made in paragraph 16 below on a net basis, i.e.,taking account of the contribution made by the British oil companies&apos; earningsto the United Kingdom balance of payments. The Services&apos; expenditure on oil(outside United Kingdom and B.A.O.B.) is included in &quot; military expenditure &quot;;other net payments for oil and tankers are included in &quot; other receipts orpayments.&quot; It is assumed for this calculation that existing rationing arrange-ments will continue throughout 1946. The Ministry of Fuel and Power estimates that if petrol rationing were removed at the 1st July, the additional cost of petrolimports in the second half-year would be about  3 million. If the basic rationwere cancelled from the 1st March and the pre-V.E. Day stringency of the supple-mentary ration were reimposed, the saving in 1946 would be some  4^ million;the corresponding saving if these changes were made from the 1st July wouldbe less than  3^ million. These figures exclude the additional costs of tankersfor increased petrol consumption and the saving in tankers from a reductionof petrol consumption.Films.11. Film royalties are not included in the import programming procedurebut provision is &quot;made for them in &apos;&apos; other receipts and payments &apos;&apos; in para-graph 16 below. The remittances to United States in 1946 are estimated at 18 million; these remittances take place, of course, after the film has beenimported and depend upon the proceeds of the individual films. There is a verysmall corresponding revenue from the showing of British films in United States,and it is hoped that there will be a significant revenue from showing Britishfilms in the Empire and other parts of the world; it is impossible yet, however,to forecast this figure.Prices.12. The Departments have based their programmes on present or contractprices. Prices of food and raw materials are in general moving upwards. Theeffect in 1946 will be cushioned by forward contracts, but the Treasury considersthat it would be imprudent to allow less than  40 million in the cost of the food programme, and  30 million in that of raw materials.
13.   The requirements may thus be set out as follows :  Food-   million.Basic..................... 500Supplementary        ............... 89Raw materials Basic..................... 350Extra paper   .................. 2(-f- ?3)Machinery ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 24Industrial and consumer goods Basic   ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      . 20Additional (paragraphs 7 (d) and (e)      ...... 5Tobacco     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 4gSeeds and store cattle     ...      ...      ...      ... 20Allowance for prices,056701,126External Purchasing Power.14. The size of the import programme which we can afford in 1946 dependspartly upon our actual effective purchasing power in 1946, but perhaps moredecisively upon the implications for our balance of payments in 1947 and 1948.This is the first year of a transition period by the end of which we must payour way. The resources from which we can draw in the transition period the  937 million United States loan (plus, Say,  25 million from the Lend-Leasesettlement line of credit available for purchases in 1946), the  225 million loanwhich we hope from Canada, some potential borrowing from the sterling area,and our relatively small disposable financial reserves are adequate only if we assume a short transition period, an unprecedented export expansion, and effec-tive limitation of overseas expenditure.15. Looking forward to 1947, we are committed to make current sterlingconvertible early in the year; we can do this without disaster only if our pros-pective external solvency is obvious to all at the time. We cannot do it withsafety unless our current payments are well on the way to balance. At the crucialtime the risks of being left with quite a small adverse margin would be great;we must do nothing to bring about the premature exhaustion of our availablereserves which we might later bitterly regret.16. The following shows the estimated current receipts and payments (otherthan for imports) in 1946 : Exports -Value    ...      ... +700Time-lag in pay-ment  ...      ... -150ReceiptsShipping   ...      ......Interest, profits and divi-dends (excluding oil) ...Cotton and wool receipts...Other receipts  and  pay-ments    ...      ...-I- 550   Board of Trade estimate.A- 65+ 45+ 45Military and other Govern-ment expenditure over-seas4-705-400M.W.T. estimate (non-tanker only).Bank of England estimate.Wool Organisation receipts 25; about20 of our 1946 cotton imports arefrom British-owned stocks overseas,and thus there is no payment forthem.Miscellaneous debits and credits, e.g.,oil transactions, diamond and furdealings, insurance, commissions,film royalties, plus substantial un-identifiable net receipts.Provisional Treasury estimate; includesU.N;R.R.A., rehabilitation loans, &amp;c.
With imports of  1,126 million, the deficit would thus be over  800 million.There are other contingent assets and liabilities. Germany is probably thelargest of the latter; there is heavy pressure upon us for credits to liberated countries; but there are also substantial payments due from them in respect of past supplies.17. The size and trend of military and other Governmental expenditure overseas are crucial. Indeed, our entire ability for pay for imports over the transition period depends upon an implicit assumption that these expendituresare reduced to a very low level in 1947 and 1948. In the present context ofrapidly changing plans, these expenditures plainly cannot be forecasted withprecision. We nope to present a clear analysis to the Working Party beforethe next programme determination. It is thought, however, that the figure of 400 million above already discounts the effects in 1946 of the further reductions in overseas man-power which may follow from the latest decisions of Ministers.Our proposals below must necessarily be revised if later estimates of militaryand Governmental expenditure and the actual development of the contingent-assets and liabilities show our present estimate to be too optimistic.18. On trading account alone, the prospective deficit in 1946 is well over 400 million. We can certainly hope that our overseas income will be much higher in 1947 than in 1946. But imports will also rise. The expansion of industry.and building will mean an additional  50 million for raw materials; if meat,sugar and fats become more plentiful, there will naturally be pressure to raisethe ration; more machinery should be needed for industrial re-equipment. Thisprobably means at least  100 million of additional imports in 1947. If importsfor improving consumption to the tune of  50 million are provided in the second half of 1946, these would cost  100 million in the full year 1947. Indeed, aneasement of  50 million in the second half of 1946 would, if maintained, cost 250 million in the three crucial years 1946-48. Thus if easements are given tooreadily in the second half of 1946, they will have to be removed in 1947. Other-wise, the expansion of our exports would be absorbed by increased imports, andthe gap would remain.19. It would be very easy to justify a policy of no easements on imports in 1946. The Treasury feels, however, that this would on balance be short-sighted,and suggests that we work provisionally to a total 1946 programme of 1,075 million (compare paragraph 13). On the income estimates in para-graph 14, this would involve a deficit of  770 million. The Treasury is notprepared to revise this figure upwards; it involves a larger deficit than that of 750 million assumed in the Washington discussions, and the Treasury considersthat it would be highly dangerous to exceed it. It represents the limit of ease-ments which we can reasonably hope to hold into 1947.III.Import Programme for 1946.20. The distribution of the total  1,075 million between programmes is forthe Balance of Payments Working Party to decide. It may be convenient,however, for the Treasury to make a proposal.Food.21.   A total programme of  540 million, divided as follows : (a) A basic  500 million, of which  260 million in the first half-year; nonormal programme revision needed, but the Department works to this,neglecting increases of price.(b) A  20 million supplementary programme from Channel Isles, Prance,Holland, Italy, Greece, as programmed (and more if possible); this may be  6 million in the first half, but the more than can be got in thefirst half the better. If more than  20 million is obtained, this willnot involve reductions under (a) and (c); if less is obtained, this willnot mean compensating increases in (a) and (c).(c) A  20 million supplementary programme from elsewhere, of which  5 million in the first half-year from sterling area (and very easy non-sterling sources only on consultation with Treasury). The easementexpenditure in the second half should be as little as possible outsidethe sterling area and liberated Europe.
Raw Materials.22. A programme of  350 million, of which  160 million in the first half-year. No formal programme revision needed, but the Departments will work to-that figure. It is suggested that there should be no further easement on paper(its practicality is doubtful on supply grounds) in 1946; we can make no.provision now for any decision Ministers may reach on newsprint.Machinery.23. The  24 million figure for 1946 should stand, and  12 million for thefirst half. We would be prepared to accept a larger programme next time, if itis the view of the responsible Departments that our licensing policy may delayindustrial re-equipment.Industrial and Consumer Goods.24. The estimates are not yet sufficiently firm to warrant programming inthe same sense as the other programmes. We suggest that a figure of  25million be allowed, of which  11 million in the first half year, to cover : (a) Industrial supplies and real &quot;iron ration &quot; supplies of consumer goods.(b) Supplies from &quot; war-shattered &quot; countries (France and Colonies, Netherlands and Colonies, Czechoslovakia, Greece and Italy).(c) Supplies of semi-essentials   under  &quot;token&quot; concessions to pre-warsuppliers.We suggest that until the next programme determination, import licensingshould continue on the same general policy and procedure as now, with a tendency to a somewhat more liberal interpretation of &apos;&apos; iron ration&quot;; but that imports which cannot be justified as &quot; iron ration &quot; should not be permitted except from&quot;war-shattered&quot; countries and as a result of &quot;token&quot; concessions to pre-warsuppliers of United Kingdom. It is highly important to make the best use of our ability to buy freely from &apos;&apos; war-shattered &quot; countries and also to use to the best advantage of consumers the &quot;token&quot; concessions which we find expedient tomake.Tobacco, &amp;c.25.   The crucial tobacco question the purchases from the 1946 United States -crop must wait until next time. The seeds and store cattle programme has notbeen examined in detail, but we suggest it be approved in principle.26.   The programme would thus be :- 1st Half 2nd HalfYear 1946        1946 1946Provisional.      Firm.
