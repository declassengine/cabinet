-    202THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S ECRE T COPY NO.CP. (US) 946th March.  19U.6.cabinet national HEALTH SERVICEJoint Memorandum by the Lord President of the Counciland the Lord Privy- seal the Chief Whip has just been examining the prospects forthe various Bills which are included in the legislative programme for the present Session.      The position is disturbing,-and we think that,in considering the National Health Serviceproposals with the legislation which they entail, our colleagues should have before them the picture for the wholeSession as set out in the annexed memorandum (Annex I) by theChief Whip.      This has been prepared on the assumption thatthe Second Reading of the National Health Service Bill is after easter:    Annex II shows a possible programme for the Bill ifits Second Reading is taken before Easter.2i       Clearly even on an optimistic view,  the National health service Bills, which, as the Minister of Health agrees arecontroversial, will taive a good deal of time, and some of the bills which we had hoped to pass this Session are in serious danger of being crowded out:    Annex III contains a list of the bills which may be in danger^      We express no opinion now on thesolution of this problem,  but we thought that our colleagues should know the facts as far as they can be foreseen.3-        We have not been able in view of the  shortness of timeto consult the Leader of the House of Lords on the prospectsin the Lords,  and he will no doubt advise on this aspect of thematter at the Cabinet.H-. M.Aw G.Great George Street, S.W.1.6th March, 1946.

Sending both Bills upstairs under a time-table inorder to finish them in -the Commons by the end ofJuly.2.    Prolonging the present Session in the Autumn by about six weeks to give time for the Lords to consider these Bills, as well as the Air Transport Bill,which may not reach them much before the end ofJuly.

We ought to open the new Session before Christmasin order tc get a good start with the programme.      Assumingseveral Bills &quot;will be ready for 2nd Reading we should allow a period of 6 weeks of the new Session before christmas -Opening Tuesday,  12th November,Adjourn for Christmas, Thursday,  19th December.No.  of days . -..............    28Address ............ 5 or 6Legislation etc.   ..* 23 or 2228The old Session would be prorogued on Thursday,7th November,  if 6 weeks will be required to complete thework of the Session, we should have to meet after the summer recess on Tuesday,  1st October.      By adjourningon Thursday,  1st August, this would give a recess of 8 weeks,(In recent years  it has been considered undesirable for one House to sit (except for formal Business) while theOther is adjourned.)
