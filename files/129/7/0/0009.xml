THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT      \j45Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.     3gCP. (46) 59.9th February, 1946.CABINET.EIRE AND U.N.O.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I should be glad to have the views of my colleagues on a question of generalpolicy which may arise in the near future regarding lure. We know that the eire Government have been considering the question of applying for membership of U.N.O., and we should, I think, settle what our general attitude should betowards such an application.Our general policy towards Eire as agreed by the Cabinet last year (CM. (45)33rd Conclusions, paragraph 5) is to rebuild and restore friendly relations. i suggest, therefore, that in pursuance of this policy we should support an applica-tion by Eire for membership of U.N.O. if she wishes us to do so. Further, ifany question arises of encouraging other countries to apply for membership, weshould, I suggest, aim at securing Eire&apos;s admission among the first foreign neutralDO &apos; O O Ocountries.In general, on Eire&apos;s past record as a member of the League of Nations andthe general line of her present policy, we should expect to find her generallysympathetic to the Western European attitude on international problems. Itis true that there is a risk that she might take advantage of membership of U.N.O.to raise the partition issue, but I doubt if she would stand to gain much by doing so. On the contrary, we should be presented with a convenient opportunity forstating our own position.It is not yet clear when and how the question of future admissions to U.N.O.will come up. But at this stage all that I ask is that the Cabinet should approve the general line of policy set out above, leaving the details of procedure to besettled later when the question arises.A.Dominions Office, S. W-1,Qth February, 1946.[31290]
