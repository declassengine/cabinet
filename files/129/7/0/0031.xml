(46) 8126TH FEBRUARY.   1946COPY NO.tCABINETMALAYAN POLICYMetnor and um. by -Secretary of State for the colonies would invite the attention of my colleagues to command Paper No.  6724,  entitled &quot;Malayan Union and singapore&apos;/hich summarises the polictowards  these territories.hich was  issued in January of this year,  and01His Majesty s Government2iofIt willshe policyno doubtare: -he recollected that the main features(a)    The creation of a Malayan Union (to excludeSingapore in the first instance, but toinclude the Settlements of Penang andMalacca).(b )    The establishment of a Malayan Union citizenship,with the purpose of granting full political rights in the Malayan Union to &quot;all those,  of whatever race, who regard Malaya as their truehome and as the object of their loyalty.5. This Command Paper wasSir Harold MacMichael of newthe seq.uelagreementsto the conclusion, bywith the Rulers ofthe nine Malay States, whereby the latterpower and jurisdiction in their States tothus enabling His Majesty&apos;s Government to policy into effect.      The contents of theof course, been made known in Malaya,  and inform my colleagues that I have receivedrepresentations arid protests from Malay organisationsindividual Malays in various parts of the Peninsula,of these protests cometheir r.ignature oi  the agreed to cede fullHis Majesty,bring the newCommand Paper have,I am bound toa number ofandSomefrom the Rulers themselves, notwithstandingnew Agreements and their full knowledge,at the timeGovernment.anxiety from the SultanSultan of Kelaritan,  theof signature,  of the intentions of HisThus I have received protests or expressions of Perak,  the Sultan of KedahSultan of Johore andMajesty&apos;oofthethe Rajah ofPerlis, and I have now received a request, addressed to mejointly by the Rulers of Perak, Kedah, Pahang,  Selangorand Negri Sembilari,  that an independent commission should visit Malaya to consult the Sultans and people before any decision is taken on the Malayan Union proposals.4. I attach less importance,  however,  to these representations from the Rulers,  some of whom are noanimated largely by considerations of their own prerogatives,than to the fact that the publication ofappears to have caused a wide-spread andreaction amongst the more reflectivepopulation itself.      I have receivedfrom at least one Malay Associationd o ub t)gat:the Command Paperspontaneoussections of the Malayci ir ec t r epres representative i onsin the majority of the

States, and there is evidence of feeling in all.      Thisevidence tends to show that antagonism amongst  the Malay-people (as opposed to the Malay Rulers and their immediate circle) is not directed against the conception of a Malayan Union, which many intelligent Malays,  accordingto my information, would support,  out against the citizenshipproposals In particular.      These have caused apprehensionamongst the Malays on the ground that they open the door toa Chinese ana to a lesser extent Indian predominance in thepolitical field (there has long been a Chinese predominanceIn the commercial field).5.        I am confident that these anxieties on the part ofthe Malay population are based on a misunderstanding ofthe proposals, whose intention is certainly not thesubmergence of thai; Malays in their own country:    but the anxieties are none the less real,  and deserve consideration.I am convinced that the main policy, which has been theobject of such careful consideration over so long a period&quot;by His Majesty&apos;s Government and which,  in my view,  isas necessary as it is just, must go through.      Subject,however,  to this all-important proviso,  two courses appearopen:(a) The first course is to refuse to let the malay reaction to the Command Paper deterus in any way from the immediate implementation of the whole policy which we have judged tobe right and fair as an essential foundation for political progress in Malaya.      We mustnot forget    that  in Malaya Chinese andIndians between them outnumber the Malays,and that any step which the member a. of theseraces could regard as a withdrawal of the *political rights already held out to them inthe White Paper could be expected to evokefrom them an antagonism as strong or stronger than that which we are now facing from the malays.(b) The second alternative is to proceed,  as already planned,  with all other aspects of the policy,but to defer the implementation of thecitizenship proposals for a few months.      Ifthis latter course were adopted,  it would haveto be made clear from the outset that HisMajesty?s Government have no intention ofabar. Ioning the principle of c common citizenship,which they regard as an essential feature ofthe whole policy.      It would be stated,  however,that xiis Majesty1 s Government realise the vital importance of this particular proposalto all the inhabitants of Malaya,  and have therefore decided to suspend action in this regard for some few months,  during whichperiod steps will he taken first to ensurethat the proposal is fully understood in malaya,  secondly to consult local opinion asregards the exact provisions best designedto achieve the fundamental objective.      Theadoption of this second course would correspond with the advice given me by the Chief Civil-Affairs Officer, Malaya, who feels strongly that it is neither necessary nor desirable toissue the Citizenship Order in Councilimmediately upon the resumption of civil government,who considers that the Malay criticisms are substantial,  and who represents that we stand, to lose much goodwill in Malaya by being tooprecipitate&quot; on this matter.

6.      If we are to be ready for the restoration of civil government in Malaya on the 1st April,  it is necessary for thesecond reading of the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Bill tobe taken in the House of Commons at a very early date,with a view bo the issue thereafter of Orders in Councilestablishing the Malayan union and the Colony of Singapore.I therefore submit this question to my colleagues as amatter of great urgency.    My own recommend at i oil,  after considering the matter carefully from all angles,  is thatthe first of the two courses outlined in the preceding paragraph should be adopted.    We have announced our intentions clearly and. firmly in the white Paper,   and itwould he most inadvisable for us now to appear uncertainof our policy in the judgement of world opinion.    Moreover,Civil Government, when restored, in Malaya, will in any event be faced with an extremely difficult task,  and itappears to me that the difficulties will be increased bylocal doubts or uncertainty regarding the exact intentions of His Majesty&apos;s Government on the all-important questionof citizenship.    in this above all matters,  I think wemust start on a firm foundation and build on that foundationas best we may.    I have never the&quot; sss thought it necessaryto bring the issue to  &apos;che attention of my colleagues,   inview of the substantial reactions which the White Paperha::, caused amongst the Malays - a reaction which is by now well-known to certain  members of both Houses of Parliament.Ct.K, HiColonial Office,  S.W.1.26TH FEBRUARY.   1 9*4-6.
