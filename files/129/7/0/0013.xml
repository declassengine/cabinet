THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 63.21st February, 1946.CABINET.PROPOSED TREATY WITH TRANS-JORDAN.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.ON the 10th January (CM. (46) 4th Meeting, Minute 2) the Cabinet approvedmy proposals for an announcement at the General Assembly of the United N ationsof His Majesty&apos;s Governments intention to terminate the mandate in respect of trans-Jordan and take steps in the near future for establishing this territory as a sovereign independent State and for recognising its status as such. Theannouncement was made by the Foreign Secretary on the 17th January.2. The Amir Abdullah of Trans-Jordan with his Prime Minister is dueto arrive in this country on or soon after the 23rd February for discussionspreparatory to the change of status of Trans-Jordan, and it is proposed, subjectto the agreement of the Cabinet, to negotiate with him a Treaty of Alliance onthe lines of the first draft attached to this Paper as Annex I. The draft followsthe general framework of the similar Treaty of Alliance with Iraq(Command 3797) but the military and financial clauses are contained in a draftMilitary Convention (Annex II to this Paper) which will have the same durationas the Treaty. It will be seen that the Treaty and Convention provide for a close alliance between the United Kingdom and Trans-Jordan, under which the lattergrants to His Majesty&apos;s Government comprehensive military rights and all necessary facilities for the movement and the training of British armed forces andthe maintenance of bases in Trans-Jordan. In return, His Majesty&apos;s Governmentundertake to give financial assistance in meeting the cost of the military unitsof the Arab Legion, the future strength of which has not yet been determined.^It is intended that the Treaty should remain in force for 25 years, the MilitaryConvention being open to revision at any time by agreement between thetwo Governments concerned. The Treaty will also provide for the conclusionof a Commercial Convention pending which existing arrangements in this respectwill continue.3. King Ibn Saud has announced his intention of reviving his territorialclaims against Trans-Jordan, which include the town of Ma&apos;an and the port ofAqaba, on the termination of the mandate. There will be no reference to thisterritorial dispute in the proposed Treaty with Trans-Jordan, but (since we shall continue to uphold the claim of Trans-Jordan to the area in dispute) theconclusion of the Military Alliance with that country will involve an obligationto go to the Amir&apos;s assistance if Ibn Saud were to press his claim by force avery unlikely contingency in the circumstances. The port of Aqaba has fromthe British point of view potential strategic and commercial importance which make it undesirable that it should pass into the possession of Ibn Saud, who wouldnot be likely to grant His Majesty&apos;s Government the facilities which we shallobtain from Trans-Jordan under the proposed Treaty and Military Convention.4. The Treaty and Military Convention have been drafted in close consulta-tion with the Foreign Office, the Chiefs of Staff, the Treasury and the Board ofTrade.   Mr. Kirkbride, the British Resident, Trans-Jordan, is now on special* On the present expanded war-time basis the cost of these units is  1,743,200; but this figure includes a sum of  650,000 for the infantry companies which are in any event a temporarywar-time formation.
