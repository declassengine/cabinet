THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT r.Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1946. 10^SECRET. Copy No.    3CP. (46) 75.22nd February, 1946.CABINET.BENEFITS IN KIND FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Education Ministers wish to pay Local Education Authorities100 per cent, of the cost of school dinners as from August next. I, on the otherhand, wish to let the present arrangements run on until-school dinners can bemade free to parents.2. It is common ground between us that a change in the grant arrangements will be necessary, but the natural time to make this change is when school dinnersare made free to parents. The ground for an earlier change is a fear that LocalEducation Authorities will fail to develop the service if it costs them anything to do so.3. We cannot afford to give Local Authorities the impression that, because it is Government policy to develop a service, the cost of doing so must necessarilyfall wholly on the taxpayer. The Exchequer is already meeting in full capitalexpenditure on school dinners, and the increased annual cost to the rates of thedevelopment desired is rather less than the equivalent of a rate of \\d. LocalAuthorities must not be encouraged to become cadgers on the Treasury doorstep.4. The National Health Service will transfer from rates to taxes about 30 m. of expenditure, and. as this transfer will benefit mainly the richer areas,it creates a very difficult problem for me on the block grant which I am examiningwith the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland. Thetransfer to taxes of the rate-borne charge for school dinners would also benefitmainly the richer areas, because they now get the lower rates of grant, and would therefore add to this problem.5. The running of catering services by Local Authorities involves a riskof waste. A.R.P. canteens during the war were a case in point. From this pointof view, present grant arrangements for school dinners are by common consentunsatisfactory. The Minister of Education contemplates a costing investigation,after which she would disallow expenditure exceeding the costs shown by thisinvestigation to be justifiable. But she is not ready for this. To begin by paying100 per cent, of the authorities&apos; expenditure in August, and to try to disallowpart of it afterwards, is not a hopeful order of proceeding if we are to get properfinancial control without endless friction.6. The costing investigation, and the working out of the technique of a newgrant system, should come first. Whether the new grant system should meetthe whole cost of the service or not can he considered later in the light of widerdevelopments in the relations between central and local finance.H. D.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,22nd February, 1946.[31349]
