THIS DO^U^BNT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  March 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 95.6th March, 1946.CABINET.TRANSFER OF SHIPS TO THE FRENCH NAVY.Memorandum by the First Lord of the Admiralty.WHEN a French Naval Air Mission visited this country last autumn todiscuss the rehabilitation of the Naval Air Arm, it became quite clear that this branch of the French Navy was in an embryonic state only, and there was ahadmirable Opportunity for us, by assisting the French from the beginning, toeducate them along British lines with consequent benefit to our general relationswith the French Navy and incidentally to British industry. At present theFrench, in addition to their own obsolescent carrier Beam (completed in 1928and now converted for aircraft transport), have oniy a lend-lease escort carrier,the Diaamiude, a vessel totally unsuited to modern conditions, even as a trainingship, and in addition mechanically defective.2. , We have already been successful in selling 30 British Naval aircraft to the French as a result of the visit of the French Mission, and we were alsoable to interest the French in the possibility of buying a British escort carrier,H.M.S. Pretoria Castle, for a sum in the region of  500,000, The Treasuryagreed to this, as payment would have been made in dollars, although the actualvalue of the ship as a warship was estimated at  1,484,250. This deal was nevercompleted, as I agreed subsequently with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Ministry of War Transport that the Pretoria Castle must be sold to heroriginal owners. I learn however that the French did, in fact, obtain a creditfrom their Treasury of  500,000 for the purchase of an aircraft carrier.3. We have since discussed with the French whether we can assist them inany other way, and we have proposed- (a) the sale of another British Escort Carrier, H.M.S. Campania, presentvalue  1-193,000, for  500,000 or even less;(b) the sale of a &quot; Colossus &quot; class light fleet carrier (approximate initial cost,excluding stores, of  2,328,000).4. Since these offers were made the French Government have proposeddrastic cuts in the French Service estimates, and as a result all French new construction will.be virtually suspended for some five years. Further, we areinformed that, while the credit of  500,000 already granted to the French Navyfor the purchase of a carrier holds good until the 31st March, it is extremely doubtful whether any further money could be allocated.5. The present French view is that if they are unable on financial grounds to acquire a light fleet carrier from us they will try to acquire the Duemude at a low price from the Americans, rather than pay a sum in the region of half amillion pounds for Campania. Failing this, they would be forced to convert theold Sea-plane carrier Commandant Teste, a most unsatisfactory makeshift.6. The French are naturally eager to have a British light fleet carrier ofthe &apos;&apos; Colossus &apos;&apos; class, but state quite firmly that they would be unable to pay more than  500,000. I am not prepared to recommend a sale on these terms, sincethe Cabinet have already agreed that the escort carrier Nairana should be lentto the Dutch in exchange for an undertaking that the Dutch will buy a&quot; Colossus &quot; class at full depreciated price in two years&apos; time. Again we haveprospective sales of &apos;&apos; Colossus&apos;&apos; class to the Dominions, which would be prejudiced if we were to accept such a low figure from the French.[31423]
7. It is, however, of the greatest importance to place the French Naval air arm on a sound basis from the start, and by the transfer of a first class warshipto make a gesture of goodwill which should convince even the most hardenedAnglophobes that our actions against the Vichy Navy were not based on anyspirit of malice.8. Before explaining the proposal to which my colleagues&apos; concurrence isnow sought, I should state that the French Navy already have on loan from us6 Frigates, 7 Corvettes, 22 Motor minesweepers, 3 Submarines, and 21 harbourdefence motor launches, of a present-day value, including stores, of  3,248,000..,, j With the agreement of the Treasury, these ships have already been offered to&quot; I the French for  1,500,000 to be paid in dollars. Unfortunately, however, theFrench have stated that they are unable to spend any money on these ships.9. If we insist on a cash settlement they will have no alternative but toreturn them to us. They do, however, ask for the retention of the minesweepersuntil the end of mine clearance, and would also like to keep the Frigates and corvettes on loan until the end of this year. The return of these latter ships would be a serious inconvenience to the French, since the Frigates in particularare now destined for Indo-China to replace lend-lease frigates, and have beenrefitted for this service in French yards, while the Corvettes are being employedon training new entrants.10. As His Majesty&apos;s Government are pledged to assist as far as possiblethe re-building of the French Armed Forces, I consider it would be a mistake to insist on the withdrawal of the Frigates and Corvettes, and as no employment is foreseen for these ships in the Royal Navy, there would be no tangible gainto this country. All the ships at present on loan to the French have, in fact,little more than scrap value to us.11.   My proposals are as follows : -(a) To offer the French the Frigates and Corvettes now on loan for  750,000,payable in dollars. If it is absolutely clear that the French haveno prospect of getting any more money this sum should be reducedto  500,000. The present-day value of the Frigates and Corvettes,including stores, is  1,727,000. The proportionate value of these ships on the basis of the offer already made at &quot; X &quot; above is about 800,000.(6) At the same time to offer on loan for an initial period of two years alight fleet carrier of the &quot; Colossus &quot; class. If at the end of thisperiod the French were still unable to buy the ship outright at areasonable price, I should continue the loan for 3 further years, andwould hope that at the end of this period the French would be willingto buy. If the French demur at so short a period of loan, I should like authority to extend the period to a maximum of five years withthe understanding that if at all possible the French should undertaketo purchase the ship at her depreciated value at the end of that time.We should incidentally save the maintenance cost of this ship, whichwould in any case be kept in reserve, in view of the reductions in ourown man-power and money allocations. The French would be expectedto maintain the ship up to British operational standards.(c) Leave the minesweepers on loan for the duration of mine clearance.(a) Accept the return of the other loan ships.(e) Not to press the French to accept Campania.12.   As no replacement for the &quot;Colossus &quot; would be called for, the above proposals would bring clear financial benefit to this country, and would at the. same time earn us considerable merit in the eyes of the French.  If my colleaguesij agree, I propose to invite the French Minister or Chief of Naval Staff to thisIS country to discuss this question before I leave for India.A. V. A.A dmiralty, S. W. 1,6th March, 1946.
