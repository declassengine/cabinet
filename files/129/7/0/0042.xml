THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF. HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 92.5th March, 1946.CABINET.JAPANESE REPARATIONS: PROCEDURE FOR THE DIVISION of shares BETWEEN THE ALLIES.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate the attached paper on procedure for the division of Japanesereparation shares which has been prepared by the Economic and IndustrialPlanning Staff.2. It is reported that the Americans will propose their own japanese reparations policy about the middle of March, and inter-Allied negotiations will then undoubtedly ensue. It is therefore a matter of great urgency to formulateour own policy on the various subjects which will arise. My colleagues willrecall that this has been done in part by the approval of O.R.C. (45) 55, which contained an initial statement of United Kingdom policy on Japanese reparations.One of the first things to be negotiated with the other countries who are reparationclaimants is the division of reparation shares between them, and the method ofdealing with this is dealt with in the attached paper. It is an extremelycontentious subject which will have to be handled very diplomatically, not leastvis-a-vis the other members of the Commonwealth, who are important claimants.3-. The course recommended in paragraph 7 of the paper by E.I.P.S. appearsto be the one best calculated to lead to useful and speedy negotiations, and invite my colleagues to endorse the recommendations in that paragraph.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,5th March, 1946.[31412]
Japanese Reparations.Division of Shares.At the first meeting this year of the Overseas Reconstruction Committee onthe 4th January, Ministers approved the recommendation in the paperO.R.C. (45) 55 on Japanese Reparations, that the United Kingdom representative on the Far Eastern Commission should be instructed to propose to that commission that it should set up a Sub-Committee to make recommendations on the general policies which should govern reparations, the terms of reference of theSub-Committee to be as stated in Appendix II to that paper. Telegrams have,been duly sent to the United Kingdom representative putting that recommendationinto effect, and the representative has circulated the proposal to the Commission.2. A telegram has now been received from His Majesty&apos;s Embassy atWashington, stating that they have ascertained informally that the state department will shortly propose to the Governments represented on the far eastern Commission the establishment of a Reparations Commission having thesame membership and voting procedure as the Far Eastern Commission. the exact terms of reference of the proposed Commission were, however, not made known.3. Since the recommendation mentioned in paragraph 1 above was made,further thought has been given to one aspect of the matter, namely, the methodof arriving at a division of reparation shares between the Allied nations, and theconclusion has been reached that it will be impossible to arrive at any suchdivision on the basis of statistics showing respective losses and contributions of war effort, &amp;c. At the same time, it is necessary to proceed urgently withinterim deliveries of plant from Japan. With a view, therefore, to reaching agreement quickly, it is suggested that it would be better to try to reach anagreement about the division of shares with the Governments concerned on broadpolitical lines, leaving decisions on what constitute Japanese reparations assets and what each Allied share should consist of to be decided later by some other allied body.4. It would seem that such a division might work out somewhat on thefollowing lines (on the arbitrary assumption that the value of Japanese overseasassets will equal that of deliveries from Japan) : ChinaUnited States and PhilippinesOther foreign countries (Russia,N.E.I., French Indo-China,Norway and other foreignclaimants, including possiblyPortugal and Siam) ...British Commonwealth......OverseasAssets(Percentageof Total)805105Deliveriesfrom Japan(Percentageof Total).10352035TotalReparations(Percentageof Total).&apos;452015205. Whatever the division ultimately agreed upon, it will inevitably be theresult of hard bargaining and it would therefore be advantageous if, beforediscussions begin in the Reparations Conference, an understanding could bereached between the United Kingdom and other interested members of theCommonwealth regarding the shares each would aim at securing. If such an understanding could be reached, tHen the Commonwealth Delegations to the reparations Commission would be able to give mutual support to each other&apos;sclaims. It is thought that sufficient statistical data exist in regard to Common-wealth losses and war effort to form a basis of discussion between theCommonwealth members even if they cannot be used for that purpose betweenAllies. A provisional estimate of such losses and contributions towards the war effort, based on such statistical information as is at present available here, is appended.   An unweighted average of this statistical data (as is shown in the* Shipping losses are not taken into account here since His Majesty&apos;s Government havereserved their position regarding the manner in winch the value of shipping allocated inreparations should be assessed.
-    198last column of the Appendix) would give to members of the Commonwealth thefollowing division of total deliveries from Japan : about 18 per cent, to the UnitedKingdom, Burma and the Colonies, about 10 per cent, to India, and about 7 percent, to Australia, New Zealand and Canada totalling the 35 per cent, indicatedin paragraph 4. It is not suggested, however, that an unweighted average is necessarily the correct method of arriving at such a division, and approval is notsought for any figures at this stage.6. If an understanding is to be reached with the Commonwealth Govern-ments interested, it will be necessary to make an early approach to them.Commonwealth Governments were previously informed of the earlier proposalsmentioned in paragraph 1, and the Australian Government have replied statingthat they were in general agreement. If the approach is to be made, it will be advisable to give them advance notice of the new proposal for a division of japanese reparations on broad political lines and to give them an opportunityof commenting on it before it is put before the Far Eastern Commission.7.   It is accordingly recommended: (a) That His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom should seek agreement with other Allied Powers to a division of japanese reparations on broad political lines (rather than on a statistical basis);(b) that the Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and india should be informed of the proposal at (a) with the suggestion that itwould be mutually advantageous for the different members of theCommonwealth to reach, possibly by means of discussions between theCommonwealth Delegations at Washington, a preliminary under-standing regarding the shares which each would aim at securing;(c) that after these Governments have had a brief interval in which to com-ment on the proposal at (a), the United Kingdom representative in washington should be instructed to lay it before the Far eastern commission.23rd February, 1946.
