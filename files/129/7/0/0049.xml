(46) 99.14 A March, 1946.CABINET.BRABAZON I TYPE AIRCRAFT: CONSTRUCTION OF new buildings AND RUNWAY AT FILTON (BRISTOL)AIRFIELD.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Committee.THE Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production has laid before usproposals (CP. (46) 45) for the provision of facilities, including the constructionof a runway 2,750 yards long, and a final assembly and flight testing shed forthe construction of prototypes of the Brabazon I type aircraft.2. Authority for the design and construction of two prototypes of this aircraft was given by the War Cabinet in December 1943 (W.M. (43) 167th Con-clusions, Minute 2). An order was accordingly placed with the Bristol aeroplane company at Filton, which at that time was the only concern in a position toundertake the work. It was appreciated that the existing runway at Filtonowned by the Company would have to be extended and other facilities providedfor final assembly and flight testing, but the nature of these could not be estimatedwith any degree of accuracy until the work of design had advanced some way.In fact, it was not until January 1945 that firm proposals were formulated. Thematter came before the Cabinet in June 1945 (CM. (45) 7th Conclusions, Minute and CM. (45) 10th Conclusions, Minute 3), and the then Minister of aircraft production was authorised to start work in connection with the constructionof the shed, and to incur commitments not exceeding  50,000.3. The Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production now desiresauthority (a) to acquire 180 acres of land (total cost, including compensation,  175,000)and to construct a runway at a cost of  1,313,250 the total cost ofthis operation including demolitions, rehousing and road alterationsbeing  1.838,250, and(6) to construct an assembly building and flight shed at a cost of  1,410,000.4. The total cost of the project, including the construction of airframesand engines is  7,535,250. Revised details of the estimated expenditure are set out in the Annex to this Paper. (These replace the estimates appended to cp. (46) 45.)5. In view of the magnitude of the sums involved, we have felt it necessaryto review the project as a whole.The Brabazon I is an aircraft weighing about 250,000 lbs., with a wing spanof 210 feet and powered by 8 engines. It is intended for non-stop operationbetween London and New York and is the only British aircraft so far ordered whichwill be capable of direct flights between the two cities in both directions in allweathers. Elimination of stops not only makes for economy of flight but, what is far more important, greatly increases the safety factor. The proportion of aircraft accidents in flight is negligible as compared with the proportion incurred[31478] ^ &apos; b
on take-off or landing and it follows, therefore, that elimination of intermediatestops is conducive to safety.Provided the anticipations are realised the Brabazon I aircraft will also be thefastest British aircraft ordered for the Atlantic route and this, together with itslarge pay-load capacity, should enable it to operate on a competitive basis. It shows a substantial estimated economy of operation over other aircraft, British and american, on the stopping route across the Atlantic, and may be expected to compare favourably with its American contemporaries on the London-New Yorknon-stop route.6. The first aircraft will be powered with Centauras reciprocating engines and the second and subsequent two with Proteus gas turbines. The reason for thisis that when the first design was completed the gas turbine had not been developed to a stage at which it could be incorporated in an aircraft. This new development will render the Centaurus version obsolescent (indeed, it is probablyunder-powered as a commercial machine) but it will be essential to use the proto-type with Centaurus engines in order to obtain early flying experience with the type and complete the development work required, in good time for production.7. Although, broadly speaking, the Brabazon I marks the beginning of anew era in air transport, it is a logical development in aeronautical progressfrom our existing knowledge and experience. There is no doubt that the generalexperience which will be gained by the Bristol Aeroplane Company in theconstruction and development of this large aircraft will be of value to the industry as a whole and will assist in meeting future Air Staff requirements for military aircraft of comparable size. The Air Ministry lay particular stress on this aspect of the project and they are very anxious that there should be capacity in thiscountry of the type now under consideration.8. Moreover, we cannot afford to lag behind the Americans in the develop-ment of aircraft of this type. They are known to be constructing two largeaircraft comparable with the Brabazon I the Super Clipper with an all-upweight of 320,000 lbs., of which a prototype in bomber form is due to fly in a fewmonths&apos; time, and the Lockheed Constitution with an all-up weight of184,000 lbs., of which a prototype in the form of a Naval transport is due to flyin April 1946. Orders for both these aircraft in civil versions have been receivedfrom Pan-American Airways.The Super Clipper, although rather heavier than the Brabazon I, is of thesame general design and it is significant that American designers workingindependently have arrived at,much the same answer as we have to the problemof the best aircraft for the transatlantic route.9. We are informed by the Ministry of Civil Aviation that B.O.A.C. areprepared to agree to orders for three Mark II Brabazon aircraft (i.e., the typepowered with gas turbines) being placed on their behalf, but that they do not regard the Mark I with Centaurus engines as a satisfactory aircraft for itsintended purpose. We are bound to point out that the Ministry of Civil Aviationdo not regard either Mark of the Brabazon I with great enthusiasm, and, if thematter were to be determined solely on the operators opinion of the worth of this aircraft and the number ordered, we should have felt hesitation in recommending that the project should be proceeded with. But we are confident that the verygreat advantages, which it is urged will arise in the way of experience inaeronautical knowledge from the development of this aircraft, is such that wecannot afford to abandon the project. To do so, would cause us to fall behind the United States in this respect and would make us entirely dependent on themfor, aircraft with which to compete on the important transatlantic route, andBritish aeronautical development and, the prestige of the British aero industry would suffer a setback from which it would be difficult to recover. . .&apos;-10,   We conclude, therefore, that the project must be carried to finality.   ,11. We now turn to the question of acquiring the land and carrying outthe other works necessary to the extension of the existing runway in time to permit the Mark I prototype to begin its flight trials in May 1947. Work will have tobe begun on the runway at once if it is to be completed by this date. The soilis heavy and tends to become badly waterlogged in wet weather, and it will benecessary, therefore, to make the best possible use of this summer for constructionwork. If this summer is lost, the runway will not be available for use when theaircraft is ready to fly and for the best part of the year it will be confined toits shed.
- 12. In order to avoid the serious delay which would be involved if he wereto proceed by the normal method of introducing a hybrid Bill for the compulsory acquisition of the 180 acres of land required for the runway, the Minister ofSupply and of Aircraft Production proposes to use the powers contained in theDefence Acts, 1842-1935, which were conferred on him by the Ministry of SupplyAct, 1939, and made available for purposes such as this by the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Act, 1945;*The Minister points out that his proposal to use the compulsory powerscontained in the Defence Acts could be justified on the grounds that theacquisition of the land is a matter of overriding urgency and that it is part ofthe Government policy to vest compulsory powers to acquire land for civil air-fields in the Minister of Civil Aviation in the near future. He would proposeto reduce local grievances as far as possible by confining compulsory purchase tothe minimum land required for the runway and by local consultations with landowners, farmers and others concerned. In addition, he proposes to hold a meetinglocally so that all local interests concerned can make their case and be made aware of what is intended. He has informed us that his enquiries show that there islikely to be relatively little local opposition to his proposals.13. In view of the great urgency, we agree that the land required for theconstruction of the runway should be acquired in the way proposed by theMinister of Supply and Aircraft Production.14. As regards the rehousing of people whose homes will have to bedemolished, we are informed that it has now been agreed provisionally with theTreasury and the Ministry of Health that the local authority will be invitedto provide new houses in replacement of the thirty-six to be demolished, on theunderstanding that the Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production willprovide the building labour from their allocation and will compensate the localauthority in respect of the statutory rate contribution, which, together with the contribution payable by the Exchequer, is designed to enable houses generally to be let at reasonable rents. It is proposed that the compensation should takethe form of a sum equivalent to the capitalised value of the statutory rate contribution, and this sum is estimated at  5,400, To this there might haveto be added some contribution towards the cost of providing water and sewersto the substituted houses.15. Some of the land is at present used for agriculture and the problems involved in displacing agriculturalists depend upon whether it is ultimatelydecided that the Ministry of Civil Aviation should establish the main Bristolcivil air port at Filton (see paragraph 18 below). If it is decided not to proceedwith the establishment of the Bristol civil air port at Filton, it will be necessaryto provide permanent alternative farm houses and farm buildings to enable any land purchased, which is not directly needed for the construction of the runway,to be farmed, and it is estimated that the cost involved would be- of the orderof  50,000. Arrangements for the replacement of these buildings could bemade, if necessary, by the Ministry of Agriculture anticipating future powersto be taken in legislation next session. In the meantime, the Ministry ofAgriculture will endeavour to make arrangements for farming to the greatest possible extent the additional land which can be bought and made available.For this purpose temporary buildings, such as Army huts, blister hangars, willbe needed and the Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production has agreedto see that these are supplied and erected before existing farm houses and farm buildings are demolished. As the amount and location of the surplus land which can be bought by voluntary negotiation will affect very closely theagricultural use of the farms involved, the Ministry of Supply and aircraft production will keep in the closest touch with the Ministry of Agriculture, andwill be guided by their advice in deciding whether or not it is desirable for additional land to be purchased.16. The Filton By-Pass Road crosses the runway site at its western end.This road will have to be closed and it will be necessary to widen the existing* In addition.to the cost of these 180 acres, it will be necessary to pay compensation forseverance, or alternatively to acquire a larger area of land to avoid severance on voluntary saleby the owners. The total cost of these transactions is not expected to exceed  175,000 (see annex).&amp; [31478] b 2
trunk road to the east of the airfield (anticipating work which would have tobe carried out at the expense of the Government some time in the future), andto rearrange roads to the south, including the provision of an alternative road to the Filton By-Pass between Henbury and the north. The total cost will amount to  300,000.The closing of the Filton By-Pass will be delayed until as late a stage in the work as possible. We are informed, however, that the legal position isthat existing roads cannot be closed until alternative roads &apos;&apos; nearer or morecommodious to the public &quot; have been constructed and opened to traffic.It cannot be said that any possible alternative to the Filton By-Pass is eitherhearer or more commodious to the public and the provision of new roads, there-fore, will involve negotiation with the highway authorities, and, in the absenceof special powers, these authorities will have to acquire the necessary land under existing procedure, which is slow. It is difficult to say, in advance of con-sultation, what the attitude of the highway authorities will be, but it is hopedthat they will co-operate.. 17. We have given some consideration to the arrangements for remuneratingthe Bristol Aeroplane Company in the light of the large capital expendituresproposed to be provided from public funds. We understand that, with regardto the aircraft, it has been agreed to pay for work on the prototypes and thepower units on the basis of actual costs, and that it is intended to negotiate a fixed fee by way of profit on the design and construction of the aircraft and engines of the order of  120,000- 150,000, i.e., equivalent to a profit of 3 percent, to 3J per cent.With regard to the runway and assembly shed, the terms of user which willbe negotiated with the Bristol Aeroplane Company will include the following : (a) Ownership of the extension to the runway will vest in the Crown, and along lease of the Company&apos;s site on which the assembly shed is to be erected will be granted to the Minister by the Company, who in turnwill be licensed to use it;(&amp;) the Company will pay rent for the use of the assembly shed and runway,based upon their capital cost and having regard to the probable lengthof their useful life;(c) the Company will be required to make the capacity available to othercontractors if required to do so by the Government;(d) account will be taken of the cost of improvements made at public expenseto the Company&apos;s section of the runway in the price which isnegotiated with the Company when it is bought from them for thepurpose of the civil airport (see paragraph 18 below).18. The proposed long-term use of the site as a permanent airfield forBristol has an important bearing on the question of land acquisition and, althoughit is not directly related to the development of the project, we have felt itnecessary to give some consideration to it.The Ministry of Civil Aviation propose that Bristol should be an importantcommunication centre in the internal network of air services, and it is alsointended that services should operate from Bristol direct to the Continent. Thepre-war municipal airport at Whitchurch is quite inadequate and is incapable of further improvement. The only other alternative to Filton as the civil airportfor Bristol is the R.A.F. airfield ait Lulsgate Bottom, which will, in any case, haveto be used temporarily during the development of Filton. It has a number of serious operational disadvantages and, although the cost of further development would probably be less than that at Filton, the resulting airport at LulsgateBottom would not be so good.To make Filton into a good civil airport two new runways in addition tothe main big. runway would have to be constructed and terminal buildings and hangars would also be necessary.*For these purposes, it would be necessary for the Minister of Civil Aviationto acquire up to about 520 acres of land, in addition to the 180 acres to be acquired by the Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production, and theproposal would involve displacement of agriculturalists and others beyond thatdealt with in paragraph 15 above and the provision of accommodation for the auxiliary Air Force Squadron.* Filton will also continue to be required as the base of an Auxiliary Air Force Squadron.
19. Prima facie, it seems to us that, if it is decided to spend large sums of public money on the construction of a runway at Filton, there are good grounds for justifying the establishment of the main Bristol civil airport in that location,and the Ministry of Civil Aviation agree with this view. The matter is,however, one for further consideration by the Ministry of Civil Aviation inconsultation with the Treasury and other Departments concerned when furtherinformation is available on such matters as the additional cost which would be involved and the operational advantages which may result.As indicated in paragraph 17 above, provision has been made in the termsof user to be negotiated with the Bristol Aeroplane Company for the cost of improvements made at public expense to the Company&apos;s section of the runwayto be taken into account in the price which is to be negotiated wdth the Companyif and when it is bought from them for the purpose of the civil airport.20.   The following is a summary of our conclusions : (1) The Brabazon I type aircraft is the only British aircraft so far orderedwhich will be capable of non-stop journeys on the London-New Yorkroute and of competing with comparable American types (para-graphs 4 and 8).(2) We observe that the Ministry of Civil Aviation are prepared to supportthe construction of the Proteus-engined version of the Brabazon I aircraft, although they do not regard it with great enthusiasm, andthat B.O.A.C. are prepared to agree to orders being placed for threesuch aircraft (paragraph 9).(3) Although due weight must be given to the opinion of the Ministry ofCivil Aviation, we feel that the very great advantages in the way of experience and aeronautical knowledge, both for civil and military purposes, which will be derived from the development of this aircraftjustify continuing with the project. We are supported in this viewby the fact that, if we abandon the project now, we shall be entirelydependent on the United States for aircraft with which to compete with them on the Transatlantic route (paragraphs 7, 9 and 10).(4) Although it may have no commercial use, we consider that the construc-tion of the prototype with Centaurus engines is justified because itwill enable flying tests of the airframe to be completed in good timefor production, and we point out that a prototype of a comparableUnited States aircraft (the Lockheed Constitution) will be flying inApril of this year (paragraphs 6 and 8).(5) We consider that, in view of the over-riding urgency of beginning workon the runway at once if the programme of construction is not to be seriously delayed, the Minister of Supply and of Aircraft production should be authorised to acquire compulsorily the 180 acres jf landneeded for the runway under the powers contained in the DefenceActs, 1842-1935. We note that the Minister does not anticipate greatlocal opposition to his proposals and that he intends to hold a localmeeting at which those whose interests will be affected can make their case and be made aware of what is proposed (paragraphs 12 and 13).(6) We are informed that the Minister of Supply and of Aircraft production will provide building labour for the replacement of the 36 houses tobe demolished and will compensate the local authority in respect ofthe statutory rate contribution and the contribution payable by theExchequer (paragraph 14).(7) Arrangements will be made to enable any land purchased, which is not directly needed for the construction of the runway, to be farmed, andthe Minister of Supply and of Aircraft Production will keep in the closest touch with the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries in regardto the voluntary acquisition of additional land (paragraph 15).(8) It will be necessary to close the Filton By-Pass road, widen the existingtrunk road to the east of the airfield, and to rearrange roads to thesouth. The provision of new roads will involve negotiation with the highway authorities, but the closing of the Filton By-Pass can be leftto a late stage in the work (paragraph 16).
(9) Adequate arrangements will be made in the agreement for the remunera-tion of the Bristol Aeroplane Company to safeguard the very largepublic investment which&apos; will be made at their premises (para-graph 17).(10) Prima facie, it seems to us that, if it is decided to spend large sums ofpublic money on the construction of a runway at Filton, there are goodgrounds for justifying the establishment of the main Bristol civilairport in that location. The matter is, however, one for furtherconsideration by the Minister of Civil Aviation in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and other Ministers concerned(paragraphs 18 and .19).A.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14*/i March, 1946.
