THIS DOCUMENT iS THE ROP^RT   OF HIS BRITAN NIC MAJ BSTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 74.21st February, 1946.CABINET.BENEFITS IN KIND FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN.Joint Memorandum by the Minister of Education and Secretary of Statefor Scotland.Discussion in the Lord President&apos;s Committee.THE Lord Presidents Committee, at their meeting on the 15th February,1946,* had before them a memorandum submitted by us containing the following recommendations which we made in view of the proposed introduction of CashFamily Allowances in August 1946(a) School Milk, for which parents at present pay a reduced price of l\d. perpint (except in cases of hardship), should be made free of charge ingrant-aided primary and secondary schools in August 1946.(b) Payment for School Dinners should be continued until facilities areavailable to practically all schools and are sufficient to cope with the expected demand. The present charge for school dinners, which maynot exceed the cost of food, is generally about 5d.(c) The rate of grant for School Dinners (payable from the Exchequer toLocal Education Authorities) should be 100 per cent, from August1946 instead of varying from 70 per cent, to 95 per cent, accordingto the area, as at present.(d) An early and definite announcement should be made covering the above decision to make School Milk free of charge, stating the governments intention to make dinners also free of charge, but explaining that thedate for this must depend on the speed with which all areas can bemade ready to meet the demand and impressing on Authorities the consequential need to hasten the requisite expansion of the Service.This announcement would include a reference to the rate of grant see (c) above.2. The Lord Presidents Committee accepted recommendations (a) and (b)but decided that recommendations (c) and (d), which hang together, should besubmitted to the Cabinet. The following paragraphs are accordingly confined to these latter two recommendations.School Dinners, an integral part of Benefits in Kind to be made free of charge.3. The extracts contained in Appendix A to this Paper from the white paper on Social Insurance (Cmd. 6550) and from speeches made in the House ofCommons make it clear that Members of the Coalition Government and of this government are committed to the view that School Milk and Meals are to betreated as an integral part of Family Allowances and as the main Benefits in kind which justify the reduction of the Beveridge 8s. Family Allowance to 5s. they also make it clear that these Benefits in Kind are to be given free of charge to the parents.4. In agreeing to recommendation (b) in paragraph 1 above, the lord presidents Committee were satisfied that it is impracticable to make schooldinners free until the provision is adequate to meet the expected demand. Thismeans, at a minimum, the expansion of the present service by more than half as* L.P. (46) 6th Meeting, Minute 2.
much again, together with the replacement of many existing improvisations.Such a substantial expansion is called for, however, only if school dinners are tobe made free; and, inasmuch as free school dinners are avowedly an integral partof the Benefits in Kind, to that extent this expansion is directly attributable tothe Family Allowances policy.5. We estimate that the minimum essential provision for free school dinnerscan probably be made by mid-1948, but certainly not sooner. This estimate,however, assumes that we are able to secure the utmost expedition and to enlist the whole-hearted co-operation of the Local Education Authorities. Althoughthe English and Scottish Education Acts of 1944 and 1945 and the regulations made thereunder enable us to make the provision of free meals a duty of authorities, the practical position is that, if they were dissatisfied with the finan-cial conditions, there would be no means of compelling them to give such high priority to preparation for free meals, in view of the many other urgent tasksconfronting them. In consequence, the necessary minimum provision would notbe available till much later than 1948, and the Governments position in respectof their pledges to provide free benefits in kind in addition to the cash allowance of 55. would be seriously embarrassing.The present and estimated future position.6. The estimated financial position with regard to school dinners isanalysed in detail in Appendix B. In 1945--46 the gross cost of dinners may beput at about  18-1 million, of which some  10 million represents the cost of food and  8^ million the cost of preparation and service. This gross estimated cost ofabout  18^ million is met approximately as follows : -It is estimated that the burden on rates would rise to  2-7 million in 1946-47.and to about  4 million in 1948-49 on the present grant basis.The above figures relate only to the maintenance or running costs of theservice. The capital costs (provision of canteens and equipment) already fallwholly on the Exchequer either through the canteens and equipment being supplied directly by the Ministry of Works or through the recognition for100 per cent, grant of the expenditure of Authorities in supplying them.An estimate of the value to parents of free school meals and milk is givenin Appendix C.Financial A rrangements.7. It is common ground that, when school dinners are made free of charge,the loss of the parents&apos; contributions will have to be made good by the Exchequer.So far as we are aware, it has never been suggested that any part of this charge should fall upon the rates. The present issue is, therefore, concerned with that part of the cost which is borne by the rates under the present grant formula,under which the rate of Exchequer grant varies from 70 per cent, to 95 per cent,-according to the area.8. During the debates in the House in 1943 and 1944 and in the white paper published in 1944 reference was made to the cost of the Family Allowancesbenefits falling on &quot; public funds,&quot; but it was not made clear whether or not itwas intended that any part of the cost would be borne by the rates. This is under-standable. The debates and the White Paper were concerned with general principles and policy rather than with administrative details, and there was no occasion to reach a decision on the point. Nor was the point raised by theAuthorities at that time. This, too, is understandable. The war was still inprogress and they were still giving all their attention, under pressure from theGovernment, to the development of the service as a contribution to the national-effort in war-time. There is, however, no doubt that throughout this period theAuthorities assumed that the continuance of the expansion of the service afterthe war as an integral part of Family Allowances would occasion a review of thepresent grant formula to their advantage.9. This assumption was neither confirmed nor contradicted in the course ofthe passage of the Family Allowances Act through Parliament last summer. Butby then the war in Europe was over and the Authorities were quick to take the  million.Parents&apos; paymentsExchequer grantsRates79-22-3
point that the continued expansion of the service to a target which would never have been contemplated but for the prospect of actual free meals was directly related to the Governments Family Allowances policy and they asked for 100 percent, grant on the cost of providing one of the Benefits in Kind on the strengthof which the cash allowances had been reduced from 8s. to 5s. The demand ofthe Authorities for an early announcement on the rate of grant was strengthened by the present Governments decision that the cash allowances should start nextAugust.It is true that the capital cost of establishing and equipping canteens isunder the present grant formula reimbursed to the Authorities through 100 percent, grant (or direct provision by the Ministry of Works). But every newcanteen that is opened means an increased charge on the rates in respect of thesupply of food, cooking and service charges, and it is this growing charge about which the Authorities are concerned.The Arguments for postponing an immediate decision.10. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has urged the following considerations in favour of postponing an immediate decision : (i) The natural time to review the present grant formula would be whenschool dinners are made free of charge.(ii) The prospective relief to the rates that will result from the transfer tothe Exchequer of the cost of hospitals and outdoor relief will makeany further net relief to the rates unnecessary and, indeed, undesirableat the present time.(iii) The first step should be to work out a unit grant system (by which ispresumably meant a fixed grant per meal) which would give adequatecentral control over the Exchequer liability and would be appliedwhen school dinners are made free.(iv) It should be left for subsequent consideration whether under the new system the Exchequer grant should cover the full cost, in the light ofwider developments in the relations between central and local finance,including the revision of the Block Grant.The arguments for an immediate concession.11. However convenient it might be to postpone the present grant issue untilthe effect of these factors can be known and assessed, we consider that there arecompelling practical considerations which point to the need for an immediate decision which would carry the Authorities with us wholeheartedly in the school-feeding policy on which we have embarked.12. First, it must be remembered that the date when school dinners aremade free of charge is irrelevant to the Authorities&apos; claims, which are not basedupon compensation for the loss of parents contributions (see paragraph 7 above),but upon the fact that what is for all practical purposes a new service started in war-time is now to be made permanent as part of the Family Allowancesbenefit and has been used in justification of the reduction of the charge uponthe Exchequer for cash allowances from 8s. to 5s.13. Secondly, whilst the immediate relief to the rates afforded by thetransfer of some  2 million from the rates to the taxes would not be very greatin particular areas, the present charge on the rates for this service is growing andwill continue to grow. With the current rapidly-rising cost of the education service generally and the general upward trend of the rates, the present wouldbe psychologically a most unfortunate moment to give the Authorities theimpression that the Exchequer is seeking relief at their expense by pushing onto the rates a charge for what is a substitute for part of the higher cash allowanceproposed in the Beveridge Report. It would be disastrous to any hope of theirwholehearted co-operation and of our being ready for freeing school dinnersin 1948.14. Third, the Authorities are convinced that sooner or later the 100 percent, grant will have to be conceded. They are still very conscious&apos; of what,happened over, the 100 per cent, grant on A.R.P. provision in 1940 and even themost enthusiastic amongst them are very unlikely to run the risk of beingpenalised again for pressing on with the job now instead of waiting upon events.This attitude of mind would destroy our chance of being ready by 1948 for thefreeing of school dinners.[31340]    i - b 2
15. For these reasons we think that, unless the Authorities feel that theyare getting a fair deal, they will play for time, and the hope of getting theexpansion that we need by 1948 will recede and vanish. The whole basis of theGovernments policy for assisting families will be jeopardised and discredit will result. An announcement on the lines recommended in paragraph 1 (d) of this paper is urgently needed to clarify the situation, but if it is unaccompanied byany assurance to Authorities on the grant issue, it will fall worse than flat.16. We agree with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that logically theworking out and application of a more adequate system of control of expenditure should precede the grant concession which we recommend. In fact, such a system is in principle scarcely less necessary with the high rate of grant which hasoperated for this service since 1943 and it would have been instituted already butfor the acute shortages of staff, both centrally and locally, created by the war.But, for the reasons given in this Paper, we think that the logic of proceduremust here yield to the necessities of the situation in which we have to act. we intend that immediate discussions should be opened with the Treasury with a viewto working out a system designed to give the Central Departments still more adequate control of the expenditure whilst at the same time avoiding any riskof damage to the standards of the service. Whether a unit grant system is thebest method of achieving this objective will emerge from these discussions; but no new system could be introduced before the financial year 1947-48 at the earliest.The present administration of the service affords a substantial measure of controlover the expenditure which ranks for grant and we think that in the meantimeany risk of extravagance on the part of the Authorities resulting from the concession which we recommend would be reduced if the announcement included a clear warning that an essential corollary to the concession would be the working out and application of a still stricter system of central control of the expenditureon the service. Moreover, the risk in respect of any possible extravagance on thepart of the Authorities is only the difference between a grant of 70-95 per cent,and a grant of 100 per cent, applied to a small fringe of expenditure, and thisought not in our opinion to outweigh the compelling arguments in favour of anearly concession of the 100 per cent, grant. Finally, in order to avoid compromisingfuture financial adjustments between the Exchequer and local authorities, it couldbe made clear that the concession of 100 per cent, grant on this service will bea factor to be taken into account in the coming overhaul of the relations between central and local finance, including the revision of the Block Grant.E. W.J. W.21st February, 1946.APPENDIX A.&apos;1. House of Commons Debate on Beveridge Report.Hansard, 16th February, 1943.   Col. 1,666.   (Sir John Anderson.)&quot; . . . . Before the publication of the report, they had come to one clear and definite conclusion : that whatever might be decided about cash allowances, by far the best and the most effective measure, within the limits of its possibilities, is thefullest development of the various child-welfare services which bring the benefitsdirectly to the children.....&quot;&quot; . . . . The Government are perfectly ready to consider extending theprovision of these benefits free of cost as part of their scheme . . . .&quot;Hansard, 18th February, 1943.   Col. 2,041.   (Mr. Herbert Morrison.)&quot; . . . . The Government, on a basis that I will explain, propose 5s. a week,which was the figure commonly advocated. The figure was lifted by Sir william beveridge, for reasons which I understand, to 8s. The Government have acceptedthe 5s., plus and to this I attach no less importance than to the 5s. itself thedevelopment of a charter of child welfare, plus a greater freedom for my right
hon. friend the Minister of Health to go ahead with his maternity and child-welfare scheme, which he will do. He will exploit the situation. So will my right on. friend the Secretary of State for Scotland. Then there is the development ofthe education services : of school meals and that sort of thing, which, it seems tome, under this new order of things, will have to be on the basis of universal freeservice. Thereby we shall get rid, I hope, of a factor which is not an easy one inrelation to these school meals, by the elimination of the test for necessity . . . .&quot;2. White Paper on Social Insurance.&apos;&apos; Provision in Kind.51. The purpose of such a scheme can best be attained if a substantial part of the benefit is given in kind. The school meals and milk services will,therefore, be so extended as to make them available to pupils in primary and secondary schools in receipt of grant from the Ministry of Education or theScottish Education Department. These benefits in kind will be free of cost tothe parents and will be available for all the children in a family attending school,including the first. The cost to the public funds will be large. It is estimatedthat when the service has reached its full development the cost of supplyingmeals and milk to children at school will be of the order of  60 million ayear ...&quot;&quot; Financial Adjustment with Local Authorities.176. The introduction of the new scheme will involve a financial adjust-ment between the Exchequer and local rates on account of a number of services,particularly the National Health Service and Public Assistance, and also theschool meals and milk service. Until this adjustment has been worked outafter discussion with local authorities, it is not possible to make an allocation of the charges falling respectively on taxes and on local rates.&quot;3. House of Commons Debate on the White Paper.Hansard, 2nd November, 1944.   Column 986.   (Sir William Jowitt.)&quot;. . . . We do not, therefore, propose to pay subsistence, but we dopropose and we attach the greatest importance to this to pay in kind. Webelieve that to be the best and the most certain method that the benefit will reach the child and, therefore, we propose that all pupils attending primary and secondary schools under the Education Departments should receive, free of cost to the parents, school meals and milk up to the age of 16 . . . .&quot;Hansard, 3rd November, 1944.   Column 1118.   (Mr. R. A. Butler.)&quot;. . . . We shall pay some  57 million for the cash allowances, some 60 million for the school meals scheme  20 million for overheads, and 40 million for the actual provision of food. We have spent some  16 millionhitherto, on the present administration of the under-fives scheme . . . .&quot;4. House of Commons Second Reading of Family Allowances Bill.Hansard, 8th March, 1945.   Column 2262.   (Sir William Jowitt.)&quot;. . . . We have, therefore, decided to give a cash allowance of 5s., and.also to give a great increase of meals and milk, which are to be free for alli children in grant-aided schools. The cost of that is very considerable. When! the scheme for meals and milk is fully developed it will cost  60 million perannum, which exceeds the estimated cost of these family allowances, which is 57 million.   So, I want to point out that cutting down the proposed 8s. to 5s.is not done on the ground of saving. If we take 5s. and these added allowancesI in kind the actual cost is substantially more than the 8s. which was proposed.&quot;

The estimate in paragraph 51 of the White Paper on social insurance is based on the raising of the school age to 16, on a great increase innursery schools, on an eventual 80 per cent, demand for free meals and a substan-tial increase in the proportion of holiday meals. It provided for 5 - 2 million freemeals daily at a cost of  48 million a year, which, with  12 million for milk, made up the total estimate of  60 million.In Analysis B, the figures in square brackets show the Rate burden as itwould be on the present grant basis.APPENDIX C.Value to Parents of Free School Meals and Milk as a Benefit in Kind.(1) School Meals.-The present cost of food is probably nearly 5\d. per mealand the average full charge is about 5d. (with remission in case of need). No partof the cost of preparation and service falls on parents. While no public state-ment has been made, it has been generally agreed in discussion that the Benefit in kind resulting from the abolition of parents&apos; payments cannot be put at more than5d. to 5%d. per meal. This benefit accrues mainly in term-time and when spreadover the fifty-two weeks of the year amounts to Is. Qd. to Is. lid. per week.(2) Milk. On the assumption that the average daily quantity of milk perchild would be ^ pint, the retail value of the Free Milk would average Q^d. a weekper child spread over the fifty-two weeks of the year. Much of this benefit, how-ever, has been available under the Milk in Schools scheme since 1934 and the valueof the new benefit to parents should not be unduly emphasised.(3) The total Benefit in Kind available through free meals and milk may thus be estimated at rather more than 2s. Qd. a week throughout the year, though, asindicated above, not all of it is new benefit.(4) The value to parents of these benefits is, in fact, substantially greaterthan that of an equal sum added to the cash allowance, since free meals &quot;and milkwill be available to all children, including the first.
