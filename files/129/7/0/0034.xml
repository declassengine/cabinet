g DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)124s: B ORTry. (k6)  3k27TH FEBRUARY.   1 9h6CABINETCOPY NO.7s4FINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH CANADAMemorandum by the Chancellor of_the exchequer the object of the negotiations is to borrow Canadiandollars 1,250 million ( 231 million) of new money and toreach a settlement about the 19*4-2 Loan and variousoutstanding claims and counter-claims.      The 19*4-2 LoanIs a Loan which Canada made to us to cover outstandingdebt at the time of the $1  billion gift.      It carried no interest during the war,  but provided that the rate ofinterest after the war should be discussed,  and that,whenever a resident in the United Kingdom sells Canadiansecurities,  the proceeds of sale should go to reduce thecapital of the Loan.      The amount of the Loan was $700million at the outset and has now been reduced to$500 million.2. We asked that both the $1 ,250 million new money and the $500 million Loan should be free of interest andrepayable in fifty equal annual instalments beginning1st December,  1951*3. For internal political reasons,  the canadian government have felt unable  to accept this proposal andhave now proposed to us the following arrangement:-(a) New Credit.   $1^ billion on American terms(i.e.  no payments until the end of 1951 and thereafter repayment in fifty years at a 2%interest, with a Waiver Clause in respectof interest).      No strings of any kind attached.(b) 19*4-2 Loan to continue as at present for five years.This means that the obligation to use the proceeds of sales and redemption or amortisationwill continue for another five years and thatthe obligation to discuss the rate of interestto be paid and terms of repayment of any outstanding balance will arise at the end offive years.      In the meantime no interestwould be paid.(c) Our liability of $1+25 million for the Air training scheme to be cancelled and the settlement ofother claims and counter-claims to be met bya cash payment.

U. Me were asked to send an  early reply as several ofthe Canadian Ministers will be leaving Ottawa almost immediately.5* The Canadian offer was discussed by the PrimeMinister, the Lord President,  the President of the Boardof Trade,  the Secretary of State for the Dominions and myself, with the help of the High Commissioner for Canada(Mr. Malcolm MacDonald)  and Mr.  Cpbbold, Deputy governor of the Bank of England, who had just returned from Ottawa.The decision reached by the Meeting of Ministers was tosend a reply saying that the position must be consideredby the Cabinet before any commitment is enteredinto and setting put the views which the ministers concerned intended to recommend to the Cabinet.6. These views were as follows:-In the first place we asked the Canadian Governmentto consider the following alternative proposal:-(a) a new credit of 01 ,750 million at 1oj interest,subject otherwise to the same financialt e rm s a s t h e A me rican Loan;(b) the 192+2 Lean of $500 million to be repaidfrom the proceeds of the new credit;(c) Air Training Scheme to be written off and other claims and. counter-claims to be cancelledagainst a lamp sum not exceeding $100 million,to be added to  the Loan,  or paid in cash.7. We tola  -;ur Delegation that if this alternative is not accepted,  the Ministers concerned would be prepared,to recommend to the Cabinet the acceptance of theproposals made by the Canadian Government,  subject to two points:-(a) If the 19h2 Loan continues for a further fiveyears it must be on the understanding that theobligations of His Majesty&apos;s Government inrespect of the  portion of the 19U2 Loanoutstanding at the end of the five years are left open for consideration between the two parties at the end of this period,  i.e.    thereis no implication that we shall then agreeeither to pay interest or to continue to pay for the capital out of the proceeds of Canadiansecurities sold or redeemed;(b) claims and counter-claims (other than those inrespect of the Air Training Scheme which iswritten off)  to be cancelled against a lump sum not exceeding $100 million to be added tothe Loan or (if this is not agreed to)  to bepaid in cash.      Sir Wilfrid Sady has been authorised    to raise  the limit of $100 million to $150 million if this is necessary to reach a settlement.

3. As explained above,  our Delegation have been told that the matter must be submitted to the Cabinet before any commitment is entered into..     I think it isdesirable to settle and to settle quickly, both inorder to obtain the $1? billion which we need and because a failure to reach a settlement with theCanadian Government would have a bad effect en theprospects of the American Loan being ratified by congress.      I therefore ask the approval of the Cabinetto conclude the negotiations on the above lines.HID.Trea sury Charnb ers,  S.W.1.,27th February,  194-6.
