(46) 87.27th February, 1946.CABINET.SUPPLY AND TRANSPORT ORGANISATION.Memorandum by the.Secretary of State for the Home Department.THE Prime Minister asked me to preside over a Committee of the following ministers : The President of the Board of Trade,The Secretary of State for Scotland,The Minister of Health,The Minister of Labour,The Minister of War Transport,The Minister of Food,to consider the revival of the organisation known as trie Supply and transport organisation, which existed in the inter-war years and was kept in readiness to maintain essential services in times of large-scale industrial disturbances.2. We have reached the general conclusion that, if an organisation of thiskind is set up, all sections of the community, including employers and TradeUnions, who are the likely parties to an industrial dispute, should be invited torecognise that any such organisation must be the instrument of a national ratherthan a sectional interest, and that their co-operation will be necessary in itsframing and, if the need should arise, in its operation.3. Accordingly, we&apos;have prepared the annexed statement of principle whichwe consider should govern the establishment of such an organisation and wesubmit it for the consideration of our colleagues.(Initialled) J. C. E.Home Office, S.W.1,21th February, 1946.ANNEX.STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLE.IT is the elementary duty of the Government of the day to ensure that thecommunity is not deprived of the essentials of life : it follows that if the normalmeans of supplying these essentials break down, whether as a result of industrial disputes or as a result of an attempt by a political faction to coerce thecommunity, the Government must provide alternative machinery of its own.This fact is recognised by the Emergency Powers Act, 1920. The Act provides[31376]
that &quot;if at any time it appears to His Majesty that any action has been takenor is immediately threatened by any person or body of persons of such a nature and on so extensive a scale as to be calculated, by interfering with the supply anddistribution of food, water, fuel or light, or with the means of locomotion, to deprive the community, or any substantial portion of the community, of the essentials of life, His Majesty may, by proclamation, declare that a state ofemergency exists.&quot; Where a proclamation has been made, His Majesty may, byOrder in Council, &quot; make regulations for securing the essentials of life to thecommunity, and those regulations may confer or impose on a Secretary ofState .... or any other persons .... acting on His Majesty&apos;s behalf such powers and duties as His Majesty may deem necessary for the preservation ofthe peace, for securing and regulating the supply and distribution of food, water,fuel, light and other necessities, for maintaining the means of transit orlocomotion, and for any other purposes essential to the public safety and the life of the community.&quot;The object of Government action in the circumstances contemplated by theAct would, of course, not be to break a strike or -lock-out or to favour one side or another in an industrial dispute. The purpose of constructing an emergency organisation, through which the Government would exercise its responsibility,is to provide the means by which the community can maintain itself while, a dispute, whatever its nature, is dealt with by the appropriate means.It has been assumed hitherto that the best course is for the emergency organisation to be based on official agencies, which would secure the help ofpersons not involved in the stoppage which has led to the emergency. It is forconsideration, however, whether the full application of the principles set out.above does not require that all sections of the community, including employersand trade unions, who are the likely parties to an industrial dispute, should beinvited to recognise that an organisation of this kind should be regarded as the instrument of a national rather than a sectional interest and to co-operate withthe Government in its framing, and, if the need should arise, in its operation.
