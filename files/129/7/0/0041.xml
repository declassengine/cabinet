(ho) 18th Conclusions, Minute 7,I have had confidential conversations with representativesof both sides of the Shipbuilding Industry on the questionof the inclusion of a representative of the Officers&apos;  andSeamen&apos;s Unions of the Merchant Navy in the ShipbuildingAdvisory Committee.      Both sides are strongly opposed to theinclusion of such a representative.      The representativesof the Shipbuilders considered that the most efficientarrangement would he to exclude representatives of theShipping Industry from the Committee entirely, hut if it isconsidered necessary for the shipping industry to berepresented, they would much prefer that representations should he confined to shipowners.      The representatives ofthe Shipbuilding Unions, while-s not on balance objecting tothe inclusion of shipowners in the Committee, are strongly opposed to the inclusion of the Seamen&apos;s Unions.2,      It was pointed out in the conversations that there isfull opportunity for the making of representations on thematters with which the Officers&apos;  and Seamen&apos;s Unions wouldbe concerned through other bodies, notably the NationalMaritime Board.3.      The representatives of both sides referred to these arrangements,  and said that there was no reason at all whyany point which the Seamen had to raise could not berepresented by any of these bodies to the ShipbuildingAdvisory Committee, and,  if necessary, a special meetingcould be arranged with the Advisory Committee to consider it.(Intld.)
