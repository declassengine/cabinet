-    119(THIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CP. (US)82 (Revise ) COPY NO^C?27^I-FEBRUARY^-J.9U6-CABINET.TREATY WITH TRAITS-- JORDANPROPOSED PROVISIONS FOR MUTUAL AID-IN-THE EVENTOF A DISPUTE &quot;&quot;ll^E-2L^B^^-^-l^-G^^vl^^m^P-tarY ^nder-SeEr? * ary^of&quot;Sgate for the&quot; CqTpnies&quot;After considering the memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies (C. P. (lib) 63 ) covering the draft ofa proposed treaty and military convention with Trans-Jordan,the Cabinet on the 25th February (CM. (h6)l8th Meeting,Minute 5) , invited, me to arrange for further consideration tobe given, in the light of the discussion at that meeting,  tothe provisions in the draft treaty for mutual aid in the eventof a dispute, and to report action to the Cabinet at their next meeting.      The matter has now been examined in consultationwith the Foreign Office.2,      The relevant articles in the present draft of the ,vtreaty are -&quot;Article 3*      Should any dispute between Trans-jordan and a third State produce a situation which involves therisk of a rupture with that State, the High ContractingParties will concert together- with a view to thesettlement of the said dispute by peaceful means.&quot;&quot;Article li.      Should, notwithstanding the provisionsof Article .3 above, either of the High ContractingParties become engaged in war, the other High contracting party will immediately come to his aid in the capacityof an ally.      In the event of an imminent menace of warthe High Contracting Parties will immediately concerttogether the necessary measures of defence.&quot;&quot;Article 5.      It is understood between &quot;the HighContracting Parties that responsibility for the maintenanceof internal order in Trans-Jordan and, subject to theprovisions of Article h above, for the defence of Trans-Jordan from external aggression rests with His highness the Amir of Trans-Jordan.      Nevertheless His Highness the amir of Trans-Jordan recognises that the permanentmaintenance and protection in all circumstances of theessential communications of His Majesty The King is in thecommon interest of the High Contracting Parties.      For thispurpose, and. in order to facilitate the discharge of the mutual obligations under Article h above, the HighContracting Parties agree to conclude -a Military convention which shall have the same duration as the.present Treaty,but which shall ho open to revision by agreement between theHigh Contracting Parties.&quot;

&quot;Article 11.      Nothing in the present Treaty isintended to or shall in any way prejudice the rightsand obligations whiOh devolve, or may devolve, uponeither of the High Contracting Parties under the charter of the United Nations nor.  save as may result from theprovisions of Articles 7 and 10, under any other international agreements,  conventions or treaties&quot;,3.      I think that the feeling of the Cabinet was thatArticles 3 and h, as at -present drafted, do not show sufficientregard for the machinery provided by the United Nations charter and also involve a dangerously wide commitment.      The HighCommissioner for Trans-Jordan has in this  connection drawn attention to the risk of premature action by an imoetuous rulerwhich might involve His Majesty&apos;s Government in unavoidablemilitary commitments.      There is also the  consicleration thatwhen the Question of Trans-Jordan*s admission to the united nations comes before the Security Council (in accordance with article L of the Charter) certain members,  e.g.  the U.S.S.R. ,may take exception to the military provisions in the Treaty or military Convention as casting doubts on the real extent of trans-Jordan&apos;s independence.      This point Is of some practical importance inasmuch as seven votes, including those of allthe Permanent Members of the Security Council, would be requiredto secure a recommendation in favour of Trans-Jordan1sadmission to the Organisation.      Moreover, in their present form these provisions.might provide an undesirable precedent for Soviet treaties with the &quot;enemy satellite&quot; countries in eastern Europe.L. On the other hand there are substantial arguments in favourof the inclusion of some provision for mutual aid.      In the first place, it has been made clear by the Trans-Jordan Govern-ment that they regard this  is an essential requirement:    andwithout that they regard this as an essential requirement:and without the promise of a military alliance we have nothing adequate to offer on our side.      Secondly, experience has shown that the similar Treaty with Iraq has had a steadyinginfluence both on the internal affairs of that country andon her relations with neighbouring states.5-      I believe that by certain amendments in the draft treaty and Military Convention (suggested in paragraph 6 below)we&apos; can meet the needs of both Parties and at the same timejustify our position in the face of adverse criticism.I must first however refer to a suggestion made in the courseof the Cabinet discussion that words might be Inserted inArticle 3 cf the Treaty to provide that in the event of a dispute between Trans-Jordan and another State the UnitedKingdom and Trans-Jordan would concert with the appropriateorgan of the United Nations, as well as with one another, witha view to the settlement of the dispute by peaceful means.Such a provision is open to the objection that it wculdunavoidably bring in other powers in the first stages of a dispute, and this might from our -point of view prove embarrassing.     Article 33s of the Charter of the United Nationsii&quot;Articde&quot;&quot;33&quot;of^tHo&quot; Charter is as: follows&quot;1. The parties to any dispute, the continuance of whichis likely to onhanger the maintenance of international peace and security, shall, first of all:, seek a solution by negotiationenquiry, mediation,    conciliation, arbitration, judicialsettlement, resort to regional agencies or arrangements, orother peaceful means of their own choice.2. The Security Council shall, when it dooms necessary,call upon the parties to  settle their dispute by such means  .

clearly assumes that before resort is made to the United nations the parties to any dispute will first by themselves exhaust allpossible means of solution by negotiation,  enquiry,  etc.Moreover,  draft Article 11 of the proposed Treaty makes it clearthat the Treaty does not over-ride the United Nations Charter,which contains a number of other relevant provisions which neednot perhaps be specifically mentioned in the Treaty - e.g. thewhole of Chapters VI (Pacific Settlement of Disputes)  and VII(Action with Respect to Throats to the Peace, Breaches of thePeace and Acts of Agression).      Incidentally Article 51  of the charter (in Chapter VII)  expressly preserves the &quot;inherent rightof individual or collective self-defence if an armed attackoccurs against a Member of the United Nations&quot; pending action bythe Security Council.6.     The following revised drafts of Articles 3f k and 5 of theTreaty and of Article 1  of the Military Convention are more closely related to the provisions and indeed the language of theUnited Nations Charter and should,  I think, prove satisfactory.They will also,  I understand, not be. inconsistent with our presentideas as to the revision of the Egyptian Treaty.Revised Article 3 of Treaty.      &quot;Should any disputearise between Trans-Jordan and a third State, thecontinuance of which is likely to endanger themaintenance of international x^eace and security,  theHigh Contracting Parties will, first of all, concerttogether to seek a solution by peaceful means as provided in Article 33 of the Charter of the united nations.&quot;Revised Article h of Treaty.      &quot;Should either HighContracting Party, notwithstanding the provisions ofArticle 3 of the present Treaty, become involved in hostilities, as a result of armed attack by a third party, the other High Contracting Party will,  subject always to the provisions of Article 11 of the presentTreaty, immediately come to his aid as a measure of collective self-defence.      In the event of an imminentmenace of hostilities the High Contracting Parties will immediately concert together the necessary measuresof defence.&quot;Revised Article 5 of Treaty.      &quot;It is understoodbetween the High Contracting Parties that responsibilityfor the maintenance of internal order in Trans-jordan and,  subject to the provisions of Article 1+ above,  forthe defence of Trans-Jordan from external aggressionrests with His Highness the Amir of frans-Jordan.      Inorder to facilitate the discharge of the mutualobligations under Article h. above,  the High ContractingParties agree to conclude a Military Convention whichshall have the same duration as the present Treaty,but which shall be open to revision by agreementbetween the High Contracting Parties&quot;.Revised Article 1  of Military Convention.    &quot;In orderto facilitate the; discharge of the mutual obligations under Article h of the Treaty, His Higbness the Amiragrees to allow His Majesty The King to station armed forces in Trans-Jordan and agrees to provide all thenecessary facilities for th^ir accommodation andmaintenance,  incln.di.ng the lease of State domain orthe expropriation of private property.&quot;

(The amendment of Article 5 of the Treaty and Article 1 ofthe Military Convention consists of the omission of referenceto protection of our essential cormnunications;    but it isconsidered, that the mutual obligation accepted under Article kof the Treaty is sufficient to cover our rocjuir ement s in thisrespect at all times, even when the menace of hostilities isnot imminent.)(Intld.)
