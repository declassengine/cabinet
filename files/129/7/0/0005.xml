5TH FSBaCURY,   -\9U6 COPY NO.CABINETTHE CLOTHING RATIONMemo panel urn b y the President of the Boardof TradeI am committed to an early statement to the House ofCommons about    clothes rationing.      Before doing so Ishould like  to inform my colleagues of what has to be saidandv/ny nothing more than modest increases can be announced.2, The sise of the clothing ration is determined byfive main factors:-(a) The labour force of the textile industries,especially cotton.      As my colleagues know,great efforts have been and are being madeto persuade workers to return to this industry,  but it is a slow business, and thepresent labour is still only about 60 per cent,of pre-war&quot;.    The position in wool is little better.(b) Out of the limited outcut available (about60 per cent,  or a little more of pre-war),the Materials Committee have to provide forthe continuing needs of Government Departments,which,  though - greatly reduced, are stillsubstantial,  and for the large consumption of textiles,  especially cotton,  for industrialuses - we cannot afford to hold up reconversion,including manufacture for exports,  by shortageof textiles.      Cotton and wool exportallocations are still only about one third andone half respectively of their pre-war volume,and. we could not justify large  increases in home consumption at the expense of postponing any increase of export,   the bulk of which in the textile field, are to essential markets.    Infact, home and export are sharing about equallyin the present rate of increase.(c) The resultant amount available for the home market - in cotton aboet 1+5 per cent,  of pre-war - has to be divided between clothing and household textiles.      The latter have been cutmuch more heavily than clothing during the war,and by far the greater part of this productionstill has to be withheld from the generalIJUblic in order to meet the priority docketsissued to persons setting up house for thefirst time.    An early increase,  or resumption,of supplies of blankets,  sheets, mattresses,furnishing fabrics, etc.   to the home market- is imperative.

As my colleagues know,great efforts have been and are being madeto persuade workers to return to this industry, but it is a slow business, and thepresent labour is still only about 60 per cent,of pre-war.    The position in wool is little better.(b) Out of the limited output available (about60 per cent,   or a little more of pre-war),the Materials Committee have to provide forthe continuing needs of Government Departments,which,  though-grea11y reduced, are stillsubstantial,  and for the large consumption of textiles,  especially cotton, for industrialuses - we - cannot afford to hold up reconversion,including manufacture for exports,  by shortageof textiles.

Infact, home and export are sharing about equallyin the present rate of increase.(c) The resultant amount available for the home market - in cotton about us per cent,  of pre-war - has to be divided between clothing and household textiles.      The latter have been cutmuch more heavily than clothing during the war,and by far the greater part of this productionstill has to be withheld from the general public in order to meet the priority docketsissued to persons setting up house for thefirst time.

(d) From the beginning of spinning to the sale ofmade-up garmenta in the retail shops,  the interval required for all processes ofproduction and distribution is at present ayear or mere.      The interval in hosiery andfootwear is less,  but broadly the level ofsupplies in the shops at any date is determinedby the production situation some  six to twelve months previously.      Consequently weshall not feel the benefit of the presentreturn of labour from the Forces and munitions to civilian industry until the second half ofthis year, and not on a substantial scale untilthe last quarter.(e) Stocks at all stages of manufacture anddistribution are now excessively low,  and cannot be reduced further.3.- For the present ration period an itjsuo of 2l\. couponswas made on 1st September last,  and I warned the public at the time  that this ration would probably have  to last8 months to 1st May.      It is now clear,  as the House ofCommons has since been warned,  that there is no possibility of shortening the period.      In fact the clothing budget for these 8 months hardly balances andwe may even have issued coupons a little in excess of clothing supplies.      An important contributing factor tothis situation has been the heavy drain on our resourcesrecently from quicker demobilisation.      Each man or womandemobilised received in Kind or coupons a small &quot;capital&quot;of clothing which is the equivalent of about 150 coupons ora little more than four times the existing annual rate ofration.ho       The succeeding ration period will run for four months from May 1st to September 1st.      The  size of the rationover this period was settled within narrow limits by thelevel of production in the spinning Industries in the latter part of last year.      The requirements for clothing for those who are demobilised will continue,  especially in theearly part of the summer,  to be an important factor.      Theposition is that for this period the ration cannot be greater than 1h coupons (or at the rate of U2 coupons ayear),  though I propose to release the coupons a littleearlier than 1st May in order to meet the convenience ofthe public,  especially of parents of school children.5. Just as the summer coupon issue is already settledwithin narrow limits by the facts of production,  so the succeeding coupon issue is largely governed in the same way.      The yarn output and allocations in the first quarter of this year will show themselves in cloth and clothing during the last mouths of this year and thefirst months of next.      To suit the general convenience of public and traders,  this ration period will revert to six months (a basis from which we have departed in the19h5/U6 period) and the period will therefore be from 1st September to 1st March,  191+7-      The coupon issue forthis period can,  I hope, be 26 coupons or at the rate of52 coupons a year.      This issue  is on the generous sidejudged against the supply side of the clothing budget,but wool,  rayon and footwear may be  in easier supply thancotton which looks like remaining the most uncertainitem in the balance sheet.

6. There is one class of consumer Tor whom the re la :.\tpresent no provision un&amp;ei* the clothes rationingarrangements,  namely men and women in the force a when on leave.    Hitherto it has not boon possible to allow anycoupons in such cases because it was not felt to meet a real need in war conditions and while supplies for the civilian were  ao short.      But clothes rat ion in;; has beenin force for nearly five years,  the wearing of civilianclothing when on leave is n av generally permitted andmost of those now in the forces have little or no civilianwardrobe to fall back on.      Until the autumn 1 cannot afford to do anything;    but I intend, as from 1st September,to make sufficient coupons available to enable men andwomen coming on leave to wear civilian clothes without having to beg or borrow from their families or friends.Detailed arrangements can be worked out by the officials concerned, but I hope that my colleagues will agree thatthis concession should be limited to those corning on leave for a minimum period (I have in mind 7 days).      this limitation will enable me to be more generous in thenumber of coupons I can allow per head.7. I propose therefore to make an announcement onMonday, 18th February, in answer to an -arranged Question inthe House.      A copy of what I propose to say is annexed.R. 3. 0.Board of Trade,Mill bank, S.V7.1. ,8th February,  19^+6.

annex to ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he has any further statement to make on clothesrationing.Yes, Sir.      As my hon. Friend the parliamentary secretary to the Board of Trade stated recently i cannot shorten the period which the present issueof clothing coupons is intended to cover, and thesecoupons must last until the end of April.      The nextissue of clothing coupons will be lu, for the period ofh months from 1st May to 1st September.      This is atthe rate of 1+2 coupons a year as compared with an annual rate of 36 for the current period.      For the convenience of the public, and particularly of parents of schoolchildren,  these coupons will become valid as from monday, 8th April.As from 1st September, a return will ho made to a rationperiod of 6 months;    and, apart from any unforeseencircumstances,  the ration for that period will he 26coupons, which is equivalent to an annual rate of 52.I also intend this year, as last,  to make the children&apos;general supplement of 10 coupons available in August.Finally, I have decided that, as from 1st September,there will he an issue of coupons to men and women inthe forces to enable them to wear civilian clothes whenon leave.      The arrangements for this issue have yet tohe settled with ray Service co&apos;J leagues and details willbe announced later.
