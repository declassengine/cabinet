THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1946.220SECRET.       . Copy No.      38CP. (46) 98.7th March, 1946.CABINET.ARMS FOR WALES.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AT their meeting on the 28th January, 1946,* the Cabinet agreed to aproposal made by the Machinery of Government Committee that the demand forthe appointment of a separate Secretary of State for Wales and Monmouthshireshould be rejected.2. It has sometimes been suggested that some gesture to Wales in the field of ceremony might be welcome to Welsh opinion. The most promising ideaappears to be that The King might assign to himself special Arms for use in wales, and the Prime Minister asked me to ascertain whether The King wouldhave any objection to such a proposal being discussed by Ministers. His Majestyhas now given his permission for this to be done.3. The appropriate procedure would be for the matter to be discussed bya Committee of the Privy Council (consisting of the Lord President of theCouncil, the Home Secretary and the Earl Marshal), which would have theadvice of the Heraldic authorities. When this Committee had worked the ideaout they would bring it again to the Cabinet, who would no doubt wish toconsider at that stage if the plan were sufficiently promising to lay before HisMajesty. It is unlikely that legislation would be necessary at any stage, as Iunderstand that new Arms could be introduced by Proclamation made by theKing-in-Council under Article 1 of the Act for the Union of Great Britain andIreland, 1800.4. I ask my colleagues to agree that a Committee of the Privy council should be set up as proposed in paragraph 3 above.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1,7th March, 1946.* CM. (46) 9th Conclusions, Minute 5.[31431]
