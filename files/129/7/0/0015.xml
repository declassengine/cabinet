SECRET. Copy No.u o9 CP. (46) 65.15^/i February, 1946.CABINET.DEFENCE POLICY IN 1946.Note by the Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.AT recent meetings the Defence Committee have been reviewing our defence policy for 1946 in the light of the general situation, of the man-power review,and of the facts revealed by the Economic Survey. The object has been to see how far defence commitments can be met with the least possible detriment to our economic recovery. As a first step, the Defence Committee fixed the followingprovisional figures for the three Services at the 31st December. 1946 : Royal Navy...............      175,000Army       &quot;...............      650,000Royal Air Force   ,............      275.000Total       ............    1,100,000These figures include both men and women, but do not include men under training. Adding 100,000 for this, the total target figure becomes 1,200,000. the implications of reducing the forces to this figure have been carefully examinedbv the Service Departments and the Chiefs of Staff, and they are set out in paper No. D.O. (46) 20.2. The Defence Committee also fixed a strength of 500,000 men and women to cover on the 31st December, 1946, the whole of the labour working on supplies and equipment of all kinds for the forces. The programmes of the service ministries and of the Ministry of Supply and Aircraft Production have been adjusted to this figure.[31318] bPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.
3. The Estimates for the three Service Departments and for the Ministryof Supply and Aircraft Production were worked out on the assumption that theabove provisional figures would be approved. The total expenditure on defence on these Estimates amounted to  1,803 million, of which  576 million representedterminal charges.4. The above subjects have now been considered by the Defence Committee,who make the following recommendations :  (a) That the following assumptions should be accepted as governing out.&apos;present defence j)policy : -(i) That we shall not be called upon to fight a major war during thenext two or three years,(ii) That in any future situation the United States will probably beon our side, and will certainly not be against us.(iii) That no fleet capable of being a menace to our security will existduring the next few years.(b) On the above assumptions, and recognising that the reductions proposedwill involve certain risks, and can be secured in full only if certainpolitical commitments are successfully liquidated in the course of theyear, the provisional strengths for the Services and for the labour force working on supplies and equipment for the forces, as set out inparagraphs 1 and 2 above, should be confirmed as targets. In certain eventualities some of these reductions may have to be postponed, and supplementary estimates presented.(c) That reductions in the strength of the armed forces which involve the with-drawal of troops from Europe should be postponed to as late a date as possible consistent with reaching the target figures for the endof 1946.(d) That, with a view to maintaining the efficiency of the forces andshortening the present period of conscript service, approval shouldbe given in principle to the early institution of a scheme offeringfinancial inducements to skilled and experienced men already released,or about to be released, to re-engage for three or four years with thecolours, and that the Service Ministers, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, should work out the details of the scheme without delay.5. When the Defence Committee examined the Defence Estimates, it was proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that an additional cut of 10 per cent,should be made on the Estimates, excluding terminal charges. This would save in round figures a further  120 million. It would be left to the judgment of theService Ministers and the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production to decide
how this reduction should be made, both in its incidence and in its timing. Someof the reduction might be achieved by the writing-up of the value of receipts. TheDefence Committee agreed with this proposal, with the proviso that it mustnot result in any weakening of the strength of the forces, and decided to recom-mend to the Cabinet the acceptance of the Service Estimates at a total figureof  1,667 million.   (For details see Annex I.)6. A Draft White Paper has been drawn up by the Defence Committeeembodying a statement of our defence policy based on the above conclusions. (see annex II.)7. The Defence Committee invite the Cabinet to approve the conclusions setout above, and the text of the White Paper.C. P. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,15th February, 1946.

ANNEX II.PROOF.DRAFT statement relating  TO   DEFENCEPresented byLONDONHIS MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY office net cmd.
DEAFTSTATEMENT RELATING TO DEFENCE.I.-INTRODUCTION.It is the intention of His Majesty&apos;s Government to restore the pre-warpractice of laying before Parliament annually a White Paper on defence policy. During the six years of war there has been a great developme-y inthe machinery for the centralised study and control of military affairs in Oieirwidest sense, without which the successful conduct of world-wide operations,and the mobilisation of national resources for a common purpose, could nothave been achieved. His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to consolidate and extend this development, so that the broad policy governing the size and composition of our armed forces, the progress of research and development,and the production of military equipment and stores, can be formulated and presented to Parliament as a co-ordinated whole. The present Paper is thefirst of the post-war series. It describes the policy which His Majesty&apos;sGovernment intend to pursue during the year 1946, which has had to be framed amid the uncertainties inevitable in the wake of a great war. For a true understanding of this policy it is necessary to survey the trend of eventssince the end of the German war, and the situation which faces us at thepresent time.II.-1945 IN RETROSPECT.2. The collapse of Germany found us with our armed forces at their peakstrength. About 5,100,000 men and women were deployed in Europe, theMediterranean, and the Far East, and on the oceans of the world. Behind theforces stood the men and women producing equipment and supplies forthe forces, who totalled at the same date approximately 3,900,000. A grandtotal of 9,000,000 men arid women from the British Isles were thus in theforces or were directly supplying their needs. We were confronted with threetasks. First, to re-deploy as quickly as possible all the forces that could bebrought to bear against Japan. Secondly, to carry out our share of theoccupation of the countries of our defeated enemies, and of the rehabilitation of Europe. Thirdly, to withdraw into civilian industry as quickly as possiblethose men and women not required for our first two tasks. Outline plans forall this had been prepared in anticipation of Germany&apos;s defsat, and were immediately put into effect, and redeployment was in full swing when, threemonths later, Japan in her turn surrendered.3. The end of the Japanese war cut short this process of redeployment,but confronted us with formidable problems in the collection and return otour prisoners in Japanese hands, in the rounding up of the powerful japanese forces distributed in the greatly extended area for which the supreme commander, South-East Asia Command, had recently become responsible,and in the task of rehabilitating the ravaged territories of the Far East. Atthe same time the termination of Lend-Lease added greatly to the urgency of restoring the balance of our economic life. In this situation His Majesty sGovernment set on foot an immediate assessment of the many conflictingdemands upon our man-power, so that a rapid and orderly redistribution couldbe started without delay. For the purposes of this assessment two dates werechosen, the 31st December, 1945, and the 30th June, 1946. The machinerydeveloped in wartime for squeezing out all non-warlike effort, so that themaximum could be applied against the enemy, was put into reverse. HisMajesty&apos;s Government were confronted with a direct conflict of requirements.On the one hand, we could not abandon our responsibilities in many parts of
the world. To do so would have been to throw away the fruits of victory, andto betray those who had fought and died in the common cause. On the otherhand, the necessity for our economic rehabilitation was imperative. Therewere, however, certain factors which placed unavoidable limitations upon our freedom of choice.4.   His  Majesty&apos;s  Government  were  determined to maintain in  itsintegrity the demobilisation plan which had been drawn up by the CoalitionGovernments and which was acknowledged on all sides to be equitable.  Thepjflbiple of release by age and service could not be set aside, nor couldpreference be given to those who happened to be serving at home.   Therate at which release could take place was thus determined by the rate atwhich men and women could be brought home from overseas.   This in turndepended upon the means of transportation.   In October 1945 a target was set for the demobilisation of 1-J- million men and women by the 31st Decern-ber, 1945 a target which was well outside anything thought possible at thetime by the transportation authorities.   Simultaneously, a target of 1,400,000for the strength of men and women making supplies and equipment for theforces was set for the same date.   If these two targets could be achieved, areduction in six months of 3,740,000 or 42 per cent, in the man-power engagedin warlike activities would result.   In the event, the reduction in the forces was achieved; the numbers reported as employed on the manufacture of equipment and supplies for the forces were above the target, but the figure is probably an overstatement owing to the failure or inability of some employers to distinguish between work for the forces and work for export and civilian use over which control is still exercised by Supply Departments.5. The assessment made in October, on the best information available at that time, showed that we should have to retain in the forces on the30th June, 1946, 2,233,000 trained men and women. This figure, which was announced on the 3rd October, 1945, was accepted by His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfc for the time being, subject to review at the end of 1945. To alter the figure would have been unprofitable, because the rate of release up tothe end of 1945 was not affected by it. As already explained, this releasewas governed by physical facts. The fixing of a figure for June 1946however, enabled the civil industries to make their provisional plans for expansion.III. THE PRESENT SITUATION.6. The months of December, January and February have been spent in an exhaustive review of the situation, so that a firm policy for the year1940 can be enunciated as a guide to all concerned. This is not the timeto come to decisions about the eventual shape of our post-war forces. Thegreat strides made in the realm of science and technology, including theproduction of atomic bombs, cannot fail to effect the make-up of our armedfoi &apos;ces. Time is wanted for the full effects of these startling developmentsto be assessed. But in the meanwhile, and for the year 1946, the questionof fundamental reorganisation does not arise. The tasks which confront our armed forces, and to which further reference is made below, are the tasks of resettlement and pacification tasks which must be fulfilled to theaccompaniment of steady but drastic contraction.7. It is also too early to assess the effect on our defence requirementsof the establishment of the United Nations Organisation. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have repeatedly expressed their intention of giving the utmostsupport to the United Nations Organisation in all its activities. As one ofthe five permanent Members of the Security Council, a special responsibility rests upon the United Kingdom in the maintenance of inter-
national peace and security.   It will fall to His Majesty&apos;s Government to Iconclude an agreement under Article 43 of the Charter for the provision Iof forces, facilities, and assistance, to be on call by the Security Counciland to be at a prescribed state of readiness and in certain general locations IThe preparation of this agreement will take a certain time.   Close touchwith the Governments of the Dominions and of India will be maintained onthis subject, so as to ensure that the contribution of the British Common-wealth and Empire to the maintenance of security will be worthy of thegreat cause at stake. .^8. On any hypothesis, the total strength of the forces which will stillbe required at the end of 1946 is larger than we shall permanently require,though the pattern of its distribution between the services may be different from that in which the ultimate post-war distribution will fall. We thus have time, during the period of abnormal commitments, in which to shapeour long-term plans. His Majesty&apos;s Government have, therefore,concentrated upon a careful review of the forces by sea, land, and air, whichwill be required to meet the tasks of 1946, and of the scale of equipment to be provided for their use.9.   The commitments with which we are now confronted, and which weare bound to undertake, can be summarised as follows:  (a) The -provision of our share of the forces to ensure the execution bijGermany and Japan of the terms of surrender.The task in Germany involves the presence of adequate naval, land, andair forces to occupation)7 effectively the British zone, and the British sector inBerlin, to carry out the disarmament and demilitarisation of Germany within our zone, to deal with prisoners of war, and to assist in the repatriation of displaced persons, and to provide striking forces in case of trouble. The size of these forces is being reduced, though they cannot be dangerously weakened,and the organisation of the Army and Air formations in Germany is beingadjusted to suit the occupational role which they have to fulfil.The task in Japan has been very largely assumed by the forces of theUnited States, but we are providing a small contingent which forms part oia British Commonwealth force.(b) The provision of our share of the forces for the occupation of Austria.It is our desire to reduce these forces as quickly as possible to very smallproportions, and we are in consultation with the other three occupying Powers $to this end.(c) The provision of forces to maintain law and order in Venezia Ghdia.    this task, which is shared with the United States, will be brought to ailend when a final settlement is reached in the Peace Treaty with Italy.      p(d) The provision of forces to assist the Greek nation in its recovery.The policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government in Greece has been made .clear to the world. British forces in Greece will remain until elections:have taken place, and until stability has been achieved.(e) The provision of forces to enable us to carry out our responsibilities 16 iPalestine.q His Majesty&apos;s Government are responsible for the administration oj IPalestine. It is to be hoped that an equitable solution of the political Iissues at stake in that country will shortly be found, but in the meantime, Ithe preservation of law and order makes heavy demands upon our resource- I
(f) T^e  liquidation of the  Japanese   Occupation  of Allied  territories  inSouth-East Asia.The task of disarming and collecting the Japanese forces scatteredthroughout this great area is steadily being accomplished. The civil administration of British territories is gradually being restored, andconditions are being created for an equitable settlement of the difficultpolitical issues in the Netherlands East Indies. Much work devolves uponthe armed forces, who alone have the organisation and resources requiredto bring order out of chaos in territories ravaged by the Japanese, but itis the hope of His Majesty&apos;s Government that in the course of the yearpeaceful conditions will be re-established, thus enabling the greater part ofour forces to be withdrawn.(g) The maintenance of internal security and settled conditions throughoutthe Empire.It has already proved possible to reduce many of our garrisons to thepeacetime scale.(h) The safeguarding of our communications and the upkeep of our bases.This is essential for the efficiency and mobility of our forces by sea, land and air.IV. THE .STRENGTH OF THE FORCES IN 1946.10. In addition to the above, there are a number of considerations whichhave a bearing upon the rate at which the reduction in the size of the forcescan be carried out. The object of His Majesty&apos;s Government is to securethe release from the forces of those who have borne the heat and burden ofthe day. For this reason the call-up of young men must continue. At thesame time, care must be taken not to impair more than can be avoided theefficiency of those forces who still have active tasks to fulfil all over theworld. The progressive removal of large numbers of the experienced andthe skilled, which results from the age and service release scheme, places avery heavy strain upon the organisation of the Services, and a great effort is called for in the training of replacements, and in the retaining of men andwomen with some time still to serve, so that the gaps in active formations canbe filled. The progress of demobilisation, and the movement of replacements,call for a continuous and large-scale programme of transportation. to supplement our shipping resources, it has been necessary for the Navy andthe Royal Air Force to carry many men to and fro as could be done withsafety and without prejudice to the execution of our major responsibilities.Many aircraft carriers and large warships are employed in this way and thetask is not finished. Transport Command, R.A.F., m circumstances of greatdifficulty, and supplemented by .a part of Bomber Command, have beenconveying substantial numbers. At the peak period, movement by air onthe Eastern route reached the figure of $9,000 a month in each direction. this figure could not be maintained, because the process of demobilisation made it impossible for crews of Transport Command with, sufficient experience ofthis work to be kept together for long periods.11. There are two further tasks which should be mentioned, which stillmake considerable calls upon our man-power. The first is minesweeping.The Royal Navy have been playing a major part in this work, which is organised on an international basis, and which is essential for the restorationof world trade. It is hoped that this commitment will he nearly liquidatedby the end of 1946.   The second is the task of disposing of surplus material
of all kinds. A considerable amount of Lend-Lease material has had to bokept in good condition for return to the United States. Great efforts are beingmade to accelerate the disposal of surplus stores of all kinds, but in the meanwhile it is necessary to store and guard valuable dumps, which would otherwise be subject to deterioration and loss.12. The tasks which have been summarised above have been carefullyand fully reviewed, with the object of determining the role to be played by each Service, and the extent to which the task of one can be relieved byjudicious use of the resources of the others. Financial and man-power con&quot;siderations arising from the equally important claims of our economicsituation inevitably impose limitations. His Majesty&apos;s Government, afterweighing up all the factors, have drawn up a programme of demobilisationfor 1946 which is founded upon the reasonable expectation that a numberof abnormal commitments will be entirely liquidated in the course of theyear, and that unforeseen events do not disturb the course of progress towards settled peace.The total strengths of trained men in the three Services at which this programme aims are :  On the 30th June, 1946    .........       1,900,000On the 31st December, 1946       ......       1,100,000It must be reiterated that the achievement of these target figure,&apos;; depends upon the development of events and upon the successful settlement of many-problems left over from the war. It will be noted that the figure for the30th June, 1946, represents a reduction of 348,000 from the estimate publishedlast October. If the figures for December are achieved, the reduction in thestrength of the forces in the eighteen months from the beginning of demobilisa-tion in June 1945 will be approximately 3,900,000 men and women, or over75 per ce,nt.13. His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to continue demobili nation inaccordance with the age and service release scheme and, at least for thepresent, to continue the call up of young men under the National Service Act.[Alternative wording to the above : His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to continue demobilisation inaccordance with the age and service release scheme and, without prejudice to any final decision which may be taken in due course about a permanentsystem of national service, to continue for the present the call up of young menunder the National Service Act.]They fully recognise, however, that it is necessary as sOon as possible to fix a definite period for the length of engagement of new entrants to thefoi-ces. Much will depend upon the rate of entry of volunteers for the Eegularforces, and upon the progress of events; but, as soon as the positi m can bemore closely gauged. His Majesty&apos;s Government intend to announce that froma given date all new entrants under the National Service Act s hall be called up for a definite period, and to say what that period will be. It will then bethe aim of His Majesty&apos;s Government to demobilise as rapidly as possibleall those in the Services who on the given date will have served for longer than the period fixed for new entrants, though this will have to be spread overa period.14. His Majesty&apos;s Government are also considering the measures required for the re-establishment of reserve and auxiliary forces. These would include the E.N.V.E., the Auxiliary Army, the Auxiliary Air Force and theE.A.F.V.E., with which would be associated the Cadet Corps and appropriatetraining organisations at certain Universities.
V.-SUPPLY OF EQUIPMENT.15. Equally important with the reduction of the size of the forces isthe reduction in the man-power employed on work for the forces. HisMajesty&apos;s Government have reviewed the policy for the provision of equip-ment in the present abnormal circumstances. They propose to be guided by the following four principles :  (a) Concentration on Research. Scientific and technical progress at the^ present time is so rapid that safety lies far more in the maintenanceof an adequate organisation for pure and applied research thanin the building up of stocks of obsolescent equipment.(6) Limited introduction of equipment of the most modern kind, eg., jet-propelled aircraft.(c) The maximum use of accumulated stocks.(d) The maintenance of a reasonable war potential.16. It is the view of His Majesty&apos;s Government that a severe reductionin the output of weapons and equipment for the forces is essential not onlyin the interests of our economic recovery, but also to avoid the accumulation of obsolescent munitions. They have accordingly imposed financial and man-power ceilings on production programmes, and they have set as the man-powerceiling for the 31st December, 1946, a figure of 500,000 to cover Naval ship-building, aircraft production, and the production of weapons, stores,equipment, clothing, &amp;c. If this ceiling is achieved, it will mean in the eighteen months since June 1945 a reduction in supply and equipment labour of 3,237,000 men and women, or 83 per cent.17. Taking the aggregate of men and women in the Services andemployed on work for the Services, the total reduction in the eighteen months ending December 1946 will be 7,130,000 or 79 per cent.18. The financial provision required for the Service Departments andthe Ministry of Supply in 1946 reflects the transitional nature of the year the rate of expenditure on the maintenance of the forces and on theproduction of supplies for them will steadily diminish as man-power in theforces and in the munitions industry is reduced. The total requirement forthe year for these purposes will therefore be considerably higher than thelevel to which it will have been reduced at the end of the year. Theexpenditure in the year will be further swollen by the large terminalcharges which are an inescapable accompaniment of the cutting down of commitments. There are war gratuities and other payments to be madeat the end of service. There are charges on the termination of contracts and payments for the winding up of closed contracts. Besides these items,there is compensation for damage on the termination of requisitions of land and property. All these payments conceal the true figure at which currentservice and supply expenditure is actually being incurred on the day to dayrunning of the Services.19. (a) The total provision included in the Estimates is as follows:    million.VI. FINANCE.Navy &quot;...       ...army air     ...       ............Supply and Aircraft Production ...255682256474 1,667 m.
Of this sum, the terminal charges mentioned in the preceding paragraphamount to  576 million, leaving a sum of  1,091 million as the amount required for current service and supply expenditure on the day-to-dayrunning of the services.20. (6) This latter sum is distributed between broad categories ofexpenditure as follows, in round figures:    million.Pay, rations, &amp;c, of Service personnel ... ... 580Production   ...       ...       ...      ...       ... ... 230Works (including maintenance) ...       ... 75Non-effective charges       ...       ...       ... ...        25Miscellaneous (net) ...       ...       ... ... 181 1,091m.VII.-HIGHER DEFENCE ORGANISATION.21. Reference has already been made to the development which has takenplace during the war in the central machinery for the control of our war effort.The assumption by the late Prime Minister of the xiosition of Minister ofDefence, and the operation of Joint Staffs in an expanding field of activity,were the principal features of this development. There was no formal changein&apos;constitutional responsibility, though under the impulse of war the rigidboundaries of departmental authority were modified in the interestscentralised control. His Majesty&apos;s Government felt it desirable, soon afteithe end of the war, to review the position, and to formulate proposals for ahigher defence organisation which would embody the improvements suggestedby the experience of the last six years. It is hoped before long to lay beforParliament concrete proposals.. 22. In the meanwhile, the full measure of co-ordination of the Servicesattained during the war has not been allowed to. relax. Not only in thefield of plans and intelligence, but in matters of general administration andin problems of man-power, the work is on a fully combined basis not onl;between the Services, but also between Military and Civil staffs.VIII.-COLLABORATION WITH THE DOMINIONS IN DEFENCE.23.   During the war, collaboration with the Dominions and India hasbeen   comprehensive,   continuous,   and   effective.     The   long   acceptedprinciple whereby His Majesty&apos;s Forces throughout the Empire have been trained, organised, and equipped, on the same basis, proved its value in tbteasy and whole-hearted co-operation which took place by sea, land, and air.in all theatres of war, between men and women of many races.   Behind ftforces, collaboration in the field of scientific and technical development, din the production of munitions and supplies of all kinds, was equally cfeand thorough.   His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom acknofrledge to the full the tremendous efforts put forward in the common cause bjthe whole Commonwealth and Empire, and earnestly desire to. continue inpeace the full partnership so magnificently established in war.24. It will be necessary to consider with the Governments of HisMajesty&apos;s Dominions and India the way in which the lessons of the war canbe applied to promote consultation and collaboration in defence mattersduring peace. This they hope to be able to do at a meeting of Prime ministers in London in late April, for which invitations have been accepted.[31318] Wt. -- z/46 F.O.p.
