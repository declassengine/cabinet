tU   2.013 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OP HIS . BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMI?POST-WAR CODE OP PAY.  ALLOWANCES.  RETIRED PAY and service GRATUITIES FOR COMMISSI ONED OFFICERS OP the armed forces memorandum by the Prime Minister and Minister1 ofDefenceMy colleagues will wish to be aware of the new conditions of service for Commissioned Officers of thePost-war Forces,  which it is proposed to announce next week.        These are set out (subject &apos;to minor alterationson certain points of detail) in the attached draft white paper.      A summary of the salient points in the new scheme is attached.2. I brought the corresponding arrangements for ratingsand other ranks before the Cabinet on 13th December, 19^-5,and they were announced in a White Paper on 19th December(Command Paper 6715).3. The arrangements for officers which I am now layingbefore the Cabinet are the result of examination by theInter-Departmental Committee on Post-War Pay, allowances and Pensions, whose proposals have been approved by a ministerial Committee consisting of the Chancellor of theExchequer,  the three Service Ministers, the Secretary ofState for India and myself.      The  same general principleshave been adopted in the new&apos; Code for officers as in the code for other ranks:    we have aimed at simplicity and atremoving the existing disparities between the Services,and within each Service.      In general the rates of pay and prospects have been considerably improved.S C R E TCP. (U6)  881ST MARCH.   19U6CABINETC. R. A10, Downing Street, S.W.1.1 st March,  1 9^6.

POST-WAR   RATES   OF   PAY,   ALLOWANCES,   RETIRED-PAY AND  SERVICE  GRATUITIES   FOR   commissioned officers   OF  THE   ARMED   FORCESi. Command Paper 6715 of December, 1945, sets out the arrangements to be made with effect from the 1st July, 1946, for the post-war remunera-tion of ratings and other ranks of the Armed Forces. The remuneration of officers has now also been reviewed, and this Paper sets out the new arrangements which will come into force, as regards pay and allowances,on the ist July, 1946.2. The aim has been to simplify the officers&apos; pay codes and put an end Ath to the disparities which at present exist between the three Servicesand to the anomalies within each Service.      The new codes will resultin a broad equality of treatment between officers of the three Services, while! taking into account certain special factors  (especially ages of promotion)I vvhich&apos; arise at particular points owing to differing Service requirements.There will now be a uniform system of marriage allowance, and also ofI gratuities and retired pay.3. The review has concentrated primarily on the conditions of service ofofficers serving on permanent commissions in the general service, i.e., thej Executive, Technical, Supply and Administrative arms of the Services. these are the arms in which the great majority of openings are available for officers now serving on emergency commissions and which also offer the principalI openings  to  commissioned  rank  for  men   now  serving,   or  entered   infuture, in the ranks.   Further consideration is being given to the position ofthe Medical, Dental and Chaplains&apos; Services, and of officers employed on certain legal, educational and other special duties.   (A more detailed list ofvarious categories of officers falling outside the scope of the present paper is given in paragraph 65 below.)   The new rates of pay and allowances will apply also to ail officers serving on emergency commissions and to officersserving on short service or &quot; extended service &quot; commissions: the latter willin addition receive special gratuities on completing their short or extendedservice period.4. A summary of the decisions announced in this paper will be found inparagraph 71.RECRUITMENT AND CAREERS OF OFFICERSRoyal Navy.: 5. While there may be some change in the pre-war system of entry for&quot;officers of the Executive, Engineer*, and Supply and Secretariat Branchesof the Royal Navy, it is not expected that there will be any fundamentalalterations. The main source of supply of Naval officers for the ExecutiveBranch will continue to be the cadets entered through the Royal NavalCollege, Dartmouth, between the ages of 13 and 14. There will be a specialentry of cadets for the Executive, Engineer, Electrical and Supply andSecretariat Branches at about age 18, supplemented in some Branches by a smaller but appreciable intake through the universities at later ages. Therewill also be substantial opportunities for young men entered as ratings toobtain commissions in their early years.6. In the Executive, Engineer, Electrical, and Supply and Secretariat^Branches there will be, as hitherto, promotion by time up to the rank of[lieutenant, subject to&apos; certain adjustments of seniority according to theResults of the various qualifying examinations. Promotion to LieutenantCommander will be on a time basis. Promotion above the rank of LieutenantCommander will be by selection./ Conditions of service in the newly formed Electrical Branch will in general confer iiigith those of the Engineer Branch.48565 A a
y. The compulsory retiring ages for the various ranks will remain as atpresent.Army.8. While National Service continues, officers for the post-war RegularArmy will be provided from candidates who have served for a period in the ranks. The normal avenue of appointment to a regular commission will be after training at an Army College, though a proportion of candidates will beobtained by direct entry from the Universities and from the Auxiliary Forces.9. The normal age for entry to the Army College will be i8  to 19 years; \the course at the College will last for 18 months and will be designed to *give a general education with a definite military bias. No fees will be payable at the Army College, which the cadets will attend as enlisted soldiers.Candidates will be commissioned at the end of the Army College course,following which those accepted for the technical arms will be given a furtherprofessional training in science and engineering. Subject to vacancies andto the needs of the Army as a whole, the preferences expressed by cadetswill be studied in deciding to which corps or regiment a cadet will be com-missioned.10. Candidates for the Army College will normally be selected on the resultsof an Army Entrance Examination, comprising a written educational parttogether with tests of character and personality. Candidates who have passed the Higher School Certificate will normally be exempt from taking the writtenpart of the examination. In addition, a proportion of the vacancies at theArmy College will be allotted to specially selected candidates undergoingcompulsory Army service or serving on regular attestations; such candidateswill not be required to undergo the Army Entrance Examination, but willbe selected for their all-round qualities of leadership, subject to attaining a standard of general education enabling them to undertake the Army Collegecourse.ii. There will be promotion by time up to, and including, the rank of major as at present, but at an accelerated rate. Provided an officer attainsthe necessary standard of professional efficiency, promotion to the ranks of lieutenant, Captain and- Major will be after 2 years, 6 years and 13 yearsrespectively, instead of after 3, 8 and 17 years as before the war. promotion to Lieutenant-Colonel and higher ranks will be by selection.12. The ages at which officers will be required to retire will depend uponthe rank they attain and the arm to which they belong. A review is being undertaken of the present ages for compulsory retirement and it is possiblethat some of these may be reduced. It has, however, already been decidedthat in the arms in which the retirement age for those not promoted toLieutenant-Colonel is now 47 the age will be reduced to 45.Royal Air Force.13. As in the past, officers of the R.A.F. will be commissioned into oneor other of a number of Branches and it will be exceptional for an officer whohas been commissioned in one Branch to be transferred to another.   Certain Ichanges are, however, being made in the functions of these Branches ascompared with the pre-war position.14. Under the system introduced after the-1914-1918 war, flying and techni-cal posts and a large proportion of administrative posts were filled by officersof the -&quot;General Duties Branch; while the functions of the Equipment andAccountant Branches were limited to equipment and accounting duties. As aresult of developments immediately prior to and during the 1939-1945 war a technical Branch and an Administrative and Special Duties Branch have been
formed, to which many of the duties previously performed by officers of theGeneral Duties Branch have been transferred; while the responsibilities of the equipment and Accountant Branches have been considerably extended.Under the arrangements now approved, officers of the General Duties Branch,all of whom will have qualified on aircrew duties, will fill flying appointmentsand all command and administrative appointments which require flyingexperience. Provision will be made for a limited number of General Dutiesofficers to specialise on technical duties, and to be employed temporarily onsuch duties. . The Technical Branch will, however, be established on ajpermanent basis, and officers of this Branch will fill the great majority of technical posts, including the command of technical establishments landtechnical staff posts. A. considerable number of administrative posts,where flying experience is not a requisite, will be transferred to other branches. The duties of the Equipment and Accountant Branches willin consequence be extended. The title of the Accountant Branch will requirealteration, and for the present purpose &quot; Secretarial Branch &quot; will be used,although this is not final. The Administrative and Special Duties Branchwill not be retained, and the future of officers employed on various types ofspecial duty will be announced in due course.15. All Branches are now drawing to a considerable extent on officers whohave held emergency commissions during the war. For the future, theR.A.F. will draw partly on young men entered through the R.A.F. College,Cranwell, and other cadet training establishments which they will attend asserving airmen; partly on candidates who hold university degrees and technicaldiplomas; and partly, and to a far greater extent than before the war, onairmen selected from the ranks. The source of entry and the age of corn-missioning will vary to some extent with the Branch, but so long at least as national service is retained, officers of all these Branches will normally berequired to serve a period in the ranks. The R.A.F. College, Cranwell, willbe re-opened for the training of officers for the General Duties Branch.Entrants will be selected by a Central Selection Board from candidates of school certificate standard between the ages of 17^-19 who have qualified ata written examination and from aircraft apprentices recommended near theend of their course at a R.A.F. Apprentice School. Candidates undergoingtheir period of compulsory service will be eligible to enter for the entranceexamination and will be given facilities to enable them to1 do so. Successfulcandidates will be enlisted as airmen in the regrlar air force (if not alreadyso serving) and the payment of fees for the College course will be abolished.Officers will be employed on short service commissions in a number ofBranches, including the General Duties Branch, where short seivice corn-missions will be confined to aircrew entered under the arrangement set outin Command Paper 6715.16. Provision will be made for time promotion, subject to efficiency, up tothe rank of Flight Lieutenant in all Branches.   Thereafter promotion will beby selection to fill vacancies&apos; in the establishment.   The average ages of promotion will vary with the Branch and will in general be earlier in theGeneral Duties Branch than in the Technical Branch and earlier in theI Technical Branch than in the Equipment and Secretarial Branches.   The;ages of compulsory retirement will also vary with the Branch and will, inmost cases, be higher for the Technical, Equipment and Secretarial Branchesthan for the General Duties Branch.   Though provision will be made to enableall officers commissioned at the normal age to complete the periods required to qualify for the standard retired pay of their ranks, as set out in Appendix III,compulsory retiring ages will, in general, be lower than before the war.48565 A 3
GENERAL PAY SYSTEM17. For the reasons given in paragraph 6 of Command Paper 6715, it jsnecessary to retain for officers, as for other ranks, the present general systemof remuneration under which the officer is normally provided with accommoda-tion and rations in kind, in addition to his pay, and the married officerreceives allowances in respect of his family. The system of allowances will,however, be much simplified, and servant allowance, field allowance, fuel&apos;light and furniture allowances will be abolished or absorbed into pay, com-posite lodging allowance or marriage allowance (see paragraph 39 below), v.Broadly, the result will be that the unmarried officer will receive his pay ana Jwill be provided with furnished accommodation and rations in kind, or acomposite lodging allowance and ration allowance in lieu if provision in kind is not available. The married officer will receive his pay, marriage allowance and rations or ration allowance. (If the married officer occupies a. marriedquarter or official residence he will pay rent for it, and will also pay for fuel and light consumed.) A married officer who is separated from his family bythe exigencies of the Service will continue to be entitled to marriage allowance in respect of- his family and will in addition be entitled to accommodation and rations as a single officer, or to the composite lodging allowance andration allowance if single accommodation and rations are not available.18. Consideration is being given to the discontinuance of the extra pay atpresent issuable in respect of service at Admiralty, War Office and AirMinistry Headquarters and the substitution of a special rate of compositelodging allowance in recognition of the higher expenses of living in London.19. Officers will receive an outfit grant on first appointment, if not provided with outfit in kind.20. The main features of the present pay system in each of the three Servicesand of the changes which are now to be made are as follows:  Royal Navy21. The present scales of basic pay for the Executive, Engineer, Electricaland Supply and Secretariat Branches show considerable divergencies and the opportunities for drawing extra pay differ considerably, rank for rank, in theseBranches. Officers of equivalent rank in all Branches perform duties whichare of approximately the same value to the Navy, and the discrepancies in pay have upon occasion given rise to difficulty.22. In future, the Executive, Engineer, Electrical and Supply and Secre- ptariat Branches will have a common scale of basic pay.   The ages at whichcorresponding ranks in these Branches will be reached will necessarily differ.23. In the new code extra pay will be restricted to officers in command 1of sea-going ships and to flying and submarine officers* (see the notes at the jend of Table I in Appendix I).   The new scales of pay allow for the absorption Iof the average additional emoluments hitherto drawn in the form of extra pay of one kind and another.Army24. There are at present differential scales of pay between the variousArms. Officers, of the Cavalry (including Household Cavalry), Armoured jUnits, Royal Artillery, Royal Engineers, Royal Corps of Signals, Footguards jInfantry and Royal Army Service Corps have the same basic scales of pay ICorps pay is paid in addition to basic pay in the Royal Engineers, Royal  Corps of Signals and Royal Army Service Corps.     Officers of other Corps I* The question of Surveying Pay is under consideration.
nousuredudspay-.oyareceive special scales of pay.   Officers holding staff appointments receivestaff pay and there are also various forms of additional and speciar dutypay. Officers of the rank of General and Lieutenant General holding certaincommand appointments receive special &quot; in command &quot; rates of pay, and officers of lower rank holding certain command appointments receive com-mand pay. These special payments to officers in command are largely in recognition of the expenditure on entertainment that officers holding such appointments are required to incur.25. In future there will be a common scale of pay, on a simplified basis,for all Arms (subject to the reservation as regards special Branches in para-graph 3 above) .*   Staff pay, Corps pay and other forms of additional pay(except parachute pay and flying pay) will be abolished.     A system otqualification pay will, however, be introduced for officers of the rank of major and below with not less than two years&apos; commissioned service.   Qualifi-cation pay will not be granted for the qualities or degree of knowledge requiredby an officer to carry out the normal duties of his Corps, but for militaryand technical qualifications obtained by a proportion of specially qualifiedofficers, e.g., officers who have qualified at the Staff College or possess a[ university honours degree in a subject of value to the Army.   QualificationI pay will be drawn continuous^- irrespective of the duties on which the officerI is employed.  It will be on a single scale for all Arms, at the following rates:  A day.Lieutenant        ............      2s. 6d.Captain   ...     ...     ...      ...      ...     4s. od.Major     .........      ......      5s. od.26. Command pay and the special &quot; in command &quot; rates for General officers will be abolished, provision being made for an officers necessary entertainingI expenses by the grant of allowances for official entertainment (seej Appendix IV).I Royal Air ForceI   27. There are at present differential scales of pay for the various Branches,1 and in general the rates are on an inclusive basis, i.e. without additional pay.I The&quot; inclusive basis will be retained, but except in the ranks of Pilot officer and Flying Officer, where the pay of the General Duties Branch will be higher1 than that of the other Branches, the same rates of pay will apply in the general Duties, Technical, Equipment and Secretarial Branches (though, as statedgin paragraph 16, the ages at which the various ranks will be reached willjvary with the Branch). Provision will be made for officers of Branches otherdthan the General Duties Branch actually employed on flying duties to draw&quot;flying pay at the rate of 3s. a day in the ranks of Pilot Officer and Flying^Officer.RATES OF PAY28. The existing rates of basic pay* are considered to require amendmentpn the light of current conditions and the requirements of the peace-time forces,phe changes which are to be made are designed not only to simplify thepresent pay system and remove the present anomalies between, and within,She three Services, but also to effect a general improvement, over the career1 * The arrangements to be applied to the Royal Army Medical Corps, Army DentalC)rPs&apos; Royal Army Veterinary Corps, Royal Army Chaplains Department, ArmyEducational Corps and Army Catering Corps, and certain officers employed on legal duties,fre under consideration.48565 a 4
as a whole, as compared with pre-war rates.* The scales of pay (and therates of marriage allowance) have been framed on the basis that the officer&apos;sremuneration will be sufficient without supplement from private means.The existing rates for junior officers on first appointment at age 20 or 21and in their early years, are generous for men of these ages, and are not thought to require any considerable alteration. A more substantial increasein pay is thought to be justified at about age 26 when the officer may reasonably (see paragraph 35 below) be contemplating marriage. Furtherappreciable increases are authorised in general in the higher ranks havimregard to the increasing family commitments which the officer will have z\these stages, to the increased responsibilities which he will be called upon tocarry, and to the general trend of professional salaries at these levels under present conditions.29. The new pay scales provide in all three Services for biennial incrementsof pay in all ranks up to and including Captain, R.N., Colonel and GroupCaptain.30. In framing the new rates of pay account has been taken of the new system and rates of marriage allowance (see paragraphs 34 to 37 below),which involve a number of adjustments as compared with the allowancesdrawn by married officers under the pre-war systems. Marriage allowance(and also the composite lodging allowance for single officers, and for marriedofficers not living with their families) will be treated as taxable income ofthe officer (see paragraphs 43 and 44 below).31. The new pay scales for the three Services have been constructed onthe broad principle that emoluments should not only be adequate for theduties and responsibilities borne, but should take account of the ages at whichthe various ranks are normally reached. The rates of pay in the three services are, therefore, not necessarily identical rank for rank, though thereis a broad equivalence, age for age.32. In all three Services pay will be issuable monthly in arrear.33. Tables I-III in Appendix I give the revised rates of basic pay forcommissioned officers of the Royal Navy, Army and R.A.F., up to the ranks of Captain, R.N., Brigadier and Air Commodore, with an indication in termsof age and service of the stages at which the various rates may be expectedto be attained. Table IV gives the rates for Rear Admirals, Major Generalsand Air Vice Marshals and higher ranks, these rates being flat rates for eachrank, common to all three Services.ALLOWANCESMarriage Allowance34. As stated in Command Paper 6715 (paragraph 22) the present schemeof family allowances for other ranks, which provides for a substantial additionto the allowance in respect of each child, is unsatisfactory, and a system isto be instituted under which the rates of marriage allowance will not vary according to the size of the family. . The same considerations apply in thecase of officers, and it has accordingly been decided to institute for officer:also a system of marriage allowance under which the rates of allowance will vary only according to the rank of the officer and not according to the size of the family.   The new arrangement will avoid the present disparities between* i.e., excluding the War Service Increments which are at present in issue in addition to basic rates.
one married officer and another ot the same rank and performing the sameduties. The full rate of marriage allowance will be payable (subject to paragraph 35) on marriage and will continue (with changes for rank only)throughout married life whether there are children or not, and after the timewhen any children have passed beyond the existing limiting ages for children&apos;allowances.35. The qualifying age for officers&apos; marriage allowance will be reduced fromthe pre-war limit of 30 to 26.* This lower age-point appears to be reasonably^/eil in harmony with the normal ages of marriage for young men in other professions, and will still enable the Services to expect from the young officer in his first five years or so that freedom from family commitments which iavery desirable in the Services at the beginning of an officers career. [Officerscommissioned from the ranks before age 26 who may be recognized as marriedunder the rules applicable to other ranks will be allowed to retain the marriage allowance to which they are already entitled until they become qualified forthe officer&apos;3 rate of allowance at age 26.] [Special arrangements will be made[or certain categories of officers, e.g. officers commissioned from the ranks,who may be married before age 26.]36. Family allowances will be payable under the provisions of the family allowances Act in respect of the second and subsequent children of officers.These allowances will be extended under special Service arrangements tocover the children of officers and other ranks living with their father at his duty station abroad.37. The rates of marriage allowance under the new scheme will be: Officers aged 26 and overLieutenant Commander, Major and Squadron Leader;and lower commissioned ranksCaptain R.N.t, Colonel, and Group Captain; Com-mander R.N.,  Lieut.  Colonel and Wing Com-mander ......Brigadier and Air Commodore ...Rear Admiral, Major General and Air Vice Marshal;and officers of higher rank ...       ......A day.s. d.12 615 017 620 o38. The tables in Appendix II set out the total remuneration of marriedofficers (exclusive of rations or ration allowance and any other allowancessuch as are mentioned in paragraphs 39 and 40 below).Other allowances39. There is much diversity between the Services at present in regard to therates of allowances granted in lieu of provision in kind and in the conditions* This minimum age limit for the grant of marriage allowance will not apply to an officer who on 30th June, 1946, is in receipt of an allowance in respect of his family at the ratesfor officers commissioned on or after 1st January, 1942 (or is under any other system of marriage allowance providing for specific children&apos;s additions) provided that his service on the active list continues without a break. Such officers will, exceptionally, be allowedto receive marriage allowance at the new rates or under paragraph 66 (ii).t There is in the Royal Navy no substantive rank corresponding to that of Brigadierand Air Commodore. Captains R.N. with six or more years service as such will thereforebe eligible for the higher rate of marriage allowance for Brigadiers and Air Commodores
governing these allowances. In future there will be a uniform system of suchallowances applicable to all three Services where the circumstances are thesame. The number of separate allowances will also be reduced. The chiefchanges will be that:(i) The separate lodging, and fuel and light, allowances for single officersnow issuable in the Army and R.A.F. will be consolidated into a compositelodging allowance, similar to the Naval lodging allowance.(ii) This composite lodging allowance will absorb the servant allowance^now issuable in certain circumstances in all three Services.(iii) Provision allowance (Royal Navy) and ration allowance (Armyand R.A.F.) will be on the same scales in all three Services, and the numberof different rates will be reduced.40. Allowances such as Dominion or Colonial Allowance which are granted in respect of extra expense in certain circumstances will in general be con-tinued. Field Allowance will be abolished in due course, though no change will be made before the 1st July, 1946. Similarly Mediterranean allowance and Far East Allowance, which are not related to ascertainable extra expenses,will be withdrawn and replaced by such Dominion or Colonial Allowance asmay be found to be required, but not before the 1st July, 1946.41. War service grants (including emergency grants) are war-time emolu-ments deriving from the introduction of compulsory military service. Theywill not form part of the permanent post-war code for officers and will bedealt with as set out in paragraph 29 of Command Paper 6715.Taxation of Allowances42. Owing to divergencies of practice and to the operation of various extra-statutory concessions, there have in the past been inequalities between thethree Services in regard to the incidence of taxation on married officers&apos;allowances and other allowances. During the war (see sub-paragraph (v)on page 4 of Command Paper 6559), pending a review of the taxation posi-tion of all allowances paid to members of the forces, marriage allowances,lodging allowances, family allowances and allowances in respect of childrenhave in general been exempted from tax.43. It is anomalous that an appreciable proportion of the emoluments olService personnel should, contrary to normal practice, be free from tax.To this extent, Service personnel do not share in the gains or losses due tothe decreases or increases in Income Tax which affect the rest of the com-munity, and comparison between the earnings of one rank and another, or between Service earnings and civilian salaries, is impaired.44. It was stated in paragraph 27 of Command Paper 6715 that the marriage allowance of other ranks would be treated as taxable income, since it is in effect an addition to the pay of the married man. This decision wilapply to officers&apos; marriage allowance equally with the marriage allowance of other ranks. It will also apply to the composite lodging allowance, absorbingseparate lodging, fuel and light and servant allowances (see paragraph 35above), which will be treated as taxable income of an officer on the lodginglist.* I* The decision to treat the composite lodging allowance as taxable income in all casesTrill apply also in the (comparatively rare) cases of other ranks on the lodging list.
45- In view of the special position of the Services in regard to rations,legislation will be introduced to exempt officers and men from tax on Navalprovision allowance (and grog money) and Army and Royal Air Force ration allowance. This exemption will cover also the various cash issues which maybe made to messes in lieu, or in supplementation, of provisions in kind.Dominion or Colonial Allowance will remain exempt from tax under Section 18-of the Finance Act, 1943. Allowances for official entertainment (see para-graph 26 above) will also not be liable to tax.46. It is appreciated that the decisions in paragraph 44 will have a consider-able effect on the net receipts of Service personnel. The result, however, is tobring Service remuneration on to a more rational basis, compared with thatof other members of the community. Special regard has moreover been givento these decisions as one of the factors in determining the new schemes ofService emoluments.National Insurance47. Subjecc to necessary modifications, the Service officer and his familywill be eligible for the full range of benefits of the National Insurance Scheme,or broadly equivalent benefits (e.g. medical attention) under Service arrange-ments. The arrangements for the insurance of officers will be based on thesame general principles as the arrangements to be laid down for other ranks(see paragraph 30 of Command Paper 6715). The intention is to prescribe forthe officer an appropriate rate of contribution to be paid during service inrespect of the insurance benefits which he or his family will receive duringor after his service.RETIREMENT BENEFITS48. The present arrangements for retired pay and gratuities are complicated and involve many differences both in rates and conditions of entitlement,not only between one Service and another, but also between branches withinthe same Service.49. It has been decided to introduce a new and simplified code of retired pay and gratuities which will be common to all three Services. Moreover,!he rates of retired pay provided under the new code will in general be substantially more favourable than the maximum rates attainable underthe present code.50. Details of the revised scheme will be found in Appendix III. Thefollowing paragraphs, which must be read in conjunction with Appendix 111,are a broad and non-technical summary of its main features.51. In many branches of the armed forces, officers not selected for promoting-tion to the higher ranks have to retire at relatively early ages and retired pay is designed to provide a measure of compensation for such prematuretermination of career.52. This has been borne in mind in framing the new scheme, of whichIthe essential feature is a series of standard rates of retired pay which willI be granted to officers compulsorily retired because they have not been selectedjfor further promotion, or because no further employment is available for[them, subject to the completion of a prescribed period of service for eachfrank including not less than two years&apos; service in that rank. (For officers[of the rank cf Admiral, General or Air Chief Marshal, the minimum period[of service in the rank will be.only one year.)
53- The minimum periods of total service required for the full standard rate are as follows:  Minimum service fromage   21   required   to qualify   for   the   fullStandard rate appropriate to the rank of standard rateLieutenant, R.N., Captain or Flight Lieutenant 20 yearsLieutenant   Commander,   Major   or   SquadronLeader      ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 22 yearsCommander, R.N., Lieutenant Colonel or wing commander        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 24 yearsColonel or Group Captain ...      ...      ...      ... 26 yearsCaptain, R.N., Brigadier or Air Commodore ... 28 yearsRear Admiral, Major General or Air Vice Marshal,and higher ranks ...       ...       ...       ...       ... 30 years54. Certain deductions will be made from the full standard rates in cases in which an officer on compulsory retirement has not completed sufficientservice to qualify for the full standard rate.55. The standard rates of retired pay (which will be the maximum rates)will be the same for all officers of equal rank, irrespective of the branch or service* to which they belong. The ages at which officers of the same rankwill be compulsorily retired, however, will differ, especially between onebranch and another. It will thus be possible in future for an officer to receive,on compulsory retirement, the same rate of retired pay as another of the samerank who has completed a longer period of service. The principle under-lying this provision is that the officer who is compulsorily retired after a relatively short period of service has suffered a greater curtailment of hiscareer than an officer who continues in the Service for a longer period.56. The grant of retired pay will normally be conditional on the completionof 20 years&apos; service. But provision will be made for this period to be reduced in cases of compulsory retirement to not less than 15 years where, in theinterests of the Service, officers are entered at ages above the normal.57. For officers permitted to retire at their own request the question ofcompensation for loss of career does not arise. The retired pay of such officers will therefore be reduced as provided in Appendix III, Paragraph 10.These reductions will not, however, be applied to officers who retire at theirown request within two years of the compulsory retiring age prescribed fortheir rank.58. Gratuities will be paid to officers who on retirement have not servedlong enough to qualify for the grant of retired pay, provided that they have completed not less than ten years&apos; service.59. Retired officers will, as hitherto, be liable to recall for service in emergency.60. The new rates of retired pay have been fixed in the light of currentconditions and will not be subject to increase under the Service Instrumentscorresponding to the Pensions Increase Act, 1944.61. The new rates of retired pay will fall to be adjusted in conformitywith any general decision that may be given regarding State pensioners asa whole, when retirement pensions under the National Insurance Scheme(see paragraph 47 above) become issuable concurrently with them.* See, however, paragraph 65 with regard to certain categories of officers whose positionis still under consideration.
-    179Leave on retirement62. The various differing provisions hitherto in operation relating to thegrant of leave on retirement have been reviewed and simplified. Subjectto the special arrangements applicable during the currency of the presentrelease scheme, officers retired in the normal course in future will be granted a period of 28 days&apos; leave with full pay.Resettlement63. It is recognised that officers returning to civil life on completion of aperiod of short or extended service or on retirement at a relatively earlyage may need help in obtaining suitable civilian employment. consideration is being given, in the light of pre-war experience, and the experience whichis now being gained by the Appointments Department of the Ministry ofLabour and National Service, to the special steps which might be taken toassist in the resettlement of such officers.TREATMENT OF SPECIAL WAR EMOLUMENTS64. Officers* will be treated in the same way as other ranks in regard tocertain special war-time emoluments which will not form part of the post-warcode, viz.: (i) War GratuityService will continue to reckon as war service for the purposes ofthe gratuity up to the anniversary of VJ-Day, i.e., the 15th August,1946.(ii) War Service IncrementsService will cease to count for the purpose of War Service Incrementsfrom the 1st July, 1946, and after that date no further increments willbe granted. Special steps will be taken for dealing with individual cases where rates of pay, plus War Service Increments, are being drawnat amounts in excess of the new rates of pay to be introduced on the1st July, 1946 (see paragraph 66 (i) below).(iii) Japanese Campaign PayJapanese Campaign Pay will be reviewed in the light of circum-stances, but will not be withdrawn before the anniversary of VJnDay,i.e., the 15th August, 1946.CLASSES OF OFFICERS REMAINING TO BE DEALT WITH65. As stated in paragraph 3 above, the arrangements set out in this papercover the main classes of commissioned officers of the Royal Navy, Army and royal Air Force. The position of certain specialist categories is reservedfor further consideration. These categories include the Medical and DentalServices, Chaplains, and officers employed on certain legal, educational, andother special duties. Separate consideration will be given to officers of theRoyal Marines and to Warrant Officers and officers ex-Warrant rank of theRoyal Navy. Certain special provisions will also be necessary to cover theposition of men commissioned from the ranks at relatively late ages or for limited duties, e.g., as Quartermasters in the Army. Consideration is also being given to the position, so far as concerns non-effective benefits, of officers who have been appointed to war-time temporary commissions while serving in the ranks, on regular normal engagements.   The position of British Service* Including the categories of officers mentioned in paragraph 65.
Army and R.A.F. officers on Indian rates of pay is being examined by HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the U.K. and the Government of India. Officersof the Nursing and Women&apos;s Services, and officers of all Services recruitedoverseas are not covered by this Paper.APPLICATION OF NEW CODEPay and marriage allowance66. The new rates and conditions of pay and marriage allowance will apply to all officers whether serving on regular or non-regular engagements(unless they have already proceeded on release leave pending demobilisation)on the ist July, 1946. They will also apply to all officers who are corn-missioned on or after that date. There will, however, be special arrangements in those cases where officers who have been commissioned before the ist July,1946, are drawing rates of pay and marriage allowance under the old codewhich exceed the rates payable under the new code.(i) PayWhere rates of pay, plus War Service Increments, are being drawn on the 30th June, 1946, at such amounts as to produce an excess over thenew rates of pay, the difference will be continued temporarily as an additionto the rate of pay provided in the new code, and will be regarded as a &quot; warexcess &quot;. This &quot; war excess &quot; will be paid, on a reducing scale, in additionto the rate of pay to which the officer is entitled under the new code onthe ist July, 1946, so long as the officer continues to serve in the rank heldon the 30th June, 1946, or in any lower rank.* Should the officer be promoted to a higher rank his &quot; war excess &quot; will be re-assessed and onlythe excess, if any, of the rate of pay (plus War Service Increments) of whichhe was in receipt on the 30th June, 1946, over the new rate of the rank towhich he is promoted will be regarded as a &quot; war excess &quot;. In determining the amount of a &quot; war excess &quot; any extra remuneration of which an officerwas in receipt on the 30th June, 1946, in respect of an appointment (e.g.,Army Adjutant) or specialist qualification (e.g. Naval Gunnery Officer) heldon that date, will be taken into account, with the exceptions:(a) that extra pay in respect of service at Admiralty, War Office andAir Ministry Headquarters is under consideration (see paragraph 18); and(b) that only half of any command pay drawn by an Army LieutenantColonel will count for this purpose.!The &quot; war excess &quot; assessed in accordance with these arrangements will bereduced by instalments, beginning on the ist January, 1947, and continuingat half-yearly intervals thereafter until the whole of the &quot; war excess &quot; iswithdrawn. The initial reduction will be at the rate of is. a day, and each subsequent reduction will be at the rate of 2s. a day, or such smaller amount as will suffice to absorb the &quot; war excess &quot;.(ii) Marriage Allowance&quot; War excesses &quot; in respect of marriage allowance will not be granted toofficers if they are in receipt of allowances in respect of their families at rates which include no specific additions for children. Where the allowance includes a specific addition for children and the rate of payment on the 30th June,* Increments of pay in respect (.f length of service which may subsequently become dueunder the new code will not affect the &quot;war excess &quot;.f Because the new rate of pay for Lieutenant Colonels includes that part of commandpay under the existing code which is regarded as given in respect of the responsibility of command.
-    180i940&apos; is higher than the rate of marriage allowance payable under the newcode, the difference will be continued temporarily* as an addition to the newrate of-marriage allowance and regarded as a &quot; war excess &quot;. The amountso continued in issue will not be subject to subsequent increase under theprovisions of the old code, except in respect of any children for whom pre-natal allowance may be admissible before the ist July, 1946. The &quot; warexcess &quot; will be reduced by instalments, beginning on the ist January, 1947,and continuing at half-yearly intervals thereafter, until the whole of the&quot; war excess &quot; is withdrawn. The initial reduction will be at the rate of is.a day and each subsequent reduction will be at the rate of 2s. a day or a smaller amount as will suffice to absorb the &quot; war excess &quot;. The &quot; warexcess &quot; will be treated for tax purposes in the same way as the marriage allowance itself (see paragraph 44 above).These special arrangements for pay and marriage allowance will not applyto officers granted regular commissions after the date of publication of this paper, unless they are serving in the forces on that date and their service on the active list continues without a break.Retired Pay67. The new scheme of retired pay will come into operation immediately and will apply to all officers granted permanent commissions after the dateof publication of this Paper. It will also apply to permanent commissioned officers who were serving on the active list on the date of publication of command Paper 6715 (the 19th December, 1945), or who have been grantedpermanent commissions since the 19th December, 1945: except that, if itis to their advantage, officers serving on the active list on the date of publication of this Paper will be allowed to receive, in respect of the rankthen held, the retired pay or gratuity terms prescribed under the old schemeinstead of those prescribed under the new scheme. The new scheme willnot apply to officers who were already on the retired list on the 19thDecember, 1945. Consideration is being given, however, to the positionof retired officers who have given full-time service in the armed forces inthe 1939-1945 war.Gratuities68. The revised scale of gratuities set out in Appendix III will applyto all officers appointed to permanent commissions after the date of publi-cation of this Paper. It will also apply to officers holding permanent commisions on the active list on the date of publication of this Paper,subject to the following conditions:  Only service rendered subsequent to the date of publication of this paper will earn gratuity at the rates provided in the new scheme, but in determining the scale on which gratuity is earned under the new scheme,all unbroken service rendered before the date of this announcement willbe taken into account.Thus for an Army officer allowed to retire one year after the date of publication of this Paper on completion of a total of 12 years&apos; service, thegratuity payable will be  1,250, (i.e., 11 years&apos; service at  100 a year (oldrate), plus one year at the new rate of  150 a year for service in excess of10 years).* Subject to reassessment in the event of a higher rate of marriage allowance becomingpayable under the new code before the &quot; war excess &quot; is liquidated.
PROVISION FOR FUTURE REVISION69. The new codes of pay, allowances and retired pay wdl not be subjectto automatic revision, e.g., by reference to the cost of living index or otherset formula.   As in the case of the codes for other ranks, however:  (i) The rates of pay and marriage allowance will be subject to reviewfrom time to time, though changes will not be made except in the eventof a marked alteration in conditions. Any such changes in rates whichmay be made in course of time will apply without exception to all officersthen serving, and there will be no arrangements for granting reservedrights on a permanent basis to individuals to whom the rates and con-ditions at the time may be more favourable.(ii) Allowances granted in lieu of provision in kind will continue tobe reviewed periodically, as at present, though minor changes in con-ditions will not be reflected in an alteration of the rates.(iii) There will be no regular provision for the revision of retired pay-ESTIMATED COST OF NEW CODES(i) Pay and marriage allowance70. The estimated annual cost of the new rates of officers&apos; pay andmarriage allowance, as compared with the pre-war rates, on the basis ofthe 1938 strengths of officers in the three Services (excluding India) is shown by the following table: 	(a) Officers&apos; Strength 1938	(b) Cost of 1938 Rates	W Cost of New Rates	Increase of (c) over (b)	Percentage Increase of (c) over (b)Navy ...

Japanese CampaignPay, and other emoluments related to local and other special conditions, are excluded.
v -    181It must, however, be pointed out that while these tables illustrate to someextent the broad effect of the new code on each Service they do not enableaccurate conclusions to be drawn either as to the actual cost of peace-timeofficer strengths or as to the relative advantages which the new code willconfer on any one Service as compared with the others.(ii) Retired PayThe estimated cost of the new retired pay scheme, as compared with thecurrent rates on the basis of the 1938 officer numbers, is shown in thefollowing table: 	Present rates		New rates	Without Pension Increase	With Pension Increase	Navy Army R.A.F.......

(i) There has been a review of the pay codes for officers serving inthe general service, i.e., the Executive, Technical, Supply and AdministrativeArms of the Services. The new codes will result in a broad equality oftreatment between officers of the three Services, and the present disparitiesbetween the Services and within each Service will be removed. (Paragraphs1-3).Recruitment and careers(ii) There will be certain changes, particularly in the Army and RoyalAir Force, in the methods of recruitment 0&apos; permanent officers. In all three services there will be opportunities for obtaining commissions from the ranks,and, at least while national service is retained, other rank service will be a necessary antecedent to entry to the Army and R.A.F. Colleges, which thecadets will attend as enlisted soldiers and airmen.   (Paragraphs 5, 8, 9, 15.)
(iii) There will be promotion by time up to and including the ranks of lieutenant Commander, Major and Flight Lieutenant. In the Army pro-motion to the ranks up to and including Major will be at an accelerated rate.(Paragraphs 6, n and 16.)PayThe single officer will normally be provided, in addition to pay, widiaccommodation and rations in kind and the married officer will normallyreceive pay, marriage allowance and rations or radon allowance.(Paragraph 17.)(v) Officers will receive an outfit grant on first appointment,  if not provided with outfit in kind.   (Paragraph 19.)(vi) The main changes in the pay systems will be as follows:  (a) Royal Navy.

(Paragraphs 22 and 23.)(b) Army. There will be a common scale of pay, on a simplifiedbasis, for all Arms other than those specified in the footnote to para-graph 25. Staff pay, Corps pay and other forms of additional pay(except parachute pay and flying pay) will be abolished. A system ofqualification pay on a single scale for all Arms will be introduced for officers of the rank of Major and below with not less than two years&apos;commissioned service. Command pay and &quot; in command &quot; rates of pay for General Officers will be abolished, provision being made forallowances for official entertainment.   (Paragraphs 25 and 26.)(c) Royal Air Force. Except in the ranks of Pilot Officer and FlyingOfficer, where the pay of the General Duties Branch will be higher thanthat of other Branches, ihe same inclusive rates of pay will apply in theGeneral Duties, Technical, Equipment and Secretarial Branches. Officersof Branches other than the General Duties Branch actually employed onflying duties will draw flying pay at the rate of 3s. a day in the ranks ofPilot Officer and Flying Officer.(vii) The new rates of pay are designed not only to simplify the presentpay system and remove the present anomalies between and within the three services, but also to effect a general improvement, over the career as a whole,as compared with pre-war rates (i.e., excluding the present War ServiceIncrements). There is no considerable change in the rates for junior officersin their early years, but there is provision for a more substantial increase at about age 26 (when marriage will be recognized), with further increases, ingeneral, in the higher ranks.   (Paragraph 28.)(viii) The new pay scales provide in all three Services for biennial incre-ments of pay up to and including the ranks of Captain R.N., Colonel andGroup Captain.   (Paragraph 29.)(ix) The new pay scales for the three Services take account of the agesat which the various ranks are normally reached.   (Paragraph 31.)(x) The new pay scales are set out in detail in the tables I-IVin Appendix I.Marriage Allowance(xi) The new marriage allowance system, which will apply uniformly to thethree Services, will provide for variations only according to the rank of theofficer and not according to the size of the family.   (Paragraph 34.)
(xii) The qualifying age for officers&apos; marriage allowance will be reduced from the pre-war limit of 30 to 26. There will be special arrangements for[officers commissioned from the ranks] [certain categories of officers, e.g.,officers commissioned from the ranks] who may be married before age 26.(Paragraph 35.)(xiii) Family allowances will be payable under the provisions of the family allowances Act in respect of the second and subsequent children of officers.(Paragraph 36.)(xiv) The rates of marriage allowance are set out in detail in paragraph 37,and the total remuneration of married officers (exclusive of rations and ration,etc., allowances) is given in the tables in Appendix II.Other Allowances(xv) There will be a simplified system of allowances in place of the variousallowances which may now be granted in lieu of provision in kind (rations,accommodation, etc).   (Paragraph 39.)(xvi) Dominion or Colonial Allowance will be continued. Field allowance will be abolished in due course, and Mediterranean and Far East allowanceswill be replaced by such Dominion or Colonial Allowance as may be required;but these changes will not take place before the ist July, 1946. (Para-graph 40.)(xvii) War service grants (including emergency grants) will not form partof the post-war code for officers and will be dealt with as set out in para-graph 29 of Command Paper 6715.   (Paragraph 41.)Taxation of Allowances(xviii) Marriage allowance and composite lodging allowance (which willabsonb fuel and light, furniture and servant allowances) will be treated astaxable income of the officer. Legislation will be introduced to exemptprovision and ration allowances from tax.    (Paragraphs 44 and 45.)(xix) Dominion or Colonial Allowance, and allowances for official enter-tainment, will not be liable to tax.    (Paragraph 45.)National Insurance(xx) Subject to necessary modifications, the Service officer and his familywill be eligible for the full range of benefits of the National Insurance Scheme,or broadly equivalent benefits (e.g., medical attention) under Service arrange-ments. The insurance system for officers will be based on the same general principles as the arrangements to be laid down for other ranks. (Para-graph 47.)Retired Pay and Gratuities(xxi) There will be a new and simplified scheme of retired pay and gratuitieswhich will be common to all three Services. The rates of retired pay will, ingeneral, be substantially more favourable than the maximum rates under thepresent code.   (Paragraphs 48 and 49.)(xxii) The detailed rates and conditions of the new scheme are set out inAppendix III.(xxiii) Subject to the special arrangements applicable during the currency of the present release scheme, officers retired in the normal course in future will receive 28 days&apos; leave with full pay.   (Paragraph 62.)
Treatment of Special War Emoluments(xxiv) Service will continue to reckon for war gratuity up to the anniversary of VJ-Day, i.e., the 15th August&quot; 1946.   (Paragraph 64 (i).)(xxv) Service will cease to count for the purpose of War Service Incrementsfrom the ist July, 1946.   (Paragraph 64 (ii).)(xxvi) Japanese Campaign Pay will be reviewed in the light of circum-stances, but will not be withdrawn before the anniversary of VJ-Day, i.e.,the 15th August, 1946.

(Paragraph 66 (i).)(xxix) There will similarly be special arrangements for officers who aredrawing marriage allowance, under any code making provision for specificadditions in respect 01 children, at rates higher than the rates payable underthe new code.   (Paragraph 66 (ii).)(xxx) The new scheme of retired pay will come into operation immediately and will apply to all officers granted permanent commissions after the dateof publication of this Paper. Subject to certain reservations in favour ofofficers serving on the date of publication of this Paper, it will also apply to permanent commissioned officers who were serving on the activelist on the date of publication of Command Paper 6715 (the 19th December,1945), or who have been granted permanent commissions since the 19thDecember, 1945. It will not apply to officers already on the retired liston the 19th December, 1945, but consideration is being given to the positionof retired officers who have given full-time service in the Armed Forces inthe 1939-1945 war.

Revised scheme of Service retired pay and gratuities for permanent commissioned officers of the Royal Navy, Army and R.A.F., other than the special categories setout in paragraph 65.RETIRED PAYRatesi. The standard rates will be as follows:  Lieutenant R.N., Captain or Flight Lieutenant      ...       ...  375 a yearLieutenant Commander, Major or Squadron Leader ... ^475 a yearCommander, R.N., Lieutenant Colonel or Wing Commander /025 a yearCaptain R.N., with less than 6 years&apos; Service in the rank,Colonel or Group Captain    ...       ...       ...       ...       ... ^825 a yearCaptain R.N., after 6 years&apos; service in the rank, Brigadier or air Commodore ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...  900 a yearRear Admiral, Major General or Air Vice Marshal   ...       ...       ^1,100 a yearVice Admiral, Lieutenant General or Air Marshal   ...       ...        1,^00 a yearAdmiral, General or Air Chief Marshal        ...       ...       ...       , 1,500 a yearHalf Pay.Admiral of the Fleet, Field Marshal or Marshal of the RoyalAir Force ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...       ...      ^1,800 a yearCONDITIONS OF AWARD OF RETIRED pay general conditions2. The grant of retired pay to officers retired otherwise than as invalids, will normally be conditional upon completion of 20 years&apos; service but where in special cases,in the interests of the Service, officers are entered at ages above that of the normalentrant, retired pay may be granted on compulsory retirement after not less than   5 years&apos; service.3. For invalided officers retired pay will be admissible provided that not less than10 years&apos; service- has been given.Compulsory retirement4. Subject to the conditions in sub-paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 below, retired pay at thestandard rate appropriate to his rank (as set out above) will be granted to an officercompulsorily retired: (a) on attaining the age limit for service in his rank in the branch of theService to which he belongs,&apos; or(/;) before attaining that age limit, it having been decided that he will not befurther promoted, that there is no further employment available for him.5. The award of the full standard rate of retired pay of the rank in which an officer is serving at the time of retirement will be conditional upon the completion of aminimum period of service, as set out in paragraph 6 below, including a prescribedpsriod of full pay active list service in the rank in question.* For an officer of the rank of Admiral, General, or Air Chief Marshal, the prescribed period of service in the rankwill be one year. For officers of lower ranks, two years&apos; service in the rank will berequired. Where an officer (other than an invalid) has completed less than the requisiteminimum period of service in the rank, the rate of retired pay will be as for the nextlower rank.6. The minimum periods of total service required for the award of the full standard rate of retired pay will be as follows: Minimum service afterage 21 requiredStandard rate appropriate to the rank of to qualify for thefull standard rate.Lieutenant R.N., Captain or Flight Lieutenant R.A.F.    ... 20 yearsLieutenant Commander, Major or Squadron Leader   ...       ... 22 yearsCommander, R.N., Lieutenant Colonel or Wing Commander 24 yearsColonel or Group Captain ...       ... .       ...       ... 26 yearsCaptain, R.N., Brigadier or Air Commodore   ...       ...       ... 28 yearsRear Admiral, Major General or Air Vice Marshal, or above 30 years* The requirement of a prescribed period of service in the rank will bo dispensed withfor officers who are invalided from the Service.
7. Where the total service given is less than the period, according to rank, pJLsSirBdin paragraph 6, the rate of retired pay otherwise admissible will be reduced by onededuction, at the following rates, in respect of each year or part of a year of the deficiency:  Rate of retired pay* Deduction^ for each year or part of a year by whichthe total service falls short of the period specified inparagraph 6.Above  1,000 a year    ...      ...      ...      ...      ...  50 a year 1,000 and above  600 a year 600 and above  400 a year 400 and above  300 a year 300 and above  200 a year 200 and below 30 a year 20 a year 15 a year 10 a year 5. a yearS. The scheme outlined in paragraphs 2-7 above does not apply to officers retiredotherwise than in the normal course, e.g., on invaliding or for nnsuitability, inefficiencyor misconduct, or who are cashiered or dismissed. The position of such officers isunder consideration.Retirement at own request9. Officers who are allowed to retire at their own request, within two years beforethe date on which they attain the compulsorily retiring age for their rank and branch,will receive the rate of retired pay that would have been payable on compulsoryretirement in the circumstances set out in paragraph 4 above.10. The rate of retired pay payable to an officer who k permitted to retire at hisown,request, except as provided in paragraph 9, will be the rate which he would havereceived on compulsory retirement at the age-limit for service in his rank and branchreduced by one deduction on the scale shown in paragraph 7 above for each year or part of a year by which his age falls short, by more than two years, of that age-limit,with a further deduction of 10 per cent, of the resultant figure.Gratuities11. Gratuities at the following rates will be payable to officers holding permanent commisions who on retirement have completed insufficient service to qualify for thegrant of retired pay: On completion of not less than 10 years&apos; service   ...       ...       ...       1,000For each complete year of service in excess of 10 years a further 150.The maximum total gratuity payable will be  2,350.Where an officer is permitted to leave the service, except on invaliding, after lessthan 10 years&apos; service, no gratuity will be payable.Reckoning of Service12. For the purpose of the grant or the assessment of retired pay or gratuity underthe new scheme,  service will reckon as follows: (a) Full pay service on the active list subsequent to the date of appointment toa commission will count subject to the normal rules &quot;towards the periods ofservice required (as specified in paragraphs 2 and 3 above) to qualify for the award of retired pay, or for gratuity (paragraph 11) and also for the assessment of therate of gratuity.(b) For the purpose of assessment of the rate of retired pay however (see paragraphs 1, 6 and 7) only service (as defined in sub-para, (a) above) subsequent to the date of attaining the age of 21 years will reckon.13. Full pay service after the age of 18 in ranks below commissioned rank will alsoreckon as follows: Service as a subordinate officer,   R.N., Warrant Officer R.N.,Army Warrant Officer Class I, or Warrant Officer R.A.F.      ...       In full* Where, after a deduction has been made, the net remaining rate of retired pay is less than the minimum appropriate to that rate of deduction, any further deductionswill be at the next lower rate. For example, if the standard rate of retired pay is  625 a year but under the above conditions three deductions are to be made, the firstdeduction would be at  30 a year, and the next two at  20 a year each; thus the netrate of retired pay would be  555 a year.
Service in ranks below Warrant Officer,  R.N.,  Army warrant officer Class I or Warrant Officer R.A.F. ...       ...       ...       One halfprovided that for the purpose of paragraph 12 (/;) the resultant reckonable period ofservice shall not exceed the period between the date of the officer&apos;s 21st birthday andthe date of his commission.14. Where there has been a break in service, the previous service may be taken intoaccount provided that the interval between the two periods of service is less than fiveyears.15. The existing provisions under which service in certain localities counts as doubletime is withdrawn.Rank16. Normally only substantive rank held on the active list will be taken into account in assessing retired pay under the new code. War substantive rank granted while onthe active list under the special promotion arrangements in operation during the1939-45 war will, however, be allowed to reckon for this purpose. Provision will alsobe made for acting and temporary rank one step above substantive rank held underthis war-time promotion scheme to qualify, on the lines of the existing arrangements,for increase of retired pay under the new code.17. At present the grading of Brigadier in the Army is an appointment and not arank. It is the intention to provide in future a substantive rank of Brigadier togetherwith an establishment, officers filling vacancies in which will be enabled to qualify for the retired pay of that rank. Until these arrangements have been completed,however, service in a Brigadier&apos;s appointment will not qualify for a higher rate of retired pay than that appropriate to the officer&apos;s substantive rank, except that for thepurpose of the war-time scheme referred to in paragraph 16 above an officer who while holding the substantive rank of Colonel has served in a Brigadier&apos;s appointment willbe treated as having held the temporary rank of Brigadier while so serving.Invalided Officers18. The detailed arrangements applicable to invalided officers are under review.Application of new code19.
