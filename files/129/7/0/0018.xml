THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 68.19th February, 1946.CABINET.RESULTS OF FINAL SESSION OF THE UNITED MARITIME.EXECUTIVE BOARD.Memorandum by the Minister of War Transport.IN paper CP. (46) 42 I explained the issues confronting us at the FinalSession of the United Maritime Executive Board. The Board completed its workthis week and I append (Annex) copy of the Recommendations made by the board to the contracting Governments in the United Maritime Authority as to theshipping arrangements after the 2nd March when that Authority comes to an end.2.   The Recommendations of the Board may be summarised as follows :  (i) To cover the heavy movement of cargoes for U.N.R.R.A. and forcertain liberated nations from the United States and Canada,shipping is to be contributed by nations able and electing to do so.The employment of the shipping for these purposes will be controlledthrough a Contributory Nations Committee in Washington,(ii) A Co-ordinating and Review Committee in London will make arrange-ments for shipping for U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s requirements from other areas.This Committee will also keep under review the tonnage situation inloading areas other than the United States and Canada. From our point of view, the primary object of this Committee is to give usan opportunity through the contacts with other maritime nationsthus established to correct any tendency to draw off an excessiveamount of European-owned tonnage from Eastern hemisphererequirements.(iii) In a separate Part of the Recommendations it is proposed that thereshould be a United Maritime Consultative Council through which governments will be able to exchange information on shipping-questions and which may consider any problems that may arise and make appropriate recommendations to Governments if necessary.This provision for continued consultation on shipping questions seemsto me an essential for the transitional period. The Council will haveno executive powers and its functions and procedure are only verygenerally sketched in the proposal. In particular, the relationship of this body to the United Nations Organisation will need to be defined. The Council will probably meet in May when theopportunity for proposing the necessary arrangements in this regardwill arise. Meanwhile my representatives have safeguarded theposition of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this point.(iv) All these arrangements are for a transitional period ending not later than the 31st October, 1946.(v) Provision is made for Governments not participating in the united maritime Authority to join in these arrangements. I expect thatsome other Governments may wish to subscribe to Part &quot; B &quot; at least.The procedure in this regard, will be arranged through ForeignOffice.3. I draw my colleagues&apos; particular attention to Recommendation 6. Thiswas inserted at our strong insistence that there should be some assurance that united States tonnage will continue to be available in sufficient quantities to meet
requirements. It is naturally drafted with great care since the United states could not be pressed to give the world a blank cheque (as they put it) to draw upon their shipping. This would not be in our interest or that of other maritimenations. On the other hand, a public statement of this kind does help to minimise the difficulties which are created by the acute shortage of tonnage available through commercial channels and should help to relieve the pressure on the freightmarket.4. During the session of the Board, my representatives have come to aseparate agreement with the United States to ensure that sufficient United Statestonnage will be at our disposal during the coming few months. The United states delegation took the line that they could not give us authority to draw, as were quired, upon their shipping for our programmes, if, at the same time, we were so deploying our shipping in other trades, where it is in competition with UnitedStates ships, as to create opposition in the United States. The number of ships that we can spare for the time being for operating in these trades is, in any case,limited by our tonnage shortage, but our aim is to restore our liner interests inthese trades to the maximum extent as rapidly as possible. We therefore statedto the United States Delegation what sailings we intended in the liner trades concerned over the next four months and, in return for the United States guarantee of the amount of tonnage we required to meet our overall commitments, have under-taken that these sailings will not be exceeded during that period. Provision ismade for these sailings to be reviewed not later than the end of June 1946, bywhich time we may be in a better position to increase them. The understanding with the United States also regulates the United States liner sailings in the north atlantic for which we can be expected to provide Government cargo. The numberof sailings is not increased above sailings in recent months.5. It is also agreed with the War Shipping Administration that they willtake no action to terminate the current arrangements under which we have theuse of about 3 million tons deadweight of United States Government-ownedtonnage on bareboat charter under the British flag. This relieves any anxietyfor the next few months on this score.6. All these arrangements must, from our point of view, be regarded asdevices to secure breathing-space during which we must make every effort tostrengthen our shipping position by reducing the tonnage assigned to naval andmilitary service and by expediting repairs, reconditioning and new construction.I hope my colleagues will agree that we have covered ourselves as well as couldbe expected having regard to the weakness of our current shipping situation.7. Acceptance of Part &quot;A&quot; of the Recommendations does not in itself impose upon us any obligation to provide any tonnage for U.N.R.R.A. and the liberatednations either from the United States and Canada in the Contributory Pool orfrom elsewhere. But, we cannot afford to be excluded from these trades and weshall continue, as in the past, to give such help as we are able through our linerservices on the routes concerned and otherwise as circumstances may permit.Our contribution to the Contributory Pool will be small. We have certain linerservices from the United States and Canada to the European Continent and tothe Ear East which we wish to maintain.   We must do the best we can in addition.8. I therefore seek authority to notify the other contracting Governmentsof our acceptance of Part &quot; A &quot; and Part &quot; B &quot; of the Recommendations.A.

ANNEX.UNITED MARITIME EXECUTIVE BOARD.Fourth Session.RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONTRACTING GOVERNMENTS.Note by the Secretariat.1. Appended is a copy of the Recommendations as approved by the board at its final meeting on the 11th February.2. Delegates are asked to draw the attention of their Governments to thedesirability of notifying their acceptance at the earliest possible date.11th February, 1946.The United Maritime Executive Board, during its fourth and final session,being unanimously of the opinion that the return to normal processes of intersnational shipping should not be retarded, nevertheless recognises that certain difficulties and problems might arise in the shipping situation after the termina-tion on the 2nd March next of the Agreement on Principles of August, 1944,and believes that it would be desirable for Governments to take measures during a limited transitional period to the end that such problems might be resolvedand difficulties minimised. Accordingly they have agreed upon the following recommendations for the consideration of contracting Governments : 1. That all nations who have regularly contributed tonnage to the commontasks shall continue to provide shipping for the common tasks of relief and rehabilitation.Arrangements for dry cargo from the United States and Canadian Loading Areas.2. That a Contributory Nations Committee, consisting of representatives ofnations contributing tonnage to provide shipping space for relief and rehabilitation-tion programmes from the United States and Canada, shall be established in washington.3. That U.N.R.R.A. and liberated nations requiring assistance from the contributory Pool referred to in 4 below; shall programme their shippingrequirements and submit them to the Washington Committee established in above.  The procedure to be followed is set out in the Appendix.4. That at the outset of the agreement each contributory nation shall declareto the Washington Committee the maximum and minimum monthly sailings ortonnage it will contribute for the period of the agreement. The tonnage thuscontributed is referred to herein as the Contributory Pool.5. That a Co-ordinating and Review Committee representative of nationsaccepting Part &quot; A &quot; of this agreement shall be set up in London.This Committee 1(a) Shall consider UN.R.R.A.&apos;s requirements for loading in areas other thanthe United States and Canada. The nations accepting Part &quot;A&quot;of this agreement recognise the necessity for meeting such require-ments to the best of their ability and through their representatives onthe Committee shall co-ordinate the provision of tonnage they are ableto make available for these programmes.Recommendations.PartA.Arrangements for dry cargo from other Loading Areas.
(b) Shall keep the tonnage situation in loading areas other than the UnitedStates and Canada constantly under review. Recognising the necessityfor an adequate supply of tonnage for loading in those areas thenations represented shall authorise the Committee to consider and recommend the measures that should be taken to assist the fulfilment of the programmes affected in the event that normal commercialchannels are failing to ensure an adequate supply of tonnage.General.6. That nations needing shipping assistance other than that secured fromthe Contributory Pool shall make suitable arrangements for the procurement oftonnage through commercial channels or may request it from other nations. Thenations from whom tonnage is requested shall make all reasonable efforts to make available the requested shipping space at fair, reasonable and compensatory rates,subject to the reservation that they need not supply such tonnage if it is to be usedin a manner contrary to the interests of the nation upon whom the request hasbeen made.Appendix to Part &quot;A.&quot;1. To maintain without interruption the maximum flow of relief and rehabilitation cargoes from the United States and Canada, a ContributoryNations Committee shall be established in Washington as provided in 2 ofPart &quot;A.&quot;2. With respect to loadings from Canadian ports, the Washington Com-mittee shall collaborate with a Canadian Sub-Committee to be established in montreal.3. U.N.R.R.A. and each liberated Nation requiring shipping assistance forthe carriage of such cargoes shall submit to this Committee by the 1st of each month its total programme of cargo loadings in the United States and Canadashowing the number of coal, grain or other full, bulk cargoes, and the number ofgeneral cargoes programmed for loading during the following month, and estimates in the same form for the next two months. The programme for the specific month should also show the number, nationality and total cargo capacityof vessels already available to the programming claimant for loading during that month.4. By the 10th of each month each contributing Nation shall notify theCommittee as to the amount of tonnage that it expects to have available, suchtonnage to be within the maxima and minima as agreed in accordance with 4 ofPart &quot; A,&quot; and by the 15th of each month shall confirm the actual tonnage to besupplied against the following month&apos;s requirements, such tonnage to be statedseparately in liner sailings and in tramps.5. In arranging and determining the amount of tonnage to be provided under 4 of this Appendix, individual members of the Committee shall at all timescommunicate direct with their respective Nations, who shall, in consideringrequests for tonnage to load in the United States and Canada, make every effort to avoid causing a deficiency in the supply of tonnage required for other loadingareas.6. To meet each month&apos;s berthing requirements in the United States, theCommittee shall allocate all of the agreed available tonnage through the establishedmachinery of the War Shipping Administration, so that appropriate co-ordina-tion with respect to loading facilities, inland transportation and availablity of cargoes may be secured and the maximum flow of cargo for the month achieved,together with the most efficient use of the shipping available.Part &quot; B.&quot;7.   That:-(A) Accepting Governments should meet periodically for discussions in a united Maritime Consultative Council for the purpose of exchanginginformation to the end that individual Governments may be enabled to frame their own policies in the post-U.M.A. period in the lightof the knowledge of the policies of other Governments.
(B) The Council may undertake the consideration and study, for the purposeof making appropriate recommendations to member Governments,of any problems in the international shipping field, which may bereferred to it and which do not come within the terms of reference of other established governmental conferences or associations active in the field.&quot;(C) It is the intention that the shipping industry should collaborate and assist in devising ways and means to implement the common objectivesstated in (A) and (B).(D) Meetings of the Council should be held at such times and places as theCouncil may determine. A chairman for each meeting should be designated by the Government of the nation where such meeting isto be held.   The Council should determine its own procedure.(E) The United Maritime Consultative Council should have no executive powers.(E) This part of the agreement should be open for acceptance by Govern-ments whether or not they accept Part &quot;A.&quot;Part &quot; C.&quot;8. That the arrangements in Parts &quot; A &quot; and &quot; B &quot; shall remain in effect from the 3rd March until the 31st October, 1946, unless by unanimous consentof the Governments accepting the respective Parts it is decided to terminatethem at an earlier date.9. That Governments accepting the recommendations in Part &quot; A &quot; and/or part &quot; B &quot; shall notify their acceptance to the United States and UnitedKingdom Governments at the earliest possible date and that, as between  theGovernments notifying their acceptance, the relevant recommendations shall beregarded as an agreement for the period stated in Recommendation 8.10.
