1*1THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT- - &quot;Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1946.SECRET.CP. (46) 62.13th February, 1946CABINET.POST-WAR FIRE SERVICE.Joint Memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland.AT their meeting on the 8th February (L.P. (46) 5th Conclusions, Minute 3)the Lord Presidents Committee agreed that the future organisation of the fire service should be on lines which we had proposed, and asked us to submit our proposals to the Cabinet when the question of Exchequer grant to fire authorities could be discussed. This memorandum sets out the proposals agreed by theCommittee.2. Before the war the Fire Service was a. local authority Service under thecontrol of 1,660 separate local authorities in Great Britain. In England andWales the authorities were the London County Council and the Councils ofboroughs, urban districts and rural districts, and in Scotland the Councils of counties and burghs.3. This organisation did not prove satisfactory for the purpose of fire-fighting in the war, and in 1941 .the National Fire Service was established.During the passage of the Bill through the House of Commons, the Home Secretarystated that it was the definite intention of the Government that, after the war,the Service should again be a local authority Service. In a further statement which he made in the House of Commons on the 13th June, 1943, he made it clearthat he had not given any undertaking that the Service would go back to thesame local authorities as were responsible before the war.4. We do not think that there can be any doubt that, for purposes of war,it is essential that the Fire Service should be a National Service, and we thinkthat the experience which has been gained during the war justifies the conclusionthat, for purposes of peace-time fire-fighting, the most efficient organisation would be a national one. We think, however, that for peace-time purposes itwould be possible to organise an adequate Service on a local authority basis,provided that it is organised in larger units than those which existed beforethe war.5. Discussions have for some time been proceeding with the local authority associations concerned, with a view to obtaining agreement as to the post-warorganisation, but it has not been possible to arrive at an agreed solution. In -England and Wales there is no indication of any support for the continuanceof the National Fire Service, and the local authorities, generally, took up theposition at the beginning of the discussions that the Service should be restored to the pre-war authorities. They recognise now, however, that some modificationof the pre-war structure is required, but there is no agreement as to what thatmodification should be. In Scotland opinion is more divided, and there is asubstantial minority of local authorities in favour of continuing the national fire Service.copy No.     u[31316]
6. In these circumstances, it is necessary for the Government to frame itsown scheme, and the conclusions to which we have come are as follows : (a) In England and Wales the Service should normally be administered bythe Councils of Counties and County Boroughs, with suitable provisionfor special arrangements to meet the case of particular areas where an organisation on this basis would not be consistent with the require-ments of efficiency.(6) In Scotland the Service should be administered by the Councils of counties and large Burghs organised in eleven areas, within each ofwhich there would be a single operational unit under joint localauthority administration.This Would involve the supersession as fire authorities of the Councils ofnon-county boroughs and urban and rural districts in England and Wales, andof the Councils of small burghs in Scotland, and the transfer in England andWales of functions to the Councils of counties which have not previously been concerned (outside London) with fire brigade administration. The scheme,therefore, will arouse considerable opposition.7. We propose that the powers of the Secretary of State to supervise theadministration of the Fire Service should be substantially increased, so as toenable him to prescribe general standards of cover and of training and of generalefficiency and to ensure that pay and the main conditions of service throughoutthe country are settled on standard lines, and that there are arrangements forsecuring a reasonably consistent system of promotion and discipline.8. The proposals mentioned in the preceding paragraph are believed tobe acceptable in principle to the local authorities, but they have indicated fromthe beginning that they would expect them to be accompanied by provision fora Government grant towards the cost of the Service. We have made it clear to them that we have no authority to discuss with them the question of a grant,but it is our opinion that, unless we are to abandon the idea of control and super-vision of the Fire Service, the introduction of a grant on the lines of that whichis made towards the cost of the Police is unavoidable.9.   We accordingly recommend -(a) that arrangements should be made for the transfer of the Fire Service,as soon as possible, to the control of the Councils of counties and county boroughs in England and Wales, and of counties and large burghsin Scotland, subject to the modifications indicated in paragraph 6 (a)and (5);(&amp;) that the Secretary of State should have power to prescribe standards of fire Service cover, of training and general efficiency, and to settle the pay and main conditions of service on standard lines, and to secure a reasonably consistent system of promotion and discipline;(c) that a grant, based on the approved expenditure of the fire authorities,should be introduced as part of the system for securing the necessarystandards of efficiency;(d) that we should be authorised to make an immediate announcement ofthese decisions and to prepare the necessary Bill for introduction asl[   soon as possible.J. C. E.J. W.13th February, 1946.
