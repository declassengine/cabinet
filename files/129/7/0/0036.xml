fHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY/S GOYERNMICMT-    128Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1946.SECRET. Copy No.    3gCP. (46) 86.1st March, 1946.-CABINET.NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE BILL.Memorandum by the Minister of Health.I submit (appended to this Paper) my draft National Health Service Bill.The proposals contained in it were given general approval by the Cabinet on the20th December, 1945 (CM. (45) 65th Conclusions. Minute 3). Heads of theBill itself were approved by the Cabinet on the 8th January last (CM. (46)3rd Conclusions, Minute 1).2. I ask to be authorised to introduce the Bill into the House of commons during the present month. If my colleagues approve the Bill I also ask in orderto save time to be allowed to make any amendments of a minor or drafting naturewhich may be found desirable to give final form to the Bill after it has beenapproved and before its introduction. . Concurrently with its introduction,: Ipropose to issue a short White Paper explaining the new service in outline, as was done in the case of the National Insurance Bill.Results of Discussions of Proposals.3. During the past two months the Secretary of State for Scotland and Ihave had a series of discussions with representatives of those whose experienceappeared likely to be of the greatest value in framing the Bill. The proposals have been explained to them in confidence, and they have been asked for their considered views as experts, not as delegates entitled to commit their principals.4. In general the reactions have not been unfavourable. The localauthorities are divided in their views. The London County Council accepts theproposals subject to minor points on which I think they can be met; the CountyCouncils&apos; Association has expressed some opposition, and the Association of municipal Corporations also, and there will inevitably be some unfavourablecomment from the representatives of minor authorities which are to lose their functions to the county councils. But in general I do not anticipate strong opposition from local authorities, particularly in view of the lead given bv theL.C.C.5. The representatives of the medical profession have felt unable to go very far in expressing opinions except on comparatively minor issues, owing to the restricted nature of their mandate from their principals. There will certainly be vocal opposition when the Bill is published, but I am satisfied that the mostresponsible members and leaders of the profession are broadly reassured that theproposals in it represent a reasonable and fair solution of the problems involved.6. The voluntary hospital representatives are hostile, and will do all they canto organise opposition. Even here, however, the more responsible and experiencedleaders of the movement realise and accept the fact that the principles embodied in the proposals are reasonable.7. The discussions with other interested parties have not revealed anything more than minor points of difference. There may be some opposition from sight-testing opticians to the, proposals for gradually replacing the present eye services by specialist eye clinics based on the hospital service.   I hope, however, that if[31391] b
arrangements can be made for existing opticians (but not newcomers) to be engagedpart-time as refractionists in the clinics a matter which is left open by the bill itself, and will be settled later we may secure their co-operation and support.8. From the political point of view, Government supporters may fasten on two points for criticismi the proposals for providing private pay-beds for privatetreatment (Clause 5), and the method of remuneration of doctors. On the first point Clause 5 carries out the proposal already approved by the Cabinet it is indeed essential if we are to attract some of the best specialists into the service from the outset--but with one important modification, namely, it is made clearthat the provision of private accommodation will be dependent on my being satisfied that it is justifiable to provide it, in each case having regard to theneeds of the ordinary public service; and also that the use of that accommodation for private purposes may at any time be overridden if it is needed urgently fora non-paying patient under the public service. This should go far to meet any criticism. On the second point, the Bill does not itself determine the methodof remunerating general practitioners, but leaves it to the general regulationsregarding their terms of service. The same procedure was adopted in the oldNational Health Insurance law. I am sure it is right, with a view to future developments and changes in method which may become desirable and whichwould require legislation unless they could be covered by regulations. The questionof method of payment will be one of the main things raised in the debates onthe Bill, no doubt; but the absence of any express provision settling it in theBill itself will not in any way impede the freedom of members to raise it andtherefore should not be a matter for criticism.Synopsis of Clauses.9. Clauses 1 and 46 and the Eighth Schedule put upon the Minister thegeneral duty to establish a comprehensive health service and transfer to him the mental health functions of the Board of; Control (except quasi-judicial functions designed to safeguard the liberty of the subject, which will continueto be exercised by the Board).10. Clause 2 and the First Schedule provide for an expert Central health services Council to advise the Minister and empower the Minister also to appointstanding advisory sub-committees on different aspects of the service.11. Clauses 3 to 13 and the Second and Third Schedules deal with thehospital and specialist services. The duty to provide hospitals (which includesspecial and mental hospitals, clinics operated in connexion with hospitals, &amp;c.)and the services of specialists is laid upon the Minister. Existing voluntary andlocal authority hospitals, together with rights and liabilities attached to them,are transferred to the Minister. The transfer covers the property and assets ofthe voluntary hospitals as well as their premises, but does not include independentfunds such as the King Edward&apos;s Hospital Fund in London (see also paragraph23 (a) below). Regional Hospital Boards are set up which will be the employers of all hospital staff (except in teaching hospitals) and will administer the service as a whole on behalf of the Minister and in accordance with his regulations, theday-to-day administration of individual hospitals or groups of hospitals devolvingupon local Hospital Management Committees to the extent prescribed (Clause 10).12. Clauses 14 to 16 empower the Minister to provide two further directservices bacteriological laboratories and blood transfusion and to conduct and assist research.13. Clauses 17 to 28, 48 and 49 and the Fourth Schedule deal with theservices to be provided by the local health authorities. These are the county and county borough councils, with the usual provision for joint boards in casethis should be needed in a few exceptional cases. Clause 19 requires the localauthorities to provide and maintain the new health centres, at which the family practitioner services (paragraph 14 below) as well as the local authority health&apos;services will be provided. The authorities are also charged with the duty toprovide the following services-maternity and child welfare (the latter to be delegated, where appropriate, in the same way as the school health service), childlife protection, midwifery, health visiting, home nursing, vaccination andimmunisation, ambulances and the non-hospital aspects of the mental health services. They are also empowered to provide domestic help in households whereit is required on health grounds, and to make supplementary arrangements (otherthan cash payments) for the care and after-care of the sick.
3 -    12914. Clauses 29 to 44 establish the family practitioner services general practitioners and dentists, the supply of drugs, &amp;c, and provide for a temporarysupplementary eye service on the general lines of the present service until the intended service of specialist ophthalmic clinics is fully developed. New Execu-tive Councils (half professional and half &quot; consumer&quot;) are set up for each local health authority&apos;s area to administer these services, the details of which are to be governed by regulations. A special central committee is provided for, to control the distribution of medical practices within the service (Clause 32 and the SixthSchedule). Sale and purchase of the practices of doctors participating in theservice is prohibited, with compensation for existing practitioners (Clauses 33to 35).15. Clause 45 empowers the Minister to arrange refresher courses for doctors and dentists on a voluntary basis.16. Clauses 46 to 49 and the Eighth and Ninth Schedules contain the neces-sary provisions for transferring the mental health functions of the Board ofControl to the Minister and for adjusting the present law to fit the new distribu-tion of mental health duties as between the Regional Hospital Boards and the localauthorities.17. Clauses 50 to 53 provide for the financing from the Exchequer of thehospital and other services provided direct by the Minister and of the family prac-titioner services, and for a weighted 50 per cent. Exchequer grant in respect ofthe services provided by local health authorities.18. Clause 54 gives the Minister default powers over the various bodiesadministering the different services.19. Clause 55 gives the Minister and, subject to his confirmation, the local health authorities power to buy land compulsorily for purposes of the new service.20. The remaining Clauses contain miscellaneous administrative provisions,repeals, &amp;c, the most important being a new power to the Minister to provide, by regulations, for superannuation schemes for the various employees of the differentbodies functioning under the Bill (Clause 58) and also to deal by regulations withthe transfer of officers and property and the compensation of whole-time officers(Clauses 59 and 60).Form of the BUI.21. The Bill may be criticised on the ground that too much is left to be dealtwith in regulations. This is inevitable in a Bill of this kind, as it is also in theNational Insurance Bill. There is, incidentally, ample precedent for it in the oldNational Health Insurance Acts, so far as medical benefit was concerned. In thepresent case the amount left to regulations can be defended on the grounds : (a) of the desirability of giving as much elasticity as possible to the serviceand allowing adjustments of detail with gathering experience, withoutthe need for amending legislation;(b) of the fact that many of the detailed arrangements will require discussionwith the professions and others concerned before they can be fairlysettled;(c) of the sheer need to &apos;save Parliamentary time this session.Provision is made for affirmative resolutions in the case of regulations governing the superannuation, transfer and compensation of officers, which willimpose charges on the Exchequer.22. The Bill also inevitably appears to give the wrong relative prominenceto some of the different parts of the service; e.g., it has to deal expressly with thetemporary supplementary eye service, while the real main ophthalmic service is covered by the general clauses on hospital and specialist services and so requiresno express mention. This sort of apparent false perspective can be corrected bythe covering White Paper.- 1      Some Special Points on the Bill.23. Generally, the proposals in the Bill cover familiar ground, already coii-sidered by my colleagues, and they need not be reviewed again in this paper.There are, however, some particular points to which I ought to draw attention : (a) Existing funds of voluntary hospitals.-8pecial provision is made, as previously contemplated, for any hospitals designated by the Minister as teaching[31391] si   ; &quot; b 2m
hospitals. They will not be administered by the Regional Boards and Manage-ment Committees, but each will have its own special Board of Governors consti-tuted under the,Bill (Clauses 9 and 11 and the Third Schedule). Ownership ofthe hospital premises and equipment will vest in the Minister, but all the presentendowments and other funds of existing teaching hospitals will automaticallybecome the property of the new Boards of Governors and thus remain attachedto the hospitals to which they attach now. There is some pressure that I should adopt the same course with all the funds of all voluntary hospitals; but it isquite clear that to try to earmark them in any special way within the newadministrative machinery of the Regional Boards would be impracticable, andI have not accepted the suggestion beyond the provision in Clause 6 requiring meto secure as far as possible that the objects to which the funds were devoted in thepast are not prejudiced.I have inserted in Clause 7 a provision to protect the Government againstthe loss of hospital property through any transfers made by hospitals before theappointed day in an attempt to evade the Act.(b) Vaccination and immunisation will not form part of the ordinary dutiesof a general practitioner under his terms of service, but the local health authority is required by Clause 24 to make arrangements for this service and therefore topay fees to the doctors who provide it. I regret the necessity for the latter partof this provision, but I am satisfied that without it vaccination which is nolonger to be compulsory and diphtheria immunisation will not be carried out to the extent we desire. In order to get a satisfactorily high proportion of thepopulation vaccinated and immunised it is necessary not only to direct propagandaat the patient, but to give the general practitioner some incentive to take theinitiative.(c) Sale and purchase of medical practices. (Clauses 33 to 35.) The sale and purchase of the practice of any doctor participating in the service (but not of purely private practices) will be prohibited. Any doctor who before anappointed day gets his name on to an Executive Council&apos;s list i.e., is accepted as a participant in the future service will be entitled to compensation for thefull value of his practice determined, in accordance with regulations, as a pro-portion of the estimated global value of all medical practices on the date inquestion. I am at the moment -with the help and advice of the government actuary trying to agree with the profession^ representatives what that globalsum should properly be, and I therefore hope that the figure inserted in Clause34 will be an agreed one. I should like authority to insert in the Bill, before its introduction, whatever figure may be agreed between the Chancellor of theExchequer and myself in the light of the above discussions with the profession.I think that, as the figure for Great Britain is likely to be in the neighbourhoodof  66 million, the figure to go in the Bill will be the proportion of that totalappropriate to England and Wales. The apportionment of the sum will belater determined, in consultation with the profession itself. The relevant regula-tions will provide for the amount of compensation payable to each individual,and lay down that it shall normally be credited to the doctor and paid onlyon his death or retirement from the public service. There will, however, be provision for payment or part payment at the outset of the scheme in the caseof doctors with any considerable outstanding loans to repay in respect of thepast purchase by them of practices. Compensation will need to be paid at the outset also in the case of doctors who die or retire from practice between thepassing of the Act and the appointed day and whose practices have not been soldbefore that date. In other cases, until the compensation becomes payable, the doctor will receive annually interest at the rate of 2f per cent, on&quot; the sumstanding to his credit.Clause 33 prohibits the sale of practices where compensation has been paid as well as of future practices, and contains elaborate provisions designed as faras possible to prevent evasion by fraudulent transactions, e.g., by the sale of a doctor&apos;s house at a fancy price.(d) Dismissal of general practitioners and others. (Clause 40 and the SeventhSchedule.) Under the present law a doctor, dentist or chemist participating inthe national health insurance service can be excluded, permanently or temporarily,from that service on the decision of the Minister. In future, however, when thewhole population will be covered by the public service, to exclude a man fromthe service may, in effect, be to deprive him of his whole livelihood. I have cometo the conclusion, therefore, that the decision should be exercised, not by the
Minister, but by an independent tribunal containing a representative of the parti-cular profession concerned, with a right of appeal to the Minister against thetribunal^ decision. The Bill provides for such a tribunal, composed of a lawyer,a layman and a member of whatever profession is concerned in each case.(e) Finance. The new service will be financed jointly by the Exchequer andthe rates and from contributions under the National Insurance Scheme. TheExchequer will bear : (i) the whole cost of the hospital and specialist services (Clause 52);(ii) the whole cost of the &apos;&apos; family practitioner &apos;&apos; services (Clause 52); and. (iii) half the cost (a weighted 50 per cent, grant) of the local health authority services.Offset against the total cost will be some  32 million in respect of Englandand Wales transferred to the Exchequer from the National Insurance Fund,together with any income derived from the transferred assets of voluntary hospitals. The effect of (i) on the block grant payable to local authorities is atpresent under consideration with the Treasury, but does not affect the financial provisions to be included in this Bill.(f) Appointed days. -A great deal of preliminary work will require to bedone before the new service can be provided. It will, however, be necessary tobring the service as a whole into operation not later than the full national insurance system; and, in addition, different parts of the Bill will need to comeinto operation at different times. The necessary power for this is given byClauses 70 and 71, the different days being appointed by Order in Council.A. B.Ministry of Health, S.W. 1,1st March, 1946.
