(46) 70.20th February, 1946.CABINET.ADMISSION OF WOMEN TO THE FOREIGN SERVICE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Committee Avhich I appointed last summer to re-examine the questionof the admission of women into the Foreign Service have now submitted theattached unanimous report.2. On the assumption that a general marriage bar will be imposed, which theSecretary of State could waive in exceptional circumstances, the committee recommend that women should be equally eligible with men for admission to theService. In order, however, to safeguard the Service against the possibility of a sudden disproportionate inflow of women recruits, they recommend a limitationof the numbers recruited during the Reconstruction period to a maximum of10 per cent, of the total admitted from the Reconstruction Competition.3. The Committee also recommend that the admission of women should notbe regarded as an experiment in the same sense as in earlier proposals for their employment in the Foreign Service. But they recognise that it would, in fact, be&quot;part of a general experiment.&quot; They accordingly recommend that the suit-ability of women for service in posts, both diplomatic and consular, hithertoregarded as insalubrious or otherwise of doubtful suitability should be put to early test, and that no discrimination should be shown by the Secretary of State intheir posting.4. My view, with which I hope my colleagues will agree, is that we should accept the recommendations of the Committee. There is only one slight caveatI would make in connection with the final part of the Committee&apos;s recommenda-tions. While I agree that no discrimination should be made by me in posting-women abroad, I could not agree to the interests of our representation abroadbeing subordinated to the need of &quot; making the experiment real &quot; (see para-graph 49 of the report). It would be wrong to post a woman, or, for that matter,a man, to a place where we did not think that they would fit in and where we didnot think their presence would be in the public interest.E.

ANNEX.Report by the Committee appointed by the Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs to Re-Examine the Question of Admission of Women toBranch A of the Foreign Service.Sir,1. You appointed us to be a Committee to re-examine the question of the admission of women to the Foreign Service, and to furnish a report thereon for your information.2. The Foreign Service is divided into five Branches (A to E), Branch Acorresponding roughly to the Administrative Grade of the Home Civil Service.Women are at present excluded only from established posts in Branch A of theService, and our enquiry relates therefore to Branch A alone.3. We have met on eighteen occasions, and have heard the oral evidence offorty-six witnesses. Their names and, where they appeared in a representativecapacity, the names of the Societies or other bodies they represented, are listed inthe Appendix to this Report. We have also had before us a number of writtenstatements. Both oral and written evidence was given with the knowledge thatit would be treated as confidential, and we recommend therefore that the records of evidence and the written statements submitted to us should not be made public,except in so far as they are quoted in this Report.4. The subject was last considered in 1936. His Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad before them a Report made in 1934 by an interdepartmental Committee of eight members under the chairmanship of Lord (then Sir Claud) Schuster. the diplomatic and Consular Services were then separate. The Committee was unableto make a unanimous recommendation about either. As regards the diplomatic service, four members gave an unqualified verdict against the admission of womenat that time, two an unqualified verdict in favour of it, and two recommended theiradmission for an experimental period of seven years. As regards the ConsularService, six members advised definitely against any employment of women; theother two, while agreeing that it &apos;&apos; might be premature to recommend theimmediate and unrestricted opening &quot; of the Service to them, proposed that theyshould be tested in it by &quot; a limited number &apos;&apos; being seconded to it from the home civil Service.5. The decision of the Government was that &apos;&apos; the time has not yet arrivedwhen women could be employed either in the Diplomatic or in the ConsularService with advantage to the State or with profit to women.&quot; They explainedthat, as regards the Consular Service, they were much impressed by the &apos;&apos; virtualunanimity &apos;&apos; of the Schuster Committee upon the inadvisability of admittingwomen, that &quot; in the very large majority of consular posts officers have to dealwith a large number of matters which it would be difficult for the average womanto handle,&quot; and that for this reason women would &quot; in practice find themselveshampered and restricted &apos;&apos; and would not be able to give such efficient service as men. As regards the Diplomatic Service, they based their decision mainly on the consideration that &quot; an essential element for success in diplomatic lifeconsists in members of the Service being favourably received in the countries towhich they are posted &apos;&apos;; that &apos;&apos; there are .... many countries where the positionof women is very different from what it is in this country,&quot; and that theywere &quot; satisfied that in a large number of countries the innovation would notbe welcomed.&quot; They also pointed out that marriage presented a problem ofgreat difficulty.   (Cmd. 5166 of 1936.)6. Paragraphs 4 to 13 of the Report of the Schuster Committee contain ahistorical surrnriary of the events affecting the admission of women into the Serviceof the Crown, and it is not necessary for us to repeat it. But there is onehistorical fact that we must recall, because it affects fundamentally our approach to the subject. To quote from the Schuster Report&apos;s enumeration of the argu-ments addressed to them in favour of the admission of women :
&quot; The governing principle [of the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, 1919]is that stated in the opening words of the first Section : &quot;A person shall not hedisqualified by sex from being appointed to or holding any Civil Office &quot;; and thefact that the rights so conferred can only be cut down when His Majestyauthorises regulations to be made reserving&apos; to men posts abroad, suggests thatthose who desire to maintain such a reservation should show good cause for making, or when (as in this case) it is already imposed, retaining it.&quot; We think the argument well-founded that Parliament has thus placed the burden of proofupon those who say that women should continue to be excluded from anyparticular Service, and we have so approached our task. It is unnecessary to add that, in considering whether they have established their case, we have had regardsolely to what we believe will best contribute to the efficiency of the foreign service.7. The question that we have to answer is different in one cardinal respectfrom that which was before the Schuster Committee. In 1943 the diplomatic service, the Consular Service, and the Commercial Diplomatic Service wereamalgamated into a single &apos;&apos; Foreign Service &quot;; the Foreign Office (alreadyamalgamated with the Diplomatic Service but still regarded as part of the home civil Service) was included, and was severed from the Home Civil Service. Infuture, &quot; every officer of the combined Service will be called upon to serve inconsular and commercial diplomatic as well as in diplomatic posts and in theForeign Office, and will have the opportunity of rising to the highest posts.Interchange between the different branches, and between posts at home and thoseabroad, will be facilitated with the object of giving every man as wide anexperience as possible and of enabling the best man to be sent to any vacant post.&quot;(Cmd. 6420 of 1943.)8.   This new combined Service is to be recruited by methods devised withthe objective &quot; that every member of our Foreign Service should be in the fullestsense representative of our whole nation, of every class and section of thecommunity, and that he should be able to deal in the country in which he isaccredited with the whole nation, irrespective of class or outlook.&quot;   (The Under-Secretary of State, House of Commons, 18th March. 1943.)   Instead of being required, as before the war, to compete in French, German, European history and Economics, in addition to a minimum of other subjects, candidates for theForeign Service will in future take the same examination as that for the Aclminis-trative Class of the Home Civil Service, except that all candidates for theForeign Service will have to satisfy the Civil Service Commissioners, in a qualifying oral test, of their potential ability to learn to converse in modemforeign languages; and that the age-limits are slightly different 21 to 23, insteadof 21 to 24.   The tests in this examination will be so designed as to enablestudents who have taken a good Honours degree in any of the major faculties to&apos;compete immediately after their degree examinations without any special study.It will be the standard method of entry, by which not less than three-quarters ofthe vacancies will be filled.  It will include an interview before a Selection Board,,but the emphasis will be on the written part of the examination, comparable inrange and difficulty with an Honours Degree examination.   Any candidate who wishes may compete, whether he has been to a University or not.   In addition,there will be an alternative method of entry in which the emphasis is on the test of personality.  It consists of a written examination in English and other general!subjects requiring no special preparation, followed by such tests of personalqualities as the Civil Service Commissioners may prescribe, including an interviewbefore a Selection Board.  Only candidates who have taken a degree with at least2nd Class Honours may compete by this method, which is to be tried experi-mentally for 10 years.   Not more than a quarter of the vacancies will be filled by it, and candidates will not be accepted unless they reach a really high standard.Successful candidates of both classes are to be sent abroad for eighteen months&apos;study; they will then have to pass a qualifying examination in the subjects ofthat study (Languages, History and Economics), and here again they must satisfyan interview Board of their personal suitability.  They will then become membersof the Foreign Service, subject to one year&apos;s probationary period of work in thiscountry.9. It will also be open to the Secretary of State, on the recommendation ofthe Civil Service Commissioners, to make not more than two appointments a year,without any examination, of persons above the normal age-limit but not above 30.
This is for the purpose of being &quot; able, in exceptional cases, to recruit personswho by their record since completing their education have shown themselvesspecially suitable for the Foreign Service.&quot; These will be chosen by a selection Board.10. The methods described in the two preceding paragraphs are to be thenormal system of recruitment. But for the present, the Foreign Service, like theHome Service, will be recruited under the &quot;Reconstruction&quot; scheme which isexpected to last at least three years, possibly four. Its purpose is to fill vacanciesthat have accumulated during the war, as well as current wastage, and it is theintention that Service candidates shall receive not less than three-quarters of thetotal number of vacancies, provided that a sufficient number reach the requiredstandard. During this period there will be no written competitive examinations.The competition will be similar to that by the second method described inparagraph 8 above, except that the written examination in general subjects willbe qualifying, not competitive; and the final order of merit will be determinedby the Selection Board. Candidates must have reached a certain educationalstandard, though they need not have attended a University; they must have beenborn after the 1st August, 1915, and must have attained the age of 21 in theyear in which they take the examination. Every candidate will be allowed to compete twice.11. There is one other feature of this reorganisation that we must mention.The new Foreign Service is to include not only the Diplomatic, Commercial Diplo-matic, and Consular Services, but also their subordinate branches, in which manywomen are already serving. An avenue of promotion is to be provided fromBranch B to Branch A (see paragraph 2 above), but it will, of course, as mattersnow stand, be open only to men.12. We have referred to this reorganisation in some detail because there are many ways in Avhich it has a bearing on facts and arguments that we shall haveto consider later. But at this stage we are concerned only with the preliminarypoint that it is. no longer open to us, as it was to the Schuster Committee, torecommend, as in fact some of its members did, the admission of women into oneof the Services and their continued exclusion from the other. To-day it must beall or nothing.13. There is one other change since 1934 that we must record at the outset.At that time no women were employed by the Foreign Office on administrative work, either at home or abroad. To-day, under the exigencies of war, twenty-ninehave been serving as temporary administrative assistants in the Foreign Office, ofwhom three have recently been appointed to serve abroad, two as Third Secretariesand one as Vice-Consul. Two others are serving temporarily at posts abroad, oneas Attache and one as Third Secretary, after earlier service with other Govern-ment Departments.14. The arguments put before us by those who- opposed the admission ofwomen were naturally not different in substance from those put before the SchusterCommittee, and summarised in their Report, although, as we shall see, there were some marked variations in emphasis.15. Some of our witnesses, it is true, opened up fresh ground by referring to certain alleged temperamental differences between men and women. women are, it was suggested, less objective than men, less capable of keeping secrets, lessgood at team-work, more liable to allow authority to go to their heads, and moreprone to let enthusiasm run away with them. &quot; Men may be dull at times, butthey are safer,&quot; said one witness. Fortunately, we do not feel called on to expressany opinion on these matters. The need in public servants for objectivity,secrecy, co-operation, poise and discretion is not confined to the Foreign Service,and Parliament must be taken to have disposed of such arguments as these once and for all by passing the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act.16. On the other hand, we heard little of the argument that for disciplinaryand other reasons a young woman would not &apos;&apos; easily fit into the part &quot; of amember of the staff of a Chancery working on terms of the closest intimacy. Thatarguments of this sort should no longer be used is natural enough, now that menand women have worked together during the war in the closest association in so
many fields of action. Any dismay that might have been felt ten years ago by an ambassador on being told to admit a young woman into his team could hardlyhave exceeded that which would have been felt by the average Battery Commanderon hearing that he was to take women into his gun-teams; yet this was done with success in many anti-aircraft batteries.17. Coming to the arguments that remain of substance, we will take firstthose that are based on the nature of a ConsuTs life and duties. Of these theSchuster Committee said : &quot; Even the simplest may, and often do. raise questions of great difficulty,and may involve him in awkward and even dangerous situations. The featurecommon to all, or nearly all, is that they bring him into contact with com-mercial men of all classes and types, including his own countrymen, and withseafaring men of every race and colour. During a large part of his career heworks unsupported by the presence of a colleague. And the great majority ofthe posts open to him are in trying climates.&quot;18. In this summary are latent all the arguments which were submitted tous in support of the contention that women are not suitable for consular duties.They fall into two categories, which it is necessary to consider separately : the firstrests on the belief that women are handicapped because they are different from men, the second on the belief that they are handicapped because men treat themdifferently.19.. Of the arguments in the first category there is, we think, only one thatstill needs more than a brief mention. On the suggestion that women are lessable to stand adverse climatic conditions than men, we observe that the expertevidence taken by the Schuster Committee was &quot; meagre and somewhat contra-dictory,&quot; and &quot; did not lead to any definite conclusion.&quot; Our own experiencewas similar, and we do not think that this is any longer regarded as an importantobstacle to the employment.of women. Whether women find loneliness more tryingmust, we think, be a matter of conjecture, not of evidence. It is true that a woman Consul is less likely than a man to have her loneliness relieved by domesticlife, and also that public opinion allows to a man rather greater latitude of diversion than is thought fitting for a woman. But this only means that the ordealfor a woman will be harder; it does not necessarily mean that she would notundergo it successfully. And if there was ever any doubt about the capacity ofwomen to show courage, resource and leadership in dangerous situations, it hasbeen dispelled for good during the past five years.20. There remains in this category the argument succinctly put by theSchuster Committee in the words : &quot; The rough population of the dockside doesnot offer the most fruitful field for an experiment of this nature.&quot; So far as thisconsists of what has come to be known (with something less than fairness, wethink, to seafaring men as a class) as the &quot; drunken sailor argument,&quot; we do notthink it necessary to say more than this: that neither every man nor every womanis equipped by nature to handle unruly fellow-creatures easily and successfully,and we ourselves agree with those witnesses who thought that, among those whohave the gift, women&apos;s sex gives them an actual advantage. But the case forthe employment of women as Consuls at ports must stand or fall on wider considerations than this. The main reason why it fell in 1934 was the unitedopposition of certain powerful interests which have need to make use of consular officers at foreign ports-the Admiralty, Lloyd&apos;s, the Chamber of Shipping ofthe United Kingdom, and the Officers&apos; (Merchant Navy) Federation. Three ofthese four have now changed their minds. The Chamber of Shipping have told us that from the point of view of their own interests they now &quot; Avould have noobjection to the admission of women to the new amalgamated Foreign Service.&quot;The Officers&apos; Federation &quot; feel that the contribution made by women to the general war effort, and the success with which women have carried out duties requiringskill, tact and secrecy, clearly warrants a reversal of the recommendations ofthe Schuster Committee.&quot; The Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty, who in1934 thought the admission of women to the Consular Service would be &quot; mostunsuitable,&quot; now inform us that their objections can no longer be maintained in view of the signal success with which officers of the W.R.N.S. have dischargedthe many duties assigned to them at ports.  The only field in which the Admiralty
consider it impracticable to employ women is the capacity in which they wouldbe liable to act as President of a Naval Court, and of this they say : &quot;It may bethought that the occasions where this would be likely to occur are infrequent, andmight in most cases be overcome by the availability of a competent Naval Officer.&quot;21. The Committee of Lloyd&apos;s remain unconverted. They adhere to theopinion expressed in 1934 that the &quot; duties which a British Consul or Vice-Consulmight be frequently asked to perform as a Lloyd&apos;s agent are quite unsuitable for a woman.&quot; But we understand that career Consuls are seldom if ever calledupon to act in this capacity.22. In spite of this impressive testimony to the work of women, there areno doubt some places to which the Foreign Office, rightly or wrongly, would be unwilling at present to send a young woman as Vice-Consul. To that extent the admission of women to the Service might in practice tell against the principleof interchangeability of all its members to which so much importance is so rightlyattached.   We shall return to this subject.23. We now turn to objections that arise not from any alleged inherentincapacity in women, but from the attitude of others towards them. These are,in the main, two. One is the conflict that may arise in times of disturbance anddanger between a Consul&apos;s duty as protector of the British Community and areluctance on the part of the male members of it, and of the Head of the Mission,to exclude her from the time-honoured rule of &quot; women and children first.&quot; &quot; Itis not possible,&quot; said the Schuster Committee, &quot; to contemplate a situation inwhich a woman Consul should be so retained while the rest of her sex are sentto a place of security.&quot; The impossibility of contemplating this is, perhaps, not so^ self-evident now as it seemed then, for since those words were written womenwith duties to do have been retained on innumerable occasions at posts of danger.But the likelihood of embarrassment from this conflict between old ideas andnew cannot yet be wholly ruled out of account, especially in a world even moreunsettled than it was ten years ago. and is to be put-into the adverse side of thebalance, for what it is still worth, if only as another factor narrowing in practice the field of women&apos;s employment.24. The other objection that arises from the attitude of others towardswomen is of greater weight. It relates to commercial work and so affects theCommercial Diplomatic Branch of the Service as well as the Consular. We are told that here women will inevitably be handicapped by two things. One is thatthey will not have the same freedom of access as men to that fruitful field of useful information which is found in Clubs and Societies, business and other,to which women are not admitted, and also, so we are told, in the unbuttonedatmosphere of bars and restaurants not usually frequented by women, at any rate,not by the type we are considering. The other is that business men, both ourown and foreign, will look askance on women concerning themselves with businessaffairs, will resent having to deal with them and will not treat them seriously.It is no doubt partly for this reason that important bodies like the Federationof British Industries and the British Employers&apos; Confederation remain opposedto the admission of women, though they also base their opposition on the belief that in the main responsible commercial posts could not be filled successfully by women. This opinion was shared by many other individual witnesses withintimate overseas experience of dealing with commercial problems either in theService or in business. We must, however, set against this the fact that theAssociation of British Chambers of Commerce have gone over to the oppositecamp. They have informed us that the doubts which they had in 19341 have been largely removed by the outstanding part that women have played in many countriesduring the war, and that they &quot; are now in favour of the employment of women in the Diplomatic and Consular Services so long as the same high standard ofqualifications is enforced in the case of women as in the case of men; properselection of personnel is made for the posts to be occupied and local conditions at the place of employment are taken into account. Subject to these conditions the Chambers are of opinion that it will be a good thing to admit women.&quot; TheGeneral Council of the Trades Union Congress pointed out the valuable workwhich women were already performing, at home and abroad, in commercial andindustrial posts, and asserted that in this country there had been a &quot; vastinfiltration of women into many posts of responsibility.&quot;
25. Nevertheless, the evidence given to us left no doubt in our minds thata prejudice against women in business still exists in the minds of British businessmen, and is even more deeply rooted in business men of most foreign countries.If, therefore, women are admitted to&apos; the Service, one of two things must follow.Either they will, through no fault of their own, be less effective than men in this class of work (and this at a time when we cannot afford anything but the bestin a Service concerned with the re-establishment of our export trade) or theForeign Office, for this reason, will refrain from assigning women to commercialposts. This would be one more crack in the structure of interchangeability, andwould, moreover, deprive women in their early service of experience that willbe regarded as a necessary part of their qualifications for higher office.26. This brings us to the analogous objection, powerfully urged by manywitnesses, to the admission of women to the Diplomatic Service. If we ignorefor the moment the problem of marriage, which we will discuss later, it is the crucial point in the matter; it was the rock on which the case for womenfoundered in 1936. We cannot improve on the summary of this argument givenin the Schuster Report: &apos;&quot;There are countries where the social habits, the political conceptionsand the religious beliefs, both of the official classes and of the population at large, are so fundamentally different from those prevailing in this country that women are not, at least as yet, regarded in a light which would makeit possible for them to be employed as diplomatic officers. In those countriesit would be extremely difficult for a woman to make the contacts which forma large part of diplomacy, and she would find it impossible to live on easyterms with those with whom her work necessarily associated her. Theemployment of women in these countries would not increase, and in somecases would definitely decrease, the influence of British missions accreditedto them.&quot;27. How far opinion abroad has changed on this subject in the past tenyears is difficult to gauge. - Some of those who have appeared before us as advocates-cates for the admission of women supported their case by the assertion thatnumerous foreign countries had opened their Diplomatic Services to women, andthat we were lagging behind where we ought to be in the van. We find, as our predecessors did, that there is no little confusion on this subject, both about thefacts and about the inferences properly to be drawn from them. Investigationshows that evidence given to us in all good faith will not bear the weight ofthe arguments built on it. It is one thing to make an occasional appointmentof a woman; it is quite another to undertake to give appointments to all women who are successful in an annual competitive test open to both sexes. There are few countries, if any, that have adopted, and still follow, the second course, inpractice as well as theory. The great bulk of those cited as examples to us have done no more than the first, and not very much of that. This His Majesty&apos;sGovernment have also done, though the appointments made by them are, up to thepresent, only temporary. It is no doubt significant that such appointments havebeen made at all, especially in countries widely distant and widely different. Butthe facts certainly do not support the contention that this country is laggingbehind world opinion, or prove that women in the Diplomatic Service would be generally welcomed in the countries to which they were accredited.28. All witnesses agreed that there are some countries in which women wouldbe fully acceptable, some in which the status of women is such that they couldnot be sent there at present, and, between these two extremes, others in which their sex would for the present at any rate be a handicap to them to a greater or less degree. But about the number of countries to be included in this group,and the size of the handicap in each, even experienced evidence varied greatly.That is no doubt natural enough; the question is essentially one of opinion ratherthan fact.29. The evidence at least amply establishes this : that it is not to every country that a woman could now be posted and from the outset be as usefulas a man of equal capacity, and that there are some countries to which theForeign Office would regard it as impossible to post a woman at all. Somewitnesses urged that this should in itself be regarded as conclusive against allowing women to compete for entry on equal terms with men, because of the
harm it would do to the Service; the places to which women could be sent confi-dently were probably among the more attractive, socially and climatically; themen would feel a grievance; the women would not be able to have that widediversity of experience which it is hoped to give young officers in their early years; the complications of posting would be enhanced (&quot; the difficulty of getting the right man into the right place is far worse than a jigsaw puzzle, and yetit is one of the most important sides of administrative work &quot;), and it wouldbe even harder than it is now to find easy posts in which to nurse men whohave been working under great strain in exacting positions. One witness put itto us like this : &quot;I am all for the principle of a fair field and no favour,&quot; hesaid. &quot; I think women ought to be admitted to all Services where they canserve on equal terms with men. But I am all against putting women in a privi-leged position, and that is what must happen in fact if they are admitted tothe Foreign Service on nominally equal terms with men.&quot; His conclusion wasnot that women should be wholly excluded but that they should continue to beseconded temporarily to special posts, as at present.30. It was argued on the other side that this objection was exaggerated,that it was of the same kind as the objections that have always been raised tothe proposed admission of women to any new sphere; it was an instinctive reaction to something novel, and experience would soon dispel it, as has so often happenedbefore; that in almost any country a capable woman, once appointed, would soon get herself accepted on merits and &quot; in twenty years&apos; time people wouldwonder why the admission of women had ever been questioned &apos;&apos;; that &apos;&apos; people in foreign countries look on their women in one wray and on British women in another &quot;; that this was a matter in which Britain ouaht to take the lead, and now was the opportunity, when the war had left British women with a uniqueprestige all over the world; that &quot; foreign countries would be astonished if we did not use our women in peace time as we had used them during the war.&quot; Itwas also urged that diplomacy was widening its scope and would embrace mattersspecially suitable for a woman to handle and that their exclusion was manifestlyinconsistent with the intention announced by the Under-Secretary of State of having a body of Foreign Service officers &quot; in the fullest possible sense repre-sentative of our whole nation,&quot; and able &quot; to go about among the people of thecountry and get a full grasp of their interests and outlook,&quot; and that the latteraim could not be fully achieved in countries where the status of women is back-ward except by the use of women officers who could make contacts not accessible to men; finally, it was said that the interchangeability argument was beingoverworked: even in a wholly male service there could never be completeinterchangeability because of the difference between one man and another, and(in the words of an official witness) &quot; the fact of an officer being a woman willmerely add one more human factor which the Service will have to take intoaccount.&quot;. 31. All witnesses agreed that this handicap was less in the lower ranksthan it would be in the higher, and all agreed that all over the world publicopinion was changing. Some found in these facts a reason for thinking thatthe time was ripe to begin; others held that it was too soon; there were countriesin which it would be a generation or more before public opinion was ready toaccept the innovation.32. If we make a general survey of the evidence given to us and compareit with that given in 1934, two outstanding differences are at once apparent.33. The first difference is that the evidence is no longer ranged in blockson one side or the other. The Majority Report of the Schuster Committee containsthis passage . ...&quot; a perusal of the written statements and of the actual records of evidence discloses obvious divergencies in their character and quality. Onthe one side were the women&apos;s Societies, naturally eager to extend the fields offeminine activity, and fully convinced that women are as capable as men ofperforming almost any task, together with other witnesses whose evidence wasusually based on similar theories. On the other side were not only the strongly-expressed views of the Government Department most concerned, but the reportsof practically all the heads of His Majesty&apos;s Embassies and Legations abroad,of the junior officials, and of the ladies connected with the Diplomatic Servicetogether with the opinion of practically all the witnesses, male or female, who
possessed any personal and practical knowledge or experience of diplomatic life,and of the duties and responsibilities of Secretaries and heads of Missions inposts abroad, or of local feeling in foreign countries on the question at issue.One might be tempted to discount some of this body of opinion as tainted with official prejudice, if it did not coincide with that of the commercial community,as expressed by the Federation of British Industries, and by all those chambers of Commerce whose views were obtained and presented by the Association ofBritish Chambers of Commerce.&quot;34. There is no such clear-cut cleavage to-day. Witnessses still differ, butthey differ as individuals, not by classes. In the business world, for instance, theAssociation of British Chambers of Commerce and the Federation of BritishIndustries are on different sides; among shipping interests the Chamber ofShipping and Lloyds; among Government Departments, the Admiralty and theDepartment of Overseas Trade. Those members of the Foreign Service itselfwho have appeared before us are still on balance against the admission of women in the same way as men, but more than one such witness, of long experience and high position, advocated it.35. The second outstanding difference is that women seem to have captured,by their services during the war, what was in 1934 the strongest bastion of the strongest part of the case against their admission their supposed natural unsuit-ability for consular duties. In the debate on the Foreign Office reforms in 1943Mr. Law said : &quot;It is important to remember, when considering the Schuster Report,that the question of the inclusion of women in the Diplomatic Service was more or less of a tie; the Committee were very evenly divided; but therewas a very considerable majority of the Committee against the inclusionof women in the Consular Services, where their function would be so very different. If that doubt was reasonable in 1934, it becomes even more reasonable now, when we are proposing to make one combined Service, andwhen anyone who goes into the Diplomatic Service automatically goes intothe Consular Service as well.&quot;36. To-day the position is reversed. The change of opinion about the ability of women to perform consular duties has been profound and, though someobjections peculiar to that branch of the Service still remain, the case againstthe admission of women to the combined Service now rests mainly on the objection that, owing to the attitude towards them of business men generally and of theGovernments and officials of some foreign countries, they could not for the present be as useful as men over the whole field of commercial work and over a consider-able, though necessarily undefined, field of diplomatic work, and that this would impair the general efficiency of the Service in some or all of the various ways which we have described. The weight that we attach to this objection mustdetermine our conclusions.37. Its seriousness must not be underestimated, though we think there is some natural tendency to exaggerate it on the part of those witnesses whose dutiesmake them see painfully clearly how the entry of women might increase thedifficulties of running the new Service smoothly and contentedly, difficultiesalready troublesome enough, as they always are in the early stages of an amalgamation. We got the impression, moreover, that those who have had directexperience of certain types of work carried out by officers of the Women&apos;services among foreign peoples during the war incline to take a more sanguineview of their acceptability than is prevalent in the Eoreign Service itself. Wehad some interesting evidence from officers of the W.A.A.F. about their activities in certain countries in which the general view is that women would not be acceptable as representatives of His Majesty&apos;s Government. We recognise thatthe circumstances are not wholly comparable, but the opinion of the Air ministry is worth recording that &apos;&apos; in meeting and negotiating with foreign representatives,both business men and officials, rarely, if at all, did any difficulty arise becausethe British representative was a woman,&quot; and that in the opinion of theauthorities who employed women on duties of this sort (for which they were, ofcourse, carefully chosen), their quality and ability had been so high that there could be no doubt of their competence to fill posts such as are ordinarily filled bydiplomatic, commercial and consular officers.
38. Before arriving at our conclusions, it remains to examine what is called the &quot;marriage problem.&quot; This is stated as follows in the White paper of 1936&apos;&apos; It would hardly be defensible to treat women members of the diplomatic Service differently in respect of marriage from women in thehigher grades of the Civil Service generally, but if women were retained inthe Diplomatic Service after marriage, His Majesty&apos;s Government feel thatinsuperable difficulties would ensure. For instance, a woman could not be permitted to remain in the Service if she married a foreigner, and in practically every case it would be impossible for the husband of a womandiplomatic officer to exercise any profession in the country in which his wifewas serving.&quot;39. The argument here seems to be this : that because married women in the diplomatic Service would cause insuperable difficulties and because the marriagebar.has been relaxed for higher women Civil Servants, and because it is hardlydefensible to treat the two classes differently, therefore women must not beappointed to the Foreign Service. We do not understand why it should bethought &apos;&apos; hardly defensible &apos;&apos; to treat the two classes differently. We can seenothing unreasonable in it. If women are admitted, and if a strict marriage-baris thought necessary, those who choose the Foreign Service in preference to theHome will do so with their eyes open to this difference between them.40. We have heard much evidence on this. Some witnesses thought thatin no circumstances should a woman ever be allowed to remain in the Service aftermarriage. A few were in favour of having no rule and leaving to the &quot; goodsense&quot; of the women the decision whether to resign or remain. The majoritythought it necessary to impose a marriage bar which would be generally, thoughpossibly not invariably, enforced.41. That the Foreign Service presents special difficulties in the retention ofwomen after marriage needs no demonstration, and we assume that, if they are admitted, it will be thought desirable to impose a marriage-bar, even though theremay be provision for the Secretary of State to waive it in exceptional circum-stances. All that we have to consider is the bearing of that assumption on thequestion whether they ought to be admitted. We think it is small. The onlyrelevant consequence is an increase of wastage in the junior ranks of the Service.42. We have been informed that wastage is already exceptionally high inthe Foreign Service : of all career consular officers serving in 1921 no fewer than25 per cent, left before the normal retiring age. Excessive wastage is detri-mental to a Service in that it involves the loss of promising members, increases the difficulty of staffing Missions satisfactorily, and means that money spent on training is wasted. But it is not without some compensating advantages, and,in any case, we do not think that its increase by the admission of women is likelyto be more than comparatively trifling.43. It is, of course, of the utmost importance, if women are admitted, thatgreat pains should be taken to ensure that only those with suitable personalqualifications are appointed, especially the pioneers. But this point seems amplysafe-guarded both by the Reconstruction scheme and also by the system of recruitment which will follow it. The first is particularly important, as it isunder the Reconstruction scheme, if women are admitted, that the pioneers arelikely to enter. We have been reassured to learn from the First Civil service commissioner that the tests of personal qualities which have recently been intro-duced by the Commissioners experimentally as part of the Reconstructionexamination (see paragraph 10 above) are far more searching and prolonged thanthe pre-war interview of half-an-hour or so before a Selection Board. The newtests are carried out during three days&apos; residence at a testing centre, in which the candidate is tested as a member of a group as well as individually, and insituations which are as nearly as possible analogous to those in which he is likelyto find himself if he enters the Service. In the First Commissioners opinionthese tests will enable the Commissioners to judge, with far greater confidence thanheretofore, which of the candidates possess, and which lack, the qualities of mind,character and temperament needed for success in the Service.44. Our conclusions are as follows. In spite of the disappearance of manyof the reasons for excluding women which were thought weighty ten years ago,
some solid reasons still remain. Women in the Foreign Service can hardly fail,for a time, and to some extent, to be &quot; in a privileged position &quot; in the sense inwhich the witness we have quoted used the words. They will be grit in the wheelsof interchangeability, increase wastage, and so add to the difficulties of adminis-tration; and possibly create a feeling of resentment among some of their malecolleagues. But we have formed the opinion, after carefully studying all theevidence, that these disadvantages will no longer be of such dimensions, and arenot likely to be of such duration, that they should be treated as a reason for con-tinuing to make the Foreign Service an exception to the general rule of theeligibility of women for the Service of the Crown. Moreover there are now, aswe think, positive reasons for their admission. Two arguments in particularseem to us convincing. One is the argument that a New Model Foreign Serviceof the sort described in the White Paper and by its sponsors in Parliament, mustnecessarily be an imperfect instrument for the purposes claimed for it unless it includes women in its ranks, carefully chosen and trained, and working as membersof a team. We do not think that, in the new Service, this need can be adequatelymet by the work which is now done by the wives of members of the Service,invaluable though we know it to be. The other is the argument (in the words ofthe Schuster Committee) that &quot; to open the Service to women is to increase thefield from which candidates can be taken and thereby to improve the quality ofthe Service .... the admission of any section of the population, to whomentrance is at present denied, must necessarily offer a wider field of selection.&quot;This argument has been reinforced by the success of some of the temporaryappointments of women made during the war.45. We therefore recommend that women should be equally eligible withmen for admission to the Foreign Service.46. But we make this recommendation subject to one important qualification.Our belief that the difficulties consequent on women&apos;s entry are no longer likelyto be formidable or lasting depends on an assumption that the innovation will be gradual, and that the numbers who are admitted, especially in the early years,will be comparatively small. This point is so important that we have tried toform some estimate of the numbers likely to compete successfully. Data can onlybe found in the experience of the Home Civil Service. Here, over the 15 years(1925-39) during which women were admitted to the examination for the Adminis-trative Class, they gained 7 -14 per cent, of the vacancies. The first Civil service commissioner, who was good enough to go into this question for us, informed us that up to the end of 1948 there were likely to be at least 240 Foreign Servicevacancies to fill, with an additional 30 per annum (or thereabouts) for each Recon-struction year thereafter. After examining any reasons there may be forsupposing that the Foreign Service would be either more or less attractive to women than the Home, he came to this conclusion : .&apos;&apos; All this is no doubt very speculative, but I should be inclined to thinkthat it would be unsafe to assume that women&apos;s chances of success in theForeign Service competition under Reconstruction conditions were anygreater than they were in the Administrative Class before the war. Ishould therefore estimate that the number of vacancies likely to be allotted to women will not exceed 7-14 per cent, of 240, or say 17; and I should thinkthat a smaller figure, say 12-15, would be more probable.&quot;If we follow up these calculations to lengths even more speculative, andassume that a figure of about 7 per cent, will be constant, then our conclusionwill be that the proportion of women in a Foreign Service of some 700-800members will rise from about 2 per cent, in 1948 to about 7 per cent, in some35 years, or say, about 14 women at the beginning of the period and about 50 atthe end.47. If the numbers should prove to be of this order, the problem ofabsorbing women into the Service should be manageable enough. But they areguess-work; and we have considered whether the Government ought not to insureagainst the risk of the guess being wrong by imposing a limit for a time on thenumber of women entrants. Discussing this subject in relation to their experi-mental scheme, Lord Schuster and Sir James Rae said : &quot; Women should be admitted to the competition on precisely the same terms as men. We do not favour a &apos; quota &apos; system, imposing a restrictionupon the total number of women appointed to the Service in any one year,or upon the total number employed in the Service.   In our view, any such
restrictive measure is at best unsatisfactory. Either it must be ineffective,or it must operate to exclude from the Service a woman who has taken ahigher place in the examination than one of the successful male candidates.Such a result would be difficult to defend.&quot;^48. We agree with this as a general proposition. But to-day the circum-stances are abnormal. There has been no ordinary recruitment to the foreign service since 1939. There is a six-year accumulation of vacancies waiting to be filled. To allow women to compete for these on equal terms with men would beto incur an exceptional risk that they might enter in greater numbers than couldbe smoothly absorbed, and so impair their chances of making good and aggravateunnecessarily the difficulties, already great, of dealing with an exceptionally largenumber of new recruits to a service that has not yet got over the teething troublesof amalgamation. We think it would be both reasonable and prudent to limit the admission of women to a maximum proportion say 10 per cent. of the total numbers of vacancies to be filled under Reconstruction conditions. We hope andexpect that this restriction can soon be removed, and women be allowed to competefreely. But we make no recommendation as to whether the end of the Reconstruc-tion period will be the date at which this change can take place, because those with whom a decision will then rest will be able to base it on facts instead ofconjecture, and so will be better placed than we can possibly be to judge whether any limitation is still called for.49.   In conclusion, there are two further points we wish to make : &apos;(a) We are not recommending that the admission of women should beexperimental in the sense in which the schemes proposed in 1932 byLord Schuster and Sir James Rae for the Diplomatic Service and byMiss Martindale and Miss Ritson for the Consular Service wereexperimental. We think that the Service should be thrown open to women without any qualification other than the one we have suggested for the purpose of making quite sure that they do not enter inembarrassing numbers in the first few years. But it is in the natureof the case that their admission must, in fact, be part of a generalexperiment, and its results will no doubt come under review in due course; we observe that it is already proposed to review certain features of the system of recruitment in ten years&apos; time. That being so, we wish to emphasise the need to lose no time in making the experiment real. It will not be real if women are posted as ThirdSecretaries only to those countries where they are known to be alreadyfully acceptable and as Vice-Consuls only to pleasant and salubriousspots. The Foreign Office must show boldness in their diplomaticpostings and harden their hearts in their consular. It seems to usspecially important that the acceptability of women on the diplomaticside in countries classed as doubtful should be put to an early test.One witness reminded us that it is the business of the Foreign Officeto cater for a client, not to impose British views abroad. But the artof catering for a client does not consist merely of giving him some-thing that he already knows he likes; it also includes persuading himto like new things.(&amp;Y We have been dealing up to now only with the admission of women bythe main system of recruitment, that is to say the Reconstructionscheme so long as it lasts, and afterwards the two alternative methodsdescribed in paragraph 8. The initial limitation that we havesuggested relates only to those who may enter by this door. But wehave in mind that His Majesty&apos;s Government, if they should admitwomen in this way, will also treat all other doors to the foreign service as open to them; that women will continue to be eligible for temporary secondment to special posts, if that system goes on, andthat the possibility will not be overlooked that a woman might be an appropriate choice in making selections for the two special appoint-ments a year contemplated by the White Paper, or even for the appointments occasionally made of persons of distinction outside theService to Ambassadorial posts. We assume also that, if our main recommendations are accepted, the scheme for the promotion ofmembers of Branch B, the details of which are now being considered,will provide opportunities for the women members of that Branchas well as for the men.
