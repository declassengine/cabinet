(46) 78.23rd February, 1946.CABINET.POLICY TOWARDS JAPANESE  INDUSTRY.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.THE Overseas Reconstruction Committee have recently considered the futureof Japanese industry. The industrial disarmament of Japan will be one ofthe major problems with which the Far Eastern Commission will shortly haveto deal, and it is necessary that the United Kingdom representatives should beprovided as soon as possible with instructions about the policy of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment. In their approach to this subject the Committee have proceededon the principle that before decisions are taken as regards the. suppression or control of Japanese industries, the level of economic life which should be allowedto Japan should be determined. They consider that some of the difficultiesnow facing us as to the future of German industry might have been avoidedif this principle had been accepted as fundamental. With this in mind theCommittee invited the Economic and Industrial Planning Staff to make recom-mendations as regards the level of economic life which should be allowed to japan, the minimum imports and exports which should be allowed, the possibilityof controlling the direction of the Japanese export trade, and the questionwhether a reasonable standard of life for Japan would produce a dangerouswar potential. E.I.P.S. had previously submitted proposals regarding thecontrol of Japanese industry for reasons of security, and they embodied theseproposals, together with their recommendations on the questions referred toabove, in the memorandum^) which was accepted by the Committee on the11th February, 1946.(&quot;) The ground covered by the E.I.P.S. memorandum isshown in paragraphs 2-14 below.Level of Economic IAfe for J apan.2. With regard to the amounts of consumption, foreign trade and production which would constitute a restricted but reasonable level for the Japanese economy in an early post-war year, the following standards are recommended :- (i) A diet roughly the equivalent of Japan&apos;s wartime diet,  that is,1,845 calories compared with a 1936 diet of 2,140 calories,(ii) A clothing ration of 3 lb. per head, plus such silk as she is able to produce in addition to that which she can sell abroad. This ration is about three-fifths of the present United Kingdom clothing ration,(iii) A consumption of steel at the level of the early thirties. As the popula-tion was then considerably smaller than at present, this represents areduction in tonnage per head, but probably no reduction in that usedfor civil purposes. The steel consumption is put at 3-5 million ingottons, or 3-7 million tons if Japan is allowed to possess a ship-buildingindustry for the construction of ocean-going ships.The above standards would be maintained by imports of about1,300 million yen a year (at 1936 prices) and exports necessary to pay for these imports. The chief imports would be food, textile fibres, fertilisers, oil, metalsand ores and chemicals. The chief exports would be textile manufactures, rawsilk, finished metal manufactures and pottery, whilst a considerable amount of miscellaneous exports from indigenous and imported materials have been allowed for.   The methods by which the necessary balance of payments may be achieved(!) O.R.C. (46) 18. (a) O.R.C. C46), 4th Meeting, Item 1.13167   [31360] p
under the alternative assumptions that Japan has, or has not, an ocean-going-mercantile marine and a shipbuilding industry sufficiently large to build ships for that marine, are discussed in paragraph 6 of the E.I.P.S. paper.Principles and Measures of Control.3. The principles which, it is suggested, should govern the framing of measures designed to limit Japahs war potential are as follows : (a) The effect of the restrictions or prohibitions should be to make theproduction of important warlike goods impossible during the period in which the restrictions are rigidly enforced, and also, as far aspossible, to impede any effort on the part of Japan to rebuild a war potential if the restrictions should be removed or should become forsome reason or other unenforceable.(&amp;) The restrictions or prohibitions should be capable of rigid enforcementover a long period without requiring an elaborate system of controller supervision by the United Nations. Restrictions which can easily be evaded, or those which public opinion among the United nations in ten years&apos; time may cease to regard as justified, are therefore tobe avoided.(c) The restrictions or prohibitions should be limited, as far as is consistent with the realisation of security, to those which the less bellicosemembers of the Japanese ruling class could accept as being reasonable in the light of Japan&apos;s past record, and which they can be expectedto defend against attack from the surviving militarists; in other words,these measures should not be destructive of all hopes of materialprogress, and should cause as little permanent damage to the Japaneseeconomy and as little irritation to the Japanese people as is consistent with the realisation of security.4. The application of the following measures of prohibition or restriction in the interests of security is recommended : I. Prohibition of production for an indefinite period.(a) Aircraft, including civil aircraft and gliders, aircraft engines and jetpropulsion units; the spare parts of these.(b) Alumina and aluminium.(c) Magnesium.(d) Explosives of all types, all types of armaments, warships, bombs andammunition, guns and rifles, Avar gases in finished or intermediateforms, rockets.(e) Synthetic oil.(/) Synthetic rubber.It is further recommended that the ownership or operation of aircraft(including gliders) in Japan should be forbidden to the Japanese for an indefinite period, and that the employment of Japanese as pilots or as workers in aircraft factories in other countries should be forbidden by international agreement.Plants for the manufacture of ammonium nitrate and of all ultra-shortwave radioequipment (radar) should be made available for destruction or transference else-where, and the manufacture of these products should be prohibited, if efficientmeans for doing so can be devised. Limits should be placed on the import of aluminium ingots in order to prevent Japan from accumulating stocks of thismetal.II. Reduction of capacity or supply, and restriction on subsequent expansionof capacity or production beyond fixed ceiling.(a) Iron and Steel.   Japan&apos;s consumption of steel to be limited to 3-5 million ingot tons per year (or, if Japan is to be allowed to build ocean-goingships, 3 - 7 million tons, which would allow the construction of 400,000tons of shipping per annum).(b) Oil Refining and Storage.   Refining capacity in excess of that needed torefine the small home production of crude oil to be dismantled. Nocapacity for manufacturing high octane products to be retained, andthe refining industry to be restricted to the use of the straight distil-lation process. Storage capacity to be removed to the extent of leavingJapan with capacity equivalent to not more than three months&apos;supplies.
III. Reduction of capacity to amount required to meet domestic peacetime needs,but no restriction on subsequent development, except such as may resultindirectly from the controls over iron and steel consumption.(a) Railway locomotives and wagons, motor vehicles and tyres.(6) Machine tools.(c) Copper smelting.(d) Coal carbonisation.(e) Certain branches of chemical, viz., nitric acid, carbide, sulphuric acid,chlorine and caustic soda.Mercantile Shipbuilding and Shipping.5. The question whether Japan should be forbidden to build ocean-goingships is the subject of a separate paper (CP. (46) 79).Machinery of Control.6. Permanent machinery will be needed for the enforcement of the proposedprohibitions and restrictions, including the control of imports of certain com-modities such as aluminium ingots, iron ore, scrap iron, coking coal and oil. Thefollowing recommendations are made for this purpose :-(a) A small staff of inspectors in Japan, who would have the right of entering buildings where it is suspected that a breach of the prohibi-tions or restrictions is occurring and the duty of reporting any suchbreach to the United Nations Organisation.(6) Arrangements for making a periodical aerial reconnaissance of Japan forthe purpose of detecting any suspicious activities.(c) A staff of United Nations representatives located at the chief ports andattached to the Japanese customs administration.(d) A United Nations staff to supervise the exchange control system.7. No proposal has been made for the elimination of the synthetic ammoniaindustry. It is recommended for reasons of food supply that its operation,already agreed to(3) by the Overseas Reconstruction Committee in the short period,should be continued.8. Special attention is drawn to machine tools. It is recommended that capacity for their production should be reduced to the amount required to meetdomestic peacetime needs, as under category III of paragraph 4 above. E.I.P.S.have considered a proposal that the manufacture of heavy and specialised machine tools should be prohibited indefinitely, and have investigated how such a measurecould be applied. It appears that, since such a prohibition would have to beapplied uniformly to tools over a certain weight, it would have a serious effecton civilian industry and would make it impossible for Japan to attain the levelof peacetime economy postulated in paragraph 2. Enforcement over a long period would, moreover, not be practicable. No such prohibition is therefore recommended.Effect of Proposed Measures of Control on the Japanese Economy.9. The effects on the Japanese economy of the measures listed in paragraph above have been examined. It is considered that the loss of the industries to be eliminated will have a negligible effect on Japan&apos;s peacetime economy (though,of course, this takes no account of any earnings that Japan might have made fromexports of munitions). The reduction of capacity in certain industries that havebeen swollen by wartime demands to the amount needed for peacetime production(at about the 1936 level) will, in some cases, deprive Japan of the opportunityof developing quickly a large export trade in certain products, but it will not make her worse off than she was before the period of war preparation. the ceiling to be imposed on steel consumption will have a similar effect, althoughit will permit a fairly large export trade in metal goods, and the restriction on oil-refining will add slightly to Japan&apos;s foreign exchange difficulties. Theseprohibitions and restrictions taken together will not prevent Japan from attaining the levels of imports and consumption postulated in paragraph 2, nor will theyprevent her from raising those levels after a period of years.[31360](3) 0.11.C. (45) 8th Meeting, Item 3, Conclusion (1).
10. If Japan were to be deprived of her major shipping and shipbuilding industries she would lose a valuable source of income. Before the war Japanobtained from her shipping services a net income of about 230 million yen ayear, and, after allowance for her reduced level of foreign trade after the war.she could still expect to earn 100 million yen annually from shipping if she had sufficient tonnage to conduct her own trade. Onerous as these shipbuilding and shipping restrictions would be, they would not make it impossible for japan to reach the level of consumption postulated in paragraph 2. But they would makeit necessary for Japan to export a rather larger quantity of manufactured goods.To the extent to which Japan used sailing ships for carrying her foreign trade the burden of the proposed shipping restrictions would be alleviated.Safeguarding of British Commercial Interests.11. Any controls imposed on one sector of Japanese economic activity will inevitably drive her to intensify her efforts in other directions, and restrictionsdesigned to benefit one United Kingdom industry by reducing Japanese com-petition must result in increased competition with others if Japan is to attainthe standards postulated in paragraph 2.12. Suggestions have been made for restrictions to be imposed with theobject of benefiting United Kingdom exports. The most important of these suggestions are- -(i) That ceilings be established on the exports of various textile products,(ii) That control be established over the quality and specification of exportsof textile goods.Such controls would be difficult to administer and agreement could hardly bereached among the United Nations on controls designed to promote particularcommercial interests. Even if such agreement were reached it would involvea multiplication of controls to meet divergent national interests, with the consequent aggravation of the task of administering Japan. Her attainment ofthe economic level postulated in paragraph 2 would also be made more difficult.Moreover, any restriction of Japan&apos;s consumption goods industries might be inconsistent with the interests of populations of colonial territories who haveformerly looked to Japan for cheap supplies of such goods. It might also damagethose parts of the Commonwealth and Empire which have hitherto found in japan a valuable customer for raw materials, particularly raw wool and cotton.On these grounds, and since the United Kingdom and the United States are com-mitted in principle to a commercial policy intended to promote the expansionof international trade, it is recommended that -(a) No proposal for restricting development of Japan&apos;s consumption goodsindustries should be put forward; and(&amp;) The control measures to be imposed over Japanese industry, once theperiod of occupation is over, should be confined to those needed for security.13. Since no effective and practicable controls can be designed for restrictingJapanese competition with United Kingdom industry, the probable recurrence of severe Japanese competition in the future must be faced. But, even withoutcontrols designed primarily for commercial reasons, Japanese competition inchemical, metal and engineering goods will for some time to come be made much less formidable than it otherwise would be by the restrictions imposed for reasons of security, while in the textile and other industries Japan has to re-equip herplants on a very extensive scale before she can furnish even the volume of exportsrequired to maintain the standards postulated in paragraph 2. Thus the UnitedKingdom exrjort industries have, at least, a prolonged breathing-space in whichthey may be able to secure a foothold in Oriental markets.14. It has not been thought necessary to deal in this paper with thequestion of short period controls to compel the Japanese to do their part in relieving world shortages in certain classes of goods during the next two or threeyears.Consultations with the Governments of the United States and. the Dominions.15. The Committee consider that it should be made clear, in the firstinstance, to the United States Government that the overriding considerationgoverning the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Japanese industry
5111is that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to spend any money on japan. On that account it seems inadvisable to table the proposals at theFar Eastern Commission before giving the United States Government anopportunity of expressing their, views.The Governments of the Dominions are being sent copies of the E.I.P.S.Memorandum and will be notified of the decision of His Majesty&apos;s government so that their representatives on the Far Eastern Commission may be informed.Recommendations.16.   It is recommended that : (a) The level of consumption indicated in paragraph 2 should be regardedas a standard below which it would not be advisable to reduce Japan,once she has recovered from the immediate effects of the war;(&amp;) The principles that should govern the selection of measures of control to be imposed on Japanese industry (as set out in paragraphs 3-8)should be approved; and the particular measures of control that havebeen proposed in conformity with those principles should likewise be approved;(c) No restrictions designed primarily for commercial reasons and additional to those indicated in paragraphs 3-8 should be imposed on Japaneseindustry, apart from short-term measures which may be considered necessary;(d) The United States Government should be informed that it is proposed,subject to that Government&apos;s views, to table proposals on the lines set out in this paper at the Far Eastern Commission as the viewsof His Majesty&apos;s Government on the control of Japanese industry,and that His Majesty&apos;s Government are not prepared to spend any money on Japan.17. The Cabinet are invited to approve the recommendations set out inparagraph 16.E. B.Foreign Office, 23rd February, 1946.
