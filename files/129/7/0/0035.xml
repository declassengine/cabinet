Cu^jisU&amp; 2 ^ * /v this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 1946.SECRET. Copy No.CP. (46) 85.22nd February, 1946.CABINET.WEST AFRICAN COCOA.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Colonies.I should like to let my colleagues know of the situation which has arisenvis-a-vis the United States Government on proposals which I have been con-sidering for the future marketing of West African cocoa. Conditions in theWest African cocoa trade were far from satisfactory before the war, and avery adverse report on them was made by a Commission of Enquiry in 1938.During the war years it was necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government to guarantee the purchase of the entire West African cocoa crop, the actual task of marketing being entrusted to the West African Produce Control Board (aBoard appointed by and responsible to the Colonial Secretary, but containingmembers experienced in the trade and other members appointed to speak forthe native producers). His Majesty&apos;s Government pledged themselves to return the net surplus on the working of this purchase scheme to the West african colonies for expenditure on projects to benefit the cocoa producers, and a white paper issued in September 1944 announced the intention of establishing marketingorganisations in the Gold Coast and Nigeria, which would be financed out ofthat surplus and would be empowered by law to purchase the total productionof cocoa, to prescribe the prices paid to the producer, and to dispose of the cocoa.Pending the time when representations of the African producers themselves couldconstitute the majority on these bodies, it was proposed that they should carry a Government majority to represent the interests of producers and act as theirTrustees. It is my intention to encourage the development of co-operation andto use the funds available after providing for price regulation, for this purpose as well as for research, tackling indebtedness and improving the conditions ofthe producers.These proposals attracted criticism in various quarters, and alternative proposals for reforming the organisation of the trade were put forward, withthe result that my predecessor, Colonel Stanley, decided to defer the introductionof the White Paper proposals pending a further review of the situation. i made that review shortly after assuming office, ancl came to the conclusionthat our responsibility towards the people of West Africa required that weshould go ahead with the original proposals. I accordingly proposed to issue a fresh White Paper setting out in greater detail the marketing scheme whichI had in mind.This draft White Paper was shown to the State Department in view ofthe great interest of the United States as a consumer of cocoa; the State Depart-ment in reply, besides making certain enquiries and comments on details, have represented strongly that it would be inopportune to proceed with the publica-tion of this paper at the present juncture, and suggested that if His Majesty&apos;sGovernment decide to proceed on the lines outlined therein, publication shouldbe deferred until a decent interval had elapsed after the passage of the UnitedStates Loan through Congress.  This course was supported by Lord Halifax.I have therefore agreed to defer for the time being the publication of thefurther White Paper and with it the institution of the West African marketing boards. This step may be embarrassing, but my consultation with the governors of the Colonies concerned has given me ground to hope that it will be possibleto maintain present arrangements for a further season, though these will beto some extent unwelcome to African opinion.Colonial Office, S.W. 1, 22nd February, 1946.
