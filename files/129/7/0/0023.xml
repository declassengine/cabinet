THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENT:     92Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1946.SECRET.CP. (46) 73.21st February, 1946Copy No.CABINET.FIRST. REPORT FROM THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.I circulate herewith the First Report from the Select Committee on Elections,which was set up by the House of Commons on the 17th December, in accordancewith the decision of the Cabinet on the 13th December (CM. (45) 62nd Conclusions,Minute 1) authorising me to arrange for the appointment of a Select Committeeto investigate particular cases of possible disqualification for election toParliament by reason of the holding of an office or place of profit under theCrown.2. The Committee have come to the conclusion that, of the four Memberswhose cases were referred to them, Mr. Jack Jones was validly elected, but mr. Harrison, Mrs. Corbet and Mr. Awbery were disqualified under Section 24of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707. They are satisfied, however, that thedisqualifications arose purely from inadvertence, combined with the difficulty of-&apos;interpreting and applying the existing law. They recommend that the precedent of the Coatbridge and Springburn Elections (Validation) Act, 1945, should befollowed, and that a statute validating the election of the three Members shouldbe enacted. They draw attention to the risks which may be run by those whohave not informed themselves of the obligations attaching to prospectivemembership of the House of Commons.3. I see no alternative to accepting the Committee&apos;s recommendation thatthere should be validating legislation. Until such legislation is passed, theMembers concerned cannot attend the House, and it is, therefore, a matter of someurgency. Since the Committee reported, another case has, however, arisen thatof Captain Mark Hewitson, who was a member of various Trade Boards and ofa Board under the Road Haulage Act, 1938. This has been referred to theCommittee. It is, I understand, not unlikely that no action will be called for,but if the case should require legislation it would obviously be convenient that itshould be dealt with in the same Bill. I have asked the Chairman of the SelectCommittee to expedite the Report as far as possible.4. After referring to the obscurity of the present law, and the inconvenienceswhich it entails, the Select Committee go on to endorse the view of the previousSelect Committee which reported earlier in the Session that the recommendationsof the Select Committee on Offices or Places of Profit under the Crown (1941)should be adopted at the earliest opportunity; and they express the opinion thatthe repeal of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, and the clarification andre-enacting of the statute law relating to offices of profit are not only desirable buturgent. They suggest that a provision might be included in the proposed newStatute, requiring a Parliamentary candidate to sign on nomination a generaldeclaration relinquishing, and resigning from, any office of profit under theCrown which he may then hold.5. The question of legislation to give effect to the recommendations of theSelect Committee on Offices or Places of Profit was, it will be recalled, discussed by the Cabinet on the 13th December (CM. (45) 62nd Conclusions, item 1), and[31342]
the Cabinet invited the Lord Chancellor to consider it and to report to the lord presidents Committee. I understand that the Lord Chancellor will be in aposition to report to the Lord Presidents Committee very shortly and that his report will cover the general recommendations of the Select Committee on elections. No action by the Cabinet seems to be called for at this stage.6. I ask my colleagues to authorise the preparation at once of the proposed bill for the validation of the election of the Members found by the SelectCommittee to have been disqualified.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S.W. 1,2lst February, 1946.

FIRST REPORTThe Select Committee appointed to examine any cases which may be broughtto their notice of Members of this House who may have been incapable of election to this House by reason of the fact that at the time of their electionthey held offices or places of profit under the Crown within the meaning ofSection 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707 ; and to report whether any such Member was on that account incapable of election to this House,and, if so, what course should be adopted in any such case : Have madeprogress in the matters to them referred, and have agreed to the followingFirst Report : 1, PreliminaryYour Committee have held five sittings, and have examined four Membersof the House whose names were brought to the notice of Your Committee bya letter from Mr. Attorney General, which indicated that they may have held offices or places of profit under the Crown within the meaning of Section24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707. These Members were Mr. Harrison,Mrs. Corbet, Mr. Awbery and Mr. Jack Jones. In addition, Your Committeeheard evidence from Sir Frank Soskice, K.C., Solicitor General, and fromSir Gilbert Campion, K.C.B., Clerk of the House of Commons. Memorandafrom the Minister of Labour, Mr. Attorney General and the Secretary of thePensions Appeal Tribunals, relating to the offices held by the four Membersat or about the time of their election, were submitted in evidence.2. Your Committee propose first to examine the cases of the four Membersaffected by the inquiry, and then to report certain recommendations arisingfrom these cases.3. The Case of Mr. James Harrison, M.P.Mr. Harrison was appointed by the Lord Chancellor a part-time memberof a Pensions Appeal Tribunal under the Pensions Appeal Tribunals Act, 1943.The Schedule of the Act provides that members of Tribunals &quot; shall be paid. . . such remuneration as the Treasury may determine &quot;. Mr. Harrisonattended only three sittings of a Tribunal, all of them before the date of the poll, i.e., on 22nd September, 1944, 9th January and 9th April, 1945. Foreach attendance he received a fee of thirty shillings, and no expenses were paid. Mr. Harrison&apos;s evidence established that he lost in wages more than he received in remuneration. On the 17th October, 1945, he wrote to theSecretary to the Pensions Appeal Tribunals a letter in the following terms :-&quot; It had been my intention of resigning from the panel of CD. lay membersof the Tribunals before, so please accept my resignation . . .&quot;This was acknowledged by a letter from the Secretary dated the 23rdOctober, 1945, reading : &quot; I have received your letter of October 17th tendering your resignationas a lay member of a Pensions Appeal Tribunal. Please accept my thanksfor your services.&quot;Mr. Harrison&apos;s appointment was by letter dated October 29th, 1943, andwas for an indeterminate period. As a matter of law, therefore, it appearsthat both on July 5th and July 26th, 1945, that is, Polling Day and the dayof the declaration of the result, Mr. Harrison was still the holder of the appoint-ment.SELECT COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS 9^
4. The Case of Mrs. F. K. Corbet, M.P.Mrs. Corbet was appointed a part-time assessor to sit with an Umpire todeal with hardship cases under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, 1930,her appointment being made under Section 6 (3) and Part II of the Scheduleto the Act, and the remuneration payable to her being provided for underSection 6 (10) [a) of the Act. As such, she became a member of a panelconstituted by the Minister of Labour and National Service for the purposesof the Act, and was liable for selection by the Minister to sit as an assessorwith an Umpire to deal with appeals from a Military Service (Hardship)Committee. The appointment was made by letter dated 31st May, 1943,and was, in the first instance, for one year until the 31st May, 1944. On the13th May, 1944, however, a further letter was written inviting her to continue in her appointment &quot; for the period ending 31st May, 1945 and, unless theMinister determines otherwise, for such longer period as may elapse before afurther appointment is made&quot;. This further appointment she accepted,and this was an appointment which would only expire when &quot; a furtherappointment is made &quot;. It was not legally determined before the GeneralElection in July, .1945, though Mrs. Corbet had not served or received feessince 1943, when she received eight guineas for two attendances.5. The Case of Mr. S. S. Ai&amp;bery, M.P. &apos; .Mr. Awbery was likewise appointed to the panel of assessors to the Umpireunder the National Service (Armed Forces) Act, 1939, on the 11th February,1943. His appointment was, on the 12th February, 1944, extended &quot; for theperiod ending 28th February, 1945, and unless the Minister determines other-wise, for such longer period as may elapse before a further appointment ismade &quot;;This extension of his appointment was accepted by Mr: Awbery. On the21st July, 1945, Mr. Awbery wrote to the Minister of Labour in the following terms : &quot;As a Parliamentary candidate I understand that it is necessary.that. I should relinquish my position as member of the National Service FlardshipCommittee.   I therefore ask you to accept my resignation &quot;.The Ministry of Labour replied to this letter on the 21st August, 1945; asfollows: &quot; I am directed by the Minister of National Service to refer to your letterof the 21st July ... I am to say that in view of your subsequent electionas a Member of Parliament the Minister feels that he must accept yourresignation as assessor to the Umpire under the National Service Acts . . .&quot;By his letter of the 21st July, 1945, Mr. Awbery asked the Minister to accept this resignation.. . If, however, his appointment was &quot; unless the Ministerdetermines otherwise, for such longer period as may elapse before a furtherappointment is made &quot;, it may be considered that his letter amounted to no more than an offer to terminate his appointment sooner than it would, under its terms, come to an end ; since in accordance with its terms it could onlyend when a further appointment was made or the Minister decided that itshould before the making of such further appointment come to an end.Unfortunately, Mr. Awbery&apos;s offer was not accepted by the Minister untilthe letter of the 21st August was sent. It seems, therefore, that in law bothon July 5th and July 26th, 1945, Mr. Awbery was still the holder of theappointment, though the last of several attendances by Mr. Awbery was inJune 1944.   Fees and expenses paid amounted to about  30.
6. The Case of Mr. Jack Jones, M.P.Mr. Jones was appointed Chairman of a Local Appeals Board set up underSection 5 (4) of the Essential Works (General Provisions) No. 2 Order, 1942(S.R. &amp; 0. 1942 No. 1594). His appointment was dated 1st October, 1943, andwas for the period ending 31st March, 1944, &quot; and unless the Minister deter-mines otherwise for such further period as may elapse before another appoint-ment is made &quot;. Mr. Jones served on eighty occasions and received about &quot;210 in fees and expenses, the last occasion being in July, 1944, twelve months before his election. On the 3rd July, 1944, Mr. Jones was further appointed,but never served, as Chairman of a Reinstatement Committee set up to dealwith questions arising under the provisions of the Reinstatement in civil employment Act, 1944. This appointment was until the 31st March, 1945,&quot;and for such further period as may be determined &quot;. On 28th July, 1944,Mr. Jones was adopted as a parliamentary candidate, and on 30th July, 1944,he conveyed by telephone to the Ministry of Labour&apos;s regional office his verbalresignation from both appointments. In his evidence Mr. Jones told your committee that the regional officer accepted that verbal statement, and hewas never summoned to attend further. In August, 1945, Mr. Jones wrotethat owing to a misunderstanding on his part he was under the impression that he &quot; had intimated informally last year that he intended that his retirementfrom the Chairmanship should date from the last session over which he hadpresided ...&quot; On the 5th September, 1945, a letter was written from theMinistry to Mr. Jones in the following terms : &quot; It has just been brought to Mr. George Isaacs&apos; notice that owing to a misunderstanding it was not realised that you wished to relinquish yourappointments as Chairman of a Local Appeals Board and ReinstatementCommittee . . . following your adoption as a parliamentary candidatelast year. The Minister now accepts your resignation with effect from the31st August, 1944, in accordance with your wishes . . .&quot;In this case Mr. Jones&apos; evidence was that his verbal resignation was verbally1 accepted by the regional officer, on behalf of the Minister, before 5th July, 1945,I the date of the poll.i 7. ConclusionYour Committee&apos;s conclusion on the four cases submitted to them, after full consideration of all the evidence, is that Mr. Harrison, Mrs. Corbet and; Mr. Awbery held offices or places of profit under the Crown within the meaning of Section 24 of the Succession to the Crown Act, 1707, at the time of their: election, and were on that account incapable of election to this House. Youri Committee are of opinion, however, that the resignation of Mr. Jack Jones\ from his office was effective before 5th July, 1945, the date on which the poll\ was taken, and that his election was valid.8.    The House has already received the report of another Select Committee;on Elections which was set up earlier this session to consider the cases of two[Other Members of the House whose elections were held to be invalid withinthe meaning of the Act of 1707.   In its report that Committee said : &quot; The two Members have convinced Your Committee that their services- . . were undertaken purely from public spirit and in no way for profit.In fact they may have been out of pocket as a result of their workEn the three cases at present under review the same considerations are applicable.Bn no case did any Member serve or receive any fee after the date of the polkf^our Committee are satisfied that their disqualification has arisen purelyfrom inadvertence, combined with the difficulty of interpreting and applying the existing law. Your Committee therefore recommend that the precedentI    4s5.1-! A 2
of the Coatbridge and Springburn Election (Validation) Act, 1945, should befollowed, and that a statute validating the election of the three members should be enacted.Your Committee also consider that it is appropriate to call public attentionto the risks which may be run by those who have not informed themselves of the obligations attaching to prospective membership of the House of commons. Recommendations arising from the Committee s conclusion the conclusion&apos; regarding the four cases submitted to them would beincomplete without certain qualifications to which Your Committee attach great importance. On several occasions in recent years, when the questionof a Member holding office has arisen, the Select Committees inquiring intothe circumstances have been handicapped by the obscurity of the present law. It is not sufficient to consider the facts of each case in relation to theprohibition contained in Section 24 of the Statute of 1707. A long investigation into the obscurities and ambiguities of phrase of the Succession to the CrownAct, on which the highest legal opinion often differs, has been necessary inrelation to every case. The present inquiry demanded the attendance ofMr. Solicitor General on two days to help the Committee in examining whatthe Attorney General rightly described in his memorandum as &quot; questions oflaw of the utmost difficult and uncertainty &quot;. In a busy session, some timein both Houses has already been devoted to the passing of one Bill of Indemnity,and the introduction of a second Bill has now to be recommended ; whileYour Committee&apos;s terms of reference suggest that their duties may not yet be at an end.For several months, moreover, first while their cases were under examination,and now while they await the possible introduction of legislation, the Househas been deprived of the service of those Members who may have inadvertentlyjeopardised their seats.10.    Your Committee have in no way lost sight of the importance of theprinciple which underlies the prohibition of office-holding by Members, namely,the need of ensuring a free and independent House of Commons.   But themischief against which the Statute of 1707 was aimed office-holding and consequent loss of political independence is remote from many of the cases which arise to-day.   None of the Members affected by the present inquiry!for example, had any intention of either sitting or taking payment for sitting!on any board or tribunal after the date of their election.   Their service onlsuch boards or tribunals before the date of election was undertaken purelyBfrom public spirit.   With the recent growth of administration by statutoryBbodies composed of part-time members, the maintenance of the Act of 1707 Iin its present form might well discourage from this new form of public service Iany person who might eventually contemplate seeking election to Parliament, Iparticularly since the penalties against office-holding may be inflicted even Ifor nomination to a statutory panel without any actual service or payment. IFor these reasons Your Committee are of opinion that it is essential for the present law to be re-defined in order that the circumstances under which a IMember may be disqualified should be immediately ascertainable.11. The previous Select Committee on Elections, which reported earlier Ithis Session, urged that the important recommendations of the Select Committee Ion Offices or Places of Profit under the Crown, 1941, should be adopted at the Iearliest  opportunity.Your Committee are in entire agreement with this recommendation ;and are of the opinion that the repeal of the Succession to the CroW act, 1707, and the clarification and re-enacting of the statute la&quot; Irelating to offices of profit is not only desirable but urgent.
/12. In addition to endorsing the recommendations of the Select Committeeof 1941, Your Committee suggest that a provision might be included in theproposed new statute, requiring a parliamentary candidate to sign onnomination a general declaration relinquishing, and resigning from, any officeof profit under the Crown which he may then hold. This general declarationmight be drafted so as to be legally effective forthwith, or to be conditional upon election. Such a declaration would, of course, only guard against candi-dates-holding office by inadvertence&apos;ar&quot;the-time&quot; Of thgif election, and not against the case of a Member, who inadvertently accepted office after election,for which the Report of 1941 suggested an appropriate procedure.11th February, 1946.
