91-HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C g E TCP. (46) 72GOVERNMENT INFORMATION services memorandum by the First Lord of the AdmiraltyParagraph 3 of the covering note by the Chairmanof the Official Committee on Government information services to C.P.(h6) 5h implies that all publicity wouldbe handled by the G.I.O.        I feel it is essential that service Departments should have  the right to preparetheir own publicity material, the G.1.0.  acting as adistributing agent as appropriate.      I do not considerthat the G. 1.0.  should exercise any controllingfunction over Service publicity.2. It is also my view that at least one service department should have full membership of the official committee on Home Information Services,  so that when general publicity is being discussed, due considerationmay be given to Service views and problems.      Whicheverof the  three- Service Departments was representedaould,  of course, iteep the other two fully informed.20TH FEBRUARY.   19U6COPY NO.CABV.A.Admiralty,Whitehall,S.W.120th February,  19h7.
