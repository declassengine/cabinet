KESTRiCTEDDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(76) 7820 September 1976CABINETHEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ACT: SAFETYREPRESENTATIVES AND COMMITTEESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. On. 9 September the Cabinet deferred for further consideration my proposal to make regulations and approve a code of practice givingrecognised trade unions the right to appoint safety representatives and tooblige employers to set up safety committees.2.        The matter was also debated at the Trades Union Congress (TUC)and my colleagues will know that the TUC has conveyed to me the strongly held views that failure to act on the Health and Safety Commission^proposals would throw doubt on the Governmenfs readiness to implement the Employment Protection Act.    Payment for time spent by union officials on matters other than health and safety would involve far greater cases andthe TUC would regard the Governmenfs action on this matter as highlyrelevant to their general relations with the Government.    The TUC are primarily concerned to see the regulations laid before Parliament - the operative date is of less importance to them - but if Ministers are unableto agree to implement the Commission^ proposals, the TUC wish to discussthe issue with the Prime Minister.3.        hi the light of this development I have considered the alternative courses put forward at our last meeting.DEFER ACTION FOR FOUR WEEKS TO CONSULT LOCAL authorities on THE POLICY AND FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS4b.       The objective of this suggestion would be to convince localauthorities that the financial and staffing implications are much less thanthey fear.    The Commission and I believe that the higher estimates of thepublic sector costs are indeed much exaggerated given that unions in thepublic sector already spend a fair amount of time on health and safety;that they will not wish to appoint large numbers of untrained safetyrepresentatives and the training resources of the TUC and individual unionsCOPY NO1
are severely limited; and that in most cases the time spent by individuals on these matters will be so small as to be swept up in their normal workload.    I see little hope, however, of persuading localauthorities of this by further discussion in the abstract.    The only wayforward here is, by laying the regulations, to open the way for groundlevel discussions between them and the unions on the actual operation ofthe regulations in their areas.EXCLUDE LOCAL AUTHORITIES (INCLUDING EDUCATION) and national HEALTH SERVICE FROM THE REGULATIONS OR FIXLATER OPERATIVE DATES FOR THESE SECTORS5.        The TUC would undoubtedly react most unfavourably to totalexclusion and to the inference that unions in these parts of the public sector should have less right to be involved in consideration of health and safety matters affecting their members.    If it is maintained that existing consultative arrangements in these sectors are adequate, there1b no reason to assume that the regulations will precipitate large changesor significant extra costs.6.        The argument that these are generally low risk sectors ofemployment ignores the fact that they contain some high risk areas andany attempt to devise a phased introduction by category of risk generallyposes great practical problems.    It would be difficult to define such areasin the regulations and, if this was nonetheless done, employers would face the problem of having, at an/ one time, some parts of their establishmentssubject to the regulations and others not.LAY THE REGULATIONS WITH A LATER OPERATIVE DATE7.        This course is more attractive.    The Commission have proposed a lead-in period of four months between the making of the regulations andtheir operation, but the provision of a longer period could be presented asallowing more time for necessary discussions between employers and unions about the operation of the regulations in their particular circumstances and the resolution of any differences.    I should find this alternative approach acceptable provided that the operative date was notdelayed beyond 1 September 1977.MARE REGULATIONS TO OPERATE FROM MARCH 1977 AND EITHERSUPPLY LOCAL AUTHORITIES WITH AN EXTRA  10 MILLION THROUGHRATE SUPPORT GRANT in 1977-78 OR STATE GOVERNMENT LIMIT on public EXPENDITURE TO IMPLEMENT THE REGULATIONS8.        In practice there may be little difference between these two courses,but setting a limii for the public sector as a whole is more likely to suggest a general restriction of implementation of the regulations and to excitecriticism of the Government for apparently discriminating between the2
public and private sectors.    On balance therefore I still favour the first of these courses which is what I proposed in my earlier paper (CP(76) 73)and which would be related to the first year of operation,   ha that periodwe would monitor developments and then be able to review future requirements much more accurately in the light of the experience we atpresent lack.recommendation . it is absolutely essential to make progress with these regulations and to do so in a manner acceptable to the TUC,   Although I still favourmy original proposal I am prepared, if my colleagues remain opposed toit, to accept the alternative of laying the regulations with a delayedoperative date not later than 1 September 1977.   Unlike the otheralternatives to my original proposal we know that the TUC would find thisacceptable.A BDepartment of Employment20 September 19763
