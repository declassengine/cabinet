UMENT B THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 89 COPY NO      G118 October 1976CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT 1977-78Memorandum by the Secretary ox State for scotland. The Secretary of State for the Environment&apos;b paper deals with england and Wales, but the Cabinet will presumably expect similar action inScotland.   I accept that the grant percentage should be cut, but I believe the extent of the cut must be related to what we think the average increase in rates ought to be.2.        Although this depends to some extent on the rate of grant we fix, the balances - if any - which local authorities expect to carry into 1977-78 willbe just as important: and these in turn will be estimated according to authorities&apos; revised expectations of the rate of Inflation over the whole of1976-77,    We have, of course, publicly revised our own expectations.    I appreciate the strength of the case for adhering to the published cash limit on the amount to be made available under the Rate Support Grant (RSG)Increase Order: this is a matter still to be considered but if we were todecide to adhere to the cash limit on the Increase Order, local authorities will Buffer as a result through reduced balances or increased deficits at thebeginning of 1977-78.   Most of the Scottish authorities adopted in their budgetsour estimate of a 7 per cent allowance for inflation: the latest calculationssuggest that this should be about&quot; 10 per cent overall, representing additional expenditure by Scottish local authorities of the order of  19 million.    this additional expenditure, at least, cannot be blamed by us or the localauthorities.3*        On the following assumptions:a. That this year&apos;s actual overspend on current account will be such, taken along with the effects of inflation, that virtually all ofthe excess budgeted for will In fact be spent so that little In the wayof balance e will actually be available at the end of the year,b. Inflation next year at a rate of 10 per cent.c. Expenditure in 1977-78 at White Paper levels.1
d.        Domestic element at this year1s level.The following cuts in percentage points of RSG produce average domesticrate increases in Scotland as shown on Column B,    Column C takes what I regard as possibly a more likely outcome, namely that next year&apos;s budgetswill be broadly at the same level as this year&apos;s.RSG: Percentage Points Cuts1234 -5&apos; -B1316202327C26303337414. The question for ue to consider is what level of rate increase we candefend in terms of the  social contract.5.        In suggesting that we approach the matter in this way I would emphasise that:-a. An &quot;^average&quot; rate increase covers wide variations, andbncause the Press will publicise the highest, the impact of rateincreases on public opinion.will be exaggerated.b. For reasons explained above I see no proopec^, at least InScotland, of explaining a cut in the sise of the grant by reference tonotional balances in the hands of local authorities at the end of1976-77 in respect of failure to comply with Cmnd 6393,6.        We should not underestimate the implications of the attitude whichthe local authorities have taken in Scotland.    I have continued to press themvery firmly on the need to reduce expenditure but they have become increasingly resentful of what they see as the Governments insistence onunrealistic levels of expenditure.    They say that the savings we want wouldinvolve substantial redundancies - at least 10, 000 next year - and, while I regard mis as overstated, such cuts as have been attempted have met strongtrade union opposition.   The resentment of the authorities will be increasedwhen it becomes clear that I do not intend to discriminate, in the distributionof RSG, in favour of authorities which have appeared to make greaterefforts to reach the guidelines which we issued.    There is a real danger ofa breakdown in co-operation between the Convention of Local Authorities andthe Scottish Office if we are too insensitive to the feelings of the localauthority members.2
7.        In my view there la a real danger that local authorities who see separately increase of say 25 per cent as Inevitable, despite what they consider tohave been on their part a determined effort to keep expenditure down, may decide that cuts are not worth the trouble Involved for them, that very largepercentage increases should therefore be accepted, and that the sheer size of the Increases will make it easier to blame the Government for what is happening.    This is precisely what occurred in Scotland in 1975 and couldoccur again if we are thought to be acting unreasonably,8.        For this reason my view is first that if we were to decide to stick tothe present cash limit on the Increase Order for this year, despite increasedinflation, we must take that into account when we fix the rate of grant for next year.    Depending on the decision on that, I would favour limiting thefall in grant to no more than li-2$ percentage points as being the most likely to be both defensible to the public and effective in reinforcing theefforts of local authorities to reduce their revenue expenditure; and so far&amp;a concerns Scotland I would link this with an Increase in the domesticelement,B MScottish Office18 October 19763
