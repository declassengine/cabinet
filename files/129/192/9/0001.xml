DOCUMENT B THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY *S government cp(76)84 copy no    2118 October 1976CABINETH OUGHT ON COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL AID TO POLITICAL PARTIESMemorandum by the Lord President of the council I. This paper contains proposals for handling the report of the HoughtonCommittee which reported on 26 August,2,        The Annex to this paper contains a summary of recommendations bythe majority of the Committee.   The remaining four members - a third ofthe Committee - came down against any subvention to the Parties butapproved the majority&apos;s scheme as the best available if it were decided thatgrants should be paid.    Copies of the full report were circulated withCP(76) 71.3.        In evidence to the Committee the Conservative and NationalistParties opposed the principle of aid to political Parties from public funds,and their representatives on the Committee signed the minority report.They have reaffirmed this opposition since the report was published.   TheLabour Party has made clear that it stands by its original view that financial support should be provided, but not all our supporters in the commons share this view.    The Liberal Party favours support in principlebut there are differences of view on the acceptability of the Houghtonschemes,   Cfciniojijnay^be^*t*iiaeTr*4.       General public reaction to the report has been mixed.   Initial press comment was mainly hostile but there have been some more favourableopinions since,5.        My own view is that the report makes out a sound and convincing case for the policies that it recommends; that we should move towards theIntroduction of legislation to implement it; and that, in order to removeuncertainties from the forward planning of the Parties, we should aim tocarry through this legislation as soon as possible.    There are obviously a variety of ways of providing financial aid but I think we should take advantageof the cover provided by the minority report and stick in general to theparticular schemes evolved by the Committee,   Whether some of thedetails ought to be varied is a matter we should leave over until the stage ofimplementation,
6.        The Committee put the cost of their proposals at about  2^ million ayear on average.   Amounts in particular years would, however, depend onthe incidence of elections and the totals would be increased in time by theexpenses of candidates for the Scottish and Welsh Assemblies and theEuropean Parliament.7.        Clearly if we are to go ahead with legislation we must decide how the additional funds are to be provided.    This would be a new form ofGovernment expenditure and would either have to be found from savingselsewhere (as I imagine the Chancellor of the Exchequer may wish) or count against the contingency reserve.   We shall moreover have to decide whetherpayments to local government candidates come from local funds, centrallysupported, or direct from the Government.    Either way the additionalspending may not be welcome to local government against the current back-ground of stringent controls.   A decision will also be needed on ministerial responsibility for running the schemes,8.        Given the political background it is difficult to predict with confidencethe fate of any early legislation to implement the Committee^ main recommendations.    The Bill might be lost and, If so, we could hardlyreintroduce it for a fair time to come.    In any case, there is a risk that,even though only a short Bill would be needed, argument might hold upessential measures in our legislative programme.9.        I accordingly propose that rather than move direct to legislation weshould put down a Motion for debate in the Commons proposing endorsement of the Committee&apos;s recommendations.  It might still be possible for this tobe taken in the spillover period.    In moving the Motion I would make itclear that the Government were disposed, subject to the views of the House,to accept the report as it stands and to introduce legislation accordingly.10.       If the Motion were carried we would proceed to prepare a Bill whichmight be introduced later next Session.   A certain amount of inte r depart-mental work would be needed to get the details right.    If, however, the motion was unsuccessful or there was any consensus of criticism on particular aspects we could decide to defer action meantime or to proceedwith a modified scheme (eg one confined to reimbursement of candidates&apos;expenses).11.        I seek the agreement of colleagues to the course advocated inparagraphs 9 and 10.m rPrivy Council Office18 October 1976
annex report OF THE COMMITTEE ON financial aid TO POLITICAL PARTIESSummary of recommendations we recommend the introduction of a system of state financial aid for political parties in the United Kingdom.Such aid should take the form of:i. annual grants to be paid from Exchequer funds to thecentral organisations of the parties for their general purposes,  the amounts being determined according to theextent of each party&apos;s electoral support;ii. at local level, a limited reimbursement of theelection expenses of Parliamentary and local governmentcandidates.In order to qualify for a grant a party must at the previousgeneral election have either:a.     saved the deposits of its candidates in at least sixconstituencies;or     b.      had at least two of its candidates returned as members;2E     c.     had one of its candidates returned as a Member, and received as a party a total of not less than 150,000votes.The amount of the annual grant payable to each of the qualifyingParties shall be calculated on the basis of 5p. for each votecast for its candidates at the previous general election.Tbe scheme for the limited reimbursement of candidates&apos; election expenses should apply to all Parliamentary elections, and to allelections for county and district councils in England and Wales,regional,  island and district councils in Scotland, and theGreater London Council and London borough councils.
Reimbursement should be restricted to those candidates whoat least one-eigth of the votes cast,  and the amount to be reimbursed should be the candidate&apos;s actual election expensup to a limit of half his legally permitted maximum expenditPayment shall be made directly to the candidate.It is recommended that the first payment of the proposed anflgrants payable to the parties should be on 1 April 197?, andthat the scheme for the limited reimbursement of candidates&apos;:election expenses should operate, for all Parliamentary andrelevant local government elections held on or after 1 april*1977.The total cost of state aid to the political parties underproposals is estimated at, on average, about  2J million &amp;Of this,  the annual grants to the parties would comprise a&amp;0 1,440,000 and the reimbursement of candidates&apos;  election expenses approximately  800,000 a year (including  360,000in respect of Parliamentary candidates and  500,000 for loo&apos;go ve government n t can di dat e s).It is proposed that the reimbursement schemes should be ex*to include elections to the European Parliament and to theScottish and Welsh Assemblies as occasion arises.
