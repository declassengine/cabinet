...ANNEX ARESTRICTED -PREPARATIONS FOR THE PRESIDENCYThe main course of the preparations has been as follows;i. Consultations began with the Irish and Italian Presidenciesduring 1975 and with the Luxembourg and Dutch Presidencies thisyear.   Advice has also been taken from the Secretariat of theCouncil of Ministers with whom we shall work closely during theperiod.ii. The booklet giving guidance for Ministers on the conduct of meetings of the Council of the European Communities has been revised and reissued.ill.   Preparations to accommodate meetings in London, mainly atLancaster House have been and are co-ordinated by the FCO&apos;s 1977Conferences Unit (responsible also for the NATO Ministerial Keetingand the Meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in May and june 1977)   and by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&apos;sPresidency Secretariat.iv.   A Presidency Secretariat has been established within theForeign and Commonwealth Office both to handle Presidency aspectsof Community business and to be responsible for the running ofPolitical Co-operation during this time.   Political Co-operationfalls outside the ambit of the treaties, and since there is no permanent Political Secretariat the main administrative burden,borne in the case of Community business by the Council Secretariat,falls to the Presidency.   There will be a large number of PoliticalCo-operation meetings at all levels held within the United Kingdomand the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Presidency Secretariat willprovide support for these.- 1 -
