DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVERNMENT81CP(76) 100 COPY no. 8 November 1976CABINETTHE e.c. UNIFORM PASSPORTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs, When this subject was last discussed in Cabinet on 11 June, it wasdecided that I should seek to negotiate with our European partners theadoption of a layout of the front cover of the passport which would place the name of the issuing State and the national arms above the mention of the European Community, as in Design D among those I circulated(sample enclosed).2.        Since then there has been considerable argument among the NineMember States in Brussels on the layout of the cover and we have now reached the position where all Member States except Germany are preparedto place the name of the issuing State above the words European Community.Even the Germans in the Council on 18-19 October said they had an openmind.    This represents a distinct negotiating success for us, sinceoriginally the United Kingdom was alone in resisting the reference to theCommunity being at the top of the cover.    Seven Members are prepared,some of them reluctantly, to accept a variant put forward by the Frenchwith the following layout: -Name of the Issuing StateEuropean Community(Design X)state  s armsPassportThis variant is, of course, not identical with Design D, the only model theCabinet authorised me to accept.    But it does meet our principal objective of having the State mentioned before the Community.   Again, although itplaces European Community above the Royal Arms, I would myself regard this layout as acceptable provided the Arms are displayed prominently in the
centre of the cover.    There is little hope of getting the other Eight tosupport the original layout and I think that this new formula is within thespirit of the Cabinet&apos;s conclusions.3.        In the Council on 18-19 October the Irish proposed that the referenceto the Community should be in tho form &quot;Member of the european community&quot;.    If this were to attract majority support, the United kingdom should, in my view, go along with it,4.        On the question of the use of languages the Cabinet decided that theUnited Kingdom should maintain the existing international practice, wherebyissuing States use their own language plus English or French, though it wasagreed that the United Kingdom need not object to the Germans and theItalians using each other1 s language in their passports if they so wished.At the present stage of our discussions the Germans are in an isolatedposition in that they want all the Community languages to be used in the passport.    Only the United Kingdom now wants to follow the existing international practice: most of the other Member States are willing toaccept a compromise put forward by the Dutch Presidency.    This would preserve the existing practice of individual Member States except that an index page in all seven languages of Member States (including Irish) wouldbe added.   This index would refer to numbers placed against each of theentries on the &quot;control&quot; pages of the passport.    The Presidency compromisedoes the least damage to existing international practice that we are likely tobe able to negotiate, if agreement is also to be achieved on the design of theuniform passport.    It is preferable that the United Kingdom should bealigned with seven partners on the basis of a Presidency compromise thanthat we and the Germans should find ourselves directly opposed.5.        The third major item on the uniform passport still requiringagreement is that of the form of resolution.    The Presidency have proposedthat the Act instituting the passport should take the form of a resolution adopted jointly by the Council of Ministers and by representatives of governments of Member States meeting within the Council.   France hasmade clear her preference for a resolution of Member States meeting withinthe Council, but has indicated that she might be willing to accept the compromise as part of a package.    It should be our objective to minimise the transfer of competence to the Community on this issue, although we can scarcely deny that the Council of Ministers has a role since it was theEuropean Council in Rome in December 1974 which charged the council with devising the uniform passport.    I would like to accept the Presidencycompromise while seeking to ensure that the text of any resolution limits the actual transfer of competence, which should at this stage be confinedstrictly to the form of passport.2
6.      I seek my colleagueb&apos; agreement that I should be empowered to:-a. Accept the layout of the cover in Design X,b. Accept the proposal that the reference to the community on the cover should be in the form &quot;Member of the european community&quot;, if this finds general support.c. Accept the Presidency compromise on the languages to beused in the passport.d. Accept the Presidency compromise on the form ofresolution.A foreign and Commonwealth Office8 November 19763
