DOCUMENT * THE PROPERTY OS HER BRITANNIC MABBTYW government copy NO       c.p.(76) 85 0 A18 October 1976CABINETCASH LIMITS 1976-77Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. Cash limits for this year were set out in a White Paper on cashlimits (Cmnd 6440).    We are now coming to the point at which we must decide whether the limits are to be made to stick.    Our provisional policy was set out in paragraph 19 of the White Paper.    This noted that &quot;If the rateof inflation were to turn out substantially higher or lower than that which hasbeen allowed for, the Government would have to take stock of the position inthe light of all the circumstances of the time&quot;.    But it also gave a clearwarning that &quot;spending Departments will not be able to rely, as they have inthe past, on supplementary provision if this would take their total provisionfor the year beyond the cash limits&quot;.    Thus everyone was warned at the outset mat supplementary provision could not be relied on.GENERAL APPROACH2.        We now have to consider whether we need to modify this approach.On the one hand, as I said in the economic debate last week, inflation in1976-77 is likely to be somewhat higher than we had hoped at the beginning ofthe year - due mainly to commodity price rises and sterling depreciation.On the other hand, the pay policy has been held, and the large number of cash limits which mainly comprise wages and salaries should therefore beunaffected.    Moreover, there Is a wide body of opinion which regards theapplication of cash limits as important evidence that expenditure is being brought under effective control; and any relaxation in the limits wouldsimilarly be widely interpreted as a serious relapse.3.        I am sure that our general approach must be to make cash limitsstick and to consider easements only in a limited number of exceptional cases.   At a time when we have taken action on interest rates in order tokeep the money supply within limits, and when working people are being asked to stick with the pay policy, we must show that the Government sectorla not exempt.    More over c the intention was that cash limits should be seennot merely as a bulwark against cost inflation but as a discipline onprogramme managers.    There are some grounds for hope that they are
having this effect.    It would be unfortunate to weaken the impact of thisdiscipline when we are only halfway through the very first year of theoperation,SPECIAL PROBLEMS4.        Nevertheless, there are a number of special problems which must beconsidered on their merits.    In particular, there are a few cash limits witha significant proportion of costs incurred directly in foreign currencies,some of which are firm International commitments which cannot be varied inthe short term,    I agree that these cases must be looked at.   But even inthese cases, I propose that there should be no increase in the cash limitswithout first applying every possible means of absorbing the extra expen-diture.LOCAL AUTHORITIES5,        In the Rate Support Grant circulars of last December, before the cash Limits White Paper had been published, local authorities were told that &quot;a cash&apos; limit is a predetermined limit on expenditure, expressed in cash terms, which will not normally be revised to take account of changing circumstances during the year&quot;.    They were also told that &quot;if the pace of inflation generally or the rate of cost Increases affecting local authority expenditure were substantially higher than those implied in the cash limits,the Government would be prepared to review the position in the light of allthe circumstances of the time&quot;.   At present there is no evidence to suggestthat the rate of cost increases affecting local authorities is in factsubstantially higher than was implied in the cash limits.    Moreover,throughout this year, we have been conducting a sustained effort to keeplocal authority current expenditure in real terms within the levels indicatedin the February White Paper on public expenditure.    To exert financialpressure on them to do so, the Government has indicated that it will reducethe Rate Support Grant below what it would otherwise have been by 50 million In England and Wales and by  5 million in Scotland (the latterreduction Is still to be announced).   We know that even these efforts arelikely to be insufficient to prevent some excess over the White Paper levelsthis year.    It would run completely counter to these efforts to consider any increase in the cash limits on the Rate Support Grant; and it would surely bea mistake to weaken the effect of our Inadequate range of instruments forrestraining local authority current expenditure,    I believe that the force ofthese arguments applies as much to Scotland as to England and Wales,conclusions.        I ask my colleagues to agree with the following conclusions:-
i. Our general policy must be to hold expenditure within theexisting cash limits, and Departments must plan expenditure on that basis.11.        We should be prepared to look at a limited number of special problems, such as those referred to in paragraph 4 above, but weshould not concede any increase in a cash limit without first applyingevery possible means of absorbing the extra expenditure.ill.      I should take an early opportunity to state publicly our generalintention to make the existing cash limits stick, and that in thosespecial cases where an increase cannot be avoided, every effort willfirst be made to absorb the excess.D W treasury Chambers&amp; October 19763
