DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 10515 November 1976CABINETMINISTRY OF DEFENCE DISPERSAL TOCARDIFF AND GLASGOWMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal the purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the wider consider-ations which arise from the paper by the Secretary of State for Defence,CP(76) 104.THE GOVERNMENTS COMMITMENT2.        We have a clear commitment to carry out in full the dispersalprogramme announced in July 1974, and to complete it within the ten yearswe have set ourselves,3. The Ministry of Defence dispersals to Cardiff and Glasgow (11, 000posts) represent over one third of the whole programme (see Annex).   Anychange of plan at this stage would be profoundly damaging and would strike at our credibility in the assisted areas.     Over the past two years ministers have repeatedly given, in Parliament, to local interests, and to the scottish and Welsh Trades Union Congresses (TUC), firm assurances that the moveswould go ahead.    In a letter of 9 July 1976 to the Lord Provost of Glasgow,the Prime Minister wrote:  &quot;I am glad to have this opportunity to reaffirmto you that the Government remains fully committed to the dispersal pro-gramme announced in July 1974&quot;.   As recently as 3 November I myuelf saw the Lord Provost, at his request, and assured him of the Governmentscontinued resolve.REGIONAL policy.        Dispersal is a vital aspect of our regional policy; not only for the short term relief of unemployment but also, in the longer term, to redressthe present imbalance in job opportunities between the South East and the older industrial areas.    The transfer of high quality work, as in the Ministryof Defence, will be particularly worthwhile in this respect.    These pointshave been repeatedly stressed by representatives of the receiving areasthemselves.copy NO81
DEVOLUTION5.        To cancel or defer the Ministry of Defence moves would be seizedupon by our opponents in Scotland and Wales, particularly the Nationalists,to cast doubt on our commitment to devolution.    Particularly in the light ofrecent National Staff Side statements, it would be cited as yet another example of &quot;Whitehall&quot; furthering its own interests at the expense of the national interest.COSTS AND BENEFITS6. The Civil Service Department has carried out a detailed up-to-datecosting (at 1976 prices) of the dispersal programme as a whole.    This showsthat, following completion of the programme in 1984-85 at a total net cost over the implementation period of  57 million, there will be continuingannual savings of at least  50 million in each subsequent year.    In addition there are the important regional economic and social benefits.7. Because the Ministry of Defence dispersals take place towards the endof the ten year programme, their break-even point necessarily falls later thanthat for the programme as a whole.    Nevertheless, the Ministry of Defencefigures show that the Property Services Agency&apos;s savings attributable to itsdispersals, when fully realised, will amount to nearly  19 million a year(1976 prices).    Furthermore, the greater part of the cost falls outside thecurrent Public Expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) period.THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE POSITION8.        There appears to be no problem discussed in the Secretary of State&apos;s paper which significantly differentiates his Department from other dispersingDepartments, or makes it a special case.9.        The paper suggests that, because of economies stemming from theDefence Review, public expenditure cuts, and the current Management Review,the Ministry of Defence will have exceptional difficulty in meeting its commit-ment.    The 1974 statement accepted that the Department^ numbers fordispersal might be affected by the Defence Review, but it mentioned no otherfactor which might bear on Ministry of Defence numbers, and otherDepartments have been subjected to expenditure cuts and management reviews.In my view, the marginal amount by which the Ministry of Defence might reduce its numbers should be considered further in details.CONCLUSIONS10.       I invite my colleagues to agree that:-a.    the Ministry of Defence moves to Cardiff and Glasgow should go ahead as announced in July 1974;2
b.    the Secretary of State for Defence should be invitedto present any proposals for a reduction in dispersalnumbers to the appropriate Ministerial Committee.PCivil Service Department15 November 19763confidential
