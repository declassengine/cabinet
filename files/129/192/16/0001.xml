PUliLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY 1976Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury-&apos;     We have taken and announced our main decisions on expenditure programmes in 1977-78.    We now need to settle the expenditure programmes for later years to be included in the forthcoming public expenditure White Paper.2*     There is an important difference between these two sets of decisions.    The decisions for 1977-78 are needed as a basis for financial control in the coming year, and will be translated intocash limits and Supply Estimates.    For 1978-79, and even more forthe later years, the decisions will bo provisional and subject to confirmation in later Surveys.    However,  in present circumstances*t is particularly important that we should be seen to be keepingto the expenditure plans which we published last February in Cmnd.6393; and this is essentially a matter of dealing with the remainingadditional bids.3-     As far as 1977-78 is concerned, we shall need in the white paper to show that we have achieved a net reduction or the amount^ich we announced in July, while retaining a contingency reservelarge enough to cope with all the problems which are likely toCt*nfront us between now and the end of March 1978.    I have alreadyifidiCated in my last progress report on the contingency reserve(cp(76)79) how stiff a task this will be; and some of the issues^ntioned in this paper (notably on housing and selective assistanceto industry) affect 1977-78 as well as the other years of the survey period.   The purpose of the present paper, however, is to set outtJ*e matters which we need to settle for the later years.    For theseJfears, the attached report by the Treasury brings up to date the^terial circulated in July, taking account of the effect on the later years of the measures we have already announced, and indicatesth-e main decisions which still have to be taken.The Treasury report shows that the decisions which we announced1(1 July only yield a relatively small net saving in the later years,
&apos;&apos;&apos;tome of which is absorbed by the fact that we have not identifiedCivil service staff savings as big as those for which credit wantaken in Cmnd GJ95.   ^he expenditure already included in the Surveyis very close to Grand 6395 levels, without counting any of theremaining additional bids.   Any net savings from 1978-79 onwardsWhich dp arise from the July decisions must therefore be retained for meeting the most pressing additional bids, and cannot simply beadded back to tne programmes concerned.   Even with this very smallextra margin, however, it is clear that virtually all the additional. bids need to be absorbed or offset if we are to keep ;/ithin our broadexpenditure plan.5*     The report divides the bids into a number of categories, whichare listed separately in Tables 5-7 of the report.   Table 3 coversitems which can be left for the time being as a claim on the contingency reserve.   Table 4 covers bids which are estimating changesin major programmes where the outturn is not precisely controllable-Table 5 includes those additional bids which relate to local authoritycurrent expenditure.   Tables 6 and 7&apos;include all other additional bids.- I set out below my proposals for dealing with all these differentcategories, but the main issues arise on Table 6.* ^able 36,     Contingent items.    Table 3 of the Treasury Beport lists some additional bids which may need to be considered in due course, but&apos;, which for one reason or another do not need to be provided explicitlyin the expenditure programmes in the forthcoming White Paper.   Porthe time being, therefore, they can be left as potential claims on&apos; the contingency reserve.    They do however underline the need tomaintain a contingency reserve of an adequate size.   V&apos;e cannot solveour problems by raiding the reserve now in order to provide for- additional bids.   There is no.scope for more than a quite marginalreduction in the reserve Vnich w-?s pii^c-sted in the Public P:c,;o--&quot;i i-.--cSurvey Co:r.committee (PZSC) Report, nnd I v;ould ruch prefer to naintrinthe full reserve which is shown there.^7,     I have discussed with the Defence Secretary his additional bid or up to  175 million on the Defence Budget for 1980-81.   We are^agreed that as; there are major uncertainties affecting that year
Ma,ior demand-determined services.    The two services - social^cunty and export credit re-finance - which are shown in this table are similar in that, unless we make major policy changes,the expenditure will for the most part depend on the demand for the***viceB ana the state of the economy.10-   In the case of social security, there are no policy issues forCofcsideration now; but estimates of the cost of the programme in**ey terms are sensitive to changed expectations about the numbersbenefit, while estimates of the cost in real terms are affected^ the rate of inflation.    Because of the volatility of the figures,not think it right in ^ly to take into account the additionalement shown in the Survey figures for 1977-78.   The programmeU Qow being recalculated using more recent data on the factors which1 *ave mentioned but without at this stage changing the SurveyGumptions about future levels of unemployment.    On this basis^Uainary indications are that the recalculations will show an1 did*e1uir;ional requirement only in the last year of the Survey.   For**e time being the Survey figures have been left unchanged.    It willNecessary before the White Paper to settle the presentation of the06Paaune in the light of the most up-to-date estimates available.(eg over our preGence in Cyprus) a decision should be deferred at*bis stage. The 1980-81 Defence Budget figure in the White Paper*ill therefore he as for 1979-80, but described as provisional.8&quot;     We have also agreed to treat as contingent the bids for the costs of MOD staff dispersal to Glasgow and Cardiff and for thecOBts of expanding the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR). defence secretary reserved the right, however, to reinstate the former as a*irm bid, depending on the outcome of consideration of the wholedispersal issue (see paragraph 22).   He is not pressing the UDR bidbut has pointed out that the Defence Budget is already bearingother costs of Northern Ireland peacekeeping in excess of thoseflowed for in the Defence Review, and that he may eventually be0bliged to request extra resources for these and the UDR.
In the case of export credit re-finance, v;e have negotiated anagreement with the banks under which they wi.l 1 provide a greater^proportion of the outstanding credit from their own funds.   Thebenefit to public expenditure from this new arrangement will however. accrue largely in 1977-78.   Policy for the longer term is currentlyunder review, and I ant sure that we must seek ways of keeping this element of public expenditure under better control.   Until decisions have been taken, however, it will be necessary to include in theVhite Paper the latest available costing, which is shown in Table 4of the Treasury Report.Table 512.   Local authority current expenditure.   We ere discussingseparately the figures to be used for the rate support grant (ESG)settlement in 1977-78.   We are already committed to sticking to the levels of current expenditure published in Cmnd 6393*   The forthcomingpublic expenditure White Paper must be consistent with this, except to the extent that agreed switches have been made between local- authority capital and current expenditure.    But we have yet to decide how best to avoid over-spending or whether we are prepared to takewhatever measures would be needed to achieve this.. 1J.   We have to recognise in any case that, as we do not at presentdirectly control local authority current expenditure, the local&apos; -authorities may spend more than we publish in the public expenditureVhite Papers.    If they do, this will impose some charge on the contingency reserve, but I hope we can minimise this risk in 1977-78&apos;.14.   For the later years also ve should continue to keep to theCimd 6393 levels, subject only to agreed switches between capital-and current expenditure, and possibly with some minor adjustment forthe special problems connected with expenditure on the police service.This weans that we would not at this sta^e make provision for l\-cadditional expenditure listed in Table 5, hut would seek by all*.Bieans at our disposal to ensure that the local authorities keep as-^close as possible to the plan which we published last February.
COIft1IHENTIALlVblc.6.     ^/Wr. other nddi tionnl bids15&apos;    Housing.    Interest raU.-s are now substantially above those.assumed in the Survey, and must be expected to regain go in the foreseeable future.   This, coupled with reduced expectations on public sector rent increases, has resulted in substantial additionalbids in the English housing programme, amounting to nearly  .200 million in 1977-78 and above  /lOCMi50 million in later years.   The criticaldecisions to be taken are whether a larger part of these increasedhousing; costs can be met from revenue, or by rinding compensation^tingsavings from within other parts of the housing programme; otherwiseoffsetting savings would be required in other programmes.    Somesavings could be. found by encouraging local authorities to cover a larger part of their bousing costs fron rents.    The additional bidsassume tlict there id. 11 bo increases averaging GOp a week in 1977-78and 1978-79, and in line with the consumer price index thereafter.Within, existing legislation, increases of 75-80p a week would hepossible1; and we co*vld plan for significant increases in real termsthereafter, though the policy and legislative constraints will need to be reviewed in the context of the Housing Policy -Review.16.   Tho room for other savings on housing in 1977-78 has been ereduced by the measures in July.    Nevertheless, it would be possibleto offset the additional bids by a combination of measures - reductions in mortgage lending and iGunicipalisation; holding now housebuilding atthe current monthly level of approvals; and trimming the very largelocal authority work and housing association programme&apos;a.;;es.    In 197S-89and la^cr years, the additional bids could be offset by action onthe same programmes of comparable severity to that announced in July.The t.&apos;ible below summarises the present provision for expenditure onthe various elements of the English housing programme from 1977-78onwards, eycludxnfi the additional bids discussed above.  million (197G Survey prices)1977-75   1978-79   1979-80   1930-61Subsidies (including rebates)	15&amp;5	1222	1250	1250Wow ho asebuild ing	1217	1292	1286	1286Sales	-62	-154	-154	-154Mortgage Lending (gross)	100	260	261	261Improvement Grants	72	112	112	112Improvement investment	298	320	320	320Hi i * d c i ia 1 i s p. t i o n	110	155	155	155Housing Associations (net	409	425	438	Other (net	1	8	26	26&apos;i&apos;otal	3510	36^1-0	3694	
1?.    The Welsh housing programme-presents a special problem.    ?)-?:Secretary 6f State for Wales has represented to me strongly tK-\tthrough historical accident the Survey figures are seriously inadequateby comparison with the English housing programme and Welsh housing needs.    I am in sympathy v.&apos;ith the argument, and am willing to :;gr:eethat the  20 million which Cabinet agreed in July should be added tothe Welsh housing programme in 1977-73 should also be added to thebaseline figures for later years.    But the whole of the additionalbids both for 1977-78 and for 1978-79 and later, should then be accomodated within the revised baseline figures.^8.   Health.   There are additional bids in all three years for extracosts arising from new public holidays, in the last 2 years for additional expenditure on nurses1 training (the Briggs Report), andin the final year also for increases to meet projected demographic/demand growth and to provide for a continuing margin of improvement(some  21 million) in methods of treatment.    I do not think we can afford any of these bids in present circumstances.    In particular,the Briggs proposal, to which there is no specific commitment, shouldbe postponed; the cost of the holidays should be absorbed; and resources for improved treatment should, if necessary, be found by reallocatingpriorities in the final year.   As I have already explained, the on-        1*   going savings after 1977-78 which accrue from the decisions we announced in July for increased charges and recovery of accident treatment costsfrom vehicle owners, are needed to provide room for manoeuvre in public expenditure as a whole.   They are not therefore available tomake room for additional expenditure within the health programme.It follows also, of course, that local authority expenditure on personal social services (see Table 5) should be contained strictlywithin the Cnnd 6393 limits.19.   Energy.   A number of additional bids have been put forward onenergy programmes or energy-related European programmes.    Althoughindividually they are relatively small, they amount in total soover  50 million in each year.   Having examined them carefully, X -think we will need to make provision for additional funds for theJoint Research Centre (provided agreement is reached in the Europeandiscussions before the White Paper is settled), end for pit closure;,the redundant mineworkers payment, scheme, and early retirement benefit for coal miners.    The fuel efficiency loan scheme has not proved
successful, and I do not think we need provide funds for it afterthe end of 1977-78.    The Lids for coal stocking aid, Nuclear R &amp; Dand the Joint European Torus could regain for the time being aspotential claims against the contingency reserve.   On the first,the extent of the requirement is uncertain, and on the others, it is unlikely that a final decision wil]  have been taken &quot;before the white paper needs to he finalised.20.    Thanes barrier,  etc.    The MAFF bids in Table 6 are mainly con-cerned with the revised estimate of the cost of the Thames barrierproject, which has already begun.    In bilateral discussion these estimates have been further revised and to some extent offset bylower provision for land drainage schemes; but subject to thosechanges I con see no escape from making provision for the increased costs.    The estimate for food stocks has been reduced.    I am exploringthe possibility of additional savings to cover the remainder of thisbid.21.    Maternity Fund.    We axe already committed by a provision in theEmployment Protection Act to the setting up of a Maternity Fund, andI think we will now need to make provision for this in the expenditure white Paper.22.    Dispersal.   A number of additional bids have been received forthe cost of dispersal plans for different departments.    In view ofthe total cost of this programme, colleagues may wish to reconsider the case for deferment until our economic situation had substantiallyimproved.   Meanwhile I propose that any additional costs should be absorbed in programmes or left as a claim on the contingency reserve.Table 723.    Other additional bids.    As the Treasury Report shows, there area number of other additional bids, which the Cabinet will notnecessarily want to review in detail.    In order to make progress onthese I have examined them myself individually, and will be discussingthem with the Ministers concerned.    I hope that a considerable numbercan be either absorbed or deferred, but in the overall arithmetic wemust make some allowance at this stage for those which need some additional provision.    I do not propose that provision should be made
in the forthcoming White Paper for the remaining items.   If any jlprovision is required for those later, it will need to be considered has a claim against the contingency reserve in competition with any        other claims which may arise. . iiiSelective assistance to- industry \24.   The Treasury Report mentions the separate review which is being done on expenditure on industrial support.   We shall he discussingthis initially in the ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial \Policy, but our final decisions on it must have regard to the overall constraints on public expenditure.    I consider that we mustrelate any additional expenditure on selective assistance to the !.amounts which can be found by savings on general assistance, such as    !ithe regional employment premium and regional development grants, j.1since the only alternative would be to find savings in other j;expenditure programmes.Conclusions25. As I said at the outset, it is essential that in our next public :expenditure White Paper we should be seen to be keeping to the planned ylevel of expenditure in Cmnd 6393. The extent of the Government&apos;control over the outturn on different elements in the expenditure programmes varies considerably, and we cannot therefore be over-precise in the comparison; but it is essential that we should beable to validate the claim that we are sticking to the plans in cmnd 6393 (to the extent that it is possible, under the newpresentation we have agreed, to compare like with like). Table 1Aof the Treasury report shows that (omitting nationalised industryinvestment for the reason I have just mentioned) there is at present only a very small margin between the.new Survey figures and Cmnd6393, of the order of  100 million in 1978-79 and rather more than half that amount in 1979-80. Under the proposals I have made above,there would be no net increase in the Survey figures in respect ofthe contingent items (Table 3) or local authority current expenditure(Table 5). The provision to be made for the major demand-determinedservices (Table 4) has not yet been finally established. For the items in Tables 6 and 7* however, sums might need to be provided as followse

If, however,the other additional bids were not offset, so that there was ademonstrable upward shift in the total level of expenditure, we should need to look at the possibilities of finding expenditure savings inother areas.26.    I therefore invite my colleagues to approve the proposals whichare set out in paragraphs 6 to 25 of this paper.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE - THE 1976 SURVEYReport by the TreasuryIntroduction1,      Decisions have been taken and announced on changes to theexpenditure programmes for 1977-78.   It is now necessary to decide the complete programmes to be shown in the public expenditure white paper for all years to 1980-81.2.      For this purpose, the Survey figures have been brought up todate, to include all decisions announced before the summer Recess,as well as some further estimating reductions.   The picture is summarised in Tables 1A and IB, which compare the February white paper (Cmnd.6393)* the PESC Report, and the latest position.3-     The further discussions on the Survey will need to take account of the decision.which has been taken by Ministers on thenew presentation of the nationalised industries.   This will havetwo effects on the Survey figures: the exclusion of capital investment by these industries, and the inclusion of figures forgovernment financing of the industries.   When we come to makecomparisons between the next White Paper and Grand.6393, it will bepossible to take account of the first of these; but it will not bepossible to take account of the second, since no-one can now say what financing figures would have been put in Cmnd.6393 if we had then been using the new presentation.4.     For the purpose of showing whether any new figures are withinthe Cmnd.6393 totals, therefore, the only way the comparison can bemade is to exclude nationalised in&amp;istry capital investmententirely.   This is what has been done in Table 1A.   However, as thecapital investment will still be shown in the supporting materialat the back of the White Paper, it will be possible for anyone tomake the comparison with Cmnd.6393 on the old basis, or for Members
of Parliament to ask for it.   Table IB therefore shows the comparison on the old basis of presentation (but excludingprovision for the likely requirements of BNOC, BritishShipbuilders and British Aerospace).5.      It will be necessary, as a separate exercise, to decide whatfigures should be included, under the new presentation, for theprovision of government finance to the industries.   This is being pursued separately by the Treasury with the departments concerned,and the outcome will be put to Ministers in due course.   As itwill not affect the comparison with Cmnd.6393, the remainder ofthis paper is concerned primarily with the problems which will need to be resolved in respect of programmes other than the nationalised industries.The new Survey base-line6.      The main differences between the new Survey base, irv Tables1A and IB, and the PESC Report arise from the July cuts and thecivil service staff savings.   The first of these produces someconsequential savings in the later years.   The second, however,works the other way, since the staff savings so far identified donot make up the full amount for which credit was taken in Cmnd.6393.7.      The expenditure cuts announced on 22 July were aimed atreducing the deficit in 1977-78.   Some of them, however, had an automatic effect on later years.   In some programmes, the cutsrepresented a net saving after taking account of additional bids,some of which also had automatic effects on later years.   the returns by departments of the net effect of the decisions announced on 22 July on total programmed expenditure at present add up to thefollowing:-  million (1976 Survey prices)1977-78   1978-7J   1979-80   1980-81Programmes other thannationalised industryinvestment -793 -98 -92 -73Nationalised intkistryinvestment (Programme 5)      -157 -Total programmes -950 -98 -92 -73
8.     The proposed savings in civil service manpower costs ( 140 million in 1978-79 at 1975 Survey prices) were shown in the February white paper (Cmnd 6593) as a lump-sum deduction, not attributed to programmes.Decisions on the implementation of these savings were announced on29 July.   However, the announced savings fell short of those shownin Cmnd 6393-   The relevant figures are shown below.  million (1976 Survey prices)	1977-78	1978-79	1979-80Seduction indicated in Cmnd 6393	62	175	162Savings so far recorded	47	106	103Balance	15	69	599.     We clearly cannot continue to show the balance of the globalreduction in the Next White Paper, since this would only highlightthe fact that not all of the savings have yet been found.   Unlessfurther staff savings are identified to make up the full amount,total expenditure will therefore be higher than envisaged in cmnd 6393* and this excess will need to be offset by reductions inother expenditure.10.    Selective assistance to industry.   In the course of the discussion on 1977-78, the Cabinet agreed that there should be a review of ways in which industrial assistance could be made more selective, forexample by channelling more of it through the National EnterpriseBoard.   A report by officials has been prepared which sets out two alternative levels of additional provision for selective assistance and identifies possible savings which might be made to offset it.The amounts involved are:  million&apos;1977-79     1978-79     1979-80   1980-81Expenditure:   Case A 62 79 105 110Case B 68 120 184 219Possible savings(i) Abolish REP in DAs from1.10.77 or 1.1.78 16-32 65(ii) Abolish REP in SDAs from1.1.79 - 26(in,) Modify coverage ofassisted areas(iv) 5% cut in RDGs in DAsfrom 1.1.78 12 50figures in cash for not, Development Agencies, and REP; in 1976 survey prices for other items.1^ . 365	65105	10525-50	25-5050	50
This report is expected to be considered by Ministers shortly beforethe Cabinet resume their discussion on the Survey. No provision hasbeen made for the possible outcome in the present paper.11.   Contingency reserve.   In Table 1A, the contingency reserveincluded in the new Survey base from 1978-79 onwards is the same asthat included in the PESO Report.   For 1977-78, the last reportcirculated to Cabinet on the state of the reserve showed that it hadalready been reduced below that level by decisions already taken.   TheWhite Paper will however also need to take account of estimatingchanges on some programmes (eg social security) which may furtheralter the picture.   It will anyway be necessary to include in theWhite Paper, for each future year, a contingency reserve which appearslikely to be viable during that year, and from that standpoint thefigures suggested in the PESO Report were by no means excessive.   Whilethe ultimate size of the reserve to be published will need to beconsidered when decisions have been taken on expenditure programmes,it is convenient, as a working assumption, to continue to allow inthe later years for a reserve of the size shown in the PESO Report.12.   Shortfall.   Cmnd 6393, like previous public expenditure white papers, included a general deduction for shortfall, amounting ineach of the later years to  250 million at 1975 Survey prices.Total public expenditure (excluding debt interest) in that white paper was therefore correspondingly lower than the figures for    &apos;Cmnd 6393 in Tables 1A and 1B.   However, the outturn of some elements in public expenditure is substantially affected by variations in demand for the service, and may therefore be subject either to short-fall or to over-runs in any one&apos; year.   A margin of tolerance has tobe allowed for programmes of this kind, but in the nature of thingsthe net effect of over-runs and shortfall for public expenditure as awhole cannot be predicted for future years.   It is proposed therefore to discontinue the projections of net shortfall, although in any year there will inevitably be some variation from the planned total.   to reflect this change of practice, this report excludes the previousshortfall deduction entirely from the comparison with Cmnd 6393; itdeals only with the expenditure programmes and the contingency reserve.
13-   Debt Interest.   Debt interest is not a programme on which, assuch, Ministers have to take decisions.   The size of the public ^debt,and the interest payable on it, is rather a reflet&quot;-1 :o.i of the wholecourse of the economy as well as of Ministerial decisions on economicand financial policies; but at the sane time the resulting size of debt interest and its financing has to be taken into account in assessing the total cost of public expenditure.   The Treasury Reportcirculated by the Chief Secretary in July indicated that new debt interest figures would be calculated for the next White Paper,according to the assumptions which seemed most realistic when thetime came.   The interim revision, calculated last summer, suggestedsome scaling down.   Developments since then include higher interest rates, which tend to raise the amount involved in money, terms, but,a somewhat worsened expectation on inflation which tends to reducethe burden of debt interest in real terms.   In addition, the changedpresentation of the nationalised industries in the public expenditure figures calls for a fresh look at the treatment of the debt interestto which their borrowings give rise.   The full implications of this,which may be substantial, have still to be worked out, and will be reported to Ministers collectively before the final figures for theWhite Paper have to be settled.14.   General assessment.   The figures in Table 1A show that the totalsof the new Survey base are broadly similar to those in cmnd. 6393-   Thenew Survey figures fall short of Cmnd 6393 by  105 million in 1978-79and  61 million in 1979-80.   However, in accordance with the ground-rules approved by Cabinet, all proposals for increases, unless theyhave been fully offset, have not been included in the Survey base but have been identified for decision as additional bids.   If the nextWhite Paper is to show expenditure totals consistent with Cmnd 6393,Table 1A implies that the great bulk of these additional bids will thus need to be withdrawn or offset.15.   Bilateral discussions have therefore been held to explore how far the remaining additional bids could be deferred or offset by savingswithin the programmes concerned.   These discussions have been useful inidentifying offsets in some cases, but most of the additional bidsstill remain for consideration by Ministers.   (In those cases whereagreement could be reached in the preliminary discussions at official level, the net changes were taken into account in the new Survey base in Tables 1A and 1B,)
16.   Additional bids.   The additional bids from 1978-79 onwards whichare still outstanding after the preliminary official discussions are summarised in Table 2, in the following broad categories.17.   First (in Table 3). there are some bids which are still contingent,and therefore have to be noted as potential future claims on the con-contingency reserve, but which do not need to be considered at this stagefor inclusion in programme totals.18.   Second (in Table 4). there are the major programmes on which, once the policy has been fixed, the annual outturn of expenditure is recognised to be not precisely controllable, but is mostly dependenton the demand on the service and the state of the economy.   For these programmes, the additional bids consist of a revised estimate ofexpenditure in the light of the relevant economic and other factors.Particularly for the later years these estimates are necessarilyuncertain and liable to change.   The two major programmes of thiskind for which additional provision is needed in at least one of thethree years covered by this report are social security and exportcredit refinance.   In the case of export credit refinance&apos;, the policyis currently under review.   In the case of social security theprogramme is still being recosted on the basis of revised estimatingassumptions and for the moment the survey figures are unchanged.   Itwill, however, be necessary to settle their presentation in the white paper in the light of the most up-to-date estimates available.ibn  innn)tiiin 7nT1- &quot; -----J-       1 ^-p&apos;1 iTftl - *4fl&quot;riB fiTT til&quot;aeiiUtuaul lamilmuiuuUu tn bath jgufeiumuigp.19.   Third (in Table 5). there&apos;are a-number of additional Mdsrelating to local authority current expenditure (other than housing).The bids are listed under the functional programmes concerned since this is the way in which expenditure is presented in the Surveys and white Papers.   The level of local authority current expenditure, andits distribution between services, is not directly controlled by central government and is ultimately determined by the actions ofthe individual local authorities.   The Government can however seek to influence its level both generally and on particular services, bymeans of policy guidance and by decisions on the level of grant.
20.   It seems clear that local authority current expenditure is nowrunning at a higher level this year than was planned in Cmnd 6393-This implies that next year authorities will have to cut theirspending well below present levels if they are to keep withinCmnd 6393 limits.   It will be very difficult to persuade authoritiesto do this; and, apart from agreement to some switching betweencapital and current expenditure, firm decisions have not yet beenreached on the action which the Government will take.   However,they have indicated that they cannot increase the Cmnd 6393 figures;and if expenditure can actually be reduced to that level in 1977-78,it is not unrealistic to assume that it could be held to the Cmnd 6393levels for later years also.21.   Fourth (in Tables 6 and 7). there are the remaining bids whichhave been analysed by reference to the responsible departments.Table 6 contains the larger items, and Table 7 the remaining smalleritems, which will be settled bilaterally as far as possible.22.   From the figures in Table 6, it appears that the main issues which Cabinet will need to consider are the following:-(a) Substantial bids for additional expenditure on Housing(b) Bids for the National Health Service, partly to carryforward into 1980-81 the demographic/demand growth provisionapproved by Cabinet for the years to 1979-80, and partly forfurther improvements.(c) A number .6f bids for additional expenditure on Energyprogrammes, mainly Nuclear R&amp;D, contributions to Europeanenergy projects, coal stocking aid, and the continuation ofsome other expenditure on coal mining already approved forearlier years.(d) Revised estimates of the cost of the Thames barrier and strategic food stocks.(e) The proposed provision for the new Maternity Fund set up under the Employment Protection Act.(f) Additional bids in a number of programmes for meeting thecost of the dispersal programme.confidential
