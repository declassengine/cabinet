document is the property of her britannic majestvs government cp(76) uo copy no ^119 November 1976CABINETRHODESIA: THE BRITISH ROLE DURING THE INTERIM PERIODMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs, Assuming that Mr Richard can persuade the Patriotic Front atGeneva to move on to the question of the transitional government, we shallbe faced with what has always seemed likely to be the crunch point: whether there should be a British constitutional presence during the interim period and if so what its nature should be,2.        Under the 1923 and 1961 constitutions Southern Rhodesia has asubstantial measure of self government, but Britain has ultimate responsibility for defence and external affairs.   Although there is no rule of domestic law or constitutional principle that would oblige Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to provide a British presence in Southern Rhodesia as part of asettlement, the ability of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to dissociate theUnited Kingdom wholly from what happens there is circumscribed in law by our obligations under Article 73 of the United Nations Charter regardingdependent territories, and in fact by public opinion In that country which willnot permit us to wash our hands of the whole matter.    Moreover,successive Governments since 1965 have recognised our continuingresponsibility.    For example, Harold Wilson said at the time of theUnilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) &quot;if the legally constitutedgovernment of Rhodesia were to seek help In dealing with law and order,naturally we would have to give ft the fullest consideration (Hansard,12 November 1965, col 538),3.        It is becoming clear, from Presidents Nyerere and Kaunda, from the rhodesian nationalists at Geneva and from other African sources that thefundamental question which decides whether or not the Conference breaksdown will he the nature of the British constitutional presence during the interim period, ie whether it should be purely symbolic or something more.The Africans insist on something more because of their total and fundamentaldistrust of Mr Smith.    They want some guarantee that he will not be able,by retaining control of the defence and security forces, to frustrate any1
agreement which la reached.    They believe that only a Britishconstitutional presence, which is more than purely symbolic, can providethis guarantee and prevent his wriggling off the hook,4,        If our refusal to consider something more were to break theconference, the consequences would be starkr Britain would everywhere beblamed.    In black Africa, we should lose all goodwill and influence.    Weshould suffer badly in the eyes of our European partners.    Our relationswith the United State s would be seriously damaged at what is (for other reasons) a most critical moment.    There would be a rapid escalation of theracial guerrilla war, leading certainly to outside intervention (eg SouthAfrican and Cuban) on both sides.    In the process Rhodesia would bereduced to a shambles,    hi other words, everything which it has been ourand Dr Kissinger&apos;s object to avoid would with absolute certainty occur.5.        What prices are we willing to pay to avoid this catastrophe ?   Thequestion is whether there is a degree of British involvement which Africanswould accept as the minimum which they require but which was also themaximum we could accept.6.        I rule out absolutely the following:a. That we should send British armed forces to Rhodesia,b. That we should provide a cadre of British officials to assumeexecutive responsibilities.c. That we should assume, through the constitutional presence,direct and sole responsibility for the maintenance of law and order.d. That we should maintain our constitutional presence in rhodesia if the interim government broke down.7.        Moreover any involvement would be made subject to the following conditions:a. Guerrilla activity Bhould cease, as soon as agreement hadbeen reached at Geneva,b. Sanctions should be lifted upon the legalisation of the interim government,c. The cost of the constitutional presence would be wholly a charge on the Rhodesian budget.8.        If those conditions were met, there would be minimal risk in ouragreeing to provide a purely symbolic constitutional presence, and in agreeing to chair a Lancaster House -type conference to put the seal on an
independence constitution.    But the Africans would certainly regard this aswholly inadequate to meet their needs,9.        The something more which we might concede could be that:i. The British representative would play an active role in thenegotiations on an independence constitution, whether as an informalintermediary or as chairman of the constitutional discussions in rhodesia,ii0        He would resume the ultimate responsibility for external affairs which Britain exercised under the 1961 constitution.ill.      He would also resume the pre-UDI British responsibility for defence and assume an ultimate responsibility for the&apos; internal security forces.     By ultimate responsibility I moan, for example,that:a. He might have a veto over dismissals and appoint&quot;ments to a range of senior posts in the Rhodesian armed forces, and Police,b. He might have the power to convene on his own initiative a meeting of Ministers and senior officials if a major threat to law and order developed and he might possiblyexercise a casting vote in their deliberations.10.       In discharging the tasks in iii, above, the British representativemight well be assisted by a group of Commonwealth advisers.    Moreover weshould make these concessions conditional on agreement at Geneva either onthe allocation of the executive portfolios of Defence and of Law and Order ina Council of Ministers (if this was the sole organ of government below theBritish representative), or on the attribution of executive responsibilities inthese fields to a Council of State (if such a council were established over theCouncil of Ministers).11.        If an interim constitution provided for a Council of Ministers but not for a Council of State, the British representative could discharge thefunctions envisaged as a Resident Commissioner.    If there were a two-tier system, he could discharge his functions as chairman of the Council of State.12.       It would be tempting to suggest that we could limit our Involvement by providing that the British constitutional representative should be answerablenot to London for his actions but to the interim government.   But this wouldnot satisfy the Africans.    Moreover it would deprive us of the right towithdraw him as and when we wished.     We should need to give him ageneral instruction to work for a rapid and orderly transfer to independenceunder majority rule but not make him subject to day-to-day instruction^,
13.       There can be no absolute guarantee that the offer of a Britishpresence as outlined in paragraph 8 above would prove the catalyst for agreement at Geneva.    If Mr Smith decides he needs an agreement, he willprobably accept it.    It is less certain that such an offer would meet therequirements of the nationalists.    But empowering Mr Richard to make It,at the moment which ho judged appropriate, would be the best way of avoiding a breakdown, with all the consequences described in paragraph 4,14.       There is, of course, the danger that we could be faced with pressure to accept a still greater degree of involvement, but the best way of meeting this is to make absolutely clear at the start the limits beyond which we willnot go and the conditions which we attach to our offer.    The &quot;slippery slope&quot;argument applies continually to great affairs of state.    My answer is that ifwe refuse to go this far, world opinion will condemn us with virtualunanimity.    If we go this far but refuse to go any further, while there will still no doubt be pressures, the bulk of responsible world opinion will judgethat we have gone as far as we reasonably can.15,       If my colleagues can agree on this proposal, we stand a fair chanceof breaking the deadlock in Geneva, and of getting increased co-operation from the African Presidents in ensuring their helpful influence on thenationalist delegations.    Above all, this proposal could provide the key toan eventual agreement.    This would be a vast gain for mankind.16.       If my colleagues cannot agree, then we must seriously considerwhether we should not allow the conference to fail now on the Issue of thedate for independence, or on some other issue for which the blame couldbe more readily pinned on other parties,A foreign and Commonwealth Office19 November 1976
