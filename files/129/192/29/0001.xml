DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(76) 104 COPY NO      8115 November 1976CABINETMINISTRY OF DEFSNCS DISPERSAL TO CARDIFF AND GLASGOWMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DefenceINTRODUCTION1, The recommended &quot;efficient&quot; solution for the Ministry of Defence(MOD) in the Hard man Report on the Dispersal of Government Work from london (Cmnd 5322) was 11, 000 posts to be dispersed to Milton Keynes: theHardman &quot;regional&quot; solution recommended 6,218 posts for Cardiff and4,672 posts for Milton Keynes.    In the event, the Government announced on 30 July 1974 the plan to disperse 5,000 MOD posts to Cardiff and 6,000 to Glasgow.2,        My predecessor reserved hie position on the sise of the disperal to each location in the event of the Defence Review having a significant effecton the size and shape of the Ministry and the  Lord President of the Councilacknowledged this factor in the original Parliamentary statement.Subsequent planning has related the timetable for the moves directly to thecompletion by the Department of the Environment/ Property ServicesAgency (DOE/PSA) of purpose-built accommodation in Cardiff between1980-82 and in Glasgow between 1982-84.3. Since July 1974 major reductions in the Ministry have been approved.These erode the practicability of the original proposals and have been accompanied by pressure on the defence budget and hardening staff attitudes.Indeed the threat of dispersal is greatly increasing our difficulties in gettingco-operation from the unions concerned in the essential rundown of poata andclosure of establishments necessary to meet our existing Public expenditure survey Committee targets,REDUCTIONS IN MOD HEADQUARTERS (HQ) NUMBERS4.        In addition to the Defence Review the MOD is now faced with public expenditure cuts and the implementation of its current Management Reviewof HQ functions.    Already in 1974 we had large elements of the Ministrydispersed (eg Bath and Harrogate) but the London HQ of the time was 19, 0001
uniformed and civilian personnel, and it was primarily to these staffs thatthe dispersal figures of 11, 000 were directed.    But the overall reduction inMOD HQ numbers by April 1984 is now planned to be around 20 per cent ofthe 1974 figures.    Moreover, the original baseline is being reduced stillfurther as some 2, 200 posts will be decentralised &quot; from the London area to existing MOD establishments in the provinces as a direct consequence ofvarious rationalisation plans designed to save staff and improve efficiency.We need these savings well before 1980 and in any event they would be nothinglike as large if the staff were to go to Cardiff or Glasgow.    The combined effect therefore of the 20 per cent reduction and the other decentralisationswill be to produce by 1984 an HQ baseline of some 13, 000 in the London area.BLOCKS OF WORK TO BE DISPERSED5.        The closer integration of policy and management of the three services to improve efficiency and economy was one of the main reasons for setting up the MOD in 1964.    The recent Management Review will continuethis process and offer the prospect of further savings in numbers.   Butdispersal runs directly counter to this policy.    It is extremely difficult to identify any blocks of work, particularly for Glasgow, which could bedispersed without serious loss of efficiency, and indeed without requiringsome additional staff at either end to offset the worst element ofinefficiency.    This is difficult to justify financially or to the Staff Side at atime when retrenchment is the key word in the MOD.6.        There are no longer any blocks of clerical factory work in Londonwhich could provide maximum job opportunities in the receiving locations.The MOD would be exporting people, not jobs.    This inevitably means theproblems and high costs of moving the homes of staff and families.   Theinclusion of Servicemen in the dispersal packages would cut back even further the locally recruited staff.    One potentially large and self-contained block ofwork, including job opportunities for local staff, was eliminated in January1976 when the Home Affairs Committee decided at that stage not to acceptthe proposed move of 1, 500 Quality Assurance staff to the Glasgow area,notably because of the high costs of reproviding capital facilities, but also because of the Committee&apos;s deep concern about the employment situation inthe London area and, in particular, in South East London.    This latterfactor has since been reflected in growing concern In Greater london council and South Eastern region circles because of the increasing drain on local job opportunities.7,        The problems at Cardiff are more the erosion of HQ numbers thanthe identification of potential areas of work.    The original target of 5,000 -effectively the total strength of the Procurement Executive HQ left inLondon - is now receding out of reach.    There are some 6, 000 MOD staff inBath, many of whom also are in the Procurement Executive, and Bath/Cardiff could be regarded as an integral unit for some purposes.2
STAFF SIDE ATTITUDES TO DISPERSAL3.        Initially, the MOD Staff Side &quot;reluctantly acquiesced&quot; in the decisionto disperse to Cardiff.    Their opposition to Cardiff is Increasing, but it Isnot total.    Glasgow is a different story as opposition has been total andunremitting throughout.    This is not so much because of the &quot;Gorbalaimage&quot; but because the Staff Side argue that it mpkes no sense on operationalor organisational grounds, that dispersal of MOD HQ work to Glasgow cannotbe reconciled with devolution; and that the expenditure cannot be justified inpresent circumstances.    The MOD Staff Side&apos;s attitude to dispersal hashardened considerably in line with the stand now being taken by the national staff Side.    The MOD Staff Side have now withdrawn their co-operation onthe dispersal exercise as a whole and the threat of dispersal is causing themto take a recalcitrant attitude on cuts, closures, redundancies, theManagement Review and reorganisation generally.    It is difficult to see how we could fill the large number of posts either at Glasgow or Cardiff not suitable for local recruitment, with appropriately qualified staff on avolunteer basis.    Any attempt at compulsion could jeopardise the functioning of the whole Ministry.COSTS OF DISPERSAL9.        Details of the estimated costs of MOD dispersal to DOE/PSA and thedefence budget aro given in the Annex.    These burdens on the defence budgetat a time of extreme financial stringency and in the light of existingpressures on the defence budget could put at risk operational capabilities.It is true that DOE/PSA is expecting in the longer term from 1983-84onwards to recoup the high initial capital costs of the building construction programme, but these running cost savings are very substantially offset byan increase in the MOD&apos;s running costs and in order to reap this realtivelymodest financial benefit PSA and MOD together will need in the critical yearsprior to 1983-84 to spend well over  100 million on construction costs, stafftransfers, travel, extra staff, married quarters and secure communications.10.       The estimates in the Annex have been reconciled with Civil service department (CSD) estimates for the dispersal programme as a whole, apartfrom a marginal divergence of up to  7 million in respect of transferallowances.    Both the Treasury and the CSD augur the figures shown as a sufficiently good indication for present purposes of the costs and benefitslikely to arise on the defence budget and the PSA programme in individualyears up to 1986-87.confidential
