PUBLIC EXPENDITURE SURVEY - 1978-79 AND AFTERMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryAt the end of our discussion on 26 October (CM(76)28th Conclusions, Minute 2),three items were left for further discussion:(i)   Savings to offset the increased expenditure on housing.(ii)   Selective assistance to industry.(iii)   Provision for additional bids by the Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food.The last of these was left over because of the absence of the Minister, and I have nothing to add to my recommendation in CP(76)91.   This paper concentrates on thetreatment of the other two items.Housing2.    The additional bids are set out in part 1 of Annex A.There is a total additional requirement of about sBB^^OO million in each year.      Cabinet accepted that this should be offset insome way.3.    As I indicated, it would in fact be feasible to offset those additional bidswholly within the housing programme.    The precise make up of the savings would boa matter for the Secretaries of State to consider, but an illustrative list ofthe components from which the savings in England could be made up is set out inpart 2 of Annex A.This subsumes the increase in council rents of 8op in April 197&amp;which was agreed on 26 October.   I have however suggested in Annex A that wo should announce our intention to secure si 80p increase in rents next April as well.This would increase the annual saving from 1978/79 onwards to  60 million*   andit would also provide  30 million in 1977/78 as a contribution to offsetting the excess in that year - a problem to which we will need to return separately.  Iventhese proposals involve a loss of rent income of  30 million in 1978/79, comparedwith that assumed in Cmnd. 6593*k.    As regards mortgage lending tho Secretary of State for the Environmentindicated that ho would bo prepared to make a reduction of  130 million in each
year, provided that the presentation of the public expenditure figures wasamended so as to seclude lending which is financed by loans from building societies.However, to exclude a particular type of local authority expenditure from the white paper figures because it was financed by borrowing from one source rather than another would be a major departure in presentation.   It could not be justified onthe grounds that lending by building societies to local authorities eased the financing of the public sector borrowing requirement, since the societies wouldbe likely to find the marginal extra funds by running down their holdings ofor local authoritygilt edged debt.   Nor could it be justified by analogy with the agreed change inthe treatment of capital expenditure by the nationalised industries:   that change will bring the presentation of our public expenditure figures more closely into line with normal international practice, whereas to exclude items of localauthority expenditure (which by normal international practice would be includedin &quot;general government&quot; expenditure)      would go in the other direction, andwould correspondingly risk being regarded as &quot;cooking the books&quot;.   We have just succeeded, with considerable effort, in securing the agreement of thetheExpenditure Committee tq/changes which we propose on the nationalised industries,nowbut it would be quite counter-productive/to come up with still further changesbefore the publication of the next White Paper.5.     I am therefore proposing that there should be a straightforward reductionof  150 million from the existing planned level of local authority mortgagelending.   The remainder of the savings could be obtained from the other itemsshown in Annex A.   The proposal    on    mew   housebuildingwould retain the same level of local   authority starts as is now providedfor 1977/78.   This is only 15$ less than the level assumed in the PESC report,and I do not think that it can reasonably be asserted that this will cause theprograms to collapse.   A reduction of  50 million on municipalisation would bring the expenditure in later years into fairly close correspondence with 1977/78.On improvement expenditure, I find it hard to believe that a programme of over IfOO million could not be pruned to the extent I am suggesting.6.    As regards housing in Wales, I have already indicated that I am willing toagree to an addition in 1978/79 and the later years of the  20 million whichthe Cabinet agreed to add to the base line in 1977/78*   But in my view anyremaining excess should then he offset by a package of savings of a similar kind to those shown in Annex A for England.
7.     The Cabinet also asked for an indication of other ways in which the excess could be offset.   Possible options for reductions inthe later years wereidentified in the PESC report.   Some of these relate to expenditure by localauthorities, and may ultimately be needed to keep their expenditure down to theCmnd. 6393 levels which we shall be maintaining as our aim in the next white paper.   If any further offsets are required we must therefore look mostly to possible options on central government expenditure in areas outside housing andand industry.   A list of these, drawn predominantly from the PESC report, is at annex C.Selective Assistance to Industry8.    The Secretary of State for Industry has submitted proposals to the ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy (El).   The main optionswere sot out in the report attached to my previous paper, but for conveniencethey are reproduced in Annex B.9.    The Secretary of State has proposed that we should approve the higher of thetwo alternative expenditure packages in Annex B (&quot;Case B&quot;), but with some furtherenhancement of the provision for the National Enterprise Board and the DevelopmentAgencies;   and that this should be offset mainly by abolition of regional employment premium in the development areas In a year&apos;s time.   He has alsoadumbrated two further possible sources of savings:   a review of the coverage ofthe assisted areas, and a reassessment of Post Office finances. On the first,the outcome can only be speculative at this stage.   The second I would not regardaa admissible under the new presentation of nationalised industries&apos; expenditure, andit would not help us in showing that we are keeping within the Cmnd. 6393 plans.The financing requirements of the nationalised industries are difficult to predict,and any savings fcreseen on a particular industry will need to bo held as a possibleoffset to demands arising from the other industries.   If these two further suggestedsavings are set aside, the net extra cost of the Secretary of State*s proposals is*57 million in 1977-78, and the following amounts in the later years -  million1978-791979-801980-817713015110. The Cabinet will need to consider these proposals in too light of therecommendations by El Committee.   The amount which wa can do at this stage
must however depend on the resources available, and it would be possible toconstruct, from the options identified by officials, a virtually self-balancingpackage, by limiting expenditure to the lower alternative package (&quot;Case A&quot;),and drawing rather more heavily on the other possible savings in Annex fi.   To theextent that Cabinet wish to concede any net increase, it would be necessary todraw on the options from other programmes in Annex C.Conclusions11.     Cabinet agreed on 2.6 October that the additional expenditure on housingmust be offset in some way.   It is similarly imperative to offset any net increase on assistance to industry.   The options in Annex C show that the problems involved in cutting other programmes will be no less severe than those involved inoffsetting within the housing and industry programmes.   I favour therefore the useof the savings options in Annex A for housing;   and limiting the industry package to&quot;Case A&quot;   and offsetting it fully by savings on REP.   If however, the Cabinetfeel that this solution should not be adopted in full, it is essential that thebalance of the savings required should be madeim from the list at Annex C.
