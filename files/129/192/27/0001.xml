CONFIDENTIALPUBLIC EXPENDITURE - 1978-79 AND LATER YEARSMemorandum by the Chief secretary at Cabinet on 4 November I was invited to arrange for Treasuryofficials to discuss possible savings in programmes other thanhousing with officials in the relevant spending departments.   I attach a paper which reports the outcome of those discussions.The offers made fall short of the sum which Cabinet had in mind,but the feasible savings which have been identified are more thanenough to cover it.2.     I recommend that the Cabinet should approve savings from amongthese items.   To the extent that such savings do not add up to thetotal sum needed to bridge the remaining gap, the balance will need to be found by further savings on housing.
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE - 1978-79 AND LATER YEARSNote by officials.     In their discussion on 4 November, the Cabinet agreed thatof the additional bids of about  4-50 million in each year for housing in England,  280 million could be found from within thehousing programme, leaving  170 million to be found from other programmes.   To facilitate further discussion, Treasury officials were asked to discuss possibilities bilaterally with officials inspending departments.2.     It was also agreed that similar treatment should be accorded to housing expenditure in Scotland and Wales.   This means that if their additional bids for housing subsidies are reduced throughincreases in rents and cuts in housing expenditure comparable tothose which produced the  280 million, a further  30 million remains to be absorbed or offset.   This raises to  200 million the figureof  170 million which was left to be found from programmes otherthan housing.(CP(76)96)3.     As the Chief Secretary&apos;s last memorandum/indicated, there are some limitations on the area from which the options for this purposecan be drawn.   The field of industrial assistance has been set asideto be considered in a separate review to be completed before theWhite Paper is published.   On local authority expenditure, theavailable options (both on current and capital) may ultimately be needed to attain the objective of keeping their expenditure withinthe Cmnd 6393 levels.   Civil Service staff costs have already beenconsidered by Cabinet, and the savings which were thought possiblehave already been scored.4.     The area for discussion on 11 November consists thereforeprimarily of central government options in fields other than those already mentioned above.   Officials have discussed the possibilities,without commitment, and the outcome of these discussions is reportedbelow.    (All figures at 1976 Survey prices.)-1-
DEFENCE5-     The Defence Budget has already been cut by several hundredmillion pounds since the Defence Review.   These savings have been achieved by a severe squeeze on support costs and deferment of equipment and works programmes.   MOD report that the cuts havedismayed our NATO Allies - in particular the Americans and Germans -who doubt our ability to absorb them without damage to our front 1W*contribution.6.     The Treasury consider it feasible, in the context of the presetexercise to prune the defence programme in 1978-79 and 1979-80 by upto  50 million consistently with existing defence policies and witbo^a major review.   The present provisional baseline figure for 1980-6&quot;1could be reduced by the same figure, although the final provision forthat year will have to be settled subsequently.7.     MOD believe that such cuts would disrupt the defence programme and undermine our credibility as an ally.   Moreover, the figures for1977-78 onwards assume a contribution of at least  50 million from the Germans towards the stationing costs of BAOR.   The effect ofthe cut indicated above would be more severe if, as the MOD considerlikely, it caused the Germans to refuse to negotiate a new stationingcosts arrangement, and if further cuts were then required to make good the loss of receipts.    (The Treasury believe that such cuts would follow from existing Ministerial decisions.)AID PROGRAMME8.     Substantial reductions in the aid programme are technicallyfeasible.   These could be either on the basis of cutting outuncommitted expenditure, which would give a cut in 1978-79 of 75 million, or by keeping the programme fiat at its 1977-78 level,giving a cut of  35 million.   For this programme there have been further bilateral discussions on this occasion, as this matter hasalready been identified as one for political decision.FOOD SUBSIDIES9-     The food subsidy provision of  84 million for 1978-79 and 56 million for later years is based on the assumption that all the-2-CONFIDENTIAL
subsidies other than milk will have been run down by the end of1977-78.   This sum is not allocated to particular products but isintended to provide a continuing basis for the payment of subsidiesgenerally.    In practice, it was expected that such a sum might beused:(i) for continuing a subsidy on milk in 1978-79 ( 84- million, whenrevalued to current prices, would probably finance a subsidy of1p a pint for about nine months);   and/or(ii) to enable us to take up any e.c. subsidies (the social beef schemeand butter are examples) that might be on offer at the time.10.   The nominal provision of  56 million for later years relatesonly to the second item.   On (i), a continued milk subsidy would be worth about 0.15% on the BPI.   On (ii) the only current e.c. subsidyscheme is for butter:   although it will continue to be available, weare unlikely to wish to take advantage of this particular scheme afternext autumn.   If, however, no provision were made for 1978-79, thenwithout calling on the contingency reserve we could not subsidisemilk or any other produce, or take up any e.c. scheme involving a UKcontribution (as did the beef and butter schemes).ROADS AND TRANSPORT (ENGLAND)11.   The Department of Transport are prepared to offer savings ontheir programme of  5 million in 1978-79 and  10 million in eachof the other two years.   If the traditional Scottish and Welshrelationship was maintained these figures would be increased by only 0.75 in 1978-79 and  1-5 million in the last two years for thosecountries.   But the Department of Transport point out that scottish and Welsh expenditures on motorways and trunk roads are about one-quarter of the total (ie much higher than the normal 85:10:5relationship)  and this could justify their bearing morethan the., normal share.    On the other hand,  this approach would involve a departure from the general treatment of scottish and Welsh programmes discussed in paragraph l6below.-3-
12.   The Department of Transport accept that, as a matter of feasi-bility, savings of up to  20 million in each of the three years couldbe obtained from their programme alone, but they do not offer to goas far as this.OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES (ENGLAND)15.   The Department of Environment take the view that the balance otsavings should be found from a broad range of expenditure programme8(other than housing) and that an appropriate contribution from them would be  10 million a year from capital expenditure of regionalwater authorities and  2-3 million a year from Office and GeneralAccommodation Services  (see paragraph 20 below).    In the view of theTreasury it would be possible to find savings of  20-30 million a 1**from regional water authorities without reducing the level of capitaexpenditure below that for 1977-78 following the July measures.    TheTreasury also consider that from capital expenditure on improvement &quot;fthe environment it should be possible to save  10 million a year (i*addition to the switch from capital to current expenditure recentlydiscussed in the Consultative Council on Local Government Finance)by some slowing down of work on sports centres and other recreational facilities.   A further  10 million a year might be saved by reducingthe increase in expenditure under the Community Land Scheme.EDUCATION AND LIBRARIES. SCIENCE AND ARTS (ENGLAND)14.   The Department of Education and Science are prepared to offer 25 million a year from 1978-79 onwards towards the requirement of 200 million.   This would be only part 0f their total savings in thethree years as they also have to .offset their own additional bids.Their total savings would then be as follows:  million1978-79   1979-80   1980-81School meal chargeSchool meal serviceUniversity furniture andequipment; and Science budgetBuilding programmes15	25	2512	12	1210	10	112	7	1239	5*	60
15.   If more were required from DES, it would be feasible to obtain a further  10 million a year from among the items listed above.SCOTLAND AND WALES16.   If reductions are agreed for England on any of the programmesmentioned in paragraphs 11 to 15 above, one way of securing the proportionate savings for Scotland and for Wales would be by using the customary ratio of 85 England:    10 Scotland:    5 Wales.   It wouldbe for the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales to decide whether the actual savings should be found from the same service as in England.HEALTH AND PERSONAL SOCIAL SERVICES (GB)17.   Department of Health and Social Security officials have made it clear in discussion that they were not authorised to offer savings on either the Social Security or Health and Personal Social Servicesprogrammes solely to offset additional expenditure on the housing programme.   The following therefore represent feasible savings whichhave been identified:-(a) A doubling of prescription charges (last increased in 1971*since when prices have doubled) from 20p to 40p would yield some 35 million (Great Britain) in each of the years in question.Exemptions (over 60% of prescriptions issued) would still cover the poor, elderly, children etc.(b) Failing such a saving equivalent reductions could be madeby further increases in dental charges (yielding, say  10 million a year) and reductions in capital and/or current expenditure onhospital and community health services.     This would in the viewof DHSS imply a small decline in the level of services.SOCIAL SECURITY18.   In Annex C of the Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum (CP(76)96) two possible measures were mentioned:--5-CONFIDENTIAL
(a) Withdrawing entitlement to flat-rate unemployment benefit for the first six days of any period of temporary suspension(saving  10 million a year and 500 staff).   It could be implemented by affirmative resolution and would prevent manipu-lation of short-term working in order to secure entitlement to benefit.(b) Withdrawing supplementary benefit from students in the longvacation (saving  10 million a year).   The saving allows for theextension of a hardship scheme already planned for the shortvacations.   Legislative provision would need to be added to theforthcoming Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.19.    In addition reductions in the planned net Exchequer cost of child Benefit of  20 million in 1977-78,  40 million in 1978-79 and 55 million in 1979-80 would be made if child tax allowances (CTAs)for non-resident children were phased out from April 1977 pari passuwith CTAs for children generally.OFFICE AND GENERAL ACCOMMODATION SERVICES20. A saving of  7 million a year would be feasible on civil servic* Ioffice and general accommodation services without any change in ldispersal policy.     This saving would, however, mean deferring reho^of regional offices or departments in the interests of efficiency o*improved working environment; some cutback on minor adaptations,furniture replacement and modernisation and office improvementschemes; and lower standards of maintenance. The view of the DePart**lof the Environment haa already been described in paragraph 13 above-SUMMARY21.   The attached table summarises the feasible savings on programme which have been the subject of bilateral discussions at official ^.In those cases where savings have been offered, the amount of the 0 &quot;has been shown as the lower end of a range.-6-
