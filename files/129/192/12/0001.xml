UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 8718 October 1976COPY NOClCABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT 1977-78 - DISCRIMINATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment*        At Cabinet on 3 August I was invited to prepare a paper on the scope for discrimination between local authorities in the distribution of rate support Grant (RSG).2,        Discrimination has been canvassed as a means of rectifying apossible unfairness in the distribution of grant in 1977-78.    The reduction ingrant will penalise all authorities pro rata to the grant they might otherwise have expected to receive.   Authorities who rely most on grant will be particularly affected.   There is therefore an argument for adjusting thedistribution of grant so that the effects of the grant reductions are felt onlyor at least more so by those authorities (whether rich or poor) whoseexpenditure growth in 1976-77 has brought about the grant reduction.   I havehad representations from authorities and Members of Parliament urgingsome protection for authorities who have followed the Government&apos;a guide-lines.3.        I had described possible means of discrimination through the RSGSystem to GEN 39.    I then said the Law Officers had to consider whether there was indeed scope for discrimination within the provisions of the 1974Local Government Act.    The Law Officers have now given their opinions.4.        The Attorney General considers there is no power in the Act fordiscrimination in the distribution at Main or Increase Order stages between individual authorities in relation to their expenditure performance.   he considers distribution can only be determined in relation to the needs and resources of individual authorities.    In any case in his view such anextension of present practice would open up a development of powers thatwould be difficult to define or limit in the future.1
5,        This opinion excludes any possibility of discriminating betweenauthorities in the RSG distribution In relation to the expenditure performance of individual authorities, though I am assured the Sections of the Act dealingwith the determination of total grant levels does allow expenditure trends andether financial and economic factors to be taken into account,6.        My own view has been against discrimination because of the seriouspractical and political difficulties involved.    It is difficult to conceive how wecould have operated a discriminatory system without being dragged Intodetermining the level of acceptable expenditure for each authority.   But Ihave accepted that because of the imperfections of the present system weshould continue searching for ways of improving it.7.        J will continue this search in the course of work on the development ofan improved grant system following the Layfield report.   An aim of thissystem might be to provide a more sensitive relation between the grantentitlement and needs of individual authorities.    This would enable me to influence the expenditure of individual authorities more effectively than we donow.   But this form of discrimination cannot be introduced overnight butznust form part of a coherent legislative package on local government finance*e a whole,PSDepartment of the Environment18 October 19762
