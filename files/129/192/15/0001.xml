UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 90 COPY NO   O 119 October 1976CABINETTHE RATE SUPPORT GRANT 1977-78Memorandum by the Central Policy Review staff. The papers by the Secretary of State for the Environment and theSecretary of State for Scotland (CP(76) 86 and CP(76) 89) assume that localauthorities1 current expenditure for 1977-78 will be about the same as theUkely outturn in 1976-77: ie no growth in real terms between the two years.To bring the rate of increase down to zero, after increases of 7 per cent ayear between 1971 and 1975, will have been a considerable achievement.2,        Unfortunately, the outturn in 1976-77 is likely to be some 300 million higher than the figures implied by the last Public expenditure white Paper (Cmnd 6393); so the aero-growth forecast implies anotheroverspend of  300 million next year.3.        The argument in CP(76) 86 and CP(76) 89 is that it is in practiceimpossible to force local authorities actually to reduce their expenditurenext year.   No growth is the best that one can hope for, and the 300 million overspend next year is therefore inevitable.4.        The Government have repeatedly stated their intention to keep to thepublic expenditure totals in the last White Paper.   Failure to do so would bebad for confidence, both at home and abroad, and will be extremelyembarrassing in discussions with bom the Expenditure Committee and theInternational Monetary Fund,5. H the Secretaries of State are right, and the  300 million overspendnext year is really inevitable, then Ministers will need:-a. To ffac a level of Rate Support Grant (RSG) consistent withaero growth,b. To find offsetting savings of  300 million from other programmes in order to keep the public expenditure totals within theCmnd 6393 limits.confidential
6.        A decision on 5a. may not be too difficult.    5b. will be verydifficult indeed.7,        In these circumstances. Ministers may wish to ask whether aerogrowth, with the built-in overspend of  300 million, really is inevitable.    Ifthe RSG settlement were tougher, would it really have no net effect on current expenditure at all?   Would the authorities be prepared to financetheir present levels of expenditure simply by putting up the rates to the levelrequired, irrespective of the size of the rate increase?   Is there not somescope for reductions both in services and in manning levels ?   If there is,should not the RSG settlement be tougher, so as to try to reduce the 300 million overspend, and so leave less to be found by offsetting savings from other programmes?8.        Ministers are faced with three very unpalatable choices:-a. To risk antagonising local authorities and provokingpolitically unacceptable rate increases.b. Finding offsetting savings of  300 million from other programmes,c. Some compromise between a. and b, above.Cabinet Office19 October 19762
