UMENT ]S THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 88COPY NO       J18 October 1976CABINETDIRECT ELECTIONS:INTRODUCTION OF legislation memorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome DepartmentINTRODUCTION1*        We last discussed direct elections to the European Assembly on29 July (CM(76) 21st Conclusions, Minute 6).    Since then, on 20 September,the Community Instrument haB been finalised and signed by all member states.    The instrument contains no commitment to a specific date for thefirst direct elections but Includes a &quot;best endeavours11 clause in relation toMay/June 1978.    The clause and its Implications are set out in Annex A.Meanwhile, the Select Committee on Direct Elections have published their second Report on 19 August in which they conclude that:-&quot;... if this country is to continue to Beek to hold direct elections in May or June 1978, the House should be invited to take decisionsat an early date on the allocation of seats between the component parts of the United Kingdom, the electoral system and the terms ofreference and procedures to be given to the Boundary Commissions.They therefore urge that the Government should find time for a debate in the House on these issues In the autumn at the earliestpossible moment.    In any event a short Bill should be introduced at the outset of the new Session, &quot;At the recent Labour Party Conference there was a clear (but not two-tWxda)majority against the principle of direct elections, and serious misgivingsabout their likely outcome for the Labour Party;   but we have a firm inter-^Uonal commitment to hold them.2.       Against tills background we must consider now what action is to betaken in regard to legislation on direct elections and what should be said on*** subject in The Queen&apos;s Speech.1
TIMING OF legislation.        The Select Committee have put a case for early legislation.    If we wish to be ready for direct elections in May 1978 and if we wish to use the type of Boundary Commission procedure proposed by the Select Committee,we would need to introduce a Bill very early next Session.    While we havemade it plain to our European colleagues that we can give no guarantee ofbeing able to meet the date suggested of May/June 1978, we have equallymade it clear - as the Cabinet agreed on 8 July - that we would use our&quot;best endeavours&quot; to meet this date.    The Select Committee1 s consideredview is that we can only meet this date on the basis they have proposed Ifwe introduce an early Bill.    If it becomes apparent that we are not introducingan early Bill, questions will be bound to be asked and out good faith may be challenged in Brussels.    This could have repercussions on the attitudes ofother Member Slates to the more important objectives we shall be wantingto pursue in the Community.4.        On the other hand, we have to recognise that legislation on directelections will be controversial since it will raise the questions of the way inwhich our 81 seats are to be allocated between England, Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland, and the electoral system to be used.    The Lord Presidenthas drawn attention to the difficulties which would be involved for ourlegislative timetable as a result of the heavy burden of devolution legislationnext Session.    There is a connection here of substance as well as timetable:a Bill on direct elections to the European Assembly would, like the devolutionBill, raise the difficult problem of the representation of the component partsof the United Kingdom.5.       At this stage the only essential stop that need be taken, in order to demonstrate our intention to prepare for direct elections, is to include in the queen&apos;s Speech a statement that legislation will be introduced, but withoutany commitment about the timing of its introduction.   With such a statementof intention it should hardly be necessary to have an early debate on theSelect Committee^ Second Report.   The drafting of a Bill should now, if my colleagues agree, be put in hand; but a decision on the timing of its introduction could be deferred until the devolution legislation has madeprogress.   The position might then be reviewed in the light of the steps taken by our Community partners.    If it then appeared that any of them would find it difficult to be ready by May/June 1978 there would be a case for seeking to defer the elections until the autumn of 1978.    If, on the other hand, it became essential for us to try to meet the May/June 1978 timetable,consideration could be given to providing for a truncated boundary commission procedure, although Parliament might well be reluctant toaccept this.2
CONTENT OF LEGISLATIONElectoral System6.        I recommend that we should accept the Select Committee^recommendation that the &quot;first past the post&quot; system should be used for thefirst round of elections.Allocation of Seats7.        The Select Committee recommended that of the 81 seats allocated tothe United Kingdom by the decision of the European Community 66 should be assigned to England, eight to Scotland, four to Wales and three to NorthernIreland.    Possible distributions are set out in Annex B,   I understand thatthe Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is considering the political implications of this for Ulster, which obviously need very carefulconsideration.    My colleagues may wish to give further consideration to thismatter at a later stage.Boundaries of Constituencies8.        The timing problems referred to in paragraphs 3-5 above arise mostacutely in regard to the arrangements for determining the constituency boundaries.    The Select Committee reached the conclusion mat if the boundary Commissions were to have time to do their work properly the Billshould complete its passage through both Houses by the end of February 1977.This would allow time for the Boundary Commissions to make and publishprovisional recommendations, invite representations and, where necessary,hold local inquiries before presenting their final proposals, whioh would need to be approved by Parliament not later than January 1978, to allow thenecessary preparations for the elections to be made, eg selection of candidates.   Even this procedure would be a shortened version of that usedfor Westminster constituenciee, and, as I have suggested in paragraph 5above, we may have to consider shortening it still further.    I proposetherefore to put a further paper to my colleagues in due course, setting outpossible abbreviated procedures for determining the constituency boundaries,and the timing of the various stages, so that a decision can be taken on thispoint before a Bill is introduced,Other Matters9.       The Select Committee intend to produce a further report (whichshould be available before Christmas) on candidature, the franchise, postalvoting, expenses and other matters.   We can await the Committee&apos;s reporth*fore reaching final decisions on these points.   Subject to that, I am inclined to think that the Bill as introduced should provide for our normalelection practice to be followed for the first round of direct elections, apartfrom the inclusion of peers in the franchise (as for local government elections).3
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS10,        On the basis of coats at the European Economic Communityreferendum, direct elections will cost at least  10 million.    The actual costmay be higher than this as a result of increases in postal charges and feesto returning officers and their Btaffs,    Any extensions to absent votingarrangements would also add to the costs.    It seems unlikely that thesecosts would be met from Community funds.CONCLUSION11.       I invite my colleagues to agree that:i. The Queen&apos;s Speech should contain a commitment to legisla-tion in the next Session (which of course would not commit ue as towhen a Bill would be introduced).ii. Authority should be given for the drafting of legislation(including alternative Boundary Commission procedures) to begin,iii. Further consideration should be given to a. the allocation of seats between the constituent parts of the United Kingdom; b. theprocedure for determining the constituency boundaries (including thepossibility of a truncated Boundary Commission procedure); and c.the timing of the Bill, in the light of progress with the devolutionlegislation and the preparations made by our Community partners.M RHome Office*8 October 1976
Annex ADIHECT ELECTIONS TO THE EUROPEAN ASSEMBLYOF FIRST ELECTIONSne preamble to the deacision on direct elections signed on 20 September 1976contains a &quot;best endeavours&quot; clause as follows -&quot;intending to give effect to the conclusion of the European Councilin Rone on 1 and 2 December 1975* that the election of the Assembly-should be held on a sigle date within the period May/June 1978&quot;.^tlcle 9 of the Act provides that &quot;elections to the Assembly shall be held on^ date fixed by each Member State; for all Member States this date shall fall^thin the same- period starting on a Thursday morning and ending on the followingSunday&quot;.   Article 10 of the Act provides that &quot;The Council, acting unanimously^ter consulting the-Assembly, shall determine the period referred to in^&quot;ticle 9(1) for the first elections.   Subsequent elections shall take place*n the corresponding period in the last year of the 5-year period referred toin Article 3&quot;.^*    The effect of these provisions is that each Member State can decide its0VQ        for elections within a Thursday to Sunday period determined by the0Un.cil.   The Council must be unanimous in agreeing to the period for the first-Actions.^*    The logic of the instrument that has been agreed is that direct electionsftot take place in any Member State until all Member States are ready to**** them.NOTE-^ Coaeidering the possibility of holding elections to the European Assemblyne same date as other elections it is necessary to bear in mind that -ta)   Some local elections in England, Scotland and Wales are due to beheld in May 1978.(b)   It is provisionally proposed that the first elections to theScottish and Welsh Assemblies should be held in the &quot;Spring&quot; of 1978.
The Select Cor.inittec reconverted that Euro-peer. Assemblyconstituencies should be formed by grouping existing Parliamentaryconstituencies, the boundaries of which ere different from those used for local government elections.Article 9(2) of the Decisions of the European Communities providesthat the counting of votes nay not begin until after the last KenberState has finished voting.
