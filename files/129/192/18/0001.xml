TACTICAL PLAtf FOR THE RUN UP (OCTOBER-DECEMBER 1976)TO THE BRITISH PRESIDENCY (JANUARY-JUNE 1977)Memorandum by the Secretaries1.     In accordance with normal practice a paper would now be circulated on ourtactioal objectives in the European Community over the next three months (of theUnited Kingdom Tactical Plan May-July 1976 circulated to the European Unit asEUT(76) 9 of 5 May).     But the paper which is being separately circulated on ourhandling of the British Presidency sets out in some detail our objectives overthe whole range of Community activities of any substantial importance to theUnited Kingdom.     And any Beparate detailed description for the interveningthree months would simply duplicate most of this material.     So this paper,which should be reed in conjunction with the separate paper on the EritishPresidency concentrates in summary form on the main issues likely to becurrent over the next three months and in particular on any differences in handling between this period and our Presidency.2.     The dominant issue now, and throughout our Presidency, is our need tosecure changes in the Common Jlsheries Policy and to secure adequate results inthe Community^ negotiations with third countries including continuedfishing off Iceland from 1 November.     Our main immediate priority this autumn.is to work for a decision at the Council on 10 October that MemberStateB will extend their limits.     If some other Member States will not beready by 1 January to extend their limits, we may need to accept thatthere will be a series of national extensions with 1 January 1977 as an agreed Community target date, others following as soon as they are ready.     Wemust also examine the implications of a unilateral British extension in theevent that there is no agreed Community date.     We will need to take afinal decision on all this before 10 October;   in the meantime enablingdomestic legislation is in an advanced Btate of preparation.     Our othermain priority is to decide our line on the Commission proposals communicated toCOREPER on 23 September.     Papers will separately bo coming forward to ministers on these issues.
3-     in relation to the cap the submissiea of tho coralmxon&apos;a proposals foragricultural prioos for 1977 is likely to ho hold over until tho now year.but wo are under considerable pressure - given the reoont decline in thosterling parity - to agree to changes in tho green pound.   there will becouncil discussions throughout tho autuan of a number of other mattersparticularly the proposals already submitted for improving the milk sector andprobably also of support measures for beef.   and ministers will be consideringtheir approach to tho next price fixing.it.     ministers will bo considering further in the light of the meeting oftho council of ministers (research) in luxembourg on 21 october and a furtherassessment of tho scientific and financial implications our bid to secure the location of tho jit project in tho united kingdom (at culham near oxford).elsewhere in tho energy field progress on a eommom energy policy is hold up at the moment by trench reluctance to give effect to the concept of a minimum safe-guard price.   we pressed thorn hard at the 19 october council and will continueto do so both in bilateral and in community discussions until tho end of theyear.   tho trench position will largely determine tho pace at which progress can bo made.3.     on enlargement substantive negotiations en greek accession will begin in theautumn with a formal mooting at ministerial level on tho occasion of the meetingof the council (foreign affairs) in luxembourg on 18-19 october.   it is not yet known whom the portuguese will submit their application for full membership (orwhether this application will mention tho possibility of a pro-accession period).in either ease tho application will involve inviting tho commission to prepare an opinion.6.     in tho trade field ministers will be considering shortly a memorandum by the secretary of state for trade on how the prime minister might best raise at theeuropean council on 29-30 revember the question of a more balanced development oftrade with japan.   there will be some discussion in the autumn of the now draftmandate for trade negotiations with spain whore we want to resist any attempts to force us to align to tho old 1970 agreement (which would mean increasing foodtariffs ea our part) while trying to secure the same preferential access to the valuable spanish market as enjoyed by the original six.   discussion will also takeplace about tho commission^ proposals for a now agreement with iran  where we willmood to maintain our general support for the commissions non-preferentialproposals.   discussions will eontisuo on tho form and modalities of tho e.c. replyto tho cm1a draft agreement - whore we want to got community agreement to a2
25 October 19765counter draft preferably In the fora of a mixed agreement between the community and ita Kaabor States on the one band and the CMEA and its Member States on theother which would make provision for subsequent bilateral agreements betweenthe Community and the individual CMEA Member States.   In so far as Multilateralnegotiations are concerned it is not likely that auch will bo happening on the multilateral trade negotiation front until next year, but the formulation of aCoaamaity Mandate for the renegotiation of the GATT Multi-Fibre Arrangenent willstart in October and will have to be completed and endorsed by the Council ofMinisters by the beginning of December when the formal review of the KFA beginsin the OATT.7.     In the North/South dialogue increasingly difficult negotiations will takeplace in the CISC formally duo to bo wound up at a Ministerial conference inDecember this year.   Seme concessions by the industrialised countries in thefield of debt relief appear to bo required if the CISC is to end in a reasonablyfriendly atmosphere.   Simultaneously the Community needs to co-ordinate itaposition for the UNCTAD &quot;preparatory meeting&quot; on the Common Fund in November toprepare for a Co-unity position for the meetings planned for individual products -particularly copper.   An unresolved question concerns the basis on which the cm-unity will participate in these discussions;   our lino on how the community is represented will depend largely on the extent to which agreement is reached on the substance of Community positions.8.    On institutional matters Ministers will be discussing in October whether to introduce an early Bill to provide for direct elections as recommended by theSelect Co-ittee report on 19 August.   It is to bo hoped that discussion of theTindemans Boport can be concluded at the European Council at its meeting on29-30 NovMberjtidft/conaider the proposals which the Prise Minister will make for the terms of reference of a review of the Commission.   And wo are likely tocome under pressure in the Council to state our position on the Commissionsproposals for the hamoniaatien of su-or time periods - and Ministers may thereforeneed to consider soon the need for wider consultation and a Parliamentary debateas a preliminary to taking up a position on the proposed dates which are supportedby the majority in the Community in tho interests of simplifying transporttimetables.
