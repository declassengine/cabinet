DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 10816 November 1976REFORM OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACTSNota by the Prime Minister1. The Ministerial Group on Official Information, first under sir Harold Wilson&apos;s chairmanship and then under mine, have been considering fo:.. nome time how best to give effect to the Government1 s under-taking, in The Quee;c*s Spa-icb on the Opening of Parliament in november last year, that proposals would be prepared &quot;to amend the Official secrets acts and to liberalise the practice relating to official information&quot;.    In my statement on the Child Benefit leak on 1 July I said that the governmenth oped to bring forward their proposals as soon as possible for reformingthe Official Secrets Acts in a way which would make its coverage both more limited and more effective.2.        The Ministerial Group have now reached conclusions on the major issues, and these conclusions are set out in the draft of a parliamentary statement at Annex A.3.        The broad effect of the conclusions is to follow the recommendationsof the Franks Committee in narrowing the protection of criminal sanctionsto specific categories of official information but to modify those categoriesso as to make the package more liberal in respect of information broadlydealing with home and economic policy, which includes the bulk of cabinet documents; and somewhat more restrictive in reBpect of information in the fields of intelligence and security, defence and international relations.4.        I believe that these modifications result in a package significantlymore liberal than that proposed by Franks.    In particular, the rejection of the Franks recommendation that Cabinet and Cabinet Committeedocuments should be protected as a class,  (respective of content and security classification, should have a considerable appeal to liberal opinion.It is consistent with, and can be defended on the basis of, the general principle, which commended itself to the Ministerial Group, that criminal sanctions should not be deployed to protect information whose unauthorised disclosure, wrong though it is, results in mere political embarrassment.It seems likely, however, to be attacked by the Opposition and it may berepresented as a reversal of the Governments stance on the Child Benefitleak.copy NO     gjjCABINETconfidential
5.        Against this, the Ministerial Group judged that some extensions ofthe Franks categories in the fields of intelligence and security, defence and international relations would be necessary and unlikely to provoke serious criticism.    The effects of these extensions are that intelligence and securitywould form a separate category irrespective of security classification(whereas Franks had included them under the heading of defence and internal security) and that the category of DEFENCE - CONFIDENTIAL (limited byFranks to information about weapons and equipment) would be widened toinclude defence policy and strategy and information in the field of international relations whose unauthorised disclosure would be prejudicial to Britishinterests, to relations with foreign Governments or to the safety of Britishcitizens; it would include appropriate information received in confidencefrom other Governments or inter-governmental organisations.MORE EXTENSIVE PUBLICATION OF OFFICIAL INFORMATION6.        The Miristerial Group have also considered at length the separatequestion of devising a more systematic policy for making official information available to the public.    The Government have a good record, better than weare generally given credit for, of publishing official information in the formof Green Papers, discussion documents and the like.    The Group&apos;conclusion was that this policy should be further developed and that thereshould be a greater readiness to publish the factual and analytical materialassociated with major studies, such as policy appraisal reviews (PARs),but that any system involving automatic publication or a public right of accesswould be unworkable or too costly to administer.    This is consistent with theCabinet*s conclusion, at their meeting on 14 October, that while the factualmaterial in PARs could normally be published, it would be desirable to retainflexibility over the question of publishing the remainder of the material, and each case would need to be judged on its merits.7.        I propose therefore to make a statement of the Government&apos;8 intentionto publish as much as possible of the factual and analytical materialassociated with major studies and so substantially to increase the amount ofthis sort of material which Is made available.    This might be on the linesof the draft at Annex B.conclusion.        I invite the Cabinet to endorse the conclusions of the ministerial group on both the reform of the Official Secrets Acts and more extensivepublication of official information, and to agree that a suitable opportunity should be taken to announce them in Parliament on the lines of the draftstatements attached.L J C10 Downing Street16 November 1976 .
ANNEX a section 2 OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 19111.        I will with permission make a statement on the Government&apos;s intentionson the reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911.    This Section,which makes it a criminal offence to disclose official information withoutauthority, has for some time been regarded as too broad in its scope - ithas been described as a &quot;catch all&quot; - and there has been uncertainty about its interpretation and enforcement.    The Government have concluded thatthis Section should be replaced by an Official Information Act on the broadlines recommended by the Franks Committee.    The Committee, whosemembership included representatives of Parliament and the media, and whopresented a unanimous report, recommended that the sanctions of the criminal law should be strictly limited in their application.    It is of coursewith the criminal law that we are here concerned, and not the practices andrules about disclosure of information in the public service.2.        The Franks Committee recommended that the criminal law should apply to disclosure of information relating to foreign affairs, defence and internal security, and currency and the reserves when that information is classified SECRET or above or in the case of certain defence informationclassified as DEFENCE - CONFIDENTIAL: and also to the disclosure ofCabinet documents, confidences of the citizen and certain information inthe field of law and order, such as information that would facilitate crime.Information in these three last categories was to be protected regardless ofany security classification.3,        The Government accept the Committee&apos;s general approach to theproblem, but in considering the categories of information that ought to be protected by the criminal law we think it right to draw a clearer distinctionbetween home and economic policy on the one hand and security and intelligence, defence and international relations on the other.    Theunauthorised disclosure of any official information is wrong because it isunauthorised.    But in the domestic field it will generally result in embarrass -ment to the Government of the day and not in serious damage to the national interest.    In the fields of security and intelligence, defence and international relations on the other hand such damage may well result.4.        In the economic field the Government have reached the conclusion thata criminal sanction is not justified.    It is relevant mat the Franks report was prepared at a time of fixed exchange rates.   In any case it would not in theGovernments view be appropriate to distinguish between currency and the reserves and, for example, domestic interest rates and monetary and fiscalpolicies.   Faced with a realistic choice between applying criminal sanctionsto a wider economic category and the exclusion of economic information from their ambit, it seems right to us that the criminal offence should not extend to economic information.3
5. The Government also propose to depart from the Franksrecommendation that there should be a criminal sanction for the disclosure of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents, irrespective of their content and security classification.    The Committee rested the case for inclusionof this category on the need to safeguard the collective responsibility ofthe Cabinet.  The doctrine of collective responsibility is fundamental to our system of government and the Government totally accept that the documents of the Cabinet and its Committees deserve special protection.    They do not,however, consider that that protection should consist of applying criminal sanctions to the disclosure of documents irrespective of their content andclassification.    The bulk of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents dealwith domestic affairs.    The protection of these documents is a matterbasically of trust and good cense among colleagues.    It is also a matter of ensuring that the principleb and special procedures for distributing andhandling Cabinet documents are properly observed and improved where necessary; and in that connection the Governments conclusions on the reportof Lord Houghton&apos;8 Committee on Cabinet document security will be made known shortly.6.        The Government have therefore concluded that Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents should be protected by criminal sanctions only whenby their content and security classification they fall into one of the other categories so protected.?. The Government accept the need to protect by criminal sanctions the franks Committees proposed categories of confidence of the ciUsen andcertain law and order information, as well as that of disclosure for gain (towhich the report of the Royal Commission on Standards of Conduct in public life is relevant).    These depend upon special considerations for which webelieve that the Committee has made a case.8.        In the fields of security and intelligence, defence and international relations, the Government have concluded that some rearrangement and extension of the Franks categories is required.   Information relating to security and intelligence matters is deserving of the highest protectionwhether or not it is classified.    The Government propose therefore thatthis should form a separate category.   In the defence field the franks committee recommended that confidential Information relating to militaryweapons and equipment should be given the special marking of DEFENCE -CONFIDENTIAL and be -protected by RTiminal sanctions.  The Government have concluded that confidential information of a sensitive and potentially damagingkind goes rather wider than this in both the defence and international fields.It extends to certain areas of defence policy and strategy and of international relations where unauthorised disclosure would be prejudicial to Britishinterests, to relations with a foreign government or to the safety of Britishcitizens.    The Government therefore propose to extend this Franks conceptto become DEFENCE AND INTERNATIONAL - CONFIDENTIAL and to define it somewhat more widely than Franks,4
9.        Legislation on this basis will be introduced as soon as is practicable,but it cannot be during the current Session.    Although much detail remains to be worked out, I thought it right to inform the House of the Government&apos;sbroad intentions.    The Government believe that their conclusion represents a system more liberal man that proposed by the Franks Committee, but one which secures the highest degree of protection for information whosedisclosure may cause serious harm to the interests of the cation.5
ANNEXBOPENNESSDraft Statement by the Prime minister the Government believes that the quality of policy decisions isimproved if factual and analytical material about the nature of the problems and their possible solution is made available aB a basis for well-informedpublic debate.There is already an established practice whereby, when publicdebate is sought in a particular policy area, the Government can issue aGreen Paper as a basis for discussion before decisions are reached.Other  kinds of informative document are also issued from time to time.The Government wholeheartedly supports such techniques, and intends inthe future to seek to use them whenever appropriate.The Government also intends in future to seek opportunities to publishas much as possible of the factual and analytical material associated withmajor policy studies.    This will include such material in programme analysis Reviews.    There may be circumstances in which publication ofPAR material, as a whole or in part, cannot be authorised, for example ifthe documents concerned were produced for a previous Administration, but thegeneral aim will be to increase substantially the amount of this sort ofinformation available to the public.    When policy reviews are being under-taken in future it will, therefore, be a working assumption that the supportingfactual material will be made public in due course unless there are good reasons to the contrary in that particular area.I should however stress that the cost to public funds of making more information available in this way must be kept to a minimum.    Thepublication of any policy conclusions of such reviews will continue, as atpresent, to be a matter for Ministerial announcement.
