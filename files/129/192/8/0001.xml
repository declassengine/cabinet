DoCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 83U October 1976CABINETUSE OF THE MEDICINES ACT TO CONTROL SMOKINGMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services,the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of Statefor wales. We seek our colleagues&apos; views aB to the way in which the Governmentshould carry forward their policy on the control of smoking, as announced in the House of Commons last January.2.        In 1962 a report from the Royal College of Physicians presentedincontrovertible evidence that the effects of smoking, of cigarettesespecially, were malign.   Successive Governments since then have felt obliged to seek to curtail the freedom of tobacco manufacturers andImporters to decide what they should sell and how they should promote It.The statutory powers available for this purpose have however been limitedto some totally inadequate fiscal legislation; and this has hampered the ability of Government to obtain concessions from the tobacco companies.So too has the fact that the smoking habit gives employment to many, andalso provides substantial benefits to the Exchequer, the Press, and, as aresult of the growth of sponsorship, to sport and the arts.   As a result,the achievements of 14 years of Government intervention are disappointing *there has been a reduction in the average amount of tobacco in a cigaretteand of the tar it yields, but an increase of nearly 25 per cent in the numberof cigarettes sold; and there has been only a small fall in the total numberof smokers, which has occurred mainly amongst the better off,3.        The Social Services Committee concluded in 1975 that to achieve the considerable further progress needed the Government had to be able tonegotiate with the industry from the strength accorded by statutory powers.It also decided that consultations should begin with the industry and theother interests concerned on the general lines, but without specificcommitment, that the Medicines Act, 1968, with or without amending legislation, would be the vehiae for exercising statutory controls over^e promotion and sale of tobacco.COPY NO1
4.        The consultations indicated that, whilst all the tobacco companies would tight the widespread use of the Medicines Act to control tobacco, someof them might accept a compromise providing for the limited use of powers under the Medicines Act 1968 to license tobacco products containingsubstitutes and additives, and for negotiations on voluntary arrangementsinvolving reduction of noxious yields in smoking products, improved healthwarnings etc.    This compromise was endorsed by the Social services committee and was subsequently accepted by the main United Kingdom basedfirm - Imperial Tobacco - and by Carreras-Rothman, which between themsupply over 70 per cent of cigarettes sold In the United Kingdom; and on16 January last the Minister of State, Department of Health and social security, announced the Government&apos;a policy in the House of Commons.5.        Between January and June there were the following developments -a. The consultation required under the Medicines Act beforethe necessary draft Order on substitutes and additives could besubmitted to Parliament for the Affirmative Resolution showed thatthe proposal was acceptable to all the United Kingdom tobaccomanufacturers and importers save one,    Tbe latter - BritishAmerican Tobacco (BAT) - which had only recently started testmarketing prior to entering the home market - indicated privatelythat they would challenge the validity of the Order,b. The Budget speech announced the arrangements for harmonisingour tobacco duty to comply with the European Economic Community(e.c.) Directive; this means that from 1 January 1978 the existingfiscal legislation will cease to be available to control substitutesand additives.    Many manufacturers and importers have made cleartheir intention to use substitutes and additives widely,6*        The Law Officers have always advised that there would be a risk ofchallenge to the Order both by the Joint Committee on Statutory instruments and in the Courts; mat the prospects of a challenge in the Courts beingSuccessful were evenly balanced; but that any proceedings would almost certainly be prolonged.    The view of the Social Services Committee at itsmeetings last year and in January was that, despite these risks it would on balance be right to go ahead with the draft Order.   A similar conclusion was reached at a meeting chaired by the Lord President in June when it wasagreed that the right course was on balance for the Government to proceedquickly with the package of voluntary and statutory controls over tobaccoand tobacco substitutes and additives, bearing in mind that the only alternative course - early primary legislation - seemed impracticable innext Session of Parliament.7*        The Secretary of State for Scotland, however, argues that it wouldbe wrong in. principle for the Government to proceed with an Order which isknown to be legally shaky, and that it is not worth incurring the resultantQdium for the sake of a power which does not bite on tobacco as such, but2
only on substitutes and additives.    The alternative which would achieve the objectives we all support would be to put the validity of such an Orderbeyond doubt by a short Government Bill (which might amount to two clausesand a schedule).    The legislation could be drafted either to take powers tocontrol tobacco itself, as well as substitutes and additives, or be limited tosubstitutes and additives.    The latter course would still be within the spiritof the compromise reached with Imperials and Carreras-Rothman, and ifthe former course were followed we should have to emphasise tliat the wider powers over tobacco could not be used without a separate Order which wouldbe subject to approval by Parliament.8.        In view of the very great pressure of the Parliamentary timetableit is worth considering adding this legislation to the Bill which has to beIntroduced to recoup the National Health Service for the cost of roadaccidents.    The alternative is to offer the Bill to a Private Member butthat leaves some degree of uncertainty which would be damaging to our relationship with the industry.9.        We are agreed that the greatest evil would be to fail to carryforward, without further delay, the Governmenfs clear commitment tobring tobacco substitutes and additives, at least, within the scope of theMedicines Act.    For us to remain inactive would result in the completeloss of our credibility - all the more so because of the earlier failure to implement the announcement made by the Minister of Health in 1967 thatthere would be Government legislation on smoking.    We should be givingway to the obstinacy and commercial interests of one company; we shouldhave to face protests from other companies, many of whom are heavilycommitted to work on substitutes and additives; and our whole policy onsmoking would be disastrously weakened.CONCLUSION10.       We accordingly ask our colleagues to agree that tiie Governmentsannounced policy on smoking, an essential element in which is to bringtobacco substitutes and additives indisputably within the scope of theMedicines Act, should be endorsed and carried forward in the next Session,Our preferred course would be for early legislation, which would be announced in The Queen&apos;b Speech, to amend Section 105 of the Medicines Actto bring tobacco substitutes and additives indisputably within the Act.D EB MJ MDepartment of Health and Social SecurityU October 19763
