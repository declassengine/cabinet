DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYlS government cp(76) 101 COPY NO      818 November 1976CABINETTHE QUEEWS SPEECH ON THE OPENING OF THE NEW session memorandum by the Lord President of the council. On 28 October the Cabinet agreed a number of amendments to thedraft Opening Speech attached to CP(76) 95, identified several points whereamendments should be considered and Invited responsible Ministers to make suggestions for Improving the drafting.    The Cabinet also invited the queen&apos;a Speeches and Future Legislation (QF) Committee to consider, inthe light of the decision to defer the start of the new Session, which bills should be mentioned in the draft Speech and the priorities among the bills in the provisional legislative programme (CM(76) 29th Conclusions,Minute 4).    On 26 October the Cabinet noted that consideration needed to begiven to the possibility of Increasing the time available next Session, forexample by reducing short Recesses or time for general debates(CM(76) 28th Conclusions, Minute 1).    This paper reports the conclusions reached by the QF Committee after hearing the views of ministers responsible for the Bills in question,2a        I attach:At Annex 1. a revised version of the Opening Speech, whichincorporates all the amendments decided by the Cabinet on28 October,    The Speech also includes amendments to meet theother points identified in the Cabinet discussion, .and other amendments suggested by responsible Ministers, which are side-lined In the text.At Annex 2, a note on how much Parliamentary time can be madeavailable next Session for Government Bills,At Annex 3, a list of Bills, which reflects the conclusions reached bythe QF Committee on priorities.    In general, the committee consider that the priorities previously established by the cabinet should stand.    They thcught, however 0 that special considerationsapplied to two second priority 3ills which are mentioned In theattached draft of the Speech (those on Welsh Water Charges and1
Patents; the latter is included subject to the agreement of theOpposition, who are being consulted, to the Second reading committee procedure in the House of Commons),    The Committeealso considered that the Bill on industrial democracy in the PostOffice no longer warranted first priority.    They regretfullyconcluded that there would not be room to mention the HomelessnessBill (a first priority Bill) or any other second priority Bill.At Annex 4, for the information of colleagues, a note of the amendments to the draft of the Prorogation Speech circulated withCP(76) 95.3. The situation can be summarised thus.    After two exceedinglyheavy Sessions, we now face a third which may be even worse.   We cannotbe certain how much time will be needed for the Scotland and Wales Bill,but it might be as much as 30 days on the Floor of the Commons and wecannot risk allowing less.    The other Bills which are unavoidable next session, or likely to become so, will take up virtually all the rest of theavailable time.    By dint of cutting short Recesses to the bone (the shortestChristmas Recess on record and one week each at Whiteun and Easter) andwith a two-week spillover, we can just accommodate the three other Billsmentioned in the draft Speech, with no margin to spare.    To include evenone more Bill would condemn us to the certainty of a three-week spillovernext autumn.    Indeed, given a strong probability that (as happened last session and this) unexpected requirements for urgent legislation will arise,and given the enhanced capacity for delaying Government business - both onthe Floor and in Standing Committee - now possessed by the Opposition, itis already likely that we shall have to sit into August once more, or have aspillover of more than two weeks, or both,4,        Against this background the QF Committee concluded that the numberof Bills promised in the attached draft Speech was an absolute maximum.    if anything, the draft already promises more Bills, and the envisaged cuts inthe Recesses are already more severe, than is prudent.    I well understand the views of colleagues who wish the Speech to promise more Bills which arepolitically attractive and involve no public expenditure.    I wish we could doso.    But we have to consider whether this is the right time in the life of theGovernment to commit ourselves to a programme which would be even morepunishing than is already inevitable and which we might well be unable tocomplete,M FPrivy Council Office8 November 19762

(confidential)     -1976-77 SESSION:   TIME AVAILABLE IN THE COMMONSFOR GOVERNMENT legislation.     The number of sitting days each Session varies according to the dates of theopening of the Session and of its prorogation, and the lengths of the recesses.The number of Supply Days and Private Members&apos; days is not affected by suchvariations, and it is the Government which gains or loses from a larger or smaller number of sitting days than usual.2.    Each Session Government time has to be allowed for the Budget Debate and theFinance Bill;   for Consolidated Fund Bills;   for such matters as e.c. business, orders and Opposed private business;   and for general debate.     It is not possible to plan on the basis of devoting fewer days than usual next Session to business of this kind,eg by cutting down on general debates.    Most such business is unavoidable;   and mostgeneral debates already take place in the Opposition^ time,3.    The average number of days available for Government legislation over the last10 Sessions has been in the mid-fifties.    This number of days would not suffice for those Bills which are unavoidable next Session, or for which time must be allowed(those listed in Part I, and Part II B of Annex 3).     Next Session will, in any event,be Btarting several weeks later than usual.4.     The only way to make more time available for Government legislation next Sessionis to cut down severely on the length of recesses.     By adopting the following time-table, the number.of days expected to be available next Session for Government legis-lation can be increased to 62.    This number of days barely suffices to cater for thoseBills listed in Part I, and Part II A and S, of Annex 3.     It makes no allowance forthe contingencies which will probably arise( whether foreseen or totally unexpected,and which might require additional days for additional Bills.Wednesday, 24 NovemberMonday, 10 JanuaryMonday, 18 AprilMonday, 13 JuneTuesday, 18 October(or Monday, 17 October)Thursday, 23 DecemberThursday, 7 AprilFriday, 3 JuneFriday, 29 JulyFriday, 28 October      (Spillover)Note:   The last Party Conference ends on 14 October.(confidential)

Numbers 1-9 are the original list of Essential Bills approved by theCabinet in May. Numbers 10-12 were then Contingent but have since become essential.     The need for 13 has only emerged since May.b.   Only numbers 4^10 and 12 are regarded as sufficiently important to mention in the Speech.(confidential)
(confidential)B.    OTHER BILLS FIRMLY IN THE PROGRAMMEU.   Scotland and Wales Bill*5.   Social Security (Amendment) bill$, surcharge on employers * )national insurance contribution ^Recoupment to NHS of cost of treating road accident cases18.   Reduction of Redundancy Rebates )Job release schemeTo prevent a further rise in the earnings limit for retirement pensioners;   to reduce unemployment benefit for occupational pensioners,etc.    Now essential in order to achievepromised public expenditure savingsMeasures mentioned in the statement on 22 Julyby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and thusessential to meet promised public expendituresavingsBill to authorise payments, essential to the implementation of the scheme a. The Cabinet have agreed that the Speech shall promise &quot;legislative proposals&quot;on industrial democracy on the footing that the major legislation on this subjectwill not be enacted next Session.b. Number 15 is in the first priority list decided by the Cabinet in May.The need for numbers 16-19 has arisen since May.(confidential)
(confidential)PART IIA.   OTHER BILLS MENTIONED IN THE DRAFT OPENING SPEECH20,   Conspiracy and Criminal Law Reform^*  Water (Equalisation of Charges)Zi&apos;   PatentsPart I, on conspiracy, is very much wantedby the Trade Union movement.     Legislationnext Session has been publicly promised.Part II, on squatting, while it may arousecontroversy, is complementary to theprovisions of the Bill on homelessness.Further consideration is being given by theMinisters principally concerned to thepossibility of dropping Part III t onobscenity, which would be highly contentious;and to the possibility of including in this bill certain provisions of the criminla justice Bill concerned with law and order.Water charges are a sensitive issue in Wales,especially after the summer drought, andthere has been no criticism of these proposals in the consultative document on water.     Ifthe revised charges were to be operative fromnext April the Bill would have to reachRoyal Assent by Christmas or soon after.This should be possible, and it would be politically advantageous to mention the Billin the Speech.iIt is most important that the UK should be       !able to ratify the European Patent Convention, \for which this legislation is required, beforethe Convention comes into force next year.Failure to mention this Bill might lead tospeculation about the Government&apos;s intentions in thiB regard, which would be damaging.The Bill would be uncontroversial, andinclusion in the Speech is proposed subjectto the Oppositions agreement to SecondReading Committee procedure in the House ofCommons.(confidential)
(confidential)B.BILLS NOT IIJ THE SHAFT SPEECH. BUT FOR WHICH TIME MUSTBE ALLOWED IS THE PROGRAMMEQ*   Shipbuilding Industry (redundancy payments)24*   Coal IndustryPrice Control and Counter-InflationLikely to become necessary because of theprospects of heavy redundancies in the ship-building industry.Part of the Bill is likely to become essential, because the NCB are expected toreach the limit of their borrowing powersnext autumn.Legislation will almost certainly be neededbefore the end of July, when all existing powers will otherwise expire.C.   BILLS NOT IN THE DRAFT SPEECH OR IN THE PROGRAMME. INORDER OF PRIORITY FOR INTRODUCTION SHOULD TIME BECOME AVAILABLE26-   HoraelessnesB^7.   Occupational Pensions Schemes28*   Post Office (Amendment)29*   Exemption ClausesPassenger Vehicles (ExperimentalAreas)To place the responsibility for housing thehomeless on local housing authorities.    a quite short Bill, likely to receive a generalwelcome.    There is very little else in theprogramme concerned with social problems.To provide employee representation on boardsvia Trade Unions and to give equal status to women.     Strongly supported by the TUC,strongly opposed in part by the CBI.The draft Speech already contains a referenceto &quot;legislative proposals for the extensionof industrial democracy in the private andpublic sectors&quot;, which would cover this Bill.But it will not be possible to enact the major industrial democracy legislation next session, and decisions of policy have not yetbeen taken on the nature and timing of ascheme for industrial democracy in the PostOffice.To limit the avoidance of civil liability for breach of contract and negligence.     an attractive consumer protection measure.Could be introduced in the Lords if theOpposition agreed to Second Reading Committeeprocedure in the Commons.To permit experiments in new methods of rural transport.     Could be introduced in the lords if Opposition agreed to Second reading committee procedure in the Commons.(confidential)
(confidential)31-   Criminal Justice32.   Industrial Training33.   Merchant Shipping34.   Road Traffic (Seat Belts)Redistribution of court business, increasedmaximum fines, stricter firearms control.The law and order provisions are politicallyattractive, and might be fitted into the conspiracy Bill (see above).     Provisions onfirearms and curtailment of right to jurytrial contentious.Policy not settled and Bill not drafted.The Speech contains an undertaking to&quot;continue to promote the development ofindustrial training&quot;.Most important provisions would improve the safety of seafarers, and are wanted by thoNational Union of Seamen.     But complex and long (50 clauses even without pilotageprovisions) and no drafting done since thisis only a third priority Bill.Desirable Bill to save lives and money, butnot warranting precedence over urgentmeasures in the programme for next Session.Would need to be whipped on Government side to ensure success.(confidential)
