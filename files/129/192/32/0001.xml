DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(76) 107 COPY NO      gj16 November 1976CABINETCABINET DOCUMENT SECURITYNote by the Prime Minister1. Following the Child Benefit leak, I announced in the House on1 July the appointment of a Committee of Privy Counsellors, under lord Houghton&apos;s chairmanship, to examine the procedures for handlingCabinet and Cabinet Committee documents.    I have now received theirreport which is reproduced below.2.        I think this is in general a satisfactory report.    The Committeehave not come up with any radical proposals but the procedures they recommend should lead to some tightening up of existing practices.    Theprincipal recommendation is that a Cabinet Documents Officer should beappointed in each Department with responsibility for the operation of the procedures.    In reaffirming the application of the &quot;need to know&quot; principle to the distribution of Cabinet documents, the Committee have been at pains to take account of the complexity of modern government and therequirements of efficient administration; and I believe that they have strucka reasonable balance.3.        The report is relevant to the conclusion of the Ministerial Group on official Information, referred to in the note which I am circulatingseparately (CP(76) 108), that the Government should reject the recommenda-tion of the Franks Committee that Cabinet documents, as a class, shouldbe protected by criminal sanctions.    On the one hand, it may be argued that the Houghton Committee19 recommendations underline the specialstatus and sensitivity of Cabinet documents, thus pointing to the need for retaining the protection of criminal sanctions.    On the other hand,acceptance by the Government of the Houghton Committee (s recommendations would equally serve to underline the importance which we attach to theconfidentiality of Cabinet documents and to the doctrine of collective responsibility, even if we disagree with Franks about the need to safeguardthis by use of criminal sanctions.1
4. Unless any of my colleagues sees objection, therefore, I intend to jarrange for the report to be published and to announce that the Government jbroadly accept its recommendations. The detailed implementation of these [will, of course, require further study.LJC10 Downing Street16 November 19762
f&quot;(restricted)PRIME minister on 1 July 1976 you informed the House of Commons that you were appointing us as a Committee to examine the rules for&apos;handling Cabinet documents.    Our terms of reference were;&quot;To examine the procedures for handling cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers inside the Government,and matters arising therefrom, to see whether theseprocedures are adequate and appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the documents in question&quot;.We held our first formal meeting on 21 July 1976 and we metfor the eighth time today.    We invited 19 GovernmentDepartments to provide us with information about the presentprocedures and 7 of these we invited to join us at our variousmeetings.    The Secretary of the Cabinet also provided us with information and joined in discussion with us.    At thetime when we were appointed, the police were asked to investigate the circumstances of the alleged disclosure ofCabinet documents relating to the Child Benefit scheme.While we were not concerned with that investigation, anylessons to be drawn from it applicable to future procedureswere obviously of interest to us.    We therefore invited thepolice to discuss these aspects with us and have taken their advice into account in framing our recommendations.
It!(restricted)We record our gratitude to all those who have provided us with information and advice.    We also thank Mr Pat Benner,Department of Health and Social Security, who advised and assisted us throughout.    We have been especially fortunatein having Mr Clifford Stevens as our Secretary.    We thankhim warmly for his close and efficient attention to everyaspect of our enquiry.We submit the following Report.HODGHTON OF SOWERBY(Chairman)JOSEPH GODBEH26 October 1976.2.i

(restricted)CHAPTER 1   -   NATURE AND PURPOSE OF THE ENQUIKVWe were invited by the Prime Minister to examine the rules and procedures for handling Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents following on the clear indication that the contents of such documents relating to the child Benefit scheme had been seen by, or disclosed in some detail to,some unauthorised person.     Our terms of reference were:&quot;To examine the procedures for handling Cabinet and CabinetCommittee papers inside the Government, and matters arising therefrom,to see whether these procedures are adequate and appropriate toprotect the confidentiality of the documents in question&quot;.2.    In the course of our investigations we invited the main Departments,including all those whose Ministers are in the Cabinet, to provide us with information about their procedures for handling Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents, and we have examined the rules which are laid downby the Cabinet Office.     We have also discussed with the police what their investigations into the Child Benefit leak have brought to light inmatters of procedure.     Insofar as Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documentsbear a security classification they are subject to clear and definite instructions which apply throughout the Civil Service to the handling ofclassified documents.    These are comprehensive and are kept under continuous review.     They cover the physical custody and storage of documents, the arrangements for their preparation and reproduction, theirtransmission from place to place, and the security clearance of those withaccess to classified information.3.    We regarded it as implicit in our terms of reference that we shouldconcern ourselves with the documents of the Cabinet and its ministerial committees.     We have not considered the procedures for the handling of documents relevant to Committees composed of officials.4.    The documents with which we were concerned fall into two main categories, papers or memoranda which are circulated for discussion, andminutes which record these discussions and the decisions reached.1
(restricted)\When differences between Ministers arise or are believed to have arisen, the documents which report such differences are likely to be the most sensitive,and of most interest to those who report on our national affairs.     the handling of minutes has, therefore, figured prominently in our investigations.5.     The context of our enquiries is that of the process of government itself, the operation of which turns on the proper functioning of themachinery for Ministerial decision making at the centre.     In modern times the business of Government ranges widely over the affairs of the nation.While the Cabinet stands as the supreme policy making authority, the scale and complexity of Government requires an extensive system of cabinet committees taking decisions on behalf of the Cabinet in specific policyareas.     The need for machinery to co-ordinate Government decision making was recognised Borne 50 years ago by the establishment of the Cabinet Secretariat toarrange the business of the Cabinet and to record and notify to those concerned the decisions that had been taken.     Against the background of the considerablegrowth in Government since then, this machinery is an essential part of theprocess of Government.    Added to this is the necessity for Ministers to rely heavily on their advisers to draw attention to the inter-relationships between different areas of policy, and to implement in detail broad policy decisions.    All of this means that the deliberations of the Cabinet and its committees must be fully documented and that many people must necessarily have access to this documentation.6.    No doubt the maintenance of high standards of security is helped if themovement of papers is restricted as far as possible.     It has however to berecognised that many officials will need to handle Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents regularly.    This cannot be avoided if we want an efficient administration.     But while it is the duty of many officials to consider and advise on matters with which the Cabinet and its Committees are concerned theymust be conscious of the special responsibility they bear.     They have access to information which others would wish to have and possibly to use forpurposes not authorised or approved by Ministers.     The handling of Cabinet and cabinet Committee papers therefore rests on trust and calls for constantvigilance.2.
F(restricted)7.     Our examination of procedures in Government Departments has revealedvarying standards of control.     Some are to be commended for the care theyshow in handling the documents of the Cabinet and Cabinet Committees.     in others there is room for improvement.     The aim must be to help all departments to attain the standards of the best.     Rules are of great importance inthis respect and we deal with these in Chapter 2 of our Report.     As wehave said many officials need to handle the documents of the Cabinet and its committees and often they have to do so under considerable pressures oftime.     Not all of them are of equal sensitivity and moments of slackness maycreep into the rigours of routine-when time is short.    Familiarity must not,however, be allowed to breed neglect.     All concerned must stick to therules and never let up.    A high degree of responsibility is always required.8.     We have been fortunate in our public service that such an attitude has long been traditional.     It is essential that nothing should be done to weaken it.    A lead from the top is of first importance.    The permanent secretary of each Department has a special responsibility to ensure that thearrangements in his Department are effective and to show that he expects therules to be properly applied.     Above all Ministers must accept their own responsibility.     When one&apos;s views are being disputed by one&apos;s colleagues inthe Cabinet, the temptation to drop a word to a backbencher here dr ajournalist there is very real.    There cannot, however, be one standard forthe spoken word and another for the written vord.     Our public servants ingeneral maintain a very high standard for the protection of the written word.That standard has to be maintained by example as well as instruction.3.
(restricted)CHAPTER 2 - THE 1IA11DLING OS1 CABINET AHD CABINET COMMITTEE DOCUMENTSTHE MAIN ISSUES9.     So far we have discussed the contert of our enquiry and we have described the operational considerations which need to he home in mind.   We wereconscious of the need to find a balance between the requirements of securityon the one hand, and the operational needs of Ministers and their departments on the other.   In other words the rules have to be workable in practice.   Thereis first of all the contents of the infoiraationcontainecL in documents.   As ageneral proposition it must be true that the more sensitive the material whichis distributed, the greater the possibility that security may be breached.Equally as the area over which this material is disseminated widens, so therisk of breakdown in security procedures increases.   We therefore considered,as a preliminary, the question of the contents of documents.   We then consideredthe area of distribution, before turning to procedures for the control of distribution,CONTENTS OF DOCUHEHTS10,     As we said in Chapter 1, when differences between Ministers and Departmentsarise, or are believed to have arisen, the documents which report suchdifferences are likely to be of special interest, and they may therefore be atspecial risk.   Although we were principally concerned with the handling of documents, we naturally wondered whether the circulation of records of meetingsreporting the details of Ministerial discussions is necessary to the purposesof administration.   If the minutes of meetings were limited to a brief record of the conclusions reached, this would remove at source the possibility of seriousmischief arising from the mishandling of these documents.   However our enquirieshave satisfied us that the circulated conclusions of meetings of the Cabinet andits Committees appear to provide an acceptable balance between what Ministerswish to place on the record, and what it is probably necessary for a restrictedcircle of people to know in order to understand what they are required to do.4(restricted)
(restricted)AREA OP DISTRIBUTION11.The Weed to. Know.The Radcliffe Committee stressed the overriding importance of the &quot;need to know&quot; principle, under which classified information should he disseminated no wider than is required for the efficient dischargeapply to the documentation of the Cabinet and its Ministerial Committees,whatever its security classification.   It means that no one other than amember of the Cabinet or one of its Committees has any right to know unless this is essential to the proper discharge of his duties.   The &quot;need to know&quot;is, as the Radcliffe Committee observed, easier to state than to apply; itcannot be reduced to a routine set of rules or tests for mechanical application.The exercise of judgement is required in each case on the basis of the contents of each particular document.   We accept that this is a judgement which can onlybe made in each individual Department.   Our investigations did not satisfy us that the &quot;heed to know&quot; principle is applied with sufficient strictness in everyDepartment.12.   Regular Access.   We were informed that it is the practice in a number of departments for all the memoranda and minutes of the Cabinet to be circulatedto certain individuals regularly and as a matter of course irrespective of whether the subject matter directly concerns the responsibilities of theparticular Department,   We have been informed that such access may be enjoyed by junior Ministers, certain senior permanent advisers and, in some Departments,Special Advisers.   It does not seem to us that the regular circulation ofCabinet documents can be justified unless those concerned have responsibilities which go beyond the policy boundaries of their own Department.   Since only theMinister himself can say whether this is so, it must be for him to determine the&quot;need to know&quot; in such circumstances.   We therefore recommend that the minutesand memoranda of the Cabinet should not be shown regularly to anyone within a department except on the specific instruction of the Minister to whom the documents arc issued.   Before issuing such an instruction, the Minister should(i) Security Procedures in the Public Service (Cmnd 1681, paragraph 110),of the business in hand.(i)We are in no doubt that this principle should5
](restricted)satisfy himself that such circulation is clearly justified, whether it is tojunior Ministers in his Department, to his senior permanent advisers, or to special Advisers.   Additionally, we think that whatever regular circulation ofthis kind is authorised by the Minister, it should he reported to the Secretaryof the Cabinet.   We therefore recommend that each Minister should arrange forthe names of al?L those with regular access to the documents of the Cabinet andof its most sensitive Committees to be sent to the Secretary of the Cabinet,13.     Selective Access.      While very few officials need to see all documents, itis inevitable for the reasons we mentioned in Chapter 1 that a large number of officials need access to certain information at certain times.   They thereforeneed to see particular memoranda.   Our impression was &quot;that the selectivecirculation of memoranda is restricted tightly.   The fact that Departments maynot make further copies of memoranda circulated by the Cabinet Office helps tokeep tight control, though difficulties can arise for Departments when memorandaare circulated at short notice.   We revert to this in paragraph 15 below.Officials may also need to see that part of the minutes of a meeting concernedwith a particular memorandum.   For this purpose Departments are permitted tomake photocopies of the relevant parts or &quot;extracts&quot; of minutes.   It was put tous that this practice accords with the &quot;need to know&quot;, insofar as it enablesDepartments to circulate information which concerns them, while not circulatingother information contained in the same set of minutes which does not concernthem,   Nevertheless vie had to view the practice with some concern, because ofthe freedom which it gives Departments to multiply copies.   We deal later inour report with the conditions which we think should apply to the making andcirculation of such extracts.   At this point we stress that the &quot;need to know&quot;principle should be applied to extracts no less strictly than to the other categories of document concerned.   It is inconsistent with this principle forextracts of minutes to be made and distributed simply as a matter of routineto those who may have been involved or consulted in the preparation of advice to the Minister.   A separate judgement should be made in each case as to whorequires to know the contents of the minutes; it does not follow that all whowere consulted at an earlier stage have this need.6(restricted)
(restricted)METHODS OF CONTROL AND PROCEDURES14.Production and Initial Circulation of Documents.     Many of the categories of documents with which we were concerned, including those whichare likely to be the more sensitive, are reproduced in the Cabinet Office;and we inspected the very thorough security arrangements which are in forcein the office of the Secretary of the Cabinet and in the Cabinet Officetyping pool.     The Cabinet Office is responsible, on behalf of the PrimeMinister, for determining the circulation lists for Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents.     It is important that these lists are kept under constant review so that documents are not circulated more widely than is absolutely necessary.     The area of circulation will always tend to grow;   periodicalpruning is therefore desirable.15.     Difficulties can arise for Departments whose main offices are outside london, particularly if memoranda are not circulated in sufficiently good time before a meeting.     It may be necessary in such circumstances, if themeeting cannot be postponed, for special arrangements to be agreed between departments and the Cabinet Office.     Two Departments told us of difficulties that arose from time to time because of the restrictions on the number of copies of a memorandum they were allowed.     If Departments genuinely need afurther copy of a particular document they should ask for one.     If theiradditional requirements are really necessary they can be met.     All that is needed is closer liaison between the Cabinet Office and Departments.     we hope that our proposals will help to bring this about.16.     Administrative Machinery in Departments.     We found significantvariations in Departmental machinery for handling Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents, and for applying ths rules laid down by the cabinet office.     In some Departments all such documents received in the department are handled in one central section irrespective of which Minister in theDepartment is the authorised recipient.     This section decides access tothe documents, maintains records of their movements, and is responsible fortheir eventual return and custody.     In other Departments these functions maybe carried out by the Private Office of whichever Minister in the Department isthe authorised recipient of the document in question.     In such cases there maythus be two or more sources for the circulation of documents and no specificmachinery for co-ordinating their arrangements.     In general (though there were
(restricted)exceptions) we found that those called upon to operate the procedures did noti        have their responsibilities clearly defined and received little instructionabout their responsibilities for the safe handling of Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents, apart from inheriting a copy of the written Cabinet Officeinstructions and perhaps receiving oral advice from their predecessors.   We donot think that this is enough.   Clearer allocation of responsibilities is needed.17.     Cabinet Documents Officer.     In evidence to us, the Cabinet Officesuggested that in each Department one official should have direct responsibilityfor the operation of the procedures, who might be known as the Cabinet DocumentsOfficer.   We support this proposal which would provide the basis for theclarification and centralisation of responsibility which vie recommend.IS.     The Cabinet Documents Officer would have overall&apos; responsibility for thearrangements for the receipt, distribution and custody of all Cabinet and cabinet Committee documents.   It would be for him to determine who, other thanthose to whom the documents are formally issued, should have access.   In thet       circumstances we discussed in paragraph 12 above, he should act on the explicitinstructions of his tlinister.   In all other cases he should apply his ownjudgement on the basis of the strict application of the &quot;need to know&quot; principle.While he may wish to take advice from senior officials in the Department inparticular instances we would regard it as essential to his authority that hisdecisions on access should be final subject only to the overriding directions of his Minister or Permanent Secretary.   Senior officials need some measure of discretion to.show particular documents to selected members of their staff.This would not conflict with our approach, provided that such discretion is exercised in strict accordance with the &quot;need to know&quot;, and only under theconditions, including those about the recording of access, to which we referlater.19.    The operation of the control procedures applying to Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents should be the clear responsibility of the Cabinet DocumentsOfficer,   He would no doubt maintain close liaison with his Departmental SecurityOfficer on matters of physical and document security and may wish to enlist hishelp in enquiring into possible breaches of the rules, or in satisfying hinself,perhaps by means of spot checks, that they are being observed.(restricted)
(restricted)20,     We would expect the Cabinet Documents Officer in most Departments to bea Private Secretary to the Minister in charge of the Department.     But this isa matter of internal Departmental organisation on which we do not seek to lay down a hard and fast rule.     What is important is that the Cabinet DocumentsOfficer should have and be known to have a position and status in the Departmentto enable him to exercise the functions we have here described.     He would bethe normal point of contact with the Cabinet Office on matters of procedure.21.     It will be easier for the concept of the Cabinet Documents Officer to beapplied in those Departments where all Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documentsare handled by one central point xegardless of which Minister in the department is the authorised recipient.     But we think that other Departments should review their organisation with a view to introducing a more centralised system undera single Cabinet Documents Officer.     It seems to us that this would haveoperational benefits as well as increasing security by reducing the number of points from which documents may be distributed.    Exceptionally, there may becompelling reasons for lesB centralised arrangements.     The precise way in whichthese organisational proposals are applied should be discussed and agreed withthe Cabinet Office.22.     Physical Protection of Documents.     So far, we have been concerned withthe regulation of access to documents.     The physical protection of documentsis dealt with in detail in the standing security instructions.     In this partof the Report we discuss certain additional procedures we think should apply tothe handling of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents.2J.     Transmission of Documents.     Many Departments circulate Cabinet and cabinet Committee memoranda from one office to another in distinctive foldersto draw attention to the need for careful handling and to convey operationalinstructions.     We commend this practice and recommend that it should befollowed by all Departments.    We further recommend that similar folders should&apos;be used for the circulation of extracts of minutes.     It would be convenient for suitable brief instructions on the handling of the documents, includinginstructions about the recording of access, to which we refer in paragraph 2kbelow, to be plainly printed on these folders.9.(restricted)
(restricted)24.     Records of Access.     The practice of copy numbering Cabinet and CabinetCommittee documents provides the basis for proper document security providedthat records are kept of access to each numbered copy.   From the enquiries we made of Departments we were not confident that record systems are alwayscomprehensive, for example where documents are passed or shown by one officialto another.   We think that it should be a general principle that the location of any Cabinet or Cabinet Committee document, including an extract from minutes, can at any time be ascertained from the records kept by the cabinet documents Officer or his staff.   To this end there should be detailedinstructions requiring the names of recipients of documents to be recorded,and for the movement of documents from one official to another to be notified to the Cabinet Documents Officer or his staff and recorded.   If any officialother than the recipient, including junior officials and secretarial staff,sees the document but does not have it in his possession, his name should alsobe recorded on the folder in which the document is transmitted and therebyconveyed to the Cabinet Documents Officer.   The registerskept by the cabinet documents Officer should provide a complete record of access to and the location of each document.25,     Retention of Documents and Filing.   We have stressed the importance ofthe strict adherence to the &quot;need to know&quot; principle.   Close attention shouldalso be paid to the &quot;need to retain&quot;.   Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documentsshould not be retained a moment longer than is necessary for an officialadequately to discharge his responsibilities.   We accept that the appropriateperiod of time will varyj in some cases a document can be read and returnedimmediately, in other cases it may need to be kept for a considerable period.Some Departments whose procedures we have examined have efficient monitoringarrangements desigied to secure the recall of Cabinet and Cabinet Committeedocuments at the earliest opportunity.   Under our proposals it would be theresponsibility of the Cabinet Documents Officer to establish arrangements ofthis nature? they should provide for a regular check to be made of all outstanding docuncnts.10(restricted)
(restricted)26.    A related question is the practice, which is in accordance with thepresent rules, of placing certain Cabinet and Cabinet Committee memoranda andextracts of minutes on the registered files of Departments,     It seemed to us that this may extend access more widely than necessary since officials notneeding to see a particular Cabinet or Cabinet Committee document may needaccess for another purpose to a file containing it.   Moreover it detracts fromthe principle of personal accountability for the custody of a numbereddocument.   We have found marked variations in departmental practices in thismatter.   A number of Departments do not allow the placing of these documents on registered files, without apparent detriment to administrative efficiency;some allow filing in special circumstances, in others it appears to be frequentpractice for Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents to be filed.   We recommendthat neither Cabinet nor Cabinet Committee memoranda, nor extracts of minutesshould be placed on registered files.   If it is necessary for working purposes for a document to be retained for a period, it should be held in the personalcustody of the official to whom it is issued and access to it recorded.   when necessary, a brief note could, no doubt be placed, on tho relevant registeredfile recording a specific decision or a reference to a particular Cabinet orCabinet Committee document.27.     Copying of Extracts of Minutes.   We have already referred to the factthat the freedom given to Departments to make further copies of extracts of minutes represents a potential weakening of the security which derives fromlimiting the circulation of a document to a specific quantity of numberedcopies.   It is therefore most important that careful attention should be paidto the security of the copying process.   We recommend that copies of extractsshould be made only on the authority of the Cabinet Documents Officer, who should satisfy himself that the appropriate security instructions relating tothe photocopying of papers are followed.   It is already a requirement that each copy go made should be numbered.   Beyond this we were impressed by thepractice of one Department where each page of the complete copy of an extractis distinctively marked by means of a coloured stamp.   We regard this deviceas a valuable additional safeguard and recommend its adoption by all Departments.11
(restricted)28.     Limited Circulation Annexes.     In his statement to Parliament of1 July 1976 announcing the appointment of this Committee, the Prime minister referred to the use of Limited Circulation Annexes to record certain discussions in the Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee.     Access to such a document is tightlyrestricted and any officials who need to see it must do so in the PrivateOffice of the Minister concerned.     Limited Circulation Annexes should never be photocopied.     This is a strict rule, but it is clear that it has beenbreached by some Departments in the past.     Our recommendations on the recordingof access to documents apply equally to Limited Circulation Annexes,     Althoughcopies of this category of document may not be made, our discussions with departments revealed that officials who have to take subsequent action may makenotes&quot; of the contents of a Limited Circulation Annex.     This facility whileprobably being unavoidable nevertheless weakens the degree of security whichmay be thought to attach to the Limited Circulation Annex procedure.29.     Other Safeguards.     We record three further suggestions which were put to us.     One is that documents of particular sensitivity should be reproduced in a distinctive way so as to draw attention to the need for special handling;perhaps by the use of coloured paper, or paper containing a boldly printedlegend.     Another is that it should be a rule that Cabinet and Cabinet Committeedocuments should not be folded.     Evidence of folding would then suggest theneed for enquiry into possible mishandling.     The third is that the records of access to which we refer in paragraph 2h above should be entered indelibly in abound book rather than in a loose leaf binder.     We recommend that furtherconsideration should be given to these suggestions.ROLE OF THE CABINET OFFICE30.     We have referred in paragraph 15 to the need for closer liaison betweenthe Cabinet Office and Departments on matters relating to document procedures.Our enquiries have led us to the conclusion that the handling of Cabinet and cabinet Committee documents is sufficiently important to justify a continuingdegree of oversight by the Cabinet Office of departmental practices in orderto ensure -a. that adequate standards are being maintained;   and b. that so far as possible there is uniformity in the application ofthe rules.12.(restricted)
w(restricted)To this end we make the following recommendations.   The Cabinet Office should draw up comprehensive and detailed procedural instructions incorporating thepresent rules and such of our proposals as may be acceptable, for applicationthroughout Departments.   They should embody in one document all the rulesabout the handling of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents and ifsubsequent changes are found to be necessary, these should be made throughspecific amendment of those instructions.   We recommend that each department should incorporate the instructions in its aim local rules addressed to itsown circumstances,   tfe further recommend that these local rules should be approved by the Cabinet Office.   Finally, we recommend that arrangements be madefor the Cabinet Office to interview each Cabinet Documents Officer onappointment and at intervals thereafter in order to explain at first hand thepurpose and effect of the procedural instructions.(restricted)
(restricted)CHAPTER 3 - SUMMING UP AND CONCLUSIONS31.     Our task was to see whether the procedures for handling Cabinet and cabinet Committee papers inside the Government were adequate and appropriate to protect the confidentiality of the documents in question.     We have reviewed the present procedures and have proposed changes and additions to tighten up the procedures in a number of respects.     The principal areas inwhich we make recommendations are as follows:a. the application of the &quot;need to know&quot; principle to the circulation of documents and the conditions we think should applywhere there is regular access to certain categories of documents,(paragraphs 12 and 13).b. the administrative machinery in Departments;   we recommend the appointment of Cabinet Documents Officers (paragraphs 17 to 21).c. the physical protection of documents;   we make recommendations on the transmission of documents (paragraph 23), the detailedrecording of access to them (paragraph 2k), their retention andthe question of filing (paragraphs 25 and 26) and on the copying ofextracts of minutes (paragraph 27).d. the role of the Cabinet Office (paragraph 30).None of this means that we have found standards of security to be generallylow.     Far from it.     We have already recorded our view that our public servants in general maintain a very high standard for the protection of the written word.     To a large extent our proposals represent a bringing togetherof the best of the existing practices.14(restricted)
(restricted)32.     But we repeat, rules are only part of the story.     The continuedmaintenance of a high standard of responsibility on the part of everyonewho handles Cabinet and Cabinet Committee documents is of overriding importance.     We do not think the simple promulgation of a set of rulesis enough.     All concerned need to be reminded of them and to keep themwell in mind all the time.     Periodical reminders should be issued fromtime to time and a new appointment to the post of Cabinet Documents Officermight provide a suitable occasion for a further reminder.33-     We emphasised at the outset the need for a strong lead from the top.The proposals we have made do not in any way detract from the special responsibility which rests on Permanent Secretaries to take a personalinterest in and demonstrate a personal concern for the needs of security.Ministers above all must set a high standard by their own example.     Thesafe handling of papers in their Departments is their responsibility.15(restricted)
