DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 992 November 1976CABINETREGIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer. The Secretary cf State for Industry has made proposals to the ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy for additional expenditure on selective assistance to industry.    This expenditure, whichwas foreshadowed in my statement in the House of Commons on 22 July,would take the form of additional finance for the National Enterprise Boardand the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, provision for new schemesfor discretionary assistance in support of the industrial strategy and additional finance for British Shipbuilders.    His proposals are estimated to cost  90 million in 1977-78,  142 million in 1978-79,  195 million in1979-80 and  216 million in 1980-81.    Details are set out in Annex A.He also proposed changes in non-selective regional incentives, taking accountof a PAR report, which would, if agreed, contribute savings towards thecost of his expenditure proposals.2.        The Committee considered the proposed changes in regional incentivesbut were not in agreement with them.    In particular there was a clear majority against the major proposal that Regional Employment Premiumshould be ended in the Development Areas from October 1977.    In discussionvarious possible other sources of savings were identified, notably -a. introducing some selectivity into Regional Development Grant(RDG), particularly so as to limit payments in respect of verylarge projects which have little flexibility in location;b. some reductions in the level of RDG in Intermediate andDevelopment Areas;c. a review of the boundaries of the Assisted Areas with aview to some reduction in coverage.The majority of the Committee considered that these possibilities were worthfurther study but that it would be wrong to take decisions in such animportant area until this study had been completed.    In any event it seemed unlikely that they could give rise to substantial savings as early as theincreased expenditure proposed by the Secretary of State for Industry.copy NO     r AO i
3.        Several members of the Committee felt that there was also a case for reviewing the tax allowances available to industry to see if they couldbe made more selective.    Any change here would not of course reducepublic expenditure.4.        The Secretary of State for Industry wishes to maintain bis proposalsfor increased expenditure.    The Cabinet is accordingly invited to consider them on the basis that, if agreed, they would have to be offset by savings on other programmes.    One possible source of offsetting savings discussed bythe Committee is a reduction which the Post Office have decided to make intheir capital programme, which will reduce their borrowing requirement by 200 million over the three years 1978-79 to 1980-81.     There are, however,difficulties about offsetting these reductions against increased expenditure on other programmes, and I am submitting a separate paper by the chief secretary on this point.D W treasury Chambers2 November 19762
