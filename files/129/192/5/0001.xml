DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ government cp(76) 80 COPY NO      SI21 September 1976CABINETRHODESIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign and commonwealth affairs. On 9 September I gave the Cabinet an oral account of Dr Kissinger *activities over Rhodesia (CM(76) 23rd Conclusions, Minute 1),    Since thenevents have moved quite rapidly.2.        When Dr Kissinger called on the Prime Minister on 6 September,after his meeting with Mr Vorster in Zurich, he said that Mr Vorster had gone away to consider the ideas which we and the Americans had worked outtogether for bringing about a peaceful transfer of power in Rhodesia, but hadnot undertaken to help put them into effect.   He had however indicated thatif he did give such an undertaking he would wish to work through lan Smithin the first place.    Dr Kissinger clearly felt that, if this were the price ofobtaining Mr Vorster&apos;s co-operation, it had to be paid.    The Prime Ministerwarned him of the risk of Smith embroiling the Americans in negotiation, andof the difficulties this would create with the African Presidents.3.        Dx Kissinger began another visit to Africa on 14 September.   during his discussions in Dar es Salaam, President Nyerere was pessimistic aboutthe chances of promoting a Rhodesian settlement, chiefly because, instead oftalking, as he had previously done, of getting rid of Smith, Dr Kissinger was now thinking in terms of persuading Smith to accept majority rule.   However,President Nyerere did not raise objections to Dr Kissinger going on with hisplan.    Dr Kissinger^ subsequent meeting with President Kaunda went much better, and he felt that he had Kaunda&apos;s full support and encouragement,4.        On 14 September Mr Vorster saw Ian Smith in Pretoria.    As a resultof this meeting he apparently told Dr Kissinger, on the latter&apos;s arrival inPretoria, that he believed the proposals could be launched, through Smith.After lengthy meetings with Mr Vorster, Dr Kissinger decided to see Smithhimself, which he did on 19 September,
5.        Immediately after these meetings, Dr Kissinger told us that smith had said that, subject to consulting his Cabinet colleagues and his Partycaucus, he would be prepared to make publicly an &quot;offer&quot; on the lines ofthe draft annexed to this paper.    He would do this towards the end of thisweek.    Dr Kissinger has now gone to inform Presidents Nyerere andKaunda of this, and will seek to persuade them that this document is agood basis on which to negotiate the transfer of power, and that theyshould publicly welcome it.    He is coming to London thereafter, and Ishall be having a meeting with him on Friday morning, 24 September.6.        Dr Kissinger is rightly conscious of the need to act quickly if thereis to be any hope of negotiation and a peaceful settlement, and I have told him more than once how much we welcome his energetic approach to theproblem.    But his tactics over the last week or two leave a number of questions unanswered and may have created certain difficulties.    It maybe, for example, that Smith has seen and taken an opportunity to make useof the proposals that have been explained to him in order to gain somefreedom of manoeuvre for himself.   It does not eeem that Dr Kissingernow has any control over what Smith may announce, or the extent to whichhe may now try to bargain.    It may be that the African Presidents andKhodesian Nationalists will be so suspicious of the arrangement that dr Kissinger believes he has set up, that they will refuse to go along with it; or they may disagree amongst themselves and fail to produce anadequately united black Rhodesian group to pick up the &quot;offer&quot; if it is made.7,        As regards the &quot;offer&quot; itself, our understanding from whatDr Kissinger has told us is that, although the document is rather curiouslydrafted as if it reflected some sort of agreement between Smith and theUnited States and British Governments, his intention is that Smith shouldindeed put these ideas forward as an offer.    If he fails to do so, andimplies that we are in some way committed to action, we shall have tomake it clear publicly that while we welcome the acceptance of majority rule in two years and the undertaking to negotiate with black leaders, we regard the third paragraph as simply a basis for negotiation and it is notwhat we would propose ourselves; and paragraphs 4 and 5 refer to actionswhich may or may not follow on a satisfactory outcome of the negotiation between whites and blacks.8*        Dr Kissinger may elucidate some of these points when we meetnext Friday,    My approach is however one of extreme caution.   At theBame time, we must be prepared to deal with events as they occur.   Forexample, if Smith does not play Dr Kissinger false, we should be preparedto engage in further detailed planning with the Americans of the way inwhich a negotiation might be set in train and an interim government producedwhich would see Rhodesia through to elections for majority rule and^dependence.    If it seemed appropriate and necessary, we might have toconsider ourselves arranging some form of constitutional conference which2
would help to carry the process forward.    We should also have to consider,with the Americans and others, what form of financial support friendlygovernments might wish to give an independent Zimbabwe,9.        In all this we must continue to be guided by the principles laiddown in the Prime Minister&apos;8 statement of 22 March when he was foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,    In particular, nothing can be done untiland unless the principle of majority rule is accepted, and it is agreed matit will take place in a short period of time, say l  to 2 years.10.       hi addition we must not allow ourselves to be caught up in anylengthy negotiation.    For this reason among others, while we must not be wholly negative, we should be cautious of calling a constitutional conference.Above all we must refuse to accept any direct involvement, whetheradministrative or military, in the government of Rhodesia during the run up to independence.    But subject to these caveats, we should givestrong support to these efforts which Dr Kissinger is making.A foreign and Commonwealth Office21 September 19763
