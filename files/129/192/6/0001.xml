FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS OP THE AMERICAN PROPOSALSFOR A RHOIESIAN SETTLEMENTNote by Officials&quot;the meeting of the GEN 12 Committee on 28 July, Ministers first consideredProposals designed to secure a settlement of   the Rhodesian problem?   Thefinancial provisions of the latest version of -the Rogers Plan envisage -i*    external support for the economy generally of an independent Rhodesia;and ii.   assurances to those sections of the European population in Rhodesiawho might be most apprehensive of the consequences of a settlement about&quot;their future, and the future value of their assets, firm enough to induce them to support the negotiation of majority rule within two years and simultaneously to encourage them not to depart abruptly from Rhodesia,causing a catastrophic deterioration of the Rhodesian economy,conclusions of the GEN 12 Committee&apos;s meeting were that wa could agree witha nximber of elements in the plan but that we should proceed cautiously, reportingto the Committee at each stage; and that we should not accept any financialtowards the cost of the scheme until the United States Government had^ovn that they could substantiate Ttr Kiasingor*s offer to contribute up to-** Per cent of tho ccsto2*    The purpose of this papdr is to provide Ministers with as accurate an^sessmant as can be made at present of the financial implications of the American^Posals, but especially to draw ministers attention to the major potential^i&amp;biiitiea for Britain and the need to contain them within acceptable limits,^*    Since the meeting of the GEN 12 Committee on 28 July, Dr Kissinger has hadaeiies of talks with Presidents Nyorore and Kaunda, Mr Vorater and Mr Smith and* consequence the ideas in the original plan have been modified.   Although theOrleans have stressed that the financial elements in the plan have been oanvassed011 a purely illustrative basis, it will clearly become progressively moredifficult for them to withdraw the main principles of these elements if the^Qral line of the plan proves to be acceptable.   Moreover Dr Kissinger haspllolic3y suggested that the United Kingdom be regarded as being in the lead
In organising international financial support for implementing the proposals-Figures have appeared in the Press to suggest that the Americans have in mind a fund the size of $1-2 &quot;billion.   But there is no firm basis for assuming thatany finanoial contribution will In fact be available from other countries;the potential financial commitment is largo and, on the basis of the proposals as they stand) doubtfully oontroliableo  Further discussions pursued on thebasis of liiese proposals might imply an increasing moral commitment on our partin -Uieir supports   She point will very soon be reached at which, in the course offurther consultation with the United States and South african Governments, HerMajestyfs Government should define precisely the extent to which it would beprepared to accept financial commitments in relation to these proposals.Costs of the Rogers Plan4*    The latest version of the plan envisages that its whole effect should be to afford undertakings of external support for the Rhodesian economy, includingassurances for certain categories,of the European Rhodeaian population, by theestablishment of a Fund to which a number of countries (possibly the United-States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and South Afrioa) would be invited tocontribute.   The United Kingdom would be expected to organise the Fund and takethe ohair at meetings of the participants.   It is envisaged that the life ofthe Fund, initially at least, would be limited to 5 years.5*    The proposals as thay stand are much too vague to be aoourately costod;indeed the United States officials have deliberately kept them so at this stagerso as to avoid the implication that the United States, or any other countries,have assumed definite finanoial liabilities.   As the plan is propounded, any british development aid would be part of the Fund and a direot and fixedcontribution to It? but the resources required by the Fund to the extent thatthis covers assurances to sections of -the European population would depend uponthe ability and willingness of the Zimbabwe Government to fulfil its own obligateunder &quot;the plan and, in particular, to make available foreign exchange for phased;remittances abroad of Buropoans8 liquid assets.6%    Studies of the probable state of the Zimbabwe economy after independence and -the lifting of sanctions suggest that, provided that the transition had baeffpeaceful, Zimbabwe might initially be able to afford foreign exchange forremittances abroad to the extent of about  10 million -  15 million a year.Although it might bo expected that with orderly eoonomic development this amount2
oould bo increased In later yeare it would still be a negligible contributionto the foreign exchange which might be required in the worst oase (seaParagraph 11 below)*7.    The asauranoee - outlined in the Rogers Plan relate to tho underwriting of.U public service superannuation benefits, and ii. remittances resulting mainly from a etmdby purchase facilitiy for ovner-ocoupled houses end farmB.  the consequent financial liabilities would vary enormously with the degree to whichthe Zimbabwe Government carried out their own obligations and as a result(inter alia of their adoption of reasonable polioiea, the plan succeeded in itsobjeotive of containing European emigration.   On the most favourable assumptions,*e Zimbabwe economy would at least be in a stable, if not flourishing state, andoondltiona of service for civil and other public servants would be maintained,-tfrioenisation would be gradual and a good market for houses and even for farmswatained.   On the least favourable assumptions, the economy would deteriorate,*-ropean oonfidenoe would collapse and -Ifcere would be early and heavy emigration;and the Zimbabwe Government would either repudiate responsibility for EuropeanPensions or withhold remittance facilities for them and for the proceeds of sale,**ettier privately or to the Corporations which it is proposed to establish forthe purpose, of houses and farms *tensions8*    On the beat assumptions, there need be little or no charge to the Fund forWWio eorvioes pensions.  On the worst, which would imply early repudiation of*ts obligations by the Zimbabwe Government, (and assuming, as we consider essential,*at the PundU undertakings do not cover the right of commutation), the Fund^ttld have to meet an immediate annual pensions charge&quot; - including the fundedfc*astatal and looal authority pensions - of a marl mum of  45 million, which^Uld not decline signifioantly over the five years of the life of the Fund.Ministers will no doubt wish to bear in mind that it would hardly be possible,**- Practice, to cease payments after five years, and that there would be a^tinuing liability for such pensions extending over a period of up to*0 years.**dttanoee9*   On -the best assumptions, the Corporations established for the standby***cha8o of houses and farms would do very Uttle Iweiness. But here it 1bPessary to enter the reservation that the Rogers Plan, in presaging merely* Standby facility for tfte purchase of European owner-occupied farms, Is oertainlySECFtET
unrealistic   Some Africans may be able to purchase smaller European farms with .their own resources, but it seams most improbable that large-scale transferscould take place without an officially-funded scheme on the Kenyan model; andno black majority Zimbabwe Government would countenance the use of itsrevenues, and the extension of remittance facilities, for the acquisition of nearly 50 per cent of Hhodesian territory.  We suggest, therefore, that Ministersbase their decisions on the expectation that the whole foroign exchange cost of farm purchase (a limit for remittance of  50,000 for each of tha 5,000 Europeanfarmers being imposed) would fall on the Fund - a maximum of  250 million.On the beat assumptions, perhaps only about  50 million would fall on the Fundduring tfte putative five years of its life, but again it is difficult to believethat the process could suddenly stop at the end of five years.10.  Houses are a different case.  Experience in almost all other african countries suggests that, for various reasons, houses will be in great demandafter independence.   On the best assumptions, it may genuinely be expectedthat the relatively small number of emigrating Europeans would sell theirproperties wiUiout difficulty, either privately or to the Corporation.  Evenon the worst assumptions, there may be little real difficulty in the selling ofthe propertiob,   but if the Zimbabwe Government suspended remittance facilities .a liability of  500 million (assuming a limit of  10,000 per family) would fallon the Fund, and in the circumstances foreseen, the whole of this could accruewithin the 5-^ear life of the Fund,Summary11*   The potential financial liabilities on the Fund may be summarised asfollows.   Co-lumna a. and b. assume that the Rogers Plan subsists for five years^/Column o. indicates the total potential financial liability of the proposals in the plan.4

The cost to the United Kingdom, whioh might bektadled separately from the Fund should be manageable,,It is difficult to judge whioh is the more likely outcome between theset*o extreme assumptions.   Much will depend on the attitude adopted by anindependent Zimbabwe Government and how it responds to pressure from theinternational community in the direction of moderation.   It is to be expeotedtkat the Fund will bear the full coat of takeover of the farms.   As to pensions,new Government may be enoouraged toward repudiation by the knowledge that international financing exists but the timing of the liabilities falling on theis uncertain.   On housing, it seems reasonable to hope that the norst outcome*iU not be realised.   On the basis of the later version of the Rogers ProposalsWever, the annual incidence of expenditure for all three commitments would be^controllable.*WUA1 INCIDENCE OF THE COSTS13.     On the best assumptions (paragraph 11, ool a. above) the inoldence of thetotal cost of  50 million might be evenly spread over the five years of the initial existence of the Fund.   On the worst assumptions under the Rogers Plan(Column b.), the total oost of  775 million over the fivo years of its life
would be likely to fall heavily in the first two years.   The incidence of thetotal potential liability of  1,550 million under Column c. of paragraph 11 wouldepend upon the stage at whloh the Zimbabwe Government repudiated its pensionsliabilities and suspended remittances, and on the rate at which the countriesunderwriting the soheme agreed to finance remittances.   If repudiation ofpensions- and suspension of remittances occurred at an early stage, the oostto tee proposed Fund In the first year oould be between  100^ 150 million,deollnlng to nil after 4.0 years.Limitation of United Kingdom Liability&quot;Wf.    Against this background, and as noted In paragraph 3 above, the question arises whether HM Government should now define more preoisely the extent to whiit would be prepared to acoept financial liabilities in relation  to theseproposals.   Moreover, as it seems inevitable that the United Kingdom would bein the role of organiser of international finanoial support, we should neoesshave to be prepared to say at the outset what we. were prepared to contributeourselves.   There are various theorstioal possibilities.   The main ones might beI. To single out one item of the package for a British commitment. Thishowever is hardly practicable, since many of the elements of the soheme arelinked together by the rules for remittances, it la also inadvisable, sinIf we took responsibility for one item only it is conceivable that It might be only guarantee which was invoked, and thus the United Kingdom oould be only participant to be obliged to pay anything,II, To offer to contribute a specific percentage of the total oost of tfasoheme, provided that others made up the balance. This would ensure that other countries did not contribute the remainder, the United Kingdom would no liabilities of any kind. But it would leave us in doubt about the full extent of our commitment, In terms both of total costs- and their timing.ill. To plaoe an annual cash limit on our contribution. This seems essespecially as other potential contributors must be expeoted to do the sameparagraph 17 below. But it does not protect our position If others do notcontribute.Iv.    To offer to contribute up to a specific percentage of the total (say,15 per oent) or a speoifio amount (say  15 million a year for 5 years in first instance), whichever was less.   On the whole, this seems the leastunsatisfactory of the various alternatives.   15 per cent would be more6
would be appropriate for the United Kingdom, on a GNP basis, In a fullyinternational aid-giving operation.   (8 or 9 per cent would be nearer theaark),   A figure of 15 per cent would imply that few other oountries wouldjartioipate, apart from the United States.    15 million a year for 5 years,with a 15 per cent share, would imply a total Fund of  500 million for theWhole operation for that period - ie a figure two-thirds ofthe total on the worst assumption, see table in paragraph 11.   But weshould need to stress that these figures were only tentative at thisBtage, and would need to be further considered in the light of the natureof any settlement and the oiroumstanoea at the time.Additional financial considerations for the United Kingdom^5* ^ We also need to bear in mind that the foregoing costings leave out of^count three major considerations -i.    Debt repudiation    The Rhodesian Governmenfs debts to HUGand to private stockholders in the United Kingdom now total well over 100 million.    In any Rhodesian settlement, we shall have to insist thatthe new government formally acknowledges responsibility for these debts.On the best assumptions, the debts should be a first charge on the newOcvemmenfs resources (although they may have to be suitably rescheduled).On the worst assumptions they would probably be repudiated.   In the formercase, there might be rather more room than otherwise for a somewhat more-than proportionate United Kingdom share in the total international effort;*U* in the latter case, the converse would apply.     We need a flexibleposition to take account of these uncertainties.il.   Kenyan ranches and plantations    It Is necessary to recognise that ifspecific provision is made for financial contributions to the proposed farmPurchase scheme, and this inoluded ranches and plantations, it might be4iffioult to resist pressure from Kenya for similar treatment.     Ihestructure of the Trust Fund  as so far envisaged is such that no direotPrecedent need be created but if the Kenyans successfully pressed thiswould post the United Kingdim Aid Programme an additional  100 million.iii.   cost of providing for Rhodesian emigrants to the United kingdom in a parallel contingency planning exercise, it has been estimated thate*penditure of up to  100 million might be incurred by HMG on costs ofresettlement in the United Kingdom if there were a major and sudden migrationQf United Kingdom-passport-holders from Rhodesia.     This also indicates a need to give ourselves room for manoeuvre   downwards, in what we are preparedto contribute, especially if the worst case were to eventuate.SECRET
PR6SPECT5 OF INTERNATIONAL PARTICIPATION16*   Dr Kissinger has said -that the United States might finanoe up to 50 per ceiof the costs of the plan, &quot;but no Amerioan Secretary of State, least of all oneobviously in his last few months of office, can commit Congress to authorise and appropriate sumB of this order.     Congress has persistently frustrated the foreiaid proposals of successive United States Administrations for over ten years, auiit is questionable whether it would sympathise with the idea of (as Congress mie-see it) devoting large sums to the baling-out of a European Rhodesian populationwhose plight is the consequence of its own political myopia.    Neither has Rhodeever been a ooncem of the French or the Germans;   the Germans have lately beenseeking to curb their foreign aid commitments for budgetary reasons.    A Southcontribution is conceivable in respect of those Europeans who leave Rhodesia to .in the Republic, but if their numbers were large, the South Africans would prob &apos;seek to limit their total obligation.     It would therefore be prudent for Minis&quot;!to consider the financial implications of the Rogers proposals against the possithat unless they placed now a specific limit on the united Kingdom contribition,the whole, or at least a substantial proportion of the oosts, qn the beat andassumptions, could fall on the Oil ted Kingdom.Conditions Precedent to International Participation17.   Apart from the uncertainty of contributions at all from others there is ale^a problem concerning commitments for longer periods ahead which would be impliedunderwriting the payments to white settlers for pensions, housing and farms,    A*estimate of the potential size of the commitment can be built up in total on befl*worst assumptions, and that approach has been adopted in this paper.    But therate of expenditure would be uncontrollable.    Its incidence oan be guessed atpayments in excess had to be made the &quot;Adjustment Fund&quot; Would have to meet them,if any commitment is confined to 5 years as in the latest version of the Rogersproposals each country will necessarily think in terms of annual disbursementswill wish to put a limit on each of them.     The only conceivable approach fromdonors&apos; point of view is to agree to allocate a fixed sum over a finite period ofyears (say five in the American case it may be only one.) subject to a review at end of that period.     The approach might be to make the fund available to theZimbabwe Government on condition and to the extent that it accepted its responsitowards the white settlers.8
CHARGES ON THE AID PROGRAMME18,   Any relief to the Rhodesian economy afforded by the assumption by Britain ofSkodesien obligations should count as &quot;aid&quot; internationally.     It might therefore* argued that the whole of the United Kingdom contribution to the proposed packageoould be regarded aB aid.     There are some precedents for payments from aid funds to pensioners of governments who have deliberately repudiated their obligations;   andthe cost of land transfer, both in Rhodesia and Kenya, would clearly, on precedent,a proper charge to the Aid programme, as would development aid for agricultureeducation.    OM see difficulty about classifying the finanoing of the purchase** houses as &quot;aid&quot;;   but the proposals for an International Trust Fund would make** difficult to isolate our contribution for houBe purchase from the rest of the package,     In the Treasury*s view, the whole of the United kingdom&quot; commitment to&quot;ke scheme should count against the Aid Programme;   it would be impracticable to^Ut financial responsibility for the package between Departments;   but in any^e, if additional expenditure outside the Aid programme were proposed, this could** Present circmstances only be found at the expense of savings in other expenditure programmes.   The OIM believe however that, if it proved impossible to put a firmlimit on our contribution as propocod below, it would be necessary for new fundsbe provided, whether within -the Aid Programme or outside it.   Although this***ue floes not have to be settled immediately it will bo nocessaiy for purposesof Planning public expenditure to decide it as soon oo any firm commitment is^oepted to contribute to the plan0
C0BCLUSI01IS AND RECBDATIOHS19* It is expected that further discussions will he held in Washington in the t;lweek beginning 27 September between officials of the United States, United Kingdcffland South African governments. We recommend that Ministers agree that officials:?!should pursue discussions, without commitment for United Kingdom Ministers at thiljjstage, with the liiited states and South African officials with the objeot of limit following point clear -i. the financial consequences of Dr Kissinger*s diplomatic activity cannot&apos;;fall wholly on the United Kingdom;ii. we must ensure that the schemes are designed to avoid incentives toward?!irresponsible action by a black majority government;iii. we must make it dear to the Americans that we regard their proposals as imacceptable, since none of the potential contributors, including oursettoould accept an obligation to underwrite whatever costB might turn out to bfljinvolved in the implementation of speoific schemes - all the more so giventhese costs could vary enormously according in particular to the way in whitblack majority government behaved;iv. apart from conventional development aid the United Kingdom might beto contribute for a period of 5 years in the first instance to the proposed international Fund up to 15 oer oent of the total of actual contributionssubject to a celling of  15 million a year, on the understanding that the americans substantiated their offer to contribute up to 50 per centfrv. this contribution to the Fund and any aid for economic development, wo*be conditional upon the Zimbabwe Governmenfs acceptance of responsibilityexternal debt.10
Itt connection with iv. above, officials should explore with the Americans thePossibility that, on our own calculations, the contributions (which are predicatedon 1fce worst case) may produce more than would be required if the ZimbabweGovernment were to act responsibly.   United Kingdom offioials should ask the americans whether they envisaged that contributions would be drawn only as and*kan required to meet actual disbursements under the schemes and, if so,how the Fund would be used as leverage on the Zimbabwe Government to actresponsibly.21 September 1976
