UMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(76) 106COPY NO   8115 November 1976CABINETCIVIL SERVICE DISPERSALMemorandum by the Minister for Overseas development .        While it goes well beyond my Departments concern to argue againstthe entire dispersal programme, I do see much force in the suggestion thatwe cannot afford it at present.    It may be that some parts of the programme should stand on their merits, but I suggest that we should re-examine eachplanned dispersal to make sure mat it can be justified in terms of presentexpenditure constraints.    Like the Secretary of State for Defence, I wish to urge strongly that my own case Bhould be re-examined, on the grounds thatdispersing 1, 000 out of a total of only 2, 350 posts in the Ministry of overseas development (ODM) cannot be cost-effective and will cause excessiveoperational problems.2, On the first point, I understand that the difference between rents inLondon and elsewhere in the country has roughly halved since 1971,  whenthe Hardman Report said that this differential was &quot;the dominant feature onthe net benefit of dispersal&quot;,3.        As to the latter point, I have never been happy about the decision inrelation to ODM.    Nor was my predecessor (who unfortunately was unableto attend Cabinet when the proposal was discussed).    Hardman himself hadstrong reservations.    He made it clear that only specified blocks of work inmy small Headquarters could b* dispersed witheut an unacceptable loss of efficiency but &quot;with serious misgiving&apos;&quot; he rocoramsnded tho dispersal of650 Headquarterb putts, together with th* Directorate of Overseas Surveys(DOS), which was expected to provide: the remaining 350 posts.    H* recognisedthat a severe strain would be placed on ODM by thin move, and said th*t thiowas &quot;an instance hi which Ministers v/ill want to consider very seriouely thebalance between claims of regional policy and of efficiency&quot;.4.        The loss of efficiency will in my view be out of all proportion to thevery limited gain to Scotland, which will receive at the most 1, 000 posts.However, because of changes in work patterns I expect the Headquartersfigure to reduce to under 600; while, as explained below, the DOS is likelyto run down steadily from the 1980s, and to cease to exist altogether by theend of the century.    Obviously not all of the posts that are to move would beavailable to be filled from within Scotland; I would expect at least the keypostB to be manned by people dispersed from London with their work.1
ODM HEADQUARTERS DISPERSAL5.        Dispersal would require a permanent increase in manpower, asHardman recognised.    This could not however prevent serious inefficiency.Four hundred of the Headquarters posts: due for dispersal are concerned withrecruiting and administering our technical co-operation officers who gooverseas.    At present they deal with about 60 callers a day.    Afterdispersal the recruiters would be based in the Glasgow area but would haveto spend up to half their time in London interviewing candidates in consultationwith my professional Advisers and others who would have to remain at headquarters.    There would also be difficulty in dealing with the personalproblems of the technical co-operation officers, which through the nature oftheir employment are often difficult and require face to fact contact; atpresent thiB usually happens when the officers pass through London on their way to and from their overseas posts.    The necessary contact between theseparts of Headquarters and those concerned with policy towards particulardeveloping countries would also be impeded.    While the objections to the move of the other 200 Headquarters posts are less compelling, there is bound to be a harmful effect overall if over 40 per cent of a small Headquartersis dispersed.    I believe we should end with two separate career structures,neither of them large enough or balanced enough in composition to meet theHardman requirement of providing &quot;reasonable careers to staff without an undue amount of movement&quot;.    There would also be bound to be an overallif intangible loss of operational efficiency.DIRECTORATE OF OVERSEAS SURVEYS6.        It is even more the case with DOS that the harm to the organisation would completely outweigh the benefits to Scotland.    By the nature of itstask, DOS cannot look forward to an indefinite life- during the 1980s the320 posts which would initially move to Scotland are forecast to reduce to220, and by the end of the century - so far as can be foreseen - to a smallhard core of advisory and training posts.    Some at least of the 320 postswould be filled by people moving from Tolworth; and the key class ofcartographers are recruited on a national basis anyway.    Those who wererecruited to the cartographic staff would become redundant in the 1990s after having acquired a trade for which the demand is strictly limited.7.        Against this, I fear the move could wreck DOS.    I believe that halfthe existing staff would prefer to resign rather than move to Glasgow.    Forthe highly specialised cartographers, there might be no real option.    Theyare relatively lowly paid, and many families rely on more than one wage-earner.    Married women who represent 13 per cent of the cartographic staffprobably could not move because of family commitments; married men would be deterred by fear that their wives and other members of the familywould have poor job opportunities in Scotland.    Training replacements costs 8, 000 a head and takes 3 years, after which a cartographer still needsfurther experience before becoming fully effective.    The present staff wouldhave to divert their efforts from productive work to the training effort, andthere would be a general disruption of production for 5 years or more.    Theresult could well be that overseas customers would turn elsewhere for theirmapping and that we should have to accelerate the rundown of DOS.2
8. Building costs are already taken into account in the calculations;but we should recognise that they are disproportionately high for DOS,which must have a purpose-built building, with vibration-free floors insome areas and full air-conditioning.    It has been estimated that 40 yearsoccupancy would be needed tomake such a building an economic proposition;we expect less than 20 by DOS, and thereafter the building would not beeconomic for more conventional government use.    Further, these heavy additional costs would adversely affect the DOS&apos;s competitiveness.9.        On top of all this, the operational efficiency of DOS would be seriously reduced by putting it at Such a distance from its main workingcontacts, which are with the ODM&apos;s Scientific Units, the Ordnance survey and with air survey firms and the like, all in the south of England.CONCLUSION10.       While I recognise the weight of the policy considerations which ledto tho decision in favour of the dispersal programme, I feel it would be right in present circumstances to look again at cases which could not becost-effective in the short-term, or possibly at all.    Specifically, I would urge that we should abandon the dispersal plan for ODM.    Seriousinefficiency would result from the dispersal of over 40 per cent of myHeadquarters staff.    The consequences of moving DOS to the Glasgow area would be even worse.REPMinistry of Overseas Development15 November 19763confidential
