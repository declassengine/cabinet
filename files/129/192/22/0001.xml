5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER. BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTclCP(76) 97 COPY NO1 November 1976CABINETRECOVERY OF ROAD ACCIDENT TREATMENT COSTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Service a1, On 22 July the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announcing the public expenditure cuts, said that reductions of  70 million would be made in1977-78 in the health and personal social service programmes as a wholebut there would be no cuts in services for patients in the National health service (NHS),   Among the measures announced, he said:-,. it is proposed to save a further  20 million in 1977-78( 40 million in a full year) by legislation to recoup mainly frominsurance companies the full coot to the NHS of treating roadaccident cases&quot; (Hansard 22 July col 2016).This proposal was discussed in Cabinet on 19 July.    A detailed scheme was subsequently agreed in Home Affairs Committee without discussion.    Myofficials and I have had discussion with the motor insurers and the motoringorganisations.   A Bill is being drafted for introduction early in the Session.The commitment to recoup the NHS in this way through insurers cancertainly be met.2.        There have however been three developments which lead me to feelthat we ought to consider whether we could avoid the need for thiB Bill andinstead use the existing machinery of the Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) forthe purpose.3.        Firstly the legislative programme next Session is much tighter than we expected some months ago.    The Bill will have to be passed early in the session so that collection can begin in time.    It will be contentious both inprinciple and in detail since to keep the scheme administratively simple andtherefore not too dear it will involve rough justice and considerableanomalies between one motorist and another.    It would help the programmeif it could be dropped; this might make room for something more popular.1
4,        Secondly the public expenditure position has become graver since junly.    I think we should consider the alternative of collecting an amountequivalent to the relevant NHS treatment costs with the VED but as a distinct element which would be accounted for separately and adjustedperiodically as these costs changed.    If as I assume this could be done by making provision in the 1977 Finance Bill not only would difficult legislationbetween now and Easter be avoided but it might be possible to collect a full year&apos;s money in 1977-78 ( 40 million), rather than half a year&apos;s as has been planned at present.    The additional  20 million would benefit the generalrevenue situation.5.        Thirdly there is a new situation regarding the presentation of thescheme to recover road accident treatment costs.    At the most recentPublic Expenditure Survey Committee discussions it has been decided(against my wish) that the NHS cannot benefit by using income from this source to cover additional expenditure in the years following 1977-78.   For1978-79 and later years the level of NHS expenditure has been determinedwithout regard to this expected income.    This means that so far as the NHSis concerned, the income, for all practical purposes, will be merged withthe general revenue from taxation.    We shall therefore not be in a positionto defend the Bill by saying that because motorists are providing separatefunds for the part of the NHS that directly concerns them there is a betterprospect of providing improved services for NHS patients generally,6.        The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s view is that either the scheme should go forward as originally proposed or that corresponding reductions in public expenditure oo the health programme in 1977-78 and subsequent years should be made.    When the Cabinet in July accepted the scheme as part ofthe public expenditure savings on the health programme they did so on thebasis that &quot;the Secretary of State was prepared to undertake, if it proved impossible to get that element in the savings, to find other savings else-where to replace it&quot;.    Failure to achieve the savings on the healthprogramme would mean an increase in the public expenditure totals of 20 million in 1977-78 and  40 million in subsequent years which would haveto be met by reductions in other programmes.    Nor can the chief secretary, Treasury, agree to the proposed addition to VED, which wouldalso require legislation, as a substitute for a public expenditure saving.Apart from the objections to hypothecation of revenue, this would unaccep-tably pre-empt a taxation option which is already available to theChancellor of the Exchequer for general revenue-raising purposes.    In anycase the Chancellor of the Exchequer is not yet in a position to decide whether any increase in VED is necessary or appropriate,conclusion.        I invite Cabinet colleagues to consider whether in view of thelegislative and financial considerations set out above it would be better to drop the proposal to collect the charge through the Insurance companies and
instead to collect it with the VED or in the light of the Chief Secretary.Treasury&apos;s comments to proceed with legislation to recoup road accldejaftcosts through the insurance companies.D EDepartment of Health and Social Security1 November 19763
