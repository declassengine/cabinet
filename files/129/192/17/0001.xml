DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTVS government 4CP(76) 92 COPY NO25 October 1976CABINETTHE HANDLING OF THE BRITISH PRESIDENCYNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs when we discussed in Cabinet on II June our objectives in the european community I was invited as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on european Questions to bring before Cabinet in due course a memorandum onthe handling of the British Presidency in the first half of next year.Accordingly x attach a note by officials which has been amended followingdiscussion in the Ministerial Committee on European Questions,    their conclusions may need reconsideration later in the light of further developments but in the meantime I endorse them and commend them to mycolleagues.A foreign and Commonwealth Office25 October 1976
THE HflMDLIJC OF THE BRITISH PHESTDEHCYisTRorocTicar1.    Cabinet asked on 11 Juno that &quot;the Ministerial Cconittee on EuropeanQuestions should work out in advance .... the positions which it would be advantageous for us to take up during our Proeidency and submit a report to cabinet in the autumn&quot; (CH(76) 9th Conclusions, Minute l).2*    There is an essential distinction between the responsibilities of the presidency to conduct Community business effectively and the nationalobjectives which we shall be pursuing next yoar - notwithstanding the factthat wo hold the Chair. The issues which will then engage the Community, andthus the tasks imposed on us by the Presidency, are matters over which wo have little control.   Nor can wq always foresoo exactly how and when they will bedealt with.   Our objectives are, of course, our own choioe and papers will becoming forward separately to Ministers on a range of European issues, for oxamplour strategy in relation to the Cannon Agricultural Policy, the situation inrespect of the Common Fisheries Policy and the looation of the Joint EuropeanTorus (JET) experiment.   This paper seeks to draw together across the field the issues which will be important during our Presidency and to set out some broadconclusions on priorities and handling.3*    The Ccnnunity has boon in the doldrumB.   Chiefly this reflects the impact of the reoession on the rapid growth of the Community&apos;s early years, butalso the fact that the high hopes of European Union - and of progress towardsEMU - of the early 70*s turned out to be unrealistic.   A contributingfactor has been the difficulty the Oomounity has had in digesting its recentenlargement, particularly the British renegotiation and the continuingprooess of accommodating the United Kingdom.4*    With the agreement at the European Council of July of this year on direct elections - and with several other matters agreed - eg the follow upto the Dublin Declaration on Haw Zealand and the Luxembourg compromisepackage on technical barriers to trade, the atmosphere has begun to improve.1
But &quot;the smaller countries in particular tend to be pessimistic about the Blowprogress that is being made towards European Union and will undoubtedly be disappointed by what looks like being a meagre outcome of the TindenansReport; they tend to be sympathetic to the policies of the larger Member states in proportion to the degree of &quot;Europeanism&quot; they see in them.  And amongthe major countries we are not alone  With problems.   The Italian Oovernmonfeposition is shaky.   President Gisoard will bo increasingly looking over hisshoulder to the elections of 1978* The Germane, while sharing the oonoorn of thesmaller members for real and substantial progress towards European integrationhave domestic politioal priorities which moke avoidanoe of increased expenditurecommitments more immediately important to them than furtherance ofEuropean projeots.    The recent eleotions  ay have reduced Berr Schmidt&apos;room for manoeuvres  Furthermore-, four of the Member States - the United Kingdom,Pronoe, Italy and Ireland ore in eoonomio difficulties and this is bound to meanboth additional caution by the Community as a whole in Its trade relations withthird countries and the risk of measures being adopted by the weaker economieswhioh could be seriously damaging to the basic concept of the Customs Union.THE B&amp;TUgE OF Tig! PRESIIEHCY5*    Experience since we joined of the Presidencies of other Member states(we shall be the last of the newoomers to hold the Presidency) illustrates somelimitations we shall face in our own Presidency.   Holding the Presidency will notnecessarily help us to seoure some of our major aims like reform of the CPP andthe CAP,   Indeed, the Presidency will be a complicating factor because of our need to put forward compromises from the Chair, the traditional expectation thatthe country holding the Presidency should fulfil this duty with impartiality andeffioienoy and the exaggerated expectations in the United Kingdom about theimmediate additional influence we might be expected to exert during our Presidency.The proclaiming of high flown themes coupled with the implied expectation that inany six months the history of Europe will be dramatically changed has in the postproved oounter productive.6.    Two further difficulties arise from the position of the United kingdom.    Like the Frenoh, but unlike the rest of the original Six, wo do notnecessarily start from the premise that existing or new Community polio iceare likely to be preferable to purely national policies.  We often find ourselves resisting extensions of Community competence! though where there is general agreement to work for new corn on polioies (energy and scientific polio;our voice is no loss strong than that of the others. In addition tho Conn unity of Six reached compromises (for example on agriculture and fisheries)2
which we are hound to seek to modify; where we are positivelyseeking changes in the statue quo it is relatively easy forthem to prevent or delay.   We may thus find ourselves in a small minority or even isolated on certain issues.    Our Presidency assuch will not then help us.b.   There could he some degree of interaction between our main objectives and a range of other issues such as direct elections,summer time and passports; the extent to which we show readiness to rally to the majority view on such issues could affect ourprogress elsewhere.OPPORTUNITIES7.   But if the Presidency has limitations for us which it will be important to recognise - and which make it essential not to arouseexaggerated expectations - it will also give us opportunities.   Muchwill be expected of us.   And we should not forget that some smallerMember States e.g. the Irish have managed to distinguish themselvesduring their presidency.   With our greater experience and resourcesWe shall be expected to do better.   In particular we might concentrate on four opportunities which the Presidency provides -a. To give an impetus towards a more pragmatic, more efficient and less bureaucratic Community.   This is in many ways what our european partners have been seeking from us*   And the review of theCommission and the Council Secretariat should also start in ourPresidency.b. To put over to the people of this country what the community is all about while not indulging in a campaign of pro-Communitypublicity which would not be well received.   This will be the first time that major meetings of the Nine have been held here.   Weshould try to avoid an impression of dullness in the proceedings.c. To try for at any rate one achievement from the Chair whichshould not necessarily be a major initiative (e.g. the modest butuseful proposals we have in mind for the removal of technicalbarriers to. trade in motor vehicles within the Community) but which would be in our interest and would also reflect credit on us.d. To appropriate as much as possible the adjective &quot;Communautairel,If should always be easier for the Presidency than for ordinarymembers to do this.3

The tasks of the Presidency are not confined to matters within the Treaty.One of the  most onerous ia European Political Co-operation.   Ministers will wish to consolidate the good reputation already gained by the United kingdom in this area.   In the abBenoe of a central secretariat, not only the running of Political Co-operation, but also the initiative, devolve largely on the presidency.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be expected to give a lead inusing Politioal Co-operation to the full as opportunity offers.   This is an area in which it is relatively easy to show up the unco-operative attitude ofthe French and to earn marks for Britain as a loading contributor to a goodCommunity profile in the world at large.   Too much zeal could be counter-productive, but a readiness to expand and deepen   Community politioal co-operation will be weloomod by most Members, particularly the smaller ones.   Itis important to show careful respect for the dividing line between Conmunitybusiness and political co-operation and to avoid encroaching on areas of community competence.4THE ISSUES8. This general approach is reflected in the following survey of individualtopics.   The main headings are -
Enlargement10.   Negotiations with Greece on membership which we as the Presidencywill have to conduct both at ministerial and official level (in consul-tat ion naturally with other Member States) will have started; the first half of 1977 will be an active and important stage although thenegotiations may well not be concluded until 1978.   It is likely thatPortugal will apply for membership either before or early in ourPresidency hut the first stage will be the preparation by the Commissionof an opinion on the application and this will probably stretch beyond our Presidency.   It is unlikely that Spain will be in a position to apply for membership before the end of our Presidency but the knowledge thatthere may be a major enlargement of the Community towards the Southduring the next few years may well influence discussion on a wide range of Community issues during that period.   There is likely during ourPresidency to be a continuation of vigorous attempts by the Italians to claim compensation for their agricultural products in relation to Greekentry and the delay caused by the wrangle (in which we shall of courseheed discreetly hut firmly to protect our interests) will suit us well.There is a contradiction both for ourselves and others between thepolitical importance of supporting Greek and Portuguese entry and theeconomic importance of avoiding too heavy an&apos; economic and financial burden in bringing about their membership;   We shall need to put the**phasis on ensuring detailed analysis of the implications of enlargementwithout leaving ourselves open to the criticism that we are seeking* pretext to delay matters.   It should be possible to use the economicconcerns of other Members to achieve this while maintaining an appearance of impartial efficiency in the chair.grade negotiationsH.   Several separate areas will be importanta. Japan.   Ministers will be considering shortly a memorandum bythe Secretary of State for Trade on how the Prime Minister might bestraise at the European Council (29-30 November) the question of amore balanced development of trade with Japan.   The CBI and the TUChave jointly expressed interest in such an initiative, and thematter will no doubt he followed up during our Presidency.b. Mediterranean.   Unless agreement has been reached by the end ofthis year discussion will be required on the mandate for the resumption of negotiations between the Community and Spain for a trade agreement to replace that signed by the Community of Six in1970.   It will he important for us to get the preferentialaooess to the rich and growing Spanish5
market (United Kingdom exports to Spain in 1975    295 million)enjoyed by the Six but some complex issues will be involved and thetask will not be easy.   In addition there will be some negotiations withIsrael on a financial protocol to the agreement whioh the Communitymovement of labour.   And agreements ore likely to be signed during ourPresidency with Egypt, Jordan and Syria - the Hashrao; states - thenegotiations with Lebanon being in temporary abeyance.c. Iron.   It still regains possible that negotiations for an economic co-operation agreemont will be bedevilled by the desire of some of ourCommunity partners to attempt to ingratiate themselves with the Iranians byarguing for a preferential agreement which however would undermine tho GAT?MFff principle.d. The Euro Arab dialogue  will face the Community with continuingpressure for concessions and the possibility that we might needreluctantly to agree to a Ministerial level meeting of the GeneralCommission in London in April-Nay 1977*e. Bastera Europe.   It might fall to us to hand over the final form of theConounity*B response to the CMEATs approach for an agreement but it will be important first to roach a settlement with other Member States on the formof the counter draft which we prefer.   There may be a problem of timing inrelation to the run-up to the CSCE Review Conference in Belgrade next year,but this is not likely to be of major importance.^&quot;    Yugoslavia.   Our tenure of the Presidency should help us to keep uppressure on the other meinbor states on the political nocossity of improvingYugoslavia*B relations with the e.c..   But the scope for economic concessionsby the United Kingdom is small.   This will limit our ability to press home any initiative whioh would to depend on concessions by other member Btates.g.    Multilateral negotiations.   During our Presidency tho multilateral trade negotiations, becalmed for some time because of tho AmericanPresidential Election will nood to rosumei if they are to bo concluded bythe end of 1977 as ogrood at Rambouillot we may be involved in fixingdeadlines in the GATT and the beginnings of a major   olash betweenthe United States and the Community on access for  Unitod Statesagricultural produots may become apparent.     He shall also be involvedin the revision of the GATT Multifibre Arrangement where wc  have important interests   at stake   both   in relation to our own   textilealready has with them which might lead to some political difficulties ifthe Israeli*s press for signature in Jerusalem.   There will be somedifficult discussions under the Association Agreement with Turkey onwhich we (and the Gormans) will need to take a oautious line on the free6.
industry and our relations with the developing countries.   And itwill also fall to us to smooth the way to continuation and formalisation of the existing international consensus on terms and interest rates in the export credits fi&amp;d (&quot;Tne Gentlemen&apos;s agreement&quot;).Relations with Developing Countries12.   During our Presidency we shall have the responsibility for organ-ieing the co-ordination of a Community line in negotiations with the developing countries in the UNCXAD framework, on commodities and,particularly, starting in march, on the Common Funds.   There remains apossibility that CISC will not end in December and that the UnitedKingdom will have the responsibility of leading the e.c. Delegation atthe final session.   We shall also need to pursue agreement on Communityaid to the Ron-Associates and to take an active part, as President inthe operation of the Lome agreement (including an ACP-e.c. Joint Councilof ministers) especially as it affects such matters as access forBotswana beef and the arrangements for ACP sugar.   And the fact that theCommonwealth Conference in June 1977 will coincide with our presidency of the e.c. (and Mr Jenkins&apos; Presidency of the Commission) will probablymean that some time will be devoted in the Commonwealth Conference torelations with the Community.Agriculture and Fisheries13.   Separate papers will be reaching Cabinet on our strategy inrelation to the Common Agricultural Policy and the approach to pricefixing for 1977.   The first three months of our Presidency will bedominated by the negotiations leading up to the farm price fixingpackage which may also be expected to cover related agricultural issuessuch as green currencies and the problems of existing regimes, inParticular milk.   Also in the course of our Presidency the Council mayhe dealing with proposals for new regimes and structural measures.Depending on the outcome of current discussions at official level withthe Commission we may also need to defend in the Council the essentialfunctions of our marketing boards.   We should also have to safeguard our animal health standards and we intend to make use of the presidency to promote a more sensible7
approach to food harmonisation rules.   While our Presidency will give us procedural opportunities to further our interests it will be regardedas our duty to promote compromise in an area of conflict between theUnited Kingdom and the majority.   In the fisheries sector a majoreffort will be needed to carry through the vital work on the threeinterlocking questions of the extension of fishery limits, the revisionof the common fisheries policy and the negotiation of agreements withthird countries, together with improvements in market support arrangements for fish.Economic Monetary and Fiscal Matters14.   Unemployment and the effects of recession are among the mostimportant problems facing the Community.   We took an initiative onunemployment earlier this year and it will be an important subject ofdiscussion in the Finance Council and elsewhere.   Relevant to this willbe the probable holding during our Presidency of a Tripartite conference between Governments, employers and trade unions of the Member States andthere will be pressures to develop the relationship between the socialpartners and the Community Constitutions.   The TUC may well see the presidency as an opportunity for extending their influence in Brussels.We shall also need to devote a good deal of attention to continuingamong Finance Ministers informal discussions of how improved co-ordination of economic policies can promote recovery and reduce unemployment.   For the rest we may be left with the final stages of theconeertation procedure with the Assembly on the 1977 Budget.   Work willcontinue on the revision of the Financial Regulation and the use of theEuropean Unit of Account for budgetary purposes.   Progress during theDutch Presidency on a revised version of the Sixth Directive on VATwill determine whether the target date of 1 January 1978 for fullimplementation of the Community*s agreed system of &quot;own resources&quot; in1978 is still realistic.   And we shall have to consider whether theJoint Foreign/Finance Council in March should be used as an attempt toprovide an orientation for the 1978 budget; our attempt to do so thisyear for the 1977 Budget was not successful.Institutional and related matters15.   The Tindemans ReportIf agreement is not reached this year on the Tindemans Report the BritishPresidency will have to continue the discussions:   The nature of these will depend on what happens between now and then, but they will obviouslynot be easy.   If agreement has been reached before the end of the year it will fall to the British Presidency to begin to implement whatevernew procedures may be agreed,8
for example 1d take part in Assembly debates on the state of the Union(assuming that these are instituted), to co-ordinate the activities ofthe specialist Councils, and to develop procedure   to enable ministers to ooneider together both the Community and political co-operationaspects of a given problem and to ensure the complete implementation ofsuoh decisions.In any case there are likely to be points on which the agreed positions of the Nine on certain Tindemans proposals are ambiguous or at leastopen to interpretation; and as President we may be required to take aline on this.   Possible examples are any formulae concerning decisiontaking procedures and the delegation of executive functions.   (It isdifficult to foresee what suoh points might he until the Tindemansdiscussions have got further, and in particular we have covered theproposals on institutions.)16.   In addition we shall almost certainly have to preside overMinisterial discussions on the questions of a uniform passport and theharmonisation of summertime periods on both of which our nationalpositions are at variance with those of most other Member States.   Thereflay also be some discussion of fundamental human rights, and followingour initiative last year there is likely to he further discussion ofco-operation on questions of law and order at a meeting of Ministers ofthe Inferior.   It is likely that some items of business ancillary to theagreement on dirsot elections to the Assembly will   come to the Councilduring our Presidency.   The extent to which progress is made with legislation in the United Kingdom will be regarded as a measure of good faith in accepting 1978 on a best endeavours basis as the target date for the elections.   There is a chance that the Assembly will presentthe Council under our Presidency with the sensitive problem of the siting of the Assembly on which we have so far been able to avoid takingsides.17.   Progress on the development of a common energy policy has hitherto been disappointing.   We have supported the Commissions so farunsuccessful attempts to secure the adoption of a balanced package of measures as an initial step, and pressed our case hard at the EnergyCouncil on 19 October.   We set much store by securing agreement to asuitable e.c. scheme for a minimum safeguard price for oil (MSP) and toachieving, if possible, some Community support for developing our resources, particularly coal.   The French however remain opposed; weOust make great efforts to shift them.   If we succeed then there maybe considerable opportunities for the United Kingdom to promote further9
initiatives during the Presidency in this sector.   We aim to hold anumber of meetings of Energy Ministers and work will need to be done to provide substance for them to discuss.Social and Regional Policy18.   The Regional Development Fund and the Social Fund will need renewalor review before the end of 1977 and discussion of possible successorarrangements will be going on during our  Presidency.   We are at presetmodest net beneficiaries.   In dealing with the funds during the presidency it will be wise to bear in mind that the addition of greece and the possibility of other new members in due course would requireentirely new arrangements if Britain were to have much prospect of con-tinning to be a net beneficiary.   It is impossible to say whether anysuch arrangements could be negotiated.   But in so far as we are seelcingin these funds a transfer of resources from the richer members of theCommunity the issue is linked with the possibility set out in 0(76)36(a note by officials on British objectives in the European Community -considered by Cabinet on 11 June 1976 - CM(76)9th Conclusions, Minute l)and marked for consideration after the German elections - of a moreambitious approach to the transfer of resources within the Community inthe interests of improving the industrial performance of those member states with below average growth and GDP per head.   Work will continue on the Social Action programme which includes some proposals e.g. onillegal immigration and the education of migrant workers&apos; children that could present difficulties.Science and Technology, JBT and JRC19.   Ministers earlier agreed that we should attempt to have the JET(Joint European Torus) the largest single experiment in the Community18research programme for the production of energy by fusion, sijed atCulham, Oxfordshire.   The issues are complex.   The   Italians would li**JET at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) at Ispra and there are other possible sites at Garohing in Germany and Cadarache in France.   Thereare also financial complications.   The issues may be settled in 1976but could still remain for settlement at the outset of our Presidency.10CONFIDENTIAL
Industrial Policy20*   There is no oohesive e.c. industrial policy to sot alongside the CAP and the Common Commercial Policy, partly because of differences of approach amongthe Member States, partly because of unrealistic   polioies put forward hithertoby the Commission and partly because of tho variety of separate seotorsoovcred by industrial policy.   But in the important field of the removal ofteohnioal barriers to trade   (complementing the now visually completeremoval within&apos; the Community of tariffs)   we aim to provide a paokage of regulations under a &quot;Framework&quot; Direotive whioh would provide Communityprooedures for the mutual raoognition on the basis of a definitive list of standards and other requirements of national vehicle type approvals granted by Member States.   This would oeen that vehicle manufacturers would be ableto trade freely throughout the Community in vahiole models whioh had beentested and approved by any one Member State - thus saving- noney and cuttingoostB.   This initiative would be warmly welcomed by our own motor industry,Ond in the Community generally and if successful would mean the firstinternational agreement of its kind.   He shall also want to see progress ona number of other proposals of interest to British industry, covering such products as tractor driver seats, electronic devices and dangerous substances.BlBewhero in the industrial policy field two oompany law direotivos (one oncompany capital and the other on accounts) are in an advanced state of consideration.   He are ensuring that the draft direotive on public purchasingof. supplies (providing for common prooedures to be introduced in Member states for the advertising and award of public supplies contracts abovo a oertainthreshold value) meets the requirements Ministers laid down in May ( 1(76)(21(76) 4th Meeting).   Wo should like to secure progress towards the adoptionof directives on Life assuranoe and co-insuranoo which are currently underconsideration.   And there may be some discussion of shipbuilding in theCommunity in the context of world wide overcapacity.   But much will dependon the ability of the new Commissioner for Industrial Affairs who will beappointed from 1 January 1977.11
Transport Policy21.   Despite the welcome whioh our initiative en the vehicle package can he expectedto receive, we are likely to be in difficulty over the draft of a Social Regulationaffecting drivers eenditions and the like, even though it is intended to help over-cosio seae of the objections which have led us to seek derogations from the existingrules.   A renewal of those derogations will be indispensable in February and we mayhave an awkward time then, with repercussions on our other objectives.   We are alsoin broach of the related regulation on the tachograph (regarded on the Continentas the drivers&apos; protection against exploitation, but hero nicknamed &quot;the spy inthe Cab&quot;) and ve shall have to continue to exercise persuasion to arrest the initiation of legal proceedings against vs.Bavironmsatal Policy22.   The Presidency offers us a ehaneo to do something to improve our generally poorreputation la the Cossmalty in the field of environmental policy.   There is areasonable prospect that this could bo achieved by giving impetus to a number of measures in the Environmental PrograsMQ to which United Kingdom Ministers havealready accorded their support but it would not be realistic given the differences in national policies to expect rapid progress.   There will still remain problems overdraft directives on titanium -dioxide and palp industry wastes which are not to ourliking.COMCUJSIOMS25-   a.   Our main national objectives during the Presidency should bo to secure changesin the Common Fisheries Policy (aad adequate fishing arrangements with third countries), a CAP price fixing which discourages expensive surpluses, a determinedapproach to the problem of unemployment and the effects of recession in theCommunity, the development of more balanced trading relationships with Japan and(subjeot to Hialsterlal discussion - and if the matter is still outstanding) the location of JIT in the United Kingdom.b.   It will help to secure these objectives and advance our influence and there-fore eur interests in the Community if we -i. make the maximum impact from efficient and helpful chairmanship on thevarious Ministerial and Official Committees, making as much use as possible of a &quot;Community&apos;&apos; attitude.ii. show ourselves forthcoming and imaginative where we can be(eg Political Co-operation generally, the &quot;whole vehicle&quot; package of12
directives to free trade in reticles) including those itaas, directalaetiens, uniferB passports, and stumer tiae vherw eur partners arcleaking far pregeas.25 October 197613
