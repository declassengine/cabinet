1*)CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 86 &quot; g copy NO18 October 1976CABINETRATE SUPPORT GRANT 1977-78Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment.        Local authorities pay for their current expenditure from charges,from rates and from central Government grant.    The bulk of this grant isHate Support Grant (RSG).    Each year the Government has to decide whatsupport it wishes to give by way of RSG towards estimated local authoritycurrent expenditure.    The level of this support is expressed as a percentageof that expenditure.  In 1976-77 the percentage was 65  per cent - 6* 852 million on an expenditure of  10,461 million.    We must now make adecision on the percentage for 1977-78,2.        Because RSG finances such a high proportion of local authoritycurrent expenditure our decision on its level haB a key influence on tworelated matters of great political and economic importance, ie:-a, the level of expenditure which authorities actually undertakein the grant year;b. the level of rates they set for mat year.A lower rate of grant should act to restrain expenditure but will result in ahigher level of rates; a higher rate of grant will enable there to be lower level of rates while mitigating the restraining influence on expenditure.    Butboth these influences are very general.   Any estimate of the average of therate call and increase in rates will be the average of a wide range.3.        We discussed the proper level of grant at a meeting on 12 October.We agreed at that meeting that our objective should be to find a rate of grant which would be optimal in terms of restraining expenditure by localauthorities and maintaining their co-operation.    We also agreed that a rateof grant so low as to impose rate increases so high as to appear to authorities unfair and punitive would be counter-productive.    We would lose their co-operation which was essential for restraining expenditure.4.        The difference between us was what was the right rate which did not*isk losing their co-operation.    We agreed this was a political judgment.I consider it to be 62 per cent; the Chief Secretary thought it should be60 per cent; the Secretary of State for Scotland 63 per cent.1
5.        The case for a grant of 62 per cent has to be seen in the context of thetask local authorities are being set for next year.    This is a reduction incurrent expenditure of between l  per cent and 2 per cent.6*        Such a reduction may seem a small figure but it is one authorities will find very difficult to achieve.    They face very strong pressures to spend.    In the past, when expenditure has been growing they have consistently spent over the RSG expenditure base; in 1976-77 - when thereshould have been a standstill - on latest estimates they will spend anadditional  250 million (plus  50 million on housing at November 1975 prices.K they overspent when the target totals were growing or constant, then the pressures to overspend when the target total is reduced will be even greater.The authorities will fear - with a good deal of justice - redundancies and adecline in the standards of services.    They will be pressed to raise ratesas high as they dare in order to keep their expenditure up.7*        The justification for the figure of 62 per cent is that, broadly speaking,it is the figure that falls out from the threats about grant that we have madein the course of the last year.    It would therefore be accepted as beingreasonable and fair by authorities and they would, I judge, be co-operativein helping us attain our expenditure figures.    It would also enable us to saythat if they follow the Governmenfs expenditure plans they should be able to restrain rate increases to the level of inflation - say 10 per cent.8.        But in practice rate increases will almost certainly turn out to be higher than this.    They could approach 20 per cent, which means, becauseof the wide variation around the average, some authorities experiencingincreases up to 60 per cent.    This is based on three assumptions all ofwhich I think likely to come about:-i.       local authorities assume a rate of inflation slightly higher than that forecast by Government;ii.       they draw less from balances;iii.       they keep their expenditure in 1977-78 to the level reached in 1976-77, ie l\ per cent to 2 per cent more than provided for inthe Government&apos;s plane.The settlement will therefore be a tough one.9*       A lower grant percentage would increase the size of rate rises even further.   But in my judgment this would run the risk that we would loseco-operation and that expenditure would be more likely to increase thanreduce.   Moreover the high rate increases would be particularlyconcentrated in those authorities who are heavily dependent on resourcesclement (generally speaking the poorer areas) where in many cases theywill fall on council tenants who will also be facing increases in rents.    Theywill see the rent and rate increase as one additional payment (of certainlywell over  la week) falling on them as a result of the Governmenfs policies.2
10.       I do not pretend this would be an ideal settlement.    It will be verydifficult to present such a settlement and frame any advice we may give to authorities.    I shall be having further discussions about this.    Neverthelessgiven the constraints of the present system it is the best we can do.    I ask my colleagues therefore to agree to a grant percentage of 62 per cent.PSDepartment of the Environment18 October 19763
