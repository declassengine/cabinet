*S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 77 COPY NO     r j20 September 1976CABINETUNEMPLOYMENT AMONG YOUNG PEOPLEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster GeneralBACKGROUND1, The Cabinet asked for specific proposals to be brought forward forthe most sensible and cost-effective measure or combination of measureswhich could be taken in face of the problem of unemployment among young people (CM(76) 22nd Conclusions),    The Ministerial Group on Unemploy-ment among Young People have considered a range of proposals which took account also of the Cabinet&apos;s decision at its 21st meeting that serious consideration should be given to a possible job-release scheme.AGREED recommendations. The Group were agreed in recommending to the Cabinet the adoptionof three measures -a. The provision of an additional  15 million for the JobCreation programme.    This is now proving increasingly successful,but without these additional funds no new projects will be able to beaccepted after the end of October.    They should create about 11,000extra jobs for 30 weeks.b. Training in office and clerical occupations, and for computerprogramming and operating.     These schemes together would cost 6.6 million and provide training for 4,400 young people for periods of nine to twelve months.    The Group were, however, anxious thatthese schemes should only go ahead provided that there was areasonable assurance that jobs would be available for the traineesafterwards, and that the bona fides of the institutions offeringtraining, especially in the field of computer programming and operating, should be satisfactory.1
c. Extension of funding for additional posts in the localauthority Careers Service.    The cost is  1.1 million for one year.In all cases the gross costs quoted would be partly offset by savings.Details of the costs of these and of all the other measures considered by theGroup are at Annex A.OTHER MEASURES CONSIDERED3.        The Group recognised that it was not within its competence to makefirm recommendations aa to the total amount which should be devoted to measures of this sort, and therefore endeavoured to rank in order ofpreference other measures which were supported by some but not all members of the Group.    Two minister a were opposed to all the other measures considered.    They took the view that within the limits of public expenditure further measures to reduce unemployment could only divertresources from other Government policies which would secure more lastingbenefits than the short-term actions under consideration.    The chief secretary, Treasury, reserved his position on all other measures.     Themajority of the Group would favour the introduction of a job release schemeand of educational maintenance allowances if the Cabinet consider thatthere should be a larger package.    Some members attached a high priority to the adoption of at least one of these.    If only one of these two were tobe introduced, the majority of the Group considered that the job releasescheme should be preferred.    In the light of views expressed by the confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress the Groupnow consider that if the job release scheme is adopted the unemployedshould be eligible,4.        The educational maintenance scheme would not affect youthemployment until April 1977 but 1b estimated to lead to 21, 000 extra young people staying on in education in 1977-78 at a gross cost of  18 million.The numbers would rise by 1979-80 to 44,000 at a gross cost of 24- 35 million.    The job release scheme, assuming that it runs from1 January 1977 to 30 June 1977 and that the unemployed were eligible but thatit was confined to the assisted areas is estimated to remove 65,000 fromthe unemployment register, on average for a little under a year, at a grosscost of  73 million.    It would require 185 staff until June 1977 and 100 for afurther year.5.        Three important qualifications were, however, placed on themajority endorsement of these two further measures -a.        The Chief Whip, House of Lords, warned that the amendment to the Education Bill now before the Lords which would be necessaryto implement the educational maintenance scheme would cause some risk that the whole BUI, and possibly even other government measures, might be lost.2
b. &apos;i&apos;hc Minister for Housing and Construction entered a strongreservation that if the educational maintenance scheme were to beadopted it should be 100 per cent financed by central Government inview of the extreme pressure being exerted on local authorities toreduce their expenditure.c. The Secretary of State for Scotland entered a strongreservation that the extension of the Temporary Employment Subsidy,which will at present be closed to new applications after the end ofthis year, should be given priority over the job release scheme.6.        Attached at Annexes Bt C and D are detailed notes by officials on the educational maintenance scheme, the job release scheme and the extensionof the Temporary Employment Subsidy.conclusion.        The Group were unanimous in recommending to the Cabinet the threemeasures set out in paragraph 2.    If further measures were to beintroduced the majority of the Group supported the job release scheme and educational maintenance allowances in that order or priority.    The chief secretary, Treasury, however, reserved his position on both these measures.S w department of Education and Science20 September 19763

IMRDENhmlANNEX &amp;&apos; EDUCATIONAL MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCESThe -present scheme.   In England and Vales educational maintenance allowances payable in respect of pupils, and parallel grants to students, &quot;betweencompulsory school age and 19 to enable them to stay on at school or to take equivalent level courses in further education are entirely within the discretion of local education authorities,and the uneven exercise of this discretion has been much criticised^7 Parliament (eg the 1974 Expenditure Committee Report), the TUGand others.   This contrasts with a standardised system of allowances in Scotland, financed through rate support grant and payable within&quot;one discretion of local authorities, hut at rates, and scales fixedcentrally.iLrevised schemeEducation2-   The/Departments consider that there is a strong case for introducing in England and Wales a better structured system of:-cans-tested allowances to encourage reasonably well-motivatedPupils, who otherwise would have left school, to continue theireducation.   This would have the effect of increasing in the long&quot;term the hitherto persistently low participation in post-16 education0* young people from the more disadvantaged social classes and also of reducing significantly in the shorter term the numbers ofunemployed school leavers.   This note examines the possibilityand legislative implications of adopting a scheme on the lines of&quot;the Scottish system, and one which would obviate or minimise&quot;consequential additional expenditure by local education authorities0n course provision.CONFIDENTIAL
confidential.   The proposal differs from the existing Scottish bursary scheme in one major respect.   In Scotland a well established scheme isoperated through the normal rate support grant procedure;   it isconsidered that in England and Wales it would be necessary to launch a scheme with specific grant from central funds (at 90%) becauseof the long history of full local education authority discretion in this area and the virtual certainty that no progress would bemade in view of present financial limitations upon local authoritiesunless some grant incentive were offered.4.   The nub of the present proposal is that, although a nationallyprescribed scale of awards (and of parental income assessments)would be made by regulation, authorities would have full discretionwhether or not to make a grant, provided a place was, or could bemade, available at a school or college without additional expenditureon buildings or staff.   The intention is that consequentialeducation costs should be marginal.Numbers of pupils/students5-   It has been estimated that in the first full year of thescheme grants of varying amounts (see paragraph 6 below) woulclbe paid in respect of a total of 9^,000 pupils/students of whom21,000 (22%) would be &quot;new recruits&quot; attracted by the scheme.1Of the remainder, 18,000 would already have been in receipt of awards under the existing wholly discretionary arrangements and55*000 would be already staying on without awards.   By the thirdyear, total grants might rise to about 117,000 of which 44,000 (58%)would &quot;be in respect of additional stayers-on;   numbers in theother categories would remain constant.   It should be emphasised,however, that these figures were extrapolated from an Autumn 1974Survey based on assumptions about likely take-up.   Since thenincreasing financial pressures on parents arising out of unemploymentmay have forced some of those staying on at school without grantsupport to leave, in order to obtain work or, increasingly, to seekSupplementary Benefit.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLovftl and assessment of awards6.     As in Scotland,, individual grants in respect of school pupilswould decrease in steps of  15 from a maximum of  270 a year tonil according to parental income, which would be assessed on a scale designed, like the Scottish equivalent, to provide forthe maximum award at about the Supplementary Benefit (SB) level.For ease of operation, however, we would propose to use thefree school meals &quot;net income&quot; method of calculation with which our local education authorities are more familiar.   Equivalentawards in further education would be assessed so as to compensate for the wider range of other benefits available to school pupils.The average grant (at 19?6 Survey prices) would, as in Scotland,be  180 for school pupils and  225 for students in further education. *Cost of revised scheme7.     The total cost of the scheme (see Appendix)^ in -the first year would be  18 million of which a maximum of about  11 million would represent awards paid in respect of pupils/students alreadystaying oh in education without the benefit of grant.   Againstthe total cost should be set, however, the potential saving inSB payments.   This is difficult to determine, since it would depend on how many of the &quot;new recruits&quot; would otherwise haveclaimed SB in their own right; but it could be anything up toa maximum of  ^  million.   The numbers staying on in subsequent years could be expected to rise and are estimated to reach44,000 in the third year; the gross cost would then be. between 24 million and  35 million, depending on how the pupils were concentrated in different areas.   Against this could be offsetsavings of SB of between  2 million and  10 million depending on&apos;the employment situation.iJjnpact on unemploymente-   The Scheme would take effect from the next school leaving dateie April 1977 and could result in a significant decrease in thenumber of otherwise newly unemployed young people at that time.CONFIDENTIAL
Although the expected numbers of stayers-on given in previousparagraphs have been estimated to start at the relatively low level of 21,000 building up to 44,000 in later years, the figure for the   first year may be conservative (it was estimatedbefore the full impact of juvenile unemployment became apparent); but to retain this figure for working purposes, if only7 additional pupils elected to stay on next April at each of the5000 comprehensive schools this would achieve a 21,000 reductionin unemployment - and this takes no account.of other secondary schools or further education colleges.    If the figures were higherthan estimated, the cost in grants would, of course, be correspondinglyhigher; but the saving in SB could more than compensate for this.Questions raised9-      The following auctions have bsen raised on the scheme:-.a.     Evaluation of the proposal as a long-term measure&apos; againstthe wider background of the educational needs of 16-18year olds. tiThe rationalisation of the present EMA system would not .of itself change the types of education at present provided*for 16-18&apos;s in schools or further education.   It would however provide a clear and consistent basis of expectationfor any well-motivated child, however poor, to be able tocontinue his education and would undoubtedly result in morestayers-on.   The educational needs of the 16-18 age group are a major question now under review; see, for example,the recent Government statement on vocational preparationwhich envisages initiatives in schools as well as colleges.b.     It is directed mainly or exclusively to the more academicpupils?   Does the Scottish or Northern Ireland experiencesuggest any particualr difficulties eg unwilling pupils,disruption of classes etc?It is not directed at pupils of particular academic ability&apos;Sixth forms now include large numbers of pupils who are no*working for A level examinations.   The level of ability ofrecipients-of grant would therefore cover a wide spectrum.
CUNHUfcW 1 iALThere is no evidence that unwilling or disruptive pupilsare normally found in VI Forms, whore attendance is notcompulsory.   The levels of grant suggested are not suchas to attract less well-motivated pupils who could moveeasily be drawing SB at a significantly higher rate.Precisely what discretion will local authorities have egwhen places are available, the means -test is satisfiedand the pupil is able enough?Local education authorities would have full discretion,subject to the need to pay grant at prescribed rates (asin Scotland) to pupils enabled to stay on.   There is noreason to believe that, given a 90% grant basis, authorities would not do their best to accommodate pupils desiring placesEqually, however, there is no doubt about the powers of schools or colleges to exclude unsuitable pupils or students,and not to admit those for whom they cannot provide places.How would the scheme fit in (or overlap?) with further education courses training schemes etc and with thepractice whereby some schools second pupils to such courses?The scheme would be complementary to training courses,in the sense that it would give assistance for young people wishing to continue in general education at school or college as an alternative to specifictraining.   Vocational training courses at further education colleges not assisted under other schemes would, however, be included.   So far as the schoolsare concerned, there is some likelihood that courseswith a broadly vocational content will be developedincreasingly. j
CONFIDENTIALe.   Is there any realistic way of presenting and actuallytreating the measure as short-term?   On the method of financing,for example, could the specific grant he phased out, leaving the power to prescribe scales and methods of assessment withsupport through ESG?   &apos;There would be little realistic prospect of treating the concept of EMAs as short-term.   They have existed already for many years jand the view of the Education Departments is that rationalisationin England and Wales (on the Scottish pattern) is long overdue.There might well, however, be a term set for the provision of90% grant by the Government.   This could be regarded as apump-priming  operation   in order to get the scheme going, butonce it became part of the normal practice of authorities towork to standard scales (as it is in Scotland) there is nodoctrinal reason why it should not revert to RSG.   A period of4 to 5 years might achieve this, particularly if there were then a better financial climate in which to make the change.Whether the scheme were financed by specific grant or throughRSG, there would be some permanent addition to public expenditure.iiImplementation of the scheme I12.   Amendments to main legislation would be needed:-a. to require local education authorities, where they exercise their discretion to pay allowances in respect of pupils/studentsover compulsory school age (at present payable under Section 311Education Act, 1944, and Section 2, Education Act, 1962, toadopt rates of grant and assessment arrangements laid down inregulations made by the Secretaries of State;rb. to empower the Secretaries of State to make such regulations;c. to empower the Secretaries of State to pay grants in respecEof such allowances paid by local education authorities (Section3and 8, Local Government Act, 1974).
CONFlDtW i iML13*    If   such a scheme were approved,en appropriate an*cnuineirt could be introduced &quot;to the current..Education Bill during the Committee stage in the House of Lords(early October).14-. If this programme were adhered to, the necessary regulationscould he made in time for the scheme to be brought into operation in April 1977.\

jKNEX, CJOB RELEASE SCHEMEOutline of the scheme-   The scheme which would be rim by the Department of Employment, would offer-to workers wliose place of employment was in the Assisted Areas, and who were within ayear of minimum pensionable age, an allowance until they reached that age, provided they left their jobs and were replaced by mienployed workers from the unemployment&quot;gister.   There would be one rate of allowance,  23 por week, free of tax, for all,men or women, married or single.   Recipients would have to undertake not to seekemployment, nor to apply for unemployment or incapacity benefits without informing the DE.   The scheme would be open from 1 January 1977 to j50 June 1977.   The effect the employment of young persons should be no more or less than the effect of*by increase in the demand for labour generally.poets and Effects2*  Only experience can tell what the take-up would be.   The more conditions built intothe scheme the lower the take-up will be.   The response to the complicatedBelgian scheme has been dericorily low.   On the assumption that the scheme doesnot extend to the unemployed and there is a W take-up among the employed, 62,000allowances would be paid.   Assuming 10*5 are not replaced at all the effect on employment is 56,000.   Persons from the &quot;stock&quot; would draw the allowance for an&quot;Wage period of ?  months, persons from the &quot;flow&quot; for 12 months.   On a &quot;12 monthequivalent&quot; basiB the effect on employment would be Ml ,000 not 56,000.   As only a proportion of the replacements come from the unemployment register, there would be* reduction in the register of 48,000 (37,000 annual equivalent).   These figuresthat 40,000 persons would start drawing allowances early in the life of theScheme, a maximum number of 50,000 would be drawing allowances in the 4th to 6th&quot;onths nnd the number would decline thereafter over 12 months.3-  The gross cost of such a scheme would be  57 million and the net cost  19 million.*dditicnally, there would be administrative costs of about  2 million.   The net cost*** year of the 37,000 (annual equivalent) taken off the register would be  570-
The staff requirement is now expected to be rather larger than reported to Minister^]when they last discussed the scheme.   55 staff will be required in DE to make payraeBof the allowances and 50 in DH&amp;S to deal with the claims for supplementary benefitthat will arise in a proportion of cases.   These requirements will persist through to June 1978 though they will be tapering off in the last few months.   Additionally80 staff will be needed in the ESA till June 1977 to administer the replacementcondition.   So there is a requirement of 185 staff till June 1977 and 100 staffthereafter to June 1978, tapering off in the last few months.Advantages and Disadvantages*u The scheme is attractive in theory, acting directly to reduce the size of they^-&apos; labour force and hence, for a given number of jobs, the level of unemployment. Th^inet coat per person taken off the register is low. The main snag, especially if tlscheme is overloaded with conditions, is that the take-up might turn out to be much;lower than assumed above. (On the other hand, lower take-up would reduce the costpro rata).   Intensive publicity of the scheme would be needed.5.   There is the risk that the scheme could be looked upon as a tentative first mo&apos;in the direction of general earlier retirement though this would be minimised byemphasising from the outset that the scheme is a temporary one and by the fact tha*would be funded and administered by the Department of Employment.   It could alsodifficult once the scheme is introduced to limit it to the Assisted Areas, givenhigh unemployment is spread throughout the country.   It could also work against tMintention of the industrial strategy by making it more difficult for employers toreduce their labour force through wastage to retirement without replacement - thouas against that, the scheme would be replacing workers in their sixties by more active younger workers.*6.   It would be desirable to maximise the replacement rate.   The scheme envisagedrequires the employer concerned to replace any older worker electing to take the allowance.   Some employers may succeed in getting round this requirement.   On the \other hand, the requirement (and, a fortiori, the strengthening of it) has the disadvantage that it will tend, to reduce the percentage take up.
7-   The CBI, TUC and MSC have been consulted about the scheme.   The TUC very muchwelcomed the scheme.   The CBI said that, in the short time available, it had only beenpossible to have limited consultations and while the outcome of these was mixed,there was little doubt that employers wished to assist, wherever possible, in^leviating the current serious unemployment problem, particularly amongst youngerPeople.   The CBI said that the voluntary removal of older employees from the labour market under reasonable financial provision was obviously one way of achieving this . - -though the title of the scheme was a misnomer and should properly explain what it is designed to do - encourage employees to retire.   However, employers saw short termWployment palliatives as no substitute for sensible long term economic policies and*&quot;tployers have very serious reservations about the possibility of introducing a scheme*uch as had been described.   The MSC have not yet expressed a view.8*   Six points were raised in the consultations which require decisions on the scopeof, and detailed arrangements for, the scheme:-(1)   The CBI pointed out that tho direct replacement of older workers by much youngerones is Tint normal industrial practice.   There is almost always a chain reaction withJferioua promotions or work rearrangements taking place which may ultimately admit&quot;  2? the employment of a replacement at or near the bottom of the age and/or skill scale.jheir general view is that any scheme must take account of the chain reaction that occursj-h an organisation when an employee leaves, otherwise its   scope will bo very limited.The TUC took the same view as the CBI.   There seems no reason why replacementPf a worker other than the worker going into retirement should not satisfy   the replacement condition of the scheme, provided the employer can satisfactorily explain^the chain of moves.   Otherwise we should be building an extremely severe restrictioniato the scheme.   What is in mind is that the local employment office would offer to replace the older worker in his job.   If the employer said he did not want adirect replacement because of some &quot;chain reaction&quot;, the local office would ask fordetails and offer to replace the worker vacating the Job at the end of the chain.The TUC suggest that for a period of 6 months the employer should be required to notify the local office if he dismisses the replacement and to recruit a second
replacement.   This is a logical condition but it would require flexible and, therefocomplicated instructions to implement because, in some cases, the circumstances of a firm may change and it may move into a situation where it would have made the olderworker redundant, had he not already retired, and wishes to make the replacementredundant.   There would be a heavy staff requirement to police such a condition andit could prove a deterrent to employers.   We do not recommend adopting this conditi(2)   Some confusion exists about the concept of the weighted average allowance thatis proposed should be paid.   This may well be below the current level of uncmploymegpay to which the employee miffht otherwise be entitled, and may therefore not be asufficient incentive for an employee to ro early.   Both the TUC and CBI made this we did not specify what the amount of the allowance might -be when we consulted the TUC and CBI.   The figure we have had in mind is a flat rate tax free allowance of  23*    23 is a weighted average of what persons in receipt of NI retirement penswill be receiving after the increases in November.   It is higher in reality because it is proposed that the allowance should be tax free whereas the retirement pensiontaxable.   The allowance compares similarly with flat rates of unemployment benefitexcept that UB is also tax free.   On the other hand, during the first six months ofunemployment, some workers get an earnings related supplement on top of the flat rapayment.   Because the allowance is at the same rate for everyone, it will be veryattractive to some workers (particularly women and single men) and much less attracto others (particularly high earning married men).   The Manpower Group is satisfiedthat a  23 flat rate tax free allowance is sufficient for the purposes of the schew(3)   The TDC and CBI were asked if they thought there should be an upper age limitreplacements.   The TUC did not favour such a limit; the CBI did not comment.t i     The Belgian scheme incorporates an upper age limit.   Under their scheme any maged 62 or more or any woman aged 58 or more has the right to demand a pre-pensionif the enterprise concerned employs 50 or more, the employer is obliged to releaseor her and to accept a replacement less than 30 years old, unemployed and recruited from outside the enterprise.   In enterprises employing 20-50, the employer is allo
two months within which to recruit the replacement.   In smaller firms he is allowedto refuse to replace.   The operation of the scheme is supervised by the Department offinployment and the Works Council concerned.   However, the Belgians have recently beenrevising the rules of their scheme because of very low take-up.   We recommend againsthaving an upper ago limit because of its restricting effect.^)   Should persons be allowed to draw^the^ allowance and engage in part-timeemplovm^fc subject to an enrninfis limit?   The TUG were not in favour of this; theJ?BI had no view.This would unduly complicate the administration of a temporary scheme.   We doaot favour it.^5)   Should persons drawing the allowance he allowed to Rive it up and return togSPloyment?   Both the TUC and CBI thought this right.We agree with the TUC and CBI that people must have the right to change their minds,   it would, in any case, be impracticable to insist otherwise.^   Should the scheme extend to the registered unemployed?   Both the TUC and CBIfought so.She arguments for inclusion of the unemployed are:-(i)    It would greatly increase the reduction in registered unemploymentbrought about by the scheme.   The effect on the unemployment register(annual equivalent) would be increased from 37*000 to 30,000. the gross cost of the scheme would be increased from  57 million to 71 million and the net cost from  19 million to  25 million.The net cost per year of each person taken off the register wouldbe reduced from  570to  5^0.(ii) In equity it seems unjust to deprive those who have alreadysuffered the misfortune of unemployment of the opportunity to take part in the scheme if they wish.(iii) The removal of those willing to take part in the scheme from thelabour market would reduce the competition for such jobs as wereavailable, for others on the unemployed register.
(iv)   The existence of the scheme might well substantially reduce their chances ofobtaining employment, since employers could take the view that the employment]of a person eligible for the scheme runs a risk of an early request for aJob Release.(v)   They are unlikely to have much faith in the efforts of the EmploymentServices to find jobs for them, if the Government are actively encouragingthose near retirement to leave employment.The arguments against the inclusion of the existing unemployed are;-(i)   It puts up the cost of the scheme.(ii)   Since no jobs would be released for other unemployed to take up, theinclusion would be criticised as being for the sole purpose of achieving a paper reduction in the numbers unemployed.(iii)   This extension would provide a ready method of circumventing the replacementcondition of the main scheme, in that where a worker wishes to leave hisjob, but his employer is unable or unwilling to accept a replacement, hemerely leaves his employment, signs the register and obtains his JobRelease Allowance.   Rules would have to be devised to prevent this happeningIf the scheme were to be extended to the unemployed, it would be desirableto exclude persons at present in retirement, drawing occupational pensions,who were not registered as unemployed at the time of the announcement on August 1976 by the Secretary of State for Employment that the scheme wasbeing considered.   In the light of the support of the TUC and CBI for including the unemployed within the scope of the scheme the group (withthe exception of the Treasury) on balance favour their inclusion.E However, the DHSS pointed out that such a decision would not be altogetherconsistent with legislation currently in train to prevent occupationalpsnsiorBrs from drawing unemployment benefit.
9* Other points which have been raised on the proposals, with a comment in each case,are set out below.   The first seven emanate from the CBI(l)  The existence of such a scheme should not be seen as implying that any vacancythat occurs through early retirement should automatically be filled.

If an employer does not want to replace the older worker then the older worker cannot get the allowance.   Of course, it is open40 the employer to induce him to retire without an allowance, or to make him&quot;rtundant.   A scheme with the essential feature of replaceaent, could not allow an*Woyer not to replace in a case where the allowance was being paid.(2)  Despite the assurances that are to be sought from those to be retired early,4Lwili be almost impossible, particularly in certain industriesr to ensure thatjfepjio not go in for lobbing or eelf-erroloved work of some kind.i    She situation is basically the same as for unemployment benefit and sickness^fit.   The Department of anployment would require declarations from the persondeemed and, of course, take action where it caao to attention that there had in&apos;act been employment.Very serious problems will arise for those who retire early in respect of anytgsaion, insurance and other related benefits to which they may be entitled, whether^ ftftwpanv. state or tr.de union based.   Satisfactorily resolving the question&apos; 3L*UelbilitY for national insurance contributions only goes part of the way towards SSglving this problem.It has to be accepted that the rules of occupational pension schemes may get1(1 the way of employees electing to take the allowance.   We can only ask employers to operate to the extent possible.   The employer must decide what he is able to do.
just as the employee must decide whether or not to apply for the allowance, in thelight of any effect this may have on his entitlement to an occupational pension.   Sofar as the state retirement pension is concerned, DHSS advise that virtually no onewill lose entitlement.(4)   Problems are envisaged jn cases where a new employee is recruited and then the senior one, for whatever reason, decides not to retire early.This kind of problem (and there will no doubt be many) will have to be sorted o*Ias the procedures for operating the scheme are worked out in detail and in the lightsof experience.(5)   In the event of the scheme proving popular and to enable an employer to protect the effectiveness of his own operation, he should have the right to limit the numbewho wish to take advantage of it.The employer can control the numbers by refusing to make replacements.(6)   Many employers see real difficulty for the Department in monitoring a schpme sgjBas is proposed.   It will either be widely abused or require a vast re^ulatin^ staffjga relatively short period of time that is out of all proportion to the importance of.the scheme.The antithesis between elaborate checking of the replacement condition andabuse (and, therefore, waste of public money) is a false one.   It would have beenpossible to have had a scheme without a replacement condition and relied on the nortffftendency for employers to fill vacancies caused by retirement.   What is beingaimed at is a sensible level of basic checks with an acceptable corresponding staffjjjrequirement.   The staff requirement for payments will be less than we originallythought as we have now arranged that the payments should be made with the aid of a jjcomputer.(7)   There are no direct incentives to the employer for taking; on a younger person who will require training and acclimatisation in the job before he adequately
iB true.   We are dependent on the collaboration of employers.(8)   What are the problems of abuse?   Is there any difficulty in preventing those wfto&quot; ggeive the allowance from also obtaining unemployment benefit?   Is there a oroblcr.Supplementary Benefit and if so what?   Are there problems on other social securitrbefits?   Does the limitation to particular areas cause problems of evasion?Persons would not be entitled to draw the allowance who exercised any rights***** might have to draw unemployment or sickness benefit.   Administrative checks areb*being devised to prevent duplicate payments.   Receipt of the allowance would not be- aba* to claiming and drawing Supplementary Benefit.   The scheme would be restrictedt0 Persons employed in Assisted Areas-   If anyone left employment in a non-Assisted**** to take employment in an Assisted Area in order to become eligible for the^lowance that would be all to the good from the point of view of maximising take-up.(9)  What would be the effect on the other benefits to which those retiring earlySife be entitled eK redundancy payments, occupational pensions schemes (take, forSggple. one or two for the maior nationalised industries), achievement of number ofSSSLifylnp payments for full NT pensions?Persons taking the allowance will not be entitled to redundancy payments because**** will be leaving their employment voluntarily.   So far as occupational pension^es are concerned this has been dealt with in (3) above.   In regard to the ability of granting NI credits to those in receipt of the allowance, DHSS haveagainst this, pointing out that the numhera who would benefit from such an^&quot;ngement are extremely small indeed.Uo)  la it likely that the scheme would be taken up by a much larger proportion of-SEjwen than the men who would be eligible?^he answer iB no. It is true that the allowance is a higher proportion of womcn&apos;s***s than of men, but 60 is not a normal retiring age for women in the same way that8 for men.   This is because the ages at which most women become eligible for NI*****ement pension is governed by their husbands&apos; ages not their own.   So it is thought* lower proportion of women would he interested in retirement at 59 than of men Rt
TEMPQKAHY EMPLOYMENT SUBSIDY ; EXTENSIONOutline of the scheme.   The Temporary Employment Subsidy (TES) scheme was introduced on lo August 1976.Qn a limited basis to provide a subsidy to employers who agree to defer redundancies*hich would otherwise take place.   It has since been extended in time, scope andvalue, and now provides a payment of  20 per week for up to 12 months for eachredundancy deferred, but the scheme is due to end on 31 December 1976 i-e. no application will be received after that date, although payments will continue, as appropriate, until the end of 1977.   It is for consideration whether this scheme should he extended for a further period, such as 6 months.gosts and Effects2&quot;   It is expected that the total number of workers covered by the TES scheme*Ul be up to 190,000 by the present closing date, at a total gross cost of  175m.scheme is not directed specifically at young people, but a recent survey of its operation by the Department of Employment suggests that about 10* of those coveredBJT the scheme are aged 20 or less.  Were applications to remain at their present^el, a 6 month extension could cover an additional 100,000 workers.   In oure*perience not all payments run the full 12 months.   That reduces the 100,000an &quot;annual equivalent&quot; basis to 86,000 and the gross cost works out at  90 million.If the TES is not extended the number covered by the scheme will start to declinefrom let January 1977 onwards.   If the scheme is extended for 6 months the numbercovered will continue to rise till about April or May and then start to fall slowly,tfte rate of fall increasing at the end of June.&amp;   In assessing the true effect of the expenditure it is necessary to allow forfactors.   The first is that, now the scheme has been running for a year, there willbe an increasing tendency for a proportion of the jobs preserved by the TES to be attn* expense of jobs displaced elsewhere in the economy.   The second is that for every** preserved by the TES other jobs (or a fraction of a job) will be preserved in^PPlying industries.   The following figures assume that the net effect of these two factors during the period of extension of the scheme will be to reduce the 86,000
jobs already mentioned by 50 per cent or to 60,000.   Assuming that 70 per cent(a rather lower proportion than the average because of the relatively high proportionof women in the TES population) would have signed the unemployment register that means that the net effect of the expenditure   on the unemployment register is ^2,000(annual equivalent).   PS3R savings at  40 a week for 52 weeks on 60,000 persons would be  125 million, so there could be a net saving in.the next 18 months of betweenfclOw and ty^\.k.   The Treasury incline to the view that the adjustment (for displacement andConcentsupplying industries)   could be TO per cent within 18 months and S0% ultiaatsly./the n-..&apos;X5 lS months this v.would  rt.-ducc tht:/net effect of the expenditure proposed on the unemployment register from ^2,000to 56,000.   There would still be a net. saving though much smaller.5.   To administer the extension, the existing kO staff employed on the scheme wouldhave to be kept on for 6 months longer than intended, before being gradually reduced in number. -Advantages and disadvantages6.   The main arguments in favour of extending the TES, as opposed to introducingnew types of subsidy, are that it is a going concern, it has got through its period ofbuild-up and is well known, and the effects of additional expenditure on it arecomparatively easy to estimate.   Ab against that, the longer the scheme goes on the tootemployers will &quot;adjust their affairs&quot; to take advantage of it i.e. they will come to &amp;conclusion that redundancies are required at an earlier date than they would have dons &apos;there had been no TES.   This is not a matter of deliberate deception, merely that th^ifjudgements of the point in time when redundancies are necessary (and this is commonlya matter of judgement) are bound to be affected by their knowledge that the schemeexists.   Moreover, there will not be as much attempt made by employers and unions to minimise the number of redundancies as there would be if they had to be implemented&apos;extremeBut even if the costings are adjusted to make/allowance for these tendencies (by adjusting the displacement effect from 50 per cent to 60 per cent) the net cost pernet job week changes only from a negative figure to a positive figure of  14 a week.
?-   As an listing schema it cannot be; expt-selected that        vill have the same public*&quot;pact as a measure to deal with unemployment as a nww scheme.8-    U might also be argued that the TrS, as the economy moves into the up-turn, vill yhunter to the aims of the industrial strategy in that it may subsidise the inefficientttm at the expense of the efficient and inhibit the transfer of labour, froa declining8*ctors  of industry to thost- sectors vlu-rc expansion is possible.9-    There are some difficulties in administering the T^.   There is an atkuard crea of*wlap between the Tia end tbe provision of rescue assistance under the Industry Act.**&quot;*ni0*rative arrangements prevent duplication of payment but in some cases it h&amp;s prov*iWicult to decide whether to pay TiS or l*ave the cose to be dealt with under theIndilUs*ry Act.*       past form,the rJiC Commission vill not like a further extension of tht- subsidy.
