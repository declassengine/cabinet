INDUSTRIAL SUPPORT AND POST OFFICE INVESTMENTMemorandum by the Chief Secretary. treasury.     In the discussions by the Ministerial Committee (El) onEconomic and Industrial Policy of proposals for increased expenditure on selective assistance to industry, the Secretary ofState for Industry has suggested that possible savings to coverpart of the cost of these proposals could be secured by a re-assessment of Post Office finances, arising from a reduction intheir investment plans.     I have already made clear, in paragraph of the paper circulated under cover of CP(76)96, ay belief thatthis approach is not open to us.     El have invited me to circulate a note to Cabinet explaining the reasons for this view in more detail.2.     In July we decided to change the treatment of nationalised industry investment in the public expenditure Surveys and white papers.    The arguments in favour of this were that the procedures for dealing with public expenditure generally were unsuitable tobe applied to these industrial investment programmes; that it was out of keeping with the increased emphasis on control of theirfinancing requirements, to which the cash limits for the nationalised industries are related; and we did not want the investment figures for the new nationalised industries to featureas an offset to the public expenditure reductions which were beingannounced.     As a result this capital expenditure, as such, is not now part of public expenditure.     This change has now been made public and cleared with the Expenditure Committee and there canbe no going back on it.3.     Instead, it is only Government funds provided to the nation-nationalised industries, whether by Government loans, public dividendcapital or grants, which are treated as public expenditure.     Thet
Secretary of State&apos;s proposal could therefore be entertainedonly if we could ourselves be certain that it would reduceGovernment spending in this sense as compared with some clearlyestablished baseline, and if we could also be sure ofdemonstrating this to the public and the Expenditure Committeein a convincing fashion.4.     In my view, we are not in a position to satisfy ourselves on either count.   If we were to go down this route, we should have totake account, not only of the reduction in Post Office investment which^may or may not lead to reduced Government financing, butalso/the investment of the other nationalised industries, includingthe new nationalised industries, whose capital expenditure alsowill involve Government financing.   We cannot bring in the one case and leave out the others.5.     Even if the result of this approach were to show a saving inthe investment of the nationalised industries taken as a whole,there could be no assurance that this would lead, at the next stage, to a reduction in their total requirements for government finance.   The fact is that we do not yet know what, on the new basis, the provision for this Government financing to be includedin the public expenditure will be.   The figures are still beingworked out.   The nationalised industries have not hitherto been required to put in hard figures of this kind much in advance ofeach year&apos;s budget.   I think it a healthy development that theyare now required to think more in terms of their future external financial requirements, and not solely in terms of their grosscapital outlays, but we must recognise that practical difficulties are involved.6.     The new projections will have to take account of such factors as pricing policy, market forecasts and foreign borrowing.   Totake only one example in the areas for which the Secretary ofState for Industry has responsibility, the prospectiveborrowings by the British Steel Corporation are very uncertain andmay increase;    and the requirements for British Shipbuilders will
remain in doubt until a corporate strategy has been approved.Moreover, the total figures for external finance have to be broken down as between borrowing from the Government and fromother sources.7-     Finally, even if we can overcome these difficulties to ourown satisfaction, there would be no means of proving the point tothe outside world, including the Expenditure Committee.   Cmnd 6J93contains no projections of the financing requirements of the nationalised industries, and there is therefore no publishedbaseline to which the presumed saving could be related.   nor could we even claim that there had all along been any unpublishedGovernment baseline figures on the new basis which we could nowbring forward in evidence.8.     The Treasury have successfully steered through theExpenditure Committee the presentational changes on both the nationalised industries and debt interest, and we have so farsucceeded in getting a remarkably good Press reception for these changes.   An important reason for this is that we were notsuspected of any ulterior motive in trying to smuggle expenditureincreases through.   I have no doubt at all that an attempt topresent this reassessment of Post Office finances as an offset to increased expenditure for industrial support would be regarded in that light, and could lead to a reopening by the expenditure committee of the presentational changes which have already beenput to them.   It would be a great mistake to risk discreditingwhat has so far been secured on that front.
