PUBLIC EXPENDITURE - PROGRESS REPORT ON 1976-77 AND 1977-78Memorandum by the Chief SecretaryMy last progress report on public expenditure covered onlythe year 197G-77.    Now that we have announced decisions on expenditure in 1977-78, we need also to keep a careful watch on developments in that year, and I therefore attach a note coveringboth years.    The note does not deal with the employment packagewhich we are to consider on 23 September, which is includedseparately below.2.      The general position of the contingency reserve can besummarised as follows:-  million (1^76 Survey prices)1976-77 1977-781. Cmnd.6393 contingencyrcGcrve2. Agreed claims3. Balance in the reserve4. Employment package(including cost ofeducation maintenanceallowances)5. Other firm bids6. Other claims not firm8256821,05041214363824805389882137. Total of 4, 5 and 6157390
&apos; CONtMDENTIALWk323.      In 1976-77 the note shows that the  reserve would be exhausted by the firm bids and other claims which are already known,if they were nil accepted.    This figuring is moreover based on the assumptions that local authorities will  succeed in reducing the prospective overspending in their current expenditure;  that nofurther contingencies arise dur.ing the year;  and that there are noadverse fluctuations in the probable outturn of the &quot;relativejyuncontrollable&quot;  items mentioned in paragraph 5 of the note.    Allthese assumptions are inevitably uncertain.1377-784.      The more serious problem arises in 1977-78.    With 6 months to do  before the year begins, we have already reduced the reserve belowthe level which we provided for 1976-77 in Cmnd.6393.   There arealso some major potential claims, not all of which have yetcrystallised as bids recorded in the table.    At this stage, I willsingle out three for special comment.5.     First,  the problem of local authority current expenditure islikely to be just as difficult next year as it has been this year,and in managing the contingency reserve it would only be commonprudence to set aside a sum at least equal to this year&apos;s estimatedover-run until we can be sure that the authorities will comply withthe overall limit within which we have asked them to act.6.     Second, we shall need to consider the outcome of the work by officials on ways of making our industrial assistance moreselective.    At this stage I will state my own view that, in thelight of the figures given above, any such changes must be fullybalanced by reductions in other more general forms of assistance.7.     Third, the  recent rise in interest rates is likely to push upthe forecast housing subsidy bill in 1977-78 by a sum of the orderof  100 million or even more.    We shall need to look at this in the context of the housing programme as a whole, both for 1977-78 and later years, when firmer estimates are available.   Even if
offsetting measures can be found there is however a problem of timing, and any net excess in 1977-78 will, fall ultimately on thereserve.Oonc]usions8.      The position is therefore very tight for 1976-77* but providedwe continue to adhere to the policy of absorbing any new increasesby means of offsetting reductions, we should have a reasonable chanceof meeting our commitment to keep within the contingency reserve thisyear.    However, any new bids at this time of the year tend to spillover into, the following year.    Although on the face of it there ismore money left for 1977-78,  the difficulty of getting through thatyear with the contingency reserve which now remains is potentiallymuch more severe, and will require&apos; an even more stringent approach.Moreover it is essential that we should be able to show that the cutswhich we announced in July have in fact been implemented.9.      It is against this background that we have to examine thefurther proposals now before us for dealing with unemployment amongyoung people.   While I would not oppose some of the smaller items(i.-e.  extension of the job creation programme, training awards, orstrengthening the careers service), to find money for anythingbeyond that would pose very great difficulty.
CfAY tJiEiYfi AT,PUBLIC EXPHNDTTUKE : THE CONTINGENCY RESERVE IN 19/6-77 and 1977-78Introduceio n1.     The progress report considered by Cabinet on 29 July 1.976indicated that of (die contingency reserve for 1976-77 of  825million (at 1976 Survey prices), nearly  500 million had is 1 readybeen absorbed by agreed claims,  before account whs taken of the potential excess in local authority current expenditure and otherknown bids,  including the youth employment measures which were subsequently announced on 3 August,    This nbte brings up to date the position for 1976-77, and also reports on the current state ofthe reserve for 1977-78,  before taking account of the further proposals for assisting employment of young people, which are nowunder, consideration by Ministers.2.     The total of agreed claims for 1976-77 now amounts to  682million.    (Details are given in list A in Annex I).    This includesan increase since the last report of  2.5 million, of which the main items were  15 million for help to poorer energy consumers and cc / Augustf-o million for the cost in 1976-77 of thq/ youth employment measures3.     On local authority current expenditure, Ministers took decisionsbefore I he Recess which were designed to reduce the prospectiveoverspending in England and Wales by at least  100 milJion at 1976Survey prices.    On this basis it would bo prudent to assume flvatthere will be an excess in Great Britain (including the existingagreed claims for policenranpowcr)  of about  180 million, although this result is of course uncertain.    This has therefore also been allowed for in list A of Annex I.4. The firm bids and other claims have also been brought up to date and are included in lists B and C in Annex I.5-     This arithmetic does not include any allowance for probablefluctuations in expenditure on those services (e.g. social security)
CONKi wENTJ A I.where the outturn cannot be  directly canfroU eu once  the  levels  ofbeneTLt or other conditions have been f&quot;)w0.   In 1976-77-  the mainclaim now foreseen of this kind is  .153 million in respect of exportcredit refinance.    The Government liavt; now ivaciiod an agreement withthe clearing banks which w.i J 1 eliminate the additional requirementPreviously foreseen for 3 977-78,  but this will not produce a saving in the refinance required in 1976-77-    On the latest information,unattributod e.c. contributions are likely to he up by  27 million,compared with the reduction of  30 mil.lion noted in the PE3C report.An increase is now also forecast in the likely cost of the temporaryemployment subsidy under the existing scheme.    So far as can be seen,the net effect of fluctuations in probable outturn in this category of services is likely to be approximately balanced by the cstim-itin^reductions which were brought into account in the PESC report.    Thiswill however need to be kept under review,6.     Assuming therefore that the fluctuations mentioned in paragraph5 can be left aside as roughly self-balancing, the state of the contingency reserve can be summarised as follows:-  million(19/6 Survey prices;Cmnd.6393 contingency reserve 825Agreed claims to 17 September 682&apos;Balance 143Firm bids 80Other claims not firm 53A2ZZzZ87.     The last report covering 1977-78 was considered in May.    since then, a number of claims have been agreed for 1976-77 which alsoaffect 1977-78, and some of tho previous agreed claims have been-costed in the PESC report.   The present list of agreed claims isshown in Annex II, and totals   412  million.8.      The contingency reserve for that year, at 1976 Survey prices,
amount;  to  1050 million.    There  ic therefore  only  636    millionleft after allowing for thf agreed cljjiit-.    Annex IT alpo shoves thePresent  list of find bids simi uther poli;n!,ia L cla.ii.sp which aim-unr.to  30.1.    million.    These include  some  claims v.hich were left nsJdein the July di scissions on the.  grounds  that  they could be tivaLed   inthe n;;xt White Paper as claims on the reserve (e.g,  the co^t of devolution);  some relatively minor bids which did not fit into l!ieframework of those discussions nnd on which decisions remain to be taken  if they cannot be fully offset;  and some new bids which have arisen si nee July.9.     The figure of  636    million is already considerably less thanthe amount included for the comparable year in the last White paper(i.e. the Cmnd.6393 contingency reserve for 1.976-77 which was  825million at 1976 Survey prices).    But the figure given in Cmnd.6393was published in February, just before the beginning of 1976-77,w&apos;iereas there iy still half a year to go before the beginning of1977-78.    Moreover, the figure of  636 million almost certainlygives too favourable an impression of the real position for thefollowing combination of reasons:--   (a) Apart from police manpower, Annex II takes no account of any additional bids on local authority current expenditure.    Onthis, the Governments general stance is that there can be no increase on the Cmnd.6393 figures (unless offset by reductions in capital spending) and that grant will only be paid on that basis.    Further thought still needs to bo given to themeasures which will have to be taken in order to keepexpenditure within this level in spite of the expected excessin. 1976-77.    But even when this has been done, we must reckonwith the possibility that the local authorities maynevertheless overspend in spite of it,  just as they now scornlikely to do this year.(b) In addition, the forecast level, of housing subsidies maywell rise by  100 million or more because of the recent risein interest rates.
C0W]DKNT1\L(c) Tin: civil service staff savings announced on 29 July d.i dnot amount Lo the  figure  indicated  jn Cmnd.6393.    Unless anyfurther staff savings are identified,  the balance of  18   .million will  adversely affect  the overall comparison withCmnd.6393.(d) Ministers have not yt;t taken decisions on the measuresforeshadowed in July for making industrial assistance moreselective,  including greater use of the National EnterpriseBoard and the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies.Nationalised 1ndustriesH.    This note has been prepared on the same basis as earlierprogress reports on the contingency reserve.    When decisions havebeen taken on the new presentation of nationalised industryexpenditure,  it will be necessary to examine how the figures willappear under the new presentation.    As however the hulk of the claimsagreed so far have been for other programmes,  it secrns unlikely thatthe problem will be significantly eased on this account.
