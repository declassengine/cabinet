(confidential)PUBLIC EXPENDITURE:    PROGRAMME ANALYSIS AND REVIEVMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryAt the meeting of the Cabinet on 20 May 1976  (CM(76)6th Conclusions),the Chancellor of the Exchequer was asked to circulate an assessment of the value of the programme analysis and review (PAR)  system.Introduction2.    At present our aim in managing public expenditure must be to release sufficient resources for exports and investment by restrainingthe claims of the public sector.    The techniques and procedures whichwe use to examine expenditure programmes must anyway be geared to thiscentral and overriding aim.    It is also vitally important that a thorough and objective appraisal is made before any new policy orprogramme is launched.    Better analysis at that stage would save ustreatly in both trouble and money thereafter.    But this does notremove the need for periodical reviews of the programmes which areAlready running,  to see whether their objectives are still valid,and if so, whether they could now be met in a better and more economical way.    This kind of stocktaking was of course going on long before the previous Government introduced a specific procedure called&quot;programme analysis  and review&quot;,   and the need for it has never been seriously questioned.    Indeed, when we discussed public expenditurelest December,  the Cabinet specifically asked for an examination of areas where a fundamental review might lead to savings in the longerUrau3*   In many cases, proposals for such periodical reviews come forwardiQ the ordinary course of business,  e.g.,  the recent Defence Review.But this does not necessarily ensure that the whole field of Govern-&quot;ent activity is systematically reviewed over a period of time.    the far system was set up to fill this gap.    It was intended to operateeo an annual cycle, beginning with the commissioning of a programmeof analytical studies,  through to the collective Ministerial discussionof each of the completed reports, with the aid of a collective briefby the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS)  relating the particular&quot;Objects to wider Government strategy.    The main feature of PAR studies*** to be a greater emphasis on defining objectives and expressingprnji ssssum in output terms;    and on considering alternative optionsfor achieving the defined objectives.    The Treasury and CPRS were to** involved in each study when its form, coverage and analyticalApproach were determined and when the policy options and conclusions**** discussed.t*   Vhem we came into office in 1974, we agreed to continue this procedure, although with a less rigid annual timetable, subject to review in the light of experience.1(confidential)0 jj- -
(confidential)Assessment5.    I attach an assessment by officials of the value of the PAR systMost of the major PAR reviews have been worthwhile, but these wouldhave been undertaken if PAR had not existed.    Many of the reviews of smaller programmes have also been useful;    and some of these might tiOhave been done without the stimulus of PAR,  although others could welhave been done in the ordinary course of business.    Few PARs have leto proposals for expenditure savings;    but most have illuminated polchoices and helped rational decision-taking,  either by indicatingpriorities or by putting emphasis on new areas needing attention.6.    On the other hand, PAR studies have been costly in staff,  and sometimes have absorbed more effort than was really justified.    Ther*has been too much striving to find topics to make up an annualprogramme,  with the result that some subjects have been badly chosen,and the choice has not been selective enough.    In some cases reviewshave been overtaken by events before they could be completed and        tconsidered.    While officials are agreed that analytical policy revie;will still be needed,  the arrangements need to be more selective and,flexible than under the present PAR system.(i)    whether special arrangements are still needed to ensure tbkind of periodical reviews mentioned in paragraph 3 above;(ii)    whether we should continue to give such arrangements theOn the first,  it remains vitally important - given the limitation of resources - that we must not spend more on public expenditure progrthan is absolutely essential to meet their objectives;    and that noprogramme should continue after the original motive for it has cease to apply.    We still need to supplement the annual expenditure surveyby a process which brings the need and justification of the programmunder critical scrutiny at regular intervals.    But this process mustbe flexible and capable of responding to new needs and changing circumstances -8.    As a general rule,  therefore, we should leave departments free tpropose or initiate reviews of spending programmes without waiting fthe compilation of an annual programme of studies.    The initiative *be taken by either spending departments or the central departments;and such matters as the depth of analysis required and the extent ofinvolvement of the central departments can be left to the normal proof inter-departmental discussion.    But it would still be useful for to take stock,  at least once a year, of the list of all major ongoi:and already planned reviews.    We could then consider&quot;Ta) whether th*balance of this work fits in with our own political priorities,(b) whether there are any particular areas, especially those whichProposals for the future7.There are two main questions to be decided:-label  &quot;PAR&quot;.2
(confidential)transcend departmental boundaries, which have not been criticallyanalysed for some time and on which a study should now be launched.We could also consider whether there are any of the existing, plannedor proposed studies with which we would like the central departments to be especially associated.9.   In view of the close link between this work and the expendituresurveys,  I suggest that the Public Expenditure Survey Committee shouldbe asked to provide the reports which would be the basis for thisstocktaking.    A suitable time might be when we are considering ourpublic expenditure priorities.    While any new studies proposed at that stage would not normally be completed in time to help in the current year&apos;s expenditure discussions,  the results should be available tosupport our discussions of priorities and expenditure programmes in;subsequent years.c.e10. The studies listed in  4 76)19 as already in progress or recommended for starting in 1976 could (as most already are)  go ahead as planned.11.    If these recommendations are acceptable,  it leaves the remainingquestion whether we continue to label this process &quot;PAR&quot;.    There is acase for discarding the label, which is not essential and attractsundue public attention.    But to drop its use could cause unecessaryand slmost certainly exaggerated criticism which should be avoided atthis time.    We shall either be accused of losing interest in the kindof analysis and review process which it symbolises;    or,  if we explain that we are abandoning only the name not the process,  it could appearto be a device to sidestep the current request of the expenditure committee to see PAR reports.    On balance,  I would favour retaining:tbe PAR description provided we can announce the modified nature ofthe process as only one of a wide range of analytical and reviewactivities.    A low key announcement through an arranged parliamentary question might serve best.Disclosure of PAR studies12.    At our meeting on 20 May,  a question was raised about the disclosure of PAR studies.    This is a point which has been consideredbefore and is raised again in the Tenth Report of the expenditure committee.    The problem is that once it is known that a particulartopic is the subject of a special procedure,  this provokes requests^to publish the report.    We will not always want to publish the full!report, which also embodies policy advice to Ministers of a kind whichhas always been regarded as part of the normal internal processes ofGovernment.    I would however favour our doing more to publish thefactual material which has been collected for policy reviews, whetherPAR or otherwise,  and,  in appropriate cases, Green Papers or consuMa-tlve documents covering the policy options.    This would reflect oui*aiar for improving public access to official information.    Whateverwe decide to do about PAR,  I think we should continue to say that wedo not disclose the subjects which have been treated in this way (norpublish the Reports as such)  although material from them may bepublished,  e.g.,  in White or Green Papers or departmental publications.This is the line which we (and our predecessors when in office)  have consistently taken,  and which was restated earlier this year by me ina Parliamentary Answer. ,(confidential)
(confidential)V13.    In the case mentioned by the then Secretary of State for education,  the existence of two PAR studies became indirectly known   \y.to the Education Sub-Committee of the Expend!ture Committee,  and ?although the Opposition (who were then in power when the studies wer*j;done)  had no objection to their being shown in confidence to the Sub-,Committee,  the Secretary of State felt that even such limited dis-closure would be damaging,  and would also lead to other similarrequests.    He subsequently confirmed to the Sub-Committee that these.!.PAR Reports could not be made available to them.    In its subsequent   h*Tenth Report,  the Expenditure Committee has indicated that it will     .ntake up the wider issues raised by its wish to see PAR Reports ;ijapublished.    It also recommends that its Education Sub-Committee be notified about PAR exercises undertaken by the Department of Educatiand Science,  and seeks meetings between the Sub-Committee and the stconcerned.    These recommendations appear to be in part prompted by *iif*misconception that PAR plays a more important part in departmentalpolicy-making than in practice it has.    An announcement on the line* ?!envisaged above should help to clarify this misunderstanding,  and greater readiness to make factual material available should helpgenerally in relations with the Expenditure Committee. \&apos;Conclusions 55&apos;&amp;14.    I invite my colleagues:-- .4(a) to agree that we should adopt the proposals set out in        &apos;\sparagraphs 8-9 above j . ^$(b) to agree that we should continue to use the expression&quot;PAR&quot; as a shorthand description for this procedure, -f-but with a suitable public explanation; ^(c) to agree that the studies listed in 0(76)19 as already        ivin progress or recommended for starting in I976  should go ahead as planned; j(d) to agree that we should continue our policy of notdisclosing the subject of PAR studies, nor publish the        ^Reports as such, but should endeavour to do more to ^publish the factual material collected for all policy         &amp;reviews,  and where appropriate,  to consider Green Papersor similar publications on the policy options. ^(confidential)
CONFIDENTIALASSESSMENT OF THE FAR SYSTEMANNEXNote by OfficialsSince the introduction of the PAR system by the previous adminiatra-*ion in 1971, 34 studies have been completed and 14 are in progress which completion of 2 has been deferred tenporarily, one is in abeyance and 7 should be completed during 1976).   Expenditure on theProgrammea covered by these studies at 1975 prices is, very roughly,&quot;omewhat over 50 per cent of total public expenditure in 1975-76.2.    Over half of this total is represented by a few studies of**dor programmes.   These have yielded or can be expected to yieldimportant results, relevant to decision taking.   For example, the*&amp;ift of priority from higher education to nursery and primaryQuestion, announced by the previous Government in the 1972 White**per on education was based partly on two PARs;   and the currenton priorities in the Health end Personal Social Services&quot;would be a significant contribution to rational decision making.current Transport Policy Review and the shortly expectedBousing Finance Review also deal with important areas of policy.in all these cases, it is fair to a ay that these reviews would***e been put in hand anyway.   It is difficult to judge how different*ke results would have been if they had not been done under the PAR*Jateo.5&quot;    Most of the remaining PAR reviews have been concentrated on***Uer programmes and many of them have produced useful results.^&quot;*plea axe Tourism, which led to a switch of emphasis of**penditure from general promotion to concentration on directing*0*rt.ats towards the assisted areas in support of wider regional^Ucy objectives;   the Rural Depopulation PAR which produced a**Port which Ministers judged worthy (suitably edited) for. publicationled to the endorsement of more effort on developing industry andtoUriam end promoting the development of small towns (though for****aclng within existing allocation).   The Urban Deprivation PAR^ to the development of the concept of Comprehensive Community*So8Pammesw ?rom experience of these and of similar PAR studies
carried out under the previous Government, it ia judged that someof these smaller reviews might not have been done without the stimulus of the PAR system.   Moreover most of them have benefitedfrom the inter-departmental nature of PAR, and the width of approach which is valuable for the purpose of analytical review and consideraof options.4.     On the other hand PAR studies are expensive in terms of theuse of manpower, especially scarce specialist staff.   A fair numberof PAH reviews do not seem to have justified the effort put intothem.   This is not necessarily a criticism of the PAR system, but of the way it has been operated.   This may be due to a number of factors;   the annual PAR programming exercise designed to produce a list of candidates has meant too much striving to find subjects and insufficient selectiveness for important topics that would not otherwise he studied adequately.   Sometimes the fact that a review was called &quot;PAR&quot; led to over-lengthy and elaborate reports.   Some-times a subject may be unsuitable, perhaps because the main policy options are effectively foreclosed;   or the focus of the PAR maybe too narrow, so that the study becomes a question of how to do something rather than whether to do it.   In some cases, moreover,because of the depth of the study and the time it takes, a FARhas been overtaken by political events or other developments 30that the end product is side-tracked (although the analysis is notwasted, since the material can be used thereafter for other purposed)5.     Over the same period a number of policy reviews have been undertaken independently of PAR which have contributed to importantpolicy developments and which are equal in quality to any of the far studies - for example, reviews of forestry policy (under theprevious Government) and (under the present Government) agriculturalpolicies which resulted in Cmnd 6020 &quot;Pood from Our Own Hesources&quot;ithe Defence Review, &quot;Review of the Financial Aspects of   Poverty&quot; *and some industrial policy studies.   It could not be argued on thebasis of this experience that it was impossible to get satisfactorypolicy reviews without the benefit of the PAR system.6.    These considerations suggest that while many PAR reviews havebeen worthwhile, their contribution to policy development has notbeen essentially different from the best inter-departmental non- AB
reviews;   and that there is no reason why the PAR. emphasis on policy objectives, effectiveness and alternative options shouldnot be generalised to cover all policy reviews, not oust thoseincluded in the PAR programme.   There are clear advantages to departments and their Ministers in carrying out more fundamentaland rigorous reviews of their policies at a time when constraintson public expenditure make it imperative to use resources to the test advantage and with strict attention to priorities.7-    However, there are certain characteristic features of thePAH approach which seem worth retaining in any modification of thepresent system.   These are:-(a) Regular annual stocktaking of studies in progress andselection of further topics for review.(b) The role of the Central Departments.   For some majortopica there is advantage in their being able toparticipate not only on the substance, but on the selection of subjects for review and on terms ofreference and the way the study itself should proceed.Cc)   Collective consideration by Ministers.   This would dependon the scope, importance and timeliness of the review study8-    The conclusion reached by officials is that there is value in^dertaking more fundamental analytical reviews of programmes and policy options, whether called PAR or not, than ia practicablewithin the course of the annual Public Expenditure Survey;   and*nat the emphasis should be on making a more selective choice ofObjects for study which offer the prospect of securing policyGanges leading to savings or increased effectiveness of limitedexpenditure.
