THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAjESTY&apos;S government cp(76) 95 COPY NO        G125 October 1976CABINETTHE QUEEN&apos;S SPEECHES ON THE PROROGATION OF parliament and THE OPENING OF THE NEW session memorandum by the Lord chancellor. I attach, for consideration by the Cabinet, drafts of The Queen&apos;speeches on the Prorogation of the current Session of Parliament and theOpening of the new Session, which have been prepared by The Queen&apos;speeches and Future Legislation (QF) Committee,2.        Because of the substantial amount of Parliamentary time expected tobe required for the Scotland and Wales Bill, the draft Opening Speechpromises fewer Bills than is normal.    With one exception, the Speech refersonly to those Bills, of sufficient importance to warrant a mention, which:-a. are In the Essential category - Including some which have become Essential since the Cabinet discussed the legislative programme on 18 May;b. have been added to the programme by decision of the Cabinetsince May - In particular, those arising from the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s statement of 22 July on public expenditure; orc. the Cabinet placed in the first priority category In theprovisional programme.The exception Is the Patents Bill, a second priority Bill which the QFCommittee included In the draft Speech because its Introduction next Sessionis essential If the United Kingdom Is to ratify the European PatentConvention before it comes Into force next year.3.        Departmental Ministers responsible for some of the other secondpriority Bills requested that they should be Included In the Opening Speech,In the view of the QF Committee (Including the Lord President of the Council,who could not be present at our last meeting) the Speech should not promisethe Introduction next Session of more legislation than there may be time tocomplete.    Calculations by the Chief Whip show that there will barely be1
sufficient Parliamentary time for Essential Bills and those Bills -which havefirm places in the programme, so that it would be unsafe to make promisesabout the introduction of second priority Bills.    The fact that a Bill is not mentioned in the Speech does not mean that it could not be introduced, if inthe event Parliamentary time proved available,4.        Colleagues will note that the draft Prorogation Speech assumes thatall the major and contentious Bills still before Parliament will havereceived Royal Assent by the end of the Session.E-lord Chancellor *s Office25 October 19762
