ca6 m*3(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(56) 231COPY NO5th October, 1 956.CABINETTHE SOMALI LAND PROTECTORATE ANDTHE HORN OF africa memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies on 23rd July I circulated to the Cabinet a memorandum(CP.(56) 1B0) in which I made proposals regarding the policy which her Majesty&apos;s Government should follow in regard to the future ofthe Horn of Africa.2.      Owing to the Suez crisis.it has not been possible for theCabinet to consider those proposals.     Meanwhile, developments have occurred which have made relations between the SomalilandProtectorate and Ethiopia even more difficult.     Firstly, the emperor of Ethiopia, on a visit to the Ogaden, made a speech in which herevealed an Ethiopian ambition to secure the inclusion of Somalia(the United Nations Trust Territory under Italian administration which has been promised independence in 1960) with the EthiopianEmpire and which, though it is not clear that he made any directreference to the Protectorate, has not unnaturally given the Somalisof the Protectorate the impression that he would like to see all theSomali areas similarly included.    Secondly, the Ethiopian authoritiesin the Province of Harar have been harassing the tribes from the protectorate grazing in the territories transferred under the 1954Agreement, claiming that they are Ethiopian tribes and seeking tointerfere with the tribal organisation the continuance of which wasguaranteed under that Agreement.    As a result, one tribe from the protectorate has been forced to abandon the good grazing in the territories and to retreat northwards towards the more barren landnearer the Protectorate.3.      As a result of pressure exerted by our Embassy in Addis Ababaon the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and, more recently, plain speakingby the Foreign Secretary and myself to the Ethiopian Foreign Minister,the Vice-Governor of the Harar Province has at last agreed to meet our Liaison Officer in the territories with a view to discussing thedifficulties which have arisen and trying to reach an agreement on alist of the tribes and sub-tribes which can be held to be covered bythe term &quot;tribes from the Protectorate&quot; in the 1954 Agreement.    It isto be hoped that this meeting will result in at any rate some temporaryeasing of the situation.    The local signs are, however, not altogetherfavourable and, if the Ethiopian authorities continue to commit what we regard as breaches of the 1954 Agreement, the Foreign secretary and I will be confronted with very difficult decisions as to our nextstep.     Those decisions will be all the more difficult if we are not by
then clear about the objectives of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs longer-term policy in the Horn of Africa.     Vv e are therefore both agreedthat it is important that the Cabinet should reach early conclusions onthis matter.    On the other hand, we are also agreed that the issues involved require some further analysis in the light of the latest developments both in the area and in the Middle East and Africa asa whole.4.     Accordingly, shortly before his departure for New York,the Foreign Secretary agreed that I should suggest to our colleagues that a Committee of Officials should be set up to consider the proposals in C.F.(56) lcn and any alternative proposals that any of theDepartments concerned may wish to nut forward, to sift the issues involved, and to put forward recommendations for the considerationof Ministers.    I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree that sucha Committee should be set up;  that it should consist of representatives from the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence as well as from theForeign Office and from my Department, with a neutral Chairmannominated by the Prime Minister;  and that it should be asked to regard this task as one of urgency and to submit its report as soonas possible.Colonial Office, S.W.1.5th October, 1956.
