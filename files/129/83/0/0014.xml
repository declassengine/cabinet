CAPITAL punishment memorandum by the Lord Chancellor// cbAt its meeting on 11th July, 1956 (CM.(56) 55th Conclusions, Minute S)Cabinet apnointed a Committee under my Chairmanship to consider andreport on the possibility of framing a Government measure to amend thelaw of murder and to restrict thereby the scope of capital punishment.We have discussed the form such legislation might take and we have considered, in consultation with the Lord President and the Lord privy seal, the advantages and disadvantages of introducing a Government Billon this subject.2.      We think that if legislation were introduced it should be on thelines of the Eill which is being circulated separately (C. F. (56) 215).     Thefirst part of this Bill (which is a preliminary draft) gives effect to the undertakings which the Government gave in the House of Commons on15th February last to amend the law of murder by:-(i)   abolishing the doctrine of constructive malice;(ii)   providing that provocation by words alone may besufficient to reduce murder to manslaughter;(iii)   providing that the survivor of a suicide pact shallbe guilty of manslaughter and not murder.In addition, the Bill introduces into English law the Scottish doctrine ofdiminished responsibility which the Government undertook to considerwithout entering into any definite commitment.3.     The second part of the Bill confines capital puiishment to certain types of murder, i. e. :-(a)   murder in the course of theft;(b) murder by shooting or causing an explosion;(c) murder for the purpose of avoiding arrest orescaping from custody;(d) murder of a constable acting in the execution ofhis duty or of a person assisting him;(e) murder by a prisoner of a member of the staffof a prison acting in the execution of his duty;and* secret.P.(56) 214 , COPY NO._rl-24th September, 1956CABINET
(f)   two or more murders committed on differentoccasions.The Bill does not seek to introduce degrees or categories of murder which distinguish some murders from others on the basis of moral heinousness, but to retain capital punishment for those forms of murder which most clearly strike at the maintenance of law and order and are most likely to be amenable to the deterrent effect of the death penalty.    It is aimed at the professional criminal, the person who carriesa gun, the killer of the agents of law and order, and the rare but dangerousmultiple killers of the type of Christie and Heath.4.     The Bill also includes minor provisions to give effect to some ofthe recommendations of the Royal Commission on the form and executionof the sentence of death and the form of the verdict of guilty but insane.5.      We consider that a Bill on these lines will be a workable middleway between the retention of capital punishment and its total abolition.The Lord Chief Justice and the Lord president  of the Court of session have been consulted on the proposals and have not dissented from them.    There remains the question whether it is politically wise tointroduce a Government Bill at this juncture.    The arguments for and against doing so may be summarised as follows:-Arguments in favour of Government Legislation(1)  The Bill expresses the present state of public opinion which,though not abolitionist, would like to see some amendment of the law toreduce the number of capital sentences and, in particular, to avoid thepassing of the capital sentence in cases where it will clearly not be executed.(2) The Bill is something like what the Government was asked to doby middle opinion in the House of Lords.(3) Legislation will enable the Government to regain the initiative and will satisfy the expectation of the country that the Government willnot be content to stand aside and let the Silverman Bill go through.(4) The Bill is consistent with the Governmenfs stated views onthe need to retain the death penalty for certain forms of murder as an instrument in maintaining law and order.(5) A decision to introduce legislation will enable the government spokesman at the party Conference to accept the resolution advocatinglegislation.(6) There is no doubt that the only alternative to the introductionof a Government Bill is complete abolition, because the Silverman bill will go through under the Parliament Act.(7) If the Silverman Bill is passed unamended, immediate government legislation will be necessary in any event to remove ambiguities anddefects which in a matter of this importance cannot be allowed to remain on the Statute Book.
Arguments against Legislation(1) The Bill will take up a considerable amount of Parliamentary timeand possibility necessitate abandoning one of the Governmenfs major projects, such as House of Lords reform or amendment of the Rent Acts.(2) The attitude of the Conservative abolitionists is doubtful.    Theymay not vote for a Second Reading; they may support an amendment to convert the Bill into an abolition Bill;   if a.Government Bill is passedthey may nevertheless subsequently support the Silverman Bill.(3) The Government may be accused of bad faith if it refusesfacilities for the Silverman Bill and introduces one of its own.(4) To allow the Silverman Bill to go through under the parliament act would create less acerbity and controversy than to introduce aGovernment Bill.5.     The arguments against legislation turn on the difficulty, controversyand possibility bitterness  that it may involve at a time when both the Suezcrisis and the Governmenfs intention to reform the House of Lords andamend the Rent Acts make it desirable to avoid other sources of conflictand, in particular, to avoid charges of ill-faith.     Controversy andexpenditure of time cannot, however, be. altogether avoided because ofthe necessity to amend the Silverman Bill either by the &quot;scheduled&quot; amend-ment procedure described in the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum(CP.(56) 215) or by introducing separate legislation which would have tobe pushed through immediately the Silverman Bill received the royal assent.6.      Charges of breach of faith will no doubt be made whatever we do,short of giving the Silverman Bill facilities for a second passage.    TheCommittee were however impressed by the view that the charge wouldnot be well-founded if, having given the abolitionists a free run last session, we brought forward in all good conscience next session a Billdesigned to give effect to what middle opinion in the country, as reflected in the House of Lords and in some of the amendments put down in the commons, appears to consider right.    It would be understood that,although the Whips were on, Members with a genuine conscientiousobjection to capital punishment would be free to follow their consciences,and the existence of the Whip might make it easier for those Conservativeabolitionists who stop short of conscientious objection to retreat fromthe position which they have taken up.7.      It is desirable that a decision on the question whether government legislation is to be introduced should be taken before the party conference where the Home Secretary will be in some embarrassmentif he can say nothing of the Governments intentions.    If it is decidedto go ahead with legislation the drafting of the Bill can be completed intime for its introduction at the beginning of the session.K.House of Lords, S. W. 1.21st September, 1956.
