-ft e q100LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME:   1956/57 session memorandum by the Lord Privy seal the Queen&apos;s Speech for the Opening of the new Session,which has been circulated as CP.(56) 228, provides a usefulopportunity for the Cabinet to review next Session&apos;s legislative pro-gramme as a whole.    The Speech does not, of course, commit usfinally to including or excluding any particular measure.    Nevertheless,it ought to refer to all the major measures which we contemplateintroducing, and, at the same time, should not include more of those measures than we believe we can pass without undue demands on parliamentary time.2.      The programme outlined in CP&quot;1.(56) 162 has been somewhatamended in subsequent Cabinet discussions.    The list of Bills whichare now candidates for next Session can be classified in four groups,as follows:-Group A.    Bills mentioned in The queen&apos;s Speech(Note.     Bills in square brackets await final Cabinet decision).Admiralty Naval DisciplineAgriculture White Fish SubsidyColonial Gold Coastf&quot;Malaya //&quot;MaltaJ/Fuel and Power f Electricity (Herbert Report)   /Mining SubsidenceHome Office Shops (Closing Hours)Police FayHomicideHousing and Local Govt.

It is particularly difficult to judge whether a programmedrawn from the first three of these four groups will be realistic since it is impossible to foresee how far we may have to find time for theSilverman Bill on its second round (and, if it reaches the Statute Book,for the consequential legislation which will then be urgently necessary)in addition to our own Homicide Bill.    It is also impossible to assessaccurately the time which may be needed for a House of Lords reform bill, and for our own Homicide Bill, especially if the Opposition takeadvantage of the opportunities for obstruction which are inherent inan attempt to pass these two Bills through the House of Commons moreor less simultaneously.    I must, however, emphasise that even ifthese unforeseeable complications are entirely ignored, the list of bills in Group A alone will probably demand more Parliamentary time than is likely to be available.    If account is taken also of Group B,to say nothing of some of the items in Grouo C,the prospect becomeseven worse.    I must emphasise, also, that any programme as heavilyloaded as this will leave us with no time at all in hand to meet theunforeseeable but urgent Bills which always crop up.     Finally, a programme of this order will make heavy demands on the time ofMinisters and on the patience of our own back-benchers.4.      The programme is dominated by four major Bills - Homicide,House of Lords Reform, Rent Restriction, and Customs Duties(Dumping and Subsidies).    If all four of these Bills are to stand in thefinal selection, it is for consideration whether we should omit any reference to certain other, relatively less important, Bills in the queen&apos;s Speech, in order that we may not publicly commit ourselves to more than we may be able to fulfil.    This would not, of course,prejudice the eventual introduction of some, or all, of these Bills,if time proved later to be available.     Possible omissions of this kind
are Naval Discipline, Electricity (Herbert Committee), MiningSubsidence and Cinematograph Film Production.    In addition it maybe possible to defer the Malta Dill until the 1957/58 Session.     Onthis basis, the Bills mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech, together withthe essential Bills in Group B, would constitute a programme which,with reasonable luck, should be just manageable.    But the pressure would remain heavy;  and the Bills in Group C could have no promise that time would be found for them - they would have to take theirchance.R.A.B.Office of the Lord privy Seal, S.W.J. ,5th October, 1956.
