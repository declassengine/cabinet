Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1956CONFIDENTIALCP. (56) 23617th October, 1956CABINETBAGDAD PACT ORGANISATION: PRP7ILEGES AND IMMUNITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs on 31st July, 1952, the Foreign Secretary was asked to give the Cabinet earlynotice of any new proposal to extend immunities and privileges to international agencies (C.C, (52) 75th Conclusions, Minute 6). I now wish to inform mycolleagues that proposals may be laid before them shortly to extend certainprivileges and immunities to the Bagdad Pact organisation.background. The Bagdad Pact was signed by Iraq and Turkey on 24th February, 1955.Since then the United Kingdom, Pakistan and Iran have acceded to it. Inaccordance with Article 6 of the Pact, a ministerial permanent Council has beenestablished, and held its first meeting in Bagdad in November 1955. At thismeeting the Council set up a number of permanent bodies under the Pact, inparticular:  (a) a military committee;(b) an economic committee; and(c) a secretariat to staff these committees and any other bodies which mightbe established.3. The secretariat was originally staffed mainly by Iraqis, with the assistanceof members of the embassies of member countries in Bagdad specially appointed for this purpose. In the ensuing months, however, the work of the organisationexpanded rapidly: committees were created to deal with the problem of Communistsubversion, and both the economic and military committees established a numberof subsidiary bodies. This expansion placed increasing responsibilities on the secretariat. As a result, the Secretary-General asked for and obtained the approvalof the Council for the reorganisation of the secretariat on a fully internationalbasis, with staff to be recruited by the Secretary-General himself and paid for from an international budget.4. The Council&apos;s resolution on this subject provided, in a memorandum of guidance for the Secretary-General, that he should submit a draft budget to governments and should also submit proposals for any privileges and immunitieswhich might be appropriate for the organisation. At the same time, the UnitedStates Government, which is closely associated with the Pact although not a full member of it, joined certain committees and offered to contribute to the secretariatin personnel and finance.Present position. The Secretary-General has recently submitted a draft budget for theapproval of Pact Governments and will shortly be submitting proposals forprivileges and immunities. I intend to make every effort to see that theinternational agreement which, it is assumed, must result from the Secretary-General&apos;s proposals, commits Her Majesty&apos;s Government no further than is strictlynecessary for the purposes of the organisation.  It is, however, in Her Majesty&apos;s50660Copy No. gpj
Governments interest to see that the organisation functions efficiently. my present view is that, since its purposes and activities are most closely comparable to those of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and Western European Union,Her Majesty&apos;s Government should be prepared to accept, as the most generoustreatment to which they could commit themselves, an agreement on the lines ofthe Status Agreements relating to those organisations (Commands 9383 and 9479respectively), with such modifications as may be appropriate. It may, for example,be unnecessary to make provision for permanent representatives and their staffssince such representation is normally carried out by the diplomatic representatives in Bagdad of member countries.6. The total establishment of the secretariat is likely to be fixed at approximately 55 persons, of whom some 10-15 will be United Kingdom nationals.Since the headquarters of the organisation is in Bagdad, and since for political reasons it is unlikely that many meetings will be held in the United Kingdom, theeffect in this country of granting privileges and immunities to the Bagdad Pactorganisation should be very small in practice.recommendation.   I accordingly invite my colleagues :  (a) to take note of the position I have described above; and(b) to authorise me to enter into negotiations with other member governments in the Pact, and with the United States Government, for the purposeof reaching agreement on the privileges and immunities to be accorded to the organisation.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W. I,16th October, 1956.
