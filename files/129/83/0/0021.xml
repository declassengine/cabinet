SECRETt iC.P.(56) 221 COPY NO.  0 J1st October, 1956CABINETEAST/WEST TPADE:  china memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsThe United States Government have made certain proposals (see annex A) to us and the other members of the Consultative Group for restricting the use of the China exceptions procedures until the end ofthe year when the Consultative Group would meet to seek a settlement of differences on the China trade controls.2. I realise that, on the face of it, the United States proposals involvegoing into reverse, at least partially and for a time, as compared with thepolicy approved by my colleagues and announced to the House of commons on 14th May, of making &quot;more use&quot; of the exceptions procedures. the wording of the United States proposals also presents difficulties, differingas we do with the Americans on the &quot;central purpose of the China controls&quot;.3.      More favourable light was, however, thrown on the United states proposals by the U. S. Ambassador who called to see me on 24th September.Mr. Aldrich explained that the essence of the proposals was that we shouldhandle this matter quietly and moderately until December, by which timestudies now being undertaken in Washington by a Committee under mr. Clarence Randall, Chairman of the Council on Economic Policy, wouldhave been completed.    He was sure that a meeting of the ConsultativeGroup in December could be counted on to produce useful results.    TheUnited States was now offering a definite commitment to hold that meetingby a given date and we could be certain that the United States would not come forward again with the same unsatisfactory proposals which they had put to us last May.     Furthermore, the United States Presidential Electionswould be over by December;  and, finally, Mr. Randall, who was reviewingthis matter, had a reputation for action.    Mr. Aldrich stressed that thequestion of the China trade controls was a very serious matter politicallyin the United States.    The United Kingdom attitude in this interim period was very important.    He referred in particular to the overriding of UnitedStates objections by the United Kingdom in the recent case of tractors and land-rovers for China, and expressed the view that if further cases ofthis kind occurred other members of the Co-ordinating Committee of the paris Group would follow the British lead and a breakdown in the Chinacontrols would ensue.4.      My colleagues will, I imagine, agree with me in thinking that theUnited States proposals require to be considered not only with an eye onthe difficulties we have at home on this subject but also against the wider international background.
5.      Because of the Suez crisis and the fact that we have decided to appeal to the Americans for help if we have to buy dollar oil, it is essential in my view that we should try to avoid creating new points of friction, andthat we should proceed with caution, particularly until the United Stateselections are over, in a field of such political importance for the UnitedStates Government.    I suggest therefore that we should consider whether we ought not in our own wider interests to go some way to meet the UnitedStates proposals.6.     As a contribution to our discussion of this matter, I circulate at annex B for my colleagues&apos; comments a counter draft for transmission tothe United States Government.    This would not tie our hands so drasticallyas the United States proposals, but we should be showing some willingness to prevent a complete breakdown of the controls before the ConsultativeGroup had even discussed the substance of the matter, which is what I suppose the Americans are really after.7.      My draft is in technical language.    In practical terms we should besaying that for this purely interim period and if other members of the consultative Group agreed likewise:-(l)    we should not be putting forward further cases like thetractors and land-rovers (items &quot;peeled off&quot; theSoviet lists in 1954) unless there are absolutelyunavoidable domestic reasons;(2)    we should not neek to impose our view that &quot;minimum&quot;shipments can include shipments which are only&quot;minimum&quot; in the strategic sense, a view which i am advised is highly contentious;  and(3)    we would do anything we can (even if it is not much) to restrict the flow of the simple exceptional casesinvolving no prior consultation.8.      If strong objection is seen to pinning ourselves down by a detailedcommunication of the kind I have suggested, an alternative might be forme to offer the U.S. Ambassador a verbal and more general assurance that we would go more slowly until the December meeting of the consultative Group in our use of the exceptions procedures, particularly for &quot;peeled off&quot; items.    This would mean that we should have to put atemporary brake on, as there is no doubt that we have been making veryliberal use of the exceptions procedures in recent months.     I cannot, ofcourse, predict whether the Americans would be content to leave it atthis but they might.9.      My own preference is for the second course.S. L.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.1st October, 1956.
CHINA TRADE CONTROLS:   UNITED STATESPROPOSALSi-Toposed interim course of action with respect to China tradecontrols.A. Participating countries Agreement:(1)    to be discriminating in their use of the exceptionsprocedures so as to avoid vitiating the central purpose ofthe multilateral China controls pending a definitivediscussion of the problem;(2) to permit only limited quantities of document 782items to be shipped and these to be judged on a case-by-case basis;   and(3) to have regard to the contribution which the item maymake to the military strength of Communist China inaccordance with a strict interpretation of the CHINCOMexceptions procedures.B. United States Agreement (provided all other participating countries agree to the proposed interim arrangement outlined above):(l) to participate in Consultative Group meeting by end of year to seek definitive settlement of differences between united States and other Participating Countries on problem;(2)  not to object to exceptions cases meeting the standardsoutlined above.In fulfilling the latter commitment the United States as a general rule would refrain from raising objections to document 782 cases unless there is clear evidence that the standards listed above are not being met.Cases under other exceptions procedures would be considered on their merits and in accordance with existing criteria.ANNEX BASSURANCES ON UNITED KINGDOM EXPORTSTO CHINAWhile maintaining their view that their use of the China exceptionsprocedures has been in accordance with CHINCOM rules and procedures,Her Majesty*s Government are willing until the end of the year or until a meeting of the Consultative Group, whichever is earlier:-
(l) to refrain from invoking the Doc. 471 procedure for exports to China unless strong reasons ofpublic policy make this unavoidable;(2) to refrain from invoking the CH 450 minimumshipments procedure except for exports of a low monetary value;(3) to impose such restraint as they can on the rateof licensing exports under the Doc. 782 procedure.The above assurances are given without prejudice to proposals which her Majesty&apos;s Government may put forward at a meeting of the consultative Group, which they understand the United States Govern-ment are willing to see convened before the end of the year for thepurpose of seeking a definitive settlement of the differences between theUnited States and other participating countries on the scope of the china controls.    These assurances are, of course, conditional on other members of the Consultative Group agreeing to take similar action.2-
Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1956SECRETC.P. (56) 2224th October, 1956CABINETNUCLEAR RADIATIONS: PUBLIC control memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh AffairsParagraph 102 of the Statement on Defence, 1956, alluded to the severerestrictions on movement put of doors that the radio-active fall-put frpm ground-burst nuclear weappns wpuld entail, and paragraph 104 went on to promise that special attention would be given to informing the public both about the effects ofthefmo-nuclear attack and of the measures that can be taken to counter them.2. A pamphlet giving the facts about nuclear weapons was placed on salein January; a popular version intended for the man-in-the-street is in preparation.But so far we have published little or nothing of our plans and pfopbsajs for measures to counter the radio-active effects of nuclear weapons. Both the Secretaryof State for Scotland and I believe that our provisional proposals for control ofthe public under fall-out conditions should now be published. These proposals are contained &quot;iij the attached Memorandum, and I invite authority to issue it.3. Briefly, the scheme outlined in the Memorandum provides for the controlof the public by the division pf the contaminated area into zones, called for convenience, W, X, Y and Z, the boundaries of which would be determined inrelation to the intensity of contamination as measured on the ground. The basicinformation would come from Royal Observer Corps posts and be supplementedas necessary by the local civil defence organisation. Zone Z would be the most highly contaminated zone, and there wpuld be no alternative to removing everyonewithin it; this movement would be planned to start after 48 hours had elapsedfrom the time of burst. In Zones X and Y, the emphasis would be on peoplestaying where they were, but, if they were not to become sick, restrictions on thetime they could spend out of doors after an initial period of 48 hours in refugeaccommodation would be inevitable. Thus in Zone Y they would be restricted to 2 hours per&quot; day in the open for the next 12 days and 4 hours for the rest ofthe first month; in Zone X to 4 hours per day for 5 days only; while in Zone Wthey would be freed of all restraint within 48 hours.4. The scheme outlined in the Memorandum has emerged from discussions and studies among the Departments and Services affected and its broad outlinesare already becoming known as a result of courses at the Civil Defence Staff college and elsewhere. What is now required is to go a stage further and make the schememore widely available especially among local and other authorities and the civil defence services. The conceptions embodied in the Memorandum are new andmight excite some public interest; but this can easily be over estimated. Neitherthe publication of &quot; Nuclear Weapons &quot; nor, in a different field, the recent Armyexercise &quot; Try-out &quot; produced any significant public reaction. The fact is that the likely extent of the area that might be contaminated by a ground-burst megatonweapon and the degree of persistence of radio-activity have made very little impact on the general public. The implications of the immobility imposed by fall-out and the resulting strain on people, especially in households providing billets forevacuees, are not appreciated; nor ai&quot;e the cumulative doses of radio-activity whichwould be inevitable for large sections of the population, even assuming complianceCopy No.  51
