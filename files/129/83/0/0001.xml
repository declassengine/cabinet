MALTANote by the Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for the colonies attach a note on the latest developments in Malta, following upon the dispute over the week-end about the use of landing facilities in Maltese waters for flying boats evacuating civilian families from the suez contractors base.Li.Colonial Office, S.W.1.13th August, 1956.COPY NO.  I&apos;?-1)iCABINETMALTAPending receipt of further information it appears that thedispute involving the air-lift of civilian families from the SuezContractors&apos; base has been solved.     It is not yet known if theRediffusion services have been restored.     The Governor has been askedfor a further report and an appreciation of the situation.2.        Meanwhile, it appears from Mr. Mintoffs public statementsas reported in the Press that the following issues are outstanding.I.   Consultation over Suez3.        Under the present Maltese Constitution, defence and foreignaffairs are reserved to the Maltese Imperial Government, i. e. therepresentatives of Her Majesty*s Government.    There is no absoluteright of the Maltese Government to be consulted about defence measures,but they are frequently consulted at least on defence measures whichhave a bearing on their domestic concerns.    When it became apparent that Malta was being used extensively for current troop movements andother measures, special discretion was given to the Governor to consultand inform Mr. Mintoff as appropriate.     Consultation about the flying -boats was, however, taking place in any case, under long-standing routinearrangements between the R.A.F. and the Maltese police, untilinterrupted by Mr. Mintoff.secret.P. (56) 20114th August, 1956.
p04.        It appears, however from his public speech that Mr. Mintoffis laying claim to be consulted in a much wider sense.     The &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reports him as saying that &quot;Malta would have to be consulted before she would enter into a war&quot;.5.        Whilst Mr. Mintoff is no doubt justified in his concern aboutMalta&apos;s interests in the possible outcome of the current Suez crisis,it was hardly envisaged by the Round Table Conference that consultationwith the Maltese Government would involve them having a veto on her majesty&apos;s Governments decisions in the reserved field of defence andforeign affairs.II.   Economic difficulties(a) Economic Commission6.        Mr. Mintoff also apparently referred publicly to failure sofar to reach agreement with Her Majestyrc3 Government on the proposedEconomic Commission to investigate the dispute about Malta&apos;s financesand the level of United Kingdom assistance.    Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentfirst proposed terms of reference to the Maltese Government on 11th July,but these were not accepted and negotiations have been proceeding since then.    The Maltese Government have also requested appointment of a one-man Commission instead of the two-man Commission proposed by her Majesty&apos;s Government.    The Secretary of State wrote to theChancellor of the Exchequer on 4th August proposing that, in view of the urgency and other factors, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should agreeto the draft terms of reference preferred by the Maltese government but should insist on the two-man Commission chosen by them and notthe Maltese Government.    It is understood that the Chancellor foreseesconsiderable difficulties in accepting the terms of reference proposed.(b) Financial Crisis7.        Meanwhile, Mr. Mintoff has claimed that cash available tomeet expenditure under his interim budget is running out and hasdemanded immediate payment of the whole of the  5 millionsrepresenting assistance from all sources which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are prepared, pending the results of the economic commission, to grant for the current financial year.0.        Normally, financial assistance is only issued in instalmentsfrom time to time during the financial year against accounts ofexpenditure and estimates of need.     These are not forthcoming fromthe Maltese Government, and there is the danger that the MalteseGovernments request is designed to and would, if granted, prejudice the total level of aid to be finally agreed.     (Expenditure has been already running at a rate proportionately in excess of a level of 5 millions for the whole year).9.        Provided that a cash need can be established by the maltese government arising from reasonable expenditure on approved services,there would be no objection to making part of the total  5 millionsoffered available now.    If, in addition, the question of the economic commission can be settled without further delay, it should be possibleto deal with the financial crisis by following established financialprocedures.
10.      A subsidiary issue is Mr. Mintoffs attempt to secure complete control of the Rediffusion services.     The Governor previously-expressed concern about Mr. Mintoffs attempts to restrict freedomof information through the Press and broadcasting, and his violent actionin cutting off the services is a reflection of his attitude in these matters.It will be recalled that he threatened to take similar action to prevent a broadcast by the Archbis&quot;hop of Malta during the referendum campaignlast February.IV. Points for Decision11.       The immediate points for decision appear to be as follows:-(i)    Should Mintoff be more fully informed about currentmilitary moves in the Mediterranean, and in particular,consulted about policy issues in Her Majesty&apos;governments dispute with Egypt?(ii)    Can the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals concerninga decision on the Economic Commission be approved and if Mr. Mintoff raises further objections, canHer Majesty&apos;s Government accept his proposal for a one-man Commission consisting of Sir George Schuster?(iii)    What reply should be given to Mr. Mintoffs request for immediate payment of   5 millions?(iv)   What further measures, if any, are necessary toensure that the Colonial Office and the Governorare kept more promptly and fully informed of defence measures affecting Malta?V. Future Implications12.      Mr. Mintoff has apparently challenged Her Majesty*sGovernment to make up its mind about its policy towards Malta, at thesame time renewing his threat to abandon integration in favour of independence.     This is another proof of his determination to secureintegration on his own terms and this latest incident is no doubt partof a campaign timed to produce maximum results owing to the positionover Suez.13.      Even if the issues discussed above are resolved, it is clearthat further crises will arise or be manufactured in the near future, i. e.over economic &quot;equivalence&quot;.     The probable result of resisting the challenge would be Mr. Mintoffs resignation,  suspension of theConstitution, and possibly some disorder which would have to bequelled by United Kingdom troops in Malta.14.      Whether or not the challenge should be met depends on  -(a) Mr. Mintoffs next moves;(b) the extent to which the co-operation of the maltese government is militarily required in the currentSuez crisis;(c) Ministers&apos; assessment of the political and prestigeelements involved in a Maltese crisis (resulting fromMr. Mintoffs resignation) at the present juncture.
