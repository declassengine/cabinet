Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1956SECRET Copy No.  /J. QCP. (56) 24824th October, 1956CABINETBROADCASTING: THE FORTNIGHT RULEMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal the recommendations of the Select Committee on Broadcasting (anticipation of Debates) are appended.2. My view is that we should go as far as possible towards accepting therecommendations of the Select Committee and I think we can agree to them allwith the exceptions and provisions below.Budget Broadcasts3. The recommendation in paragraph 10 that the rule should in future applyto Budget broadcasts should be rejected. I understand that the Chancellor of theExchequer considers that the arrangements should continue as hitherto. Thegrounds for rejecting this recommendation would be:  (a) They are a long-established institution and of great value as a means of informing the public.(b) If they were delayed until the completion of the debate on the budgetresolutions they would have little value.(c) The debate in the House has already started by the time they are delivered.(d) As both the Government and Opposition have broadcasts, they areimmediately and patently balanced politically, and the broadcasting authorities are not responsible for the arrangements.Ministerial Broadcasts4. The Report makes no reference to the application of the ruleto &quot; Ministerial broadcasts.&quot; These are to be distinguished from party political broadcasts and certain other broadcasts made by Ministers. They are thenon-controversial broadcasts made by a Minister on a matter concerning his official responsibilities and are defined as &quot; purely factual or explanatory oflegislation or administrative policies approved by Parliament or in the nature of appeals to the nation to co-operate in national policies which require the active participation of the public.1&apos; 1 consider the rule should not apply to thesebroadcasts even though they were the cause of the rule being created. TheGovernment should, however, give an assurance that Ministerial broadcasts wouldnot normally be made on subjects which were for the time being barred to theB.B.C. or I.T.A. except when in the Governmenfs estimation the national interestso required. For example, if Parliament were to be recalled to discuss an issue(which would inevitably be one of great national importance) the Prime minister would obviously have to be free to broadcast to the nation upon it. Any right of reply that might be conceded to the Opposition should also be exempt.Provision for Relaxing the Rule5. The Committee recommends, in paragraphs 11 and 12 of the Report, thatsome flexibility should be allowed for in the application of the restriction, at the50677 b
2discretion of the Postmaster-General; it suggests that a small committee or panelshould be appointed by the House to be available to advise the Postmaster-general in connection with any application for relaxation.,  &apos;  Alternative Courses(a). The Postmaster-General, whose function it would be to make and administer the rule, considers that, whenever an exception to the rule is sought, he should be advised by the small committee or panel. In thisway any permitted breach of the rule would have all-Party support.(b) Or perhaps the arrangements might take the following form:  That the B.B.C. or I.T.A. should inform the Postmaster-Generalof any item in any business statement to which they consider the rule should not apply. Then either (i) the Postmaster-General would agreeat once; or (ii) if he felt unable to do this the matter should be automatically referred to the panel for advice. This reference to the panel would be dependent on notice to the Postmaster-General beingmade, say 36 hours before the broadcast, otherwise the Postmaster-Generai&apos;s disinclination to agree would have to be final. I considerthat this proposal would have the merit that it would be for the broadcasting authorities to take the initiative in setting the machinery in motion; if they fear that the Postmaster-General might, in effect, edittheir broadcasts, they need not apply for exemptions. I would hopethat in practice the panel would only occasionally be invoked and thatthey would meet informally and give speedy decisions; no doubt the panel itself would work out a suitable modus operandi to provide forfunctioning when not all of the panel were available at short notice.(c) Or the recommendation that the Postmaster-General should have discretion to relax the rule should be rejected on the grounds that the B.B.C.would resent any interference in their interpretation of it.In any case there is advantage in bringing the House into the management of the rule, especially if it is accepted that the basis for the existence of the rule is &quot; the necessity of upholding the primacy of Parliament.&quot; The committee orpanel might suitably be nominated by Mr. Speaker, if he is willing so to do.Other Points6.   I would direct attention also to the following points :  (i) Party political broadcasts which hitherto have been exempt, would infuture be subject to the rule (recommendation in paragraph 10).(ii) In elucidation of the recommendation in paragraph 7, the rule would apply,subject to any relaxation agreed to by the Postmaster-General, to all- business announced in any Statement on the business of the House ofCommons, whether the weekly business statement, any supplementarybusiness statement, or even the very occasional statement made outsidethe House. Such a generic term in the business statement as &quot; private members&apos; Motions &quot; would, of course, comprehend all the items of thatdescription down for the day. The rule would on this basis not applyto the following business, because it is not announced in businessStatements:-(a) Opposed Private Bills.(b) Prayers for the annulment of orders and regulations.; (c) Adjournment debates under S.O.9. (These are usually matters of primary importance, but as the notice of debate is only one of afew hours, the importance of the rule in their case would not be great.)(d) The half-hour adjournment debates at the end of each sitting.The omission of these items of business from the purview of the rule may seem illogical, but this is a price worth paying for the certaintyand simplicity attained by basing the application of the rule upon thebusiness statements.
Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S.W.1,22nd October, 1956.50677(hi) The rule should apply to all broadcasts &quot; transmitted &quot; by the broadcasting authorities and, not as hitherto, only to those &quot; arranged&quot; by them.(One of the incongruities cited in the evidence was that the rule did. notapply to, say, the broadcast of a debate by the Oxford Union.) If suchbroadcasts can properly be regarded as news reporting they would notbe caught by the rule, and this should be made clear. Otherwise, the broadcasting authorities should be told informally that their responsibility with regard to broadcasts which they do not &quot; arrange,&quot;would not be regarded as going further than taking the same care to seethe rule was not transgressed as they would to see that in other respectssuch broadcasts were properly conducted. (No doubt if, in the case ofany such broadcast arranged by them, their standards of propriety andseemliness were offended, they would have their means of redress,possibly the withholding of any future invitations.)(iv) The recommendation in paragraph 8 that the rule should only apply toBills during the seven-day period preceding the Second Reading will,of course, have the effect of excluding from the rule the committee stage of Bills, which in some cases involve important debates on particular issues (e.g., the debates at the Committee stage of theCapital Punishment Bill). There is no recommendation as to whetherBills should be subject at the Second Reading stages to the rule in bothHouses. I think we should make it clear that the rule should only apply in the House in which Bills are first introduced.(v) The Select Committee could not deal with the. question whether the rule should in the future as in the past apply to the House of Lords. Asfar as I am aware the Lords have not pronounced upon the matter.Logically there are the same reasons for preventing anticipation in the lords as in the Commons. Parliament consists of two Houses, andthe main justification for any rule is to uphold &quot; the primacy ofParliament.&quot; As there is no weekly business statement in the House ofLords, the rule would need to apply to business announced as down onthe Order Paper for a specified day.7. The Postmaster-General has ascertained the views of the broadcasting authorities on the recommendations. The I.T.A. broadly welcomes the Reportthough with some cautionary comments; the B.B.C. is less forthcoming. TheI.T.A. welcomes the Postmaster-General&apos;s proposed power of relaxation and theuse of an advisory panel, though it assumes that the initiative would lie with the broadcasting authorities; the B.B.C. fears that the taking of day-to-day decisions by the Postmaster-General &quot; would so seriously affect the position of the Governorsthat it is difficult to see how they could bear this responsibility.&quot; Both authoritieshope the rule will continue to apply only to &quot; issues &quot; and that the Lords would be excluded. The B.B.C. say that if the Budget broadcasts are caught by the rulethey may wish to abandon them completely rather than take them later; the I.T.A.(who have never yet relayed any of them) considers they should be so caught.8. Hitherto the Government and Opposition have taken care to agree uponthe action to be taken in connection with the rule. So far as I have been able toascertain, the Opposition^ attitude now is that the scope of the rule should benarrowed, if not extinguished, and I think that these proposals will be broadly acceptable to them.9. We shall be expected to make our views known in answer to parliamentary questions already on the Order Paper and I therefore seek the views of mycolleagues upon the proposals in this memorandum.R. A.

APPENDIXSELECT COMMITTEE ON BROADCASTINGREPORTThe Select Committee appointed to consider whether any changes are desirable &apos;.in the present methods of giving effect to the principle that there should be somelimitation to the Anticipation of Parliamentary Debates by Broadcasting; have considered the matter to them referred and have, agreed to the following Recport:  1. Your Committee have held ten: sittings, and have examined twentywitnesses, including Members of Her Majesty&apos;s Government and Opposition, and representatives of the British Broadcasting Corporation and of. the independent television Authority.2. The Order by which Your Committee were set up clearly asserts the :principle that there should be some; limitation upon the anticipation ofParliamentary debates by broadcasting in; sound or television, and the terms ofreference must therefore be construed accordingly. Your Committee are, however,of the opinion, for the reasons givem in. the following paragraphs, that any restrictions should be reduced to the smallest extent that is practicable.3. The history of the matter and the origin of.the so-called &quot; Fourteen DayRule &quot; are conveniently given in the first memorandum submitted by the british broadcasting Corporation. Various reasons have from time to time been givenfor the limitation upon anticipation, notably the possibility of unfair influence by ministers or advocates of pending measures, and the danger of undue pressure from outside on individual Members. Your Committee have reached the conclusion,after considering all the relevant arguments, that the only justification which canbe claimed for any policy of limitation at the present day is the necessity ofupholding the primacy of Parliament in debating the affairs of the nation.4. Further, in view of the advent of competition in the field of television,where particular concern has been expressed on this subject, and the likelihood of a rapid increase in the number of alternative programmes, Your Committee aredoubtful whether even this ground of objection can be regarded as providinganything more than a temporary justification for a special rule not applicable toother organs of publicity. Indeed, Your Committee recognise that the developmentof radio and television in Britain and the broadcast discussion of public affairs which has followed it have done much to encourage an intelligent interest in thework of Parliament.5. Your Committee have considered the possibility of an arrangement underwhich the extent of the limitation, as well as its administration, should be left tothe organisations concerned. The British Broadcasting Corporation appears todesire this, but the Independent Television Authority expressed a clear preference if there has to be any limitation for a definite rule of guidance to be laid down byParliament.6. Your Committee have no doubt that the view of the independent television Authority is the sounder of the two and recommend that theGovernment should take the responsibility of laying down and enforcing any restriction which Parliament may deem necessary.7. After careful consideration, Your Committee recommend that in futureany limitation upon anticipation should apply only from the time of theannouncement of business, and that the limitation should not begin to operate untilseven days before the business in question is to be taken.8. Your Committee have also considered that part of the present rule which applies the prohibition to all legislation pending in the current session, and aresatisfied that this limitation is unnecessary and undesirable. Your committee recommend that no rule other than that already proposed should apply to any legislation, and that, in the case of a Bill that has passed, its Second: Reading, no restriction should apply at all.
9. Your Committee recommend that Members should be treated in exactly the same way as other persons in the administration of any restriction uponbroadcasting in sound or television. The British Broadcasting Corporationsuggested that the restriction should be confined to Members, but Your Committeecan see no justification for any such differentiation.10. The regular series of party political broadcasts and the annual Budgetbroadcasts provide a separate and special source of anticipation, which appears tohave caused some uncertainty and confusion in the past. The question is a difficult one, upon which the general public is no doubt entitled to have its viewstaken fully into account, but as a matter of principle Your Committee find itimpossible to justify the treatment of these broadcasts on a different basis fromany Others. As regards the Budget broadcasts the deferment of these until the debate on the resolutions has been concluded might well be found in practice to bemore convenient and agreeable to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theOpposition representative.11. Your Committee recommend that the proposed restriction should be embodied in a prescription issued by Her Majesty&apos;s Postmaster-General. your committee are, however, strongly of the opinion, after hearing evidence on thepoint, that some flexibility should be allowed for in the application of the restriction,and therefore recommend that the prescription should be so drafted as to allow for relaxation at the discretion of Her Majesty&apos;s Postmaster-General in individualinstances.12. Your Committee further recommend the appointment by the House, atany rate for an experimental period, of a small committee or panel of Members,who would be available to advise Her Majesty&apos;s Postmaster-General in connectionwith any application for relaxation.13. Your Committee recommend that the prescription to be issued by her majesty&apos;s Postmaster-General should not apply to any overseas broadcasts.14. Representations were received by Your Committee to the effect that pressure had been brought to bear on the British Broadcasting Corporation by government and Opposition Whips or by Party organisations with the result thatcertain Members had been unfairly or improperly excluded from certain regularprogrammes. Your Committee decided that it was proper to investigate theseallegations, in so far as they might disclose the existence of additional and irregularlimitations upon the anticipation of Parliamentary debates, and accordingly heardevidence from the British Broadcasting Corporation, from the Whips of the three main Parties and from representatives of the Party organisations, as well as fromone of the Members concerned.- 15. Your Committee are satisfied that the British Broadcasting Corporationhas not been subjected to any improper pressure and can safely be relied on todefend itself from political interference. Your Committee are also satisfied that the pressure exerted by the Whips was directed only towards ensuring a reasonable balance of political views, which the Corporation agrees to be a difficult problem.The action of the Party organisations appears to them to have been confined to making comments of a similar nature, which the Corporation regarded as quiteunobjectionable. On this subject Your Committee have only two comments tomake:  (i) Your Committee believe that suspicions may have been needlessly arousedby the atmosphere of secrecy which surrounded these discussions; andthat these suspicions would be largely removed if the considerationsgoverning the selection of speakers on political subjects were more generally known,(ii) Your Committee believe that the effort to obtain strict impartiality hasresulted in certain cases in somewhat narrow decisions, notably in caseswhere Members have been invited to undertake wholly non-political broadcasts.17 th May, 1956.
