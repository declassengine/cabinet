DEFECTS IN THE DEATH PENALTY (ABOLITION) BILL,Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for Welsh Affairs and theSecretary of State for scotland,       The Death Penalty (Abolition) Bill, if it became an Act in itspresent form, would be defective in the following particular s:-(i)  Scotland.   It is doubtful what the penalty, if any, for murderwould be in Scotland.   The first part of clause 1(1) abolishes the death penalty for murder, and the second part provides that every enactmentrequiring a court to pronounce or record a sentence of death in anycase of murder shall be construed as requiring the court to sentencethe offender to imprisonment for life.   In Scotland the penalty of deathfor murder rests not on any enactment but on the common law;   and while the Bill abolishes the death penalty in Scotland it is arguable thatno other penalty is substituted.   Alternatively, the courts might holdthat it was within their discretion to impose any penalty other thandeath;  or even that the Bill was not operative in Scotland.(ii)  Courts-Martial.   It is doubtful whether or not the Billapplies to courts-martial sitting overseas.   The promoters said thatit was intended to apply to all courts-martial and expressed the viewthat it did so apply, but this is not certain.If the promoters are wrong and the Bill applies to courts-martial only in Great Britain there is an anomaly in relation tocourts-martial sitting in Northern Ireland.   Northern Ireland is expressly excluded from the scope of the Bill and courts-martial heldthere would be able to sentence to death for murder committed overseasor in naval ships and establishments, although courts-martial in GreatBritain would not.In either event the issue is of such importance that it oughtto be clear on the face of the Bill whether it applies to courts-martialoverseas or not.R Copy NO. ^0SECRETCP.(56) 21824th September, 1956CABINET
(iii)   Visiting Force Courts-Martial.    Section 2(4) of the visiting forces Act, 1952, read with section 17(1), provides that the sentence of death passed by a visiting force court-martial shall not be carriedout in the United Kingdom unless under the law of the United kingdom or any part thereof a sentence of death could have been passed in asimilar case.   If the death penalty for murder is abolished in GreatBritain but not in Northern Ireland it will not be clear whethersentences of death for murder passed by visiting force courts-martialcan or cannot be carried out in Great Britain, and it is desirable thatit should be made clear that they cannot2.       These defects are serious and would have to be correctedeither by an amendment of the Bill itself or by immediate subsequentad hoc legislation.   During the progress of the Bill in its second session the House of Commons may, under the Parliament Act,suggest amendments without inserting them in the Bill (&quot;scheduled&quot;amendments), and if these are agreed to by the House of Lords theyare inserted in the Bill as presented for the Royal Assent.   amendments proposed by the House of Lords in the second session and agreed to bythe House of Commons are similarly inserted.G. LL.-G,J. S.*        *24th September, 1956
