(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)9* mm mm mm m     mm mm mm m m *w *m     -mm *.&apos; secret.P.(56) 24620th October,, 1956CABINET\ RENT RESTRICTION:  SCOTLAND\Memorandum by the Lord chancellor on 8th October the Cabinet appointed a Committee of Ministers under my Chairmanship to consider how best the proposed legislation to amend the rent Restriction Acts might apply to Scotland, and to report to the Cabinet(CM. (56) 69th Conclusions, Minute 5).2.      The Secretary of State for Scotland had felt difficulty in altering the controlled rents in Scotland at the present time for two reasons:-(i)    Because the Valuation and Rating (Scotland) Act, 1956will require the tenant to pay all owners&apos; rates fromI May, 1957 with a corresponding reduction in rents,j Repeated undertakings have been given that this( change will not affect the tenant&apos;s total burden andan increase in rents accompanying those in England andWales,though made for quite different reasons,could be regarded as a breach of faith.(ii)    There is no basis at present or until 1961 in scotland for a change in the rent structure comparable tothat proposed for England and Wales.3.      Nevertheless, we have agreed that it is not politically possible forScotland to take no action in line with England and Wales;  the pressure forsome relief to Scottish landlords would become too severe.     Furthermore,it is imperative to encourage more private investment in house building inScotland where the need is very great.4.      We therefore endorse the following proposals:-(a) There should be an interim increase of 2 5 per cent in controlledrents where the requirements of the 1954 Repairs and Rents legislation are met, except for the expenditure test:  that is to say, the house must be in good repair and not unfit for human habitation in any other respect butthere had been no need to spend the specified amount on repairs over the specified period.(b) The 40 per cent increase permitted under the 1954 Act should beraised to 50 per cent where the expenditure test as well as the other requirements has been met.     This will be equivalent in fact to an increaseof 80 to 85 per cent in the average rents as reduced in May, 1957 by theamount of owners&apos; rates and would therefore not fall far short of what isto be permitted for England and Wales.COPY NO.
(c)    A certain sector - still to be determined - of the higher valuedhouses should be decontrolled.    If possible this would reduce the upper limit of rateable value to  40 as in the Metropolitan Police District,although the Secretary of State for Scotland would prefer the limit to be 45.5.      There are some sources of possible embarrassment to the Ministerof Housing in the fact that the expenditure test is to be retained in scotland in view of past undertakings that it would be the tenant&apos;s safeguard againstexploitation, whereas under the new proposed legislation for England andWales the test would no longer be applicable.     It may also be difficult toavoid some prominence being given to the fact that, whereas the applica-tion of the conditions of the Repairs and Rent legislation in Scotland willdisqualify from rent increase houses classified as unfit for human habitationthis will not be the case in England and Wales.    In the view of the Ministerof Housing, many slum houses will have to remain inhabited for fifteen years or more and it is therefore in the interests of the tenant that the landlord should be encouraged to keep the house in the best possiblerepair (allowing for its basic structural defects) by the prospect ofobtaining a rent increase if he does.6.      It will be the aim of the Secretary of State and the Minister of housing to avoid embarrassment to each other in pursuit of theirdifferent policies.    If pressure is applied for greater uniformity betweenScotland and England and Wales it can well be argued that there arealways inevitable differences between the countries and that the increases proposed for Scotland are merely temporary ones until the new valuationswhich will operate in 1961 make parallel action more possible.7.      We accordingly invite our colleagues to agree the following varia-tions in the application to Scotland of the proposed Rent Bill:-(i)The present repairs increases of 40 per cent of therecoverable rent in 1954 under the Housing repairs and Rents (Scotland) Act, 1954 should be raised to50 per cent.(ii)An interim increase of 25 per cent of the 1954recoverable rent in cases where the expendituretest has not been satisfied, but the house is other-wise fit for human habitation and in good repair.(Hi)A slice of the higher valued houses - whose extentis still to be determined - to be freed from rent control.K.House of Lords, S. W. 1.19th October, 1956.
