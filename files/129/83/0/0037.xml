If an attempt is to be madeto conclude the talks, officials need further instructions.2. It seems that, if this is acceptable to us, the Unions would agree to a &quot;package deal&quot; comprising the following, but would notwillingly accept less than this:-(1)       Long-term assurances both for the guarantees on individual commodities and for the guarantees in total, comprising:(a) an undertaking that the guarantees on individual commodities would be maintained each year ata percentage of their levels in the preceding year,with provision for review of these percentagesafter, say, four years;  officials have reportedthat for all review commodities agreement shouldbe possible at a uniform 96 per cent of the figure for the previous year, subject to reductions beinglimited to a total of 9 per cent over any threeyears;  the alternative would be 95 per cent witha 12 per cent limitation on reductions over three years; and(b) an undertaking that the total value of the guaranteeswould be maintained each year at not less than the sumof:(i)   97 per cent of the preceding year&apos;s level, and(ii)  the cost increases, if any, that had occurred since the last annual review.(2)       No alteration in the form of the annual reviews, at which all relevant factors would continue to be considered;  but the dropping of special reviews (on the assumption that cropprice guarantees, like price guarantees for livestock products, would be determined at each annual review for the immediately following year and not for the subsequent one).
(3)       A scheme of grants, mainly to owner/occupiers andother land-owners, for capital improvements that would lead to increasing efficiency;  this might involveexpenditure from public funds, according to the rateof grant and the items included of anything from 50 millions to  70 millions over ten years.3. We have already agreed to long-term assurances on theindividual commodities   (CM.(56) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 3).4. A general assurance in addition to the assurance on individual commodities seems to be necessary for any arrangements that would appear satisfactory politically or to farming opiniongenerally.     The form now suggested for this is a compromise which takes account of the Unions&apos; understandable desire to have an assurance that has regard to cost increases.     We are satisfied thatany undertaking without such provision would be too negative to appeal to the farmers.5. We do not think these arrangements for minimum obligations.   upon the Government will in practice limit our freedom to make changesin the value of the guarantees to any greater extent than would thecircumstances that we should in any event have to consider;  we are bound at any annual review,for instance, to have to consider the effects of cost increases as well as the trend of net income and other factors.6. We are disappointed that it has not been found acceptable tothe farmers, or practicable, to introduce any new arrangements that would circumscribe the opportunities for pressure that arise atannual reviews and that the restrictions proposed are unilateral.The Farmers&apos; Unions have made it quite clear that any arrangementthat does not allow all relevant factors to be taken into account atannual reviews would be unacceptable to them.    In any case, thealternative of devising a formula to control the determinations that should be made at annual reviews, or to limit the holding of such reviews,has proved impracticable owing to the complexities and difficulties thatarise from the many factors that really need to be taken into account and from the fact that the basic material is not sufficiently accurateto support a rigid formula.    The imposition of an upper limit to theincrease of guarantees at annual reviews as the converse of theproposed lower limit would not in  practice be of real value to theGovernment or reduce materially the scope for bargaining.7. A scheme of capital grants for fixed equipment on farmshas been worked out by officials, on the basis of the Cabinet decisionon 24th July, 1956, for discussion with representatives of land-owners and farmers as part of the &quot;package deal&quot; with the farmers1 unions.Grants would only be paid in respect of holdings that are, or will bewhen improved, economic.    Subject to this test, they would be payable for individual improvements and not restricted to comprehensiveschemes as under the Livestock Rearing Acts.    Grants would notbe payable in respect of. farmhouses and cottages.8. Over the next ten years, if current levels of investmentare maintained, expenditure on fixed equipment might amount to 250 millions.    Of this total  90 millions would representimprovements already grant-aided under the Livestock Rearing Actsand other legislation, grants towards this expenditure amounting to-2
about  40 millions;    80 millions would represent expenditure onfarmhouses and cottages;   the balance &quot;of&apos;&apos; 80 millions would representexpenditure&apos;on the forms of fixed equipment that the scheme of grantswould be designed to encourage.9. A decision must be reached as to the rate of grant before talks with the landowners and farmers can begin.    The alternatives are:-(a) a flat rate of 33^per cent:  this might, over 10 years,involve ah expenditure of  50 millions on grants andraise total investment from  250 millions to 320 millions:(b) a differential grant of 33jrper cent on the first 10 expenditure per acre of the holding and 50 per centgrant on expenditure in excess of that amount:  this might over 10 years, involve an expenditure of 65 millions on grants and raise total investmentfrom  250 millions to  340 millions.A flat rate grant would be straightforward to administer.    The&quot;differential grant is designed to give extra help and incentive to those whosefarms are in need of more extensive re-equipment, comparable with the comprehensive schemes under the Livestock Rearing Acts.     This scheme should give an added incentive to the owner of the economic smallholdingas the need for fixed equipment on small farms is relatively greater thanon large ones and such farms generally have greater arrears of re-equipment to overtake.     The Ministry of Agriculture do not expect anyadministrative difficulty in operating a scheme of differential grants.10. Buildings on horticultural holdings comparable with those thatwould be assisted on ordinary farms would qualify for grant;   grants wouldnot be paid in respect of glasshouses, Dutch lights and frames.    But adecision is needed whether other specialist horticultural equipment - heatinginstallations for glasshouses, etc. and fixed equipment for refrigerated and gas stores - should be assisted.     On the one hand it could be argued thatsuch equipment is to be regarded as part of a commercial undertaking andthat such undertakings should not receive special assistance, particularly at a time when the industry generally has just lost the benefit of investmentallowances.     Greater efficiency in horticulture will not affect the levelof agricultural guarantees.     Against this, it will be argued that horticultureis part of agriculture and should not be excluded from measures designedto foster efficient production.     Political considerations must be takeninto account in reaching a decision.11. We ask the Cabinet to decide -(i)     whether officials should be authorised to make an offer to the Farmers&apos; Unions of long-term assurances on the comprehensive basis of the proposals set out in para-graph 2 above:(ii)     whether the guarantees on individual commodities shouldbe 96 per cent or 95 per cent of the levels for the previous year (with corresponding restrictions upon reductionover a three-year period):
it 9 9(iii)     what the rate of grant should be on capital improve-ments on farms:(iv)     whether grants should be available for specialisedhorticultural equipment.H. M.D.H.A.16th October, 1956.
