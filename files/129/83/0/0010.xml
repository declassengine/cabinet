Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1956SECRETCP. (56) 21020th September, 1956CABINETTHE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONNote by the Lord chancellor at their meeting on 12th June, the Cabinet appointed a Committee under my chairmanship to consider what practical proposals for increasing the efficiency ofthe railways could with advantage be included in a White Paper on lines suggested by the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation (CM. (56)41st Conclusions, Minute 2).2. The British Transport Commission are responsible for the management of the railways and my Committee consider it important that any plan for increasing the efficiency of the railways should bear the stamp of the Commission^initiative and authorship. This view is fully shared by the Chairman of theCommission. My Committee therefore recommend that the White Paper shouldbe in two parts; the one containing the Commission^ own proposals and the other the Governments conclusions on them.3. I am asking the Minister of Transport to circulate separately thememorandum which the Commission have prepared. This document, whilereviewing the financial situation of the Commission^ undertaking as a whole,concentrates on the railways, describing their vital role in the nation&apos;s transport system and the Commission^ programmes for refashioning equipment and practiceso as to assure their future profitability. The memorandum is necessarily long and detailed and few of my colleagues may be able to undertake the considerable labour of reading it. Those who are, however, able to look through it will, I think, agreethat the Commission have produced a creditable and readable document whichmeets many of the criticisms now aimed at them. Its frank and informativeexposition of their position and prospects and the detail of the future programmes should, moreover, help to dispose of the suggestion that an independent inquiry isnecessary to establish the facts about the railways.4. The main conclusion of the Commission^ memorandum is that, whilsttheir ultimate position will be one of considerable strength, the benefits from their proposals will accrue only on the long term and that during the next five or six years they will continue to incur substantial deficits which they will be unable to finance under existing arrangements. The Minister of Transport and the FinancialSecretary to the Treasury have in consultation with the Commission prepared ascheme for the provision for a limited period of facilities for special loans whichthe Commission should ultimately be in a position to repay.5. I am circulating with this note a draft of the Governmenfs part of theproposed White Paper which my Committee have agreed, subject to any minordrafting amendments which may prove desirable and to the settlement of the precise wording in which the points in paragraph 27 should be presented. this draft describes in its final paragraphs the Governmenfs conclusions and theirCopy No.50540
proposals for dealing with the situation. These proposals appear to be about thebest that can be devised without exposing the Government to the criticism thatthey are commending a subsidy. Their introduction will require legislation: butit is now clear that early legislation in some form will be necessary because theCommission^ powers to borrow to cover their current deficits are inadequate.6. The draft White Paper also describes, as background to the financial proposals, the extent to which the Commission^ current difficulties are not of theirown making and what the Government has already done to improve theCommission^ structure and give them the kind of organisation that will enablethem to survive in present-day conditions of competition. The draft, while notcommitting the Government to the actual scale of investment indicated by theCommission for future years, expresses the Governments approval of the general lines of the Commission^ proposals. This measure of support seems necessary ifthe Government are to justify the exceptional financial measures proposed.7. The authority of my colleagues is now sought to the publication of this white Paper, including the Transport Commission^ memorandum in the form ofan annex, before the end of the present session of Parliament and to the drafting of the necessary short Bill with a view to its introduction early in the new session.If these proposals are acceptable to my colleagues, I suggest that the Government^intentions to introduce this legislation could appropriately be made known in theGracious Speech on the opening of the new Parliament.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1,20th September, 1956.
DRAFTTHEBRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONSECRET
THE BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONRevised Draft of the White PaperIntroduction1. In a statement to the House of Commons on 19th March, 1956,*referring to an application made to him by the British Transport Commissionon 21st February for his approval to a general increase in freight charges,the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation made it plain that, as an essential part of the decisions then taken by the Government and the Commission, areassessment of the economic and financial future of the Commission would beundertaken during the ensuing six months.2. In pursuance of that arrangement the Commission, in reviewing theirpresent and future operations, have prepared and submitted to the government comprehensive statement, which is annexed, describing in considerable detail their policy and plans for the future including a re-examinationof the whole scope of the reorganisation, modernisation and re-equipment ofthe railways. The statement also sets out with full financial and statisticalbackground their forecast, based on their operating experience and commercial judgment, of the financial results they expect to achieve if those plans areimplemented in accordance with the proposed programme.3. Although their forecast indicates substantial deficits for some years,the Commission have, in the Governments view, presented a convincing caseshowing that, by such measures as the acceleration of the schedule for the modernisation and rationalisation of the railways, the use of greater freedom in charging policy and the steady development of greater productivity, theyshould be able to overcome their present financial difficulties, reaching astate of current balance by 1961 or 1962 and eventually a position ofconsiderable strength. The assumptions on which the Commission^ estimates are based and which are carefully explained in the statement are important for a proper appreciation of the position and a full understanding of the forecasts. It is clear that the Commission have spared no effort to lay beforethe nation as full and detailed an explanation of their position, proposals andassessment of the future as is possible.4. This Paper gives the Governments conclusions on the matter and their proposals for enabling the Commission to assure their future.The Role and Structure of the British Transport commission. The annual turnover of the British Transport Commission is 700 million and they are the largest single employer of labour in the country,employing some 800,000 men and women.6. The Commission have not and never have had a complete monopoly of the traffics for which their services are provided. They are in keencompetition with public and private transport by road, sea and air. TheGovernment have fully recognised this fact in the changes that they havemade in the structure of the Commission since 1951.* See Official Report House of Commons, 19th March, 1956, Columns 829 and 830.
7. By means of the Transport Act, 1953/the Government, whilst providingfOr the partial &quot;reversion of the road haulage industry to private ownership and for the removal of restrictions on the carriage of goods by privatehauliers, deliberately reshaped the Commission^ undertaking and releasedthem from a number of out-of-date obligations so as to enable them to meetcompetition. The railways in particular were strengthened in competition bydecentralised management and by a greater freedom to adopt normal commercial practice and policy.8. By the Transport (Disposal of Road Haulage Property) Act, 1956,the Government enabled the Commission to retain more vehicles than was permitted under the 1953 Act-particularly their long-distance trunk network.9. By these Acts the Government have, in their view, established theright framework for this great industry. The direction of British Railwayshas been decentralised to six Area Boards consisting of men of outstandingability and experience. London Transport remains under the london transport Executive, and the remaining parts of the Commission^ undertakingare organised as separate divisions of the Coriimission, each With its ownManagement.10. For their parti the Commission early in 1955 published their plan for the Modernisation and Re-equipment of British Railways, and theGovernment announced their support for it as a courageous and imaginativeplan to give this country a modern and efficient railway system.11. The setting up in 1955 of the British Railways Productivity council was a recognition by all concerned that the successful operation of theCommission^ undertaking and its prosperity are dependent in a high degreeon the efficiency and Willing co-operation Of every member of the staff. Itis an important factor in any consideration Of the Commission^ position that two-thirds of their total expenditure is accounted for by wages and salaries.12. To-day the British Transport Comihissidn much more resemble in organisation, purpose and status a large-scale commercial corporation. TheGovernment are satisfied that this kind of structure is the right one for aconcern which must be competitive in the services that it gives to the nation and in the charges that it makes for them. It is a structure on which, asthe Commission^ own plan shows, their profitable future can be assuredonce the legacy of the past has been Overcome.The Present Position13. The Commission have to a large extent inherited the position inwhich they find themselves. For thirty years the railways have been unableto Undertake any large schemes of modernisation or, indeed, to keep iip anadequate programme of replacement. In the early 193Q&apos;s the railways, like other industries, suffered frOm the depression, and in the subsequent yearsup to the war they were riot in&apos; ai position, owing to the conditions in whichthey were operating and the challenge of road transport, to raise large sUrrisof new capital; moreover, the advantages of electric and diesel traction werenot then so great or so apparent,- nor was technical Opinion On, and experienceof, the different systems so far advanced or so clear. During the war itwas impossible to provide resources for the maintenance of the railwaysexcept to the very miriirriUni needed to keep them running, arid at the sametime they were subjected to the iricreased strain iriiposed by heavy wartraffic and by war-time conditions of operation; they, therefore, emerged from the war with&apos; much- of their equipment out-of-date and all of it run3!*50540 . b 2
i down, j. Since the war, successive Governments have been forced seriouslyto restrict investment in the railways because of other urgent claims on thenational resources.14. Although it is intended that this past lack of investment should be remedied by the carrying out of the Modernisation Plan, the railways will inthe meantime continue to suffer many of the disabilities of poor equipmentwhile, at the same time, their services are subject to widespread competition.This limits the extent to which the Commission can impose higher chargeswithout driving away profitable traffic.15. The extra revenue to be derived from increased railway chargesdoes not grow in proportion with those increases and is confined in thelong run to what the traffic will bear; indeed, the higher it is proposed toraise charges the greater is the proportionate reduction in additional revenue for which allowance must be made on account of traffic to which the fullincrease, cannot be applied. Any sound commercial policy must have full regard to this fact. For example, in February 1956, when in the circum-stances then existing and in view of their statutory duty to pay their waythe Commission sought as far as practicable to cover their increased costsfrom increased revenue, they came forward with proposals which included the right to increase freight charges generally by 10 per cent. In theory,if they had been able to apply an increase of 15 per cent, to all railway freight traffic without losing any, the additional yield from that source would havebeen  55 million a year. This sum, if it could have been realised, wouldwith the Commission^ other proposals have been more than sufficient tobridge the gap; but, in practice, after making allowance for traffic to whichthe full increase could not have been applied without driving it away, the yield would have been so much less that they would still have been left with a substantial deficit. In these circumstances the Commission decidedthat the sound commercial course was to restrict the increase thencontemplated to 10 per cent, although this proposal, if it had been implemented along with the Commission^ other proposals for increased charges, would still have left them with a deficit running at that time at separately of about  18 million a year.16. It is thus evident that increases in charges would not, of themselves,offer a satisfactory or lasting solution of the Commission^ dilemma.Moreover, it remains the Governments view that every effort to avoidcontinued cycles of price increases in the basic industries is essential to break the spiral of inflation; any general increase in railway charges should,therefore, if at all possible, be avoided.The Government&apos;s Conclusions and Proposals17. The national interest requires that the future of the railways shouldbe assured. As carriers of passengers over long distances and of suburbanpassengers in large numbers to and from work and as carriers of bulk freightthe railways are essential and will continue to be so for as long as can before seen.18. In Appendix B to their statement, the Commission have indicated the level of investment expenditure which they expect to incur over the period to 1962 in accordance with their modernisation plan for the railways. TheCommission^ view, which the Government share, is that the rate of investment for the railways in 1957 should be increased substantially ascompared with previous years, to about  120 million. There would underthe plan be further increases in later years. It is not possible to pre-determinemany  years  ahead  precisely  the  level  and  nature of  the  investment
expenditure: this will need to be reviewed from time to time in the lightof economic conditions, the availability of supplies and the experience gainedas the plan develops. The Government are, however, satisfied that thegeneral shape of the Commission^ investment proposals is sound, and thatthe Commission^ forecasts of their requirements are reasonable.19. The Government accept the Commission^ plans as practical and necessary and, although they must not be taken as subscribing to all theviews expressed by the Commission, consider that the Commission have nowclearly shown that they can, within a reasonable time, overcome pasthandicaps and provide, the country with a modern and up-to-date transport system which will pay its way.20. It will however inevitably take time to overtake decades of under-investment and to achieve the planned revolution of the railway system.The immediate problem, therefore, is to find a satisfactory basis for theCommission^ finances in the intervening period. As is indicated by what has already been said, two alternatives face the Commission. One is to carrysubstantial though diminishing annual deficits until 1961 or 1962; the otheris to place on the heavy bulk traffics substantial additional charges which,even if they could be imposed without driving further traffic off the railways,would be a serious addition to industrial costs. For this reason theGovernment consider that it would be against the broad national interestto adopt the second alternative; they also accept the Commission^ view thatin the long run it would be unsound commercially.21. This does not mean, of course, that the Commission will not imposeselective increases in their charges during the next 5 or 6 years. If they areto overcome their present financial difficulties, it is vital that they should beable to take advantage of the freedom which the Government have given themto vary their charges in accordance with sound commercial principles and to relate their freight charges more closely to costs. Equally it is theGovernments view that the Commission^ passenger services should be runat reasonably remunerative rates wherever possible; this may well involveadjustments in fares in certain areas from time to time.22. It is hoped that general increases in either freight charges or fares maybe avoided; but the Government wish to make it plain that they would not expect the Commission to continue to hold this position in the face of factorssuch as a further large increase in costs which was not accompanied by corresponding improvements in efficiency and output.23. The probable financial position of the Commission for a number ofyears ahead is summarised in Chapter VII of the Commission^ statement.They forecast substantial deficits for several years and do not expect thatthe benefits of modernisation and of the other remedial measures proposedwill achieve a balance on their revenue account until 1961 or 1962. TheCommission lack adequate powers to raise the funds necessary to coverthese deficits and have urged the Government to adopt a financial plan which,while it avoids subsidy, will place their organisation on a firm and sound basis during the critical years of reconstruction. They expressly request that any relief temporarily accorded to them in relation to their immediateobligations should be strictly limited in time and amount.24. The Government consider that on the basis of the Commission^proposals there are good prospects that the railways will in due course be ablenot only to pay their way but also to earn an adequate surplus. In their view it would be sound financially to provide the Commission with the furtherfinance they require to achieve this.result.
25. The Government therefore propose that for a specified mirabei^ afc?years, broadly until the revenue account of the Commission . is expected to&quot;be in balance, special advances should be made to the Commission out ofthe Consolidated Fund equivalent to their revenue deficits in these years butlimited as to total amount which may be of the order of  250 million. these advances would be repayable by instalments beginning after a specified period; they would be liable to interest but for a certain time the commission would be entitled to receive additional special advances to cover payments ofthat interest. The power to obtain these advances would be in addition to theCommission^ existing borrowing powers. During the period of the specialadvances the Commission would be authorised to charge to a special account in their books, for subsequent amortisation over a period of years, the netdeficits of the railways and interest on the advances.26. The Government have also had regard to the burden imposed on theCommission^ revenues in respect of interest payable on sums required to finance the railway modernisation plan while capital expenditure is in progress and has not begun to yield benefits. There is ample precedent in similar circumstances for permitting undertakings, both public and private, tocapitalise payments of such interest and to raise additional money to meet them. It is proposed, therefore, that the Commission should be empoweredto borrow, within their borrowing limits already authorised by Parliament,to cover the first three years&apos; interest on sums required for capital expenditureon the railways. The Commission would be authorised to charge these payments of interest to a special account for subsequent amortisation.27. In paragraph 101 of the Commission^ statement their revenueposition is forecast at three major points of time on a basis which makes provision for charging interest in full on borrowings to finance capitalexpenditure but excludes any liability for interest on sums required to coverdeficits. Under the Governments proposals, however, the Commission wouldnot be relieved of any liability in respect of their deficits accumulated to31st December, 1955, although they would be allowed to capitalise for alimited period interest on subsequent deficits. The Commission would alsobe allowed to capitalise for a limited period their payments of interest onborrowings for capital expenditure on the railways. The Commission estimate that, if effect were given to the Governments proposals, the rate of annualdeficit as at December, 1956, as shown in the Table in paragraph 101 oftheir statement, would be increased from  42 million to about  45 million.There would, however, be some improvement on their estimate of the positionas at 1961 or 1962. The annual rate of surplus available by 1970 to meetrepayments of advances would be reduced from  50 million to about 35 million.28. The Governments proposals outlined in paragraphs 25 and 26 willrequire legislative sanction, and it is intended that a Bill for this purposeshall be introduced in due course.
