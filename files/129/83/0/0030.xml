(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETS&apos;3C.F.(56) 230COPY NO.5th October, 1956CABINETREDISTRIBUTION OF seats memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and Minister for /Velsh Affairs and theSecretary of State for scotland on 22nd September, 1955, the Cabinet authorised the HomeSecretary to consult the Leaders of the Opposition Parties on thesubstance of proposals relating to the redistribution of seats.(C.M.(55) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 3).    Appendix I is a copy of theproposals as submitted to the Opposition Leaders along with an explanatory note (Appendix ll).2.      The proposals are designed to meet certain criticisms of theHouse of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act, 1949, which weremade on both sides of the House during the debates on the boundary commissions&apos; report in December, 1954 and January, 1955.    they provide for:(1) Lengthening the intervals between general reviews of constituencies (as suggested in paragraph 19 of theReport of the English Boundary Commission).It is proposed that the interval should be not lessthan ten or more than fifteen years - instead of notless than three or more than seven years under thepresent law.(2)    Requiring the Boundary Commissions to take accountof the inconvenience and breaking of local tiesattendant on constituency changes;   and for this purposerelieving them of the obligation to give full effect tothe present redistribution rules in all circumstances.(3)    Amending the definition of electoral quota, to providefor a separate electoral quota for each country inthe United Kingdom.(4)    Giving the Commissions guidance about the cases inwhich they should hold local inquiries.3..    &quot;points arising from the replies from Mr. Clement Davies andMr. Gaitskell (Appendices III and IV) are referred to in thefollowing paragraphs.
i ti 15Whether provision should be made for dealing with anomaliesbetween general reviews4.      Mr. Clement Davies suggested that it might be necessary todeal specially with certain constituencies where the electorate had become, say, in five or six years wholly disproportionate as comparedwith the general average.    Mr. Gaitskell suggested more specificallythat if the electorate of a constituency rises above 80,000 or fallsbelow 40,000 an &quot;interested authority&quot; or not less than 100 electorsshould be entitled to require the Commission to consider adjustments.We have already told Mr. Clement Davies that the Commissionswould not be precluded from recommending a major alteration in an exceptional case;  though we felt that a minimum period of ten years between general reviews should normally be short enough to ensurethat gross discrepancies in electorates were not allowed to continue for too long.    This, we think, should also be the answer toMr. Gaitskell.    His present proposal seems quite unacceptable.There are constituencies in Wales and Scotland of which the electoratemust necessarily remain below 40,00^;   and, in any event, precisearithmetical directions have not worked in practice.Whether the basic number of constituencies in Great britain should be increased from 613 to 6255.      The Opposition say this proposal is consequential on the government&apos;s proposed amendment of the electoral quota (seeparagraph 2 (3) above).     This is misconceived;  under our proposals the total number of constituencies in Great Britain at the time ofthe next review is likely to be the same as now - 618.Whether the Rules should be so amended as to avoid the present generaldisparity between county and borough constituencies6.      If the Opposition mean that the Rules should require the electorate in county and borough constituencies to be similar their proposal seems quite unacceptable.   They have, of course, maintainedboth in 1948 - when they created seventeen new borough constituencies -and in 1954 that the English Boundary Commissions recommendationsunduly favoured county constituencies; though Mr. Chuter Ede, in the debates on the 1954 recommendations, conceded that there should be some weighting for rural constituencies, suggesting that its extentwas a matter for consideration before amending legislation was intro-duced.   In our view, however, the weighting cannot be defined in theRules, but must be left to the good sense of the Commissions.Whether the present constitution of the Boundary Commissions shouldbe altered7.      The Labour Opposition propose that -(a) The Chairmen of the various Commissions should be HighCourt Judges appointed by the Lord Chancellor;(b) Two other members of each Commission (not Members ofParliament) should be nominated respectively by thePrime Minister and the Leader of the Ooposition; and(c) The Registrars-General and the Director-General ofOrdnance Survey should serve as assessors and not as members.
ii.     As regards (a), our colleagues will recall that the Speaker waspersuaded with some difficulty to agree that he should continue toserve as Chairman of the Commissions. (CM.(56) 3rd Conclusions,Minute 12).    We still think this is the best course.   In Scotland the deputy (i.e. the acting) Chairman is already a Judge of the Court of session and it might go some way to meet the Oppositions point if theEnglish and Welsh Commissions were similarly given a judicial deputy chairman.9.      We strongly disagree also with proposal (b).   The question ofpolitical representation was considered by the Vivian Committee of 1942,on whose recommendations the present constitution of the boundary commission is based and whose members included Members ofParliament and Party agents of all the main Parties.   The Committeepointed out that, anart from the difficulty of maintaining a fair balance ofpolitical opinion, political members would find, it impossible to divestthemselves of their Party allegiance, with the result that there would befrequent deadlocks or majority decisions which would go far to deprive the Commissions&apos; recommendations of any inherent validity orauthority.   We feel that these objections are still valid.10, We see no objection, however, to proposal (c).11. It is, of course, of the highest importance that any amending legislation on redistribution of seats should, be based on the fullestagreement between the Parties.   If our colleagues agree with the viewswe have expressed above, they may feel that the best way of making progress would be to arrange for discussions with the opposition leaders in order to see how far the gap between our prooosals and theirscan be narrowed.G, LI. -G,J.S.5th October, 1956
APPENDIX IHOUSE OF COMMONS (REDISTRIBUTION OF SEATS) ACT, 1949Proposals for insertion in amending bill.Subsection (2) of section two of the House of Commons(Redistribution of Seats) Act,  1949 shall cease to have effect; and afterthe passing of this Act a Boundary Commission^ reports under sub-section (1) of that section shall be submitted not less than ten or morethan fifteen years from the date of the submission of the Commission^last report under the subsection.It shall not be the duty of a Boundary Commission, in discharging their functions under section two of the 1949 Act, to aim at giving full effect in all circumstances to the redistribution rules, but to take account,so far as they reasonably can, of the inconveniences attendant onalterations of constituencies other than alterations made for the purposesof rule 4, and of any local ties which would be broken by such alterations;and references in that section to giving effect to the redistribution rulesshall be construed accordingly.C.For rule 7 of the redistribution rules there shall be substituted -&quot;7.    In the application of these rules to each of the several partsof the United Kingdom for which there is a Boundary Commission -(a) the expression &quot;electoral quota&apos;  means a number obtained by dividing the electorate for that part of the UnitedKingdom by the number of constituencies in it existingon the enumeration date;(b) the expression  &quot;electorate1 means -(i) in relation to a constituency, the number of persons whose names appear on the register of Barliamentaryelectors in force on the enumeration date under the representation of the People Acts for the constituency;(ii) in relation to the part of the United Kingdom, theaggregate electorate as hereinbefore defined of allthe constituencies therein;(c) the expression  &quot;enumeration date&apos; means, in relation toany report of the Boundary Commission under this Act,the date on which the notice with respect of that report is published in accordance with section two of thisAct. &quot;
D.(1) Where a Boundary Commission revise any proposedrecommendations after publishing a notice of them under paragraph 3of Fart III of the First Schedule to the 1949 Act, the Commission may ifthey see fit comply again with that paragraph in relation to the revisedrecommendations, as if no earlier notice had been published.(Z) A Boundary Commission shall not make a recommendation for the alteration of any constituencies without exercising their power under paragraph 4 of the said Fart III to cause a local inquiry to be heldin respect of the constituencies, unless either -(a) the recommendation is the same as, or in the opinion of theCommission does not materially differ from, a proposedrecommendation of which notice was published under thesaid paragraph 3, and the Boundary Commission received norepresentations objecting to the proposed recommendationfrom an interested authority or from a body of electorsnumbering one hundred or more; or(b) the Commission, after considering the differences (if any)between the recommendation and any proposed recommendationof which notice was so published, and the nature of any representations received about any such proposedrecommendation, and the other circumstances, are of opinionthat the local inquiry would serve no useful purpose.(3) In the last foregoing subsection, &quot;interested authority&quot; and&quot;elector&quot; respectively mean, in relation to any proposed recommendation,a local authority whose area is wholly or partly comprised in the constituencies affected by the recommendation, and a   arliamentaryelector for any of these constituencies; and for this purpose &quot;localauthority&quot; means the council of any county, or any borough (including a metropolitan borough) or of any urban or rural district (in scotland the council of any county or burgh or district).
APPENDIX IIEXPLANATORY NOTE ONR EDISTR ID UT ION O F SEAT S1.      In the debates in December 1954 and January 1955 there appearedto be general agreement with the suggestion made by the boundary commission for England in paragraph 19 of their First Beriodical Report(Cmd. 9311) that the interval between general reviews of constituenciesshould be lengthened.It is thought that a suitable minimum interval would be ten years.This would be long enough to ensure a reasonable period of stability;it would mean that at least two more general elections would take place before the next general review. On the other hand it should be shortenough to ensure that gross discrepancies between electorates of constituencies were not allowed to continue uncorrected for too long.A maximum interval of fifteen years is suggested.   This would mean a gar* of five years between the minimum and maximum intervals, whichwould give the Commissions room to choose a suitable date in relation tothe probable lifetime of a Parliament for undertaking a review.The first of the annexed draft amendments to the 1949 Act wouldgive effect to this proposal.2.      There also appeared to be general agreement with the suggestion made by the Boundary Commission for England in paragraph 20 of theirreport that they should be given more discretion to refrain fromrecommending alterations.Section 2(1) of the 1949 Act has the effect of requiring the commissions to aim at giving full effect to the rules in the second schedule on the occasion of each general review.   This means, among other things, that they are obliged in many instances to recommendchanges which would produce greater mathematical equality betweenconstituencies even though the electorates of the existing constituenciesconcerned are not abnormal.It is thought that the best remedy would be to relieve the commissions of the obligation to give full effect to the rules, and tobring in a presumption against making changes unless there is a very strong case for them.   The second of the annexed amendments would do this, in particular by requiring the Commissions to take account of theinconveniences attendant on alterations and of local ties.   The exception for alterations made for the purposes of Rule 4 would, however, ensurethat full effect would continue to be given, so far as practicable, to therequirements of that rule about conformity between constituency and localgovernment boundaries; and the Commissions would still be able torecommend adjustments of constituency boundaries to conform with the altered ward and other local boundaries not mentioned in Rule 4, since these adjustments would neither be inconvenient nor would they be likelyto involve breaking local ties.
*fl if? ^t   Hi) I3.      It is thought that the two changes mentioned above - extending the interval between general reviews, and bringing in a presumption againstmaking changes unless there is a very strong case for them - should suffice to correct the major defects which experience has revealed in theworking of the 1949 Act.   There is, however, a defect in the rules in theSecond Schedule which also needs attention.   Rule 7 defines the electoral quota as meaning the average electorate of all constituencies in GreatBritain.   It is not possible for the Commissions to use this quota as thebasis of redistribution, because to do so would produce resultsinconsistent with Rule 1, which makes a fixed allocation of seats to scotland and Wales (and consequentially to England) which is not in proportion to their respective aggregate electorates.   It is thought thatthis should be put right by providing for a separate electoral quota foreach country.   The third annexed amendment would do this.4.      It seems desirable to give the Commissions further guidance aboutthe cas-js in which they should hold local inquiries under paragraph 4 ofPart III of the First Schedule to the 1949 Act.   The fourth annexedamendment is designed to do this.Faragraph 3 of Fart III of the First Schedule requires a Commissionto publish their proposed recommendations and to consider representations.A Commission may think that representations could be met by revisingtheir proposals. If so, it seems desirable that the revised proposals should be published to give an opportunity for further representations.The first part of the amendment would authorise this.If the revised proposals are objected to, or if the Commissiondo not propose to revise a proposal which was objected to on firstpublication, it is thought that a local inquiry should be obligatory beforethe recommendation is made in the Commissions report, unless theCommission think that a local inquiry would serve no useful purpose.   Thesecond part of the amendment provides accordingly.   To be effective forthis purpose an objection would have to be made by a local authority or byat least 100 electors.It seems right that a Commission should retain some discretion as to whether a local inquiry should be held or not; but the general effectof the amendment would be that there would be a prima facie obligation tohold an inquiry before any change was recommended to which an objection had been made.
APPENDIX IIICOMMENTS FROM MR. CLEMENT DA VIES2nd May, 1956Dear Gwilym,I have now had an opportunity of considering your letter of20th April and the enclosures.I agree with your proposals.   I have always taken the view thatto chop and change was bad.   The amendments you are also proposingshould remove many of the difficulties which were mentioned in theHouse during the Debates on the Boundary Commissions last general review.There is one matter which I think I should mention and that isthat of course during a period of ten years there are certain to be verygreat changes, particularly owing to the increase there is in the electorate.   I notice that the numbers have increased between 1945 and1 955 by just over 2 million.  It may be, therefore, necessary to dealspecially with certain constituencies where the electorate has become,say in five or six years, wholly disporportionate as compared with thegeneral average.Ever yours,Clem.The Rt. Hon. Gwilym Lloyd-George, M.P.
APPENDIX IVCOMMENTS FROM MR. GAITSKELLHOUSE OF COMMONS (REDISTRIBUTION OF SEATS) ACT 1949Oppositions comments on Governmenfs proposals1.      We accept proposal &quot;A&quot; subject to an arrangement to deal withanomalies arising during the period of ten to fifteen years.We suggest that if the electorate of a constituency rises above80,000 or falls below 40,000 an &quot;interested authority&quot; (Governmentproposal last sub-section) or not less than 100 electors shall be entitledto require the Commission to proceed under paragraphs 3 and 4 ofF&apos;art III of the First Schedule.2.      We accept proposals &quot;13&quot;, &quot;G&quot; and &quot;D&quot;, subject to the following additional provisions -(a) Rule 1 of the Second Schedule:   substitute 625 for 613.   Thisappears necessary in view of the Government proposal under&quot;C&quot;.(b) Rule 5 of the Second Schedule to be so amended as to avoid thepresent general disparity between County and Boroughconstituencies.3.       We hold strongly that the present constitution of the commission has in practice proved unsatisfactory.   We recommend that Part I of theFirst Schedule be re-cast.   The Chairman should not be the Speaker, butin each case a person of judicial experience, distinction and completeimpartiality.   We suggest for the purpose High Court Judges in Englandand in &quot;Wales and persons of similar judicial standing in Scotland andNorthern Ireland:   these appointments could be made by the -LordChancellor.   We think that the realities of the situation would be bestrecognised by giving two other members of each Commission who shouldbe nominated respectively by the Prime Minister and by the Leader of theOpposition and who should not be Members of Parliament and we sorecommend.   Each Commission should be entitled to arrange for the attendance of the appropriate Registrar General of Births, Deaths andMarriages and of the Director General of Ordnance Survey, who would sitas assessors and without a vote.
