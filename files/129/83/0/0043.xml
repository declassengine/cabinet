P,P.(56) 2h52ifth October, 1956CABINETNUCLEAR TOiPONS TESTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs and the Minister of DefenceFollowing the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 20th July (C.M.(56) 51stConclusions, Minute 6), officials of the Departments concerned have studied the possibility of an international agreement for limiting testsof nuclear weapons.     As a result, we wish to put the following views before our colleagues.2.        There is undoubtedly growing pressure in this country and else-where for abolishing all tests a? nuclear weapons.     However much this pressure may be based on loose thinking or ignorance, it is very real andis an important factor in international and domestic affairs.     TheGovernment have firmly stated that they are not prepared in the present world situation to discuss the abolition of nuclear tests in isolationfrom a comprehensive disarmament scheme but we have recently said that,although we think that the question of the regulation and limitation of tests is most appropriate for discussion in the context of disarmament and in the United Nations Disarmament Commission and Sub-Committee, weare prepared to consider other means of discussing the matter if no progress is made in the preferred context.3.        The main factors to be considered are the requirements of our-selves and the United States for tests for the further development of nuclear weapons and the dangers to health, as expressed by the Committeeof the Medical Research Council in this country and by the United StatesAcademy of Sciences.2)..        The dangers to health recorded in the recent report by theMedical Research Council Conmittee are that continued testing at the same rate as over the last few years would produce external radiation whoseindividual and genetic effects would be insignificant (paragraph 280) andby the following statements (paragraphs 282 and 283) regarding internalradiation from ingested fission products:-&quot;282.    In this country, measurements on human bones ofthe radiostrontium content, derived from the nuclear explosionsthat have already occurred, show that the irradiation from this source is now reaching about one thousandth of the maximum permissible occupational level;   and calculation of the fall-out likely, to come, if the present rate of firing continues,suggests that this level may be1 increased ten-fold in thecourse of Several decades ...&quot;283.   In the light of knowledge at present available, weshould feel that inmediate consideration were required if the concentration in human bones showed signs cf rising greatlybeyond one hundredth of that corresponding to the maximum permissible occupational level.&quot;-1-- J-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of...........................TOP SECRET Copy No..hhj...
More recently a special panel of the Medical Research council has amplified this statement in the light of further information.     their conclusions are:-(a) The best estimate that we can make with the data and knowledge available at this present time is&apos; that, ifthe present rate of firing continues, the level ofone hundredth of the maximum permissible occupationallevel may be reached within 20 years.(b) Tf the world total cf nuclear explosions was reduced to15 megatons annually, there would be little delay inthe time taken to accumulate one hundredth of themaximum permissible occupational level;   but that ifthe world total were reduced to approximately half(i.e. about 9 megatons), the delay would be substantial and it was even conceivable that, because of otherconcomitant factors, the level in question might not be exceeded or even reached.5.        The important thing about fission products is the fissionelement in test explosions, the fusion element being from this point ofview irrelevant.     Our officials have therefore studied the fissionelement in nuclear test explosions since they began, for these testsresult in the fission products whose effect has been discussed by theCommittee of the Medical Research Council.     The worldwide fall-out offission products began to be significant in 1952.     Since then, therehave been about 70 megatons cf fission explosions over a period of about four years.     This is a rate of about 17 z megatons a year.     At a rateof 9-12 megatons any risk to health might be completely avoided andwould certainly be deferred for a long time.6,        Our own need for tests in developing nuclear weapons mightjust be met by an average rate of 3 megatons of fission a year providedthat we could accumulate the allocation over 2 or 3 years, since wewould not wish to carry out tests every year.     A rate of 5 megatons offission a year would be regarded as fully adequate.The United States would almost certainly wish to carry outtests on a greater scale than the United Kingdom needs to do.     The viewsof the United States authorities on limitation will, moreover, undoubtedly be influenced by a statement made by Admiral Strauss on 19th July that united States tests in the recent series had &quot;demonstrated that real progress has been made with respect to .. * the achievement of maximumeffect in the immediate areas of a target with minimum widespread fall-out hazards&quot;.     The American administration may claim that United Statestests of thermo-nuclear weapons in future are likely to be less of ageneral hazard than past ones.     Admiral Strauss also mentioned with.M. Ambassador on 1st August that it was now possible to conduct testswhich could not be detected and that his conclusion was that any proposalfor limitation by megatonnage was not practicable and was bound to workto the benefit of the Communist powers.7. It would appear, therefore, that, although for health reasonswe might wish to restrict the world total to 9 or 12 megatons of firjsionexplosion a year, we might have to agree to 15 megatons.     Our officialshave come to the conclusion, therefore, that we might aim at an arrange-ment whereby each of the three major atomic Powers restricted theirtests to an average level which produced no more, and preferably less,than 5 megatons of fission explosion a year, which could be accumulatedfor a maximum of three years.8.        We have considered carefully the question of control.    as our colleagues are aware, it has rot yet been possible to reach inter-national agreement on any measure of control of disarmament.     It is in
n a a6UIany oase difficult to see what practical measure of control could beapplied internationally to nuclear tests except the detection of explosionsand the estimate of their fission yield.     Various methods of detectionare used by the United States and ourselves as an intelligence operation against the Russians.   . Some of these methods have been mentioned in public and are well understood.     Others are treated as highly secret.Even with all the methods that we have been able to use, it is not possibleto reach an absolutely definite figure for the total yield of a nuclearexplosion and still less for the proportion of the yield contributed byfission in an explosion with both fission and fusion elements.     In view,however, of the importance we have attached to control in all disarmamentdiscussions abandonment by us cf any suggestion of control of limitationof tests would increase pressure on us to drop our insistence on effective control in the rest of the disarmament field.    We suggest therefore thatwe must at least propose to include in any agreement for limiting testssome semblance of control.     We therefore propose that, while no water-tight method of control appears feasible, we should prepare a form ofagreement whereby the signatories would give advance notice to asupervisory body composed of representatives of each of them of their intention to initiate each test series and similarly announce the end of eachtest series together with their own estimate of the total fission yield of the series as a whole.9.        We thus conclude that the only practical proposition at thepresent time is a declaration by the atomic Powers of their intention to limit the fission yield of their tests to a particular level.     a unilateral declaration by the United Kingdom, coupled with an invitation to the United States and Russia to make corresponding declarations, is aconceivable method, but to do this would be straining too far our partner-ship with the United States.     And it would weaken the stand which we have always taken against unilateral Soviet declarations, which we regard asmeaningless, and would leave the Russians complete freedom of action.Consequently we believe that it is essential, if we are to proceed in thematter at all, to aim at agreement by the United States and U.S.S.R. to a tripartite declaration before we make any public announcement of our intentions,10.       It is thus in our view absolutely essential that we should try-to carry the United States with us.     We can expect very strong opposition from the United States s not only in the light of the statements referredto in paragraph 6 above, but also in view of their disagreement with usover limitation last year and the likelihood that they would dislike theidea of being limited to the same fission yield as the United Kingdom.On the other hand, it is possible that at any moment the United states might decide that they now know so much about nuclear weapons that theycould dispense with any further tests.     In this event it is possiblethat they would, with no adequate warning to us, change suddenly theirpresent position and announce their willingness to abolish tests, without taking into account whatever might then be the state of the British nuclearweapon programme.     We ,are therefore of the opinion that we should informthe Americans that we have most carefully considered the problem presented by the continuation of nuclear tests by the three major Powers and thepossibility that other Powers may wish to enter the field, and that wehave concluded that it is essential that we should try to reach an agreedposition between the three major Powers on the limitation of tests BWe should explain to the United States that, after studying the historyof nuclear tests eo far and all the information available to u3 on thepossible dangers to health, we should be prepared to agree that a worldtotal average annual rate of 15 megatons of fission a year should be themaximum for the present and that we are prepared, either in theDisarmament Commission or outside it, if that seems more appropriate, tojoin with the United States and the U.S.S.R. in making a tripartite declaration that we shall each limit ourselves to a f issi on yield of5 megatons a year.
9 f] 911.      We therefore invite our colleagues to agree that:-(l)     in the light of our present knowledge, a world annual average yield of 15 megatons of fission (on theunderstanding that a Power might accumulate its share over a period of not more than 3 years) is amaximum figure for the next few years, or until abetter system of limitation is devised;(ii)     while no watertight method of control appears feasible,on general political grounds we cannot afford toabandon the principle of international supervision:and that the furthest we could go as an interim measure would be to propose an agreement wherebysignatories would give to a supervisory bodycomposed of representatives of each of them advancenotice of each test series and similarly an announce-ment of the ending of each test series and of theirown estimate of the total fission yield of the series.as a wholej(iii)     we should seek the concurrence of the United States andthe U.S.S.R. in a joint declaration on the lines indicated above;(iv)     we should approach the United States first and consider how best the approach should be made;(v)     we should defer further consideration of a unilateral declaration by the United Kingdom until we havedetermined how far it would be practicable to go inagreement with the United States.S.L.A.H.23rd October. 1956
