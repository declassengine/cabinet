1.5 ^(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET /^CP. (56)  229 COPY NO.,5th October, 1956CABINET&quot;3(9SPECIAL REVIEW OF FARM prices memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and. food the National Farmers&apos;  Union for England and Wales has aksedfor a special review of farm prices follo\ving the award bythe Agricultural. Wages Board for England and Wales of anincrease of 6s. a week in the minimum agricultural wage from &apos;1+th September.    The Scottish Agricultural Wages Board have turned down a similar claim and the Board in Northern Irelandhave deferred further consideration of a claim in thatcountry until 10th October.2. The background on this occasion is that -(i)    EJarlier this year we warned the Farmers&apos; Unionsthat we should need to take a severe view inpresent circumstances of any request for aspecial review and that in any event they shouldnot assume full recoupment of any wage increase.(ii)    The Unions protested vigorously against any suggestion of less than full recoupment, if aspecial review were held,  on the ground thatthis would be a unilateral alteration of the1946 agreement between the then Government andthe Farmers&apos;  Unions; but they did not contestthe right of the Government to take a severeview of the justification for holding aspecial review at all.(iii)    Since then we have been faced with a serious deterioration in the industry&apos;s prospects forthe year,  owing to the bad harvestingconditions.Case against a special review3. Were it not for the deterioration in the industry&apos;sprospects, the case against accepting the request for aspecial review would be overwhelming -(i)    The national economic situation requires that  weshould adhere to our declared policy of taking a severe view in present circumstances.
(ii)    The effects of the award taken by themselves arenot of sufficient importance to warrant a special review;    The full year effect will be about. 7-2&quot; millions and the part year effect (theamount the industry will in fact have to findto meet additional wages before any new annual review determinations can become effective) isabout  5 millions;  and these effects are limited to England and Wales.(iii)   On no occasion since 19k7 has a special reviewbeen conceded for a wage change costing as little as  7-g- millions in a full year.    when we agreed to special reviews in 1955 and 1956the amounts involved on a part year basis were a little less than the present  5 millions; butwe were influenced primarily by the exceptionallyadverse weather conditions of 1954/55 and,although we are faced this year too withexceptionally bad weather conditions in Englandand Wales, we have warned the Unions that we mustbe guided by present national circumstances andnot by past precedents.h. If&apos;, nevertheless, we agreed to a special review,  itwould need to be on the grounds of the industry&apos;s special needs this year.    Although the farmers have been careful notto base their request officially on the weather situation, theyare stressing the difficulties facing the industry this year,including the disappointing beef market.    This would presentus with the further difficulty of deciding whether or not togrant full recoupment of the cost increase.    If the realreason for accepting the request for a special review werethe specially difficult situation in which the industry findsitself, we should I think find it hard to avoid full recoupmentof the wage increase and would risk spoiling the political effect of agreeing to a special review if we were to attemptto give less than full recoupment.    But full recoupment nowmight prejudice our prospects of securing satisfactory changesin the future, which has been one of our objectives as partof any arrangements for long-term assurances.    Moreover,if we turn down a special review in present circumstances,there can be no question of charging us with any contravention of the 19^6 agreement &quot;between the then Government and the farmers&apos; Unions; but an attempt to avoid full recoupmentwould lead to such charges.5. At the moment there is no case, nor has a request beenmade, on behalf of Scotland for a special revievir.    But if we agree to one now for England and Wales, a further applicationfor increased wages is almost certain to be submitted inScotland and to be granted.Case for a special review6. The arguments for agreeing to a special review wouldbe -(i)   The serious position in which thefermers inEngland and Wales find themselves at present.Although most of the hay and cereal harvest will now be got in, much of it will be in poorcondition and the harvesting operationswill have involved some loss and additionalexpense.    This comes on top of a weak market
for fat cattle which has depressed farmers&apos;returns below the guaranteed price.   We must expect all this to have a had effect on theindustry&apos;s net income for the year.    This will show up at the next annual review and will formthe basis for a claim for increased guarantees.Anything   we do to put more money into theindustry for the current year, and for thecurrent year only,  should reduce the forceof such a claim at the annual review.(ii)   The precedents of 1955 and 1956, and the fact thatthe wage increase to he carried by theindustry before any fresh annual reviewdeterminations become effective affects not onlythe crop prices for 1957 hut also some partof the current crop year and half the live-stock year (to end March 1957).(iii)    The possible prejudice to the outcome of thediscussions on long-term assurances if therewere a dispute now with the Farmers&apos; Unionsabout the holding of special review (thoughit would probably be more damaging to havea serious dispute about the basis for recoup-ment).conclusion. It looks at present as if the harvest will call forno immediate special help beyond what we. have done already.The general national requirements are against accepting therequest for a special review.    If the industry can be helped by a special arrangement on the beef price guarantee, thiswould be preferable to accepting a special review.8. My colleagues may feel therefore that we shouldturn down the request for a special review on the groundthat in present national circumstances we must take a severeview, that we must consider this apart from the specialweather conditions, that if that is done the case is notstrong enough to warrant a review, and that we are assisting the industry in other and more appropriate ways to meet thedifficulties created by the weather and by the unexpected fallin the beef market.D.PI.A.Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food,  S.W.1 .5th October, 1956
