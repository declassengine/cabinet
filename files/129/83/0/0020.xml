Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.   52CP. (56) 22028th September, 1956CABINETHOUSING OF FOREIGN WORKERS IN GIBRALTARMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColoniesThis paper is circulated for information.2. At its meeting on the 20th October, 1955 (CM. (55) 36th Conclusions,Minute 2), the Cabinet discussed the possibility of constructing enough new buildings in Gibraltar to make the Colony independent of daily labour from Spain.I was invited to circulate a memorandum on this subject.3. One of my Housing Advisers visited Gibraltar to examine this problem and the Annexe to this paper summarises his report and the comments on it ofthe Departments concerned. The report concludes that 4,600 dwellings would benecessary in order effectively to replace the labour force from Spain. The costof building these dwellings would he at least  11-^ million and the cost of site-clearance, foundations and ancillary services would considerably increase this figure.There would, in addition, be great difficulty in finding enough suitable sites. these estimates presuppose the necessity of maintaining the total number of workers at present employed in Gibraltar. They would be lower if it were possible toreduce this number by dispensing with some of the less essential workers.4. In the memorandum which the Foreign Secretary and I have submittedabout the differential in cost-of-living allowances (CP. (56) 216) we explainedthat there will shortly be an opportunity to discuss labour supply with the SpanishGovernment. It is clear that it is neither necessary nor practicable, pending theresults of our talks with the Spaniards, to contemplate any project of the natureoutlined above. It may, however, be concluded that, if the present Spanish labourrestrictions continue and result in the course of time in a serious reduction in thelabour force available, at least part of the Spanish labour force may have to bereplaced by additional labour to be accommodated on the Rock, and the provisionof housing for this labour would be costly. This cost may be some measure tous of the comparative advantage in improvement of relations with Spain and inparticular in removing any discrimination which may provide an apparentjustification to Spain for continuing its labour restrictions.A.

ANNEXEHOUSING OF FOREIGN WORKERS IN GIBRALTARI. Summary of a Report by one of the Housing Advisers to the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies(i) The working population of Gibraltar numbers about 7,000. In addition the Colony depends on a large number of Spanish workers who cross the borderdaily and these total about 12,800 8,300 men and 4,500 women. An increase in demand for foreign labour is expected on account of Government and Servicebuilding programmes and the Port Development scheme, which will amount to a need for 3,000 additional workers. The labour required for the permanent buildingunder consideration, together with ancillary services, might total 5,000. Theproblem therefore would be to provide permanent dwellings for some 12,800permanent workers and temporary dwellings for some 8,000.(ii) Assuming that the foreign workers had a family pattern similar to thatof the Gibraltarians (as have the Spanish, Maltese and Italians for instance)12,800 extra workers would involve additional accommodation for 28,000 persons,a number exceeding that of the present population of Gibraltar (25,000). assuming that the families could be housed six persons to each household (compared withthe present average in Gibraltar of 4-1), 4,600 homes would be needed.(iii) As suitable sites are few the provision of this number of permanent houses in Gibraltar would probably necessitate building in blocks of many storeys insome cases 12 to 15. A preliminary examination indicates that sites are availablefor less than one-third of the permanent accommodation required. If a schemeto provide 4,600 homes were to be implemented it would be necessary for theService Departments to contribute land from within their zones. There is not thought to be any suitable land available within either the Dockyard area or theRAF. zone and the land would have to be found from within the military zoneat Europa point.(iv) The housing of this labour force would create a need for expenditure inmany other directions. Extra schools, shops, hospitals and open spaces would,for instance, be necessary. In addition drastic expansion of the existing public services would be involved, including the construction of a treatment plant forsewage, perhaps inside the Rock. The road and traffic system would also needoverhauling.(v) The cost of building 4,600 permanent homes is estimated at  11-j million,excluding the cost of site clearance and of special foundations which would be considerable. No estimates have been made of the cost of the ancillary servicesmentioned in (iv) above.II. Summary of Comments on the report. The report summarised above has been seen by the Governor, the service departments, the Gibraltar Co-ordinating Committee and the Treasury. TheAir Ministry have not commented in detail on the substance of the memorandumat this stage, but have noted that the scheme would have serious implications fortheir interests in Gibraltar. They would, therefore, wish to have an opportunityof commenting in detail if it were to be taken further. The Treasury havecommented that it is very doubtful if the plan would be practicable, and suggestthat it is doubtful if the Spaniards would co-operate while building was in progress.The Admiralty have pointed out that the water supply might be inadequate, and suggest that to increase Gibraltar&apos;s population would, if food had to be imported,tend to increase rather than reduce the Colony&apos;s dependence on Spain. TheWar Office have also considered the plan and found it impracticable for various reasons. The Governor considers that the report is a useful survey of this aspect of the labour problem. It would be necessary in any case to build more homes for Gibraltarians. It has already become necessary on account of the Spanishlabour restrictions to review priorities of works in Gibraltar and allocation oflabour to them. If the restrictions at present placed on the entry of Spanish labour should continue for a number of years it will be necessary to review the workspriorities again and it may become necessary to provide accommodation for somenon-Gibraltarian labour in Gibraltar.
