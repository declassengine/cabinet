Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1956Copy No.CABINETPREFERENTIAL TARIFF ON MEATMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee have been considering the possibility of placing some restriction upon imports of foreign meat to this country in the lightof representations from the Australian and New Zealand Governments, basedupon their Ottawa Agreements, and from the National Farmers&apos; Union in theinterest of home producers. All concerned are alive in particular to the renewalin the last year of competition in the United Kingdom market of high qualityArgentine chilled beef. Foreign imports are in fact still some 30 per cent belowthe pre-war figure, to which they are unlikely to return in the foreseeable future,but beef prices, though still high in relation to other meat, have fallen from the levels they reached in the scarcity conditions which previously prevailed and whichhave now been ended by the recovery of Argentine imports.2. Before the war both Australia and New Zealand enjoyed the benefitsfirstly of a preferential quota system, which, while regulating Commonwealthsupplies, held foreign imports of beef, mutton and lamb in check, and, from 1937,of specific duties on chilled and frozen beef which were equivalent to 15 or 20 percent ad valorem of pre-war prices. There are now no quotas, and with presentimported beef prices equal to some 4 to 44 times those pre-war, the specific duties on beef are now equivalent to only some 4 per cent ad valorem. Australia,however, also has the 15-year Meat Agreement concluded in 1952 which assuresher minimum prices for meat exported to the United Kingdom through a systemof deficiency payments if prices realised in the open market fall below guaranteedminima. The Australians have nevertheless represented that the Meat Agreementitself does not provide sufficient assurance of a remunerative market. NewZealand, on the other hand, has nothing except an unrestricted entry, and as new Zealand&apos;s representations to the Government have shown, they are likely topress for something more if our Ottawa preferences are not to be at risk.3. No doubt the first preference of Australia and New Zealand would befor a quota system, but all the countries concerned have undertaken in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.) to eliminate pre-war quantitativepreferences. Moreover, pre-war experience snowed that, once a system of quotasis accepted, the Government is driven more and more into a position of controlling the trade in all its details, and the logical outcome would be that quotas wouldhave in due course to be imposed on imports from the Commonwealth as well asfrom foreign sources. This would not be in the interests of Australia and NewZealand. The Economic Policy Committee have, for these and other reasons,ruled out the solution by quotas and have considered the alternative of a preferential tariff, which is in this instance allowed by the arrangements under theG.A.T.T., and has recently been adopted in the case of pigmeat.4. About tfrree-quarters of imports of meat from foreign sources are beef,and the decline which has taken place in meat prices is very largely confined tobeef.   The main effect of any tariff on foreign meat, even although it appliedSECRETCP. (56) 21927th September, 195650551
also to mutton and lamb, would thus probably be in relation to beef and negotiations would centre on the beef tariff. A tariff is therefore likely to be of greater benefit to Australia (whose exports are mainly beef) than to New Zealand.5. Australian frozen beef is of inferior quality to Argentine chilled beef,and the general pattern of consumer preference seems to indicate that purchaserswould prefer to pay more for the better quality of meat. A tariff therefore mightnot necessarily restrict the volume of foreign imports. On the other hand, evenif the effect was only to increase prices, it could be represented as of real advantage to Australia, and thus acceptable as a fulfilment of our Ottawa obligations and asa substitute for the 15-year Agreement.6. As New Zealand would automatically benefit from any tariff on beef, itwould be essential to negotiate with, her to ensure that any settlement we reachwith Australia would also be accepted by New Zealand in satisfaction of ourOttawa commitments on beef. Since 75 per cent of New Zealand&apos;s exports of meat to the United Kingdom are mutton and iamb, in which field foreigncompetition is very limited, it might be thought that a tariff on beef would be of relatively little advantage to her. But New Zealand is developing her beef exports,and in particular her exports of chilled beef which have to make headway againstArgentine competition, so that it is in this field that preference would be of mostvalue to her. Indirectly, since beef prices affect mutton and lamb prices, a tariff on beef might be expected at least to prevent a fall in the latter and possibly to push them up. Nevertheless, since our general commitments under Ottawa extend to mutton and lamb as well as beef, we must be prepared, if negotiating pressure from New Zealand requires us, to impose a corresponding (perhaps lower) dutyon mutton and lamb.7. Officials have recommended that we should seek agreement on the basisof a tariff of not more than 10 per cent on carcase beef, mutton,mind lamb. . 10 percent is the general level of our ad valorem tariff and the rate adopted for pigmeat,and with United Kingdom consumption only now reaching the,pre-war level, weare by no means in the conditions of over supply and depressed prices in whichthe Ottawa commitments were first given. It is, in any case, a logical corollary ofthe replacement of our Ottawa Agreement by a tariff that the Meat agreement should. be terminated. The Agreement is an asset of diminishing value toAustralia and. the Australian Government, find the financial arrangementsadministratively difficult... .. But the Australian Government may nevertheless be reluctant to give up the.Meat Agreement in return for a. 10 per cent tariff. In orderto secure a comprehensive settlement, the Economic Policy Committee felt therefore that we may have to concede up to. a 15 per cent tariff on beef, though we shouldnot go above 10 per Cent on mutton.8. An objection which must be considered in relation to any such proposal isits effect on the cost of living. If the tariff were assumed to have the effect of raising not merely the price of imported meat but the general level of meat prices in the United Kingdom, a 10 per cent increase would theoretically add 0-4 points to the costrof-living index, and a 15 per cent increase, 0-6 points. Though suchprice additions might not become effective till 1958, the announcement of negotiations for a meat tariff would be linked in the public mind with the increasesattributable to the removal of the bread and milk subsidies, and other increases inthe cost of tobacco, fares arid coal for which the Government can be held directlyof indirectly responsible. But while for the purposes of negotiation we are boundto argue that a tariff, if it did hot actually restrict imports, would at any rate raisebeef prices,, we cannot forecast with certainty.what its actual effect would be. in actual fact some part of the tariff wolild probably be borne by the foreign suppliers.Moreover, prices of meat generally have been tending to fall, and the impositionof a tariff might do little more than prevent this trend going so far as it otherwise would., ,9., A further difficulty is that a tariff on meat might adversely affect our trade relations with Argentina,., at a time,when they seem likely to improve: though we have made it clear to the Argentines in.recent negotiations that we remain.free to negotiate with them about meat, tariffs, the, Argentine producers might be seriously affected. This: involves the risk of Argentina^ adoption of a highprotectionist tariff against us and might hinder the possibility of stepping up our exports there.
10. Against such objections should be set our need to conclude a friendlysettlement of our outstanding trade problems with Australia and New Zealand ona long-term footing, and the advantage of replacing the pre-war obligations beforeserious difficulties of interpretation arise, considerations which particularly affect our relationship with Australia. Without a satisfactory settlement of ouroutstanding trade problems with Australia and New Zealand, Plan G would be unlikely to be acceptable to these two countries. Moreover, a tariff on foreignmeat might have a useful effect in reassuring home producers who have beendisturbed by the recent falling off in the beef prices, and to the extent that thetariff had the effect of raising the general price level of meat, it would reduce theburden on the Exchequer of deficiency payments under the agricultural guarantees.11. The Economic Policy Committee have taken the view, in the context ofour recent consideration of future commercial policy generally, that these advantages outweigh the objections to which I have referred above. To impose a tariff on foreign meat must none the less be a serious step at this time because ofits possible implications for the cost of living. For this reason the committee agreed that the matter must be referred for decision by the Cabinet.12. If the Cabinet approve the principle of a preferential tariff on foreignmeat, the Economic Policy Committee would propose that negotiations should be opened first with Australia on the basis of a 10 per cent tariff with discretion tonegotiate up to 15 per cent in the case of beef. Oversight on these negotiations should be entrusted to the group of Ministers who are in charge of the trade talks with Australia.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,24th September, 1956.
