secret.I .(56) 226 COPY NO.2nd October, 1956.CABINETCYPRUSNote by the Minister of State for Foreign AffairsThe Greek Government are determined to bring the cyprus question to the United Nations and have already put down the following item for inclusion in the Agenda of the 11th Session:&quot;Application under the auspices of the United Nations, of the principleof equal rights and self-determination of peoples in the case of thepopulation of the Island of Cyprus&quot;.2. Last year the General Assembly refused to inscribe an identical Greek item on the Agenda by 28 votes to 22 with 10 abstentions.It would be extremely difficult to repeat this result now because:(a) the new members will probably tip thebalance against us;      and(b) we cannot maintain as convincingly as we did last year that &quot;quiet diplomacy&quot; has notbeen given a proper chance.In any case we could only hope to defeat inscription if the UnitedStates Government gave us their immediate all-out support, and it is evident from all the indications we have had that this will not be forthcoming in time, if at all.3. It is clearly important to avoid giving the Greeks the encouragement and advantage of an initial victory such as they would gain by defeating us in a vote on inscription of their item.    At thesame time we do not want to have to fight solely on ground of Greekchoosing.4. Accordingly the Foreign Secretary is proposing:(i)    not to vote against inscription of the Greekitem;      andto put down an item of our own charging theGreek Government with incitement of violence and terrorism in Cyprus.
i &apos;!k 2A.N.Foreign Office, S.W.I.2nd October, 1956.(a) enable us to take part in a debate on Cypruswithout prejudicing our principles aboutdomestic jurisdiction;(b) give us the chance to put our case beforethe United Nations more fully and positively;and(c) give us room for manoeuvre.5. By putting down an item of our own we shall aim to achieveone of the following results:(a) Mutual withdrawal of the United Kingdom and greek items;(b) A resolution that neither item should bediscussed;(c) An arrangement whereby neither item wouldbe reached by the time the Assembly adjourned;(d) An innocuous resolution.6. The final date for putting down an item under the normal procedure is 12th October.    Mr. Dulles knows we are thinking of doing this and has urged that we should postpone action.Sir ?i?ierson Dixon, our Permanent Representative to the United Nations,has advised strongly against postponement because we should then have to claim, in order to get our item inscribed, that it had anemergency character.    V/e agree that this would be fraught withdanger.    Moreover, we cannot start full-scale lobbying until wehave decided our own attitude.    The Foreign Secretary thereforeproposes to put down our item before 12th October and to tellMr. Dulles so, explaining that we have shown great patience and thatif the Americans wish to prevent a discussion of Cyprus at the united nations it is up to them to use their influence with the Greeks.
