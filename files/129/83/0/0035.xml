Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1956SECRET Copy No.CP. (56) 23516th October, 1956CABINETGOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE: ECONOMIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in my Budget Speech of last April I said that the Government had decidedto put in hand a review of all Government expenditure, civil and military, in orderto achieve savings amounting to  100 millions in this current year on services provided in the Estimates as published. I later explained that for this purpose should on the one hand ignore additional necessary expenditure not providedfor in the Estimates; and that, on the other hand, I would not take credit forunderspendings on the Estimates during the year apart from those deliberatelyplanned.2. On 26th June I made an interim announcement of savings amounting toabout  76 millions. Of this total,  361 millions was on the defence programme, 14 millions on defence expenditure by civil Departments and  25i millions on other civil Estimates. (I understand that of the defence element&quot; in the first 76 millions savings, some  5 millions has been, or is likely to be, lost as a result of suez.)3. I must announce as soon as possible after Parliament reassembles how we propose to save the balance of  24 millions.4. Some further contributions have been agreed by Departments and someothers, not so agreed, I now invite the Cabinet to approve. The total of all these is about  13^ millions, made up as follows the items marked with an asterisk beingthose which I ask my colleagues to approve:  (A) Defence:   millionsArmy (economies in Germany)............ 2-0   (approx.)Navy (miscellaneous)    ............... 0-2        ,,Air (reduction of intake of manpower)......... 2-0        ,,Total for defence   .....:      .........      4-2        ,,(B) Civil:Civil Defence (miscellaneous)   ............      0-foreign Office (Jordan Loan) ...      ...      ...      ...      0-75Colonial   Office   (Kenya   Loan    1   million   and miscellaneous)       ......      ...      ...      ...      1-25* Health Services:  Prescriptions (Is. an item from 1st December,1956)    ............      ......      0-75Reductions of Hospital stocks    ...      ...      ...      0-5*Milk, ordinary (increase of retail price by a further\d. from 1st January, 1957)       .........      4-5*Welfare milk (charge to be increased by Id. from 1st January, 1957)...............      0-7Travelling and Subsistence (all Departments to cut the provision in the Estimates by 10 per cent, offive-twelfths, i.e., a cut of 10 per cent, in theaverage monthly rate of provision from 1st November, 1956)       ............      0-5Total for Civil      ...............      9-25Total for Defence and Civil5065413-45 (approx.)
5. On the items marked with an asterisk above, I would make the following comments:  Health Services. The total net cost of the Health Services is over 500 millions a year. This large and annually increasing expenditure has sofar made no contribution to the  100 millions saving (apart from about 500,000 on civil defence). The proposal to increase the prescription chargefrom Is. per form to Is. per item was exhaustively discussed in the social services Committee who agreed to put it forward to the Cabinet. I thinkit is now time to decide that this change shall be made: it cannot seriouslybe argued that it will cause hardship in any quarter. In my view there is astrong case for an even bigger increase. The number and cost of national health Service prescriptions is still rising sharply and this year&apos;s Estimate isHkely to be exceeded by  3-4 millions on this account.The saving from the new charge in a full year would be over  5 millions.On hospital stocks, which are in some cases clearly excessive, I would propose to take credit for this year&apos;s saving from a process of reduction whichthe Minister of Health has already pressed on the hospital authorities.Milk (ordinary). I explained in my Budget speech our general attitude to the food subsidies that it does not make sense artificially to cheapen theprices of bread and milk for everyone irrespective of need. In presentcircumstances, when one of our principal troubles is excessive personal consumption, it is particularly foolish to do so. The subsidy now remainingon ordinary milk amounts to about \d. a pint, costing  22 millions a year,and I am sure that we ought to get rid of it at a fairly early date. I proposethat officials should work out proposals for increasing the retail price by \d.- a pint from 1st January, 1957, and for dealing with any remaining difficultiesin the way of finally removing the subsidy.A further increase of \d. a pint in the retail price would add 0-22 of apoint to the Index of Retail Prices. The Index has been steady since April,with a slight trend downwards and, even with the proposed increase for milk,it is likely by the end of the. year to be well within the increase of 2-3 pointsover this year, to which I referred in a public speech in May last.Welfare Milk. At present the charge for this milk is \\d. a pint,compared with the ordinary retail price of l\d. a pint. The charge has remained at \\d. since 1946 when the full retail price was only A\d. Anincrease of Id. in the charge for welfare milk would cover the \d. increasein the price of ordinary milk made on 1st July and the further increase of%d. proposed above. The total charge would then be 5d. below the presentfull retail price and 5\d. below the new retail price if the latter were increasedby the further \d. proposed above. This difference would still be adequaterecognition of our desire to encourage the consumption of milk by young children and expectant mothers.Travelling and Subsistence. This proposal explains itself. I cannot thinkthat any department would be unreasonably handicapped in the dischargeof its functions if it restricted its travelling by one-tenth for the remainder of this financial year. Travelling and subsistence costs are one of the items in the Estimates which are most criticised, however uninformed such criticismmay sometimes be.6. The need for further immediate economies. Even if all the above proposals are approved, we shall only show  13^ millions towards the  24 millionsneeded, making about  90 millions out of the  100 millions. I must therefore askall my colleagues to consider very seriously what contributions they can respectivelymake towards finding the balance. It is unthinkable that we should not honour ourpublic commitment to find the  100 million. Moreover, although the unavoidableand large additional expenditure to which we have committed ourselves since theBudget on Suez and other services is outside the  100 millions operation, such additional expenditure makes it all the more urgent to make economies on theoriginal Estimates. In particular, J -must ask that every effort shall be made toincrease the defence contribution.to the  24.millions-say, by another  5 millions atleast.7. Defence policy. I am very much concerned about the delay in settlingvarious medium- and long-term questions of our defence policy. I realise that the suez affair has inevitably slowed down the progress we hoped to make on these
questions. Nevertheless, it is now very urgent that the studies which we put inhand some months ago should be completed quickly. If we are to make aconvincing case, in the impending reappraisal of NATO policy, for changes whichwill relieve bur own defence burdens, we must be quite clear in our own mindswhat new policy we want and how we justify it. At present no such case exists,and there is grave danger that failure to have it ready in time will prejudice all we hope for from the reappraisal.Completion of the defence studies now in hand is also urgent in order that therelief which we expect from them may be reflected as fully as possible in theDefence Estimates for 1957-58.8. General. Apart from all the above more or less immediate problems, i must take this opportunity of emphasising how necessary it is for us to adopt the strictest possible policy of economy in considering proposals for new or extendedservices involving additional expenditure. Present forecasts suggest that civilSupply expenditure in .1957-58 will be some  160 millions more than the total for1956-57 after allowing for the  76 millions of savings already announced and thesupplementaries taken in July; of this increase, the social services account for 100 millions. In face of such a forecast, and the continuing pressing need to keepGovernment demands on the national resources to the minimum, we clearly cannot afford to incur additional commitments which are not absolutely essential.- 9.   Recommendations. I invite my colleagues:  (a) to approve the items marked with an asterisk in paragraph 4 above and discussed in paragraph 5;(b) to let me know by the end of this month what contributions they can maketowards finding the remainder of the  24 millions needed;(c) to press on as quickly as possible with the studies now in progress of various aspects of our defence policy.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,15th October, 1956.
