&amp; U asecretCP.(56) 24524th October, 1956.WAR pensions memorandum by the Minister of Pensionsand National insurance the Chancellor of the  chequer in C.F.(56) 249indicates that the Ministers who have discussed the matter arein agreement about the circumstances in which a general increasein national insurance and war pensions rates would have to beconsidered.2. I should make it clear, as I did in the discussions inquestion, that I can only go so far with him on the basis that theproposals in CP.(56) 212 are given early implementation.    Ifthey are not, and the two acutest   points of pressure are thereforeleft unrelieved, my judgment is that it will not be possible to held the war pensions front as long as the Chancellor would like to see it held.     If we are unable to do this - and the figures in paragraph 3of my CP.(56) 212 show that it is the weakest part of the line - itwill then become impossible to hold national insurance rates, inwhich very large sums are involved.J.A.B. -c.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance,.
