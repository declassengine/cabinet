(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(56) 249COPY NO23rd October, 1956.cabinet war pensions memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer7/hen the Cabinet considered the memorandum by theMinister of Pensions on concessions for disabled war pensioners(CP.(56) 212), it was agreed that I should discuss the matter further,in the wider context of other possible benefit claims, with the Ministerof Labour and the Minister of Pensions   (CM.(56) 68th Conclusions,Minute 3).2.      Apart from my general objections to the Minister&apos;s proposals,I was anxious to know whether, having made concessions to war pensioners designed to avert an increase in the basic rate of warpensions, we should soon afterwards find ourselves having to considerwhether the national insurance benefit rates should be further increased on cost of living grounds.     Such an increase would of course compel us to increase the basic rate of war pensions.    My discussions withthe Minister of Labour and the Minister of Pensions have helped usto agree about the circumstances in which we might have to considera general increase in benefit rates and have removed my apprehensionson this particular point.3.      Nevertheless I feel bound to continue to oppose the Minister&apos;proposal to make war pension concessions forthwith.     It is aproposition for substantial expenditure at a time when I am callingon my colleagues to make economies.     vVe all agree that the Ministercannot make economies on war pensions or benefit rates;  but, at atime when I am pressing other Ministers to economise, I feel entitledto ask him to resist proposals for new expenditure longer than mightbe necessary in other circumstances.     I feel that our general policyof economy in public expenditure makes it necessary to resist the pressure for these concessions at any rate for a further period, and Ibelieve that it is politically feasible to take this line.     I recognise,however, that this is largely a matter of political judgment on whichthe Cabinet should take a decision.H. M.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.22nd October, 1956.
