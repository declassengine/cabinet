i1(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P,(56)206.7th. September, 1956.CABINETBECHUANALAND PROTECTORATEBAMANGWATO  SUCCESSIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations my colleagues will remember that in 1950 the Labour government decided to withhold recognition of Seretse Khama&apos;s succession to the chieftainship of the Bamangwato for a period which was to be not less than five years, and in 1952 we decided that his exclusion from the chieftainship should be made permanent.     There has been an important new development on which I should be glad to have my colleagues&apos; views.2..   On 15th August Seretse Khama and Tshekedi Khama came to see me and handed me a statement signed by them both.     In this statement Seretseand Tshekedi:-(a) renounce for themselves and their children any claim tosuccession of the Chieftainship of the Bamangwato (Tshekedi had,in fact, already done this in 1949 but Seretse, until now, hasrefused to do so);(b) state there is now no ground of dispute between them and that they wish to be allowed to live in peace with their families among theirown people;(c) declare that it is their policy to do everything they can to assisttheir own people to develope representative institutions;(d) state that they have no desire to dispute the right of the protecting power to appoint Rasebolai as African Authority, but that theyconsider that the tribe&apos;s progress would be helped by theestablishment of a Council.   They would like to return to theirown country &quot;as free citizens with as full political rights asanyone else, and to be allowed to serve our people in any capacity to which they may wish to elect us&quot;.3.     Our policy has been that Seretse Khama should absent himself from the protectorate until an alternative chief has been securely established withhis own native administration.   Ideally, I should have liked to seeRasebolai established as chief before Seretse returns to the Protectorate.The procedure for appointing a chief is that he is first &quot;designated&quot; by the tribe assembled in kgotla; that designation must then be &quot;recognised&quot; bythe High Commissioner and &quot;confirmed&quot; by the Secretary of State.   ToCOPY NO.
get Rasebolai designated by the tribe as Chief it would be essentialthat Seretse and Tshekedi should advocate and support that designation.I have pressed them to do this but they will not.    They both assureme that they will support Rasebolai as African Authority but thatthey cannot advocate or support his designation as Chief becausethey believe that the tribe would not designate him, even ifSeretse and Tshekedi had declared their support for him.4.      Tshekedi and Seretse have assured me that, if theGovernment see fit, by some other means than tribal designation,to make Rasebolai Chief, they would support him in that Office.But the law of Bechuanaland precludes the appointment of a Chiefby any other means than that involving designation by the tribein kgotla, and in any case both the Labour Government and we our-selves have declared publicly that a Chief will not be imposed uponthe tribe.5.      I have come to the conclusion that there is no prospect of getting Rasebolai established as Chief in the immediate future;   even so I think we must try to find a way of letting Seretse return to his country.     His unconditional renunciation of the Chieftainshipcreates a new situation.     We should be justly criticised if we failedto take advantage of it to restore to Seretse and also to Tshekeditheir ordinary liberties.6.      I think, therefore, that we should aim at allowing Seretseto return to the Reserve, with Rasebolai continuing as AfricanAuthority.     If all goes well Seretse and Tshekedi would have their political liberties restored to them gradually depending on conditions in the Reserve.     We should, at the same time, arrangefor the creation of an Advisory Council at the headquarters of the african Authority.     We have long been committed to this inprinciple.     It has been delayed mainly because of the dissensionsin the tribe, some of the members of which have adopted the attitude that it could not be set up in the absence of Seretse.     We are constantly being urged in Parliament to press on with the creationof more representative institutions in the Bechuanaland Protectorate.(In the debate in the Commons on 1st August nearly every speakeron both sides of the House urged this).    Both Tshekedi and Seretseadvocate it and if they are both in the Reserve exerting their influence in favour of a Tribal Advisory Council it should be possible to get it set up and working successfully.7.      Seretse and Tshekedi, whose influence in the tribe is boundto be great, would almost certainly become members of thisAdvisory Council;   it is right that their abilities and influence should thus be used for the benefit of the tribe.    They have both assuredme of their willingness to support Rasebolai as African authority and as Chairman of the Tribal -Advisory Council, and that it is notthe intention of either of them to attempt to supplant him in that position.    The appointment of the African Authority is, in any case,a matter for the Government;  the tribe in kgotla are not involvedas they must be in the designation of a Chief.     It would, I think,have to be made clear from the outset that the African authority would be Chairman of the tribal Council, so there would be no opportunity for Seretse or Tshekedi to secure that position for himself.
8.      There are certain conditions that would have to be fulfilled before we could proceed with this policy:(a)Rasebolai would have to agree to stay on asNative Authority with Seretse in the Reserveas a private citizen with full political rights;and(b) the tribe must be convinced of the genuine and permanent nature of Seretse&apos;s renunciation ofthe Chieftainship and in practice accept thatrenunciation and be ready to receive Seretseback into the Reserve as an ordinary memberof the tribe.The Resident Commissioner is sounding Rasebolai about (a) above and I am exploring, in consultation with the High Commissioner,the best means of satisfying ourselves about (b), which is a very important point.9. I have in mind to get a delegation from the Bamangwatoto come to London to hear Seretse&apos;s renunciation from his ownlips.10.    At the appropriate stage I contemplate an announcement which would cover the following points:(1)  Seretse&apos;s renunciation.(2)  Method of conveying it to the tribe.(3)  Seretse&apos;s and Tshekedi&apos;s support forRasebolai as African Authority andChairman of the Tribal Advisory Councilto be set up in application of existing government policy.(4)   Our intention that Seretse should eventually return as an ordinary citizenand that Tshekedi should be free to take part in the political life of the Bamangwato.11 .   If we are to take advantage of this new situation, we mustbe ready to act quickly.    I should be glad of my colleagues&apos;agreement to my continuing negotiations on the lines indicated above.     I will consult them again before the time comes to makea public announcement.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.7th September, 1956.
