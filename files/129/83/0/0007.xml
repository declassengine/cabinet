Printed for the&apos; Cabinet.   September&apos; 1956.Copy No.547rA September,, i95d ;;:;,CABINETPLAN G AND THE commonwealth memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth RelationsEven if it is thought that Plan G will benefit the United Kingdom economyit will have extremely important implications for the future of the commonwealth and it may be an extremely difficult operation to sell it to the Commonwealth.2. Commonwealth countries are likely to interpret the plan as meaning thatthe United Kingdom has decided to identify her fortunes more closely with europe and, however much we may protest that we mean to keep our Commonwealthlinks strong, they would have reason to fear that where trade goes, capital investment follows and political interests would tend to lean. I must warn mycolleagues that Plan G could lead to a permanent loosening of the Commonwealthbonds and through that to a weakening of the United Kingdom as a world Power,and this is an important consideration we must take into account even ifCommonwealth Governments do not press it upon us at this stage.3. It is quite fair to claim that it is in the interest of the Commonwealththat Europe should be economically strong and politically stable and that theUnited Kingdom&apos;s association, with her would help towards these desirable ends.It is possible to argue that free entry for the United Kingdom exporter to the250 million consumers of Europe would strengthen&apos;the economic base and finances of the United Kingdom so that we should have more resources available for investment in the Commonwealth. But it is also possible to argue the contrary.In any case this argument is speculative and debatable and well in the future andI am convinced that it would not carry the day and would merely arouse themisgivings and suspicions of our intentions which I have outlined above.4. Free trade with Europe within 10 years means that all Commonwealthpreferences here vis-a-vis Europe on manufactured goods and raw materials would disappear. Canada already has a substantial trade with us in such goods and almost all Commonwealth countries hope in varying degrees to develop their trade with us in manufactured goods. Unless we offered them decisivecompensating advantages they could not be expected to abandon these hopesby supporting Plan G on economic grounds.5. Thus if we decide that the Plan on balance is in our interests, the onlypossibility of persuading the Commonwealth countries to accept it would be to compensate them for the loss of their preferences on their exports here (bothexisting and potential) of manufactured goods and raw materials by some reallyimaginative action to help their primary producers to market larger quantitiesof produce in the United Kingdom.6. In theory the exclusion of agriculture from the free trade area, for whichPlan G provides, could give the opportunity. In practice the necessity, which I accept, not to interfere with United Kingdom farm production and the difficultiesof hitting the foreigner, which is the only alternative, make it very doubtful whether we could devise a plan of agricultural aid to the Commonwealth which would carry conviction.50497
7. The Asian members of the Commonwealth would be less affected thanthe old members. For the latter, the very least which would be necessary wouldbe:-(a) A guaranteed purchase of 1 million tons of wheat from Australia (whichwe hope to embody in any case in a new bilateral agreement with australia).(b) A 15 per cent, tariff on meat which would probably fulfik our Ottawapledges to New Zealand and replace our meat agreement with Australia.(c) Arrangements to give Commonwealth producers of fresh, dried and canned fruit a more secure assurance than they have at present of aremunerative market in the United Kingdom and in the case of Canadaa bigger share of our market.(d) A reduction in the duty on heavy wines.(e) Canada is a specially difficult problem and particular arrangements would need to be made to assist her exports of manufactured goods to thiscountry.(a) and (b) would represent no more than the implementation of our existing obligations which flow from Ottawa and (c), (d) and (e) are therefore important.All these present formidable difficulties, as the examination by officials has shown,but unless we can take decisions to put them into practice I am sure we cannotsell Plan G. Until it is clear what can be done I must reserve my attitude to thePlan.8. Meanwhile, I have no objection to Plan G being explored with commonwealth Finance Ministers in Washington in a very tentative way. Butfollowing that, ample time must be given for Commonwealth Governments toreact and for us to assess their reactions. Meanwhile we should remainuncommitted. Too much is at stake in the long run to try and push Plan G in ahurry.9. Apart from my fears about the effects of the Plan on the future of theCommonwealth, unless we can contrive imaginative proposals covering primaryproduce which might enable us to carry Commonwealth countries with us, Ishould have to advise that we should drop the Plan.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,7th September, 1956.
