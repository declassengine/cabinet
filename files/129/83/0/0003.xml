(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.(56) 203 COPY NO.20th August, 1956.CABINETROYAL NAVY:   TIME-EXPIRED REGULARSMemorandum by the First Lord of the admiralty in order to carry out the Navy&apos;s task over Suez it willbe essential in the very near future to retain men whose engagementsare about to expire.     The commitments we have accepted involve a deficit of 1,500 - 2,000 men, some part of which we are meeting byemergency measures such as taking men fromthe training establishments and ships under repair, and some part of which we cannot meet even though we are not yet manning the ships concerned up to the war complement.&quot;Whether the Suez precautionary measures develop into operations or not,the steps we have taken will cause very serious disruption if they have tobe continued for more than another week or so.2. Unlike the other two Service Departments, the admiralty have no power to retain time-expired ratings or Royal Marine other rankswithout a Proclamation.    Administrative action in this direction is limited to:-(a) acceptance of voluntary extensions of service;     and(b) postponement of terminal leave until after the properrelease date.Both measures are in operation now wherever profitable.     They are quiteinsufficient, however, to effect the general manning problem.3. Action to retain the seven-year engagement men ought reallyto be taken straightaway, though I do not contemplate, at present anyhow,retaining men who complete the longer engagements of twelve years andtwenty-two years.     But my colleagues may well feel, as I do myself, thatno retentions of time-expired men in circumstances involving publicity should take place until after the London Conference.. 4. In that case I must stress that unless the result of theConference is the successful and immediate resolution of the problemwe shall have to act very quickly, and not later than 31st August.    If theConference fails there would presumably be a ready recognition of theneed for drastic manpower measures.    Indeed, apart from retentions weshould have to face recalls of reservists into service.     But equally, ifthe Conference results in delayed decision, e.g. further deliberationshere or in the United Nations Organisation, during which time theGovernment would wish to maintain the precautionary measures (whether at slightly longer notice or not), there must at least be retentions, and perhaps some recalls of reservists.
1Ji5.Since this issue was first raised, it has been found thatthe 1950 Proclamation for the retention of time-expired men is still inforce, for it has never been formally cancelled.    I am advised thatlegally I could give instructions under this Proclamation for the retentionof any man who was serving on an engagement in the Royal Navy or royal marines at the date of the Proclamation and who is still in service.This would cover all but a handful of the men I want to retain;  but I am inclined to think that it is wrong and politically undesirable to use in thisway a Proclamation which *vas drawn up for the Korean emergency andwhich has only been left in existence by accident.6. The Treasury Solicitor has some misgivings about theissue of another Proclamation while the old one remains uncancelled, buthe accepts that another Proclamation would be necessary in order toretain those men now serving on engagements that were made after theissue of the 1950 Proclamation.    Accordingly my preference would beto have such a Proclamation issued so soon as the Government are ableto take stock of the situation at the end of the London Conference andin any case not later than 31st August.C.Admiralty, S.W.I.20th August, 1956.
