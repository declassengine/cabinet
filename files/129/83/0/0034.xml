secret.F.(56) 2346th October, 1956CABINETRENT RESTRICTIONMemorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal GovernmentOn 26th April, the Cabinet approved, as a basis for legislation toamend the Rent Acts, the recommendations in C. P. (56) 101 by theCommittee of Ministers set up for this purpose (CM. (56) 3lst Conclusions,Minute 6).2.      Since then the Committee have decided to recommend one additionto their earlier proposals, namely, that a slice of higher valued houses should be released from control at once under the Bill (subject to safe-guards as to notice, etc. ).    Apart from this addition, for which I ask mycolleagues1 approval, further study of the problem has not shown the needfor any changes in the Committee&apos;s earlier proposals.3.      The only question still outstanding is the extent of Scotland&apos;sparticipation in the Bill.    I understand that the Secretary of State will beraising this matter at Cabinet himself.D.
