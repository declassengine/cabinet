9 A(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE property  OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET- JfQC.P.(56) 209 COPY NO.        /15th September, 1956.CABINETPOLICE pay memorandum by the Secretary of State for the home department and the Secretary of State for scotland the Cabinet, at their meeting on 12th July (CM.(56) 4 9thConclusions, Minute 1), endorsed the view that there was no alternative to accepting the need to carry out the award of the arbitrators, back-datingto 8th September the pay increases awarded in December last, and authorised the Home Secretary to inform the House of Commons that theGovernment would discuss with the local authorities whether a provision to cover that award could be included in the proposed legislation toenable fuiiixe pt*y vacx&amp;s&amp;ea *o be given reiiOiipective exf-sci..2. We have now consulted the local authority associations.The County Councils Association and the Convention of Royal Burghs(Scotland) have agreed to our proposal,but the Association of municipal corporations and the Scottish County Councils Association are not willingto agree;  the Scottish Counties of Cities Association have not yet made their views known.     We have no doubt that notwithstanding the objectionsof two of the associations it would now be impossible for the Governmentto do other than implement the award.     We accordingly seek authorityto include an appropriate enabling provision in the Bill, for whoseintroduction as early as possible in the next Session authority has alreadybeen given, and to inform the associations that, after taking full accountof their views, the Government have thought it right to adopt this course.G, LL, *-G.J.
