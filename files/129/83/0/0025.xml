SECRETCP.(56) 225COPYNO. *bo2nd October, 1956CABINETAUSTRALIA:   TRADE TALKSMemorandum by the President of the Board of trade my colleagues will recall that our talks with the Australian PrimeMinister and the Minister of Trade (Mr. McEwen) were adjourned at theend of July to enable each side to study the other&apos;s proposals.   TheSecretary of the Australian Department of Trade (Mr. Crawford) isreturning to London this week and will be anxious to resume discussions as soon as possible.2.    The essential problem is whether we can offer the Australians some-thing which will preserve a satisfactory, though reduced, level of guaranteed preferences for our exports for at least five years.   In thisconnection the crux is - and has always been - wheat.   Before the talkswere adjourned, the Australians asked us to assure them a market here for about 1. 1 million tons of wheat a year (compared with current importsof about 650,000 tons) for five years.   We undertook to do our best to workout some satisfactory arrangement.3.    It is important on all grounds that we should achieve a satisfactoryoverall settlement with Australia, which is our biggest single export market.   &quot;We have published our intention to arrive at a comprehensive newTrade Agreement and have promised Mr. Menzies that we shall do our best to find a way of meeting Australia&apos;s difficulties over wheat.4.    The Minister of Agriculture has indicated in C.F.(56) 224 the resultsof our examination of the wheat problem since the adjournment of tradetalks.  He has set out various possible offers which we might make to the australians and has outlined the difficulties which these offers wouldinvolve for us.   I recognise that these difficulties are real.   I am satisfied, however, that officials in resuming the discussions withMr. Crawford should have authority to canvass the possibility of asatisfactory agreement on the basis of offering a &quot;best endeavours&quot;undertaking on wheat covering up to 850,000 tons a year.5.    I should not like my colleagues to under-estimate the difficultyof securing a satisfactory agreement with the Australians on the basisof an arrangement limited to a best endeavours undertaking by the millers in respect of 850,000 tons only and not involving any formalcommitment by the Government.     I myself am convinced that we must at any rate be in a position to be able to offer up to a million tons, and Iwould therefore urge that work on the compounders&apos; scheme referredto in paragraph 4 of CP.(56) 224 should be completed urgently so thatthe Cabinet will be able, if it comes to this, to weigh its disadvantagesagainst the possible breakdown of the negotiations with Australia.
(a) Substantial guaranteed preferences on capital goods and on our exports generally:  what wemost want here is to keep guaranteed preferenceson capital goods - our trade is  100 millions ayear - at 10 per cent if possible, in place of thepresent 12.J per cent;(b) freedom to eliminate Australia1 s guaranteedpreferences on a few non-agricultural items which would be affected by the adoption ofFlan G;(c) assurances about the non-discriminatory use ofAustralia&apos;s import restrictions.7.     I recommend  -(i) that the Cabinet should now approve the resumptionof negotiations for a five year trade agreement on the basis of a &quot;best endeavours&quot; undertakingon wheat of up to 850,000 tons a year in returnfor satisfactory undertakings in relation to ourchief aims; and(ii)  that work on the compounders&apos; scheme should becompleted as soon as possible so that theCabinet will be able to consider it urgentlyif the need arises.p.T.Board of Trade, S.W.1.2nd October, 1956.
