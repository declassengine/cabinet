Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 5 9CP. (56) 2161st October, 1956CABINETGIBRALTAR: COST-OF-LIVING ALLOWANCE FOR INDUSTRIALWORKERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and theSecretary of State for the ColoniesWhen the Cabinet discussed in July 1954 (C.C. (54) 56th Conclusions,Minute 1) the differential which exists in Gibraltar between the remuneration paidby official employers to Spanish workers and those paid to Gibraltarians, theColonial Secretary was invited to enquire of the Governor of Gibraltar whetherthe position could not be held for the time by an increase in the cost-of-livingallowance for Spaniards. The Governor at that time advised against this. the note by officials which is annexed sets out the history of this question and explainsthe moves that have been made since the last Cabinet discussion. It also explainsin detail the proposals summarised in this memorandum.2. The arguments for and against the abolition of the differential are setout in paragraphs 7 and 8 of the officials&apos; note and the following conclusions are reached:  (a) The differential should not remain in its present form.ib) To relate the allowances to the actual difference in living costs in spain and Gibraltar would be an unsatisfactory solution.(c) Restrictions in the Spanish labour force are likely, if continued, to confrontus with the need for heavy expenditure in Gibraltar.id) Our willingness to abolish the differential is likely to be an essential condition for any satisfactory understanding with the SpanishGovernment about labour supply.3. We accept these conclusions and invite our colleagues to agree in principle to the abolition of the differential, subject to the procedure set out in the following paragraph. Alternatively, we seek acceptance of the principle that there should in future be no discrimination which cannot be justified by a demonstrabledifference between the cost of living in Spain and in Gibraltar. In that case werecommend (subject again to the procedure set out below) that the SpanishGovernment should be informed and that it should subsequently be announcedthat we intend to investigate whether and to what extent a differential is justified by present living costs and that we mean to abolish by a certain date whateverpart of the differential is not so justified.4. Our aim would be to make use, in negotiations with the SpanishGovernment, of our willingness to offer a concession over the differential in returnfor an understanding with Spain over the flow of labour into Gibraltar. If an acceptable understanding can be reached on this basis we consider that our bargainwould be a good one. If, however, the Spaniards show themselves unwilling orunlikely to come to an agreement on the question of the labour supply, then adecision to abolish or modify the differential would not be carried out untilcircumstances are more favourable.50563
28th September, 1956.annex note by Officials on Cost-of-Living Allowances for Industrial Workersin GibraltarThe problem the working population of Gibraltar is approximately 20,000 strong.   Of11 ooO     these about-8^066&quot; are Spaniards who come from Spain daily.   Approximately&apos;       I   50 per cent, of the total force works for the official employers (the Services, the gibraltar Government and the City Council).2. The unskilled industrial worker in Gibraltar, if employed by the officialemployers, receives a basic wage of 40s. a week. Gibraltarian workers receivein addition a cost-of-living allowance of 48s. a week. Spanish workers similarlyemployed get a cost-of-living allowance of only 24s. (30s. in the case of city council employees). As a result of the recent investigation by Professor Jack,the total remuneration (of all workers) has been increased by a minimum of 17s.a week as from 1st November, 1955. The 50 per cent, differential in the cost-of-living allowance to Gibraltarian and Spanish workers originated in 1945 whenGibraltarians were given a cost-of-living allowance of 28s. a week in lieu of mealtickets issued during the war; Spaniards, who had not received meal tickets, were then given an allowance of 14s. a week. The latter amount was fixed arbitrarilybut the initial relationship between the two was subsequently treated as a 50 percent, differential and justified on the ground of the differences believed to exist between living costs in Spain and Gibraltar. Subsequent rises in the cost-of-living allowance have widened the differential from 14s. to 24s. (except in the caseof the City Council employees whose differential has been held at 18s. since 1951).3. The differential has for several years been the subject of representations by the Spanish authorities who claim that it is discriminatory. The GibraltarGovernment and City Council came to the conclusion in 1954 that it was anindefensible discrimination and should be abolished. This view was supportedby Her Majesty.&apos;s Ambassador in Madrid, and ourselves, and subseo,uently, bythe then Minister of Labour, whom the Cabinet asked to consider the question in 1954 (C.C. (54) 30th Conclusions). It was opposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer and Service Ministers on the grounds that the cost of living was lowerin Spain than in Gibraltar and that there was a ready supply of Spanish labourwilling to work in Gibraltar at existing rates of pay. Abolition would cost theBritish taxpayer  150,000 per annum, a good part of which would accrue to theSpanish Treasury in the form of customs duties and exchange transactions. TheCabinet nevertheless concluded that some change should be made in the existingdiscrimination in cost-of-living allowances and invited the Minister of Labour tosubmit his recommendations.4. After an examination of the relative costs of living in Spain and Gibraltar,the Minister of Labour once more advocated that the differential should be abolished (C. (54) 253), but suggested that, in the light of the conflicting views onthe subject, the Cabinet might consider, a compromise by agreeing to reduce the differential.- The Cabinet, on July 29, 1954 (C.C. (54) 56th Conclusions), invited the Colonial Secretary to ask the Governor of Gibraltar whether the position could not be held for the time being by increasing from 24s. to 34s. a week the5. We are now due to resume negotiations with the Spanish Governmentfor a social security convention. This would provide an opportunity to raise thequestion of labour supply for Gibraltar. The Spanish Government have recentlyindicated that they are prepared to consider concessions over labour supply inthe context of these talks.S. L.A. L.-B.
cost-of-living allowance for Spaniards employed by the Service Departments in gibraltar. The then Governor replied that, as there had been a deterioration in relations with Spain in the previous six months, he was convinced that it would do more harm than good to reopen the question of the differential by offering a token increase, unless at the same time we were prepared to say that our ultimateintention was to abolish it or reduce it to a point where it could be clearly justified.&apos;5. In recent months there have been two developments affecting this question,namely  .. ,(i) Spanish restrictions on labour supply.  Since the middle of 1955 the., Spanish authorities have frozen the Col6ny&apos;s labour supply by notissuing new workers&apos; passes. This will result in a gradual reductionin the Spanish labour force and.has already required official employers to, consult on the dovetailing of their works programmes. It also haspotentially serious implications for major schemes, e.g., portdevelopment.(ii) Her Majesty&apos;s Governments revised policy towards Spain. Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Madrid has invited the Spanish Government tore-examine in a friendly spirit those of its regulations applicable to gibraltar which have been brought into force since the beginning of1954. It is our view that if this policy is to succeed we must be in aposition to ensure that the Spaniards are deprived of any legitimategrounds of complaint against the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand the Gibraltar Government in matters affecting Spanish citizens,amongst which there can be no doubt that the Spanish authorities will include the continuance of the differential.The Governor of Gibraltar is also anxious that there should bean early settlement of this question on a basis which can. be readilydefended.Arguments For and Against Abolition6. The arguments for and against abolition of the differential have beenfully examined by officials and may be summarised as follows:  7. Against. (i) It is not appropriate to apply the principle of the rate for the job to Gibraltar, where the circumstances are not comparable with the positionanywhere in the United Kingdom.(ii) The true position in regard to the cost of living in Spain has not beenestablished and it is considered that there is still some difference in the. cost of livingbetween Spain and Gibraltar and that some differential is therefore justified.(iii) There is no certainty that the Spanish restrictions would be relaxed., ifthe differential were abolished.(iv) It would cost the British taxpayer  150,000 per annum.8. For.- (i) The principle of the &quot;rate for the job &quot; should apply to .alllocally recruited labour working side by side in the same establishment.Discrimination based on differences in living costs within such a group of workers,,even where they can be proved to exist, is contrary to our usual labour policy:the criterion should be the wage level obtaining in the place of work. The presentsituation in Gibraltar is also inconsonant with international practice where nationals of one country cross a frontier to work in another: it would be hard to defendif the matter were raised at the I.L.O. &quot; Good &quot; private employers in Gibraltardo not discriminate against Spaniards in favour of Gibraltarians but pay them thesame rate.(ii) If the cost of living has to be admitted as an argument, it is open to doubt whether there is any significant difference between the cost of living in gibraltar and the Campo area on which the differential can be justified. Indeed, an enquirymade in 1954 showed that if travelling costs were included there was probably no difference. Since that time the cost of living has increased in Spain; in Gibraltaron the other hand the cost-of-living index fell between 1952 and 1954, and on thebasis of a new index introduced in 1954 rose by only 3 per cent, between June 1954and August 1955. If the present trend in Spain continues as it probably will the cost of living in Spain may soon be higher than that in Gibraltar: a decisionto pin allowances to the cost-of-living index would then, if the differential were maintained, place us under an obligation to pay the Spaniards more thanGibraltarians.
(iii) Her Majesty&apos;s Government need to provide themselves with a sound basis for representations to the Spanish Government about the supply of labour to gibraltar. If the present restrictions are continued the Spanish labour force willbe substantially depleted within five years; and the cost of housing alternativeforeign labour to replace the Spaniards would be at least  11  million and wouldhave to be started within the next few years. There can.be no guarantee that theSpanish restrictions will be removed if we remove the differential. But it is virtuallycertain that if the differential remains no representations by us will persuade theSpanish Government to raise or seriously modify their restrictions.9. Conclusions. (i) The Cabinet has already recognised that the differentialshould not be allowed to remain as at present. It is indefensible in itself and a continuous source of mischief by the Spaniards.(ii) The pinning of the allowances to the actual difference between living costs in Gibraltar and Spain would be an unsatisfactory solution in view of the constantlyrising cost of living in Spain and might expose us to an eventual obligation to paySpaniards more than Gibraltarians.(iii) Restrictions on the supply of Spanish labour, if continued, must soonconfront us with the need for heavy expenditure in Gibraltar. Our willingness to abolish the differential is likely to be an essential condition for any agreement to dismantle these restrictions.10. The Foreign Office and the Colonial Office therefore consider that ministers should be invited to agree to the abolition of the differential in theconditions proposed in paragraph 1.1 below. If they are not prepared to endorsethis recommendation, then it is felt that, any solution short of complete abolitionshould include acceptance of the principle that there should in future be no discrimination which cannot be justified by a demonstrable difference between theCost of living in Spain and Gibraltar. Should this principle be accepted, it is recommended-(i) That it should be announced that we intend to investigate whether and,if so, to what extent a differential is justified by the present costs ofliving in Gibraltar and Spain; and that any part of the existingdifferential that is not clearly justified will be abolished. A date shouldbe announced by which it is proposed to complete this action.(ii) That Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Madrid should inform the SpanishGovernment of our intentions before the investigation is announced.It is stressed, however, that such a compromise would hold less chance of securingSpanish co-operation and may not in the long run save money.11. Ministers are at present considering the negotiation of a Social InsuranceAgreement between the United Kingdom, on behalf of Gibraltar, and Spain.During those negotiations an effort will be made to secure an understanding with spain over the flow of labour into Gibraltar, but at present we have little or nothing to offer the Spaniards, by way of inducement. It might, however, in the opinionof Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid, just be possible to obtain an understandingsatisfactory to Gibraltar if the United Kingdom negotiators were able to indicate a change of policy in respect of the differential. In that case we consider that weshould be making a good bargain. It is therefore recommended that, should oneof the recommendations made above be accepted, our negotiators should beauthorised to announce the decision in respect of the differential only if, in theirOpinion, this is likely to persuade the Spanish authorities to come to an understanding with us on the flow of labour. If the Spaniards show themselvesintransigent on the question of labour supply and appear unlikely to be moved by anything that we ourselves do, then the decision in respect of the differentialwill not be given effect until circumstances appear more favourable.
