Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1956SECRET Copy No.   5 6CP. (56) 24019th October, 1956CABINETMIGRATION POLICY: EMPIRE SETTLEMENT ACTS, 1922-52Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations the Empire Settlement Act, 1952, expires on 31st May, 1957, and, if it isnot replaced, there will cease to be legislative authority for United Kingdomcontributions after that date either towards the Australian Assisted Passage scheme or towards the maintenance of child migrants in Australia and Southern Rhodesia.This matter has been considered in recent months by the Oversea Migration Boardand&apos; by an official Inter-Departmental Committee. Both have recommendedrenewing our contribution to the Australian Assisted Passage Scheme and continuing assistance to the voluntary organisations concerned with child migration.2. I propose therefore that a Bill should be introduced and passed before31st May, 1957, to extend the Empire Settlement Acts for a further five years, i.e.,until 31st May, 1962. I annex a note setting out the facts and arguments in favourof this course.3. The current agreements with the voluntary organisations which arrange the migration of children also expire on 31st May, 1957. I recommend that these should be renewed, provided that the organisations undertake to modernise theirmethods of child care in Australia and to bring them more into line with thoseaccepted in this country.H.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W. 1,17th October, 1956.AnnexEMPIRE  SETTLEMENT  ACTS,   1922-52,  AND   SCHEMES   MADETHEREUNDERThe Present position the Empire Settlement Acts, 1922, 1937 and 1952, empower theCommonwealth Secretary to make contributions to &quot; Empire Settlement&quot;schemes up to a maximum of  1,500,000 a year, &quot; in association with theGovernment of any part of His Majesty&apos;s Dominions, or with public authorities or public or private organisations either in the United Kingdom or in any partof such Dominions.&quot; These Acts are due to expire on 31st May, 1957. Before thewar a large number of schemes were operated under the Acts, and United Kingdomexpenditure on them fluctuated considerably, the maximum figure being  1,280,000in 1927.    Since the war fewer schemes have been brought into being so that50665
expenditure has been less, the maximum figure reached being  899,000 in 1950-51.At present the only schemes operated under the Acts are those described inparagraphs 2 and 3.The Australian Assisted Passage Scheme2. The Australian Assisted Passage Scheme has been in operation since march, 1947, and some 200,000 men, women and children have sailed under it.Up to 31st March, 1956, United Kingdom contributions towards the costs of theScheme totalled over  3 millions. At first the costs, less the contributions paidby the migrants, were shared equally by the United Kingdom and australian government. However, subsequent deterioration in the United Kingdom&apos;financial situation led to successive reductions in the United Kingdom contribution,until in 1952 it was fixed at its present figure of  150,000 a year. The Scheme isdue to expire in March, 1957 and, although the Australian Government have notyet expressed their views, it may safely be assumed that they will be anxious tosee it extended for a further period. They still attach great importance toimmigration as a means of building up the population of Australia and have repeatedly expressed their preference for migrants from the United Kingdom.Child Migration3. For many years there have been in existence agreements made under theEmpire Settlement Acts between the Commonwealth Secretary and various childmigration organisations. At present agreements with 9 such organisations governadmission of migrant children to 39 farm schools, homes and other institutions inAustralia and Southern Rhodesia. All these agreements provide for the payment by the United Kingdom Government of 10s. a week towards the maintenance ofeach child under 16 years of age. Six of the agreements also provide for the UnitedKingdom Government to pay,  4 towards the cost of an outfit for each child. Theagreements will all expire on 31st May, 1957. Since the war some 2,700 childrenhave migrated under these arrangements. The present expenditure from UnitedKingdom funds is of the order of  36,000 a year. Child migration to Australia wasinvestigated earlier this year by a Government-appointed Fact-Finding Missionwhose Report was published in August (Cmd. 9832).Renewal of the Empire Settlement Acts4. From the budgetary standpoint, the Acts should be renewed if new agreements are to be made which involve a financial commitment extendingbeyond the period covered by the annual estimates. Although the existing&apos; childmigration agreements have been renewed from year to year since 1954, it isdesirable for agreements of this type, and the Australian Assisted PassageAgreement, to run for 2 or 3 years at a time, to enable the organisation and theAustralian Government to plan ahead. If the existing Australian Assisted PassageAgreement and child migration agreements are not renewed, there will still remain a moral liability for maintenance payments for the children already sent toAustralia and Southern Rhodesia until they reach the age of 16. This would taperoff over about 10 years from the present figure of  36,000.5. The Acts have been on the Statute Book since 1922, and failure to renewthem would be interpreted, both here and overseas, as a change of policy and achange of heart, even if no change were intended. The Acts are only permissive.It is therefore recommended that a Bill to renew the&apos; Empire Settlement Actsshould be introduced in the 1956-57 session in time to receive the Royal Assentbefore 31st May, 1957.6. Although expenditure under the Acts in any one year has never reachedthe limit laid down, any attempt to reduce the limit would give rise to criticism that the Government were unsympathetic to emigration. Moreover, with rising prices, the present figure of  1+ millions does not mean as much now as it did in1937, or even 1952, and it would be wise to allow a substantial margin over thehighest figure ( 899,000) spent in the past 15 years. It is accordingly recommendedthat the maximum figure to be included in the new Bill should be the same as before,i.e.,  A\ millions. The Treasury, however, would prefer that the annual limit should &quot;be no higher than  500,000, on the grounds that in the past five yearsexpenditure has averaged about  270,000 and is at present at the annual rate of only about  200,000.
7. The 1922 and .1937 Acts had a duration of 15 years, and a similar period for the new Bill might be an earnest of the Governments genuine belief in thebenefits of migration to the Commonwealth. However, it is difficult to see so far ahead, and it may be considered unwise to fix the Governments migration activitiesfor so long a period, in case conditions in the meantime improve, and a more activepolicy becomes possible or even necessary. It is therefore suggested that the newBill, like the 1952 Act, should have a duration of 5 years. The Ministry of labour would prefer to see the Acts extended for 15 years, and hold the view that extendingthem for no more than 5 years would make the new Bill appear to be anotherinterim measure suggesting impermanence and uncertainty in the Governmentsmigration policy.Renewal of the Australian Assisted Passage Agreement8. Against Government subsidisation of emigration may be argued our ownmanpower shortages and a doubt whether the United Kingdom contribution hasany significant effect on the numbers emigrating. It is, moreover, not whollyappropriate nowadays that one independent Member of the Commonwealth shouldsubsidise emigration to another. On the other hand, a strong Australia, continuing to be predominantly of British stock, is of great strategic and economic importanceto us. Furthermore, the Australian immigration policy has been followed by allAustralian Governments and is supported by most Australians, and to stop theUnited Kingdom contribution would cause resentment and a strain in relationsbetween the two countries. An incidental advantage of our contribution is that itenables us to keep some check on Australian recruiting of immigrants in thiscountry. It is therefore recommended that if, as may be expected, the australian government approach the United Kingdom Government to renew the assisted passage Agreement, we should accede to their request.9. If the Agreement is renewed, the Australian Government would undoubtedly like to see the United Kingdom contribution increased above 150,000 a year. For this reason, it would be difficult to secure a further reduction,and an attempt to do so might also lead to the political difficulties described inparagraph 8. It is therefore recommended that, if the Agreement is renewed on thesame lines as at present, the United Kingdom Government should be prepared to renew their contribution of  150,000 a year. It would appear that no practical alternative to a money contribution by the United Kingdom Government can atpresent be devised.Renewal of the Child Migration Agreements10. The Fact-Finding Mission&apos;s Report referred to in paragraph 3 contains a number of criticisms of the arrangements made by the voluntary organisations concerned with child migration in Australia. These criticisms are at present beingconsidered in consultation with the Australian authorities and in the light ofcomments by the voluntary organisations, but, whatever the outcome of this consideration, it is unlikely to warrant the discontinuance of the present well-established system of child migration to Australia. The system has existed with government support both in Australia and the United Kingdom for over 30 years,has influential support from churches and prominent laymen in both countries,and, by most accounts, has benefited the children who have made use of it. It is recommended that the agreements with the voluntary organisations concerned withchild migration to Australia should be renewed when they expire on 31st May, 1957,on the understanding that the organisations undertake to modernise their methodsof child care and to bring their arrangements in Australia more into line with thoseaccepted in the United Kingdom. Since we in this country cannot make sure, inthe ordinary way, whether those undertakings are honoured, we shall have to persuade the Australian authorities to take over the responsibility. similar arrangements will not be necessary in the case of Southern Rhodesia since theorganisation concerned with child migration to that country has decided inagreement with the Southern Rhodesian authorities, not to send any more childrenthere after January, 1957. Those children already there will continue to be eligiblefor United Kingdom maintenance payments whilst they are under the age of16 years.Commonwealth Relations Office,17th October, 1956.
