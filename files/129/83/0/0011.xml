BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONREVIEW OF FINANCIAL SITUATION222, Marylebone Road, N.W.I.SEPTEMBER, 1956.
BRITISH TRANSPORT COMMISSIONREVIEW OF FINANCIAL SITUATIONCHAPTER I  j  INTRODUCTIONOn 19th March, 1956, the Minister of transport and Civil Aviation made a statement in the House of Commonsabout&apos; the British Transport Commissions charges.      TheCommission had shortly before this date made an applicationto the Minister for an increase in their freight charges,and&apos;to the Transport Tribunal for an increase in certainpassenger charges and had also announced a proposed increaseof further passenger charges which were within their ownauthority.     Briefly, the Minister informed the House that whereas it was Government policy that nationalised industries,in fixing their charges, should seek fully to reflect theircosts, the special position and further outlook relating tothe Commission^ affairs justified the Government in asking the Commission, in the national interest, to follow acourse which would involve an exception to this generalpolicy.     The increases for which the Commission had appliedor which they intended to bring into force were, therefore,reduced or postponed for a period of six months, duringwhich a fresh assessment of the Commissions position and prospects would be undertaken to be followed by such specialaction as seemed appropriate at the end of that period.    Itwas on this clear understanding that the Commission had agreed to the course proposed.Accordingly the Commission have now reviewedonce again the financial prospects of their undertaking andin particular the economics of the Modernisation Plan forthe railways.     This document sets out the results of the irreview.Throughout the review and in estimating thefuture margin between revenue and expenditure the commission have, of necessity, framed their forecasts on the basis ofthe present value of money and a continuance of current economic conditions.     They have also had to base themselves on certain assumptions about other matters outside their control, the major assumptions being as follows :-(a) That the Commission will not be prevented fromadjusting their charges without delay at anytime to cover increases in costs, should theyconsider it expedient to do so.(b) That the Commission will be free to operate onflexible systems of charging and to determineon a reasonable basis the scale and scope ofthe services to be provided.(c) That the necessary resources of all kinds willbe available to enable the Commission, inco-operation with industry, to carry out their Plan for the Modernisation andRe-equipment  of British Railways accordingto programme.
(d) That the Government policy regarding the framework within which the Commissionoperate will remain as at present,(in making this assumption for the.purpose of this review the Commissionreserve their right to make separaterepresentations on such matters).(e) That special action will toe taken as soonas possible which will permit theCommission to preserve an atmosphere of proper financial discipline through-out their affairs;    it follows that financial targets must toe set which are reasonably possible of achievement inthe circumstances, tout which contain noelement of subsidy.
CHAPTER II    5    THE FINANCIAL PROBLEM4. The Commission have earned a working surplus inevery year since they &quot;began operations.     On the otherhand, in several of these years the surplus earned was not sufficient to meet the financial charges on the fixed-interest &quot;borrowings, which constitute virtually theCommission^ sole source of external capital.     Therigidity thus imposed on the Commission&apos;s financial policy is relaxed to some extent, however, by a provision in the 191+7 Act which allows the Commission to &quot;take oneyear with another&quot; in &quot;balancing their accounts.     It wasalso intended that the Commission should build up generalreserves which would be used to smooth out those yearlyfluctuations of profit and loss which are inherent in aeapital structure based purely on fixed interest borrow-in gs , but the Commission started without such reserves and never obtained increases in fares and charges large enough to permit their creation.5. The finances of the railways have, moreover,been considerably affected by the control over capital investment, the consequences of which are likely to depress their competitive power for some years to come.The restrictions placed on the replacement of out-of-daterolling stock, buildings and equipment have been particularlysevere.     They have led to excessive maintenance costs andthe delays in overcoming war-time arrears have meant thatthe special reserves inherited to finance these arrears at1947 prices proved to be quite inadequate at the pricesruling when the work was put in hand.     Even more importanthas been the effect on efficiency, involving higher running costs and in some instances loss of traffic to competitorswhose equipment was more up-to-date.6.followsEven so,Working Surpluses have been earned as19481949195019511952195319541955 m.45.231 .340.049.153.859.445.529.5Against these surpluses, the Central Charges, mainly thefinancial charges already mentioned for remuneration ofcapital, have averaged about  50m. a year, with atendency to rise in later years principally because ofthe need to replace assets booked at pre-war values byassets purchased at  the new levels of cost.     However,leaving out a bad period in the late months of 1949 andthe early months of 1950, when there were special delays in dealing with charging policy after the devaluation ofthe pound sterling, the Commission were more or less in balance over the first seven years of their existence,that is, they were remunerating their capital practicallyin full;    it was only the exceedingly poor results in 1955
which prompted the view that one could no longer expect the lean years to &quot;be safely recouped out of the betterones in the future, with the level of. the. accumulated deficit kept to negligible proportions in consequence.The financial shortfall of the year 1955 was attributable to special causes rather than to anyinherent weakness in the economics of the Commission&apos;saffairs.     The railway strike lost the Commission^ about 12m;    there was a lapse of several months in putting upcharges which cost  10m:    and there were sudden increases in prices (chiefly coal) immediately after the process of re-adjusting the charges was completed, which cost theCommission about  5m. in the calendar year.      If these special items, totalling  27m., are added to the actualworking surplus of  29i-m. for the year, it will be seenthat even the year 1955? though it was a year of financialunbalance, was not a year of fundamental economic weakness.Nevertheless there were growing indications, as the yearclosed, that the Commission^ finances were being very seriously strained under existing circumstances.Early in 1956 the position deteriorated further,and possibly it changed in nature.     Certainly the back-ground .changed, and with the general drive throughout  thecountry to halt further increases in the price of basicgoods and services, it became doubtful whether the lastgeneral increase in transport wages could or should berecouped forthwith in higher transport  charges.     on railways in particular the general merchandise trafficcontinued to decline, partly because they were notequipped to improve their standards of service in step with their ccompetitors.      In the event, it was decided, as already mentioned, that it was expedient to limit theamount and nature of the proposed increases in transport charges for six months, and to use this period for makinga review of the whole position.     Allowing for the increases in charges which vi/ere authorised, the Commission were left with a gap in their budget of the order of  35m. a year.Since that date there have been certain further increases in costs and other changes in the position which mean thatthe probable rate of deficit is about  h5m. a year.The accumulated deficit at the end of 1955 was already  70m.     This was due mainly to time lags in putting up fares and charges, largely on traffics such as themovement of London passengers, rather than to any inherentweakness in the competitive fields.     By the end of thisyear, however, the accumulated deficit will be of theorder of  120m., assuming no further increases in wages orother costs, and it is important to realise what theposition will be in a few years&apos; time if appropriate measures are not taken.      It is not merely that there willbe a steady addition of further and growing deficits,mainly from the operation of British Railways, but also from the operation of London Transport and Inland Waterways.To allow the budget to remain unbalanced will haveconsequences almost more serious in undermining financialdiscipline within the organisation, and to rely in effecton indefinite subsidy would be disastrous to the self-respect of the undertaking, to their urge tov/ardsefficiency, and to the basis of their relations with
I other parties.     The total deficit carried forward would reach unmanageable proportions, and ultimately a defaultupon the Commission^ obligations would be inescapable.The effect of suoh a course of events on the services provided to the trader and the travelling public neednot be underlined.10. . This is the potential magnitude of the problem in the absence of remedial measures.     It has not been created by a mere decision to restrict increases in charges for a brief period, nor can it be dispelled bythe simple expedient of discarding all restraint incharging policy.     The Commission have taken, and aretaking, the measures outlined in Chapters IV and VI below,and on the assumptions previously mentioned the commission are confident that these measures will ultimately restore the financial position provided that means can be foundto enable the Commission to keep the situation underproper control during the next few years of reconstruction and development.     The question of dealing with thisperiod is examined in Chapter VII, and the Commissionsubmit that it should be tackled with decision andurgency.     They present in this paper evidence to show,that it is not a matter of rescuing a moribund concernfrom rain, but of enabling one with a sound, even bright,future to pass through this difficult period without being thrown into hopeless disarray.
CHAPTER III    :    THE ROLE OF THE RAILWAYS11. The railways represent the preponderant part ofthe Commission&apos;s undertaking and the problem of finding abasis for the profitable operation of British Railways is vital to the Commission.     The same problem faces trans-port administrations abroad where it has been generally accepted that the railways have an essential part to play.It is significant that most rf the Western european nations gave priority to railway reconstruction in theirpost war plans.12. The fact that serious financial problems besetthe railways in many countries today must be largelyascribed to the difficulties which these railways haveencountered in their endeavours to adapt themselves tothe changing pattern of industrial economy and society.Some of these difficulties can be ascribed to statutory requirements;    some to public unreadiness to appreciate the full consequences of the emergence of alternative forms of transport;    some to attempts to preserve ..traffics which are uneconomic or better suited to other forms of transport;    and some to restrictions on capital development or to public reluctance to invest.13* The need for railways, their role in future andthe tasks assigned to the railway system as a whole, andin its individual parts, must be constantly reviewed inthe light of local circumstances and of changing conditions;but there are two main criteria &quot;indispensability&quot; and&quot;economy&quot;.     A service may be. classed as indispensablebecause the traffic can be moved in no other way;    or itmay be needed as an essential relief to roads;    or theremay be no other means of sufficiently fast transit overlong distances.      By contrast, services may be desirablebecause, of all the alternatives, they are the most economic either in terms of cost to the customer or in use of national resources.1U. A very large part of the railway track mileagein the great conurbations like London, Glasgow, SouthLancashire and Birmingham is primarily used for the urban and suburban passenger services.     These services carryabout 1-g- million passengers daily, mainly to and fromtheir work, in brief and exceedingly heavy surges.    Theyaccount fcr about one half of the annual total of 1 ,000million passengers on British Railways.      The roads couldnot physically cope with such surges.     The railwaysalone can give the concentrated leading, the strict control and the timing which make these movementspossible.     A railway can deal with a throughput of atleast 20,000 persons an hcur for each track and a largecity terminus may handle over 100,000 persons cn a busymorning.     Moreover, the public travel at higher speedsover rather longer distances, and in safer circumstances,than obtain sn the roads.      Clearly there is no alterna-tive to these railway services, although they tend to be expensive to provide and relatively unremunerative.
15. On the other hand, the longer distance passengertraffics account for a lesser number of passengers, butthe passenger miles and the average fare per passengercarried are much greater and the services are profitable.The railway cost per seat mile on such services is much lower than the comparable road cost and, even allowing for the greater carrying capacity which the railwayshave to maintain to cope with surges and with seasonalfluctuations in traffic, the train can still operate atfares which attract the public and leave a profit.Moreover, these long distance services offer speed andcomfort as well as such convenience as the night sleeperservices.     They also provide facilities for the carriage of mails, newspapers, perishables and specialparcel traffics, which alone bring in nearly  50 million a year.16. There is no practicable road alternative tothese long distance train services, and a sign of thefuture may be seen in the growing popularity of the&quot;car sleeper&quot; services over the trunk routes, by whichthe passenger and his car are transported together.17* In between the urban and suburban services andthe long distance traffics, there are the rural and&quot;feeder&quot; passenger services.     Here the role of therailway is less certain and it is here that the greatestchanges are to be expected.     The bus is often a cheaperand more expeditious method of handling these traffics,and the private car is a still more convenient means.Many of these rail services have been running at a lossfor a long time and present a problem which is discussed in a later section of this  review.     Any plan forrefashioning the railway system to suit modern transportconditions must first explore alternative methods of operation.     Thereafter, those services which cannot possibly be made economic by modern rail methods andwhich can be better catered for by road transport mustbe eliminated.18. For freight traffic, a railway is a highlyeconomic means of transport when the flow of traffic is heavy enough and steady enough to permit of its being handled in regular trains of vehicles with onlyone motive unit and crew, rather than in individualvehicles each with its own power and crew, provided always that no costly terminal handlings or tranship-ments are involved in getting the traffic from door todoor.19* Regular bulk mineral traffics such as coal,coke and iron ore are usually carried far more cheaplyand conveniently, even over short distances, by railthan by road.     Nearly 1,000 tons of bulk freight canbe moved by a train crew of no more than three men.For such traffics, which are still increasing, railways are the economic form of transport, and,the introductionof large wagons with continuous brakes will make these services still more &quot;economic&quot;.     The railways are also&quot;indispensable&quot; for these traffics, many of which are
basic to the economy of the country, for it is probablethat for various reasons, including the type of terminalfacility required, many of them would find it hard touse the road.20. Every day, in total, British Railways haul some60 million ton-miles of freight for their customers,and their flexibility enables them to deal with suchgreat surges as the coal mined in &quot;bull weeks&quot; and the big harvest movements.     It would&apos;be manifestlyimpossible to transfer these traffics to road, especially when   big surges are involved, without bringing movementon the roads, at least in the big industrial areas, to a standstill.     In the ports, also, both import and exporttraffic must increasingly be handled by rail if con-gestion is to be reduced, as the recent report of the ports Efficiency Committee has emphasised.21. While there are, of course, traffics, especiallymerchandise, which are well suited to road transport for economic reasons, the railways still have anessential function in providing the customer with afast, reliable and individual service for generalmerchandise traffic.     The full potentialities of therailway system for cheap and safe movement of manufacturedgoods in the modern age lies in the solution of theproblem of transhipment between road and rail through theuse of containers and special equipment or even vehiclesinterchangeable between road and rail, and In the develop-ment of road-served railheads.22. In general it can be said that in the UnitedKingdom, unlike the United States, the passenger services in themselves, prove the necessity for therailways.     The contrast is brought home when it is realised that the Southern Region carry annually almost the same number of passengers as all the Class Irailways of the United States.     The railways are, andwill remain, the ideal method of transport for carryinglarge numbers of people to and from their work andwithout them a great part of the essential daily and business travel of the country and the big seasonalmovements of holiday makers and others would be virtually impossible.     But the railways are also indispensable to a great part of the basic freight traffics.      Theyare essential for bulk freight and are the indispensableally of other forms of movement in meeting the totaltransport requirements of the country.     Finally, thev;value of the railways to national defence, or in emergency, must not be overlooked.     Thus, despite the enormous and rapid growth of road and air transport,the railways will always, as far as can be foreseen,.be a vital part of the country&apos;s transport system.23&apos; Given the existing framework of regulation,the British Transport Commission are tackling theproblem of achieving a profitable basis for theoperation of British Railways under four principalheadings  :-
(a) Modernisation.(b) Elimination of services for which thereis no longer public need or which canbe more efficiently performed by other means of transport, and development ofthe remaining services.( c) Increased productivity.(d) Relaxation of statutory and other obligations, particularly theintroduction of greater freedom in fixing fares and charging policy.These measures are outlined in succeeding chapters anda forecast is given of the extent to which they willredress the present financial position.
CHAPTER IV    ;    CORRECTIVE ACTION IN PROGRESS -RAILWAYS _;A.    MODERNISATIONThe aim of the Plan for the Modernisation andRe-equipment of British Railways may he simply stated :-The Commission are determined to exploit the opportunities for re-equipment which modernscience and techniques present, and totransform the operations of British Railwaysso as to offer the public a rail servicesecond to none, whilst deriving from the equipment the full economic benefit it can provide.Continuous study has been given to all aspects of operation, and lines of development- have been establishedwhich will adjust the patterns of the passenger and freight services to the probable requirements of thefuture.     The Plan is spread over fifteen years;    it isconceived as an integrated whole, and is not properlyremunerati7/-e unless treated as such, but in its detailit is nevertheless flexible.      It is already well underway;    a few projects are already complete, and a greatvolume of work is now in progress which will be completed,and begin to fructify, in a few years&apos;  time.Passenger Traffic&apos; The principal objectives of the Plan for improving the rail passenger services are :-(a) To make still faster and safer the long distance services of British Railways andto make them more comfortable, clean andpunctual, thereby enhancing theircompetitive power and profitability.(b) To complete the electrification of most of thevery intense urban and suburban services inthe major centres of population, and toprovide faster and more frequent dieselsuburban and inter urban train services where electrification cannot be carried out.(c) To recast entirely the form of the feeder and secondary line services by substituting forthe infrequent stopping steam train a smaller,cheaper and more attractive diesel or electricunit.     This will eliminate one of the mostserious drains on the economy of the railway system, whilst providing at the same time an improved service.The principal means of attaining the objectives lies in the elimination of steam and thesubstitution of modern forms of traction.      Theadoption of diesel and electric traction will lead to higher average speeds, punctuality and cleanliness.New timetables, designed to exploit the capacity of
K 9J eldiesel and electric trains to cover large mileageswithout attention, will reduce operating costs whilstproviding greater frequency of services.     Theultimate aim is for long distance main line passengertrains at average speeds of 75 m.p.h. between stopswhere track conditions allow and where economicallyjustified.      In this connection, it is noteworthy thatthe number of passenger trains in 1956 with scheduledstart-to-stop speeds of over 60 m.p.h. is 58 comparedwith 20 in 1953.27. Further, rail travel will be made more attractive by improvements in the amenities providedfor passengers.     New coaching stock is being designed and prototypes are now being constructed.     These willprovide for higher standards of comfort and decoration,Improved heating, lighting and ventilation, and reduction of noise.     At the same time, stations willbe modernised, road access and parking facilitiesimproved and better arrangements made for issuingtickets and reserving seats.28. The first fruits of modernisation have alreadybeen seen in the introduction of diesel multiple unitvehicles of which nearly 300 are in use in various partsof the country.     Wherever they have been brought into service, there has been ample evidence of publicappreciation.     The extent of the popularity of the newdiesel services can be gauged from the followingexamples of increases in traffic since their introduction:-Percentage IncreaseService Inaugurated     Journeys   ReceiptsLeeds-Bradford-Harrogate	14.	6.54	144	100Carlisle-Silloth	29.	11 .54	66	44Oarlisle-Whi t ehaven	7.	2.55	44	62Garlisle-Penrith-Workington	3.	1 .55	84	104King&apos;s Lynn-Wells-Norwich	19.	9.55	40	30Bi rmingham-Li chfi eld	5.	3.56	210	208Bury-Bacup	6.	2.56.	132	16429. Orders already placed cater for the provisionof 2,400 multiple unit diesel vehicles by the end of1958 for use on services throughout the country.     Theproposed services are shown in some detail in Appendix A.They include inter city services between Edinburgh andGlasgow and between Birmingham and Swansea, as well as other services between important centres such as Londonand Hastings;    Glasgow and Girvan.      Suburban dieselservices are proposed in South Wales;    the Bristol and birmingham areas;    the West Riding;    Tees-side and forthe Manchester and Nottingham areas;    and branchservices are projected in East Anglia, North Wales,
Hampshire and Cumberland.     The total number of dieselmultiple unit vehicles allowed for in the plan is /+56OO,all of which should be in use by the end of 1961.Planning is now in hand for the use of those to bointroduced after 1958.     For example, the London MidlandRegion propose diesel services connecting Liverpool,Leeds and Bradford, and Birmingham,, Liverpool and manchester;    and the North Eastern Region are engagedwith the other Regions concerned in planning the Leeds-Liverpool and Hull-Liverpool services.30. Plans are also well advanced for the introductionof a small diesel rail car specially suited to branchlines and other stopping services in rural areas, where,if traffic by rail is to continue, the highest degree of operating economy must be practised.31* A third type of diesel train is envisaged,offering high speed and special amenities.    Accordingly,plans are being developed for the introduction of de luxemultiple   unit diesel expresses to operate at high speedon selected services between important cities.     these will incorporate all that is best in modern design forthe comfort and convenience of the traveller.32, The programme for electrification is outlined in Appendix A, from which it will be seen that electrical -fication on the main lines between Euston, manchester and Liverpool, and King&apos;s Cross, Leeds and York, willnot be completed until the later stages of the Planhave been reached.      This is inevitable in view of thegreat mass of engineering work they comprise.   Dieseltraction will, to some extent, span the gap, and electric traction will be brought in, in stages, assections are completed.33. Work is well under way in the other elcctrifi-cation schemes.      In January, 1957? the extension fromShenfield to Southend will be completed, and during theperiod between i960 and 1962, many new electrified lineswill have come into service, including the extensions tothe Kent Coast,&apos;the Glasgow suburban lines, the LondonTilbury and Southend Line and the Enfield, Chingford,Hertford and Bishop Stortford branch.3U. The financial results of all these measures in connection with passenger traffic will be decisive.The investment in diesel multiple unit trains forstopping services is expected to result in immediate and very great savings.     Economies will also be madeon the suburban services, and the profitability of thelong distance services will be enhanced.   All in all,a total improvement of some  30m. a year may be predicted with confidence as the eventual outcome.This is hardly surprising whon it is remembered thatthere are the technical developments of twenty years to gather in.
Freight traffic the main objectives for the modernised freightservices are reliability;    speed;    and economic operation.These will be achieved by ;-(a) speeding up the services by providing allwagons with continuous brakes;(b) eliminating delays by providing new and extending existing marshalling yards;(o) building the largest wagons consistent with the requirements of trade andindustry;(d) reducing the number of stations dealingwith freight business by concentrating on modernised railheads, operated inconjunction with radial road services;(e) increasing the use of containers and othermodern devices for rapid transfer of loadsbetween road and rail without handling the goods;(f) developing mechanised handling methods tothe maximum extent.By these means it will be possible to obtain a quickerturn round of wagons, greater carrying capacity, and inconsequence a substantial reduction in the wagon fleet.Further, by offering traders a faster and more reliableservice, and by taking advantage of the new charges scheme, more traffic will be attracted to rail.The development of freight train operation,to be both efficient and economic, requires acceleration of timings, regularity of service and greater utilisation-tion of motive power and rolling stock.     One of themore important contributions to these aims is the fittingof    the continuous brake to all freight rolling stock.Details of the programme for the introduction of thevacuum brake are.given in Appendix A.     By 1955 about181,1+00 wagons, one-sixth of the total fleet, had beenfitted with continuous brakes.      Over the next ten years,brakes will be fitted to new and existing wagons at separately of over 60,000 a year.     This programme will bring a rapid increase in the number of braked trains, whichshould lead to a steady improvement in .the efficiency of both freight and passenger train operation byeliminating the delaying effect of the slow, unbrakedgoods train.     The freight train of the future will normally travel at speeds up to 60 m.p.h,, with improvedpunctuality and in greater safety.The Plan provides for the elimination of manyold marshalling yards and t heir replacement by a smaller number of modern yards provided with mechanised brakingequipment and advanced communication systems.     Apartfrom the direct savings resulting from the increased efficiency of operation within the yards, considerablebenefits will accrue from the closing of old andinefficient yards and the speeding up of traffic.
38. Surveys in progress of the general pattern of freight operation throughout the country have led upto now to the construction of new marshalling yardsbeing put in hand at Temple Mills and Ripple Lane onthe Eastern Region, Thornton and Millerhill on the  -Scottish Region, and Margam and Severn Tunnel Junctionon the Western Region.39. Eighty-eight per cent, of the total freighttonnage carried by British Railways originates from private sidings and this includes practically all thecoal traffic.     Fifty-eight per cent, of the totalfreight tonnage is delivered to private sidings,including half of the coal traffic.     The sidingsthemselves, and the loading arrangements they servelimit the size, type and laden weight of the wagonsthat use them.     This influence goes far to account for the small size of mineral and general merchandisewagons in use in Britain.     In seeking solutions to theproblem of increasing the pay load of rail wagons,attention is being focussed on higher capacity wagons.Wherever regular flows of traffic justify, and localconditions permit, the use of wagons of kO and 50-toncapacity working in regular circuits, these are being introduced.     The movement of iron ore from Tyne Dockto Consett in 56-ton self-discharging wagons is an illustration.     For other movements of minerals, thenew 2k^-ton wagon is proving its worth and over 2,500of them are already in service.     The production of the16-ton general service all-steel mineral wagon will be discontinued in favour of a wagon of 21/22-ton capacity which is being designed for services to terminals unable,by reason of their size, to accept the 2ki-ton wagons.Similarly, new vehicles fitted for air discharge arebeing introduced for special traffics such as cement,and an intensive drive is being made into the means of attracting to rail transport bricks, sheet steel andbulk traffics of a similar nature.i+0. Terminal costs for freight traffic, which include terminal haulage, shunting and marshalling,absorb some luD per cent, of present rail costs(excluding track) in the case of full-wagon loads, and nearly 70 per cent, in the case of less-than-wagon loadtraffic where goods have to be sorted for forwarding.A recent analysis taken during one week of traffic ata selection of typical stations has shown that 60 percent, of them dealt with less than twenty wagons duringthe p period.U1. There are, therefore, conclusive arguments forclosing many goods stations and the concentration of rail freight at a smaller number of modern freightterminals served by road and equipped with mechanicalhandling equipment.     These freight terminals will be served by fast trains.     Direct services will be operated, wherever possible, to keep time losses inmarshalling trains to a minimum.
Much preparatory work in the development ofthe new freight terminals is in hand.      In the EasternRegion, schemes for modernisation at Lincoln, Grimsbyand Peterborough have been approved and work hascommenced on a new railhead depot at Ripple Lane, nearBarking.      In the London Midland Region, schemes for newgoods terminals are in preparation for Manchester,Stoke, Birmingham and London (Dudding Hill).      In theSouthern Region, plans are in hand for the developmentof a new depot at Crawley.     Similar developments inother Regions are in hand for Newcastle, Stockton,Dundee, Merthyr and Plymouth.The movement of traffic to and from the portshas been under close examination, and representativesof the Federation of British Industries, together withrepresentatives of the Commission, are engaged in determining means of avoiding the serious road con-gestion near the principal ports, by diverting some ofthe business to rail.     A special depot has been opened in the Birmingham area for the reception of smallconsignments and their subsequent loading in throughwagons to the ports with a &quot;Green Arrow&quot; assurance of delivery.Freight terminals cater for the transfer fromone form of transport to another:    between road and rail.The simplification of this transfer to suit the needs of^the consignor or consignee and to accelerate transit isone of the basic problems of freight movement.     For fullloads the objective is to develop new types of containersor demountable bodies which can be swiftly and mechanicallytransferred between road and rail vehicles, so eliminating the handling of the goods.     The new containers willcater for higher pay loads and will be of lighter con-struction than the older types.     Freight terminal design,layout and equipment will match these new developments in layout of sidings, roadways, container parks and mechanical appliances.     Proposals for pilot schemes forthe handling of container traffic under modern conditionsare in course of preparation.  -The railways deal annually with many millions of small consignments, which are and will continue to bean integral part of the trade of the country.     Theassembly of small consignments into trunk haulage loadsinvolves handling operations costly in manpower.    these services will be highly mechanised.     Railheads for small consignments will be equipped with power operatedconveyor belts, stillages, power trucks and fork lifttrucks.     Plans for development of such terminals areactively in hand.The financial results of the f oregoing changesin freight transport will accrue more slowly than theresults on the passenger side.     Indeed, it was thoughtwhen the Plan was prepared that in the earliest stagesthe difficulties and dislocations of the changes to bemade wou3.d absorb all the immediate benefits.     However,the ultimate financial improvement on the present
position, resulting from freight modernisation, will hegreat, apart from the benefits to the customer of improved service, and is assessed at a minimum of  55m.a year.Financial effect of the Modernisation Flan,Taking into account the improvement of  30m,referred to in paragraph 3k the total improvement from both passenger and freight services is thus some  85m,This is before allowing for interest on the capitalinvolved.      The expected capital expenditures have been reviewed once more.     The total expenditure under thePlan when it was published was put at about  1,200m. andthe amount to be borrowed, allowing for internal sources of finance such as depreciation provisions, at about 800m.     These figures are now likely to be increased,though not greatly.     As to  the rate of interest on theborrowings, the Plan allowed for financial charges at per cent, per annum, and on past experience it may besupposed that the long-term rate of interest will, onthe average over the years, be less than this figure.On balance, there seems no reason to alter the annualcharge of  hOm. previously included in the Plan.As to the phrasing of the development programme,it   has been considerably accelerated since it was firstpublished and it is gathering momentum.     An indication of the probable progress is given in Appendix B.     As tothe financial benefit to be derived from these expend-itures., however, the inevitable delay between sowing andreaping will mean that during the first stage - theperiod to i960 or 1961 - the financial charges on theborrowings, added to the unidentifiable but unavoidablecosts of dislocation and disturbance, must be expectedto exceed the improvements in revenue.     After thisperiod, however, the gap will be eliminated and the finances of the Commission will be strengthened by arapidly increasing net benefit until, by 1970, a netbenefit of at least  k5w* should be available.It should perhaps be added that the commission are fully conscious that the physical processes of modernisation and development must be accompanied bysimilar adjustments in their organisation, methods andoutlook.      If at one time these intangible changes were thought to present greater difficulty, perhaps,  thanthe physical changes, the Commission are now glad toreport that there are already signs of a fresh out lookand a new determination which will be of decisiveimportance.
CHAPTER IV   (Continued)B.    ELIMINATION OF SERVICES FOR WHICH THERE ISNO LONGER PUBLIC NEED OR WHICH CAN BEFOREEFFICIENTLY PERFORMED BY OTHER J/JEANS OFTRANSPORT, AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE REMAININGRAILWAY SERVICES50. The operation by more economic means, or the elimination, of unremunerative passenger services is anessential feature of the Modernisation Plan and it ispertinent to examine the progress that has been made andthe results that may be expected.     It has to beremembered that British Railways, broadly speaking, weredeveloped a century before power-driven road transport.The latter, requiring no specialised track and with the single vehicle as its natural unit, is clearly superior to rail in convenience and cheapness of operation forshorter distance transport in thinly populated rural areas.     The Plan itself referred to &quot;purposefulconcentration on those functions which the Railways canbe made to perform more efficiently than other forms oftransport&quot; (paragraph 6) and foretold &quot;a marked reductionin the stopping and branch line services which are littleused by the public and which, on any dispassionatereview of the situation, should be largely handed overto road transport&quot; (paragraph 1 2h) *     Nevertheless, a railway track is a national asset, and it is essentialthat before any service is withdrawn every means ofmaking it remunerative should have been examined.51 * There are four methods of dealing with theseunremunerative services.     The first is to re-cast thesteam passenger services to give a better use of man-power, rolling stock and equipment.     The second is tointroduce diesel and electric traction and, where appropriate, light railway methods.     The third is towithdraw trains and substitute road services.     Thefourth, applicable to suburban areas, is to organise a fully co-ordinated road and rail system.     Action isbeing taken on all these methods.52. The following table indicates the measure of withdrawl of passenger services since 19h8 :-

Eastern Region.     In 1,9*4-8, 905 passengerstations were open;    175 of these have since been closed.     Diesel cars are already running, or will be running within the next two years, over practicallythe whole of the remaining branch lines and much ofthe secondary mileage of the Region.     They will reduceoperating costs substantially and bring in additionalbusiness *5k* London Midland Region.      It is  expected that afurther 20 services will be withdrawn completely or inpart, involving 1,250,000 train miles a year.     Mean-while, diesel cars are being introduced on a variety of services, e.g., in West Cumberland and between Bury andBacup.      These cars are attracting substantial additional business.55* North Eastern Region.     In 1952, about 2^million train miles a year out of a total of over 12fmillion were running at a heavy loss.     Since then the region have been actively engaged in cutting outhopelessly unprofitable train miles and in developingmultiple unit diesel services where prospects are more promising.      The Region have already withdrawn 1^ milliontrain miles a year, and another -g- million will probablybe withdrawn in the near future.56, Scottish Region.      Some further economies areexpected from the withdrawal of other services especially from the closing of stations, but diesel cars will beintroduced where the case for them is established and an experiment is being made with battery-electric rail carsin co-operation with the North of Scotland Hydro-ElectricBoard.
57. Southern Region.      Three more branch lines and eight stations are likely to be closed, but these aremarginal cases and, subject to any major change intraffics,- the possibilities of further economies inthis direction are limited.58. Western Region.     Out of 1,514 passengerstations and halts open in 1948, 191 have been closed.A comprehensive review is now in hand.     The servicesalready under examination affect 316 stations.     Afurther 583 stations are affected by services yet to be reviewed, making a total of 899 stations.     About 20branch lines are included in the review.      In additionto the possible withdrawal of services, consideration is being given to the improvement of net receipts byre-casting timetables or introducing diesel services.59. The result of all these measures will be asubstantial reduction of operating costs accompanied,it is hoped, by expansion, of traffic.     The activitiesof the Regions are not limited to the figures quoted andthe whole subject is a matter of continual review and progress.     It must be noted that the financialjustification for the Modernisation Plan made allowances for the considerable benefits arising from these measuresthis is brought to account in. the figures given inparagraph 47. above.     However, the withdrawal ofunremunerative services, which no alternative methodcan redeem, has recently been accelerated, thanks in large measure to the support given by&apos; the Minister ofTransport&apos;and Civil Aviation and it is reasonable to count upon an additional net saving of some  3m.  ayear   by the end of the next six years, at the end ofwhich the ijrocess will be more or less complete.C.    INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY60. The increases in output per head which have been recorded in this country since the war have largely beenthe result of the removal of bottlenecks and theintroduction of new equipment.     The Modernisation plan for British Railways takes account of these factors toa considerable extent and this section of the paperdeals only with increases in productivity which aredivorced from modernisation.61* It is difficult to measure the output of a railway system as a whole, still less that of some ofits components, such as the signalling system;    but- using a combination of passenger and freight carryingsas a measure, it is calculated that since 1948 theoutput per head on the railways of the United states has risen, in spite of large expenditure, by less thanone per cent, per annum.62. In Prance, with a large scale modernisationprogramme, with an economy recovering from thedevastations of war and with many staff declaredredundant, an increase of some four per cent, per annumhas been achieved since 1948.      On a similar basis of
comparison, it is estimated that British Railways have achieved an increase of. &quot;broadly two per cent, per annumover the same period.63. Railway management keeps under review theresults achieved with existing equipment and appliesthe principles of Work Study.     Further, the british railways Productivity Council is now promoting the widerand more extensive, application of the techniques of WorkStudy to all aspects of railway work.     To he effectivethis requires staff trained in Work Study methods andhaving detailed knowledge of railway working.   Accordingly,towards the end of 1956, a Work Study Training Centre forBritish Railways, London Transport, British Road Services,Docks and Waterways will he set up at Watford and it isexpected that within three years the numbers of staff sotrained will be sufficient for a large expansion of projects.6I+. Further, a specialist advisory service is being established within the Commission under a Director ofWork Study to develop a common policy and central pool of experience relating to the application of Work Studyto transport problems.      In addition to this theCommission&apos;s Director of Work Study is responsible for advising on-the co-ordination of relations with theTrade Unions on Work Study and for the general super-vision of the Training Centre.      In this task he willbe assisted by an Advisory Committee which will include representatives of the Trade Unions and of outsideindustry.65. A successful Work Study scheme in the ReadingSignal Works has led to a substantial increase in total output with a reduced labour force, a lower wages bill and increased individual earnings.      Investigations inother Signal Works are being undertaken.     Altogether,spread over several departments, 30 Work Study scheme shave been implemented throughout British Railways and atthe present time about L\.0 schemes are under investigation.These include a very large scheme at Swindon Workshops,Offices and Stores.      Consultants are also at themoment investigating tv/o Motive Power Depots with theobject of recommending the introduction of incentivebonus schemes for maintenance work.     Further details ofWork Study schemes are given in Appendix C.66. Over the past eight years Incentive Bonus scheme shave been introduced at certain Civil Engineering Depart-ment Workshops and Production Depots with considerable success.     Increases in output of over 100 per cent, havebeen obtained in some cases.     A pilot scheme ofincentive bonus payments for track maintenance was introduced in the Woking area following a work studyinvestigation of the various aspects of the lengthman&apos;sjob.     With the co-operation of the staff the scheme hasbeen extended to the Basingstoke and other areas in theSouthern Region,     All Regions are now giving consider-ation to the introduction of similar pilot schemes.Their introduction has been approved on the Western,
Scottish, and North Eastern Regions, and it is hoped tointroduce a scheme on the London Midland Region beforethe end of the year.     The results of the extendedscheme have been impressive and the application of thisscheme on permanent way maintenance alone to the wholeof British Railways, which will take several years tocomplete, may well achieve a larger potential savingthan was originally forecast by the Consultants whocarried out the preliminary investigations for the pilot scheme.The broad aim of work study is to obtain themaximum productivity from men, machines and material.It provides a means of determining the best way of doing a job and affords a basis for financial incentiveschemes.     It also provides a factual basis for introducing changes in traditional working methods andin the elimination of obsolete practices.     Moreover,Work Study enables sound labour control schemes to be devised, from which rational financial incentive bonuspayments can be made on a basis which gives the Staffconcerned a fair share.of the resulting economies.The financial benefit to the Commission will be limitedaccordingly.The introduction of new equipment will increase productivity.     Mechanised equipment in offices is widelyused for payroll, goods and stores accounting.    british railways are as far if not further ahead than etherindustries in the country in the development ofelectronic devices in this field.     Electronic equip-ment has been installed in offices at Crewe, Derby,Peterborough and Doncaster and is planned for Paddingtonand Swindon in the near&apos;future and later for Barry andBristol.     A mechanised bureau is being formed in glasgow and additional mechanisation at Newcastle,Darlington and York is under consideration.A special advisory panel has been establishedby the British Transport Commission to encourage and develop electronic computer techniques throughout the commissions undertakings and to advise on theirinstallation.      It is further charged with investigation into the application of electronic control techniques tothe operating departments in such form as wagon controland automatic operation in marshalling yards.The calculation of the improvement in the netrevenues of British Railways as the result of theapplication of work study schemes, modern office methods and other measures designed to improve productivity,should be made on conservative lines.     The primary object is to improve efficiency.     For example, thereis at present a serious shortage of staff to maintainthe permanent way:    the big gain to be derived from theschemes mentioned in paragraph 66 above is not that theywill save men, but  that the permanent way will be bettermaintained.     Then again, in the Modernisation Plancredit has already been taken for economies resultingfrom improved equipment and from improved methods of operation and this credit cannot be taken twice.    Many
of the activities on British Railways are not susceptibleof improved of improved efficiency save by a radical change in organisation;    for example, a public roadlevel crossing cannot be looked after by less than oneattendant until the law concerning such crossings ischanged (paragraph 78) .     It is also necessary to bearwell in mind the point made in paragraph 67 above.For these and other reasons of similar nature, theCommission, while expecting very important results fromthe measures now in hand to improve productivity, cannot reasonably assess the additional improvement in ne trevenue, beyond that taken to account in the ModernisationPlan, at more than  5m. a year by 1961.    The introductionof measures to improve productivity must inevitably leadto some displacement of manpower, but it is the Commission^intention to deal with redundancy problems arising there-from, by re-absorption and by non-replacement of wastagein so far as this is possible.D.    STATUTORY OBLIGATIONS and freedom TO COMPETE71. First among all the statutory restrictions and obligations which have fettered the operations of rail-ways on a strictly &quot;economic&quot; basis must rank therestrictions on freedom in the matter of fixing fares and charges and the obligation to afford equality oftreatment to all persons.72. The 1953 Act has removed the previous obliga-tion to afford equality of treatment to all persons andempowered the Commission to submit to the Tribunal a newMerchandise Charges Scheme giving them a much largermeasure of commercial freedom than heretofore.     Thedraft Scheme as submitted laid down maximum carriagecharges more related to costs, in place of StandardCharges related to a classification of merchandiseprimarily based on value, and the Commission were tohave discretion as to what they charged within thesemaxima.      They would no longer be required to obtainthe Tribunal&apos;s approval to alterations in actual chargesbelow the maxima or to publish any actual charges otherthan the maxima.73. The Charges Scheme has after lengthy public enquiry been amended by the Tribunal&apos;s Interim decision as follows: while agreeing the principle in general of maximum charges for conveyance of traffic, the Tribunaldecided that there should be two exceptions -(a) any consignment weighing 100 tons or more;(b) goods carried in owners&apos; wagons.In both these instances the Tribunal decided that thecharges made must be &quot;reasonable charges&quot;, which would on application be settled by them.     The Tribunal notonly rejected the Commission&apos;s proposal for a singleseries of scales, but lowered the proposed maximumcharges and provided a separate series for a list ofnamed commodities normally carried in bulk;    and they also introduced in each series alternative and lowermaximum charges for goods consigned to and/or from aprivate siding.
71+. It follows, therefore, that the extent of thecommercial freedom for which the Commission had asked&apos;. has &quot;been appreciably restricted by the Tribunal&apos;s InterimDecision,      Nevertheless British Railways will takeadvantage of the freedom permitted under the scheme to reorganise their freight charging arrangements towardsthe following ends(a) the encouragement of traffic consigned in larger quantities and good wagon loads;(b) the encouragement of regular traffic forwhich economical services can be arranged;(c) the attraction of good loading traffic, nowpassing by road, for long and mediumdistances;(d) the avoidance of loss on some of the shorterdistance rail traffic.The consequent changes in the pattern of traffics and railway operations are reflected in the financialestimates, quoted above, of the eventual out-turn ofthe Modernisation Plan and the right to exercise a much wider measure of commercial freedom is, therefore, an indispensable element in the realisation of these estimates.75. But the changes in charging arrangements willhave to start at a time when road competition is keenerand greater than ever before and when the service afforded by the railways is below the efficiency and reliabilityneeded.     Also, it will take some time to effect the .complete re-orientation of selling policy and sellingmethods which is required.     Though the benefits will emerge slowly, in the end they will be substantial.How substantial, will depend in large degree on the price policy to be pursued by the Commission in the near future.This is discussed in Chapter V.76, In addition to the benefits to be derived fromthe greater freedom of charging, which be it rememberodhas yet to come into operation, there is also thepossibility of obtaining, with the support of theGovernment, relief from other outdated statutory obligations.  &apos;77. As an example the case of road bridges over therailways may be cited.     Where lines were constructed soas to cross existing public roads, and the road was carried over the line by means of a bridge, the railway companiescame under a statutory obligation to maintain not onlythe structure of the bridge, but also the surface of theroad over the bridge and the raised approaches.     Theposition in this respect has radically altered with thegrowth of motor traffic on the roads and the cost ofmaintaining these surfaces has become a heavy liability.While these responsibilities are being or have beentransferred to other Authorities, the Commission remain responsible for financial contributions.
mm78. Another example is the cost of level crossings.Where lines were carried across public roads on thelevel, the railway companies came under a stautory obligation to provide gates which, when opened to road traffic, completely fenced in the railway, and also toprovide an attendant to superintend the crossing and to open and shut the gates.     In many instances, particularly at level crossings adjoining stations, the gates are controlled by a signalman from a box at the crossing,but  there are also very many public crossings up end down the country at which it is necessary to provide specialstaff.     The cost of manning these crossings at present day wage rates is considerable;    in a number of cases ithas increased from about  50 to around  1+00 a year,and the total figure has risen from  220,000 in 1938 toabout  1m. now.     Often, moreover, the staff at thesecrossings, though in continuous attendance, are by nomeans busily employed.79. The Commission already have powers to substitutelifting barriers for gates at public level crossings,subject to the Minister&apos;s consent in each individual case.These barriers, however-, would lead to no major economiesso long as the Commission are required by law to maintainstaff at all public road crossings.     Economies could beeffected if the staff at many crossings could be removed by operating lifting barriers either automatically bytrack circuits or remotely from the nearest signal box.An adaptation of these methods might also enable somesignal boxes at level crossings to be closed in slacktraffic hours with resultant economies.     There is,however, no experience of these methods in this countryalthough they are widely used abroad.     It is not evenpossible to try them out while the law remains as it is.80. The Commission, therefore, consider that  thetime has now arrived to review the statutory provisions which require attendants at all public level crossings.Any changes must have due regard for safety and theCommission are already in touch with the Chief Inspect-ing Officer of Railways on the relevant problems.While the Commission are on the look out forways of obtaining relief from obligations which have become out  of date with the passage of time, and wouldlike to see this process speeded up, the rights of other authorities and individuals are, as a general rule, so closely linked with railway obligations that there israrely a short cut to freedom, and progress must inevita-bly be rather slow.It is difficult to assess the financial benefits to be derived from the policy of freedom in charging andfrom relief from statutory obligations.

Making^themost reasonable assumptions possible and taking intoaccount in particular the benefits to be derived from aless restricted, more selective and more aggressiveselling policy and from such alterations in fares and
charges (net) as may &quot;be feasible within the ambit ofCharging Policy as described in the next chapter, atotal improvement of  20m. a year by 1961 or 1962 can reasonably be expected.     It would represent, indeed,a rate of improvement of less than 1 per cent, a year,over the next six years, on the present takings ofBritish Railways.      An increase in this figure of atleast a further  5m. by the end of the following eight years would seem a safe assumption.
The Commission have already announced that theywill not make general increases in their fares and chargesduring 1956, provided that as a result of the re-assessment of their financial position now being made, a course ofaction consistent with their statutory obligations.and theproper development of their undertaking can be worked out and adopted.      Pares and charges were in any case &quot;frozen&quot;until the end of September by the decisions of theGovernment and the Commission taken in March of this year.As to the remaining months of the year, the Commissionfelt that on commercial grounds alone the time was un-propitious for general increases in passenger fares orother charges.      In respect of the policy to be pursuedafter this period of &quot;freeze&quot;, however? the commission are presented with several alternatives.Firsts having regard to their duties under the19^4-7 Act 5 the Commission might attempt to meet the presentunbalance, and recoup their past deficitst by increasing their charges in the near future to the full amountnecessary.      Theoretically, an increase producing anaverage of 15 per cent on heavy railway traffics like coal and minerals j and 2-g- per cent on other railway goods?would mean almost  30m.  a year;    an increase of 10 percent on railway parcels and mails by passenger trainwould mean almost  5m.  a year;    and a general increase in railway fares of 10 per cent would mean  1 2m. a year.The total of  U7m.  from railways would suffice, in con-junction with minor increases elsewhere, not only to stop the existing gap in the Commission&apos;s budget but also toleave a small margin over.But British Railways are faced v/ith sharpcompetition over a considerable part of their passenger and freight traffics.      Moreover, public opinion wouldbe particularly resentful of any heavy increases at this time.      In the long run the immediate gain of revenue would probably be purchased at the expense of a substantialcontraction in the traffics offered to the Commission.In other words, any attempt to impose large increases intheir fares or charges in the near future would, so faras can be estimated at present, damage the Commission^business temporarily for certain, and possibly permanently.As the second alternative of policy ? theCommission might attempt to make a partial reduction intheir current deficit by imposing all the increases in fares and charges which any particular traffics would bear.      However, the general objections given in theprevious paragraph apply in lesser degree to a partialoperation of this kind.      Also, the Commission hope thatthe new scheme of charging control, to which reference is made in Chapter IV, will be in operation by the middleof 1957.      The greater charging freedom thereby afforded?if introduced against a background of widespread dissatis-faction at the level of fares and charges? would be given a bad start, and much of its benefits might thus beforfeited.
88. To sum up, it is too soon yet to say in detailwhat should be done after the end of the year, and ingeneral, apart from adjustments of the kind mentioned inparagraph 87 above, the wiser policy to pursue in thenear future is one of price restraint - not necessarily&quot;price freezing&quot; - in the knowledge that the results ofthis policy and of the consequent goodwill will substantiallyimprove the position of the railways within the next fewyears and protect permanently the whole scope of their business.      Any net revenue so sacrificed, temporarily,may be regarded as an investment which will not onlyprevent an undermining of railway traffics in a critical period - and a consequent decrease in the benefits of the modernisation Plan - but will also help to provide in thenot-too-distant future the positive financial improvementof many millions of pounds a year already mentioned inthe previous chapter.87. Looking beyond.the immediate situation, it isa basic assumption of this paper that the commission should have reasonable charging freedom.      If theircosts should rise they must be free to adjust their charges.      There are, in any case, certain instances where local or selective increases are justified andshould be made.
CHAPTER VI    :    CORRECTIVE ACTION IN PROGRESS -OTHER ACTIVITIES89. It has already &quot;been remarked that , of the .other activities belonging to the Commission, the least,satisfactory from a financial point of view are london transport and the Inland Waterways.90. As regards London Transport, their operations have in each year since 1950 failed to make a propercontribution to the interest and other central charges of the Commission.      In the result, about  15m.  of the commissions accumulated deficit of  70m.  at the end of1955 is attributable to London Transport.      Though it isgenerally accepted that London should pay its way, thedelay between increases in wage rates and price levels and the subsequent increases in fares has produced this long series of yearly shortfalls&apos;, and unlike british railways, London Transport offers no real prospect offinancial improvement except by increasing fares.91* London Transport is already a modern and efficient transport system, and the volume of service it offers cannot be reduced significantly.      Nor,unfortunately, is there much prospect of increases intraffic.      With more private motoring attracting customersaway from the public services and with increasingcongestion in the streets, which both increases the costand reduces the attractiveness of the London Transportroad services, the future trend of traffic is more likelyto continue the decline of recent years.92. The Commission have recently made certainlocal adjustments to fares in London.      While they will always endeavour to keep fares in the London area as lowas possible, current costs must in future be met by thecurrent level of fares.      There are no future expectationsto justify a different policy.93. As to Inland Waterways, the efforts of theCommission to remedy the position are well-known.      Theopposition to these efforts is equally well-known.      Theposition is now being investigated by another Committeeof Inquiry, the Bowes Committee, and until this committee report and the Government announce their policy on thefuture of the waterways, it is not possible to say whatfuture easing of the financial position can be counted on.In relation to the sum-total of the Commission^ problem in its present magnitude, the relief will in any case bemarginals however important in itself.94* Efforts will continue to be made to improve the financial results of other activities of the Commissionincluding docks, road passenger and freight services andhotels and catering, by greater efficiency and, whenappropriate, increases in charges.
The foregoing sections have summarised someof the major factors in the financial and commercialposition of the Commission.      This is not the only aspectwhich matters.      Questions of defence and of generalstrategy are involvedj and questions of social policy andthe public benefit.      The economics of a public service are not reflected exclusively in its own particular accountof profit and loss.      Nevertheless -it is relevant to enquire how the financial problem of the Commission wouldappear if the results of the remedial measures outlined above were tested by the ordinary criteria of commercialfinance.Provided that these measures are given a properchance to fructify, and on the assumptions set out at thebeginning of this paper, the prospect is that the annualnet revenue account of the Commission will be in balanceby 1961 or 1962.      This is after charging all remunerationon capital borrowings in full, old and. new, save onlyinterest on deficits.      By 1970 there should be not onlya balance, but a surplus of  50m.  a year over and abovethe cost of servicing the capital.These prospects for the future must be compared,with the immediate outlook.      It is clear from what hasbeen said in this paper that for the next few years, theperiod of reconstruction and development, the revenues ofthe Commission are not likely to cover the interest charges in full.      For this there are two main reasons(a) In the early stages the rising yield frommodernisation will lag some years behind theincreased interest charges on the capitalworks set in train.      The sowing must be inadvance of the reaping.(b) It will be two or three years before theresults of the other measures now in progress can produce a really substantial effect on thepresent running rate of deficit.A commercial concern faced with a similarsituation, being financed by equity capital, would probablyask its shareholders to forgo remuneration of their capitalduring the period of reconstruction.      If the shareholderswere satisfied that the undertaking was fundamentally sound and that the future revenue prospects were sufficientlygood, they would be likely to agree.The Commission, however, are financed entirely by fixed interest  capital which must continue to be serviced.They are not permitted to borrow money to cover theirdeficits.      Even if they were, it would only mean a further increase in the annual deficit and a still-mounting accum-ulated deficit to be carried forward in the balance sheet.By such a piling on of burdens beyond the ability of theCommission to meet them during this period, financialdiscipline would be undermined;    the affairs of theCHAPTER VII    :    THE FINANCIAL POSITION DURINGTHE PERIOD OP RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
100. There is ample cover both of revenue and ofcapital for dealing with this situation in the way inwhich, it has been suggested, a commercial concern would deal with it.      The balance sheet at 31st December, 1953?was one of great inherent strength, despite the deficitsaccumulated.      The capital assets, excluding goodwill, hada written down book value of over  1,500m. ;    their real value today is dependent on their earning power, no doubt,and this again must depend mainly on the fares and charges which are permitted and on the burdens of public obligationwhich are carried;    but the replacement cost of the total investment, in terms of current money values, can be put at well over  4,000m.      It is not proposed to write re-valued asset figures into the books, as has occasionallybeen done elsewhere? but if the assets were so written up,the net assets would be three times as large as thecapital&apos;liabilities (1. e.  the British Transport Stock in issue) of  -1,444m.101. The prospective revenue results are illustrated by the graphs in Appendix D.      The effect of the time-lagin the fructifying of new capital expenditure is seen oncurve A, which shows that during the next few years therewill be, naturally and inevitably, a slight burden (net)rather than a benefit, but that thereafter there will bea net annual benefit rising to at least  45m.  a year afterpaying all interest on the capital expenditure involved.On curve B is seen the effect of the remaining measures nowin progress.      After an initial worsening of the position,the existing deficit is rapidly overhauled, and is turnedinto a net benefit of  5m.      Taking the two curves together,by the close of the 1960&apos;s there is a total surplus revenue of  50m.  a year (after charging to revenue all interestexcept on deficits) but the critical period of reconstruction and development terminates much earlier and the commission would probably &quot;cross the line&quot; from annual deficit to annual surplus in 1961  or 1962.      The position at thethree major points of time shown in the curves may be illustrated in the folTowing fignree :-Commission would be made to appear In an unreasonablyhopeless light, which &quot;by its effect on public opinion would hamper them commercially and by its effect on theirown staff would weaken morale.      The physical recovery ofBritish Railways ought, on the contrary, to be matched bya stimulus- to morale, an improvement in public esteem,and a firm financial discipline directed towards clearfinancial objectives.

There is., therefore, ample scope for a rocon-struction of the Commission&apos;s finances.      Alternatively,there is ample cover for an operation by which the revenue account of the Commission, during the next few years of
development and reconstructions should be relievedtemporarily of the obligation to meet the exceptionalcharges (partly of a quasi-capital nature, partlylegacies from the past) falling upon it during this time.      These amounts are represented by the shadedareas shown in Appendix D.      In total some  200m. wouldbe accumulated in suspense by 1961 or 1962, to which mustbe added the deficit of about  120m.  to be carried forward at the end of 1956.      These are large sums but they arenot large compared with the later surpluses which shouldbe more than sufficient to amortize any. amounts so held insuspense over a reasonable period.      Nor are they large inrelation to. the undertaking as a whole.103, In this situation the Commission urgentlyrecommend that some financial plan should be adopted which,while it avoids subsidy, will place their organisation ona firm, sound basis during these critical years of recon-struction.      They expressly request that any relieftemporarily accorded to them in relation to their immediateobligations should be strictly limited in time and amount.10h, The justification for this recommendation is represented by the forecasts given in this i&apos;)aper.      In along-range assessment of this nature there are necessarilymany imponderables.      The forecasts are subject to the basic assumptions stated at the outset;    they could beupset by factors beyond the Commissions control.      Never-theless. the Commission are confident that in general terms their assessment of the future outlook is reliableand that it represents a proper basis for the formulation of policy at this time.13 SEP 1956
appendix the PROGRAMME FOR RAILWAY MODERNISATION1. The following sections deal with theprogramme of modernisation works and with the associatedschedule of production of equipment.For convenience, the programme is dividedunder the main headings of engineering activity(a) Electrification.(h) The Locomotive Building Programme.(c) The Carriage and Wagon Building Programme.(d) Civil Engineering.(e) Signal Engineering.In fact all these activities are interdependent,and in most phases of modernisation work, overlap.    Forexample, in an electrification scheme, all come into play and the rate of completion may he governed by the pace at which civil and signal engineering work can becarried out, rather than by the rate of supply andcommittal to service of electrical equipment and rolling stock.Naturally, the plans that have been made lackdefinition when referred to the later stages, ten years or more ahead.Concentration has been given to planning thework that must be carried out during the next six years.But the ultimate objectives of the Modernisation Planhave been borne in mind throughout.2.  ElectrificationOn 6th March, 1956, the Commission publishedtheir decision to adopt the 25kV A.C.  system for futureelectrification, throughout British Railways save on those sections of the Southern Region where the existing660v. D.C.  system would be extended.     Energetic steps were at once taken, in conjunction with the manufacturing industry, to put in hand the design, development and supply of the new equipment required, and notificationwas given to the Central Electricity Authority concerningthe first requirements for the supply of power.A preliminary programme for the completion ofall the electrification schemes contained in the Planhas been worked out.      This takes into consideration thetime that is required to develop and test in service thecompletely new forms of equipment and rolling stockrequired for electrification by the 25kV A.C,  system, therate at which the equipment and rolling stock can be manufactured, installed and put into service, and therate at which the very large volume of associated civil and Signal Engineering work can be carried out.
The provisional programme of completion datesis as follows : -London Midland Region (25kV A.C.  System).Slade Lane Junction (Manchester)to Wilmslow (Test Section).Manchester to Orewe.Remainder of Main Line electrical -fication, Euston to manchester and Liverpool.Eastern Region (25kV A.G. System, except where otherwise shown).Shenfield - Southend (1500v.D.C.  System)Colchester - Clacton (25kV.A.C.  System) (Test Section).Conversion of Liverpool Street,Chelmsford, Southend Sectionsfrom D. C.  to A, C.  System.Enfield-Chingford, Hertford andBishop&apos;s Stortford.London-Tilbury and SouthendChelmsford to Ipswich and coastal Branches.King&apos;s Cross? Moorgate, Hitchinand Letchworth.Eastern and North Eastern RegionsKing&apos;s Cross - York and LeedsScottish Region ( 25kV A. C. System).Glasgow Suburban,Stage I.    North of Clyde.Stage II.  South of Clyde.Southern Region (660v. D.C  System)Extension of electrified lines to Ramsgate, Dover, Folkestoneand Hastings (via Ashford).Mid 1958.Mid 1959.(Tentative) 1967.January, 1957.Mid 1958.Mid 1959.Mid 1960.Mid 1961.By Stages upto 1965.(Tentative)1962.(Tentative) 1970.1960.1962.1962.The programme has been laid down to provide forwork to proceed at the most rapid rate which the combinedcapacity of the Railways and of private Industry isestimated to allow.The rate of electrification at present plannedbuilds up to a peak in 1962 and thereafter decreases.At the peak of production it will be necessary to commission electrified single track at the rate of 1 ,000miles per annum, and to place in service at least 200electric locomotives and 900 electric multiple unit traincoaches per annum.After 1962, it is estimated that capacity willbe available for undertaking electrification works inaddition to those provided for in the Plan.      The Commission
have under consideration proposals by which advantage-could be taken of this, so as to exploit to the full the great operational and economic benefits the Railwayswill derive from a wider extension of electric traction.3*  The Locomotive Building Programme(a) Steam Locomotives  :The Commission have already announced that no newexpress passenger or suburban steam locomotiveswill be built after the 1956 building programme.A further 8k heavy freight and 61 mixed trafficsteam locomotives will be built during 1957 and early in 1958? completing existing programmes.Pew, if any, steam locomotives will be builtthereaf t er.(b ) Electric Locomotives  :Electric locomotives, now in the development stage,will be supplied by manufacturers during 1958 in small numbers in prototype form.      Thereafter,after final designs have been settled, production will rapidly be stepped up to reach the peak ofover 200 per annum during 1961.(c) Diesel Shunting Locomotives :There are at present in use on British Railways510 diesel shunting locomotives.      This total willbe increased to about 900 locomotives on completionof authorised programmes in 1958.The Plan envisages a further 1,200 shunting loco-motives being required to replace the 1,500 steamshunting locomotives which will still then remain.Programmes now in preparation provide for the supplyof about 700 diesel locomotives, during the period1958 - 1962, and if possible the rate of supply willbe accelerated.By 1962 the plans provide for about 1,600 dieselshunters in service.Thereafter the remainder of the diesel locomotivesrequired to dispense with steam shunting altogetherwill be obtained as rapidly as circumstances will allow.Considerable savings v/ill flow from this trans-formation.     Apart from instant availability offered by the diesel shunter, and the small loss of operatingtime required for servicing, it can be operated byone man.
(d.) Main Line Diesel Locomotives  :Orders have been placed for 174 main line diesellocomotives at a cost of  11.4 million..     Deliverywill commence towards the end of 1957.These have been allocated to Regions as followsLondon Midland   -   65Eastern -   80Western -   14Southern -   -15Although the first cost of diesel locomotives isthree to four times that of steam locomotives of comparable power, depreciation is a small item inthe total cost of providing locomotive haulage.Diesel locomotives can cover large mileages withoutthe frequent and lengthy absences from service re-quired by steam locomotives for fuelling service andmaintenances, and much lower operating costs are possible when full advantage is taken of theircapacities.The first fleet of main line diesel locomotives isto be put into intensive operation, under carefulobservation, and is intended to be the subject of a thorough and selective trial.Essential data will be obtained in the shortest possible time to enable the Commission to place orders for large numbers of locomotives in standardtypes, specifying designs which can be depended upon to give the service they require.Until these trials have been.completed, the Commissionintend to restrict further orders to comparatively small numbers.By 1961, however, it is expected that annual orderswill reach a level of about 200 locomotives and thatthis rate of production will be required to continueeach year for an indefinite period.The Carriage and Wagon Building Programme.(a) Passenger Rolling Stock :During the period of seven years ending in December1962, it is expected that a total of about 20,000coaching vehicles of all kinds v/ill be constructed,replacing about 25,000 existing vehicles, including all the remaining wooden-bodied coaches, some 14,000in number.The programme is based upon a substantial increase inthe rate of replacement of vehicles of obsolete type,which at the present rate would have to be retained in service for a further four or five years.
The programme covers units of all types, and apartfrom locomotive hauled stock? includes electricmultiple unit stock, and diesel multiple unitstock of varied designs.(i) Multiple Unit Electric StockDuring the period ending in 1962 a total ofi+,500 electric multiple unit vehicles willhe required to cover the needs of electrifi-cation of the Manchester-Crewe line? withextensions towards Euston? and of the otherelectrification schemes in South-east Essex?East Kent? Glasgow? the King&apos;s Gross suburbanlines? and extensions of the existingelectrification to Ipswich and coastal branches.The majority of the stock will be of the opensuburban type.      Special attention is being given to the development of a high standard ofriding quality? and the special requirementsof the suburban or short distance passengerare being studied in relation to internaldesign.During most of the period? a rate of productionof 900 vehicles a year will be required.The first supplies of prototype units for service on lines electrified by the 25kV A.C.system are expected to be available for trialsin the later months of 1957.(ii) Multiple Unit Diesel VehiclesThe Modernisation Plan envisaged 4,600 vehiclesof this type being placed in service.Contracts have already been placed in railwayshops and with manufacturers? for 2,1+01? whichare expected to be completed in 1958.The following table gives details of theservices to which these vehicles have been allocated.    Two hundred and seventy-twovehicles are already in service.It is anticipated that the remainder of the4*600 vehicles covered by the Plan will bein service before the end of 19,61.

The trains described, above? with the exceptionof those required for the London-Hastings service?are built to a number of basic designs? and arefitted with under-floor engines and mechanical orhydraulic transmissions.The internal design of the cars is adjusted to suit local requirements.Development work is now proceeding on two furthertypes of diesel trains of radically differingcharacteristics? one for use in high speed? luxury?main line services? and the other for operation inlightly used branch lines where economy of runningcost is the prime consideration.The high speed luxury train will run between large cities and will contain all that is best to offer for the comfort and amenity of the passenger.      Itis expected that a few of these trains will be inoperation towards the end of 1958? and their further introduction will depend upon the way inwhich they are received by the travelling public.A light rail car? powered with a single under-floordiesel engine? and designed to achieve maximumeconomy in running and maintenance costs may proveof great value? since some rail services in rural areas? at present running at a loss greater than can be counter-balanced by the use of present types of diesel trains? may thereby be preserved.The Commission intend to carry out extensivepractical trials with such vehicles in a number of rural services throughout the country? givingparticular attention to the changing needs of thecountry passenger? and to economic operation inall its aspects.      It is hoped to commence thetrials in 1957.(iii) Locomotive Hauled StockWhatever may be the trend in favour of multipleunit express trains? the need will continue tohaul long distance traffic by locomotives? eitherelectric or diesel? and for many years? steam.During the period 1956/1962? about 7,700 gang-way ed locomotive hauled coaches for main lineoperation will be built.New standard coaches are being developed whichwill provide very much improved passengeraccommodation? in which special attention hasbeen paid toSmooth riding.Comfortable seating.Attractive decor.Heating, Ventilation and Lighting.Reduction of noise.Improved toilet facilities.Cleanliness.It is expected that vehicles of improved designwill begin to appear during 1957.
New and improved types of Restaurant and BuffetCars are being developed, and it is intended thata five-year programme of replacement of thepresent stock will commence towards the end. of1957. involving the construction of a fleet of600 vehicles.During the 1956/62 period a programme of construction will be undertaken covering afurther 2,800 vehicles of various types, classedas coaching vehicles, such as luggage&apos;vans, fishvans, mail vans and the like.(b) Freight Rolling Stock(i) Mineral VfagonsThe plan provides for the replacement of allremaining low capacity timber-bodied coal wagonsby all-steel wagons of higher capacity.    existing contracts for manufacture of the 16-ton steelwagon will, by the end of 1957 have providedBritish Railways with a total fleet of 320,000 ofthis type.      About 190,000 low capacity timber-bodied wagons will remain.      These will be re-placed by 2l4-i-ton steel wagons to the extent thattraders1 terminal facilities will permit, but ithas become apparent that their use will be limitedduring the period of the Modernisation Plan.      Itis therefore necessary to construct a wagon ofslightly lower capacity;    21/22-tons? to give aswide a use as possible.Such a wagon is now being designed.Plans are being made to build numbers of highcapacity wagons, largely of the new 21/22-ton typein a long term programme commencing in 1958, witha target of the complete replacement of the 190,000old wagons by 1966 by a reduced number of highcapacity wagons.Similarly, wagons for the transport of iron orewill be of higher capacity, and where it is economicand desirable to do so in the interests of thetrader and British Railways, special wagons with high axle loading and with limited route availabilitywill be built to be operated in circuit working.(ii) General Merchandise WagonsUnder this heading, wagons will be built in annualprogrammes to meet the changing needs of industry?and in addition to vehicles of the standard types?wagons are being, and will continue to be designedof a specialised character for the carriage of specific types of traffic, e. g. cement in bulk?steel strip coil, palletised consignments? containers.The plans provide for a total of 255?O00 wagons of all types to be built during the period 1956/70.
9 &quot;2sit.....-9-ContainersThe design of containers is &quot;being reviewed? andit is expected that there will be considerabledevelopment in this type of traffic.It is probable that an average of 5*000 containers&quot;      a year will be constructed during the period. 1956/62.(iii) Continuous Brakes on Freight TrainsThe Commission have decided to adopt the vacuumbrake as standard for freight rolling stock? andto fit brakes to all stock as quickly as possible.The rate of fitting is dependent upon a numberof factors, notably :-(a) The rate at which the necessary equipmentcan be provided by industry and.by railway,shops;ijyi;:.:     (b) The rate at which the equipment can befitted into wagons, and other necessarymodifications made; and(c) The rate at which the wagons can be released from traffic and moved to theworkshops where fitting is to take place.The operation of freight trains at speeds up to 60miles per hour, entails modifications to various types of wagon apart from fitting of brakes.      Forexample, it is necessary to close couple all freightstock running at these high speeds, and this will entail the provision of screw type couplings andnew buffers.Mineral wagon operation at express speeds requires..,the larger mineral wagons to be fitted with rollerbearings.      This will.involve the fitting of some600,000 roller bearing axleboxes to existingwagons.Arrangements must also be made to provide for the -maintenance of the mechanical brake equipment andfor testing in marshalling yards and goods depotsas well as in v/orks and outstations.Taking all these considerations into account, andhaving regard to the numbers and varying types of, vehicle involved, the programme for fittingcontinuous brakes to all freight stock has been designed initially to cover a period of ten years,but it is hoped that this period might be reduced,and every effort to this end will be made.
The preliminary programme of fitting is asfollows:-Year	Fitting to Existing Wagons	By new Building	Total Number of Wagons to &quot;be fitted1957 1958 1959 1960 1961	25,000 47,500 47,500 47,500 . 47 * 5.00.	17,000 28,000 24,000    . 19,000 19,500	42,000 75,500 71 ,500 66,500 67,0001962 1963 196U 1965 1 966	47,500 47,500 47,500 47,500 47,500	19,000 18,000 15,000 10,000 10,000	66 ,500 65,000 62,500 57,500 57,500(iv) development the Commission have recently authorised theestablishment, at Faverdale Works, Darlington,of a development unit fully equipped to dealwith all aspects of Carriage and Wagon development.This unit will initiate and carry out development on a wide range of carriage and wagon subjects,in some cases in collaboration with industry.    Itwill cover, such matters as  :-(a) Design and prototype production of newdesigns of rolling stock and carriagebogies;(b) Design and experimental production of improved axleboxes, drawgear, buffers andbrake details;(c) Developments of new methods of heatingand ventilating of coaching stock;(d) Entirely new conceptions which might beinspired by the availability of newmaterials or new processes.It is expected that this unit would be able to start its work within twelve months, and will be built up to be fully operative in two years.Civil Engineering work  the- following paragraphs outline the main features of the work :-(a)   Works Associated with ElectrificationThe principal works required for electrificationare preparation of the track for higher speeds,structural and track alterations at stations andjunctions, bridge and tunnel alterations to pro-vide for electrical clearances, and the constructionof depots for the new motive power and rolling stock.
Work is.already in hand on the strengthening ofthe road bed and extensive re-ballasting and additional relaying of track as necessary on thelines included in the first stages of electrification.Surveys are in hand to. determine the details ofthe structural alterations required to giveelectrical clearancesj and site work, alreadycommenced to cover the early stages, will be a continuing xorocess throughout the spread ofelectrification.(b) Other Track works in addition to the track improvement work required on lines to be electrified, similar work must becarried out on other main lines to meet the higherspeeds that will be attained by express dieselhauled trains and high speed multiple unit dieseltrains.Goods lines must also be improved to allow forthe faster speeds of freight operation made possible by the continuous brake.Orders have been placed for additional heavymechanised equipment to assist in this work.      By1958 there will be available, for service 100ballast tamping machines and 16 ballast cleaningmachines.Orders have also been placed for four electricrail welders which will be delivered in 1957 and1958.      When these have been received and installedin depots, an extensive programme of installation of long welded rails will be undertaken.With the elimination of the rail joint, trackmaintenance costs will be reduced, and smootherriding of trains&apos; will result.(c) Building, Structural and Other HeavyConstruction Work____A wide range of work is to be undertaken, apartfrom that associated with Electrification,The planning of building work is involved in character, and must be built up in detail, item byitem.      Hence it is not possible at this stage togive a comprehensive picture of the whole of thework covered by the Plan.Building work will include station reconstruction and improvements, the construction of new depotsfor diesel locomotives and multiple unit trainsand other rolling stock, and the provision of newfreight terminals.      Much of this work is already in hand.Important station reconstructions have been authorised at Peterborough, Plymouth, Banbury andCannon Street and many other schemes are in the design stage.
New maintenance depots for diesel multiple unittrains are authorised at Lincoln, Norwich,Stratford, Glasgow, Ayr, Edinburgh, Darlington,St. Leonards, Tyseley and Cardiff (Canton).A model layout of a diesel train depot has been evolved, and details have been issued for the guidance of designers.Considerable changes are foreseen in the design and layout of freight terminals to facilitateinterchange of goods and containers from road torail, and the development of model designs isunder close study.Over  14 million has already been authorised forthe construction of new marshalling yards, which,for the Civil Engineers, involve heavy earthworkand extensive track laying.The most important works so far authorised arethose at Ripple Lane (Barking), Millerhill(Edinburgh), Thornton (Fife), Perth, Temple mills and Port Talbot.A heavy programme of bridge reconstruction is contemplated, to overcome arrears which still re-main as the result of the war, and the steelshortages which followed.The plans are designed as far as possible, tocarry out bridge renewals on lines to be electrifiedin advance of the opening of the new services, soas to avoid placing speed restrictions on them ata later date, necessary&apos;during the period of reconstruction.It is expected that the level of expenditureon these works will build up to a level of about  25million a year by 1959 and will subsequently bemaintained at this level until the later stages of thePlan have been reached.In achieving this output, considerable assistance will be required from Consultants andContractors, and they are already being employed to an ever increasing extent.6.  Signal Engineering Y\forkThe work of the Signal Engineer may beconsidered under the following five heads :-(a) Work associated with Electrification.(b) Installation of Automatic Train Control.(c) Signalling of new Marshalling Yards.(d) Other Signal Modernisation Works.(e) Telecommunications.
Q6(c) Signalling of New Marshalling: YardsApart from the signalling and communications systemrequired in the yards, the programme allows for the installation of automatic braking equipment tocontrol the speed of wagons during gravity shunting.Considerable developments are anticipated in this field, in the provision of automatic controldevices for the brakes, so eliminating human error,and enabling shunting to continue in fog and otheradverse conditions.The following paragraphs outline the main features of the work :-(a) Work Associated with ElectrificationThe electrification of a line of railvray has avery considerable effect on the requirements, forsignalling.      There is not only the necessity totake measures to avoid electrical interferenceand physical obstruction to the sighting ofsemaphore signals? but in addition there are the changes necessary to cater for the increaseddensity and speed of traffic which electrificationmakes possible.      For these reasons it is generally the practice to carry out a complete re-signallingof the line while it is being electrified.     this involves the provision of track circuiting through-out, the replacement of semaphore signals by a muchgreater number of colour lights and the centralis-atlon of traffic control at large centres in theinterests of labour economy and free traffic flow.The programme of work for signalling is inaccordance with the overall time-table for elcctri-fication already set out in Section 2,(b) Installation of Automatic Train ControlPlans are being made for automatic train control to be provided on the main traffic routes through-out the country.During the period 1956-1962, the following routeswill be equippedLondon (King&apos;s Cross) via Newcastle to Edinburgh.London (Euston) to Glasgow (including manchester and Liverpool).Edinburgh to Glasgow.London (Waterloo) to Bournemouth and Exeter,London (Liverpool Street) to Norwich,
(d) Other Signalling Modernisation WorksWork programmed under this heading covers theprovision of track circuiting and colour lightsignalling in a large number of localities, wherethe existing signalling systems are inadequate todeal efficiently with the higher speeds andfrequency of the future services.In addition, the schemes provide for more economicaloperation by the replacement of numbers of outmodedmanually operated signal boxes by single modernpower boxes.(e) The telecommunications.system - network of british railways is inadequate to deal with modern conditions.The plans provide for an automatic &quot;on demand&quot;service between all important points.      Many years will elapse before the work can be completed.      Acommencement will be made by the concentration,in important localities, of several exchanges into one automatic exchange, and by increasing telephoneroute capacity where most needed.Intense study is being given to the extended useof teleprinter services, and- of the application ofelectronic devices to the gathering, storage and presentation of control information.It is expected that the level of expenditureon Signal Engineering work will.build up to about  12million a year by 1958 and thereafter continue at aboutthe same level.      This will require a considerable expansion in the output of Signalling manufacturers and Contractors, who are aware of the need.
