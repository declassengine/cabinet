Printed for the Cabinet. August 1956SECRET Copy No. 5 UCP. (56) 20429th August, 1956CABINETTHE GOLD COASTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies seek the concurrence of my colleagues to make an early announcement thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government will now introduce into Parliament a Gold CoastIndependence Bill and that subject to its passage through Parliament the gold coast will be accorded independence within the Commonwealth on 6th March,1957 or as soon as possible thereafter. I would prefer to call this self-government within the Commonwealth. Wherever possible I am trying to use (and get accepted)the words &quot; self-government &quot; for &quot; independence.&quot; But as I have previouslyexplained to my colleagues, it is too late to use these more reassuring words in thecase of the Gold Coast.Recent Developments2. The Cabinet last discussed the question of Gold Coast independence on 3rd May (CM. (56) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 8). With their approval I announced in the House of Commons on 11th May that, if a general election was held in theGold Coast, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready to accept a motion calling for independence within the Commonwealth passed by a reasonable majority ina newly elected Legislature and that they would then declare a firm date for independence.  The text of my statement is at Annex A.3. A general election was held on 12th and 17th July. It was observed by six members of Parliament drawn from both sides of the House. They have reported that they were satisfied that the election was conducted fairly and properlyand in an orderly manner.4. As a result. Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s party (the Convention Peoples&apos; Party) wasreturned to power with only a slightly reduced majority. They now hold 72 out ofthe 104 seats in the new Legislative Assembly and, although there was only a50 per cent, poll, they won 57 per cent, of the votes cast throughout the territory.5. Although the C.P.P. is strongest in the &quot; Colony &quot; or coastal area, whereDr. Nkrumah won all 44 seats and about 81 per cent, of the total votes cast,popular support for the CP.P. was not limited to that area. In other Regionsthey obtained the following proportions of seats and votes:  Ashanti 8 out of 21 seats and 43 per cent, of total votes cast;Northern Territories 11 out of 26 seats and 45 per cent, of total votes cast;Trans-Volta Togoland 9 out of 13 seats and over 55 per cent, of total votes cast.6. The new Legislative Assembly was opened on 31st July, and on 3rd August the Government introduced its expected motion calling for independence within the Commonwealth. All the Opposition members boycottedthe debate (see paragraph 1.1 below) and the motion was passed nem con.  If there50424 b
2had been a vote, the Opposition could not have mustered more than 32 votes againstthe Governments 72. I must regard the motion therefore as having been passedby a &quot; reasonable majority.&quot;- - 7.   The full text of the motion reads as follows:-...........&quot; that this Assembly do authorise the Government of the Gold Coast to request Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom, as soon aspracticable this year, to procure the enactment by the United kingdom parliament of an Act to provide for independence of the Gold Coast as a sovereign and independent State within the Commonwealth under the nameof Ghana.&quot;8. The Governor has informed me that despite the wording of the motionthe Gold Coast Government will not object if independence should be deferred until the early months of 1957. In fact it has long been understood that6th March (which is the anniversary of the signing of the Bond of 1844 from which british power and jurisdiction is generally derived) would be particularly acceptable to local opinion.9. Two main questions arise. The first is the strength of the opposition and the second concerns corruption in public life in the Gold Coast.The Opposition10. The Opposition Parties won considerably less support in the electionthan they had hoped. They obtained only 31 of &quot;the 104 seats in the assembly and have the support of one independent member. By Regions, the totalnon-C.P.P. vote in the Colony was 19 per cent., in Ashanti 57 per cent., inTrans-Volta Togoland 45 per cent., and in the Northern Territories 55 per cent.Thus even in Ashanti (the stronghold of the National Liberation Movement, whichis the most articulate section of the Opposition), they obtained nothing likeoverwhelming support.11. Since the election, the Opposition groups have indicated that they intend to boycott the Legislative Assembly until their demand for a federal constitutionhas been met... As I informed my colleagues on 3rd May, however, I do notconsider it practicable at this stage to operate a federal system in the Gold Coast.Moreover I consider that the Gold Coast Governmenfs published constitutional proposals (which are based on the recommendations of the Constitutional Adviserappointed at my request last year) make reasonable concessions to regional feeling;they provide for a single chamber Legislature at the centre as at present but forthe addition of Regional Assemblies with limited powers. The general electionwas held expressly to resolve the deadlock created by the difference of view betweenthe Government and Opposition Parties, and was fought largely on theconstitutional issue. As indicated, the CP.P. won a large majority over the wholeof the country, and my announced undertaking to Dr. Nkrumah (Annex A) didnot qualify the expression &quot; reasonable majority &quot; by any reference to the Regions.Disturbing though the Opposition^ intransigent attitude is, there are no legitimategrounds on which I could withdraw or postpone carrying out my publicundertaking, nor do I think that such a course, even if practicable, would bejustified or would promote a settlement.12. Both the Governor and I have firmly impressed on Dr. Nkrumah (andwill continue to do so) the importance of recognising minority rights and of makingconcessions to opposition opinion. The Governor has recently told me that he still hopes to bring the Parties together to discuss the question of regionaldevolution. Whether or not this leads to any modification of the Gold CoastGovernmenfs present constitutional proposals, it is clearly impossible for us to withhold independence on this account. Dr. Nkrumah&apos;s political opponents havethe parliamentary and intellectual strength to form an effective parliamentary opposition if they would only face their responsibilites in the proper constitutionalway. I shall see that a delegation which they are sending to London are urged to follow that course. It must be hoped (though I&apos;m afraid without muchconfidence) that responsibility and experience wili gradually bring about an atmosphere of greater political toleration in the country.13. It is not expected that the political conflict within the Gold Coast will seriously affect public security there before independence. If it did, it shouldnot be beyond the power of the local forces of law and order to control the trouble.
Corruption - ,. , -14. I have been seriously concerned about corruption in public life in theGold Coast (one of the issues upon which the Opposition there have fastened).The Report of a recent Commission of Enquiry into the activities of the CocoaPurchasing Company clearly establishes that the Company was used by theGovernment for Party purposes and that the Prime Minister and Finance minister were both implicated by having condoned and connived at irregularities. Muchof the money in the hands of the Cocoa Purchasing Company comes from cocoagrowers in Ashanti. Their indignation at the use of their cash to help financetheir political opponents is, to put it mildly, understandable. As my colleagues know,I have recently had to insist on an enquiry in Nigeria into, the/relations betweenthe Premier of the Eastern Region and the Continental Bank, and the conference to discuss the next constitutional steps in Nigeria has been postponed pendingthe enquiry; though there is the important difference that in the Gold Coast case there is no suggestion of Ministers being personally corrupt. At my request theGovernor has taken up with Dr. Nkrumah the serious situation created by theCocoa Commission Report. As I have said to the Governor, I am obliged tobear in mind the impact which the Report will make on public opinion here andin other parts of the Commonwealth and the consequent need for it to bedemonstrable beyond reasonable doubt that the Gold Coast Governmentunderstands the seriousness of the Commission^ findings and is determined to remedy the abuses which have been disclosed. I am glad to say that Dr. Nkrumahhas now (on 22nd August) made a statement in the Legislative Assembly tothe effect that the Report will be published very shortly with a statement of theGovernments proposals in respect of its recommendations. He has promised theAssembly a full opportunity to discuss the Report and the Governments proposals.I understand from the Governor that the Report is expected to be published by31st August, and that Dr. Nkrumah proposes to carry out most of its recommendations. I do not think we could look for more. I do not consider thatthe Report gives us grounds for going back on the undertaking I gave on1.1th May, or should deter us from going ahead with the announcement of independence. I propose therefore that the announcement should be made atsome time after the Cocoa Purchasing Commission Report is published but before15th September, beyond which date the Governor advises me that it would bedifficult to hold the position.The Protectorate15. The Northern Territories, unlike the rest of the Gold Coast, are aProtectorate, where we have Treaties with the Chiefs dating from the later years,of the 19th century. During the last few years the Chiefs have, from time to time,argued that the existence of these Treaties could, and should, operate as a meansof staying the grant of independence to the Gold Coast as a whole until such time as the successors to the signatories of those Treaties agreed to their abrogation.At a meeting with the Chiefs in May 1956 the Governor, with the authority ofHer Majes:ty&apos;s Government, explained that Her Majesty&apos;s Government could not reasonably be expected to regard it as consistent with their policy of constitutional development .to allow the Treaties to prevent or delay the attainment by the gold coast of full self-government; he pointed out that the North was already taking part in the political institutions of the country as a whole; and of course it has sinceparticipated in the general election. The Governor formed the impression fromhis meeting with the Chiefs that they had accepted the fact that they could notretain then protectorate status, though there is no doubt they are still not unnaturally suspicious of an independent African government.Togoland16. In May a plebiscite was held under United Nations auspices in the trust territory of British Togoland, the choice being between the following questions : -(1) Do you want the integration of Togoland under British administrationwith an independent Gold Coast?(2) Do you want the separation of Togoland under British administrationfrom the Gold Coast and its continuation under trusteeship pending theultimate determination of its political future?50424 b 2
The proportion of registered voters who participated was 82 per cent.; 58 per cent,of the votes cast were in favour of the first alternative; the actual voting was93,095 to 67,492. In July the Trusteeship Council passed &quot;a resolution noting thatthe will of the majority of the inhabitants was for union with an independentGold Coast and recommending &quot; that appropriate steps be taken in consultationwith the administering authority for the termination of the Trusteeship agreement for the Territory to become effective upon the attainment of independence bythe Gold Coast.&quot; It is expected that this recommendation will be considered and,I imagine, endorsed by the General Assembly of the United Nations in November.Commonwealth Membership17. It has been explained to Dr. Nkrumah that &quot; independence within theCommonwealth &quot; does not of itself convey membership of the commonwealth and that the latter requires the consent of all existing members. The PrimeMinister wrote to the other Commonwealth Prime Ministers in July about gold coast membership of the Commonwealth, asking them whether they would agree in principle to accept an application for Commonwealth membership from theGold Coast on the assumption that self-government was reached. If they agreed,it was proposed to send a further message when the question of membership hadbeen raised and had become actual. All the Prime Ministers have in effectconveyed their agreement although the Union Prime Minister has done sogrudgingly. The stage for a further message has not yet come; and I propose thatwe should consider its timing and form nearer the date of independence.Recommendations18. The conditions in my statement of 11th May have been fulfilled and inmy view we are therefore committed to accepting the request of the new gold coast Government and Assembly for early independence. I accordingly recommend that (a) we should iniorm the Gold Coast Government forthwith that her majesty&apos;s Government will at the first available opportunity introduce into Parliament a Bill to accord independence to the Gold Coast, andthat, subject to Parliamentary approval, it is the intention of her majesty&apos;s Government that independence should take effect on 6th March, 1957;(b) I should make this decision public during the first fortnight of September(subject to (c) below) by means of a statement in Parliament (if sitting);otherwise by publication of a despatch to the Governor;(c) other Commonwealth Governments should be given prior notice of our intention to proceed as in (a) and (b) above, our High Commissionersbeing given suitable briefing;id) the Cabinet should without further preliminaries authorise thepreparation of the Bill required under (a) above and should invite theLegislation Committee to consider, as a matter of urgency, the stepsneeded to give it the requisite time and facilities early in the next session. The Bill would be in the same general form as the CeylonIndependence Act of 1947, and would provide, in accordance with localwishes, that the name of the country should be GHANA. provisions would have to be included to cover the incorporation in this newcountry of the Protectorate and Togoland, which are not at present partof Her Majesty&apos;s dominions; the precise form of these provisionspresents some technical difficulty and is still being studied;(e) the question of Commonwealth membership should be taken up separatelyas indicated in paragraph 17 above.A. L.-B.Colonial Office, S.W. 1,27th August, 1956.
ANNEX a text OF PARLIAMENTARY  STATEMENT,   11th  MAY,   1956With permission I wish to make a statement about certain developments inthe Gold Coast.As the House knows, the present Gold Coast Constitution marked the laststage before the assumption by the Gold Coast of full responsibility for its own affairs. The grant of such responsibility is a matter for the United KingdomGovernment and Parliament and it has always been the wish of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom that the Gold Coast should achieve itsindependence within the Commonwealth.Since the present Constitution was introduced there has arisen a disputewithin the Gold Coast about, the form of Constitution which that country shouldhave when it achieves independence within the Commonwealth.Efforts have been made to bring about a reconciliation betv/een the majorparties but they have so far met with no success.I have been in close touch with the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast on thesematters. It is the considered view of his Government that the time has now comefor the Gold Coast to assume full responsibility within the Commonwealth for itsown affairs. I have made my view clear to him that, because of the failure to resolve the Constitutional dispute we can only achieve our common aim of theearly independence of that country within the Commonwealth in one way and inone way alone; that is to demonstrate to the world that the peoples of the gold coast have had a full and free opportunity to consider their Constitution and toexpress their views on it in a general election. I have told Dr. Nkrumah that ifa general election is held Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be ready to accept a motion calling for independence within the Commonwealth passed by a reasonablemajority in a newly-elected Legislature and then to declare a firm date for thispurpose.Full membership of the Commonwealth is of course a different question andis a matter for consultation between all existing members of the Commonwealth.
