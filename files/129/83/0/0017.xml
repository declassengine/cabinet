confidential.p.(56) 21724th September, 1956CAPITULATORY RIGHTS IN MOROCCOMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsUnder a Treaty signed with the independent Sultan of Morocco in1856, Her Majesty&apos;s Government acquired certain capitulatory rightsinside Morocco.    They were modified in 1923 for the Tangier Zone andrenounced in 1937 for the French Zone.     On the authorisation ofSir Anthony Eden (then Foreign Secretary) negotiations were started in1952 in Madrid to renounce them in the Spanish Zone also.2.      Now that Morocco is reunited and independent, the continued existence of these rights in certain provinces of the State is an anachronismeven more embarrassing than it was before.     I therefore propose to beginnegotiations for an agreement with the Moroccan Government, on the same lines as the negotiations begun in 1952 with the Spanish Government.copy no.
