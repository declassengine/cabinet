Printed for the Cabinet.  September 1956SECRETCP. (56) 2055th September, 1956CABINETTHE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF MALTAMemorandum by the Minister of defence at their meeting on 20th July, 1956, the Cabinet took note (CM. (56)51st Conclusions, Item 7) of a Memorandum by the Colonial Secretary(CP. (56) 169) which discussed the possible constitutional alternatives to integrationfor Malta. I was invited to ask the Chiefs of Staff whether in the light of theColonial Secretary&apos;s Memorandum they had anything to add to their previousappreciations of Malta&apos;s strategic value to the United Kingdom. Their reply is annexed. I endorse their conclusion that the strategic value of Malta has increased during the past year and in the foreseeable future is likely to increase rather thandecrease.2.   I invite my colleagues to take note of this paper.W. M.Ministry of Defence, S.W. 1,5th September, 1956.annex the STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF MALTAIntroduction1. British strategic interests in the Mediterranean are centred on ensuring the security of vital Commonwealth sea and air communications. We haveobligations to support N.A.T.O., the Baghdad Pact, Jordan, Libya and the tripartite Declaration of 1950, all of which contribute to the stability of the area.To meet these commitments it is necessary to station British forces in theMediterranean.Bases in the Mediterranean2. No one base in the Mediterranean can meet all the requirements of thethree Services. Libya and Cyprus between them accommodate the land and themajority of the air forces normally required in peace. Gibraltar can accommodate the maritime forces but it is badly placed for exerting influence in the Middle East.Malta is, however, well placed and equipped as a base for naval forces; it has goodairfields, but can only accommodate limited land forces. If the three Services areto play their part in the Mediterranean then the retention of Malta as a maritimebase is essential.Copy  No. 5 250486
2Malta as a Base in Peace3. The strategic importance of Malta has been relatively increased by the lossof facilities in Egypt and the Levant. It is also a most important link in the british air routes to the Middle East and the Far East. There exist in Malta extensivefacilities for command, supply, repair, training and recreation which cannotreadily be found elsewhere in the Mediterranean. There is, in addition, a supplyof technically-trained labour. The British contribution to N.A.T.O. in theMediterranean is centred on the organisation of CINCAFMED, whoseHeadquarters, together with the comprehensive communications, is strategicallywell sited in Malta.Malta as a Base in Global War4. If global war occurs Malta might well be the target for nuclear orconventional air attack. However, as it is not planned to use it as a strategicbomber base the probability of nuclear attack is reduced. The possibility couldbe further reduced by dispersing the N.A.T.O. maritime forces, but in view of the effort being expended in strengthening the facilities for command Malta will remain the first choice for the centre of maritime command in the Mediterranean.5. The acceptance by N.A.T.O. of the new strategy which is being proposedby the United Kingdom would not, we consider, reduce the importance of Malta,since CINCAFMED&apos;s command is a visible sign of N.A.T.O.&apos;s preparedness to resist aggression.Malta as a Base in Limited War6. The unsettled political climate in the Mediterranean and Middle Eastmay force us to relinquish our treaty rights to station forces in Libya. It isalready clear that we cannot use our Libyan bases for mounting operations against any other Arab State. In addition, political developments could at any timeradically alter the strategic value of Cyprus. Should these two eventualities occurwe would be left with Malta and Gibraltar as our only Mediterranean bases.7. The present situation over the Suez Canal emphasises the importance of malta in the mounting and launching of any limited war operations in theMediterranean and Middle East. The success of any limited war operation in theFar East will depend to a large extent on the use which the United Kingdomcan make of the Mediterranean sea and air routes. If we are denied the free useof Malta, the lack of the excellent facilities for the command and support of militaryoperations would gravely prejudice the prosecution of a limited war in the middle east and, to a lesser extent, the Far East.conclusion. We conclude that the strategic value of Malta has increased during thepast year and, in the foreseeable future, is likely to increase rather than decrease.
