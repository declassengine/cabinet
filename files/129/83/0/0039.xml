SECRETCP.(56) 23917th October, 1956.LONG-TERM ASSURANCES FOR AGRICULTURENote by the Minister of Agriculture, fisheries and food share the Chancellor&apos;s disappointment that the proposals on long-term assurances for agriculture now before us do not get rid ofthe annual difficulties for us inherent in annual reviews at which anumber of major factors have to be taken into account without anyprecise rules.     But, although I had hoped that this might in some waybe possible, the aim of the present discussions, as stated publicly in theAnnual Review White Paper and in the House, is to provide more effective long-term assurances to agriculture in order to reduce the lack of confidence among farmers.    This arises not so much from the bargaining at annual reviews as from their short-term nature and fromthe existing unrealistic and limited guarantees of minimum prices.Inevitably, implementation of the White Paper undertaking involves&quot;giving&quot; by the Government.2.      Our fundamental problem is this.     During the past four years or so we have made great efforts to &quot;sell&quot; to the farmers the presentsubsidy arrangements and the return to free markets.    But theupheavals have been so great that we have not succeeded.     I must tellmy colleagues that in my judgment   unless we can take a major newstep to restore confidence, the present restlessness and dissatisfactionamong farmers will reach a point where there will be a general revoltagainst our present policies.3.      If we are to provide a basis for confidence which will avoid this and enable the efficient development of the industry to proceed, itis essential to introduce new arrangements which will be acceptedby the Unions as an adequate long-term reassurance.     The influence of the Farmers&apos; Unions is sufficiently effective to ensure that what their leaders tell the farmers is all right will be considered all rightby farmers - and vice versa.       A forthright statement from the Unionsthat the agreed arrangements fulfil the object of the discussions willbe necessary,   and will be the return we shall obtain for what we shallbe giving.   It will be a major success for us if we can get arrangements that both we and the Unions together put forward as constituting asatisfactory foundation for long-term planning in the industry and for the government&apos;s long-term policy.COPY NO.CABINET
JL u 04.       The proposals now before us are reasonable in themselves.   So faras they foster re-equipment they will provide a strong reinforcement toour policy of improving efficiency.   There is a good chance that they willbe acceptable to the leaders of the Farmers&apos; Unions and will thereforesecure our essential objective.5.      I conclude that comprehensive  proposals on the lines put forwardare essential if our political and economic objectives are to be realised;and that we should go forward with them.d.K.A.Ministry of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, S.W.117th October, 1956-2-
