Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1956CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (56) 2233rd October, 1956CABINETELECTRICITY supply memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and power on 2nd August, the Cabinet agreed to consider separately the case for theproposed Electricity Bill before finally deciding on the content of the next session&apos;slegislative programme (CM. (56) 57th Conclusions, Minute 2(f)). Thismemorandum summarises a case which has been reinforced in my mind by recent experience.2. Nuclear power offers our one hope of eventually regaining a large measureof our former independence of the outside world for vital supplies of fuel. Themain instrument to which we have to look for the realisation of this hope is theCentral Electricity Authority (C.E.A.). However rapid the advances which maybe made by the Atomic Energy Authority (A.E.A.) in the field of nuclear research,it is the C.E.A. the body statutorily charged with the generation of electricity that must bring the results of the A.E.A.&apos;s researches to fruition.3. The rapid development of nuclear power requires that the C.E.A. shouldlive in cordial relationship with the A.E.A., should be quick to follow on the latter&apos;sdiscoveries, and should be both flexible and bold in its investment plans.4. It has become increasingly apparent to me that the C.E.A., as at present constituted, is far from meeting these requirements. One of the reasons for thislies in its organisation, which is described by the Herbert Committee as having&quot; developed certain stresses and strains which have militated against increased efficiency, and which in our opinion can have a still more deleterious effect in thefuture.&quot; In particular the double responsibility placed on the C.E.A. by the presentstatute the C.E.A. exercises a general supervision over distribution as well asbeing responsible for generation means that there is no body giving to theproblems of generation the single-minded attention which our circumstances nowdemand.5. I wish to remedy this defect by establishing, among other things, a boardspecifically charged with generation. I have it in mind to propose some element ofcommon membership between this board and the A.E.A., the better to ensureco-operation between them. This step, however, cannot be taken without legislation, and I suggest that the implications are such that the legislation will notbrook delay.6. There are also other reasons why the legislation should be now rather thanlater. The present appointments of the Chairman and of one of the two deputy chairmen of the C.E.A. expire in August 1957. The Chairman will then be 70 andthe Deputy Chairman 67. Clearly new appointments should be made. But howcan they properly be made when the future organisation is still unknown? Thechange of organisation must come first.7. Finally, the recommendations of the Herbert Committee with regard tomany matters, such as the internal organisation of area distribution boards, do notnecessitate legislation. I shall soon be compelled to announce decisions with regar.d50589
to these. But it will, I suggest, indicate an inversion of values and be a standinginvitation to criticism if we act on the Committee&apos;s secondary recommendationswhile delaying action on its primary one.,: 8. I would not wish needlessly to burden the legislative programme: But thepublication of the Herbert Report has created uncertainty about the- structure ofthis industry. A continuance of this uncertainty must add still further. to theinefficiency which the Report has diagnosed. I submit that we cannot afford theseconsequences in the organisation on which we count to mitigate our. heavydependence on coal and Middle Eastern oil.A. J.Ministry of Fuel and Power, S.W. 1,2nd October, 1956.
