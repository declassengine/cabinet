Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1956SECRET Copy No,CP. (56) 2224th October, 1956CABINETNUCLEAR RADIATIONS: PUBLIC control memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department and minister for Welsh AffairsParagraph 102 of the Statement on Defence, 1956, alluded to the severerestrictions on movement put of doors that the radio-active fajl-put from ground-burst nuclear weapqns would entail, and paragraph 104 went on to promise that special attention would be given to informing the public both about the effects ofmermo-nuclear attack and of the measures that can be taken to counter them.2. A pamphlet giving the facts about nuclear weapons was placed on salein January; a popular version intended for the man-in-the-street is in preparation.But so far we have published little or nothing of our plans and proposals for measures to counter the radio-active effects of nuclear weapons. Both the Secretaryof State for Scotland and I believe that our provisional proposals for control ofthe public under fall-out conditions should now be published. These proposals are contained ira the attached Memorandum, and I invite authority to issue it.3. Briefly, the scheme outlined in the Memorandum provides for the controlof the public by the division of the contaminated area into zones, called for convenience, W, X, Y and Z, the boundaries of which would be determined inrelation to the intensity of contamination as measured on the ground. The basicinformation would come from Royal Observer Corps posts and be supplementedas necessary by the local civil defence organisation. Zone Z would be the most highly contaminated zone, and there would be no alternative to removing everyonewithin it; this movement would be planned to start after 48 hours had elapsedfrom the time of burst. In Zones X and Y, the emphasis would be on peoplestaying where they were, but, if they were not to become sick, restrictions on thetime they could spend out of doors after an initial period of 48 hours in refugeaccommodation would be inevitable. Thus in Zone Y they would be restricted to 2 hours per day in the open for the next 12 days and 4 hours for the rest ofthe first month; in Zone X to 4 hours per day for 5 days only; while in Zone Wthey would be freed of all restraint within 48 hours.4. The scheme outlined in the Memorandum has emerged from discussions and studies among the Departments and Services affected and its broad outlinesare already becoming known as a result of courses at the Civil Defence Staff college and elsewhere. What is now required is to go a stage further and make the schememore widely available especially among local and other authorities and the civil defence services. The conceptions embodied in the Memorandum are new andmight excite some public interest; but this can easily be over estimated. Neitherthe publication of &quot; Nuclear Weapons &quot; nor, in a different field, the recent Armyexercise &quot; Try-out &quot; produced any significant public reaction. The fact is that the likely extent of the area that might be contaminated by a ground-burst megatonweapon and the degree of persistence of radio-activity have made very little impact on the general public. The implications of the immobility imposed by fall-out and the resulting strain on people, especially in households providing billets forevacuees, are not appreciated; nor are the cumulative doses of radio-activity whichwould be inevitable for large sections of the population, even assuming compliance
with the control rules. Public awareness of these things will grow as time goes on and it is necessary that civil defence publications should deal in realistic terms with the conditions that would result from nuclear warfare. There is no reasonto suppose that the Government would derive anything but credit from makingknown our proposals for bringing the catastrophic situation that might arise under some sort of control. The Memorandum might in fact do a great deal to counteract the widespread belief that nothing at all could be done to mitigate theeffects of radio-active fall-out.5. It has been suggested that the&apos; issue of the Memorandum might stimulatean unwelcome interest in some of the more sensitive aspects of home defence policy. The Memorandum certainly indicates the kind of conditions to be expected in fall-out areas, and, by implication, makes apparent how much survival would depend on other preparations. But these conclusions are already there to be drawn from the picture given in the last two Statements on Defence.6. The Secretary of State for Scotland and I regard it as an essentialminimum, if realistic civil defence planning is to continue at all, that theMemorandum should be made available to local authorities and others concernedwith home defence, such as public utilities and industrial managements.7. I suggest, however, that in addition to issuing the Memorandum for official civil defence purposes, there would be advantage in placing it on unrestrictedsale.to the public: There is nothing of a classified nature in it and its contentswill become fairly widely known in any case. To make it generally available wouldbe a worthwhile step in our programme for educating the general public to whichprominence was given in this year&apos;s &quot; Statement on Defence.&quot; Self-help by thepublic will be vital under fall-out conditions; self-help must be based on knowledge and the present Memorandum will help to spread knowledge of the conditions and what can be done to meet them.8; Fall-out would create serious difficulties for the various specialist interestsand services and in the main these will be dealt with in memoranda prepared bythe responsible Departments as time goes on. Outstanding among these interests,however, is agriculture, and the Ministry of Agriculture in consultation with a jointcommittee of the Agricultural and Medical Research Councils and the development commission have prepared a &quot; Farmers&apos; Handbook &quot; intended to inform the farming community about fall-out and the practical action farmers could take toreduce the damage it would cause. It is contemplated that the Farmers&apos;Handbook should be published at, or about, the same time as the home departments Memorandum. It has been discussed in draft with the United states authorities who are issuing a similar document in the near future.9.   I invite the Cabinet:  (a) to approve the issue of the provisional scheme of public control underfall-out conditions for civil defence purposes (paragraph 6);(b) to agree that the Memorandum should also be placed on sale to the public(paragraph 7);(c) to take note of the suggested publication of a Farmers&apos; Handbook onfall-out (paragraph 8).G. LL.-G.,   Home Office, S.W. I,Hiv:2   . 1st October, 1956.
