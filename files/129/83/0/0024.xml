secret.P.(56) 2242nd October, 1956CABINETAUSTRALIA:   TRADE TALKSMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and food the discussions with the Australian Ministers, aiming at a comprehensive trade agreement, were adjourned in July(CM.(56) 52nd Meeting, Item 4) so that we might examine &quot;how best wideropportunities can be secured for the expansion of traditional Australianexports to the United Kingdom, especially wheat&quot;.2.     It was clear from the outset of the talks that some arrangement inregard to wheat sales to this country would be an important element in asettlement.   I have examined, therefore, with the President of the Boardof Trade, the Commonwealth Secretary and the Economic Secretary ofthe Treasury four possible ways of increasing our imports of australian wheat:(i)  by imposing quota restrictions on imports of wheat and flourfrom all sources except Australia;(ii)  by introducing statutory control over the composition of the loaf;(iii) by charging countervailing duties on imports of subsidised wheat;(iv) by securing a voluntary arrangement with the millers and the grain trade to use their best endeavours to take a specifiedminimum quantity of Australian wheat.There are the most formidable objections to the first three methods andwe are satisfied that the fourth - a voluntary arrangement with the graintrade to use their best endeavours to take a specified minimum - while initself restrictive, would do the least damage to our other interests and Istrongly recommend that we should concentrate our efforts on this method.3.     Such an arrangement would clearly improve the prospects for australian wheat in the United Kingdom market, it would represent thebest attempt we could make to meet Australia&apos;s difficulties and we couldexplain that our own farmers in regard to quality enjoy no more favourablean arrangement.   But we must recognise that it would fall short of theAustralian request as regards the firmness of the commitment and alsothe quantity.COPY NO. 4
JL di i4.    As regards quantity, the Australians have asked for a guaranteedmarket for 40 million bushels (1. 1 million tons).   Against this, the millers have provisionally offered a &quot;best endeavours&quot; undertaking of750,000 tons, or, as a last resort^ 850,000 tons.   (This is in addition totheir commitment to take 1.25 million tons of English wheat. )  The only way to increase this quantity would be to get the compounders of animalfeedingstuffs to take, say, 150,000 tons per annum.   Some of this wouldbe at the expense of feed wheat from Canada; and the compounders would need a subsidy to compensate them for the higher price.   Apart from theresentment of Canada at an import subsidy paid by the British taxpayer on imported Australian wheat, there would be many technical difficultiesof public accountability to be overcome.   These problems are now beingmost urgently examined in consultation with the trades concerned, but itis too early to say whether a defensible scheme could be worked out.5t     It is now proposed that officials should be authorised in the resumednegotiations to indicate that a &quot;best endeavours&quot; arrangement is apossibility and to see whether it has any attractions for the Australiansand what benefits we can obtain for it.   Once on the table, however, theprinciple of a &quot;best endeavours&quot; arrangement could not be withdrawn ifit was acceptable to the Australians; and if accepted it would have important consequences.6,     Some of these consequences would be -(a) It would be a departure from the policy of freeing trade from government control and interference.   Also, it would not be consistent with the objective we have pursued for some years of bringing down theprice of wheat, because by narrowing sources of supply it would tend toincrease import prices and the cost of living.(b) It might encourage similar requests for undertakings for other commodities or other countries.   It would be difficult to limit theprinciple to wheat only.(c) It would affect the home farmer.   The millers might buy rather less than the 1. 5 million tons English wheat they are now taking, and theywould certainly not increase their commitment of 1. 25 million tons as theNational Farmers&apos; Union is now urging that they should do.(d) As our High Commissioner in Canada has already indicated, therewould be strong criticism in Canada of what would be regarded as adiscriminatory arrangement.   The Canadians would claim that their exports would be adversely affected, that the arrangement would be contrary to our international obligations and to our professed aims.(e) There is a danger that the Canadians would ask for a similar&quot;best endeavours&quot; arrangement.   The first answer to this would be thatthe Canadians do not &quot;bind&quot; their preferences as the Australian preferencesare bound, but there is a risk that the Canadian Government in an electionyear and under pressure from the wheat growing interests would threaten to reduce their preferences unless some corresponding arrangement couldbe made.   Even if the millers could be constrained to give an undertaking to Canada its effect would be most seriously to restrict international competition, with the inevitable effect on prices.-2-
7.     I recognise the need to reach a satisfactory general agreement with australia.   If this involves a commitment in respect of wheat I am satisfied that the least damaging device would be a voluntary arrangement with the trade, but before endorsing even this arrangement I have felt that my colleagues ought to be aware of the serious drawbacks from the pointof view of our commercial and agricultural policies.H.A.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S.W.I.2nd October, 1956
