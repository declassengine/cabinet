CONFIDENTIALDocument is the property of her Britannic majesty&apos;s governmentc(79) 5copy no 7615 May 1979cabinetCASH LIMITSMemorandum bv the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. We have strongly supported the use of cash limits to control publicexpenditure.    We will want to maintain and, where possible, reinforcethem.    I will be reviewing the range of services to which the previousGovernment applied cash limits and will bring forward in due course anyproposals I have for extending it.2.        As the Cabinet are aware, the cash limits, once set, represent themaximum to be spent on the services covered, and Departments areexpected to manage their programmes so as to keep within the limits.The majority of voted cash limits (including Rate Support Grants) are nowco-terminous with the Parliamentary Votes, and Supplementary Estimateshave to be presented and approved by Parliament to give effect to anyincreases.    I ask my colleagues to ensure that the limits are rigorouslyobserved by their Departments.the 1979-80 cash limits3. The previous Government published cash limits for 1979-80 beforethe Dissolution.    But they left a number of loose ends on pay which we mustnow tie up.    We will best support the cash limits system by announcing inthe Budget the basis on which we have decided to operate the cash limits forthe current year and then to hold to this basis*4. For expenditure other than pay, the published cash limits providefor price increases based on the Industry Act forecast published lastNovember.    Price increases are likely to turn out higher than this. Itshould be possible to absorb a squeeze up to 4 - 5 per cent:  provided thatthe post-Budget forecasts do not indicate a larger squeeze than this, Iconclude that there is no need to review the published cash limits on thisaccount.    For each percentage point by which prices exceed the provisionin the cash limits, the squeeze on central government, and local authoritycapital, expenditure amounts to  135 million at 1979 survey prices: thereis also a squeeze on local authority current expenditure through the cashlimits on the Rate Support Grants (RSG), but the effect of this is uncertainsince localauthorities appear to have rated on a scale sufficient to coversuch price increases.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. On pay, the previous Government set the cash limit on the basis oftheir 5 per cent policy which proved untenable.    As a result they had tomake a number of commitments to adjust the published cash limits and somesettlements were reached on that understanding.LOCAL, AUTHORITIES6. In the local authority field, the cash limit is on the JlSCt, ^rlaitria.fcrieeta &apos;61 per cent of local authority current expenditure in England andWales (68^ per cent in Scotland).    The previous Government agreed toraise the cash limits to cover the Governments share of the settlementwith the manuals, including the cost of the outcome of the comparabilitystudy.    They made a similar offer in respect of the teachers, but nosettlement was reached in that case.    The only major remainingnegotiation   in this round is for the white collar workers.7. The local authorities appear to have set their rates on a scalewhich will not leave them short of funds, even if no further help isgiven through the RSG.    But it would cause difficulty to go back oncommitments already given, and we agreed last week that we shouldraise the RSG cash limits to the small extent necessary to cover ourshare of the cost of making the full increase in policy pay immediately:most of our share will be covered by the 50 per cent specific grant forthe police, on which there is no cash limit.8. The Chancellor and I recommend that, rather than discriminatebetween past and future settlements, we should be ready to increase theRSG so as to contribute our normal share of settlements.    Depending onthe outcome of comparability, this could add  300 million to the RSG cashlimits.    But this would not be incompatible with calling for volumereductions in local authorities&apos; spending to provide offsetting economiestowards the cost of pay settlements and towards meeting our budgetaryproblems.    My paper on public expenditure reductions in the Budgetcontains a proposal to make such a call to local authorities and to reinforceit by cutting back the increases in the RSG proposed above.CENTRAL GOVERNMENT9. The main pay groups financed directly by Central Government arecivil servants, the National Health Service, the armed forces and theuniversities.    Here too the previous Government made some commitments.10. The health authorities were told that, in addition to the volumesqueeze resulting from higher prices, they would be expected to meet partof the cost of higher pay settlements by reducing the volumo of theirexpenditure in 1979-80 by  24 million (at 1979 Survey prices). Subjectto this, the cash limit would be increased to cover the cost of settlements,including any costs resulting from the decisions we have yet to take on thereport of the Review Board on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; remuneration.Depending on the outcome of comparability, this would involve raising the2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpresent cash limit by  200 -  250 million.    I propose that we should holdto this for this year unless the cost of the comparability awards is muchhigher than we expect, but in the medium term I hope we can press forlarger administrative savings.11. The universities were told that the cash limit on their recurrentgrant would be raised to cover the extra cost of the 9 per cent settlementreached with their teaching staff and technicians.    As the settlement wasreached on that basis, it can hardly be re-opened.    For the settlementwith their manual workers however tb.a ccrresponding increase in therecurrent grant was to be 2 percentage points less than the pay increase.12. On the armed forces, we are committed to implementing in full theaward recommended by the Armed Forces Pay Review Board. We agreedlast week to raise the defence cash limit accordingly by some  270 million.13. On the Civil Service, the difference between the pay award to thenon-industrial Civil Service and the provision in the published cash limitsis some 10 per cent, equivalent this year to  270 million or the full yearcost of over 50, 000 staff.    The settlement for industrial staff, due from1 July, is likely to add a further cost.    This is too big a gap to be bridgedby manpower economies in the current year,14. The Lord President is bringing forward proposals for a temporaryban on recruitment and for a target for savings in staff costs in eachDepartment in the current year;  and on a procedure for setting cash limitsin the light of the target.    It is essential that these cash limits, like others,should represent an absolute upper limit on expenditure and be set at levelswhich can be firmly held,    I propose that we should adopt the same approachas for the Civil Service in reviewing the cash limits on finance for fringebodies.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES15. Cash limits on the nationalised industries&apos; requirements forexternal finance have also been published.    It should be possible for theindustries to observe these limits, provided that they are not preventedfrom doing so by the activities of the Price Commission.    I propose thatwe should tell the industries that we expect them to observe the publishedlimits, and will support them in doing so.CONCLUSION16. I invite my colleagues to agree that:-i.       We should not adjust the published cash limits to coverhigher price increases;3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALii0       we should be prepared to adjust the cash limits on theP.SG to cover the Governments share of local authoritysettlements, noting that I am bringing forward in the context ofthe Budget a proposal for economies in local authority currentexpenditure and for cutting back the proposed increase in theRSGs accordingly;iii. wen should adjust the cash limit on universities and theNational Health Service on the basis notified to them by theprevious Government;iv. the cash limits on fringe bodies should be treated in thesame way as those on Civil Service manpower, on which theLord President is circulating proposals.v.      we should tell the nationalised industries that we expectthem to observe the published cash limits on their externalfinancing requirements, and will support them in taking thenecessary action including price increases.If this is agreed, this policy would be incorporated in the Chancellor&apos;sBudget plans and announced in that context.     This need not precludeearlier action in Departments or with local authorities when this isoperationally necessary to achieve the required savings.    It is likelythat such action would have to be made public, but that is not in itselfa serious objection.wjbTreasury Chambers15 May 19794CONFIDENTIAL
