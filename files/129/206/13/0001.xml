CONFIDENTIAL[oCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT76C(79)1329 May 1979COPY NOCABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS 1979-80Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. At our meeting on 17 May (CC(79) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 4) I wasasked to propose targets for reductions in Departmental programmes for1979-80 and to report back to Cabinet, following discussions with the Ministersconcerned.    I attach the allocation which I circulated.2. I can report that, subject to the unresolved issues mentioned below,the Ministers concerned have agreed to meet the targets proposed. Igratefully acknowledge the positive responses I have received from colleagues,notwithstanding the difficulties to which they have drawn attention.3. Ministers&apos; responses have confirmed that the savings will be achievedby measures broadly on the lines proposed in the attachment to my letter of21 May, but I should bring the following points to the Cabinet&apos;s attention:-i. The Secretary of State for Social Services proposed increasingprescription and dental charges to raise  51 million this year,including Scotland.    To mitigate the overall effect of the Budget onprices, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I now recommend againstproceeding with this.    I proposed that the target of the Secretary ofState for Social Services should be reduced accordingly to  40 million,which he proposes to achieve by legislation in the Social Security Billto increase waiting days for sickness and unemployment benefit. Acorresponding adjustment should be made in the Secretary of State forScotland&apos;s target.ii. For similar reasons, we recommend against raising the proposedincrease in the school meals charge from 5p to lOp, by which theSecretary of State for Education and Science proposed to raise 22 million this year.    In this instance, it should be practicable tofind this amount from the education, science and arts budget in otherways;  and I recommend that we should do so.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALiii. A substantial portion ( 140 million) of the Secretary of State forIndustry1 s savings consists in a four months&apos; moratorium in paymentof regional development grant.    I propose that we accept this, but itwill impose an additional cost subsequently when it is reversed and willincrease the savings we will need in the industry programme in lateryears.iv. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary has proposed savingsof  40 million rather than the  50 million I suggested.    I believe thatit should be practicable to find the remaining  10 million from the aidprogramme and proposed that we ask him to make a further effort toachieve this.v. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is concerned thatthere may be insufficient funds in the Northern Ireland programme thisyear.    He has agreed to meet his proposed share of these reductions,but expects to have to submit a claim on the Contingency Reserve duringthe year to finance the continuation of Northern Ireland&apos;s Meat IndustryEmployment Scheme.THE OUTCOME OF THE EXERCISE4.        The savings identified by the Secretaries of State for Industry and forEmployment exceeded their targets by  22 million in total;  and theCo-operative Bank have agreed to refinance  25 million of outstanding exportcredit.    These additional amounts come close to offsetting the loss of savingsfrom health charges.     Providing that the Secretary of State for Education andScience can make up in other ways the loss of revenue from the school mealscharge, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary can find another 10 million from the aid programme, the reductions will reach the overalltarget of  1, 365 million this year proposed in my letter of 21 May.DEFENCE5. We agreed on 17 May that there was a case for increased expenditure ondefence, and a figure of  100 million was proposed.    I recommend acceptingthis addition to the defence programme this year:  the Secretary of State forDefence proposes to reinforce it by a vigorous economy campaign.DISPOSAL OF ASSETS6. I was also asked by Cabinet on 17 May to review the scope for sellingpublic sector assets with the aim of realising at least  1, 000 million in1979-80.    After consulting colleagues, the Financial Secretary, Treasury, andI conclude that without special legislation it should be possible to realise 1.200 million.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHalf would come from selling British Petroleum shares and500 million from the oil assets of the British National Oi1 Corporation andBritish Gas, of which British Gas1 share should amount to at least 200 million.    The remaining  100 million wouxd come from NationalEnterprise Board shareholdings.    There are a number of minor possibilitieswhich it may be possible to add to this total.We are also examining the scope for selling off land and buildings ownedby Government agencies;  but this will take time, and may not realise anysignificant savings in this financial year.CONCLUSIONS9.       I invite the Cabinet:-i. To note that, provided other savings can be found to replace thehigher increase in school meals charge and a further  10 million can befound from the aid programme, the overall target of  1, 365 million(1979 Survey prices) proposed in my letter of 21 May has been achieved.ii. To agree to increase the defence budget this year by 100 million.iii. To note that it should be possible to realise  1, 200 million thisyear from the sales of public sector assets proposed in paragraph 7.WJBTreasury Chambers29 May 19793CONFIDENTIAL

We agreed at Cabinetat the aim should be  to find extra savings of  5OO-6OO millionIthat I should formulate targets for reduction by each Department.Itach an allocation.    As pointed out in the Cabinet discussionlannot tackle this by blanket percentage reductions:     the needBo ensure that  every Minister makes the maximum savings possiblein his own programme.     I have  therefore  started from theosals in my Memorandum and in scaling them up I have takenBiunt of our priorities  and of what is likely to be practicablerathe remainder of  1979-80.     I  indicate  in the  attachment somepeas for reductions which I have had in mind but it will of coursep acceptable if the Ministers concerned prefer to make equivalentor larger savings  in other ways.I hope that,  in the light of Thursday&apos;s Cabinet decisions,  you andBother colleagues will accept these reductions and,   in consulta-B&quot; as necessary with the Secretaries of State for Scotland andfeles on the programmes covering Great Britain as a whole,  let meKf in broad terms how you propose to implement them in yourpspectiveTheareas of responsibility.^measures proposed should be additional to those resultingshe r,0^ a^reea* cash limits policy this year and,   in the case ofnationalised industries and other bodies, to the proceeds ofotil   W are heing discussed separately with the Ministerseducti--&quot;- .Sil7lilarlyi   the measures should be additional to the,1^ns *n local authority current expenditure which we are seekingIs     hy reducing the cash limit on the Rate Support Grant.1
CONFJDKNTJAI,cI  should be grateful to hear from you and the other collea uCsconcerned by 2k May so that. I can report back to Cabinet in t],efollowing week.There  are  two  further points  to which  I  draw your attention. Irecognise the  limitations on cutting expenditure  in 1979-80but  such reductions  are  to be  preferred  to  capital expenditureand,   in general,   to  increases  in charges.     Second,  we  must avoidchoosing reductions  in  1979-80 of a kind which will  inci-ca.se ourproblems  in reducing expenditure  in I.98O-8I or later years. Theimportance  of achieving  sufficient  reductions  in the  figures vphave  inherited for those years will be  quite as great as for thecurrent year.If you or any other colleagues would  like  to  discuss  the means bywhich the reductions  should be  achieved,   I would gladly arrangethat.I am copying this letter to the Prime Minister, to other membersof the Cabinet,   to the Minister of Transport and to Sir John HuntJOHN BIFFENPS. I will be replying separately to your letter to Geoffrey Ho*&apos;eof 18 May.
