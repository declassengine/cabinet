CONFIDENTIAL[jMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79)1529 May 1979COPY NO 76CABINETREFUGEES FROM VIETNAMMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome Department1. This memorandum considers the serious problem caused by the flowof boat refugees from Vietnam.NUMBERS AND COMMITMENTS2. Many South East Asian states will not allow refugees to land on theirterritories without guarantees of ultimate responsibility from the flagcountries of rescuing vessels.    Masters of United Kingdom registered shipsare bound by international and domestic law to render assistance to thosefound in distress on the high seas.    In recognition of this obligation theprevious Administration agreed that an undertaking should be given, whererefugees were rescued by United Kingdom registered vessels, that any notaccepted by other countries of resettlement within an agreed period wouldbe accepted by the United Kingdom.    Such guarantees are now a commonpractice among maritime states.3. In addition, the previous Administration agreed in January, at therequest of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),to admit a further 1, 500 Vietnamese refugees.    1, 000 were to come fromHong Kong and 250 each from Malaysia and Thailand.    The quotas forMalaysia and Thailand have been filled, but only 400 of the Hong Kong quotahave so far been selected.    A total of 270 have so far arrived.4. Since the spring of 1975 the United Kingdom has accepted forresettlement a total of 1,923 Indo-Chinese refugees (see Annex A). TheUnited States has accepted more than 250, 000,  France about 60, 000,Canada 11, 000 and Australia 18, 000.    Of our European Economic Community(EEC) partners other than France, Germany has taken about twice as manyas us, and Belgium about the same as us.M. V. SIBONGA AND M. V. ROACH BANKThe immediate problems are the refugees on the M. V. Sibonga andthe M. V. Roach Bank.    The M. V. Sibonga, a United Kingdom registeredvessel, has arrived at Hong Kong with 900 Vietnamese boat refugees onoard.    There are now 34, 000 Vietnamese refugees in the Colony, and the1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHong Kong Government regards the situation as desperate.    The Colonyalso has a massive flow of immigrants from China.    They have asked usto take the 900.6. It was announced last evening that the Prime Minister in consultationwith the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and myself, had decided thatwe should accept responsibility for the Sibonga refugees.    A copy of thestatement is at Annex C.7. The M. V. Roach Bank, another United Kingdom registered vessel,has arrived at Taiwan with 293 boat refugees on board.    On a previousoccasion involving a different vessel the Taiwanese refused to accept ourguarantee and insisted that 346 boat refugees be airlifted direct to theUnited Kingdom.  They appear to be taking the same line new.FUTURE POLICY8. There are serious political implications in the acceptance of alarge-scale commitment towards Indo-Chinese refugees.    Such a commit-ment would be seen as leading to an influx of immigrants which we couldnot control.    There is also the risk that a willingness on our part to acceptrefugees could be exploited by racketeers.    But it is difficult to reduce theextent of the commitment.    I do not think we can go back on our predecessorsdecision on the 1, 500 quota (paragraph 3).    If we try to reverse the policy ofgiving guarantees to countries in South East Asia that we will in the lastresort accept those rescued by United Kingdom registered ships it will betaken as being intended to discourage captains of British ships from rescuingthose in danger of drowning.    But we should so far as possible - and thiswill be difficult - monitor each case carefully to prevent corruption; weshould not respond positively to any new approach by the UNHCR without themost careful consideration;  and the criteria for the admission of other Indo-Chinese refugees on the grounds of United Kingdom ties or connectionsshould be very stringent - indeed we shall have to consider what scope thereis for tightening these criteria up.9. I recognise the difficulties faced by the Hong Kong Government. ButI do not think thit we can agree automatically to accept refugees landedthere from United Kingdom registered ships.    We simply cannot tell whatnumbers this could involve.    Nor would such refugees necessarily be moresuitable for settlement in the United Kingdom than others in the camps. Onthe other hand, I recognise that a blank refusal to take any more from HongKong would be difficult to sustain.    We need to consider carefully whatadditional numbers we could accept, having regard particularly to those whowould present serious resettlement problems.    We should also considerways of offsetting the immigration commitment, for example, by changingfoe special quota of work permits for the dependent territories.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS10, If further groups of refugees are to be accepted, there would have tobe some once-for-all expenditure on making ready the necessary accommoda-tion, and the Government would have to meet the consequential expenses ofthe voluntary organisations.    The former cannot be quantified at this stage.The best estimate available at present of the cost to the voluntary organisa-tions of coping with the refugees from the Sibonga and the Roach Bank isatout  0.4 -  0 6 million in the first year.    This would be in addition tosocial security payments.    Other Departments might also incur additionalexpenditure.    The Home Ofiice (and perhaps the other Departmentsconcerned) is unable to meet all these additional costs from its existingpublic expenditure provision.    In my view expenditure of this natureconstitutes a legitimate claim on the Contingency Reserve.    Moreover, ifrefugees over and above these are to be accepted, the Government wouldhave to consider becoming even more directly involved in the reception andresettlement process (see Annex B),CONCLUSIONS11. We have to recognise that the problems of the &quot;Vietnamese refugeesraise the widest issues of foreign policy and that they will need to be dealtwith by international action for which I know the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary will press.    So far as this country is concerned, however, Iinvite my colleagues to take note of the decision which has been taken inrespect of the Sibonga refugees;  and to agree:-a. that we should accept the 1, 500 quota agreed by the previousAdministration;b. that we should not agree now to accept automatically allrefugees landed in Hong Kong by United Kingdom registeredvessels, but should give further consideration to the possibleextent to which we can help by taking a limited number who wouldnot present serious resettlement problems;c. thfvt in other cases we should continue to give the undertakingto accept refugees rescued by United Kingdom registered shipswho are not resettled elsewhere;d. that we should monitor the situation carefully and take whataction we can to prevent racketeering;e. that we should seek ways of offsetting the immigrationcommitments; andf. that any extra cost falling on the Home Office (and, subjectto the views of my colleagues concerned, on other Departments)as the result of additional numbers of Vietnamese should be metout of the Contingency Reserve.W.

These were mostly Embassy staffs and&apos;students.(b) United Kingdom ties or connectionsShortly after the fall of Saigon in May 1975, theprevious Administration announced that it would beprepared to admit as refugees from Vietnam (laterextended to include Laos and Cambodia) those who hadsome tie or connection with the United Kingdom.These tend to be mostly family reunion cases. Numberswill increase in proportion to the size of the Indo-Chinese community in this country.(c) Boat refugeesSee paragraph 2 of the paper.(d) The 1500 quotaSee paragraph 3 of the paper.2.

Cui-IALANNEX BARRANGEMENTS FOR RECEPTION AND RESETTLEMENT OF VIETNAMESErqaTPEOPLE:    PRACTICAL CONSTRAINTS1. The Government relies on the voluntary refugee organisationsto handle the reception and resettlement of all refugees. Thetwo major organisations are the British Council for Aid toRefugees (BCAR), who co-ordinate the work of the other bodies,and the Ockenden Venture.     The rate of reception is effectively,dependent on the capacity of these organisations.2, The increase in the numbers of refugees in the last year orso has necessitate financial assistance from the Government toleet the additional costs,BCAR&apos;s estimate of the cost(exclusive of social security payments) of receiving and resettl-ing refugees is approximately  350 per head per year.      In thelast financial year, a total of  343,000 was paid by the HomeOffice to the voluntary refugee organisations.     So far in thisfinancial year, out of the  1M estimated for the purpose,  30,000has been paid in respect of the Vietnamese,  34,000 in respect ofrefugees from Latin America and  14,000 for BCAR&apos;s administrativecost.     During the year, the greater part of the likely expendi-ture will be in respect of refugees from South East Asia (of whom&apos;about 1300 are still to come from the quota of 1500 agreed by thelast Government).     This estimate, however, does not make allowancefor groups (like those from the Sibonga and Roach Bank) picked upby British ships and for whom we might have to accept responsibilityThere -are currently some 550 refugees from South East Asi in thecare of the voluntary organisations.3. The voluntary organisations could not handle substantial extranumbers of Vietnamese refugees without more Government money andother forms oi practical help - for example, in finding accommo-tetion and specialist staff - which could make demands onDepartments other than the Home Office.     They would also have totake on extra temporary administrative and case-working staff.4. BCAR&apos;s initial reaction to the group from the m.v. Sibongais that, given sufficient notice - say.about three months -arrangements could be made between Ockenden and themselves toreceive them.     A great deal would depend on the rate of arrival.If all, or the bulk, of the 984 were to arrive over a very shortPeriod (e.g. on to three months) they would almost certainly haveto be received into camps.     The Government would have to helpBCAR (through the PSA) to find a camp, and possibly Ockenden asWeH (although the latter may be able to obtain suitable premises0n their own).     Camps of this size would need extra staff -Perhaps 30 to 40 per camp.     Some of these extra staff could befound locally, but the professionals, administrative assistants,interpreters and case-workers) would have to be advertised for.BCAR think that the necessary staff could be obtained in time.If the arrivals could be spread over a year, this might^viate the need for more than one camp, but it would still bePessary to obtain more accommodation than is available atPresent.     If the 293 refugees picked up by the m.v. Roach Banka^e to be accepted almost at once (Taiwan, the first port ofall, refused even temporary accommodation to the 360 &quot;Well Park&quot;e ugees), special emergency arrangements, including a camp, wille needed and contingency plans are already in hand.fCONFIDENTIAL
2&apos;    [. cohf^wiiaI 15   The voluntary refugee organisations &quot;should be able to cope/itta the refugees from the Sibonga and the Roach Bank. Thereare doubts, however, about their capacity to cope with anyfurther substantial influxes of boat people beyond that. Thiswould almost certainly mean the opening of fresh camps.    It isopen to question whether either of the two main organisationshave sufficient management ability to control what would thenhave become a very complex, country-wide organisation with arelatively large budget.      If the United Kingdom is forced toadmit further substantial numbers over and above those from thein.v. Sibonga and m.v. Roach Bank, it seems inevitable that theGovernment would have to &quot;consider taking over some direct respon-sibility for their reception and resettlement.     As it is, avery close eye would have to be kept on how the voluntary bodiescopies with the Sibonga and&apos; Roach Bank groups.7.   The availability of local authority services represents afurther constraint.      This is particularly true of housing.    So far,refugee arrivals have been phased so as to allow the voluntaryrefugee organisations to resettle them in various parts of thecountry after a relatively short time (three to six months) in areception centre.     They have been able to do this because thenumbers have been matched by sufficient offers of housing fromlocal authorities.      It would not be as easy to accommodate afurther, say, 1,000 refugees arriving over a short period; theywould have to spend a longer time in the reception centres.Another possible constraint would be the capacity of localeducation authorities to cope with the necessary language trainingon this scale.     Outside London (where the &quot;Well Park&quot; refugeeswere received initially) this capacity has not so far been tested.
ANNEX CPRESSJOTICEThe Prime Minister, in consultation with the Home Secretarynd the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, has decided onumanitarian grounds that this country will accept&apos;esponsibility for the refugees from Vietnam on board MV Sibonga,ho were rescued on the high seas.They have been in touch with the Governor of Hong Kong.In taking this decision the British Government stresses thatt cannot make any general commitment about similar action inuture.   Consultation will be pursued urgently with theovernment of Hong Kong and the international community about thehole problem of refugees from Indo-China. &apos;
