SECRETSDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT80C(79) 266 July 1979COPY NOCABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE, 1980-81 TO 1983-84Memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. We took and announced in the Budget our public expenditure decisionsfor the current year 1979-80. We must now come to grips with decisions onthe public expenditure plans for 1980-81 and subsequent years.2. Our general approach is clear: we are going to make largereductions in the public expenditure plans which we inherited.    This isessential to our strategy generally, and especially to our key aim ofreducing direct taxation and overcoming inflation.3. Factual material is in the two survey reports by officials, &quot;TheInherited Plans&quot; and &quot;The Scope for Reductions&quot;: the former is availableto colleagues in their Departments, the latter is circulated separately asC(79) 25.    Also relevant are the reviews which we shall shortly beconsidering: the review of nationalised industries&apos; investment andfinancing, the Lord President&apos;s report on further action to reduce the sizeof the Civil Service, and the review of disposals of assets.DECISIONS TO BE TAKEN4. I propose that initially we concentrate on 1980-81.    This paper isconcerned only with that year.5. The full Survey covers public expenditure plans for all years up to1983-84.    We must certainly address ourselves to the problems of these lateryears, and I will bring forward proposals to that end after the holidays; butit is more urgent to come to decisions now about 1980-81.    This we shouldaim to do before the summer holidays, not only to facilitate orderlypreparations for the Rate Support Grant negotiation in November, and for theParliamentary Estimates and fixing of cash limits, but because successfulimplementation of cuts on the scale at which we must aim will be aided byearly notice to those concerned, especially local authorities.1SECRET
SECRET6. The decisions we take now about plans for 1980-81 -will be subject tosuch modification as may later be required by the operation oi cash limits.Our cash limits policy we shall be discussing separately.    If our financialobjectives, and the development of pay and prices, do not allow as muchcash for public expenditure programmes as the planning decisions now underdiscussion would imply, the plans will have to be modified accordingly.PUBLICATION7. The established procedure is that the results of the annual Surveyare published about the turn of the year in a public expenditure White Papercovering all the years of the Survey.    I propose however that we postponefor the moment decisions on the timing and form of the White Paper. Letus settle the substance first.8. However, if the relevant decisions about 1980-81 are to becommunicated to local authorities and others, it will be for considerationwhether a statement of all the main changes proposed for 1980-81 should bemade public quite soon, in advance of the White Paper, so that proposalsbecoming public concerning individual programmes can be seen in thecontext of a general policy for next year.OBJECTIVE FOR 1980-819. In 1980-81 we must at least maintain the trend we have set in 1979-80and stay on course for bringing expenditure back to the 1977-78 level by1982-83.    In the current year the decisions we have taken should ensure thatpublic expenditure outturn is no higher than in 1978-79.    We must achievesome reduction in that level in 1980-81.10. Table 1 of the report &quot;The Scope for Reductions&quot; shows that, if nocuts were made, expenditure in 1980-81 would total around S.74j billion, 5 billion more than the expected outturn in 1979-80.11. The Chancellor of the Exchequer1 s paper indicates that, in order toavoid the prospect of increases in the burden of taxation in the next Budget,we must aim at reductions of not less than  6j billion in the Cmnd 7439 plansfor 1980-81.PROPOSALS FOR ACTION12. Taking account both of the evident difficulties of some of the optionsand of such additional bids as look unavoidable, I propose that eachDepartment should be asked to make for 1980-81 the net changes from theplans in Cmnd 7439 listed in Annex A.2SECRET
SECRET13. These reductions would amount to about  4f billion.    In addition,I propose to cut the Contingency Reserve, which stands at  1540 million,by some  f billion.    Options being put forward in the nationalisedindustries&apos; financing and investment review and savings from the LordPresident1 s review of the Civil Service (beyond the savings included in thismemorandum) might be assumed to produce some i\ billion.    So theseproposals would give total reductions of the order of  6 billion, leavingS.\ billion to be made up by further sales of assets.14. It is for each Minister to decide how he makes up his total of cuts,but I list for illustration in Annex B the options and additional bids which Ihave had in mind in arriving at the figures I suggest.    The brief referencesin Annex B to specific measures are elaborated in the main paper on options(C(79) 25).    B--sca&quot;se of the difficulties of some of the options presented inthat paper, particularly on social security and contributions to the EuropeanEconomic Community (EEC) Budget, I have had to replace them by a furthergeneral cut of 3 per cent on the majority of programmes.DEFENCE15. The volume of defence spending in 1979-80 will be reduced by theValue Added Tax (VAT) and other price increases.    Measured against thatbase, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) target of 3 per centgrowth can be met in 1980-81, whilst still permitting us to make reductionof  300 million in the previously published plans.LAW AND ORDER16. Some increases are necessary in the police, prison and probationservices, but we must keep these to a minimum, and find all possibleoffsetting savings.EEC BUDGET17. Our contribution to the EEC Budget is expected to rise in 1980-81to  1.1 billion, over  600 million higher than in 1977-78.    This underlinesthe importance of negotiating a reduction in our contribution.    In 1980-81,our contribution looks like being some  240 million higher than so farprovided for, and since any reduction we negotiate in our contribution tothe 1980 Budget would not significantly affect expenditure until 1981-82 thereappears to be no way of avoiding this.HEALTH18. Consistently with the Manifesto commitment not to reduce spendingon the National Health Service, we should keep gross spending at its presentplanned level but reduce net spending - the charge against public expenditureby increased charges and possibly other sources of revenue.    We cannot3SECRET
SECRETafford at present to devote any part of this additional income to increasingthe rate of gross spending above that planned by our predecessors. Inspending on personal social services, which is not covered by the Manifestocommitment, some gross cuts may be possible.HOUSING19. We need the large cuts here on which we agreed in Opposition.Annex B proposes reductions accordingly.    I suggest that we must takethe necessary steps to ensure that rents rise faster than earnings in 1980-81,hold the level of new housebuilding approvals to the 50, 000 likely to beachieved this year, and postpone inessential increases in spending oncouncil house improvements and local authority mortgage lending.LOCAL AUTHORITIES20. The reductions required in local authority programmes in 1980-81imply a cut in the inherited plans of ^a per cent on current expenditure and33j per cent on capital (England and Wales).    They will be difficult to secure,particularly on current expenditure, where the Government has no directcontrol.    The Consultative Council will discuss expenditure reductions in1980-81 on 9 July and their views can be reported to Cabinet.    We shall needto inform the local authorities as soon as possible of our decisions on 1980-8J.,to give them time to revise their plans.21. I have suggested we should not reach decisions yet concerning thelater years.    However, the strategy for 1979-80 and 1980-81 plainly impliesrising reductions after 1980-81.    My colleagues responsible for localauthority expenditure will wish to consider whether to consult further withthe local authorities about the later years, though this should not hold up thedecisions about 1980-81.SOCIAL SECURITY22. Social security represents a quarter of public expenditure and,notwithstanding our move to prices-only upratings, is still growing becauseof demographic changes and the New Pensions Scheme.    The full amountsincluded in the options would require real reductions in the level of pensionsand other benefits and possibly, under some scenarios, money reductions too.This would be very difficult.    I suggest we should determine now to make themuch more modest (though still not easy) level of savings included inAnnex A.    We should then in the autumn examine the possibilities of largersavings in later years, though the obstacles in the way of finding these areonly too apparent.    On the other hand, I suggest also that we defer until nextApril a decision on a November 1980 uprating of child benefit, which is one ofthe biggest single bids; I have however taken account of the possibility thatwe may decide on this in considering the size of the Contingency Reserve.4SECRET
SECRETIMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAMMES23. Cabinet will recognise that for most programmes, and in particularhousing, education, social security, aid and transport, the effect of the cutsproposed will be a substantial reduction in the planned level of services.In a number of areas there will be political problems in defending thenecessary cuts.    But I do not see any easier options nor do I believe that adifferent distribution could significantly lessen the criticisms.    We needall these cuts if we are to maintain progress towards our fiscal and monetaryobjectives.LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS24. Some of the options would require additional legislation in the currentSession.    I have drawn attention to these in Annex B.    I recognise thedifficulty of this but I suggest that we press forward with the necessarymeasures, to ensure that the intended savings do not slip into a later year.END-YEAR FLEXIBILITY25. The Ministry of Defence and other spending Departments havesuggested arrangements for carrying forward limited amounts of unspentallocations from one year to the next.    There are managerial advantagesin such an arrangement, but in present circumstances I think that it wouldhave to be subject to three conditions.    First, provision for expenditurelikely to be carried forward must not add to the public expenditure planningtotal.    Second, it should be limited to expenditure where there is a strongmanagerial case for carry-over, principally capital expenditure. Third,the scheme should not imply relaxation in the strict observance of cashlimits.26. If Cabinet agree that such a scheme should be explored subject to thethree conditions above, I will bring forward proposals which, I suggest,might be discussed in a smaller group of Ministers.CONCLUSION27. I propose that we:-i. agree to the aim of achieving a net reduction in the planningtotal for 1980-81 of not less than S.6j billion.ii. Agree that, accordingly, there should be net reductions andadditions to Departments&apos; shares of programmes in 1980-81 as shownin Annex A, and that I should discuss with the Ministers concernedany difficulties they see in achieving these figures.5SECRET
SECRETiii. Agree that I should come back to Cabinet in the autumn withproposals for the years 1981-82 to 1983-84.iv. Agree that we should explore a scheme which would allowlimited carry-over of unspent allocations from year to year, subjectto the three conditions in paragraph 25 above.wjbTreasury Chambers6 July 19796SECRET
