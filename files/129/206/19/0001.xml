CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79)1911 June 1979COPY NO76CABINETTHE BINGHAM REPORT:  A FURTHER INQUIRYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affairs1. The Bingham Report on the operations of British Petroleum (BP) andShell in Southern Africa during the period 1965-78 indicated that one Britishregistered BP/Shell subsidiary, that in Lourenco Marques, in addition to thecompanies&apos; South African subsidiaries, was from time to time involved in thehandling of oil on its way to Rhodesia;  that the Head Offices of both companiesknew about this and made swap arrangements, which were only temporarilyeffective, to take the British registered company out of the line of supply; andthat the British Government of 1966-70 were aware of these swap arrangementsbut did not know that they had subsequently lapsed and that there was then afurther period in which the British registered company was involved in directsupply to Rhodesia.2. The Report was submitted to the Government last August; waspublished in September;  was referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions(DPP) for further inquiries at to whether evidence existed to support criminalprosecutions;  and was debated in both Houses in November.    Following thedebate, the then Government announced its intention to institute a furtherinquiry by a Joint Committee of both Houses presided over by a Lord of Appeal.The Motion to set up such an inquiry was passed by the Commons andrejected by the Lords.3. The Government made no further statement of its intentions before theElection,    But tfee Hou&amp;e of CommoiWywas informed on 20 A^jaltnat theShadow Cabinet had decided not to support a further review.    I believe weshould now confirm that decision.4-        I do not consider there is anything useful to be gained by a furtherParliamentary inquiry and a good deal to be lost.    The main facts are fullyset out and documented in the Bingham Report and this has been published.A further inquiry would merely rake over the embers and provide an occasionfor accusation and counter-accusation which would neither reflect credit on thepolitical system nor do us any good abroacL    We would face difficult questionsCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALover the provision of Cabinet records to the inquiry and would come underpressure to make concessions which could be a damaging precedent on otheroccasions.5. Nor do I think a decision not to set up a further inquiry will do us muchdamage abroad.    African Commonwealth Governments have been indignantabout the allegations of sanctions-breaking in the Report.    But their attentionhas throughout been focused on the subsequent legal action against thecompanies (President Kaunda of Zambia has again taken up the cudgels againstthem) rather than on a further Parliamentary inquiry which they have tended toregard as a primarily domestic affair.    No doubt some will, however,criticise a decision by us not to have a further inquiry.6. I suggest therefore that we make an early Parliamentary statement inboth Houses saying we will not institute a further inquiry.7. I have not tried to cover in this paper the outcome of the referral to theDPP of the Bingham Report.    That is of course a matter for the DPP, subjectto the direction of the Attorney General;  and I understand that the DPP islikely soon to report to the Attorney General on whether there is sufficientprospect of evidence to support criminal prosecutions.    No doubt theAttorney General will keep us informed so that there will be an adequateopportunity to bring to his attention considerations of public interest whichmight properly be taken into account by him in reaching a decision.CForeign and Commonwealth Office11 June 19792CONFIDENTIAL
