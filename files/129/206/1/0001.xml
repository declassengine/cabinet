I attach a draft for The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliamentin the form in which it has been agreed by The Queen1 s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee (QL).2. The draft takes our Manifesto as its starting point and assumes asession running until July or1 October 1980;    It concentrates Oh the mainitems in the programme on which we can expect to make progress in asession of that length, but with due regard to the constraints on publicexpenditure.    It also refers to some important items of legislation, hotmentioned in the Manifesto, which QL considered should be introducedduring the first session;  and to certain other major policy issues, forexample in the fields of defence and foreign relations, on which we shallbe expected to state our position.3. I am grateful to those of our colleagues who have contributed to thedraft, including departmental Ministers who are not members of QL, Wehave adopted their suggestions so far as we felt able to do soj  where wehave not, it has usually been because they implied commitments to publicexpenditure which we did not consider we could justify at this stage, or ongrounds of length.    Where appropriate, points not included in the Speechcan of course be made during the Debate on the Address.4. There are three matters which I should draw to the attention of mycolleagues as needing confirmation of our policy.    They are:-a. Overseas aid (page 2, linos 16.-17), on which wo should establishwhether our policy is to take a new direction which should bereflected in the Speech.b. &apos; The future of tke Price Commiseion (page 3, lines 10-12) in thelight of the Secretary of State for Trade&apos;s minute to the PrimeMinister of 7 May; and1
