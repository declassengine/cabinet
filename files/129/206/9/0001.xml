CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79)9 rjnCOPY NO    f 021 May 1979CABINETUPRATING OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Services1, The social security uprating must take place no later than12 November.    Decisions are now required on our policy for determiningthe new rates so that an announcement can be made in the Budget Statement.I have discussed the main uprating issues with the Chancellor and theChief Secretary, Treasury, who are broadly in agreement with my proposals.THE MAIN RATES2, Existing legislation requires us to increase pensions and other long-term benefits in line with the forecast increase between last November andnext November in earnings or prices, whichever is the higher. Sickness,unemployment and other short-term benefits must be increased by theforecast movement of prices over the same period.    Firm forecasts are notyet available.    The price forecast in particular may be affected by Budgetmeasures.3. I propose that in future we should limit our statutory commitment touprating long-term benefits in line with prices.    If this is agreed, we shouldannounce the change soon, preferably during the Budget debate.    The changewill be severely criticised, but we can point out that it will be open to theGovernment to give a larger increase than the price movement if economiccircumstances permit.    Indeed, at this uprating if the earnings forecastexceeds the price forecast by only a small amount, I propose to use thehigher forecast.4. If the earnings forecast turns out to be substantially higher than priceswe shall need urgent amending legislation to give statutory authority to therates we shall be announcing and in that event I would propose to use theChristmas Bonus Bill.    If we are not under that compulsion, then sincethe change will be very controversial and we need to get the Christmas BonusBill through as quickly as possible, it would be possible to include thenereosary legislation in a later Social Security Bill planned for the Autumn.-The Chancellor, however, feels that it might be as well to legislateimmediately in any event.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSHORTFALL5b        There is, however, a decision to be made.    The forecasts used forthe last uprating were 1.9 per cent (earnings) and one per cent (prices) shortof the actual movements in earnings and prices.    The present single personrate of  19.50 for long-term benefits and  15,75 for short-term benefitsshould have been  19.85 and  15.90.    While there is no statutory obligationto take account of this shortfall,   the previous Administration announcedthat it would do so.    I propose that we follow suit.    This both keeps ourpromise to honour the pension commitments of the previous Administrationand will make our new uprating policy of price protection a little moreacceptable.CHRISTMAS BONUS6. We promised to continue the Christmas bonus and I propose that weshould announce, as part of the uprating statement, a  10 bonus to be paidin the first week of December to the same categories as last year. Theremay be some disappointment that the rate remains the same, but I do notfeel justified in making any greater demand this year. Legislation will beneeded to pay the bonus. A question for consideration is whether this shouldinclude a commitment to paying a bonus annually in future.    Our promiseto &quot;continue&quot; the bonus has undoubtedly given rise to an expectation that weshall do so, and this would be my preference.    The Chancellor would preferour commitment to this to be limited to one year only,CHILD BENEFIT7. Child benefit was increased by  1 to  4 last April as the final stage tophasing out child tax allowances,    I would have liked to have been able toincrease this to  4.25 in November in order to maintain its value - we shallhave a rough ride in view of the last Governments promise of  4, 50.Nevertheless, I accept that this must give way to the overriding necessity ofrestricting public expenditure.    However, I propose that the premium paidto one-parent families, not increased for a year, should be increased from 2 to  2. 50.    This will bring some extra help to a needy group.MOBILITY ALLOWANCE8. Mobility allowance was last increased to  10 in July 1978.    A rate ofaround  11, 50 would be required by November to maintain its value and Iconsider that it would be in accordance with our general approach to theproblems of disabled people to pay a little extra, ie a rate of  12.DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS9*       A large number of those on low incomes are pensioners and 64 percent of the expenditure on the Christmas bonus would go to households in thebottom 40 per cent of the income distribution (adjusted for household sizeand composition).    Some 77 per cent of the expenditure on uprating the one-parent family premium would go to households in the bottom 60 per cent offre income distribution.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCOSTS10,      The costs of these proposals may be summarised as follows:-United Kingdom 1979 Survey Prices	Benefit	1979-80		Admini stration	 m	 mTaking account of shortfall	80-90*	NILChristmas bonus	104. 5	3.5One-parent family premium	3	0.2Mobility allowance	2	NILDelay in announcement of	NIL	0.9general uprating		Manpower(included inadmin, costfigure)man yearsNIL10025NIL45and in 1980-81 and subsequent years there will be a benefit cost of 200- 220 million* for making good the shortfall,  7. 6 million fcr thepremium, and  6 million for mobility allowance.    These figures total forbenefit  189. 5 million in 1979-80 and  213. 6 million (or  318. 1 million ifthe bonus is to be continued) in subsequent years, and for administration 4.6 million in 1979-80.    There is no provision in the public expenditureprogrammes, nor is there provision for the administrative cost in the1979-80 cash limits and provision for the additional manpower is requiredoutside the 3 per cent cut agreed at Cabinet on 17 May.    The total benefitand administration cost will have to be borne by the Contingency Reserve.(*The cost would depend on whether or not the shortfall to be taken intoaccount (35p on the single pension) were calculated in terms of 1978 moneyvalues without adjustment for loss of value since then.)CONCLUSION11.      I invite my colleagues to agree that:-i.    we change the uprating commitment for long-term benefits toprice movements only and legislate immediately if necessary;ii.    last year&apos;s shortfall should be taken into account (paragraph 5);iii. a Christmas bonus of  10 should be paid this year (paragraph 6);iv. the one-parentt family premium should be increased to  2. 50in November (paragraph 7);v.     mobility allowance should be increased to  12 in November(paragraph 8);3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALvi.    provision is made for the total additional costs, includingadministration costs, to be borne by the Contingency Reserve.I also invite my colleagues to consider:-.vii.    whether, even if legislation is not immediately necessary onthe changed uprating policy, we should in fact legislate at theearliest opportunity or whether the matter is better left; andviii.    whether we should commit ourselves now to annual bonusesin future on the basis of permanent legislation.P JDepartment of Health and Social Security21 May 19794CONFIDENTIAL
