CONFIDENTIALvlENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 4 COPY NO 7 g14 May 1979CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  SCOPE FOR CUTSMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryINTRODUCTION1. One of our most urgent tasks is to decide on immediate reductionsin the spending plans we have inherited for the current financial year1979-80.    This is important to give the Chancellor maximum scope in hisBudget for reducing the burden of direct taxation and meeting an appropriatemonetary target.    It is not possible at this stage to say precisely how muchwe should aim to take off the current spending plans for this year. Clearly,the more we can agree to reduce public spending, the larger the step we cantake in this Budget towards our fiscal and monetary objectives.    We mustnot prejudice this aim by adding too rapidly to those programmes, eg. defenceand law and order, where we are committed to improvements.2. This paper accordingly concentrates on the current financial year.After the Budget we shall want to review spending plans over the next fouryears.    This can be done best in the context of the new public expendituresurvey, and I shall be putting proposals to Cabinet on how that survey shouldbe conducted.CASH LIMITS3.        The parallel paper on cash limits (C(79) 5) explains the currentposition, and makes proposals on the treatment of pay increases higherthan provided for in cash limits at present.    For the purposes of this paperwe need to bear two points in mind:a. Higher price increases than provided for in cash limits willsqueeze the volume of public expenditure in 1979-80.    The preciseamount depends on the effect of the Budget on prices, but a squeeze of4-5 per cent on this component of the cash limits should be sustainable.It is for Ministers in charge of Departments to determine how in detailto manage this in their several programmes.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. There will be a further volume squeeze on current expenditureto the extent that action is taken to offset pay settlements higher thanprovided for, on the lines proposed in my other papeia.CUTS: GENERAL4. But we need to go beyond the generalised volume squeeze throughcash limits.    Recognising that the scope for cuts in the current year islimited by the extant to which expenditure is already committed for this yearor where the cuts we intend imply major reviews of policy, often requiringlegislation, I invite my colleagues to consider the proposals listed in theAnnex.5. That list amounts to some  750 million (1979 Survey prices). Inselecting candidates for the list, I have tried to avoid so far as possible adisproportionate cut in capital spending (the large item for local authorityhousebuilding is an exception, but there has been heavy underspending in thepast so that much of this sum might otherwise go on council houseimprovements, mortgage lending, etc. ).    Several of the items proposeincreased charges, which will have an effect on the Retail Price Index (RPI).But in present conditions it seems to me right to raise charges where possiblso that the user (apart from exempt categories) pays a larger share of thecost of providing the service.6. The figures in the Annex are generally for England and Wales; forrelevant services proportionate cuts would be expected for Scotland &quot;(11 per cent) and Northern Ireland (3 per cent).    This would add some 60 million to the total above.LOCAL AUTHORITIES7. A large proportion (about 25 per cent) of total current spending isthe responsibility of local authorities.    This is not directly controlled bycentral Government, which provides 61 per cent of the cost of relevantexpenditure in England and Wales (68-1 Per cent in Scotland) through the ratesupport grant (RSG).    The financial position of individual authorities varies,but is generally strong.    They have substantial balances, and have increasedrates by 19 per cent on average (England and Wales) instead of the singlefigures predicted by the previous Administration.    They have thus insulatedthemselves from most of any likely squeeze resulting from higher pay andprices.    There is some danger that they will spend in volume terms morethan the plans in the last Public Expenditure White Paper and RSG settlement,by up to some  400 million in England and Wales and  50 million in Scotland.8. The extent to which the RSG cash limit should be adjusted in respectof pay settlements is discussed in my other paper.    Adjustments in respectof pay increases can be combined with a call for general economies inservices, and the adjustments to the RSG modified accordingly.    I proposethat the increase in the RSG cash limit which would otherwise2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhave taken place to support the pay settlements should be abated by anamount of at least  200 million (England and Wales) and  &quot;25 million(Scotland).    We could also make it clear that this cut is intended to make itmore likely that total local authority spending in the current year stayswithin present planned volume.    The cut should be backed by guidance toauthorities, pointing out (if Cabinet agrees) that central Governmentmanpower should be subject to a substantial squeeze, so that it is right forlocal authorities to seek parallel economies in manpower, bothadministration and directly employed labour.9.        We have to recognise that the  200 million cut in RSG does notrepresent a reduction in total public spo-iding, but only in spending by centralGovernment.    Its effect on total public expenditure is uncertain, and likelyto be much smaller, since many local authorities will be able to run downbalances rather than cut back their own spending, and any cuts that do resultmay only contribute to bringing the total back to its planned level. Therunning down of local authority balances again has a complex and unpredictableffect on the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR).    But a cut in theRSG would match the squeeze we are proposing to apply to other centralGovernment spending, and would in my view be the best way of ensuring thatlocal authorities begin this year to cut out waste and rein back theirexpenditure - a process which can be carried further in the survey andRSG negotiations later in the year.DISPOSALS10.       Because the scope for reductions this year is limited, we need to lookalso at the possibility of selling off assets to reduce the borrowingrequirement.    This needs to be looked at in detail with the Departmentsconcerned, to take account of the particular circumstances in each of thenationalised industries which are the main candidates.    Legislation wouldbe necessary in most cases, but not for the sale of British Petroleum (BP)shares or British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) assets. Preciseproposals on amounts and timing can only be made after detailed reviews,which I propose the Departments concerned should undertake, in consultationwith the Treasury, and with the nationalised industries themselves, to makethe maximum feasible contribution in the current year.    But on presentinformation we should be able to raise some  750- 1, 000 million (in PSBRterms) from disposals this year without overloading the market.    It needsto be noted that although this would produce a once-for-all reduction in thePSBR, it would not reduce public sector demands on real resources; and inso far as private sector funds were diverted from buying gilts etc., thePSBR effect would not be carried through into a reduction of DomesticCredit Expansion (DCE) and money supply.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONTINGENCY RESERVE11. A further contribution could be made by cutting the 1V79-80 ContingencyReserve, which is the amount available within the current planning total tomeet new decisions to add to the volume of spending in the course of the year.It stands at  835 million (1979 Survey prices).    There are already risks ofoverspending on local authority current expenditure (paragraph 7 above) andnationalised industries (unless early decisions are taken to increase pricesin line with cash limit assumptions);  and the need could arise to offsethigher expenditure on demand-determined services, eg. social security ifunemployment is higher than assumed.    We are committed to paying aChristmas bonus to pensioners, which at  10 would cost  108 million.Departments have reported that about  120 million of expenditure wasdeferred from 1978-79 to 1979-80 by the Civil Service industrial action, andI propose that we should make provision for this.    Other foreseeable claims(eg. Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and European Economic Community(EEC) budget) could amount to a further  150 million or so.    We need tokeep something in reserve for genuine unforeseeable contingencies.    But ifCabinet is prepared to take a very firm line against any further deliberateadditions - in particular, any social security uprating beyond our minimumcommitment - then it would be possible to cut the Reserve by say 300 million.    I shall invite Cabinet to take a decision on this when we havereached a view on the social security proposals.12. Whatever decision we take on the size of the Reserve, it will beessential to keep expenditure within the planned total by ensuring that novolume addition is made without being met from the Reserve.    The cost ofnew measures, or estimated additions to the -ost of existing measures,should be met as far as possible within the existing total for the relevantprogramme, by finding offsetting savings.    When this is not possible, aclaim on the Contingency Reserve can be considered.    But unless theCabinet take an explicit decision to increase the total, the ContingencyReserve should represent a limit on decisions to add to the volume of publicexpenditure programmes during the year.    The use of the ContingencyReserve in this way entails that acceptance of a claim on the reserve forone purpose pre-empts to that extent the scope for other extra expenditure.Decisions to commit a significant part of the Reserve to one area ofexpenditure rather than another should therefore be made by the Cabinet asa whole.    It follows that major claims on the Reserve, or other claimswhich Treasury Ministers are not themselves prepared to accept, shouldbe referred by the appropriate Ministerial Committee to the Cabinet for adecision.PROCEDURE13.       Subject to the views of Cabinet on the proposals in this paper, Ipropose to hold bilateral discussions in the next week or so with theMinisters concerned on the proposals for specific cuts listed in the Annex,in time to report to Cabinet with my recommendations in the light of thesetalks, for approval before the Budget.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFURTHER SAVINGS14. The proposals in the Annex total nearly  750 million at 1979 Surveyprices.    This will be in addition to the squeeze through cash limits butagainst it must be offset any increase we make in eg. the defenceprogramme.    But more will be needed to enable us to make the impactthrough direct tax cuts in this Budget which we all want to see.15. I therefor^ urge my colleagues to consider personally whether theycan offer any further savings from their programmes in 1979-80, forexample by bringing forward some of the savings they will be proposing forlater years.CONCLUSION16.       I invite Cabinet to agree that:i. the proposals listed in the Annex should be discussed withMinisters concerned, after which I should report back to Cabinetwith my recommendations.ii. A reduction in the rate support grant to local authorities of 200 million should be made on the lines proposed in paragraphs 7-9.iii. There should be detailed reviews of the scope for selling assets(paragraph 10), with the intention of raising some  750- 1, 000 millionin the current year,iv. We should take a decision on a cut in the Contingency Reservein the light of what we decide on the relevant social securityproposals.v. The Contingency Reserve should be used as an operationalinstrument to ensure that any decisions to add to expenditure arecontained within the planned total, as proposed in paragraph 12.vi. Ministers in charge of spending Departments should considerurgently whether they can offer any further savings in 1979-80.W J BTreasury Chambers14 May 1979CONFIDENTIAL

Substantial shortfall can be expected,particularly on new house building,  in additionto the  140 million taken up by higher pricesthan assumed in setting the cash limit.    But toensure the full saving and to prevent localauthorities from switching the cash to otheractivities,  such as council house improvementsand mortgage lending,  the cash limits should becut.Local authorities should be pressed to raise 25rents.    This could be done either by a furtherincrease in the  1979-80 rent guideline to 70p.a week (about 12 per cent)  - 20p.  above presentaverage);  or by cutting the percentage subsidypayable on the &quot;new capital costs element&quot; ofexpenditure from 66 per cent to 60 per cent byaffirmative Order.    Neither would enforce a rentincrease on local authorities this year (theycould ignore guidance or make up reduced subsidyout of rate funds);  but there should be someeffect.Health ServicePrescription charges could be increased from 4020p. to 60p.  from 1 August, by negative Order(worth  65 million in a full year).    When lastincreased in 1971,  the charge of 20p. wasequivalent to 56p. now.Other miscellaneous charges - eg dental charges 15and certain family planning services  (but notophthalmic charges)  - might also be increased.Education - -The! school meal charge could be increased from 2425p. to 35p.  at the beginning of the autumnterm (ie by 10p.,  instead of the 5p. alreadyannounced,  on which in any case an early negativeOrder will be needed).The pilot scheme for awards to l6-l8 year olds 10in full-time education has lapsed with theprevious Government1s Education Bill.er current expenditure could yield savings in theral squeeze on local authority spending - paragraph 9he main paper.)1
