CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 2012 June 1979COPY NO76CABINETCAP PRICES AND GREEN POUND DEVALUATIONMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and FoodINTRODUCTION1. The Ministerial Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy, Sub-Committee on European Questions (OD(E)) discussed on 11 June the line Ishould take on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) prices and the Green Poundat the Council of Ministers on 18 June.    This paper seeks Cabinet decisions.CAP PRICES2. The Commission has proposed a freeze on common prices for virtuallyall commodities;  and a substantially increased co-responsibility levy on milkproducers (with extensive exemptions for small producers), varyingaccording to the level of European Economic Community production. TheFrench want to force through a general price increase of 2 per cent, so as toenable Germany to cut her monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) withoutreducing prices to German farmers.    Only Italy (unreliably) joins us insupporting the Commission^ price freeze, and recent rises in production costshave led to further pressures for price increases.3-        It is essential to hold down support levels and the resulting high cost ofthe CAP as far as possible.    We must therefore try to dissuade theCommission from shifting far from a total price freeze.    If they proposetoken increases, involving only minor budgetary cost, for products not inserious surplus, we should be prepared to concede this much, thus showingourselves more reasonable and constructive than our predecessors.    But we&quot;lust stand firm on the commodities in serious surplus - pre-eminently milkand sugar;  reject a milk levy that discriminates unacceptably against UnitedKingdom producers;  and ensure that the average price increase is thesmallest since Accession.    We must clearly try to avoid becoming isolated.But in the last resort we must be prepared to see the negotiations break downQn these issues.     OD(E) endorsed this approach.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALGREEN POUND4. The failure of the previous Government to devalue the Green Poundand so increase farm support prices sufficiently was a central feature of ourElection campaign.    We are committed to put our farmers on level terms ofcompetition with the rest of the Community during the present Parliament.5. Despite good weather and high production farmers&apos; total net incomewent down in 1978 by 13 per cent in real terms.    Farmers&apos; costs willincrease this year by at least lZj per cent, with wages up by 11 per cent,rents 15 per cent, fertilisers, machinery and feed 10 per cent, oil 20 per cent.Bank borrowings are 25 per cent up on last year.    Without a further GreenPound devaluation real net income is expected to fall in 1979 by a further10-15 per cent, with disastrous effects on confidence and investment. Thereis a crisis in the pig industry, where because of excessive MCAs on importsthe herd is already 15 per cent down on 1973, bacon factories are closing andpig producers losing money.6. I propose a general Green Pound devaluation of l\ per cent. Withnormal weather this should just prevent a fall in real net income below lastyear&apos;s unsatisfactory level.    It is the minimum needed to restore confidence,encourage investment and increase productive potential.    It would increasethe Retail Price Index (RPI) by 0. 5 per cent eventually, reduce publicexpenditure by  4 million and reduce the Public Sector Borrowing Requirementby  44 million.7. When OD(E) discussed this, the Financial Secretary, Treasury, arguedthat even 0. 5 per cent on the RPI was too much in the light of other expectedprice increases and proposed a smaller devaluation.    But agriculture is oneof the few sectors of the economy whose competitive efficiency on level termscan be relied on to reduce imports and increase exports.    To depress itsproductive capacity by inadequate measures now would therefore contradict notmerely our statements on agricultural policy but the whole direction of oureconomic strategy.    The farmers1 unions are asking for 10 per cent:    5 percent would be regarded as the bare minimum any Government would findnecessary and not as the more positive approach we promised.Q-        Given that 1978 margins were themselves unsatisfactory, the differenteffects of devaluations of 5 per cent and l\ per cent on the change in real netmargins (1979 compared with 1978) for the main commodities show that any-thing less than l\ per cent is wholly inadequate:-	5%	7*%Milk	-4%	-3%Beef	No change	t8%Wheat	-17%	-12%Sugar Beet	t3%	4-10%	2	CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL9,        For pigs, a 5 per cent devaluation would reduce the MCA on competingDanish bacon from  105 to  61 per tonne at today&apos;s exchange rate.    This wouldnot be enough to safeguard either processors or producers from furtherdecline.    Even l\ per cent leaves the MCA undesirably large at  58.    I wouldtherefore propose to follow French precedent by seeking the elimination of theMCA through an additional devaluation of up to 5 per cent for pigmeat only (itwould apply to other products in 1980-81).    There is no real chance of securingthis, because of other countries&apos; opposition;  but it is important to be seen totry, and the attempt may help secure our aims in other areas of thenegotiation.CONCLUSION10.       I invite my colleagues to endorse:-i. The approach suggested in paragraph 2 of CAP prices.ii. A Green Pound devaluation of l\ per cent, with effect from2 July.iii. A bid, as a negotiating tactic, for an additional devaluation of upto 5 per cent for pigmeat only.P WMinistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food11 June 19793CONFIDENTIAL
