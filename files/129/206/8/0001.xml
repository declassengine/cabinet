CONFIDENTIAL 5 VfMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 816 May 1979CABINETCOPY NO    ^ gTEACHERS&apos; PAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State forEducation and Science1. Since the discussion in the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy on 14 May 1979 I have seen the leaders of the Management andTeachers&apos; Panels of the Burnham Primary and Secondary Committeeseparately.THE STANDING COMMISSION POSSIBILITY2. The Management Panel would be content with the amendments wepropose to the agreed terms of reference if they were conveyed by theGovernment to the independent Chairman of the Committee, but would notwish to prejudice their relations with the teachers by taking the initiativein proposing such amendments.    The leader of the Teachers Panel hasemphasised to me the very great difficulty that he would face in seekingto persuade a majority of his Panel to take the same view, but I am gladto say he has not entirely ruled out the possibility.    As both I and thelocal authority leaders consider that the Standing Commission route ismuch to be preferred to the dangers of arbitration, I think we must continueworking to try to turn this possibility into a reality:  and the followingpoints then arise.3. In the Economic Strategy Committee we decided that the terms ofreference should say:-&quot;... undertake a comparability study of the pay and conditionsof service ...&quot;This is technically incorrect, in that neither the Burnham Committee northe Standing Commission actually settles conditions of service:  we secureaccuracy and lose nothing by saying instead:-&quot;. .. undertake, in the light of their other conditions ofservice, a comparability study of the pay ...&quot;This small amendment would avoid unnecessary technical complications.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. The teachers will of course regard these amendments to theagreed terms of reference as a loss to them which should be compensatedby some further concessions elsewhere.    A revised offer designed topersuade them into acceptance would, in my judgment, have to containat least the following components:-a. Certain desirable structural changes which would havethe effect of bringing the 9 per cent increase on rates up to9. 3 per cent increase overall.b. Some kind of payment on account, say   1 per week forteachers earning up to about  5000, to be &quot;clawed back&quot; fromthe results of a Standing Commission study.c. Improved staging:  the local authorities and the teachersknow that the former Government would have been preparedto accept January 1980 and January 1981, and a settlementnow might require   the second stage to be advanced toSeptember 1980; andd. Rate Grant Support for expenditure arising in 1979-80from the settlement.5. The assurance of Rate Support Grant support for whatever is tobe offered is central.    The local authorities will not move without it;nor could I offer any logical defence of agreeing with them in the jointManagement Panel that certain offers were right and necessary, yetrefusing to pay the Governments appropriate share of the cost. Itherefore strongly support the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s, recommenda-tion (in paragraph 8 of C(79) 5) that the necessary squeeze on localgovernment in the present financial year should be applied directly andat a level of our deliberate choice, and not indirectly and arbitrarily byexcluding some components of some pay settlements from the definitionof relevant expenditure.6. It has to be accepted that the Standing Commission, given the work-load they have already undertaken, would be unable to deliver theirrecommendations on teachers&apos; pay until well into 1980.    The teachers,on realising this, may react by asking for a specified first atage (say,of 5 per cent) so that it could be put into immediate payment from thechosen date (say, January 1980): instead of half of some quantity which,because it had not yet been determined, could not be put into paymentuntil some months later.    This would be a reasonable request in thecircumstances of the long delay that they would face, and a specific5 per cent first stage with the balance to come as the second stage wasindeed part of the settlement with the Civil Service.    I consider that wechouldbe prepared to agree to this variation if the teachers asked for it.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALNEGOTIATIONS AND ARBITRATION7. If (as remains most likely) no agreement proves, possible, we mustinstead concentrate on the option of negotiations in the Burnham Committeeleading to arbitration.8. I have not discussed this possibility at length with the teachers,but it has been made clear to me that they will be unwilling to seekarbitration unless there is a substantive response to their relativitiesclaim.    Moreover, even if the Management Panel proposed it, theindependent Chairman would find it hard to rule - as he must - that thepossibility of negotiations had been exhausted in the absence of such aresponse.9. I discussed this problem constructively and in detail with the localauthority leaders in the Management Panel, so that we might together beas ready as possible to deal with situations as they arise in the course ofFriday&apos;s Burnham Committee Meeting.    Though they naturally could notcommit themselves precisely today, we identified together possibilitiesthat I must invite my colleagues to consider:-a. the local authority leaders are strongly of the view thatthey need to make a substantive response to the full claim forrestoration of relativities if industrial action is to be suspendedduring the 6-week arbitration process and they are to be in acredible posture at arbitration;b. such a substantive response would most probably have toinclude the 9. 3 per cent and an additional payment of (say) 1 per week now by way of advance as described in paragraphs 4a.and b above;  and subsequent staged offers for January 1980 and(say) September 1981;c. different views were expressed as to the pattern of the3 stages of offer now in contemplation (some of the localauthority leaders thinking, for example, that it might bewiser to go as far as 12 per cent from April 1979 in- thehope of staving off arbitration): but the view of all of us wasthat the 3 stages together would have to approach 25 per centin aggregate to be sure that the independent Chairman wouldbe persuaded that the Management Panel had made aresponsible response and that, failing agreement, there shouldbe resort to arbitration;d. there should be Rate Support Grant support for allexpenditure in 1979-80 resulting from the offers.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALCONCLUSION10. I think we must accept that the chances of going by agreement downthe Standing Commission route are now slim.    Both I and the localauthority leaders continue to think, however, that this route is to bepreferred and that we should not abandon it while any chance remains.I therefore ask for my colleagues&apos; agreement to our negotiators in theManagement Panel using their discretion within the limits indicated inparagraphs 4 to 6 above to secure an agreement on this basis if theypossibly can.11. Should this fail, I must be ready to work with the local authoritiesto enable the Management Panel to make a realistic offer which can bedefended as a responsible reply to the teachers claim and secure for us,if not an agreement, at least a basis on which the matter could go toarbitration.     For this purpose I seek my colleagues&apos; view on the extentto which the Management Panel should be allowed to make offers in oneor more of the alternative directions indicated in paragraph 9.    It wouldbe disastrous for our relationships and our public standing if we finishedon Friday with quarrels with both the teachers (over the terms ofreference and the offer) and the local authorities (over Rate SupportGrant support) and with the independent Chairman refusing arbitrationbecause he judged that the Management Panel had not made a responsiblereply.12. I annex additional factual information requested by the EconomicStrategy Committee.M CDepartment of Education and Science16 May 1979CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEXFACTUAL INFORMATION RELATING TO TEACHERS&apos; CLAIMp^Hrnia Government&apos;a CommitmentThe previous Government had promised normal RSG backing for 9% from1 April and the payment of one half of the result of a comparabilityexercise on 1 January 1980 and the remaining half on 1 January 1981.Normal RSG support for the outcome of arbitration was also promised.The Education BudgetJhe 1979/80 RSG settlement provided for total local authority expenditureon education in E 6 W of just over  6.2 billion   (at November 1978 prices).(This figure excludes some  400 million net expenditure on the schoolmeals service; and a further  210 million plus on libraries, museums,galleries etc).   Teachers1 pay represents some  3.6 billion of this orapproaching 60$.Coated OptionsI attach a table showing the cost of the various elements underconsideration, broken down into schools and further education and intototal cost, central Government costs and local authority costs underpresent RSG arrangements.   Significant features are that:-i. An extra 0.3% for improved structure is financially insignificant.ii. A first stage of 8$ (consistent with a total 25$ settlement)would cost a total of  185m from 1 August 1979 and  69m from1 January 1980.Payment on Account.  Seperate calculations show that a payment on account of  1 a week from1 April 1979 could be clawed back within 1979-80 from the lowest paidteacher if he receives a 3$ staged increase from 1 August 1979 or a 7%increase from 1 January 1980.   So long as such a payment is clawed backwithin the financial year, it carries no cost and is not subject to DESveto.
Numbers of Teachers5. There were 433 thousand teachers in maintained nursery, primary andsecondary schools in January 197** and there were V?1 thousand inJanuary 1979*   The pupil/teacher ratio overall was 20.6 in January 1974and an estimated 18.9 in January 1979*(No information is available about staff other than teachers).Annual Wastage6. Annual wastage of teachers in the maintained sector was 10.*$ in 1974.75;7.7* in 1976-77 and is estimated to have been 6-7* in 1977-78.Supply and Demand7. In 1974, policy was based upon a general shortage of teachers. There iscurrently over-supply because of Government constraint on local authorityexpenditure and low wastage rates resulting from economic recession. InMarch 1979i nearly 8,000 teachers in England were registered with theDepartment of Employment as unemployed and seeking teaching posts. There Iare still, however, shortages of teachers in important subjects, notablymathematics, physical science and craft/design/technology.Class Contact Time8. Non-contact time is not used only for administration: time is needed alsofor -preparation and markingproduction of materialsexamination workcareers guidancepastoral workin-service trainingliaison outside the schoollibrary supervisionTeachers&apos; contact time has remained high and constant at 78% in bothJanuary 1974 (England and Wales) and January 1978 (England).20
