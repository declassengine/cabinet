CONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT80C(79) 2218 June 1979COPY NOCABINETMEMBERS OF PARLIAMENT AND MINISTERS&apos; PAYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster1.       The Twelfth Report from the Review Body on Top Salaries (TSRB),recommends revised current levels of pay for Members of Parliament (MPs) an;Ministers, new rates for the Peers&apos; Expense Allowance and an interimincrease in Members1 Secretarial and Research Assistance Allowances. Afurther substantive report on the Secretarial Allowances and certain otherremaining points is expected shortly.THE PARLIAMENTARY SALARY2. The Review Body draw attention to the fact that the Parliamentarysalary has not been brought properly up to date for 7 years, and arguestrongly for the introduction of a revised figure of  12,000 with effect fromthe due date of 13 June 1979.    This represents an increase of 74 per centover the current rate of  6, 897 and of 28 per cent on the rate ( 9, 372) usedfor pension purposes.    The Review Body do not themselves recommendstaging of the increase, but recognise that the Government may need topropose this course to the House; in this event they suggest that fullimplementation should be completed by 1980.    The cost of full implementationwould be about  2.8 million in a full year.3. The increases recommended are large (74 per cent for MPs and anaverage of 95 per cent for Ministers and Office Holders).    However, theymust be seen in context.    It is 7 years since the salaries were last broughtfully up to date.    Since January 1972 prices have risen by nearly 160 per centand average earnings by nearly 200 per cent.    It is 4 years since the lastindependent review but MPs&apos; current salaries are still below the levelrecommended then and Ministers&apos; pay is only a little above its 1972 levels.There is no obvious basis for challenging the figures on their merits. Theyare consistent with trends in prices and earnings and are consonant withother recommendations from the Review Bodies.    (The Lord Chancellor1 scurrent salary is for example related to that recommended for the Lord ChiefJustice. )1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLINKAGE &apos;4. The Review Body were asked to re-examine the question of a salarylink for Members in the light of the strong views held by many Members, asevidenced by the passing of the 1975 Resolution which expressed thedesirability of a link with the Assistant Secretary grade in the Civil Service&quot;.. . not later than 3 months after the next General Election ...TSRBhave re-examined this issue carefully but have repeated the conclusionreached in their First and Seventh Reports that a link to a particular groupwould be wholly inappropriate.    They believe that a better course would beto reflect movements at levels of pay comparable to the salary of an MP.In short, they conclude that it would be right for Members1 pay to be subjectto independent substantive review every 4-5 years with updating in theinterim years on the basis of a link with an appropriate point in the NewEarnings Survey (published annually by the Department of Employment inOctober).5. There are a variety of factors to be considered here.    There is avery strong body of support in the House for some kind of linkage, and inparticular for a link with the Civil Service.    Members are naturallyconcerned about the invidious position in which they find themselves inhaving to make a decision affecting their own personal interest, and it isargued that this situation tends to inhibit the House from voting a realisticsalary for its Members.    The strength of feeling among Members on thisissue can be seen from the support given to the following Resolution of theHouse passed in 1975:-&quot;That in the opinion of the House it is desirable in principle that thesalaries of members should be regulated to correspond with a pointon the scale paid to an Assistant Secretary in the public service, notlater than three months after the next General Election, and annuallyuntil that date, the salaries of Members should be increased by notless than the same amount of increase as these Assistant Secietaries.6. We must weigh against this the TSRB&apos;s clear contrary views whichwill of course be made public.    Moreover, we should recognise that shouldwe choose to reject the Review Body&apos;s views and go for a link for examplewith Assistant Secretary we might be faced with increases considerably inexcess of those already recommended.    A link with a lower grade on theother hand might be objected to in the House.    Further, we should recognisethat, even on the basis of the link proposed by the Review Body, Members&apos;pay may well be at such a level as to leave no room for the irregularsubstantive reviews every 4-5 years to recommend any further increase.For example, the  8, 000 recommended by TSRB in 1975 would have beenupdated to  11, 712 in 1978 and probably above  12, 000 this year. Finally,we should recognise that if we accept linkage^we will face public charges of^yg^not only having index-linked pensions but also index-linked pay.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL(7. Nevertheless, having regard to all these facts and especially thestrong feeling in the House, I believe that our best course i&quot; either to acceptthe TSRB&apos;s views and propose to the House interim updating on the basis ofthe New Earnings Survey, or to accept in principle that there should be a linkwith the Civil Service.    Further detailed work would be necessary toestablish precisely what Civil Service rate would be appropriate, andwhether it would remain necessary to subject the levels to continuingindependent review every 4-5 years. jMINISTERS1 ABATED PARLIAMENTARY SALARY8. The counter-inflation measures of 1975-79 led to three rates ofParliamentary salary being in force for Ministers ( 3, 529 Cabinet,  4,299non-Cabinet,  4, 642 Whips) whereas a common rate existed previously.TSRB recommend a new common rate of  7, 000 representing increasesranging from 51 per cent to 98 per cent on the current rates at a cost ofabout  250, 000 per annum.MINISTERS&apos; AND OFFICE-HOLDERS&apos; PAY9. The Review Body&apos;s last recommendations on Ministers&apos; pay (ReportNo 8) were not implemented because of the previous Government&apos;s counter-inflation measures;  these salaries are thus even more out of date than thoseof Members.    Individual increases ranging between 50 per cent and 150 per cen(and in the case of the Deputy Chief Whip Commons, 209 per cent and ChiefOpposition Whip in the Lords 239 per cent) are recommended in the currentreport resulting in an average increase on the salary bill of 95 per cent. ThePrime Minister&apos;s salary would be raised from  22, 000 to  33, 000 and aCabinet Minister&apos;s from  14, 300 to  25, 000.    In place of the present 8,250- 10, 450 range for Ministers of State, two distinct salary levels arerecommended -  20, 000 for Ministers in charge of Departments but outsidethe Cabinet and  17, 000 for other Ministers of State. ParliamentarySecretaries move from  6, 050 to  13, 000 and the Whips from  4, 400 to 11, 000.   The cost of implementing these proposals would be around 900, 000 per annum.    The TSRB have noted that the work of the Leader ofthe Opposition has greatly expanded in recent years and they haverecommended a 110 per cent rise to  22, 000 per annum.10-       TSRB are known to be strongly critical of the current position onMinisters&apos; pay; they have voiced objections both in top salaries reports andm evidence to a Select Committee.    They are particularly concerned thatthe salary of the Lord Chief Justice exceeds the Lord Chancellor&apos;s and thatthe exceptionally low pay of the Lords&apos; Whips could have an adverse effect0I* business.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALiSECRETARIAL AND RESEARCH ALLOWANCE11, The TSRB intend to return to this allowance in their next Reportwhich may be expected shortly.    For the present they propose a modestinterim increase of  400 to  4, 600 per annum.PEERS&apos; EXPENSE ALLOWANCE (PEA)12. The Review Body&apos;s previous recommendations (Report No 9) fordividing PEA into separate claimable elements was not adopted by theprevious Government.    Instead, the existing daily maximum of  13. 50was retained but a higher figure of  16. 50 was introduced for Peers stayingovernight in London.    In their current report, the majority view of TSRBis that the earlier recommendation should stand.    They feel that thereshould be clear guidance for Peers on which items of expenditure may beclaimed, and that it should be incumbent on Peers to distinguish betweencertain broad categories of expenditure in submitting a claim.    The newrecommended maximum for each item is:Overnight subsistence  18.50Day subsistence and incidental travel   9.00Secretarial costs, postage and certainadditional expenses   8. 50IMPLEMENT AT ION13. There seems no basis for taking issue with the recommendations ontheir merits, particularly having regard to the rise in prices and earningssince the last reviews.    Moreover, these recommendations appear consistentwith other recent recommendations from the three Review Bodies.14. There are obvious difficulties about implementing increases inParliamentary pay and allowances at any time.    Such increases, howeverwell founded, will always provoke comment, and there is an argument forfacing this difficulty at an early stage of Parliament and immediatelyimplementing the full recommendations.    This action would be presentedas giving Members and Ministers an appropriate income for the first timein 7 years.    Deferring acceptance in some form will not make the problemgo away; it will return in future years in a more acute form.15-       However, the arguments for recommending a staged increase areeven stronger.    This would be consistent with our action on the other recentReview Body Reports (except that on the Armed Forces where for specialreasons we agreed on immediate full implementation) , whereas immediateimplementation of the full amount would be criticised as giving MPs andMinisters a better deal than recent public service settlements.    There is4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmoreover always the consideration that we should continue to set an examplein the matter of pay restraint.    In the event of a decision to stage theintroduction of the new rates, tne TSRB recommend that the full amountsbe promulgated for pension purposes immediately.CONCLUSION16. I invite the Cabinet to agree that we should accept:i. The TSRB recommended salary levels for both MPs andMinisters and Office-Holders.ii. Implementation subject to staging ( of the options in the AnnexI recommend E or F).iii. The establishment of a linkage either with the New EarningsSurvey or with the Civil Service.iv. Immediate promulgation of the full salary levels for pensionpurposes.-V-:---Tnt^rim updating for MP,i m fcfae basis if 11m Now EnrningiSurvey.I understand that the Leader of the House of Lords would similarly supportadoption of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations on Peers ExpenseAllowance.17. Colleagues will recall that the expenditure in question is not subjectto cash limits.18. The House will be anxious to know what is contained in the Reportand, if Cabinet accepts the above recommendations, I would recommendthat we announce our decisions to the House by means of an arranged writtenParliamentary Question when the Report is published tomorrow.    A debatewould follow shortly after, in the week beginning 2 July.N St J SPrivy Council Office18 June 19795CONFIDENTIAL
