CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 7 COPY NO 7715 May 1979CABINETTHE ADJUSTMENT1 OF CASH LIMITS TO TAKE ACCOUNTOF CIVIL SERVICE PAY SETTLEMENTSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilINTRODUCTION1. In the course of the meeting of members of the Cabinet on 8 May,reference was made to the increase in public service staff costs arisingfrom the present round of pay settlements and to their effect on cash limitsand the matter was further discussed in Cabinet on 10 May(CC(79)lst Conclusions, Minute 1).    This memorandum examines the actionwhich should be taken to secure early savings in Civil Service staff costs.BACKGROUND2. The total staff of the Civil Service nov. numbers about 733, 000,divided between 566, 000 non-industrials and 167, 000 industrials. Ourpredecessors made provision for a Civil Service wages and salaries billin the 1979-80 Estimates amounting to  3, 744 million (this is pay of staffemployed by central Government Departments as shown in Table 5 of theChief Secretary1 s memorandum (Cmnd 7524).    It includes national insurance,the pay of locally engaged staff overseas, London Weighting and the cost offee paid staff.    It excludes the 25, 000 staff of the Trading Funds, for whomno provision is made in the Estimates); this allows for pay increasesaveraging about 5j per cent from the due settlement dates (1 4.pril for non-industrial staff and 1 July for industrial staff).3. This provision made in the Estimates for wages and salaries hasproved to be substantially below the cost of this year&apos;s Civil Service paysettlements.    The settlement for the non-industrial Civil Service, payablein stages from 1 April, is Hkely to amount to around 16 per cent for thecurrent financial year, ie some 10 per cent or about  270 million above theprovisions made in the Estimates.    There will also be the settlement forthe industrial staff, the extra cost of which above the Estimates may be inthe region of  60 million this financial year.    In addition, the London1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALWeighting allowance has shortly to be decided; if it were to be fullyrevalued the additional cost in 1979-80 would be about  25 million.Therefore the excess for all Civil Service pay over the provision made inthe Estimates could be as high as  355 million.4. Clearly it would be wrong to adjust cash limits fully to pay for theseadditional costs.    We need to consider what savings can be obtained bysubstantial cuts in staff costs.    The previous Administration had in mind atarget for savings of at least 2 per cent, but we must do better than this.THE TARGET5. There is a range of options for cutting staff costs in this financialyear which colleagues will wish to consider.a. A 5 per cent reductionThis would mean saving the full-year cost of about 37, 000 staff, orabout  185 million.    This could only be achieved by imposing a totalban on all recruitment at least for the rest of the financial year.Though we may well have to make civil servants redundant when wecome to tackle functions (paragraph 11 below), redundancy offers noprospect of useful savings within this financialyear since 6 months1 noticeis required, and compensation payments would amount to many timesthe small salary savings achievable.b. A 4 per cent reductionThis would mean saving the full-year cost of about 29, 000 staff(about  150 million).    It could be achieved by a ban on recruitmentlasting for 6 months, followed by restraint for the rest of the year.c*        A 3 per cent reductionThis would mean saving the full-year cost of about 22, 000 staff(about  110 million) and would be compatible with a 3-month banfollowed by restraint.6. I am anxious that the Civil Service should make the maximumcontribution to savings in Government expenditure.    There are howeverlimits to what we can do in what remains of the first financial year andbefore we consider how to cut functions.    A recruitment ban is by naturean indiscriminate weapon, and I am bound to draw attention to some aspectsof the way it would operate.    The effects would vary with the length of theban, but obviously the operations most at risk would be those with the highestwastage rates and where redeployment is difficult.    This would hit operationsin big cities, especially London where wastage has been over 20 per centhigher than elsewhere, and some key areas of work, notably computer2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALinstallations employing about 14, 000 staff including some 4, 000 ExecutiveOfficer programmers where the wastage is 24 per cent compared with justover 5 per cent for Executive Officers generally.    There wculd be nocorrelation between the incidence of shortages rnd the priority of the work,and I am advised that the prisons, court services, social security operations,tax collection and the support of the Armed Forces could be at risk. Thereis also the danger of industrial action (see paragraph 10 below). Thegreater the reduction, the greater these risks will be, but colleagues willbe In the best position to judge how big a cut we can go for in the precentyear without unacceptable damage to the operations for which they areresponsible.7. Whatever target we select can only be achieved if all colleagues bindthemselves firmly to securing the planned level of savings within their ownDepartments.    The operation will fail if we agree a target in general termsbut then seek exceptional treatment for our own operations.    It is alsoessential, as the Chief Secretary has said in his paper (C(79) 5), that thecash limits that are settled in consequence of our decision should be strictlyadhered to.    We must therefore set ourselves an objective we can reach.8. Whatever target is agreed upon, it is possible that there may haveto be some exemptions from the planned savings.    It would be imperativethat these be very strictly limited, but in order to provide a small safetymargin and to allow for such exemptions as are collectively agreed I wouldpropose that cash limits be set, in agreement with the Chancellor of theExchequer, so that the overall adjustment allows for expenditure slightlyabove the target savings in staff costs, ie depending on whether the staffsavings target was 5 per cent, 4 per cent or 3 per cent the cash limitswould be adjusted to provide for an overall saving of 4 per cent, 3jj per centor 2j per cent respectively.A BAN ON RECRUITMENT9. We have already decided that there should be a ban on recruitment.If a 5 per cent target is agreed the ban will have to continue for at least therest of the financial year, but if we adopt a lower target, colleagues willwish to consider the length of the ban.    Whatever its length, we may alsoneed to agree some arrangements, which would need to be tightly defined,for a very limited recruitment of specialist and high-quality staff (forexample, computer programmers and accountants) who are in very shortsupply.THE REACTION OF CIVIL SERVICE TRADE UNIONS10. I must have early discussions with the Civil Service trade unionsabout both the temporary ban on recruitment and the planned saving in staffcosts before these are announced.    They have already indicated theiropposition to any arbitrary cuts and have said that they would strenuously3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALresist any cuts in staff numbers without a corresponding reduction in thework to be done.    The higher the target we select, and the more drastic theban on recruitment, the sharper their reaction will be, and we may have toface a further outbreak of industrial action.    Their reaction will be thestronger if they cannot be assured that measures of a broadly similar natureare being taken in other areas of the public service and that we axe notsingling out the Civil Service to bear the brunt of our search for economies.i cannot forecast what the attitude of the unions would be to a cut of 3 per cent;above that, however, we should be ready for real trouble.    We must stick towhatever we decide upon, no matter what action the unions take.FURTHER ACTION11. In the longer term we shall need to make much greater economies.While there may be some scope for manpower savings by discharging presentresponsibilities in a different way, it will be essential to determine whichfunctions of Government should be reduced or dropped.    The proposals inthis paper would provide us with a breathing space in which to review thefunctions of our departments.    I will bring forward proposals shortly abouthow this review for the longer term should be carried out.CONCLUSION12. I invite my colleagues:a. To select an overall target figure for savings in staff costsin 1979-80.b. To consider the length of and the arrangements for a ban onrecruitment.c. To agree to seek feasible ways of applying correspondingmeasures in other parts of the public service.d. &quot; To note the probable reaction of the Civil Service tradeunions.C SCivil Service Department15 May 19794CONFIDENTIAL
