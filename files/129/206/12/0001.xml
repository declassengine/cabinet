CONFIDENTIALCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79)1224 May 1979CABINETFURTHER ACTION TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF THE CIVIL SERVICEMemorandum by the Lord President of the Council1. As I promised in C(79) 7, I now put forward proposals for the greatereconomies in the Civil Service which we shall need to make for the longerterm, in parallel with economies in other public services.2. While a general cut across the board was the only practicable methodof securing initial savings in this financial year, this second and moreimportant operation should be more deliberate and more discriminating.We shall need to considera. which continuing functions can be conducted more efficientlyand economically;b. which functions we should curtail or drop altogether.Some changes can be made relatively quickly, but others will need moretime.   Some may need legislation.    Redundancy is expensive, and the morewe can do by natural wastage, the better.    I envisage a programme runningthrough the financial years 1980-81 and 1981-82.3. I suggest that we should take as a starting-point the sum allowed forstaff expenditure (defined in the Annex) in this year&apos;s cash limits as we haveadjusted them, and think in terms of what it would mean to reduce thisfigure by 10 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent over the next two financialyears.    For this purpose I would ask each Minister to let me have astatement showing:-a. the amount of the savings he would aim to find in hisDepartment by improving efficiency and cutting out waste.    There isa connection here with the returns which the Cabinet has alreadyasked for by 7 June.1COPY NO    ^ gCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. What further measures he would adopt, in order to bring hissavings up to the level of 10 per cent, 15 per cent and 20 per cent, byway of carrying out functions less intensively, cuttirg them back orstopping them altogether.    These meapures should be categorisedby difficulty (those which can be done with comparatively little pain,those which would involve some penalty to our policies and theeffectiveness of services and those which would call for majorpolitical decisions);  and by the length of time needed to achieve them.This information would enable me to put to colleagues for decision a range ofpossibilities and a timetable.4. This operation should be conducted in parallel with the PublicExpenditure Survey this summer, and should take account of any savings inCivil Service manpower arising from it;  conversely there may beconsequential changes in expenditure other than on staff arising from theoptions we select.    The savings agreed as a result of this operation willhave to be incorporated in the next Public Expenditure White Paper, so weshall need to reach our final decisions by early autumn.5. With this in mind, I suggest that Departmental returns should reachme by the end of July followed by Cabinet discussions and decisions inSeptember.IMPACT ON THE STAFF AND UNIONS6. We must try to win the understanding of the staff and the Civil Serviceunions.    My Department will keep in close touch with the National Staff Side;and I suggest that my colleagues will wish to do the same with theirDepartmental Staff Sides.CONCLUSION7. I invite my colleagues to agree:a. To set 1 April 1982 as the target date for the completionof these reductions.b. To let me have the statements proposed in paragraph 3 bythe end of July.c. That there should be appropriate consultations with theNational and Departmental Staff Sides.SCivil Service Department24 May 19792CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL&apos; ANNEXIThe expenditure to &quot;be reduced in the course of this operation..would be staff wages and salaries and the closely-related costswhich are commonly described as &quot;general administrative expenditure&quot;,eg travel, subsistence, postage and telephone bills.   Computers andoffice machinery would be excluded;   while the review of functionsmay lead to ending or modifying some programmes of mechanization,we should encourage them where they are cost-effective. Somesavings in accommodation costs may well result, but these are besttreated as a consquential.2.   The more detailed guidance which my department willcirculateif the proposals in this memorandum are accepted will includeguidance on the treatment of any variations between the starting-point of this year&apos;s provision as finally adjusted and the existingPESC baseline for 1 April 1982.
