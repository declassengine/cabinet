CONFIDENTIALOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 1711 June 1979COPY NO76CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1979-80Memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home Department1. The Queen1 s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) haveconsidered the Bills which Ministers have put forward for this Session&apos;slegislative programme.    We have sought to construct a balanced programmewhich will reflect our main political objectives as set out in the Manifesto andThe Queen&apos;s Speech, especially on matters affecting economic and industrialpolicy, trr.de unions, housing and education.    We have also sought to avoid, sofar as possible, the need for shortened Recesses or regular late sittings.Inevitably these considerations mean that some Bills of lesser priority willhave to be deferred until later in the Parliament.2. We propose a relatively short list of 43 main Bills, set out in Annex A.This list contains the &quot;Essential&quot; Bills which must be enacted during theSession, for example, to give effect to our obligations to the EuropeanEconomic Community or to make necessary financial provision for certainpublic bodies.    It embodies the most important &quot;Programme&quot; Bills, includingall those Bills which were promised in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    It confirms thepreliminary programme of 10 Bills, already approved for early introduction,on which I reported to the Cabinet on 17 May (CC(79) 2nd Conclusions,Minute 1).    Three of the Bills in the preliminary programme have beenintroduced and others are likely to be introduced later this week.3- In addition, we must provide for a number of &quot;Contingent&quot; Bills, someof which are likely to become Essential as a result of events during theSession.    These are listed in Annex B.    The Scottish &quot;Programme&quot; Bills areshown in Annex C.    Most of them should be suitable for Scottish GrandCommittee.    Finally, there are some other Bills of lower priority whichcould be introduced if they are accepted for Second Reading Committeeprocedure in the House of Commons.    These are shown in Annex D.4- Details of the Bills shown in the Annexes are provided in the paper(C(79) 18) which I am circulating separately for ease of reference.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. The programme for this Session must include a considerable number ofcontroversial and, in some instances, very long Bills which will be stronglyopposed.    We must expect that some of them, perhaps half a dozen, willrequire timetable Motions.    They must also reach the Lords in good time tocomplete their passage in an orderly sequence through that House, where atimetable procedure is not available.     These considerations apply particularlyto the Bills on Housing, Local Government Planning and Land, Education, TradeUnions, Employment Protection Acts (Amendment) and to those providing forthe disposal of assets.6. Bearing in mind the likely Parliamentary pressures, the Committeeare grateful to those of our colleagues who have agreed to shorten their Billsin order to help their passage.    It is especially important that those of us whoare sponsoring Bills should obtain policy clearance and drafting authority asearly as possible, and should see that instructions are sent to ParliamentaryCounsel for Bills to be drafted in good time for introduction.7. I invite my colleagues to:a. Note the Bills which have already been introduced.b. Agree that the other Essential and Programme Bills listed inAnnex A should be brought forward for early policy clearance anddrafting, with a view to introduction during the present Session.c. Note the Contingent Bills listed in Annex B, and agree that theyshould be brought forward if necessary.d. Agree that the Scottish Bills listed in Annex C, and the SecondReading Committee Bills of lower priority (Annex D), should be broughtforward as appropriate.e. Ensure that the arrangements for policy clearance and draftingenable the Essential and Programme Bills to be introduced in good timeto facilitate the management of Government business in Parliament.W WHome Officeu June 19792CONFIDENTIAL
