CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT1     C(79)3 COPY NO. ^11 May 1979CABINETSTANDING COMMISSION ON PAY COMPARABILITYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for Employment1. The Government need quickly to determine their attitude towards theStanding Commission on Pay Comparability, both generally as regards itscontinued existence and the work with which it was charged by the previousAdministration, and in relation to one or two outstanding negotiations,notably that of the pay of teachers.2. We attach at Annex A a note fey officials which sets out the basis onwhich the Commission was established, its membership under thechairmanship of Professor Clegg, the cases which had been, or were aboutto be, referred to it.3. It seems to us that there is little choice but to accept the existence ofthe Clegg Commission for the purpose of dealing with those cases which havealready been formally referred to it.    If the Government were to cancel thearrangements which have already been made, the important and so recentlytroublesome cases of employees in local authorities and the Health Service,including nurses, would inevitably be reopened, and there is no alternativebasis for fresh negotiations which would avoid a great deal of trouble.4. We shall all want to reserve judgment on the longer-term future ofthe Commission until we can review the results of its immediate work. Onthis basis, there are three further questions to be considered:a. New references:  the decision whether or not to admit anyfurther references rests with the Government.    The fact that theCommission already has work which will occupy it until the end of1979 may deter some potential demands anyway.    There are, however,two relatively minor cases, local authority craftsmen and BritishWaterways Board staff, which might well be added, since this hadeffectively been agreed between the parties and only the timing of theElection prevented formal reference.    We could also add teachers,1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALas part of the inheritance of immediate current negotiations, if wewished to choose this way of dealing with them, and on terms whichwere otherwise satisfactory.    Looking ahead, the one importantadditional case on which we might be pressed is the large and variedgroup of local authority white-collar staff.    But no decision on thisis needed yet.b. Terms of reference and membership:  the terms of referenceof cases already referred are less than satisfactory, but they wereagreed with the relevant parties and an attempt to change them wouldrisk reopening the basic negotiations with the employees affected.For similar reasons, we would think it a mistake to interfere withthe existing membership, but would propose to keep open the optionof strengthening the Commission with one or two additional members,particularly to give stronger representation of private sectormanagement.c. Evidence: the Government is free to give and publish bothgeneral and particular evidence to the Commission, but has not yetdone so.    Officials have, however, been working on possible generalevidence, and we attach at Annex B a draft which has been showninformally to Professor Clegg.    This covers important points whichwe would want the Commission to take into account.    The existingpresentation could be improved, and mere emphasis given to supplyand demand considerations.    Subject to amendments on these lines,however, we would see great merit in putting general evidenceforward, and doing so publicly.    We do not think it would prove to bean embarrassing commitment if subsequently we found the resultsof the Commission&apos;s work unsatisfactory.    (We understand that theConfederation of British Industry plan to put general evidence to theCommission, and that its general tenor and coverage is closelyparallel to that of the draft Government evidence. )CONCLUSIONS5,        We invite our colleagues to agree:a. that the Standing Commission on Pay Comparability shouldbe allowed to complete the work with which it has already beencharged on the basis previously arranged.b. That general Government evidence should be submitted tothe Commission and published as soon as convenient, in a suitablyamended version of the draft prepared by officials.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. That the references to the Commission already agreedbetween the parties for local authority craftsmen and BritishWaterways Board staff (paragraph 4a. above) should now be madesubject to the Ministers concerned being satisfied with the specifiterms of reference;  and that the question of referring teachersshould be decided on its merits in the light of the separateMinisterial discussions of that subject.G HJ PTreasury Chambers11 May 19793CONFIDENTIAL
ICONFIDENTIALANNEX ATHE STANDING COMMISSION ON PAY COMPARABILITYThis note describes the origins, membership and terms of reference ofthe Standing Commission on Pay Comparability.Origins2M    The Commission was established as part of a negotiation with 4 unionsrepresenting manual workers in local authorities, National Health Serviceancillaries and ambulancemen.    The previous Government was guided by&apos;two mainconsiderations: first, the belief that outside appraisal of certain publicservice pay claims, based on comparability, already firmly established in anumber of individual cases, would have to be extended to other groups; andthe further belief that it would be best to avoid ad hoc enquiries by separatebodies (which on past experience tend to develop a &quot;client bias&quot;) and seek todevelop a single and relatively systematic framework.Terms of Reference - General3.     There is no single document which contains the general terms of referenceof the Standing Commission (specific terms of reference are devised in agreementwith the parties for each of the references made to it).   Nevertherless thereare three sources of general guidance to the Commission: the initial statementby Mr Callaghan on 16 January when he indicated the Government&apos;s willingness toconsider comparability studies as a solution in public service pay settlements;Mr Callaghan1 s statement to the House on 7 March announcing the setting up of theStanding Commission; and the letters of appointment sent to the individual membersof the Standing Commission.4.     The key passage from the 16 January statement is -&quot;Some public service groups already make use of comparisons with rewardspaid to employees in the private sector in their negotiations. TheGovernment will be ready to see in some additional areas of the publicsector, other than those engaged in trading, where there is a differentset of negotiations, a greater role for comparability in determining pay.The guiding principle should be the achievement of comparable pay forcomparable work and comparable effort.    Where the employers and the unionsconcerned make a request, therefore, the Government will be prepared toagree to an investigation into the possibility of establishing, for parti-cular groups of workers, acceptable forms of comparison with terms andconditions for other comparable work.&quot;CONFIDENTIALi
CONFIDENTIAL5. The key passage from the statement of 7 March is -&quot;In my speech to the House on 16 January I commented on the presentmethod of fixing pay and conditions in some areas of the public servie;and expressed the Government&apos;s readiness to see a greater role formeasuring their pay and conditions by making comparisons with pay forcomparable work and effort in other occupations where both sides sorequest... The Government have a responsibility both to be fair to pub&apos;service employees and to avoid arrangements which could in themselvesprove inflationary.    Comparability studies must therefore be made in asystematic and thorough manner, taking all relevant factors into accomA Standing Commission on Pay Comparability is accordingly being set upthe Government to examine the terms and conditions of employment of paicular groups of workers referred to it by the Government, in agreementthe employers and unions concerned, and to report in each case on thebility of establishing acceptable bases of comparison, including compaiwith terms and conditions for other comparable work and of maintainingappropriate internal relativities.   Any further role for the Commissioeach case will be a matter for agreement between the Government and thiparties.&quot;6. The letters of appointment sent to the members of the Standing Commissirepeated, but did not further amplify the main points in Mr Callaghan&apos;s twostatements.7. Mr Callaghan also confirmed in the House of Commons, on 20 February tfcmanning levels, job security and inflation-proof pensions would be among thicriteria to be taken into account in comparability studies.8. , The Standing Commission is not free-standing from Government. Mr Callimade clear in his statement of 7 March that it is for the Government to reftcases to the Commission, in agreement with the parties. There is no righttaccess without Government approval: and there is no question of the Commissimaking awards unless this is asked for in the terms of reference of a speciicase.    The Commission reports to the Government in each case.Terms of Reference - Individual Cases9. Nine separate groups of public service workers have already been refeflto the Standing Commission. They are: local authority manuals; NHS ancill31ambulancemen; university manuals; university technicians; nurses; manual ai&apos;workers; professions supplementary to medicine; and ambulance officers. I&quot;of these cases the unions and employers concerned opted for the Commission&apos;2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrecommend actual pay levels on this occasion (not necessarily in the future)and the employers, the unions and the Government were committed to acceptingthe results.    In addition there are six groups where the previous Governmenthad approved pay offers which included a reference to the Commission but whereagreement was not reached in time for actual references to be made before theElection.    These groups were: local authority craftsmen; British Waterway Boardstaff; university teachers; schoolteachers (England and Wales); teachers incentral institutions in Scotland; and teachers in colleges of education in Scotland.The offer for the first two of those groups included asking the Standing Commissionto recommend actual pay levels.    Discussion with the other groups had not reachedthis point though the draft terms of reference which the English and Welsh school-teachers and their employers (with Government dissenting) had agreed immediatelyprior to the Election did not seek recommendations on pay levels, ie theCommission^ work was seen by them as a basis for further negotiation.10. The terms of reference for these various groups differ but those agreed forthe four original clients (local authority manuals, NHS ancillaries, ambulancemenand university manuals) can be regarded as the basic model.    The text agreed forthese groups is at Appendix 1,    They referred to &quot;terms and conditions forcomparable work&quot; but did not further elaborate the comparability process. Theenvisaged process can be divided into three parts; a study of the feasibilityof making use of comparisons; the carrying out of comparisons; and theimplementation of the comparisons.    In the earliest cases both sides said theywould accept the outcome of the Commission^ studies as a pay award.    It washowever always envisaged that, where the parties preferred, the findings ofthe Commission should be used as the basis of separate negotiations (as in theCivil Service PRU system).    It is known that Professor Clegg hopes that theCommission will be able progressively to move away from an award function andto concentrate more on providing relevant data to the parties.Membership11.

CONFIDENTIALAPPENDIX 1ERMS OF REFERENCE FOR LOCAL AUTHORITY MANUALS, ETC&apos;he Government wishes to encourage negotiators to consider comparability:xercises in the public services and the Government will be initiatingurther talks to this end.    The Government will now establish an independentnvestigation, a Standing Commission, to examine the terms and conditions ofworkers in the public services and to report on the possibility of establishinacceptable bases of comparison, including comparison with terms and conditionsfor other comparable work, and of maintaining appropriate internal relativitiesChe first groups to be investigated will be local authority manual workers,NHS ancillaries, ambulancemen and university manual workers.in particular the investigation should -i. assess the appropriate form of comparisons with terms and conditionsin other sections of the economy, and identify relevant comparators;ii. make suggestions on how such comparisons should be carried out andon the resources required for carrying them out;iii. make suggestions as to how the comparisons should be made availableto the relevant negotiators within the local authorities/NHS/universitiesiv. consult the parties to the agreement on how the results of thecomparisons of terms and conditions can be embodied in the relevantcollective agreements;v. following i. to iv. make recommendations which the Government andthe trade unions have undertaken to accept.    In the case of the localauthorities the Government undertakes to provide its share of the RateSupport Grant to enable them to implement the recommendation.CONFIDENTIAL
STANDING COMMISSION ON COMPARABILITYGOVERNMENT GENERAL&apos; EVIDENCE1. I The Government offers this general evidence to the StandingCommission as it starts its work on the first references made to it.It may be supplemented from time to time by other background material,and the Government may wish to submit particular evidence in relationto individual references.2. The Commissions task in each case will be to examine the feasi-bility of the comparability approach.    Subject to feasibility,  it willthen carry out a comparability study.    Paragraphs 3-8 beloiv&apos; set outsome general considerations which the Government believes are relevantto these aspects of its work.    In some cases the Commission may alsobe asked, with the agreement of the parties concerned,  to recommendlevels of pay in the light of its comparability studies.    This will beits task,  for example,  in relation to the first four groups referredto it.    Paragraphs 9-17 below set out considerations which theGovernment believes are relevant to the Commission&apos;s work when askedto recommend levels of pay. -.A.      CONSIDERATIONS RELEVANT IN ALL CASES :C, ....The Comparability Approach &apos; *3*     The use of disciplined comparability as a basis for determiningpay for the non-trading public services is a response to the absence-Of^a^marketable. outpu^against which a market wage can be determined.In the absence of such a market test there is a need for a permanentand rational system which produces fair results,  both from the pointof view of workers and from that of the tax payer and rate payer.Workers in the group concerned and in other groups need to be satisfiethat the resulting level of pay is fair and reasonable in the circum-stances of the group.    The public which meets the bill must be giventhe best value for their money,  which means that rates of pay should bat such a level as to result in a  service neither too  elabora,!&apos; ^normadequate.    These requirements can best be met by a system of payetermination whin produces rates of pay for public service workersbroadly consistent with those enjoyed by workers doing comparnhle worki comparable effort outside the public services.
h.      The technique of rigorous  job-for-job comparison is by far themost satisfactory basis for such a system.    It carries with it thenecessary discipline to reassure the workers concerned and the publgenerally that its results are fair.    By focusing, on the middle ofthe range of pay levels of the comparators it can avoid the tvrindangers of producing pay levels so high that they attract an undueproportion of the available labour or so low that the public servici]are unable to attract a fair share of it.    It will be important in.   presenting the results to bring out that there are a variety of cirstances,  including local labour market factors,  which may justify arange of pay among the comparators;  otherwise there may be a riskof consequential claims from those on lower rates in the privatesector and a&quot;resulting tendency for the whole range to move upwards(This paper returns to the question of labour supply in paragraphs_9-12 below).    In seeking to apply the technique of job-for-job&apos; comparison it may be found that hot all grades in a single pay strmture,  and indeed not all occupations,  have external comparators.However,  provided comparators for a sufficient number of benchmarkgrades can be-found,  the remainder can be dealt with by fixing interelativities.    Where sufficient comparators cannot be identified itbe necessary to use the technique of factorial comparison.    This apinvolves identifying the salient factors which go to make up a joband then seeking comparator jobs with similar factors.    VThilst notsatisfactory as  job-for-job comparison,  because its results are noprecise,  this technique provides a reasonable proxy._5---It.JLs some times-argued that .a fixed link to the Index of Avers]Earnings would be a satisfae^e-r-y method of determining public ser. pay.    This approach has crucial shortcomings.    It provides nocriterion for determining the appropriate pay of public service j0&apos;]-or for enabling the Government to defend the cost to the tax payerThe concept of holding a place in the earnings distribution is quiforeign to the comparability approach,   the principle of which islevel with comparable jobs,  not to hold a position relative to thof tlie economy.    It would most probably bring about one of the damentioned in paragraph h.    The result would be to impose a damagi&quot;nechthtilus;pe:tbi
jdity on the economy,  impairing its ability to adjust to realnomic developments.    Comparability,  on the other hand, permitsrelative position of public service jobs &quot;to change in line witht of their comparators.     (There is,  however,  less objection tong the movement in an appropriate index to up-date over a short-xod levels of pay indicated by surveys carried out some months beforeoperative date of recommendations.)is*uttciitapib,t iotConducting Job-for-job Comparisions r6      In the identification of analogues,  it is important to take themost representative, and..juTidest .selection of analogues.  JThi^ means thatthe selection should not be based solely or to an undue extent on thebest outside employers and that it should take account of ^employers ofdifferent sizes and not be weighted too much towards the largest. Itis also most important to avoid circular comparisons, ie  two or moregroups forming a closed chain,  each providing analogues for the other&apos;spay.    Constant care is needed on this score,  and it is desirable that-analogues - should be-sought outside &quot;the -groups in-the-public serviceswhose pay is determined by comparability methods.[7l The assessment of the overall level of rewards received by each ofthe ideritified analogues should include all forms of remuneration (basicpay, bonuses,  overtime,  incremental scales) and other conditions ofservice  (including hours of work,  amount of annual leave,   the provisionof pensions,  free meals,  subsidised loans,  and the provision of free[o^cheap cars).    Total receipts,  in terms of money and benefits in kind -the hours of work required to obtain them - can be measuredthmetically.    Other features of the comparable jobs (responsibility,xsfaction,  security,  liability to work unsocial hours, willingnessccept change -and inconvenience) irre &quot;less -easy-to -quantify. &quot;Theynevertheless,  important aspects of employment and should be includec
p8 Similar considerations to those outlined in the two preceding. paragraphs should apply as far as is practicable in the case offactorial comparisions-B CONSIDERATIONS RELEVANT IN RECOMMENDING PAY LEVELSLabour Market Considerations9 A shortage of labour in a public service occupation docs notnecessarily indicate that the pay being offered is too lov.&apos;.    There mabe a general shortage of labour available for the type of job in the*&apos;    economy,  in which case care must be taken in setting the public servij-   level not to pre-empt too large a share of the available-supply byeffectively becoming a market leader- _If the level is set too-high,would set off a chain of leap-frogging awards by other employers asthey sought to keep their place in the labour market.10 Similarly,  if pay rates are established at too high a relativelevel workers may be attracted who are over-qualified for the jobconcerned.    This would be a waste of the nation&apos;s resources, preventirl the-optimum use. of -qualified labour.    -The Government expressed itsconcern on this score in a report on &quot;Some Wider Implications of the. Industrial Strategy&quot; which was presented to the NEDC in December 1977There should be no question of paying more for qualifications whetheror not they are necessary for the &quot;job.11 &apos;   Another possible explanation of shortage in the public serviceis that the established complement for the occupation concerned is toohigh.    It may therefore be necessary to have regard to comparativemanning levels in the jobs being compared,  as a measure of comparabili-or-eTfort. .12        What is relevant to a comparability study,  therefore,  is the re)shortage/surplus of labour in a public sei-vice  compared with theposition generally for comparable work.    Obviously there may be tempo]&quot;fluctuations due to sudden expansion or contraction of the numbersrequired,  but if the relative supply position remains out of line forany length of time there must be a presumption that pay and/or otherconditions are not truly comparable and some reassessment is called f0^1fccc1ecc-.!!!mtcp;hirrrwlt  
In certain kinds of employment there may be strong tendenciesfor local labour markets to operate at pay levels   which differJisiderably reflecting many different local factors.    In suchcircumstances the comparison exercise should be careful.to avoid^elusions for national rates, of pay based on untypical areas.IRELEVANCE OF OTHER FACTORSrcls of Price Inflation **Price inflation affects the private and public sectorstally,  and is therefore,  in the Government&apos;s view not a relevantisideration in recommending levels of pay following an exercise ofnparison between the two sectors. .--&quot;Going Rate&quot; of Current Wage Increases   &apos; .&apos;- -&apos; -  -- ,. The current rate of-increase . in ^ay-jsettlements in the .economya whole is irrelevant to tlie setting of appropriate levels of payflscd on the job-for-job comparison process.    To allow pay settlementsto be influenced by ideas of a going rate would be a loose form ofindexation, which could bring with it the disadvantages outlined inparagraph 5 above.Low PavIn the Governments view the Commission&apos;s task is to establish,r-each public-service group-referred to them, Tfhat&quot; are&quot;the comparabletes of pay in other sections of the economy for comparable work andmparable effort,  talcing account-of other relevant -conditions,  and tocommend accordingly.    Questions of general income distribution and-distribution are the subject of wider Government and fiscal policiesWhich must apply to the whole economy.    The problem of low pay cannothe dealt with for particular public service groups in isolation,  but roushe tackled by other means across the private and public sectors*&quot;orally.    Comparability then comes into play to ensure thatBprovements in low pay generally arc properly reflected in the publicServices.
Cost and Staging &apos;17 Problems will arise if it transpires  that the pay levelsestablished according to the criteria above are widely different 1direction from the present levels.    If they are higher-,  this willinvolve additional costs.    The public purse is not bottomless: thGovernment needs to maintain a fiscal balance  consistent with itsgeneral economic and monetary policies.    Large increases in the pub!sector pay bill may endanger those policies and in particular the&quot;Government&apos;s objectiveagreed with&quot;the&quot;TUC,   to &quot;reduce the rate ofinflation to 5 per cent within 3 years.  The Government may need to&quot;stage-impleinentation talcing &quot;the &quot;economic effects into account. Theprinciple of staging has been accepted by both sides and theGovernment in relation to the references already agreed.    It may al&quot;be necessary to seek savings in public expenditure programmes to he]meet the cost of implementation.    Similarly if the indicated pay leare below current levels the Government would naturally stage theprocess of convergence through a period of &quot;mark time&quot;,   during whicta decline in real income would need to be accepted.
