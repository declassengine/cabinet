CONFIDENTIALENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NOMPs&apos; AND MINISTERS&apos; PAYMemorandum by the  Chancellor ot the Duchy of Lancaster1. Following the response of the House to our proposals for dealingwith the 12th report of the Review Body on Top Salaries (TSRB), theChief Whip has discussed with the 1922 Committee a possible package ofimprovements.    These include:-i.     a guarantee that the staging process would be completedirrespective of any pay freeze;ii.    an undertaking that MPs&apos; pay would be reviewed bienniallyby the TSRB;iii,    a commitment to update the 1980 stage, perhaps by furtherreference to Boyle, although no such commitment could be givenfor 1981 at this time.2. The 1922 Committee have now considered mis and the Chairman hasreported that, whilst the Committee is now prepared to concede staging,they wish to propose an alternative package comprising:-a. the salary of MPs to move immediately to  9, 372 per annum(the current pensionable rate) with Ministers and Office-Holdersto receive pro-rata increases;b. the balance of the recommended  12,000 to be paid in twoequal stages in June 1980 and Jnne 1981;c. updating in 1980, 1981 and indefinitely thereafter on thebasis of a linkage with one or more professions to be deviaedby TSRB.3. The main differences between our amended proposals as put forwardby the Chief Whip and those now suggested by the 1922 Committee are:-i.     The 1922  Committee proposes a larger increase thissummer - an extra  774 per annum for Members (35.9 per centon current salary instead of 24. 7 per cent), and pro-rata anextra  1, 724 per annum for a Cabinet Minister, and an extraC(79) 244 July 1979CABINET1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL 149 per annum abated Parliamentary salary for CabinetMinisters.    However a small number of Ministers and Office-holders would in fact be worse off under the 1922 proposals(see Annex for details).ii.     The 1922 proposals would commit the Government to updatingboth of the remaining stages of the implementation of TSRB 12thus going beyond what has been done for other TSRB groups andfor the Doctors&apos; and Dentists1 Review Body; andiii.    would imply updating on a continuing basis indefinitely withno independent review of that updating mechanism at all. Anopen-ended commitment such as this has only been given to thePolice and Armed Forces to date,4. In the light of what we now know of opinion in the Party we mustrecognise that, whilst the 1922 proposals before us go further than we hadoriginally intended, they have a certain merit.    There would be obviousdifficulties about accepting them after the public statement of our earlierproposals, but we must bear in mind the probability that we face a long,hard winter on the pay front and it would be most unhelpful for theGovernment to be defeated in the House on this matter at this time.5. However, if we are now prepared to move beyond the amendedproposals that the Chief Whip has been canvassing, I would see great meritin going slightly beyond the proposals of the 1922 Committee and adoptingthe original Boyle recommendation of paying 50 per cent at the first stage.This would move MPs1 pay to  9,448. 50 this June - an increase of 76.50 over the 1922 Committee&apos;s proposals - and a Cabinet Minister&apos;sto  19,650 - some  59 per annum above.    We would then be able torepresent our action as being in accord with the recommendations of anindependent Review Body and we could not be represented as having accededcompletely to the approach demanded by our backbenchers.    Obviously ifwe are to ask Lord Boyle to make further reports - on Members&apos; allowances,on the form of a future linkage of Members&apos; pay and of Ministers&apos; pay in thefuture - then there is advantage in accepting his recommendations wherepossible.    Moreover, the smaller is the difference between what we arefinally prepared to accept and what Boyle originally recommended, thegreater is the argument for moving to Boyle&apos;s recommendation itself.0-        As to the 1922&apos;Committee&apos;s proposals on linkage the only amendmentsthat I would recommend are that we should seek to have the link based onmore than one analogue and we should reserve our position about possiblefuture independent reviews of the linkage chosen; perhaps every 5 to 7 years.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL7.        Accordingly, in the light of all the factors, I recommend that we nowagree to adopt the proposals put to us by the 1922 Committee, increasedslightly to coincide with Boyle&apos;s original recommendation for June 1979and that we inform the Chairman of the Committee accordingly.    We shouldalso consider how best to launch urgent discussions with the other partiesto ensure the maximum support for our revised proposals.N. St. J.S.Privy Council Office4 July 19793CONFIDENTIAL
