CONFIDENTIALENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 2115 June 1979COPY NO80CABINETRATING REVALUATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Environment1. The Cabinet must decide quickly whether to continue with a generalrating revaluation, in England and Wales, for 1952.    The main issues areour policy on rating, and of public expenditure and Valuation OfficeManpower.    These were discussed in Home and Social Affairs Committee(H) on 13 June but unresolved and I was invited to prepare a paper inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer reflecting the pointsmade in the Committee discussion and submit it to the Cabinet.2. Current law requires a general revaluation every five years but theLabour Government postponed the one due for 1978 until 1982. TheValuation Office of Inland Revenue need about four years to execute a generalrevaluation, and in the current exercise have reached the stage of sendingquestionnaires to the occupiers of some 22 million properties; this hasprompted a good deal of public concern and speculation about thisGovernment&apos;s policy on domestic rating.    The next stages are of recording,analysis, valuation and comparison, but this will be less visible to thepublic until the new lists are published at the end of 1981.3. Total cost of the revaluation, in manpower, computers, etc is around 10 million of which some  3. 5 million has been expended.    Up to 1, 000additional permanent staff and some 400 casuals are needed for 3-4 years,and most are now in post.    Since the additional permanent staff hired couldnot be disposed of quickly, the net saving if the revaluation were cancelledwould be of the order of  5 million.    If the revaluation were suspended andrestarted a year or two later the  5 million so far expended would be wasted,and the full cost of  10 million (at 1979 prices) would be incurred at that time.THE RATING CONTEXT4&apos;       Longer term Government policy on rating will need further thought.An earlier Conservative commitment to abolish domestic rating Jias notbeen dropped, although we have made it clear (eg. in the Election Manifesto)that this must have a low priority.    The options we shall need to exploremeanwhile are:1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALi. Make abolition of domestic rates a firm objective for the1980s and review alternative sources of finance.ii. Leave the ultimate position open, preserving domesticrating and making short term improvements meanwhile.5. Whatever our eventual decision, we are committed to retaining non-domestic rating.    Domestic rating yields  2.3 billion annually, non-domestic gives a larger yield of  3. 5 billion, and this implies a commitmentto keep the rating system up to date for the sake of the non-domestic sector.ARGUMENTS FOR AND AGAINST CANCELLING THE REVALUATION6. In my view there is a compelling case for stopping the revaluation:i. Despite abortive costs of cancellation, and higher costsultimately of a later revaluation, we can save  5 million or so andmake manpower economies in the Valuation Office of Inland Revenueover the next 3 years;  this would contribute to other objectives ofthe Government.    But above all,ii. revaluation would fuel public grievances about domestic ratingand create an impression that the Government will preserve domesticrating indefinitely.    Cancellation would give a greater sense ofurgency in working out alternatives.iii. This presentational problem arises immediately since workon the revaluation is proceeding publicly and since, whatever wedecide to do, legislative action will be required early this Session ifwe are to avoid the extant statutory requirement of a revaluation for1981.    It will also arise, in force, in 1982 when the revaluation wouldmake itself felt.7-        Some of my colleagues in H Committee took another view. Theymade the following points:i. Abandonment of revaluation would appear to indicate that theGovernment had an alternative to domestic rating which they wereready to bring forward in the near future.    Some colleagues howeverconsidered that devising a viable alternative could only be a long-term objective and that therefore the revaluation should proceed.ii. Since domestic rating will at best persist well into the nextParliament and since we are committed in any case to preserve non-domestic rating they argue that regular revaluations are required tocorrect the anomalies and injustices that arise between differentratepayers - both domestic and non-domestic.    Anomalies in the2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpresent 1973 list are already causing problems which will be moresevere by the time of the new lists in 1982.    Further postponementor cancellation would exacerbate these difficulties, which would be amatter of great concern to local authorities.iii. They were concerned about the abortive expenditure of 5 million that had already been incurred especially if it weresubsequently decided to restart the revaluation. iiv. In Scotland a revaluation recently took place and ScottishOffice Ministers believe it to be highly desirable that the nextrevaluation should go ahead on the present statutory timetable unlessand until it becomes clear that an alternative to domestic rating canbe introduced.    In Scotland any decision to delay revaluation wouldrequire new legislation and the Secretary of State has no power topostpone a revaluation from year to year.EUROPEAN ECONOMIC COMMUNITY (EEC) AND INCOME DISTRIBUTIONASPECTS8. There are no EEC implications of cancellation of the revaluation.Income distributional effects are impossible to quantify;  there may be someunfairness between different ratepayers because of the continuance of theincreasingly out of date 1973 values, but this should not present an acuteproblem for a few years.CONCLUSION9. An urgent decision is needed both to end public speculation and toanswer several Parliamentary Questions that have now been tabled for oralanswer on 27 June.    I ask colleagues&apos; agreement to the cancellation of therevaluation.    I should like to make an immediate announcement to thiseffect, so that the Valuation Office can cease work on the revaluation directlyI would then take powers in any Local Government Bill this autumn toregularise the statutory position.M HDepartment of the Environment!5 June 19793CONFIDENTIAL
