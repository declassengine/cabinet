CONFIDENTIALOMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT0(79) 23 OftCOPY NO $I)3 July 1979CABINETREGIONAL INDUSTRIAL POLICYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry1. We agreed in Opposition that expenditure on regional policy,especially in its industrial aspects, was excessive and far from costeffective.    Expenditure under the Industry Act 1972 now runs at about 575 million a year.    We thought that it should be possible to save some 240 million of this.    Accordingly, on taking office, I and the otherMinisters most closely concerned set in hand a review of regional policyin order to identify in detail the ways in which expenditure could be cutand other improvements made.    The Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy, Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs (E(EA)) discussed theresults of that review on 28 June.    We did so on the basis of a paper bythe Minister of State, Department of Industry (Lord Trenchard) coveringa full report by officials (E(EA)(79) 13), which is summarised in the Annexattached.    We also had before us a paper by the Secretary of State forWales (E(EA)(79) 14) expressing his concern that we were being asked to gotoo far, too fast and that the proposals as they stood carried heavypolitical and economic penalties and should be modified.    His view wasstrongly supported in discussion by the Secretary of State for Scotland.2. Most other members of the Sub-Committee, on the other hand, feltthat given our objective to reduce public expenditure and eliminate waste,the proposed changes in regional policy were about right.    A number ofcolleagues, however, were concerned about the timing and presentation ofany announcement of the changes envisaged.    A number of Ministers feltthat the regional policy changes, on their own, were essentially negative.It would help considerably, they thought, if they could be presented in thecontext of a more positive Government programme to encourage enterpriseand stimulate investments, particularly in small firms.    One possibilityhere would be the scheme put forward by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment in his letter to me of 27 June, for substantial temporaryinducements for new investment this year.    Other accelerator proposalshave also been suggested and others are being developed.    These couldinvolve tax rebates, additional grants, guarantees or a mixture of allthese.    All these schemes require to be worked out in detail beforeMinisters can consider them.    And I am now advised that it is too late towork out and include any complicated new scheme in the present FinanceBill.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL3, This leaves open the possibility of announcing the Governmentsintentions in very broad terms and putting flesh on them later in the year.But this course is risky.    Evan a very general statement at this stagewould commit us to taking some sort of action before we are sure we canworkout a viable scheme or schemes and, because of its imprecision, itmight not be very convincing.    I believe that the real choice lies betweenannouncing our regional package now, without any offsetting measures(other than our future approach to section 8 of the Industry Act 1972including the Selective Investment Scheme) or postponing a decision to theautumn while the other possibilities are examined.    It goes without sayingthat delay beyond the summer recess involves a cash penalty in savingsforgone.    The advice I have is that a three-months1 delay in announcingour new regional measures might result in the loss of  20- 30 million ofsavings in 1980-81 and some further loss perhaps on a smaller scale in thetwo succeeding financial years.    Even more important there is a seriousrisk that firms may postpone their investment decisions until ourannouncement.4. Against this background I would suggest that our discussion inCabinet should seek to answer the following questions:-a. Do we confirm that regional policy must make a substantialcontribution to the cuts in public expenditure we are seeking?Is the scale of the proposed cuts and their effect on industryacceptable?b. If so, do we accept the basic proposal (paragraph 2 of theAnnex) that the rate of Regional Development Grant (RDG) inDevelopment Areas (DAs) should be reduced, after 12 monthsnotice, from its present level of 20 per cent to 10 per cent? Ordo we prefer the Secretary of State for Wales&apos; proposal that therate of RDGs in these areas should be set at 15 per cent - with aconsequent reduction in savings based on the 1978 ExpenditureWhite Paper, after the necessary transitional period, of 60 million?    If account is taken of changed forecasts since the1978 Expenditure White Paper the net cost would be  30 million,assuming boundary changes are accepted as proposed.c. Do we accept that RDGs in intermediate areas should beabolished after 12 months noticefaft&amp;y-a Hnunjitiunal uuilud? .d. Do we accept that the Assisted Area map should be redrawnafter a transitional period of one to three years as proposed inparagraph 1 of the Annex with a consequential saving of  40 to  50 million a year and a reduction in the proportion of thepopulation residing in Assisted Areas from 40 to 25 per cent?Any map of Assisted Area boundaries gives rise to criticism anddifficulties which is one reason why the 1972 boundaries weredrawn generously, although experience since then suggests thatsuch generosity increases the resentment of those who remainexcluded.    The new map, while it represents a degree of2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALcompromise between Departments, is broadly based onobjective criteria.    Within it the most difficult problemidentified by the Secretary of State for Wales is th-3 status tobe accorded to the Merthyr, Pontypridd and Aberdare travel towork areas which are at present Special Development Areas (SDAs)but which, on the proposals, would become DAs.    The Secretaryof State also asks that largely rural parts of Dyfed, Gwynedd andPowys that are scheduled, on the proposals, to lose theirDevelopment Area status should become Intermediate rather thannon-Assisted Areas.    A strong political case can of course bemade to support these suggestions.    The problem however isthat there are many areas in England which have a strong claim,on objective criteria, to be treated on a par with these areas.Significant redrawing of the boundaries in Wales would thezeforebe likely to lead to substantial pressure for redrawing of theboundaries in the rest of Great Britain.e. Do we accept the transitional arrangements for the changesdescribed in paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Annex or do we introducethe major modification as suggested by the Secretary of State forWales, eg by ruling out downgrading of any Assisted Area by morethan one step on this occasion?    Such an outcome would be bitterlyresented in those parts of the present North West and YorkshireIntermediate Areas which are to be downgraded.f. Do we accept the proposed relaxation, though not the abolitionof the Industrial Development Certificate controls?g. Do we accept the other, relatively minor and so far as I amaware completely uncontentious, proposals in paragraphs 3, 5 and7 of the Annex on such matters as the administration of regionalselective assistance, the factory building programme and policytowards Inner Cities, New Towns and Local Authority powers toassist industry?h. Should the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies and theHighlands and Islands Development Board and the DevelopmentBoard for Rural Wales, continue to operate throughout theirpresent territories subject to such adjustments as are necessaryto provide for broadly comparable treatment to that to be given tothe English non-Assisted Areas?    And should there be greaterattention to these institutions and, in England, by the DevelopmentCommission, and the Council for Small Industries in Rural Areas^COSIRA) to the ruraDpoworc of the new non-Assisted Areas?(Detailed study of any necessary adjustments can be made duringthe transitional period).3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALi.     Do we aim to define and announce our new policies before thesummer recess (bearing in mind that the approval of the EuropeanCommission is required;  because almost all the changes involvereductions in aid we hope to obtain the Commission^ reactions farmore quickly than is normally the case) or do we defer finaldecisions and announcements until the House reassembles in theautumn?j.    How can we improve the presentation of our new policy andare there any specific measures to assist industry which we shouldeither foreshadow or seek to decide before the regional announce-ment is made?K JDepartment of Industry3 July 19794CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALANNEXregional INDUSTRIAL POLICY : SUMMARY OF MAIN PROPOSALSchanges IN THE ASSISTED AREAS1 The present structure of the Assisted Areas (AAs) should bemaintained but the boundaries revised in accordance with Nap 2*(attached).    This has been drawn up on the basis of objective,defensible criteria and seeks to avoid the criticisms which havebeen made of the present AA boundaries.    The up grading shouldtake effect immediately.   The down gradings should take effectafter one year, but where an area is to be downgraded by morethan one step it should go down only one step after one year andonly move to the final grading after a further two years, andwhere an Intermediate Area (LA) is to become a non-Assisted Areathis should only be after 3 years not 1 year.regional DEVELOPMENT GRANTS2 Regional Development Grants (RDGs) should be abolished in theIAs;   the rate payable in the Development Areas (DAs) should bereduced from 20% to 10%;    and the minimum value requirement forindividual assets on which grant is paid should be increased from 1,000 to  5,000 for buildings or works and from  100 to  500 formachinery or plant.   The last change should take effect immediately;the first two after one year, in order to delay the impact onindustry&apos;s cash flow and profitability.Footnote: A few small amendments to Map 2 are necessary:^esteg EOA in the Port Talbot TTWA should be shown as a DA:gavenhy EOA in the Pontypool TTWA should continue as a mixedlA- (rather than becoming a DA throughout) ;    and the whole ofDundee TTVA should be shown as an SDA i.e including thatsouth of the Eirth of Tay.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2REGIONAL SELECTIVE ASSISTANCE3 The operating guidelines for regional selective assistanceshould be tightened to make such assistance more cost effective.INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT CERTIFICATES4 Industrial Development Certificates should be abolished inthe IAs and the exempting limit in the non-Assisted Areas shouldbe raised to 30,000 square feet.FACTORY BUILDING5 The objective should be to secure as near as.,possible a self-financing factory building and management operation by 1983/84.OTHER AGENCIES &amp; POLICIES6 Ministers should take steps to ensure in due course, in thelight of the decision on AA boundaries, that the operations of tScottish and Welsh Development Agencies outside the AAs would bebroadly equivalent to those of comparable English institutions,notably the NEB, Development Commission and COSIRA.7 Account should also be taken by the Ministers concerned of tbchanges in regional industrial policy, including the revision ofthe AAs, in their review of policies towards inner cities, NewTowns and local authority powers to assist industry.NORTHERN IRELAND8 Because of its special circumstances Northern Ireland&apos;s intiuspolicies should continue to be treated separately, though decisireached for Great Britain will need to be taken into accountTIMING OF ANNOUNCEMENT9 The changes in regional assistance to industry and the aaboundaries should be announced and the necessary Order made befojthe beginning of the Summer Recess, in order to minimise the Veof uncertainty for industrial investors./10CONFIDENTIALric
