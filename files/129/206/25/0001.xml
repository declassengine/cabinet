SECRETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE, 1980-81 TO 1985-84INTRODUCTION TO REPORT ON THE SCOPE FOR REDUCTIONSIntroductionAt Cabinet on 24 May, officials were asked to report on:(a) the public expenditure plans inherited from theprevious Government;(b) the scope for reductions.A separate report, &quot;The Inherited Plans&quot;,    available to Ministersin their Departments,   deals with (a).   This report deals with (b).factual and analytical2. These two reports present the/material on the basis of whichMinisters will now determine the changes which they wish to makein the plans inherited from their predecessors.   The survey coversa five-year period.   Decisions for 1979-80 have already been takenand announced in the Budget.   Decisions taken in this survey for1980-81 will be used in due course as the basis for cashlimits, Parliamentary Estimates and the Rate Support Grant forthat year. Decisions for the later years, 1981-82 to 1983-84,will be more provisional.3. This report covers about   98%   of public expenditure, andcomprises contributions from most major spending Departments.Those excluded are Departments whose expenditure is almost entirelyon civil service pay: they are mostly very small and will becovered in the Civil Service Department (CSD) report on the recentdecision by Ministers to seek cuts in civil service costs. TheCSD report will also cover the civil service pay and related costsof the Departments contributing to this report: where options forreductions (or additional bids) are presented in this report whichwould affect such costs, account will be taken of that fact inthe CSD report.A separate report to Ministers deals with the financingrequirements of the nationalised industries.    Sales of assets arealso the subject of a separate Ministerial exercise.
Options for reductionsincluded5-     The options for reductions/in this report are presented inaccordance with the Cabinet decision.   Except in the defence, lawand order and health programmes, officials were asked to identifyoptions for each Department amounting to its share of the cutsidentified in Opposition, or (if greater) 7?% of its programmes(or share of programmes) in 1980-81, as in Cmnd 74-39, 12-J% in1981-82 and 174% in 1982-83; and options in 1983-84 not less thanthose for 1982-83.6. In the defence and law and order programmes, officials wereasked to effect the maximum economy in the use of resources beforeformulating proposals for increases in expenditure.    In the healthservice, officials were asked to identify the maximum cuts withinthe Manifesto commitment.7. Table 1 summarises the contents of the Departmental contri-butions to this report.   The identified options for reductionsare shown in line 10 (and listed in Table 2.).    They include decreasesresulting in later years from the Governments decisions in respectof 1979-80 (eg Budget cuts and cash limits squeeze) and reducedrequirements (some resulting from the changes in economic assump-tions since Cmnd 74-39 - see next paragraph).Economic assumptions8. The economic assumptions underlying the figures in thisreport are. listed at AnnexD .   They are working assumptions,which take into account the Budget of 12 June.    They are differentfrom the assumptions underlying Cmnd 74-39, and hence estimatingchanges have been made in some programmes: these changes areincluded in the options for reductions (if negative) or theadditional bids (if positive).   The options for reductions, ifimplemented, could themselves affect these economic factors,especially unemployment, which would lead to further estimatingchanges.
SECRETLegislative requirements9. Many of the changes proposed would require legislation. Annexa lists these options and indicates those requiring legislationin the present session, for which the legislative programme isalready crowded.Additional bids10. Line 11 of table 1 summarises the additional bids presentedby Departments, which are listed in Table 3. .    They include esti-mating increases resulting from the change in economic assumptionssince Cmnd 74-39-Contingency reserve11. The Government have decided the size of the contingencyreserve for 1979-80.    The later-year figures shown in table 1 arethose in Cmnd 74-39.   Ministers will wish to decide the appropriatelevel.Shortfall12. Shortfall in 1977-78 was nearly  5bn compared with previousplans, and in 1978-79 the latest estimates suggest that it wasabout  2-g-bn.   But in 1979-80 it is expected to be lower, becausethe Budget cuts and cash limits squeeze are expected to absorbsome of the underspend which would otherwise occur.    Cuts of thesize shown in line 10 of table 1 would have a similar effect inthe later years.Debt interest13. Projections of debt interest, based on revised economic assump-tions following the Budget, are shown in line 12 of table 1.Local authority expenditureA separate analysis of the implications of the options forreductions for local authority expenditure is at Annex B,.Sgostruction15.   A separate analysis of the construction content of the optionsfor reductions and additional bids is at Annex 0..

SECRETNotesLines 1 and 2.   Exclude former adjustment in respect of childtax allowances.   BP share sale proceeds are added back in1977-78 ( 697 million).   Programmes presented in &quot;cash&quot; termshave been revalued again since report on &quot;The Inherited Plans&quot;,using post-Budget economic assumptions: see Annex D.Line 2.   Differs from line 1 by including announced changesmade by previous Government to Cmnd 74-39 plans: chief itemsin 1979-80 were reductions in Estimates (eg  185 million onemployment services and  50 million on agriculture) and switchof  200 million of export credit to Trustee Savings Banks.Line 3.   Includes all changes made by the Government affecting1979-80, except sales of assets which are shown in line 7, andsocial security changes shown in line 3A.Line 4-.   Separate report is being presented to Ministers onnationalised industries&apos; investment and financing review.Meanwhile no assumption made about level of reductions. Short-term borrowing and leasing is included, as recommended ininvestment and financing review.Line 5.   CSD will bring forward report in due course on thisexpenditure.   Meanwhile no assumption made about level ofreductions.Line 7.   Includes  J billion for 1979-80, because although aimis  1 billion not all sales may reduce public expenditure total(though they will reduce PSBR).   Figures for later years willemerge from separate review.8.   Includes post-Budget estimate of around  1 billion for1979-80.   For later years, shortfall would be similarly affectedby large cuts in expenditure (see paragraph 12 of introduction),and same figure as for 1979-80 is included.

The spending authorities are the MOD and the Property Services Agency.Ho legislation would be required, and the retail price index would be unaffected.He consequences for Civil Service manpower cannot be assessed at this stage.a) The Government have a political commitment, reaffirmed in the Queen&apos;sSpeech, to improve the security of the nation and strengthen our contributionto NATO.b) At the NATO Defence Planning Committee Meeting in May the Secretary 6f-State for Defence accepted the Alliance&apos;s call to aim for 3 per cent ayear real increase in defence spending to 1986.   This was not in itself abinding commitment, and was recognised as being subject to Ministers&apos;decisions on public expenditure.   But, taken with the Government&apos;s declaredintentions on defence, it reinforces the strong public and Alliance expectationthat the Government&apos;s spending plans, when announced, will include a 3 percent annual real increase in the defence budget.c) The last Government consistently failed to approve the defence budgets whichtheir own published projections had shown to be necessary at the time oftheir Defence Review (197^-75).   Since that date moreover the military threatto the Alliance has increased.(d) The inherited defence programme shows a substantial upswing in plannedspending on equipment for all three Services over the PESC period.   This isnecessary to finance a programme with a heavy production content, including&apos;j-he Tornado aircraft, the Navy&apos;s rolling programme of ASW cruisers, Type2 destroyers, Type 22 frigates and nuclear-powered submarines; and additional^ieftain tanks, Milan anti-tank missiles and Army air defence improvements.It was for this reason that Ministers increased the defence budget for 1979-80by  100 million.   The level of expenditure on equipment is planned to increaseby 25 per cent in real terms over the PESC period.
SECRtlSECRET(e) Over the same period the requirement for uniformed manpower increases Iby 7 per cent, compared with the current low starting-point reflectingshortages stemming from discontent with pay and conditions of service. ThBrestoration by the Government of pay levels comparable with outside employmentand the declared intention to retain this relationship, greatly improve theprospects of achieving the manning levels required, though continuingefforts to recruit and retain manpower will be needed.(f) Apart from their general insufficiency (see (c) above) the last GovernmentDefence Review budget projections have proved to be unrealistic in oneimportant respect. They assumed some downturn in funding requirements betfl1981-82 and 198^-84. In fact, as stated above, there will be a significanlfincrease in the cash required for equipment over this period.(g) Ministers have yet to take decisions on how the defence programme should;be enhanced.   Issues to be considered include nuclear capabilities; theremedying of weaknesses in the present force structure (including the direct]defences of the UK, and the improvements   called for by NATO through the ILong Term Defence Programme); and the nation&apos;s defence interests outside tflNATO area.   It is therefore premature to put forward a precise programme 1of costed improvements.   However, in the M0D&apos;s judgment the additional bids ;now made are the minimum necessary to provide Ministers with a small marginfor some enhancement of the capabilities, which would have been required Ito implement the policies inherited from the last Government.3. The Ministry of Defence will play a full part in the search for administrativeeconomies throughout Government.   This will yield financial savings which cannotyet be quantified; the Ministry have however taken account of these factors injframing the additional bids.   The Ministry point out that the scope for freshsavings has been diminished by past economies achieved since the formation ofunified Ministry in 1964, and latterly intensified as a result of budgetarycuts under the last Government; and that continuing commitments outside our naJdefence effort, such as those in Northern Ireland and Belize, give rise to coslwhich must equally be reflected in the additional bids.4. Treasury officials note that:(a) the  100 million already made available for 1979-80 is added to thebaseline on which    annual 3 per cent increases are built; that the excesgis similarly built into the subsequent calculations; and that the totalincrease in the four years 1980-81 to 1983-84 is 12.8 per cent;(b) in addition to the  100 million already approved, M0D&apos;s bids wouldrepresent an increase of some  488 million more* than would be requiredmeet the NATO target of 3 per cent annual increases on a 1978-79 baselinejthroughout the Survey period;(c) acceptance of these bids would mean that the proportion of total publiexpenditure devoted to defence would rise above the present 11 per cen ,the new figure would by 1983-84 be about 14 per cent if total publicexpenditure had by then been brought down to the 1977-78 outturn levei,accordance with the Government&apos;s aim; __ii.*NoteM0D&apos;s bidsIncreasesrequired toachieve strict3$ growth1980-8188-12Excess of i over ii. 1001981-823161901261982-835644351291983-84. 828695133Total17961308488SECRET
SECRETSECRETand that such an increase would make more difficult the achievement of this aim;(d) as a propotion of GDP, our defence expenditure on NATO definitions wouldrise from 4.95 per cent in 1979-80 to around 5-5 per cent by the end ofthe PESO period, a figure higher than those of any of our major NATOAllies at present.Treasury officials note that the MOD propose in due course to bring forward aprecise programme of costed improvements on which the additional resources nowsought would be spent, and also intend to find financial savings through a neweconomy drive (which in the Treasury view would need to include a due share of the cutsin the PSA works programme on which Ministers have decided).   They believe thatit would be appropriate to await these developments before entering into firmcommitments on defence expenditure beyond 1981-82.   They suggest that Ministersmight indeed wish to commission studies to check priorities within the defenceprogramme, ensure maximum defence value for money, and verify the requirementsfor additional expenditure.

Because commitments to multilateral expenditurettgenerally more inflexible than those on the bilateral side, reductions would fallrgely on the bilateral aid programmes including research, development, education andMing and other home-based technical co-operation.   To this extent, the reductionsconstrain our flexibility as a bilateral donor, and might have implications for! amount that could be spent on tied aid or our ability to respond to unforeseen needspolitically or strategically important developing countries.

These options will be considered in the context of the Lord President oftlle Council&apos;s manpower exercise.   A proportion of the manpower savings would be foundactoss the board in the FCO home-based functions, but post closures would carry the^rden.   Depending on the mix adopted, up to 110 posts would have to be closed.would automatically reduce the demand on the communications services.   If those&apos;6rvipeswere, however, to bear a full pro rata cut, the effects would go beyondsecnrit^d could entail material damage to the reliability of the remaining network, to? Protection and to the BBCs external broadcastings   This could only be avoidedadditlonal post closures or by even heavier cuts in other FCO programmes.
The options described in the following paragraphs would also involve some reductionin FCO manpower.Overseas Information:FCO information work could be cut by radically reducing the number and quality ofsponsored foreign visitors programmes as well as reducing expenditure on new inform-ation technology.   BBC external services cuts could be attained partly by theelimination of all vernacular transmissions except to Eastern Europe, China and theArabic service.   To these could be added various options for closing relay stations,reducing World Service broadcasts and reconsidering the recently approved expenditureto improve audibility.   British Council options would include closure of a largenumber of offices at home and overseas and a substantial reduction in activitieselsewhere.   A functional approach might involve a 25% reduction in the informationand cultural work which the Council does for the FCO.The Treasury suggest that an alternative option to those listed above would be tomake bigger savings in the lower priority work of the British Council; eg. arts tour^and exhibitions, student exchange visits, and libraries.    Some  20 million a yearmight be saved by cutting out this work (while maintaining existing expenditure oncultural relations with the Soviet Bloc and China).Other External Relations:Most of this programme comprises international subscriptions which cannot be cutwithout, in most cases, withdrawal from organisations such as the UN and OECD, renegon international commitments or, in some cases, legislation.   If the full weight ofthe cuts were to bear on the balance of the programme, this could only be achieved bfor example, a combination of withdrawal of our contribution to the UN Force in Cyprj(UNFICYP) and the abolition of all grants in aid (the major source of funds for theCommonwealth Institute, Marshall Aid scholars etc) but if the balance of the programmewere to be confined to a 17^ cut, this could be attained by such measures as reducijgrants in aid and cutting our involvement in the activities of the CommonwealthSecretariat and Western European Union.Military Assistance:To achieve the target cuts would mean putting into reverse the recently agreedaugmentation (to  6.5m in 1979/80) of our modest military assistance training progrfor developing countries.   The main sufferers would be India and Kenya.

The remainderwild have to be made up by additional sales of assets including forest land andplantations.   This would require primary legislation.   Some 370 posts would go, mostinvolving redundancy.ie above options assume a return to the 1977-78 PES provision (the target agreed iniposition for this expenditure).   However, a large part of the increase since 1977-78ls accounted for by an increase in the notional interest charge on the value ofPlantations.

In other cases action to produce a particular saving in1982-83 results in a different profile of reduction from that suggested.42 These options comprise net reductions since   Cmnd 7439 which have been includedin the baseline (line 2) together with certain other changes that have occurredsince the baseline was agreed.Regional Development GrantThe option is based on the assumption that:-(a) SDA rates of grant would remain unchanged(b) DA rates would be reduced to 10 per cent(c) IA rates would be reduced to nil(d) minimum qualifying expenditures would be increased to  500 and  5000 forplant and buildings respectively, and(e) there would be 12 months&apos; notice of change.No assumption is made about removing the recently announced 4-month moratorium.This moratorium pulls forward into earlier years some small amounts of the projectedsavings.   Since agreeing the RDG baseline investment intentions have been revisedand it is possible that further small savings might accrue in some years on thisaeeount.   Also, if there were some relatively limited geographical boundary changes,there could be additional modest savings to those shown.   Certain of the changesdescribed above would require a legislative procedure during the current sessionof Parliament (the Development Area change before the summer recess).   The staffsavings are estimated to be some 75 persons with the main effect from 1981-82onwards.Regional Selective AssistanceSavings rising to  15 million by 1983-84 are considered feasible for Great Britainas a whole, by tightening the criteria for assistance.   This can be achieved byadministrative action.   Some minor staff savings might be made.knd and Bui1d-inp;sThese options take no account of any disposals of land and buildings that mightoe made.   All funds are committed in 198O-81 and largely in 1981-82. Thedeductions, if implemented, would reduce the factory building programme but therewould be no significant staff savings.Sgggarofa and DeveloTi)meft$^ options relate partly to abandonment of the move of the Government Chemistto Cumbria and partly to general B &amp; D activities, with particular emphasis on*u*s in the UK contribution to the European Space Agency in the later years ofthe Survey.   Cancelling the Government Chemist&apos;s move to Cumbria would eliminatea Planned increase of some 75 staff over the two years 1982-83 and 19o3-W.
SECRET7. National Enterprise BoardThe NEB&apos;s commitments to BL and RR limit possible savings in the early yearsof the Survey.   The options take no account of disposals of existing holdingsand assume some limited NEB activities in respect of existing holdings, regionaland rescue cases.   No Departmental staff savings are envisaged.8. Selective Assistance for Individual IndustriesThe baseline includes provision for an extension of the Selective InvestmentScheme beyond 30 June.   Under the &quot;inherited1 programme an increase of  150million (cash) was intended although not the whole of this sum is included inthe Survey period.   This is essentially the only uncommitted element of thissub-programme.   The options allow for a modest increase in funds ( 15 millioncash) for the   Selective Investment Scheme to enable it tobe continued until30 June on tightened criteria and a further extension beyond that date ( 50million cash although not all of this is included in the Survey period).9. Reduction in the provision for Future Industrial SupportThis sub-programme is intended to meet future requirements for new activitiesand existing programme variations.   The option proposed allows the retentionof only modest funds to meet variations.10.      Abolition of the provision for Future Industrial SupportUnder this option all the available provision from the Future IndustrialSupport sub-programme would be eliminated.

They cannot be finalised until the scope for reducing staff numbersks been examined in the CSD&apos;s review and consultations with the MSC on the scope forreducing their programmes have been completed.Reduced requirements are described in the separate report on the inheritedprogrammes.The greater part ( 89m) of the reductions to expenditure in 1980-81 reflectsthe budget cuts in special employment measures which have previously been rolledforward on an annual basis.   The remaining  70m&apos;is a result of the budget cutsin MSC expenditure.Substantial savings would be made by not proceeding with the proposal for anew statutory scheme for short-time working compensation.A high proportion of HSC, ACAS and the Department&apos;s own expenditure is on staff,so savings will depend on reductions in staff numbers.   A saving of about  10raover the whole period would result from abandoning the proposed dispersal toMerseyside of HSE staff, but some of the staff related costs would be within thethe reductions included in the table.The effect of the budget cuts on the MSCs expenditure 1980-81 are included in2 above.   Continuing savings will result from a review of the MSCs programmes,a&amp;d details will be settled in consultation with the Commission.
In all cases the spending authority is a Central Government Department. Nolegislation would be required for any of the options.

Reductions on the scale asked for must clearly fall mainly onthe nuclear programme and on our programme of support for the coalindustry, which are the only two areas in which the Department ofEnergy has sizeable expenditure (totalling 75 per cent of baseline).Cuts of this order would have a major effect on the two principalsources of our energy supplies for the future at a time when pressureon energy supplies worldwide is becomming increasingly severe.2-  The consequences of the reductions for the individual elementsof our programmes include:-(i)   The present level of expenditure on our nuclearprogramme has already led to a significant postponementof the date at which a Commercial Demonstration FastReactor would be possible.   Cuts on the scale indicatedwould put development back still further and adverselyaffect our ability to pursue international co-operationin this field.(ii)   The cuts would also severely reduce work onfusion projects other than JET and would curtail work
on selected safety issues and on the handling ofradio-active substances.(iii) Reductions in the Departments non-nuclear R&amp;Dand energy conservation programmes would necessitatecurtailing work in important areas of R &amp; D (eg renewableenergy sources, international co-operation on coalutilisation) which would he most damaging in terms ofenergy policy and would be entirely contrary to theapproach presently regarded as essential by theinternational community and to which we are expectedto make a contribution.(iv) The reductions in the cost of the OSIRG schemewould call for modifications to the recent Ministerialdecision on the future of the scheme.   They will alsoinvolve going back on assurances given to the industrythat 9 months notice would be given of significantchanges in the scheme.3.

Additionally BNFL have asked for a further investment of  30m( 15m pa in 1980-81 and 1981-82) in the Company&apos;s equity in supportof the Tripartite Gas Centrigure project.4. If, as is likely, all the surplus oil held in the pipeline andstorage system is sold it will no longer be available to fund theprojected annual deficits on the system and additional funds (ofabout  15m over the period) will be required.5.

6. ROADS AND TRANSPORTCommentary1. The Department of Transport roads and transport programme nowstands  130m below the level in 1973-74, despite the fact that publicexpenditure as a whole rose by 13% over the period.    If cuts wereimposed on the scale contemplated, it would reduce the programme toonly 78% of the level at the end of the last Conservativeadministration.   Within the programme, expenditure on roads(construction and maintenance) has fallen by 35% since 1973-74while subsidies to bus and rail services and concessionary fareshave risen by 78%.    Major reductions in expenditure on subsidiesto transport services can only be achieved over a fairly lengthyperiod; otherwise the fare increases involved would lead to such aloss of traffic that public transport, particularly in rural areas,would collapse.   This means that, to achieve the required level ofreductions in the total programme, a heavy burden has to fall onthe already depleted road construction and improvement programme.Motorways and trunk roads (Central Government)2. The road construction programme would be reduced by a further15% from 1981/82 onwards.    On this basis schemes currently underconstruction could be continued and a limited number of new schemesof major industrial importance begun, but the majority of schemesin the forward programme would be delayed by from 3 to 6 yearsdepending on priority.    Maintenance expenditure on the existingnetwork will have to be increased (with offsetting savings elsewhere)in view of the deteriorating condition of the earlier motorways underincreased heavy traffic.    Loss of jobs would be about 3,500 in theconstruction industry itself and up to 2,000 elsewhere.    Taken withthe possible rundown in local road construction, activity in theroad construction industry might be reduced to about 40% of itslevel in 1973/74.Local Transport    (Local Authority)3. The proposed options show one pattern of reductions to achievethe required savings, but the actual pattern achieved would dependon decisions by the authorities and would not necessarily reflectthe proposed pattern.     By 1982/83 local road construction would bereduced by nearly 25% with loss of over 1,000 jobs in localauthorities and nearly 3,000 elsewhere.    These figures could be muchgreater, if, as is likely, authorities were to find more savingsfrom here instead of from subsidies,   Important links betweenfactories and the trunk road network would in any event be delayed.Koad maintenance would be postponed on a significant scale with lossof 3,000 jobs, and with the prospect of higher costs in later years.^    On public transport investment, expenditure on new buses would^ reduced by  10m by 1982/83 with repercussions for bus manufacturers,^d other expenditure would fall by  13m in that year. RevenueluPport for rail, bus and other local transport would be reduced byin 1982/83 leading to real fare increases of about 13% orffilleage cuts of about 9%.   These effects would be additional to thereal fare increases of about 3% per annum required anyway to coverjncreased costs.   The RPI effect by 1982/83 would be about 0.3%, andfocal fares would be more than doubled in money terms. Althoughthere is some room for savings on concessionary fares as a result01 the decision not to impose a national half-fare scheme, a slight
SECRET6. ROADS AND TRANSPORTreduction in the generosity of existing schemes would be necessaryto achieve the savings indicated, since the number of peoplequalifying is growing steadily.   Expenditure on transportadministration would fall steadily with the loss of over 4,000 jobs.5. The effect of the reductions on the local authority sectoris particularly severe in 1982/83, and authorities might not beprepared to take action to give effect to these reductions withoutspecific direction from Ministers.British Rail and NFC pensions6. The savings assume legislation, probably contentious, to repealthe present arrangements for government funding of BR and NFCpension schemes, and to substitute a form of notional funding forthose liabilities which are not likely to arise for many years. ThJlegislation is not yet planned in detail, but could be broughtforward within a few months.   The savings in public expenditure and IPSBR terms would not free an equivalent amount of real resources.British Rail - other7. Given the better trading opportunities offered by the Budgetand the limited reductions on passenger support grant proposed,major cuts in the network or in services should be avoided. Fareincreases of about 5% pa. in real terms on commuter services and 3%on inter-city would however be necessary.    The RPI effect would beabout 0.1% by 1982/83.   The price of an annual season ticket fromSurbiton, for example, would rise from  246 to about  380. Therewould be dangers that mounting public opposition would make thetarget difficult to reach, particularly in the later years.New Bus Grants8. The savings would be achieved by phasing out the grant morequickly than planned, either generally or in specified areas, startingin August 1980.    This could result in real fare increases of up to J10%   (RPI effect about 0.1%) or 7% mileage cuts.   The acceleratedwithdrawal of the grant would be fiercely resisted by operators andllocal authorities.Port investment9. To operate the rationing system necessary to effect areduction, the level at which the Minister&apos;s approval is requiredfor investment projects would have to be drastically reduced - byaffirmative resolution.   The rationing would inevitably be onavery arbitrary basis, would be resented by the ports and wouldincrease civil service costs, in addition to the damaging economeffects of the reductions themselves.Freight facilities grants10. At present the provision is sufficient to cover all the, f^pan16schemes which come forward.   The reduction of  3m a year would methe rejection of worthwhile schemes, and the opportunity to prom *mgreater use of rail for freight would be lost.Transport research11. Some trimming of government expenditure on less essential
SECRET 6. ROADS AND TRANSPORTactivities would be made.Administration12. It is assumed the savings will be identified in the presentCSD exercise.    In the event that these do not prove to bepossible corresponding cuts will be required in other services.Increases: Assistance to the Port of London Authority13. Pending decisions on the future of the PLA which couldinvolve additional expenditure, provision is made for continuingthe existing policy of assistance towards severance costs ofstaff.

Some additional provision is however required- to sustain the local authority improvement programme,essential to rescue substandard estates from irreversibledecline (though some offsetting savings may be availablefrom private sector improvement grants)- to redeem the Manifesto commitment to worthwhile reformsof the first time buyers scheme- to ease the supply of funds for downmarket lending atacceptable rates by some increase in the derisory provisionin Cmnd 7439 local authority mortgage lending- to provide for increased rent allowances and supplementarybenefit as a consequence of changes now agreed in the fairrent system.3. In 1980/81 and 1981/82 scale cuts could be achieved by anappropriate mix - to be determined by DOE Ministers - of the reductioand offsetting additional requirements noted above: reductions insubsidy could however be necessary in 1981/82 and would certainly berequired in later years.    These would require significant rent increaover and above those necessary to keep abreast of increases in earnin(as already assumed in Cmnd 7439).    If for example rents were torise by 10% more than earnings from 1981/82 onwards,PESC savings (netof additional requirements for rent rebates ) would ariseThese savings could complete the scale cuts but would, on presenteconomic assumptions, imply a cash increase in average unrebatedfrom the present level of  6.50 to some  12.60  by 1983/84.4.

SECRETB &quot;Opposition&quot; Cuts (PESC(79)18 Appendix C)5. The Opposition cuts amount to more than double the scale cuts&apos; The Department take the view thatthroughout the period. /Short of catastrophic reductions in thecapital programme they would be attainable (as indeed was evidentlyenvisaged) only by massive rent increases.    Rents would certainlyneed to reach well over 3 and possibly 4 times their present levelby 1983/84 (ie over  25 a week gross in cash terms) with 60% oftenants by then receiving rebates.    Specific powers would undoubtedlybe necessary to avoid major increases in rate fund contributions:and such patent discrimination against tenants would undoubtedly callin question the existing system of mortgage interest tax relief forhomeowners.TREASURY OBSERVATIONS6. The Treasury note that:(a)   The net amounts agreed by Ministers as the D0E&apos;s housingcontribution to the total of options for reductions were: M1980-81     1981-82     1982-83 1983-84-1144       -1573       -205 5 -2055(b) Implementation in full of the savings identified bythe Department in para 1 above, would save-694 -969 -1220 -1334(c) No savings are offered from increases in rents fasterthan earnings in 1980-81.    If Ministers are prepared,to commit themselves to implementation of the proposednew subsidy system in 1980-81 and a consequent increaseof rents by  1 a week above earnings, (as agreed inOpposition), this would save about  200 million in 1980-81,net of increases in rebates for low income tenants. Grossrents at some  8.50 a week or about 7-J% of averageearnings would still be more than  1 a week in real termsbelow the ir 1973-74 level.    Raising rents by  1 a weekabove earnings throughout the period might  save (overand above the savings identified in para 3 above)-200 -300 -400 -470/(d)
(d)   Para 1 implies than land acquisition will be permittedto rise above the 1978-79 level despite the greatlyreduced building programme and existing local authority-land holdings which the Department estimates assufficient for 320,000 dwellings.    If provision werereduced by  120 million a year, to the 1978-79 level,there would be further savings of1980-81-421981-82-421982-83-601983-84-80(e)   No quantified reductions for realism have been identified]in e.g. Option Mortgage Subsidy (OMS), as a result ofreductions in the basic rate of tax, and private sectorimprovement grants and the First Time Purchasers scheme,as a result of slow take up.    Such adjustments mightsave:-130        -150 -150 -1507.   The Treasury further note that para 2 above   implies substantisadditional expenditure on policies to which the Government has noimmediate Manifesto commitment.    If this expenditure were postponed!or forgone, increases of up to the following would be avoided:300296260374and the measures outlined in para 6 b-e above would provide thefollowing savings- 1066       -1461 -1830 -203^leaving to be found to meet the target in paragraph 6a:78 112 225218.   In the light of these considerations, the Treasury considerthat the level of expenditure reductions agreed in Opposition isachievable in 1980-81.    The extra  78 million of savings requiredmight be sought by adjustments in the housing association and newtown programmes - totalling  675 million - and/or by furtherreductions in the OMS rate.   To the extent that additional provisiqwere made, for example, for increases rent allowances, compensatingoffsets might also be sought in these areas.    In future yearsit should be possible in principle to make the reductions agreedin Opposition, though the measures would require further examinatijA&quot; -51also

For the purpose of thisexercise the exempt services are taken to include police, prisons, courts,probation and after-care (which constitute about 80 per cent of the expenditureon the programme and are closely inter-related: increased effort by the policeaffects the other services), immigration, civil defence and central administration.Options for reductions have therefore only been applied to expenditure on thefire service, community services and registration of electors.   An additional0Ption reduction on prison building has been included as the Home Office share&quot;f option cuts applied to PSA identified by the Government when in opposition.Ihis however must be balanced by an additional bid to enable work alreadyMmmenced to continue.   The cuts on the fire service (where the shorter working weekbeing introduced) could only be achieved by substantial manpower reductions,&apos;ter than the natural rate of wastage, and by an unacceptable cut in the levelfire cover.   Local authorities would face industrial relations difficulties.
HOME OFFICEIncreased risks and losses from fire damage could be expected.   The Treasuryand the Home Office consider that such cuts in the fire service are not Kaiu-As...A greater than proportionate share of the cuts ( 8 million in 1980-81 risingto  16 million in 1982-83) in community services could be achieved but onlyas a result of a decision not to proceed with the extension of expenditureconsequent on grants for ethnic minorities; abolition of the Equal OpportunitiesCommission (legislation would be required) and other savings resulting fromeg pruning the cost of the Commission for Racial Equality or from elsewherein the community services field.   The Home Office do not consider these optionsfeasible, although there could be some pruning of the cost of these bodies.On registration of electors, legislation to amend the requirement to producean annual register of electors would be required to enable the option forprogramme 13 to be put into effect.   The option reduction subsume savingsof about  2 million a year that would follow from the reductions in manpowerbeing sought in 1979-80.

The Treasury/CSD consider that until the May Inquiry has reported thereshould be no substantial additional provision for the prison service, thoughthey recognise that if the Inquiry&apos;s recommendations cannot be implemented intime decisions will have to be taken about provision in I98O-8I with consequential^for later years.   Total provision will have to be reviewed in the light of theInquiry&apos;s findings.   They also question whether, in the light of constraintson local authority expenditure and notwithstanding the announced priority forlaw and order, individual police authorities will be prepared to increaseprovision for civilian support cadets and equipment to the extent envisaged.This also affects the bid for capital (where, in particular, the bid includes 6 million for a site to replace Cannon Row even though PSA have no provisionfor redevelopment of the Palace   Chambers site) and for some central supportservices.   They also consider that the planned growth in probation officersmay reinforce criticisms that the service is already under-employed. Proposalsfor increased expenditure on civil service   wages and salaries (ie prison staffcentral support services for the police and immigration - staff) will need to beviewed against the options for cuts - in the cost of the civil service whichMinisters &apos;. will be considering separately.^3

SECRETCommentary on optionsSchools1. This would exclude some 250,000 young children from (mainly part-time)schooling.   It would cause hardship for one-parent families and families withmothers at work.   Physical accommodation in nursery and primary schools would lieidle.   Many of the 10,000 fewer teachers would be made redundant. Alternativelycharging could be introduced to alleviate these effects.-2. This would imply charges or a severe curtailment of the scope of the service.It would cause hardship for children and families particularly in rural areaswhere parents have pressed for a reduction in the statutory walking distances.There might well be a reduction in school attendance.3. This would limit the provision of the conventional school meal to certainareas or categories of pupils; or it would mean the introduction in all schoolsof a limited choice snack system.   Many of the 300,000 staff (mainly part-time)would become redundant, and the use of midday supervisors would have to bereviewed.On average, over 2000 surplus school places per constituency (includingperhaps 3 or 4 complete schools) would be closed.   In addition:-a. As pupil numbers fall there will be diseconomies of scaleand an increase in unit costs is needed to maintain standards.As teacher numbers fall the average teacher will become more seniorand his salary will rise.   The option   with over 50,000 fewerteachers than planned in 1983-84 (about 85OOO fewer than at present)would lead to redundancies.   It would mean larger classes, a reductionin the quality of the curriculum in primary and secondary schools,increases in the shortage of specialist teachers of mathematics, scienceand technology, and     . a further increase in mixed-age classes inprimary schools where standards are on average lower.expand    in-service training,fab. The option would involve abandoning plans &quot;to/improve the qualityof teaching, particularly in language and mathematics skills, andto provide induction support for new teachers.SECRET67
c.      There would be a further deterioration of buildings throughinadequate repairs and maintenance, and redundancies of non-teachingstaff.   Provision for books and equipment, already at an unsatisfactorylevel, would be cut back still further.5. A recent assessment of Her Majesty&apos;s Inspectorate has highlighted the presenpoor condition and unsuitability of many school buildings. Eliminatingimprovements would preserve this situation.Schools and further education6. This would be seen as &quot;turning the clock back&quot; to 19^5 when tuition fees inmaintained secondary schools were abolished.   They are not charged for 16-18 yearolds in further education to maintain parity of treatment with schools.   There wobe a sharp contraction in the numbers remaining in full-time education after 16and a restriction of educational opportunities even with a means test.   The Treasugis very doubtful about the feasibility of this option and would regard furthergeneral cuts in standards as somewhat less unrealistic.Higher and further education7. This would mean holding the numbers of students in universities (including tOpen University) and polytechnics at or below their present level at a time whenthe numbers in the relevant age-group are still increasing.   The proportion of18 year old age-group entering higher education, already low in comparison withindustrialised countries,would fall.   There would be a brake on all new appointingand no opportunity to appoint young teachers and research workers thus reducingthe quality of scholarship and learning.8. This represents a reduction in volume terms of some IkK) in non-advancedfurther education (excluding adult education), leading to a contraction ofvocational education in all areas.   Opportunities for both school leavers andthose already at work to take courses with a view to employment or re-employmentwould be curtailed and the supply of skilled manpower especially at technicianlevel would be at risk.9. Part of this reflects the lower number of places needed in non-advancedfurther education if Option 8 is implemented.   In higher education a reducedprogramme would hold up plans in universities and polytechnics to provide fora more effective use of buildings.
SECRETFees for overseas students, increased by over 30$ this year^would be more,doubled.   There would be strong reactions from student and race relationsodies in this country, and heavy criticism from overseas governments, andspecially from the EEC, differential fees being contrary to agreed EEC policy,ther the cost of bursaries offered by the FCO would increase or their numberssold have to be reduced.1, This would mean the elimination of the minimum maintenance payment of  3000 all award holders (which is actually compensation for the withdrawal of Childa Allowance), charges for fees (up to about  700) and a general increase in the parentalontribution of  70 in addition.   For some parents this would mean increasedenditure of over  1000 annually.1 Facilities for 14-18 year olds in youth service, much of it run by voluntaryrganisations, would be sharply cut at a time when numbers in these age-groupse still rising.)&apos; Evening classes (at present providing for 2 million adults) would disappearmany areas - elsewhere charges would be doubled or trebled.section and administrationThis would bring a cut in the number of inspectors and advisory staff attine when the number is already inadequate to check standards.ffiNCEThis cut (however it is applied) would do serious permanent damage to anssential activity in which Britain has the highest international standing,ftticmal Bid: AdditionPION  million 1979 Survey prices1980-81   1981-82   1982-83 1983-84 lsted Place scheme      up to405555!*nifesto stated that &quot;the Direct Grant principle will therefore be restored withlisted Places Scheme.

The remaining national companieswould have severely to curtail their touring programmes.Option 4There would be a complete stop to new building and other developmentboth in London and outside, much of which is intended to put on showobjects not at present on view; and there would be great difficulty inMaintaining the structure of existing buildings.national museums and galleries, in order to minimise reductions
SEofiETin opening times, might have to stop all, or nearly all, newacquistions, including those made for the protection of thenational heritage. Substantial closures of sections of museumscould hardly be avoided, with greatly reduced access both for thegeneral public and specialist students^ without additional riskto the security of some collections.Option 6The Housing of the Arts fund assists construction projects in thearts. Zt is already committed 3 years ahead. These reductionswould involve cancellation or deferment of commitments and ofmuch work in progress.Option 7Local public libraries would suffer substantial reductions inopening hours and many branch libraries would have to be shut.Sooks^purchases are likely to be particularly hard hit and thiswould/permanent damage^the effectiveness and attractiveness ofthe public library system.Option 8Many local authorities already neglect their museums.

For example, besides reducing the upratings topees only, it would be necessary to have no uprating at all until November 1982, byMen time the real value of the retirement pension will have been cut by over  4. InJrder to achieve the required reduction in 1980-81 it will also be necessary to make aMporary cut in a benefit, eg  1 reduction in child benefit for one year from AprilAlternatively upratings could be at half the increase in prices with the balancefrom reductions in CB.

The Social Security Act 1979 provides for affirmative orders^sing out the retirement pensioners&apos; earnings rule by reducing the age at which a&quot;son is deemed to have retired, currently 70 for a man and 65 for a woman. The^ings rule would then apply only between pensionable age and the new deemed retire-* age.   (Alternatively the rule could be uprated faster than earnings so as toe it out over 4 years.)

Three issues were referred by the previous Government to independent advisorybodies and the Government will have to decide how to react to their reports whenreceived.

The National Insurance Advisory Committee will report later this year on theincapacity for household duties test involved in the award of housewives&apos; non-contributory invalidity pension (HNCLP).   Cost  30m to  60m.ii. The same Committee will also report probably in late 1979, on the possibleextension of invalid care allowance to categories of non-relativeso   Cost not morethan  2m.iii. The Industrial Injuries Advisory Committee is likely to report in 1980 onwhether occupational asthmas should become prescribed illnesses.   Cost about  10m.Supplementary Benefit/industrial Injuries7. Both schemes have recently been reviewed.,   A nil cost package of supplementary!benefit changes is currently being considered with a view to legislation this se6.Consultations have yet to be held with interested bodies on the industrial injurychanges but a similar nil cost package can reasonably be expected.

The bulk of the expenditure1 each year is in respect of the continuing payment of pensions awarded to peoplellohave retired in the past and any change in the basis of calculation for staffparing in future would produce only the smallest savings in the Survey period.a change would also mean that the Civil Service scheme would no longer meet theMmum standards fdr contracting-out under the Social Security Pensions Act 1975.lurly, therefore, any significant change in the level of expenditure on Civilbice pensions would require major retrospective legislation and is not a viable3&apos;ion.  The programme includes  152.5 million in 1979-80 rising to  169.0 millionb 1982-83 in respect of theUump sum benefits payable to civil servants at thein of retirement or resignation and to their personal representatives if they dieService.   This benefit is not essential for contracting-out purposes but it doesJpresent about a quarter of the aggregate benefits of individual civil servants anda cost of it has been taken into account in determining their pay. RetrospectiveIllation would be required to take the benefit away from existing staff in respectI their past service.   A change for future service only would not produce substantialt^ngs in this programme in the Survey period but it would lead to pressure for aNegotiation of the pay settlement and an immediate increase in-Civil Service pay.In this programme, pensions already in payment are assumed to continue at the&quot;els to which they were increased on 1 December 1978 and new pensions and lump* for people retiring in the Survey years are based on current salaries. These&quot;rtant price figures would not therefore be reduced if either pay or pensions&apos;w to be increased in future by something less than the percentage increase in&quot;Ce8t   (The conventions governing the presentation of public service pensions arefsntly being reviewed by officials).

A decision to amend the inflation-Wing arrangements would therefore affect a wide field.   Moreover, the existencew pensions increase arrangements has been taken into account in determiningI   Service pay and the recent pay agreement would, once again, come into question.0Ptiono for reductions identified in the table are therefore limited to estimating*ges.i nalbidsI^avoidable net addition of  32.1 million in 1983-84 is described in the separatereport.

To do so would require legislation.   The mainsource of central government influence is through the Rate SupportGrant which is fixed in November.

SECRETI General Assessment5,    The reductions put forward on current expenditure are broadly inline with the percentages applied to programmes generally, allowingfor the exemption of expenditure on certain Home Office services.Substantially greater reductions are however put forward on localauthority capital programmes.    They are particularly large in 1980-81A large proportion, of the capital expenditure reductions areon housing.   Education contributes a little over half the totalreductions put forward on current expenditure; this is broadly equivalentto its overall share.Achievement of reductions on the scale proposed will requirespecific policy changes and, as necessary, legislative measures toenable local authorities to implement them.    Central government&apos;swillingness to change statutory requirements will be important, bothas a source of savings and as a touchstone to persuade local authoritiesto make other savings.   General pressure can be exerted throughstringency in the provision of central government finance through thej.   Wider changes to the legislative framework governing thefinancial controls over local authorities would also need to beconsidered.iitional BidsTables 3 and 4- below set out the additional bids put forward forlocal authority current and capital expenditure respectively.J4BLE 5Iqditional BIDS.

SECRETANNEX CHJBLIC EXPENDITURE ON CONSTRUCTIONPublic expenditure on construction accounts for nearly half (46 per cent in 1977)of the construction industry&apos;s output.   The proportion varies, however, betweendifferent sectors of the industry, and is twice as high (90 per cent) in the caseof particular concern to the industry. The industry is also important to the publicsector, since nearly all (about 90 per cent) of public sector fixed investment , andover half of total public capital expenditure, is on construction work.2. Table 1 shows construction output since 197^-75-   Total output,, which had peakedin 1972-73, fell in successive years to 1976-77.   Output recovered slightly in 1977-78and more strongly in 1978-79.   Despite this recovery estimated output in 1978-79was about 10 per cent below that achieved in 1972-73.   The recovery in output since1976-77 is due to increased work for the private sector.   In contrast constructionoutput for the public sector fell in 1977-78, and the recovery in 1978-79 was onlyto the 1976-77 level.   On the inherited plans, output for the public sector isexpected to fall slowly in the period to 1983-84.   Forecast output for the privatesector in 1979-80 is similar to that in 1978-79 but thereafter it is expected todrop due to reduced private investment.   As a consequence total output of theconstruction industry falls over the survey period reaching a trough in 1982-83&quot;hen output is expected to be 5 per cent below the level reached in 1978-79.3- Table 2 gives a broad functional analysis of the construction content of theinherited plans, which updates the construction table (5-2. ) in Cmnd 7439- Itdiffers from the public sector component of table 1 in that it relates to theinstruction component of capital expenditure and does not include repair andmaintenance work: for many programmes expenditure in the latter category cannotbe identified.   The path of expenditure shown by the figures therefore corresponds&quot;^e to &apos;total new public work&apos; than to &apos;total new work&apos; in table 1, though thePrice basis of table 1 relates to the national accounts and that of table 2 to thesurvey.   There is also a divergence in 1979-80 which reflects the fact that table 1^lows for shortfall and the effect of the Budget measures, whereas table 2 (whichof civil engineering.   The level and composition of public expenditure is thereforeRecent development and prospects
SE6RETdeals with the inherited plans) does not.   Nevertheless both tables show the same Ibroad picture of a small gradual decline in public sector demand on the industryfrom 1980-81.Options for reductions and additional bids4. Table 3 picks out options for reductions and additional bids with a significant(ie in excess of  5 million in any one year) construction content for thoseDepartments whose total bids and options imply significant (ie in excess of  15 millionin any one year) changes in construction expenditure.   Up to two thirds of the impacton the construction industry of the options for reductions is accounted for by localauthority new housebuilding.   The Treasury point out, however, that the level of localauthority new housebuilding implied by the inherited plans was unlikely to be achieved,especially in the early years.   Moreover, the option reduction in public sectorhousebuilding implies a switch to private sector housebuilding.   On both counts tlfigures for new housebuilding in table 3 overstate the impact of this option on tconstruction industry.5. After housing, the biggest impact is on the roads and transport programme, wljthe construction content of the options rises to more than  150 million. (Thisincludes Welsh but not Scottish expenditure, because the allocation of the option jreductions to Scottish programmes has not been determined at this stage.) Othersubstantial impacts arise on the Property Services Agency, educational building, andthe Regional Water Authorities.6.     The impact of the identified additional bids is relatively very small and ismainly accounted for by police and court building and by drainage.   The figures f(jthe Thames Tidal Scheme, including the reduction in 1983-84 reflect changes in thetiming of the project.   However, there is a major bid for additional defence expendi-ture, rising to over  800 million in 1983-84.   This may well imply some additionalconstruction expenditure, but the Ministry of Defence are not yet able to indicate^the precise way in which the additional resources would be applied, so that theconstruction component cannot yet be identified.
