SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTC(79) 30 COPY NO 8017 July 1979CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND ECONOMIC STRATEGYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer1. My earlier memorandum (C(79) 27) drew particular attention to theserious budget problem facing us in 1980-81.    It showed that even with cuts of 6j billion in the inherited expenditure plans the public sector borrowingrequirement (PSBR) is projected to rise to around  9 billion.    There would beno room for any real reductions in taxes; and, to contain the growth cf moneysupply - which is the central feature of any policy to get inflation undercontrol - interest rates would remain high.2. There are, of course, wide margins of error around such projections.But the projection is constructed as a central one and it is therefore as likelythat it will prove to be too low as that it will prove to be too high.    It would bemost unwise to proceed now upon the hope that the PSBR will in the event turnout to be lower than the present projections suggest.    Indeed, there are somedisquieting signs (for example the worsened outlook for world trade followingthe oil price increase) pointing to a higher outcome.3. I was asked at last week&apos;s Cabinet to outline the consequences offailing to achieve the  6^ billion cut in the inherited plans.    The answerclearly depends on the actual extent to which the cuts fall short ofZb\ billion.    But the budgetary prospect for 1980-81 is already tight. Asignificant reduction in those cuts would risk forcing us to abandon one ormore of our other policy objectives, with all the unpalatable consequences.If we allow the PSBR significantly to exceed  9 billion the growth of moneysupply could not be held down without considerably higher interest rates.These we must avoid.    Indeed, we need to create conditions in which interestrates can come down from their present levels.    We certainly shall not dothat if we are seen to be weakening in our determination to reduce publicexpenditure.4. A reduction of  67 billion in the inherited plans would imply a declinecf about  lj billion from this year&apos;s expected total. This would represent avolume reduction of about 2 per cent between the two years.    Given the poor1SECRET
SECRETprospects for economic growth and the sharp increase in the relative cost of !public expenditure that is expected to result from comparability awards, avolume reduction of this order is required to prevent public expenditure risingas a proportion of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).i5. To illustrate some of these consequences more specifically theTreasury have made projections for 1980-81 with assumed expenditure cuts ofonly about half those envisaged in the Chief Secretary, Treasury1 s paperC(79) 26.    These projections show, as one would expect, some temporaryimprovement in output and employment, but at the cost of higher inflation andan intolerable budgetary and monetary prospect.    The ratio of publicexpenditure to GDP would be one point higher at 43 per cent.    The PSBRwould be around  12 billion, and money supply would be accelerating. Toavoid this outcome, which would entail holding the PSBR to around the 9 billion shown in my earlier paper, would require substantial tax increases.Since the projections already assume that the specific duties will be increasedin the 1980 Budget in line with retail prices, the scope for further raisingindirect taxes is severely limited.    But if the whole adjustment had to be madeon income tax it would imply an increase equivalent to around 5p on the basicrate.6. None of us could contemplate tax increases of anything approachingthis size.    We would be faced with having to modify our financial objectivesand depart from the announced strategy of progressively reducing the PSBRand the growth of money supply.    This would be a very serious move indeed.The financial markets, with good reason, see public expenditure cuts as thekey to a progressive reduction in money supply growth.    They are expectinga reduction in the volume of expenditure and the PSBR next year and theeffect of announcing an increase - both in absolute terms and as a percentageof GDP - would b* highly damaging to confidence.    It would almost certainlycause interest rates to rise sharply.7. In these circumstances the relief to output and employment arisingfrom smaller expenditure cuts would be very short-lived, and purchased atthe expense of output and employment in later years.    We embarked in theBudget on a strategy aimed at restoring a better balance in the economy evenif it implied a difficult path in the shorter term.    It is imperative not to bedriven off that strategy after such a short time by failing to take the publicexpenditure decisions necessary to make our fiscal policies match the restof our strategy.    This is precisely where the previous Government fell downand we committed ourselves to the task of reversing their failures.    If weare seen to falter now the whole credibility of the Government will be calledin question; and the result will be that the transitional problems of fallingoutput and employment will be extended, and the prospects for inflation mademuch worse.G HTreasury Chambers17 July 19792SECRET
