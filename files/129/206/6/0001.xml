5vCONFIDENTIALUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 6COPY NO 7615 May 1979 - &quot;CABINETTHE WAY FORWARD ON PAYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment1. Nearly half of all employees, in both the private sector and thepublic sector are due for settlements between now and the end of July.The average level of settlements was rising under the previous Administra-tion and is currently, in the private sector as in the public sector, around13 per cent, to which must be added around 2 per cent &quot;drift&quot;.    It wouldobviously be very damaging to competitiveness, investment and employmentif the level of settlements rose much above that figure for the rest of thisround or failed to be reduced substantially in the new round of settlementsbeginning in the autumn.2. Our policy is to encourage responsible pay bargaining, broadly byrequiring negotiators to face up to the consequences for competitiveness,investment and jobs of the agreements they make.    A firm monetary andfiscal policy provides the essential framework, reinforced in the publiccorporations and the public services by adherence to strict cash limits.3. Monetary policies will not of themselves, however, necessarilyprevent unions in powerful negotiating positions - as very many are -short-sightedly pursuing excessive claims with insufficient regard toemployment consequences.    Simply to let these consequences flow, for theirlong-term educational effect, could involve serious damage to competitive-ness, investment and job6 from which it would take some time to recover.It is essential to develop &quot;enlightened self-interest&quot; before not after, sucha sequence of events.4. Several policies have a part to play in this educational process:-a. Industrial policy:  a tougher but reasonable line on &quot;lameducks&quot; can have an exemplary effect without endangering the wholeeconomy.b. Industrial relations policy:  reasonable action to redressthe balance on the lines we propose has a contribution to make,but is not a panacea.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. Taxation policy:  particularly reward for effort and success.d. Cash limits in the public sector:  must be realistic if they areto be firm, and can affect investment or the level of service ratherthan pay.5. Other important ingredients will include: -a. The improvement of collective bargaining procedures; alongthe lines advocated by the Confederation of British Industry (OBI)and others, with the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Serviceplaying a constructive role.b. Development of competition policy:  particularly to ensurethat monopolistic enterprises, whether in the public or the privatesector, are not in a position to finance, by raising prices, highpay settlements reached to buy industrial peace without regard torepercussive effects on other enterprises;  we are bedevilled bythe problem that what one group gets, another expects - egelectricity workers whose pay is a relatively small element intotal costs can set the pattern for postal workers whose work isvery labour intensive.c. Disciplined comparability as a basis for pay negotiations in thepublic services:  not necessarily to the exclusion of other factors,but essentially conducted through a unitary system rather than aseries of leap-frogging ad hoc enquiries;  the Standing Commissionon Pay Comparability provides a basis for the development of this;cut backs in public expenditure and civil service manpower will beless provocative if there is a commitment to maintaining the payresearch system and fair comparisons.6. However, none of these policies, singly or together, can induceresponsible pay bargaining without wide public understanding and acceptanceof the Governments economic objectives.    This is not just a matter ofdiscussions at top level with the CBI and the Trades Union Congress (TUC),important as these are.    It must also be carried through at all levels ofindustry - where management have a leading role to play - and by directappeal through the media and their economic commentators to individualemployees and those who represent them at shop floor level.7. I therefore recommend:-a.      Early talks (before the Budget) with the CBI and the TUC(separately, at least initially) on objectives, capitalising so faras possible on the TUCs acceptance in the Joint Statement withthe previous Administration, that inflation needed to be curbedand that this required responsible pay bargaining.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALb. Taking every opportunity to present our case to the country -to demonstrate our commitment to an informed, open debate anddevelopment of the economic forum approach.c. A first priority in all these talks would be to avoid escalationof the level of settlements for the remainder of this round, pendingclarification of objectives for the future.d. The fixing of reasonable monetary targets and cash limits,which can be realistically maintained;  this means some departurefrom current cash limits for 1979-80.e. Continuation of Pay Research for the non-industrial andindustrial Civil Service, of Review Bodies, and of the StandingCommission on Pay Comparability at least for the time being;consultations with the unions on how the results are to bereconciled with cash limits in line with our Manifesto commitments.f. Sponsor Departments to maintain close liaison with publiccorporations on pay negotiations to ensure I. no abuse of monopolypositions where they exist;  ii. proper consideration of repercussiveeffects (pending development of a more effective &quot;public employers&apos;club&apos;).g. The Department of Employment to oontinue informalmonitoring of private sector settlements on its traditional voluntarybasis and to co-ordinate periodic information reports to Ministerson the pay situation generally.J Pepartment of Employment5 May 19793CONFIDENTIAL
