CONFIDENTIALhUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79) 1429 May 1979COPY NO76CABINETSOCIAL SECURITY UPRATINGSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social ServicesINTRODUCTION1. In approving my proposals for this year&apos;s uprating of socialsecurity benefits, colleagues asked me to consider further two points(CC(79) 3rd Conclusions).    These are dealt with below;  I seek approvalfor going ahead without the changes discussed.RESTRICTION TO LONG-TERM BENEFICIARIES OF TAKING ACCOUNTOF THE &quot;SHORTFALL&quot; IN LAST YEAR*S UPRATING2. It was agreed that the November uprating should correct, fromNovember 1979, the 1.9 per cent underestimate of the earnings rise up toNovember 1978, which gave pensioners a lower uprating last year thanthey should have had.    I was asked to consider not giving short-termbeneficiaries (eg those getting sickness or unemployment benefit)corresponding compensation for the 1 per cent they lost at the same timebecause the prices forecast was too low.3. This restriction would save  10 million in 1979-80 and  30 million in1980-81.    However, on reflection, I am sure that it would be wrong to takethis course:  the additional savings would not justify the controversy.Socially, it would mean that the short-term rates could not have their 1977value restored until the end of 1980 at the earliest.    Presentationally, itmight well be soen as inconsistent with the Prime Minister&apos;s undertakingbefore the Election and again on 22 May to take account of the shortfall. Itwould make the change to prices only uprating across the board that muchmore difficult.    It would also rub salt in the wounds already likely to beopened by my proposal to the Chief Secretary to save around  40 millionthis year by extending the &quot;waiting days&quot; from three to six.AN EARLIER DATE FOR THE UPRATING4-        It was suggested that the gap between the Budget announcement of thenew rates and their introduction should be shortened.    To bring the wholeuprating forward by, say, four weeks (even if it were operationally possible)would cost  160 million in 1979-80.    If the forecast for the shorter period1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALenabled the uprating to be reduced by as much as 1^ per cent, the additionalcost of an earlier uprating would still be about  65 million in 1979-80.I suggest we cannot ai ord this.5.        It was suggested that it might be possible to bring forward, say,payment of the long-term contributory benefits uprating, leaving theshort-term and supplementary benefits (it is the manual operation on thelatter which takes the time) to follow later.    This, though attractive,leaves out of account the if million pensioners and other long-termbeneficiaries whose contributory benefits are topped up by supplementarybendfit (SB).    To increase contributory benefits before supplementarybenefits would mecja that the latter were first decreased (as what theysupplemented rose) and then increased.    This would revive all the angerand misunderstandings which, colleagues will remember, used to bearoused when national insurance benefits were increased and SB cut at thesame time,60        Even if all this wore politically acceptable, I have to tell colleaguesthat it would not be possible operationally.    As it is, we are not going to beable to pay all the SB increases by the due date, because the date of theuprating announcement is much later this year than usual.    To add a doubleoperation for if million beneficiaries would risk serious breakdown andwould arouse fierce staff opposition.7. I shall ensure that everything possible is done to get the increasesinto payment from 1Z November, and that is the best we can do this year.For the future, colleagues will know that simplification of the SB systemis in hand, as well as progress on the computerisation of the social securitysystem generally.    While I cannot promise radical changes quickly, I shallbe seeking more flexibility for the future, and will keep colleagues informedof progress.CONCLUSION8. I seek agreement to the November uprating proposals set out inc(?9) 9, with the 1978 &quot;shortfall&quot; taken into account for both short and long-term beneficiaries.P JApartment of Health and Social Security29 May I979CONFIDENTIAL
