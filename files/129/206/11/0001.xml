CONFIDENTIALMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTC(79)H22 May 1979COPY NO 76CABINETREVIEW OF EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMESMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury1. Cabinet have already discussed expenditure cuts in 1979-80(CC(79) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 4).    We must next turn to the much moresubstantial cuts needed in the expenditure plans we inherited for later yearsin order to carry through our strategy of tax cuts, of monetary discipline,and of curbing waste.2. The regular annual public expenditure survey can provide the frame -work for our decisions. This will come to Cabinet after the Budget. Thatwill be the time fcr substantive discussions.3. We need however to give instructions to officials now to provide thefactual and analytical material which we shall need. I propose that we askofficials to report by the end of June on the following:a, A description of the inherited programmes:  objectives, amountsallocated under the previous plans, and what those allocations can beexpected to achieve.    In many cases we shall be changing theprogrammes, but we need the initial factual base.b. Where those programmes can be cut. I ask my colleagues toinstruct their Departments to identify as options the widest possiblerange of reductions in expenditure which are realistic and feasible.4. Much thought was given to this when we were in Opposition.    I amcirculating a separate paper summarising the outcome of those discussions(C(79) 10).    The cuts then agreed would not get us to the broad objectivesstated in Opposition of bringing expenditure back to the 1977-78 level. Weneed to go further.    The options identified under 3b. should therefore includethe reductions in mind when we were in Opposition but should not be limited tothose.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL5. Defence and law and order should be exceptions.    Here we envisagedincreases but the Departments concerned should still be asked to effect themaximum economy in the use of resources before formulating proposals fornew money.    In health, where we said we did not intend to reduce spending,the maximum cuts should be identified within the Manifesto commitment.6. I propose that for each of the remaining programmes eachDepartment should produce options amounting to its share of the cutsidentified in Opposition, or (if greater)     per cent of its programmes in1980-81, as in Cmnd 7439 (or in some cases its share of programmes),12j per cent in 1981-82 and 17^ per cent in 1982-83.    This formula has beencalculated to produce options amounting to some  5 billion in 1980-81, risingto around  10 billion in 1982-83.    These amounts would enable us to meet ourbroad objective of bringing the total of public expenditure back to the 1977-78level over the lifetime of the Parliament, and would allow us a limited degreeof choice combined with some modest increases in the programmes to whichwe are giving priority.7. For 1983-84, the year now being brought into the Survey for the firsttime, options identified should not be less than those for the previous year.8. The volume savings resulting from our cash limits policy and othersavings this year should be carried forward as a permanent contribution to thereductions we want.    In parallel with the rest of the expenditure survey, theCivil Service Department will be separately examining the further savingsneeded in Civil Service Departmental administration.    As a general principle,we should be looking for cuts in current expenditure and not putting adisproportionate burden on capital.9. We shall need a note of any unavoidable additional requirements. Butthese will make our task harder.    They must be kept to a minimum, andgenerally limited to areas where we have a definite commitment.     Even thereany additions must be offset as far as possible by economies and eradicationof waste.    If net additions are considered inescapable, their timing must berelated to resources and to what savings are being achieved elsewhere.10-       When officials have completed reports assembling the material overthe whole field, I will bring to Cabinet, for discussion of substance,considered proposals based on but not necessarily limited to the optionsidentified by officials.Meanwhile we should avoid premature commitment to particular levelsQf expenditure beyond this year for individual services until we have surveyedthe whole field and taken co-ordinated decisions.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLOCAL AUTHORITIES12. Our approach to local authority spending should be on the same lines asfor central Government.    The local authorities will expect to be consulted, andwe do not want to cause unnecessary friction by ignoring them. TheSecretary of State for the Environment will no doubt want to outline our generalapproach to the Consultative Council.     The Committees on individualprogrammes should then be asked to consider the scope for reductions on thelines proposed, and to report by the end of June.13. The amount of detail given to these Committees as to cuts we have inmind will need care.    There will be some risk of leaks and misrepresentation.But we can make clear that these are options, not yet Ministerial decisions.We cannot allow the consultative machinery to block our own consideration ofthe full range of possibilities.    But the best way to deal with the localauthorities is to tell them our overall targets for reductions which concernthem, and ask them to consider how best to achieve these.NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES14. The nationalised industries will be the subject of a separate inter-departmental report based on the investment programmes and financingestimates recently submitted by the industries, including appropriate optionsfor ths individual industries.    Here again the options need to be as wide aspossible.    The report should be available for Ministers to consider when weconsider public expenditure generally.SALE OF ASSETS15. There should be a separate report on the scope for selling assets orshares, whether in the nationalised industries or elsewhere.     The FinancialSecretary, Treasury, has initiated work on some specific possibilities, but allDepartments should consider what they can contribute.    The economic andmonetary effects will vary.16. Sales of assets are not a substitute for cuts in continuing programmes.CONCLUSION17-       I invite the Cabinet to agree:-1.       We need to get the maximum possible cuts in expenditureprogrammes as a crucial element in our strategy.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL2. Officials should be instructed to pursue the first stage of thepublic expenditure survey as indicated in this paper, and to reportthe end of June.3. The local authority aspect should be handled on the lines ofparagraphs 12 and 13 above.WJBTreasury Chambers22 May 19794CONFIDENTIAL
