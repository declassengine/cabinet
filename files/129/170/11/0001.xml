iHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73)71 COPY NO      f) Jj19 June 1973CABINETHOUSING FINANCE ACT: CLAY CROSS urban district council memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. When the position of Clay Cross was last considered in Cabinet on1 March I undertook to keep colleagues informed of developments,particularly in regard to the counciUors1 appeal against their surchargeby the District Auditor for losses incurred as a result of failure to implement the Housing Finance Act.2,        There are now two developments.    The hearing of the councillors1appeal has been fixed for 9 and 10 July;  and the forthcoming Orderestablishing i:successor parishes&quot; will affect the position with regard toelections if the present councillors lose their appeal and are in consequencedisqualified for office.3.        The constitutional position in Clay Cross has so far beencomplicated by the fact that it has arisen during the run-up to localgovernment reorganisation, and during this period the normal provisionfor elections to fill casual vacancies has been suspended for those councilsabout to go out of existence.    There has, therefore, been a prospect of theCounty Council exercising their optional power to appoint new councillorsfor Clay Cross in order to keep local government in the area in being if thepressnt councillors&apos; appeal failed and the whole council were disqualified.In these circumstances the appointees would have served until 1 April next,when the area will in any event be taken over by a new district council.Clay Cross wiU only have six members out of 51 on this council and there isa good prospect that the Clay Cross difficulties will then cease,4. The Local Government Boundary Commission have, however,included Clay Cross (along with 200-odd other areas) in their recommenda-tions for successor parish councils to serve the areas when the presentcouncils go out of existence.    The successor parish councils will havenormal parish council functions only, and inherit virtually none of the urbandistricts1 property.    So there will be no scope for a continuation after Aprilof the kind of activities the urban district council has pursued.    But the1
first parish councillors are to be the urban district councillors in office at the time of the changeover, so the ban of filling casual vacancies in the urban district council is lifted where a successor parish council is to beestablished,,5. The Boundary Commission^ report is being published on 19 June,and I am then announcing my decision to accept their recommendations in total.    The natural date for operation of this order would be an early one:either 21 days after laying (say 19 July) or more likely immediately onlaying (say 28 June) so that the scatter of casual vacancies that must havebeen accumulating in the other councils since the beginning of the year canbe filled before the Recess.6.        In the case of Clay Cross an early operative date would mean thatif the councillors&apos; appeal were dismissed on 10 July the elections would beheld by 9 August.    The new councillors would almost certainly wish to pursue the same policies as the present ones.    Unless a HousingCommissioner were put in, the whole process would start again withcontinuing controversy and the Housing Finance Act would not be implemented until some time after 1 April 1974, on the assumption that thenew district council would implement it.7.        Alternative courses would be either to defer making the order or tomake the operative date of the order 1 January 1974: for technical reasons could not deier it longer.    If either of these were done I would encourageDerbyshire County Council to use their powers to appoint a council to actin the interim until a new council was elected in January.8.        Any course gives scope for considerable embarrassment: the earlytiming would make it essential to appoint a Housing Commissioner, whichwe have so far avoided in this case.9. To make the order now with its coming into effect later could be embarrassing: first because of the effect of delay on the other councilsconce   ed, and the lack of any convincing reason I could give for thatdelayj  and secondly because the county council might decide not to appoint a new council, or might ask for a Housing Commissioner to be put in before they appointed a council for the other duties of the local authority.CONCLUSION10.       Only three courses are open to me -1. To make the Successor Parishes Order forthwith, to be operative in all respects from the date of laying, and, if theClay Cross councillors lose their appeal against surcharge andare thus disqualified, to appoint a Housing Commissionerimmediately thereafter.2
2. To make the Order forthwith and to defer the operative dateof the Order to 1 January 1974, and, if the Clay Cross councillorslose their appeal, to seek to persuade the County Council toappoint a Council to implement the Housing Finance Act; if Ifail to persuade them, I would appoint a Housing Commissioner.3.        To publish the Boundary Commission^ report; to say thatI accept the recommendations in full and that I shall be laying thenecessary Order in due course.    A 1 January operative date would look more reasonable in October.11.        On balance I think we could probably justify course 3 but I am bound to warn that we may be subjected to criticism for the delay.G r department of the Environment18 June 19733
