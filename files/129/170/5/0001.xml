H.10 Downing Street,8 June, 1973.SECRET
STRATEGY, 1973I.  REAL ISSUES AND CURRENT POLITICS: IS THERE A GAP ?Many people in this country now believe politics to be a private game. Itsparticipants, they say, are not interested in the same things as is the country at large. Worse, the players have no view worth mentioning about the reallyimportant issues; or, if they do, the division of opinion does not always followparty lines so effective choice by the voter is difficult. This view is no doubtan exaggeration. In this summer&apos;s Strategy Presentation, however, the CPRSwill take the devil&apos;s advocate role; will argue that at least on three crucial issuesit is indeed true that the Government has yet to find a clear sense of direction;and will try to delineate options. Clarity about the sense of direction on these issues is essential both for consistent decision taking and for coherent presentation of large segments of ongoing policy. The CPRS is of course under no illusionthat the process of achieving this sense of direction and of setting strategicobjectives will be an easy one.H.  THREE CRUCIAL ISSUESA. GrowthAlternative propositions:(i) Our underlying growth rate is too fast for sensible conservation of resources and a tolerable quality of life; or(ii) Our underlying growth rate is adequate; or(iii) Our underlying growth rate must be accelerated; or(iv) Propositions (i) to (iii) are academic because Governments cannot alterunderlying growth rates.B. Counter-inflationAlternative propositions :(i) The control of prices, incomes and profits cannot be maintained exceptin the very short term and an early return to the old freedoms is,therefore, inevitable; or(ii) Although control will be needed for the next year or so, a freer system will become possible during the lifetime of the present Parliament; or(iii) Control will be necessary for at least the next two to three years; the argument now should be about the best method of control.141232
C.  &quot; One nation &quot;Alternative propositions:(i) The &quot; laissez faire &quot; position.  The maintenance of one nation requiresminimum standards of equality of opportunity and welfare for those most in need, and the minimum possible State intervention in the resulting society; or(ii) The &quot; reactive &quot; position. One nation requires, in the interests of socialcohesion, the meeting of such demands for a narrowing of currentdifferences in income, wealth and social status as may at any given time appear to have widespread support; or(iii) The &quot; progressive&quot; position.   One nation implies that a systematicnarrowing of these differences must be an underlying object ofGovernment policy.m.  THE CPRS PRESENTATIONThis will be designed, with the help of visual material, to enable Ministers toconsider their basic attitude to these issues; their preferences as between the10 propositions listed above; and the policy implications which these suggest.
