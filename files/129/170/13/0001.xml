THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 73 COPY NO    652 July 1973CABINETMAPLIN: ACCESS ROUTES AND NEW TOWNCONSULTATION DOCUMENTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment.        The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the environment at their meeting on 11 June approved in principle my proposals to issue consultation documents on the motorway/railaccess routes from outer London to Maplin and on the new towndesignation area.    It was then agreed that the document should bepublished at the end of June.2. The draft consultation documents have since been seen bycolleagues.    Their suggestions for amendment have been taken intoaccount in the revised drafts already circulated.    Two broad questionsremain:i.      the timing of publication;ii.      road connections inside London.3. On timing, Ministers have given repeated undertakings inParHament and elsewhere that these proposals will be put to the public as early as possible.   The Government is also generally committed toletting the public have an early say in the future planning of new roads.During the passage of the Maplin Development Bill, there has beenpressure on the Government to give information now on all aspects ofthe project.    Partly in response to that pressure the Government has indicated that it will report to Parliament before giving approval to the start of reclamation.    That report will have to cover all aspects of the project, including the access route and the new town area.    PubHcconsultation on these two aspects is a necessary precursor to a decisionon the preferred route and the area of the new town.4.        Although publication will inevitably provoke some furtheropposition, to defer consultation would certainly lay the Governmentopen to charges of failing to comply with its undertakings and ofdeliberately concealing information necessary for the understanding ofthe Maplin project as a whole.    On balance, deferring consultationwould probably involve greater risk to the Bill.1
5. On the issue of road connections inside London, there is thecomplication that Layfield&apos;s report on the Greater London development plan (GLDP) is currently before me for decision, while the GLC have announced a radical review of all their major road proposals.   Amongthe relatively few proposals which look reasonably firm are the London-Cambridge motorway (Mil), now out to tender, and the London-Ipswichmotorway (Ml2).    The latter is a long-standing development planproposal, but its alignment and proposed intersection with the Mil and north Circular at South Woodford were questioned by Layfield.    I am,however, now satisfied that the original proposals must stand and I am prepared to announce this decision.    Either the Mil or the M12 wouldprovide a better means of bringing increased airport traffic to theLondon road network than would any radial route, existing or proposed,on the west or south of London to which traffic from Heathrow or Gatwickwould flow.    This must be an important factor in favour of planning to divert a large proportion of London&apos;3 airport road traffic growth towardsMaplin.6. It would be highly inadvisable to include in this consultationdocument mention of the controversial proposal for extending the Milto Hackney, or other matters at issue in the GLDP.    The only practicable way of making progress is to present proposals for roadaccess to Maplin which connect with reasonably firm existing roadproposals.    A connection with Mil or M12 radials would enable Maplintraffic to be dispersed along me otiter London orbital xoad (Ml6) andthe North Circular Road.    Inwards of this, traffic to and from Maplinwill form only a small proportion of the total traffic in the inner Londonsystem.    In my vie ft, holding up the Maplin motorway consultationuntil a solution to inner London^ traffic movements begins to emergecould lead to interminable delay.7. Both the access routes and the proposed designated area for thenew town affect important agricultural interests.    It is my intentionto send copies of both documents to the National Farmers Union and theCountry Landowners Association and to invite their comments.8.        I recommend that:i.    the consultation documents be published as soon as can be satisfactorily  arranged;ii.    the proposals for road access should cover the route tothe Outer London Orbital Road and, more generally, theNorth Circular Road, but should not be taken further thanexplained in paragraph 2. 6 of the consultation document.GRDepartment of the environment  July 1973

PREFACE .The Maplin project involves a major land reclamation scheme, thebuilding, manning and-operation of an international airport anddeep-sea port, tho provision of new motorways and railways, andthe carrying out of a large scale programme of urban expansionwithin a regional planning framework.     The implementation period will extend to the turn of the century and beyond.The project affects a wide range of interests.     The Government have undertaken that the fullest information will be made available asthe preparatory work progresses and that there will be wideconsultations at each key stage before major decisions are taken.Thus, the siting of the airport within the general location of theMaplin Sands was determined after the public had been consulted onthe choice of sites for the runways.     The site eventually selected wasnot the cheapest:     extra costs were accepted in the interests of reducing the numbers of houses affected by the predicted noise shadow.Following this, the Government published at the end of last year aMaplin Development Bill to secure powers and to set up a public agency to reclaim and manage land at i-aplin and to make areas available fortho airport and a seaport.     This Sill is being considered byParliament with opportunities for the public hearing of petitions.
Consulting engineers1 investigations into feasible corridors within whichroutes for the proposed London-Maplin motorway could be located have now beecompleted.     An explanatory document identifying the broad corridor optionsis being published for general comment before decisions are taken on whichcorridor to select for further more detailed survey and design.     any subsequent detailed route proposals will bo the subject of a further round of consultations.This document concerns the intended designation of a new town area and the setting up of a new town development corporation to help carry out the substantial urban development which will be needed in South East Essex, as announced by the Government in August 1972.The New Towns Act 1965 requires the Secretary of State to consult thelocal authorities concerned and to define any area he proposes to designatein a formal Draft Designation Order.       In this case, the Government havedecided to invite public comment on the tentative designation area proposals at the same time as they consult the local authorities.     The next step willbe the publication of a Draft Designation Order, which will be prepared in the light of comments received on the present suggested proposals.This will afford a further opportunity for comment and if there are thenany objections a public inquiry will be held before any Designation Order isfinally made.Any comments should be sent, not later than 28 September 1973) toThe SecretaryDepartment of the EnvironmentRoom P3/008B2 Marsham StreetLondon S W 1P 3EB

CHAPTER 1THE MAPLIN FROJECTTHE AIRPORT, SEAPORT, ETC COMPLEX ON MAFLIN SANDS1.1     On 26 April 1971, tho Government announced that it accepted therecommendation of the Roskill Commission on the need for a Third london airport with its first runway operational by I98O.   The airport would be builton a reclaimed area of the Maplin Sands, rather than on any of theCommission&apos;s three inland sites at Cublington, Thurleigh or Nuthampstead,in order to avoid &quot;the irreversible damage that would be done to largetracts of countryside and to many settled communities.&quot;1.2     On 2 February 1972, the Secretary of State for the Environment(Mr Peter Walker) made a statement about the scope of the Maplin project.He said that, in addition to the airport, the Government saw no objection in principle to seaport development at Maplin and were informing thePort of London Authority that they were free to put forward firm proposalsfor detailed scrutiny under the Harbours Act 196*1-.     The statement ruled out the location at Maplin of industries such as steelworks, oil refineriesand petro-chemical works, but said that options should otherwise be kept open   and that demand for secondary industry, hotels, offices, and othercommercial development should be considered as it arose in the light of theGovernment&apos;s regional, industrial and environmental policies, and developingrelationships with Europe.
. /1.3    A document inviting comment on whore the airport runways should be sitedon the Maplin Sands was issued; . and, on 9 August 1972, the parliamentary under Secretary of State for the Environment (Mr Eldon Griffiths) announced the Government&apos;s final decision on the chosen site.RECLAMATION1&apos;Jf   The first-stage reclamation of the Maplin and Foulness Sands v/illprovide about 5,900 acres for a 2 runway airport and 2,500 acres for a proposed deep-sea oil terminal and container berths.     If the airport isultimately developed to four runways a second stage reclamation could bringthe total reclaimed aroa to about 18,500 acres.     The necessity to create ahydraulically acceptable shape at both stages will produce areas surplus to specific airport and seaport requirements.1.5     Subject to the passage of the Maplin Development Bill, which has nowpassed its Third Reading in the House of Commons, the reclamation work willbe undertaken by a Maplin Development Authority whose objects will be:(a) to make available reclaimed land on which the British airports authority and the Port of London Authority can construct the airport and seaport respectively;(b) to maintain, drain and generally act as landlord for the reclaimedland;   and(c) to develop reclaimed land rot required for the airport and seaportfor industrial, commercial, recreational and other uses in association with the private sector.
1.6     Planning is on the basis that Maplin will be connected to London&apos;souter London orbital route (M&apos;l6)proposed primary road network at the,   /     by a new motorway, to be in-use by the time the first runway is operational;   and to inner London by ahigh-speed public transport link.     Initially, tho latter could be aconventional railway terminating at King&apos;s Cross, but trains could run at125 miles per hour or more and in due course possibly even faster.     Thefirst steos in choosing possible routes for a motorway/rail corridor fromOuter London to Maplin are the subject of a separate consultation document which is being oublished at the same time as this document.&apos;1.7     In addition, British Rail are proposing to extend the existingFenchurch Street line from Thorpe Bay to serve the seaport and otherdevelopments at Maplin Sands.     Proposals will also have to be worked out for providing new local road access which can satisfactorily link with themain road systems of South Essex and provide connections with the existing and new urban areas.     Because the reclamation and development of theMaplin Sands is planned to proceed broadly from south to north, all these new means of access, including the motorway and high-speed link, will haveto enter the Maplin complex at its southern end.-URBAN development .8     In the statement on 9 August 1972, referred to in paragraph 1.3,Mr Eldon Griffiths said:&quot;Manlin will create a need for large-scale urban development inSouth East Essex.     My Rt Hon Friend intends that this shall be built to the highest environmental standards.     Tho Government propose to designate a substantial area for development by a New Town development corporation, working in close collaboration with the local planning authorities.&quot;
1.9    Tho following chapters provide some preliminary estimates of thegeneral acale and nature of the urban growth that may have to be providedfor and set out factory which eeem to the Goverrjuent important in deciding the location and extent of the designated area.     They also indicate the government&apos;s provisional view of the boundaries of the area which might be designated.
CHAPTER 2THE MAPLI?! area the AREA NOW2.1     The airport&apos;s coastal situation on reclaimed land has minimised theland area v/hich could bo affected by aircraft noise (see Map 1);   it hassubstantially reduced the total demands for agricultural land v/hich aninland site would have generated.     But the geography of the chosen site(see Map 2) also means there is a relatively restricted choice of landareas v/hich the Maplin complex and its workers could draw upon for new housing and for urban and recreational facilities.     There will be, as atpresent, journey-to-work movements between Maplin&apos;s immediate hinterlandand places further afield - London, the Thurrock Thameside, Chelmsford and,depending on the convenience of any future lower Thames crossing, North KentBut the main areas to v/hich Maplin could reasonably lock are broadlycontained to the north and south by the estuaries of the Blackwater andthe Thames   and to the v/est by the approved Metropolitan green belt(see Map 3)*2.2     These areas extend little more than 20 miles from east to west and about 15 miles from north to south.     Even within this relatively limitedarea the tidal reaches of the river Crouch present a barrier.     North ofthis the Dengie peninsula is rural in character with extensive open and
remote areas at the Dengie Marshes and alongside the Blackwater estuary. This rural area extends westwards to include Danbury Hill and the Sandon Brook catchment area with Hanningfield Water, though there is dormitory housing at, for example, Danbury, Stock and South Woodham Ferrers. There are important sailing centres at Burnham-on-Crouch and on the Blackwater. In the present development plan large areas of this northern belt of countryside are identified as of landscape value or of nature conservation interest (see Map 3). The Essex County Council&apos;s policy is to resist any spread of Maplin associated urban development to areas north of the Crouch estuary.

2.3 To the south the area is traversed by the Liverpool Street-Shenfield-Southend and the London-Tilbury-Southend railways and the main roads A 127 and A 13; it contains substantial urban and semi-urban areas at Billericay, Wickford, Basildon, Canvey and in the Southend peninsula, together housing about 450,000 people.* However, the high-grade farmlands of the basin of the river Roach and the islands of Foulness, Wallasea and Potton remain as major agricultural areas (see Map 4).

Southend-on-Sea, a large seaside town with important dormitory and service functions and a rapidly developing office centre, has a population of about 165,000. Over 80,000 live in Basildon new town which is being built as part of the well established programme for relieving congestion in London. There is a net daily outward movement of about 45,000 workers from the southern area as a whole. Most go to London and the commuting movements cause difficulties for both London and

*The area referred to includes

i) Southend-on-Sea CB, Rayleigh UD, Benfleet UD and Rochford RD (together comprising the "Southend peninsula");

ii) Basildon UD (including Basildon New Town) and Canvey Island UD.


the areas from which the commuters are drawn.     Outside Southend some ofthe built-up and partly built-up areas are characterised by poor layoutand a lack of a full range of services - a legacy of haphazard land salesat times of former agricultural depression.2.h     The current local authority development plans include much of theundeveloped and partly developed land in this southern area within a proposed eastward extension of the Metropolitan Groen Belt.     An objectivehas been to concentrate building on the main existing urban-nuclei and toimprove these by making-up roads and putting in additional services.Also, by net making building land indiscriminately available, the plans have aimed, inter alia, at controlling urban growth to a rate in line withthe development of local employment opportunities with a view to reducingthe area1s dependence on long journeys-to-work to London.     Within the framework of these plans a population increase of more than ^0,000,together with a further 35-^0,000 at Basildon new town, could take place during the present decade - roughly comparable with a total growth of83,000 during 1961-71 -     Although under these policies there have beenimprovements in the area&apos;s infrastructure there is no significant built-incapacity for expansion in many of the local services;   in particular,,there is no coherent local main road framework outside Southend andBasildon.MAPLIN AND CURRENT PLANNING FOLICIES2.5    On recent trends it could be expected that during the 1970&apos;s therewould be a continuing growth of manufacturing industry mainly at Bosildonand further office building at Southend and B^sildon town centres.But the consequent growth of local employment would not be likely to beon a scale which would diminish the relative importance of commuting inthe area&apos;s economy.
2.6     Towards the cad of the present decade   tho copulation of Baoildonnew town     may have reached 110,000 against a designed capacity of 1f(0,C00, andwill still bo growing.     Elsewhere, if existing development plans remain unchanged, growth will be slowing down as the supply of agreed new servicedareas for house building is used up.     The local planning authorities have,however, been re-formulating their policies in the light of the Maplindecision and also in line with the Strategic Plan for the Soiith East. The latter was accepted by the Government in October 1971 as a framework for guidingthe broad future distribution of population and employment changes in thoRegion.     In this plan, which was prepared jointly on behalf of theGovernment, tho South East Economic Planning Council and tho StandingConference on London and South East Regional Planning, South Essex wasidentified as an area where major growth should be promoted.     An indicatedpopulation growth of the order of 270,000 was suggested for the periodbroadly from 1981 to the end of the century, together with about 70,000for the adjoining Chelmsford area.     The plan further suggested that ahigher rate of growth &quot;would be acceptable and even desirable if it couldbe achieved without detriment to environmental standards.&quot;     Maplin is the key to the implementation of this regional planning policy.     It willprovide the necessary new employment base and bring a radical improvementin road and rail communications.     All this will help redress the inbalancebetween this part of Essex and the hitherto more favoured parts of the Region.
CHAPTER 3dsvklcpm;OPPORTUNITIES3.1     Tho development of Kaolin vri.ll produce a complex and continuing seriesof interactions.     For example, the demand for labour at the airport is bound to change journey-to-work patterns, encourage large-scale housebuilding and draw new population into the area;   the new transport facilities could attract industrial and commercial growth, subject to regional, and local planning policies and to the constraints of competingdemands for labour.&apos; 3*2     The Government and the local planning authorities will wishto ensure that growth proceeds in an orderly fashion with full regard to regional and environmental policies.      There will be scope for effectivepolicy action in these fields;   but there will always be elements of uncertainty in forecasting to be allowed for.     On present estimatesit is suggested that it would be reasonable and prudent to take thenecessary preparatory planning work forward on the basis that an additional250-300,0^0 people may have to be provided for, broadly during the lasttwo decades of the century, over and above the growth that could be envisaged within the concepts of the present local development plans forthe area.
3.3    With this scale- of urban growth, open countrysidewill assume ever higher value   as a source of recreation and leisure and as a means of providing major visual breaksin tho built environment giving it structure, interest and identity.     Itwill be especially important to safeguard those areas which can retainqualities of remoteness, to avoid disturbance of areas significant for natureconservation and to leave open, but accessible, those waterside and other areas which can be used for recreation.     And, in an area of generally lowrelief, it will be necessary to take full advantage of any topographicalfeatures which could provide focal points of interest within the urban areas.3.*f    In this context, Map 3 attempts to identify the main areas, many ofwhich already attract some form of statutory protection, upon which thecommunity might be expected to place a specially high value as permanentlyopen land.     They include:(a) the&apos;whole of the Blackwater estuary which is of regionalof exceptional importance forsignificance for recreation and/nature conservation; it is-currently being investigated as an area for wildlife relocation;(b) the wide open areas of the Bradwell and Bengie Marshes,whichpossess unique qualities of spaciousness, and the adjoiningBengie Flat which is of special nature- conservation interest;(c) the Crouch valley upstream to Brandyhole Reach, which will beused increasingly.for recreation;(d) the marshlands separating the built-up areas of South Benfleetand Pitsea from the Thnmoside oil installations^
the woodlands and commons of the Danbury Hillarea which are noted for their scenic and nature conservationinterest;the upper valley of the Sandon Brook, including Hanningfield\7ater and     Norsey Wood, which is strategically placed inrelation to existing large areas of population and could have potential as an area of country parks and for natureconservation;the existing major open sites within the built-up areas of theSouthend peninsula, comprisingi.     Hadleigh Downs, where the County Council are presentlyproposing to establish a country park, and adjoining areasof Leigh Marsh which the Southend-on-Sea Corporation have offered the Nature Conservancy as a possible nature reserve;ii.     Great Wood, West Wood and the woods around Daws Keath atHadleigh;iii.     Hockley Woods, Potash Wood and the  adjoining unbuilt-onareas &apos; between Rayleigh and Hawkwell whichcould eventually become a major park;iv.     Plumberow Mount and some of the neighbouring wooded hillsidesin the Hockley area.
LAND im UR-3AH FUXEOSES -------  .3.5     Within such a &quot;green setting&quot;, most of the land not already developedor committed by current plans or permissions is physically capable ofbeing built upon without high development costs though special cai^e withfoundations would be necessary in some of the low lying areas around therivers and creeks in the east of the area whore there would also be extracosts associated with bridges, flood protection and drainage.3.6     However, in relation to the Maplin project, the most suitable areas for development are within the Roach basin north of Southond, excluding the islands.     The available land hero is, for the most part, levelfarmland presenting no unusual problems of land, assembly or construction.There is scope for the installation of a regional drainage scheme whichcould serve existing and new urban areas, as well as the Maplin complex,with treated effluent discharged to deep water offshore.     Some of these areas are conveniently placed for the regional shopping and town centrefacilities in Southend&apos;s central area where major redevelopment and expansionis well advanced;    though clearly all butthe initial new urban areas wouldhave to be planned from the outset around a now hierarchy of service centres.Among these areas, that north of the Roach and east of Rochford andAshingdon is tho largest green field area available within relatively-shortjourney-to-work distance of Maplin:    it offers great scope for originalityand variety in design and layout with the tidal Roach itself as a specialfeature.     From this standpoint it would be an advantage if the corridorultimately chosen for the motorway and high-speed rail link to Maplinwere one which would not restrict the possibilities of this potentiallyvaluable building area.
3-7    Against this, development within thosS&quot;&quot;ai*oas could eventually mean theloss ox over 9,CoO acres of grade land 2 agricultural land.     One of themain elements in the Government1s land use policies is to ensure, so far aspossible, that good agricultural land is not taken for development when land of a lower quality is available.     The selection of an offshore site forthe airport, while taking full account of the agricultural objections toan inland site, has inevitably reduced the field of choice for locatingthe associated urban development.     Any potential loss of good agricultural land has to be seen in the context of the project as a whole v/hich couldultimately add up to 18,C00 acres of reclaimed land for tho Region1sdevelopment needs.     The net annual loss of agricultural output as comparedwith developing grade 3 land located further from Maplin would be offset by savings in journey-to-work costs.3.8     Because the areas within the Roach basin constitute Maplin&apos;.s nearestlarge-scale areas of easy building land, investment in housing here v/ouldmake the maximum possible contribution to the needs of the project especiallyduring the early years of the airport&apos;s development.     Including some largepockets of potential building land around Hockley and Ilawkwell these areascould, at generously planned standards of development (see Chapter 5),accommodate a now population of near!;/&apos; 2lK),C00.3&quot;. 9     A further population of 60-70,000 could bo housed in the largepockets of undeveloped and partly developed land that form a broad bandstretching from tho Hullbridge area in the north to Thundersley in thesouth and bounded to the west by the line of the A.130 road from Chelmsfordand its proposed extension south to the A.13* These   areas v/ould be less
straightforward to develop than the major green Held sites in the Roachbasin;   nor are they so conveniently placed in relation to Maplin..    Butdevelopment here could help to improve the infrastructure of some of theexisting urban and semi-urban areas and secure the economic use of fragmentedareas that are relatively unattractive for farming.     It would also enablethe new east-west communication links which the area will need to becomprehensively planned into an environmentally acceptable pattern ofland uses.for development3-10   There is thus enough land   /  on green field sites near to Maplinjandin areas within reasonable journey-to-work distance where there are positivereasons for promoting further building and no major objections onAccordingly,agricultural grounds./there seems little justification for bridging   theCrouch and opening up major new areas for building in predominantly rural areas in the Dengie peninsula,consisting in the main of useful and wellfarmed agricultural land.     Nor would large scale building in areas west ofthe A 130 road seem to offer a satisfactory solution even though this v/ouldinvolve land of lower agricultural quality than that of the Roach basin.Not only are these areas 15-20 miles from Maplin but they are well within the London orbit and, in comparison with areas nearer Maplin, a relatively smaller proportion of any housing effort there could be harnessedto Maplin needs so that, in total, larger areas of land would be required for development.GENERAL STRATEGY3.11     With the new growth located mainly within the Southend peninsula,development v/ould be following established patterns along the major west-eastroutes from London, leaving the northern part of the Maplin area substantiallyopen &quot;in character but increasingly important for recreation and natureconservation.     There v/ould be no call for any &quot;immediate changes in thepresent local planning policies.     In particular, Basildon new town would
continue, in the short term, to cuter for relatively short-distance movesof employment and population from London.     Elsewhere, until designs forthe new urban areas had been worked out, the local planning authority&apos;sinterim green belt could bo maintained.
CHAPTER &apos;rCOi iVGS3 OE GROWTH^.1     Although development as suggested in the previous chapter would follow established geographical patterns two features would distinguish thenew generation of urban expansion from that which has previously taken placein southern Essex.     The first is the pace of the build-up, which is likelyto be especially rapid in the 1980&apos;s.     The second and more fundamental difference is that it will be associated with a new growth of employment at the eastern end of the Southend peninsula.     London will cease to be the dominant single source of jobs: children now at school, andthe new population, v/ill have much wider opportunities and    a betterbalanced, more convenient and more economical pattern of journey-to-workmovements could emerge.EMPLOYMENT^.2    The effect of the Maplin project will begin to be noticeable with the start of construction work on the airport, seaport, motorway, high-speedlink, and on the new urban roads and utility services that the area will need.3y the time the first runway is ready for operational use it is estimatedthat there could be about 7j0C0 workers at the airport and perhaps 2,000 atthe seaport;   in addition there could be up to 6,000 construction workersmainly at Maplin and in the Southend peninsula.
k,&apos;5    For tho 19SO&apos;s tho timing and tho size ox tho airport labour demands arthe most crucial factors in estimating total employment demands.     in arriving at those much depends on what assumptions ere made about the growth of passenger traffic and aircraft movements, labour productivity, the extentof maintenance facilities to be provided at Maplin and the timing of their introduction, etc.     The most likely estimate, taking account of factorsdiscussed in the recent Civil Aviation Authority report on air traffic intho South East and of the British Airports authority&apos;s present planningconcepts for   the new airport, is that by about 5 years after opening direct employment could be of the order of 35jOCO;   after about 10 years itcould be around 50,0C0.     These estimates will, of course, bo kept under constant review and will be progressively refined as detailed planningproceeds.     With the opportunities which a spaciously planned new airportv/ill afford for the introduction of the most advanced systems and equipment,the demands for labour cculdbs low in relation to the traffic to bo handled.Even so, a rapid build-up of labour demand in the 1980&apos;s is indicatedand this will have consequences for the house building programme.k.h    The seaport labour requirements arc likely to be much smaller.The Fort of London Authority estimate that tho port will bo employingabout fr,500 by 199&apos;1,on the assumption that there v/ill by then be an oilterminal capable of handling 300,000 ton, and possibly 500,000 tontankers,together with perhaps 10 berths for containers, roll-on/roll-off and forest products.     These estimates include about 1,500 PLA workers and 700 maintenance repair staff together with about 2,300 working at the oil terminal and engaged in freight haulage and forwarding, customs &apos;and health, shipping lines and agencies.
k,5     In addition to direct employment, the airport will give rise.to employment in a variety of ancillary activities such as hotels and freightforwarding and in firms supplying the airport with goods and services, egcatering and cleaning.     It could also attract new industrial and commercialenterprises and encourage the expansion of those existing concerns v/hichcould benefit from being near ah airport.        Investigations of a numberof major airports, including Heathrow and foreign airports, suggest  .that by about 1991 some 10,000 workers could be employed by airportsuppliers and airport ancillary businesses.     The findings&quot;alsoindicate   that while few other types of enterprise actually need to besited close to an international airport, the major improvements inthe area&apos;s communications and the general upswing in building and population growth could attract new industries and commerce.      The keyfactors, as in other locations in the South East, are regional and environmental policy and labour availability.     At Maplin tho situationis likely to be dominated by the employment opportunities on offer atthe airport, so there could be constraints on labour supply.     Thispoints to the need for firm control over development   &quot;not havingessential ties to the area.     However, even on the assumption thatthis control will be carefully operated it is estimated that by about1991 up to 20,000 new jobs in offices and in manufacturing industry could has been generated by the favourable circumstances that Haplin will create.These could be either at Maplin - at the airport , seaport or on land under the control of the Maplin Development Authority - or in existing or new urban areas within the Southend peninsula.     There could also be a smaller    consequent growth of employment at Basildon.
&apos;lt.6     This considerable growth of employment at Maplin and in the Southendpeninsula will create a parallel expansion of jobs in construction and in local services which could be of the order of 35,000.     Althogether, therefore,it is possible that by around 1991 the potential employment in theSouthend peninsula attributable to the Maplin project could amount to something approaching 120,000.     It would be made up of about 50,000 at the airport, nearly 5,000 at the seaport, 10,000 in airport suppliers andairport ancillary businesses, about 20,000 in new &quot;Maplin induced&quot; jobsand about 35,000 in construction and local services. - &apos;J0URNEY-T0-W0RKh.7    New demands for labour on this scale are bound to affect both the growth of the area*s existing industries and journey-to-work patterns.   It is estimatedthat the increase in employment in existing industries and services in theSouthend peninsula over the period 1981-91 is unlikely to exceed 5,000.On the other hand journey-to-work changes could be substantial.     Theiiet daily outward movement of workers from Southend could be reduced from an estimated 30,000 in 1981 to nearer 10,000 in 1991 due to a drop in outward and an increase in inward movements.     It seems likely, forinstance, that some London commuters living in Basildon and Thurrock wouldswitch to what will be the easier journey to Maplin and other local jobs.The building of the proposed Thorpe Bay link will, from the outset, makeMaplin readily accessible from the major existing commuter areas on theFenchurch Street-Southend rail system with the opportunity for producingjournoy-to-work movements in the opposite direction to present peak hourflows.     Labour could also be drawn in to a &quot;limited extent, from v/ider afield -
from Chclmsford, Brentwood, and East London and, if a lower Thames crossingis provided, perhaps from North Kent.     This long-distance commuting is not,however, likely to be on a scale which could significantly affect the demandfor a very large amount of new housing in areas within more acceptablejourney-to-v/ork distances from Maplin.POPULATION AND HOUSINGh,8     Although some of the new demands for labour would be met by peoplechoosing to work locally rather than continuing to commute long distances outof the area, there would still have to be very large increases in the working population of the area.     About a third of the jobs at the airport call for specific skills - aircrew, maintenance engineers, air traffic controllers - forwhich recruitment would need to be at national level.     But many of tho jobsat the airport, and those in associated industries and local services,  willnot be so specialised and could provide a range of job opportunities for people in some of the housing stress areas on the east side of London.This could mean that the traditional outward movement of    people      fromthese areas . in search of better housing in Essex need not, as inthe past,   involve a long Journey-to-work to London.   &quot;      -  -.k.9    Most of the inward movement v/ould be to the Southend peninsulawhere the resulting total population increase over the  period 1981-91 isestimated to be about 200,000, representing an average annual populationincrease of 5%.  On this basis the population of the Southend peninsula could grow
to about half a million by around 1991*     The result would be a populationyounger than at present with more children and younger adults and a smaller proportion of older people.&apos;k.10    Growth on this scale would call for a programme of rapid house building a building rate of about 5-&apos;^000 houses a year could be needed in the initialbuild-up period, rising perhaps to nearly 7,000 a year during the 1930&apos;s.LONG TERM GROWTH^.11     In the 1990&apos;s and beyond, when Maplin would be operating as a majorinternational airport, labour requirements could be expected to increasemuch more slowly in proportion to air traffic as now technology is introduced and productivity increases.      Even at full &apos;f-runway capacitythe airport is not, on current estimates, thought likely ever to need morethan about 70,000 workers.     Forecasting employment for so far ahead ishazardous, but it is estimated that by the end of the century, assumingstrict control continues to be maintained over industrial and commercial development, total employment at Maplin and in the Southend peninsulacould have passed the quarter million mark.
-&apos;r.&apos;12    The associated growth of population in tho Southend peninsula over thoperiod 1991-2001 might be little more than 100,000, representing an annualgrowth rate of about 2/j compared with the 5% expected for the preceding decade.There would be a demand for roughly   an additional ^0,000 houses leading to a building rate of about ^,000 houses a year.SUMMARY*r.13    Over tho period from now till around the end of the century, depending on the policies that will be worked out by the local planning authoritiesin the Structure Plan for the area, it is  conceivable that growth outside theSouthend peninsula could, broadly, be accommodated in Basildon new townand within extensions of areas already allocated for development in existing plans.     In the peninsula itself, however, the likelyscale of increase could be some 300,000 above present planning provisions and, as indicated in Chapter 3, major new areas will be needed for developmentparticularly to- meet the very rapid build-up expected to take place in the1980&apos;s.     Over this period new job opportunities arising from Maplin couldtransform tho area from a major commuting area with, only a slow local employment growth to one of the most buoyant and prosperous areas of theSouth East region.
5.1     The two previous chapters identified the broad scnle of population growth that will have to be planned for in support of the development of the airport and seaport, and suggested th&quot; t, notwithstanding i&apos;;aplin&apos;s locationat the seaward end of a peninsula, there is land to accommodate this growthwithout encroaching on important open areas of coast, estuary and countrysidealthough substantial losses of good agricultural land wiUbe unavoidable,5.2     This chapter examines how the growth of population, which will haveto be very rapid indeed during the 1980&apos;s, con best be achieved withina properly balanced development providing the social, educational and commercial facilities needed to create a successful community.THE TASK5.j5    The primary objective is to provide the housing that will be needed to sustain a properly phased build-up of workers for the airport.     A wide
range of house typos will be in demand not only for airport staff but also for the engineers, construction workers, school-teachers, doctors and other essential workers who v/ill design and build the airport,       seaport,       thenew roads and urban areas,and who will provide the services which the newfamilies will need.     In the initial stages, at any rate, large numbers of dwellings v/ill have to be available to rent to encourage the recruitment oflabour for the more routine jobs at the airport and for single people, suchas the younger members of aircrew staff.     It could not be right to leavethe local housing authorities to face these exceptional demands.5.4 Providing sites and buildings for the social services and for shops,entertainment and service trades, and helping to obtain staff to run them,will be a major organisational task.     Unless it is sucessfully accomplishedin phase with the growth of the airport and a high standard of local services,and of amenities achieved, it will be difficult to attract the very high level of population growth which the project as a whole demands.5.5     Some 18,000 acres may ultimately be required for development.     Becausemuch of the area has evolved from a haphazard pattern of settlement with poorstandards of urban layout and because, in more recent years, planning hasbeen aimed at limiting expansion, there is a need for major investment ininfrastructure.    A start will h?.ve to be made on new road and drainage systemsbefore large-scale development can be put in hand.
5.6     Finally, it is the Government&apos;s intention that the new urban development should be carried out to high environmental standards andthat improvements and benefits should accrue also to the existingbuilt-up areas, some of which are of varying quality and deficient in urban services.     With the pace of development being demanded this calls for an organisation with a comprehensive, detailed design capability and adequate finance.THE BOLE OF A NEW TOWN CORPORATION5.7 A new town corporation, set up under the New Towns Act, is a tailor-made and well-proven instrument for tackling just such a wide-rangingset of large-scale activities.     So far there has been no call for asuch anew town corporation to aim at   /  level of house building   as  will be needed to match the employment demands of Maplin.     The scale of effortrequired is unique.     It will call for a sustained effort by theconstruction industry and the closest collaboration between theCorporation, the local authorities and other public authorities ifdevelopment on this scale is to be carried out on time and in a way which  /ill harmonize with the planning and other policies of the localauthorities not only for South Essex but for the county as a whole;   andif full advantage is to be taken of the opportunities which will be presented for enhancing the quality of living, working and leisureactivities in all this area.     All this was reflected in the decisionannounced in August 1972 that the Government intended to designate asubstantial area of South East Essex for development by a new towncorporation.
5*8    A new town corporation would introduce a groat deal of investmentinto the area in a relatively short space of time;   there will also be considerable public investment in the airport and seaport.     This will inevitably increase land values.     If public authorities had to buy land at the enhanced prices they would be paying for the value that public expenditure had mainly created.     To meet this kind of situation theLand Compensation Acts enable such land purchases within the designatedarea of a new town to be made at a price which leaves out of account theeffects of the carrying out or the prospect of the new town, development. In thepresent case, the Secretary of State intends,    upon publication  &quot;ofa Draft New Town Designation Order, to make an order under S.51of the Land Compensation Act 1975 specifying the Haplin Sands complex asdevelopment whose effect on iand values in the associated Mew Town is also tobe left out of account when public authorities are buying land there.This means that the community - through the corporation, tho localauthorities, the statutory undertakers - will be able to obtain land forschools, housing, services, etc. on these terms.     Land and propertytransactions between private individuals are, however, outside the scopeof these arrangements.AREA SUGGESTED FOR DESIGNATION5.9      In broad terms, the new town corporation for Maplin will be requiredto operate within a development strategy v/hich focuses regional growth .
within the Southend peninsula.     It will, in the process, have to cater forthe foreseeable   requirements of Maplin and, as an   integral part        .   &apos;of the operation, secure the restructuring, improved servicing and furtherbuilding up of existing areas of poor layout and partly completed development.5.10     An important question, upon which the views of the local authorities will bo especially welcome, isthe extent to which existingfully built-built-up areas, within the Southend peninsula, should be included in the designatedarea within which the new town corporation will operate.     Wholesaleredevelopment of these existing urban areas - in Southend, Hadleigh, Rayleighand so oh - is certainly not called for.     But a significant, factor in the-11   11 ..   y,   1Maplin situation is that the Southend peninsula, which already has a populationof 280,000, is to be built up to accommodate, by the turn of the century, a-population of about 600,000.     This is not a task that can be tackled piecemealimportant elements in the new and existing urban systems will have to beconsciously planned on a major city scale.     In particular, a comprehensiveview will need to be taken of the area&apos;s transportation requirements.    A newhierarchy of shopping and service centres will have to be provided withinI which the roles of, for example, the redeveloping Southend central area and the conservation area of Rayleigh town centre can be properly determined.   Inaddition, a number of services and facilities will have to be planned and
provided common to both the existing and the new urban areas - this applies to sev/erage and sewaee disposal and, for example, to higher education and to city level entertainment and cultural facilities.5.11    This points to the need for integrated planning and investmentpolicies for the Southend peninsula as a v/hole and for a new towncorporation exercising responsibilities and deploying resources overmost of the area.   . The Government will want to consult with the localauthorities about the ways in v/hich constructive co-operation betweenthem and a development corporation can best be secured.5.12    With this comprehensive approach the designation area could include:(a) all the potential areas for development indicated in chapter 3i(b) the existing built-up areas of Southend, Hadleigh, Benfleet,Rayleigh and Rochford which v/ill continue to providemany of the area&apos;s urban services and v/hich will need tobe integrated within a new hierarchy of shopping and service centres and linked into new transportationsystems for the enlarged urban areas;   .(c) an area of low lying land to the east of the Wakerings,including Fotton and Rushley islands, which will provideland for major recreational purposes and other uses;   and
(d)    bhe proposed country park at Hadleigh which will be an important feature of the new city&apos;s open space system;   Wallasea Island v/hichwill have a major recreational potential particularly for sailing;and areas of countryside in the Crouch valley and around HockleyWoods which will be essential parts of the city&apos;s open setting.The possible boundaries for such a designated area are shown on Map 5*5.13  Fully developed, within the environmental limits identified in chapter 3, this designated area could accommodate about 600,000 people.&apos;fhe indicative land-uses set out in Table 5A represent this &quot;end-state&quot;situation which could be reached around the turn of the century.     At thisstage the overall population density within the designated area v/ould be 11persons per acre,which is in line with what is envisaged for other major new town areas v/hich have been recently designated.     Some 16,000 acreswithin the designated area would be major open spaces, unbuilt oncountryside, rivers and water areas,and     over     6,000 acres v/ould be laidlocal parks and.out as/school playing fields..   Over two fifths of the total area would thus beThe areas for new urban development indicated on Map 5 are located onlydiagramatically because questions of the precise distribution and siting of the various new land-uses fall to be worked out by the proposed newtown corporation in consultation  with the local authorities.     But theareas represented by the circles are to map scale so as to give a general impression of the extent to v/hich the area could ultimately become built-up.Certainly in terms of space in which to live there is no reason why this level of expansion in the Southend peninsula should not be accommodated.

POLICIES FOR THE NEW TOWN .5.1 *f    Questions of the detailed planning of t-henew town - the hierarchy ofshopping centres, the planning of further education and social facilities,the siting of service industries, the layout and design of housing areas and open spaces - are not matters to be settled at this stage.    Theywill be dealt with in plans v/hich the corporation v/ill eventually preparein collaboration with the local authorities.     But there are clearly some major items of &quot;housing, employment, transportation, etc. policies upon whichearly guidance could be needed.     Some of these are briefly discussed here.5.15      The new town- corporation will have to build houses to rent in order toassist the rapid recruitment of airport labour.   But Maplin will offer a wide range of employment opportunities and it v/ill be desirable to plan the -new town   on the basis that many people   will want to   purchasetheir own houses.&apos;  It is provisionally envisaged that, ultimately, about 70$of all new houses could be owner-occupied.     The average  housing densityused in estimating land requirements has been 10-11 dwellings per acre.This is a reasonably economical figure and, on present public attitudes,gives scope for building a range of house types, within a density range of6-16 dwellings per acre, which would be readily saleable.5.16 But there is no doubt that, if population growth on the scale needed for Maplin is to be achieved, the new town will h-^ve to be very attractivewith a high standard of design and construction and, importantly in some ofthe relatively featureless areas of South East Essex, well landscaped withplenty of tree-planting. There will also have to be careful attention to building-up and maintaining an adequate level of local shopping, education and social services for v/hich the co-operation of the local authorities is going to be essential. .
5.17    With new towns generally, a major concern has&apos; been to keep jobs in step with housing programmes.     At Maplin the task will be to match housingperformance with the labour demands arising at the airport.     Very carefulcontrol will have to be maintained on industrial and office developmentsthat do not have essential ties with the area.     Only a limited allowance of land for industrial purposes has been included in the estimates of landrequirements for the new town;   this would be mainly for service industries.5.18    The transportation system for the new town will be a key element inthe success of the project as a whole.    Maplin will be a major new employmentgenerator at the remote end of a peninsula and the movement system must be designed to make journey-to-work there especially convenient.     However, thescale of the existing and proposed urban development will rule out anentirely private car.solution and an environmentally acceptable and efficientpublic transport system is going to be needed.     The local planning authorities, with their widely publicised &quot;Planning Choice&quot; document, havealready taken a valuable initiative in seeking public attitudes to such an\ i - - v^-Jia . &apos;--* &quot;.issue. -     - &apos; . - 1
conclusion. 19    This Chapter has considered the role of a new tov/n development corporation and has suggested an area for designation to enable development to be undertaken by such a body in close consultation with the localauthorities and other interests.     A possible land use budget has beenillustrated.     Some policies have been discussed in outline, though   clearlydetailed considerations would be a matter for the development corporation,again in consultation with the local authorities and other bodies.5-20    Development on the scale envisaged will bring, change. ; During theconstruction period parts of the area will be bound to suffer some disruption,though careful pre-planning can minimise this.     But the end must be tosecure that the change is essentially a civilised one.     In many respects thechange could be for the better.     By the end of the century parts of these -urbanised area around Rochford, Rayleigh and Hullbridge could have beenprovided with a much better range of services.     There could be a greatly.improved communications network, both road and rail, making local journeyseasier and offering good, direct, access to national and regional road networks.-And there could be better opportunities for recreation and leisure.     Moreover,a broad employment base could afford   to many of the area&apos;s existinginhabitants   an opportunity, for the first time, of working near their homes.5.21     The Government envisages that a new tov/n corporation will have a vital role to play in the rapid growth situation expected to develop in the Maplin area in the 19o0&apos;s.     Its provisional view is that the designated area withinv/hich it should be given powers to operate should be drawn widely enough toenable the job to be tackled on a comprehensive basis.








THE MAPLMM PROJECTSURFACE ACCESS CORRIDORCHOICE OF CORRIDORS FOR MOTORWAY AND HIGH-SPEED RAIL IIMS ..  PREFACE .       .1.    The Maplin project involves a major land reclamation scheme, the building,manning and operation of an international airport&apos;and deep-sea port, the provisionof new roads and railways, and the carrying out of a large scale programme of urban expansion within a regional planning framework.   The implementation -period will extend to the turn of the century and beyond.2.    A project of such scope inevitably affects a wide range of interests.The Government has undertaken that as the preparatory work progressesinfoimation will be made available and that there will be wide consultations at each key stage before major decisions are taken.who may be.     Furthermore proposals to ensure that peopib/ affected have a much earliersay in the planning of new roads were announced by the Secretary of State forthe Environment on 27 March 1973.  The Government have therefore decidedto invite coimnents from local authorities and the public generally on thepossible alternative coi*ridors for the motorway and high-speed rail link to servetho proposed airport and seaport on Maplin Sands.   This consultation documentdeals primarily with the corridors between the proposed outer London orbitalroute (Ml6) and Maplin but also indicates certain consequences for the road and rail systems within London.   It is presented in parallel with a consultationdocument on the area in South East Essex suggested for designation for develop-ment under the New Towns Act.h.     This document sets out the factors which seem important to the selection of the most suitable corridor for further, more detailed, design work and preperation, and indicates the Government1s provisional views on the alternative
corridors. No decisions havo yot boon taken, and none will bo, until tho public have had an opportunity to put forward their views. The detailed designs and   &apos;exact lines of the motorway and high-speed, rail link will bo prepared once the \most suitable corridor has been selected; thereafter these detailed proposals will be subject to a further round of consultations, and statutory procedures,   *including if necessary a Public Inquiry. ^5.     It is important that work on the motorway and high-speed rail link should proceed quickly to ensure that they arc available for traffic before the airport becomes operational.   Also the period before a decision is made onthe most suitable corridor must be kept as short as possible to avoid unnecessary blighting of properties along the alternative corridors.   The publicare therefore invited to send their comments as soon as possible and at thelatest by 28 September 1973 to the Secretary of State for the Environment.,Room P3/062, 2 Marsham Street, London SV/lP 3EB, using if possible .thoquestionnaire which;is available from local council offices and public libraries6.     The Government hopes to be able to announce a decision on the selection ofthe preferred corridor for further detailed planning and design as soon aspossible after the end of the consultation period.

FBCHAPTER 1 . . THE KAFLIH PROJECTTHE AIRPORT AND SEAPORT COI33LEX ON MAPLIN SANDS1.1     On 26 April 1971 ^ the Government announced that it accepted therecommendation of the Roskill Commission on the need &quot;for a Third London Airportwith its first runway operational by 1930.   The airport would be built on areclamation area of the Maplin Sands rather than on any of the Commissionsthree inland sites at Cublington, Thurleigh or Northampstead, in orderto avoid &quot;the irreversible damage that would be done to large tracts ofcountryside and to many settled communities&quot;.1.2    On 2 February 1972, the Secretary of State for tho Environment(Mr Peter Ualker) made of statement about the scope of the Maplin project.He said that, in addition to the airport, tho Government saw no objection in principle to seaport development at Maplin, and were -&quot;informing tho Port ofLondon Authority that they were free to put forward firn proposals for detailed scrutiny under the Harbours Act T96U.   The statement ruled: out tholocation at Maplin of primary industry such as steelworks, oil refineriesand petro-chenical works, but said that Options should otherwise bo kept open and that demand for secondary industry, hotels, offices, and other commercial development should be considered as it arises in the light of the Government&apos;sregional, industrial and environmental policies, and developing relationships with Europe.1 .3    A document inviting coraient on where the airport should be sited on theMaplin Sands was issued; and, on 9 August 1972, tire Joint Parliamentary UnderSecretary of State for the Environment (Mr Eldon Griffiths) announced theGovernment&apos;s final decision on the chosen site.1 .lr    It is intended that the airport should open with one runwayand that the remaining three rum/ays would bo provided as -  ithe growth of air traffic demands.
1.5&quot;    The Maplin complex is to be built on land reclaimed from the sea by aMaplin Development Authority (subject to the passage of the Kaolin DevelopmentBill which has now passed its Third Reading   in the House.of Commons).URBAN development .6.   In the statement on 9 August 1972, referred to in para 1.mr Sldon Griffiths said : .&quot;Maplin will create a need for large-scale urban development inSouth-East Essex.   My Rt Hon Friend intends that this shall be built to the highest environmental standards.   The Government propose to designate a substantial area for development by a Kew Town development corporation, working in close collaboration with the local planning authorities&quot;.The proposals for the designation of the new town area to provide thenecessary urban development in support of the Maplin complex are the subjectof a separate consultation document also published today.ACCESS1.7    The Roskill Commission in their report on alternative sites for theThird London Airport considered that a new motorway and a high-speed rapid.transit link would be necessary to serve the airport.   Accordingly, a newmotors-ray route between the M16 and Maplin was placed in the Trunk RoadPreparation Pool in June 1971.   In December 1972 it was announced that the rapid transit link would be a high-speed railway system, terminating atKing&apos;s Cross, with trains running at 125&quot; miles per hour initially, andpossibly even faster in due course. .
1.3    The Government appointed a firm of consultants, Brian Colquhoun and Partners,to undertake the first stage of the work: a feasibility study into   -alternative corridors for tho motorway and rail link between the M16 and Kaplin.The consultants were asked to pay particular attention to environmentalconsiderations including the effects-on-agriculture and to the possibility of keepingimpact on the environment      to a minimum by selecting a common corridor as-far as possible for the motorway and a high-speed rail link.   The studyalso considered road implications west of M16 and, more recently,. the consultants have been looking separately at the problems of the rail routeson the approach to Kings&apos; Cross from tho common connection near Ml 6.1.9    To minimise the environmental effects during the relcamation and construction stages&apos;,: the vast majority of construction traffic will go by sea and*rail, and heavy traffic travelling to tho Maplin site on the existing road system in tho area will be limited until improved access is available. .... , .It should also be remembered that significant improvements to the major roadnetwork in the South East Essex area would have been necessary with or without the Maplin project.1.10   This consultation document decscribes the alternative corridors whichwere considered feasible by the consultants, the considerations which led to .their selection, and gives a comparative assessment of the alternatives.It also gives the Government1s provisional conclusions on the preferredcorridor but it must be emphasised that the Secretary of State for the environment will take no decision on the selection of the most suitablecorridor for detailed design work until full account has been taken of the comments of the public, local authorities and other bodies on the alternativesset out in this consultation document,
CiDVPTJER 2CHOICE OF CORRIDORSDESIGN STANDARDS - &apos;2;1   Assessments of. future -traffic flows to the airport must be subject to continualupdating.       Decisions      on the number of traffic lanes to be provided for themotorway or the number of tracks for the high-speed rail link must therefore await the next, detailed, design stage.   Solely for the purpose of evaluating the variouscorridors between Ml6 and Maplin the Consultants assumed that a band of land about . &quot;100 yards wide might bo needed, although the initial standards of the motorway and &apos;.rail link may not require the full use of a band of this width.   The final detaileddesigns will take fully into account the need for landscaping noise barriers and where appropriate, of sound insulation in accordance with the provisions of theLand Compensation Act.GENERAL PLA1INIKG CONSIDERATIONS2.2   The possible area for the location of the motorway/rail link corridors isbounded by Chelmsford in the north and the River Thames in the south.   To reducethe effect on residential areas and employment, existing urban areas and smallcommunities in the area were avoided in selecting potential corridors *   particular attention was paid to assessing the impact of each of the corridors on areas ofamenity or nature conservation interest,2.3   The main purpose of the motorway is to carry traffic direct between thenational road network, the London area and Maplin, but there will be a limited number of interchanges with the general.purpose road network.   These interchangeswill enable the motorway to provide relief to the other main east-west roads inthe South Essex area, but the degree of relief will depond on the route eventuallyselected.2.h   The railway will be designed to provide a high speed link between King Is Crossand Maplin and is intended to bo tho principal moans of transport for passengerstravelling between London and the Airport,
CONSTRAINTS AT MAPLIN2,$ It is proposed to develop the airport from the southern end northwards, andto locate the seaport at the south east of the reclamation aroa. .    .It is therefore necessary for road and rail access to enter the reclaimed area from the southern end near Havengore Creek and then be developed northwards as necessary to serve the various parts of the airport.   A spur road from the motorwaywould be provided to the seaport.LINKS TO THE LONDON AREA2.6   If the motorway is to provide an effective road link with greater London areait must connect with the proposed outer London orbital route (the Ml 6) to enable,traffic to disperse to a variety&apos;of destinations, and also with either the Mil. M12or A13 existing or proposed radial corridors for traffic going further into London,It is expected however that the majority of passengers to the airport will use thehigh-speed rail link and hence Maplin road traffic flows will in general have a relatively small effect on total traffic flows on the London road network.   As aresult the motorway to the airport need not add significantly to the requirements for the road system already proposed for Greater London.   Three points of entry to  .the radial road system were considered: to the proposed Mil in the Loughton/Chigwellarea; to the proposed Ml2 north of Romfordj and to tho A13 in. the Rainham area.2.7   The consideration of possible routes for the high-speed rail link betweenKingJs Cross and the Ml6 has yet to be completed.   But it is clear that the identification of a common corridor for further design work between the Ml6 and Maplin will leave open for decision at a later date a choice of rail routes from the Ml 6 area to the approaches to tho proposed rail terminal at King&apos;s Cross.   In order to minimithe effect on property, investigations into the route for the rail link west of theMl6 will take full account of the possibility of using tunnels where it passes throuthe built-up areas, - .
LINKS TO OTHER PARTS OF TIE CCUNTIir2.8   It is also - necessary for tho motorway to      &apos;. provide convenient links to otherparts of the country.   By linking into tho Ml6 it will enable traffic going north-wards to reach the Al,      and beyond; and southwards to tho Dartford Tunnel, the M20and tho Channel.   Further, feasibility studios are - now being carried out into thoapossibilities in the longer-term of a Lower Thames Crossing and a link between them and the M11, taking&apos; .- aiccount of the need to develop further the links betweenMaplin and the rest of the country. -CORRIDOR OPTIONS2.9   In the light of the factors described above, tho consultants selected sixifeasible corridors for assessment.   These are illustrated on the maps at Figs 1 and 2,The distance from the M16 to the airport varies between about 26 and 3k miles.From north to south the corridoi*s are:- -Corridor A would leave the Ml 1 in the area to the east of Loughton and cross the Ml6 in the Passingford Bridge area.   It would then head north-east, overthe River Roding, and turn east to cross the A12 between Ingatestone and.Maz^garetting, through Galleywood Common (south of Chelmsford) and run eastwardstowards the A130.   The corridor would pass to the north of South Vfoodham Ferrersand continue along the north side of the River Crouch, crossing that river atBridgemarsh Island, and the River Roach near VJallasea Island to reach the airportin the vicinity of Havengore Island.   On corridors A, B, C and D interchangescould be provided with M16, A12 and A130.Corridor B would follow corridor A as far as the Ml 6 in the Passingford Bridgearea, and then turn south-east to join corridor C in the Nave stock area, and thence to Maplin.Corridor G would leave the Ml 2 in the area east of Chigwell cross Ml 6 run north-east to the Navestock area, and then turn east to cross the A12 between Brentwoodand Mountnessing.   It would pass between Billcricay   and Stock and to the southof Hanningfield Water, before crossing the A130.   It would then run south of
Hullbridgo and north of Kockley, and along the south side of the River Crouchto the north of Canewdon to join corridor A in the vicinity of Wallasea Island.Corridor D would leave the M12 in the same area as corridor C but would turnsouth east along the M16 corridor.   Corridor D would diverge from the Ml6 inthe Great Warley area and turn east.   Here the high-speed rail link would proceed separately in a tunnel to overcome problems caused by the topography,The common corridor would then run just north of the A127, passing betweenBasildon and Wickford, before crossing the A130 and passing between Rayleighand Hockley to Southond Airport and thence to Maplin.   In the Rayleigh area therailway would again diverge from the motorway to follow an alignment   in tunnelthrough the high ground. &quot;Corridor E would leave the A13 west of Rainham and run north east to join corridorD to the west of Basildon.   There could be an interchange with the Ml6 to thesouth-east of TJpminster.   The rail link would follow the same alignment as forcorridor D for the reasons given below,Cor.rJ.dor F would follow corridor E from the A13 to the south of Upminster but have   a more southerly interchange with the M16.   From there it would headeast to the north of Stanford-le-Hope,   Because there arc clear difficulties incorridor west of Rainham, the railway must pass &quot;through the Great Warley gapas for corridor D to join the motorway north of Stanford-le-Hopo.   The combinedcorridor would than run north of Canvey Island across Hadleigh Marsh.   from there it would pass along the foreshore at Southend-on-Sea on a reclaimeddirectly from thpprcaches to the A13embankment about -g- mile out to sea from the present sea front, and turn north-east at Shoeburyncss to reach the ai:rport.
Hullbridgc and north of Kockley, and along the south side of the River Crouchto the north of Canewdon to join corridor A in the vicinity of Wallasea Island.Corridor D would leave the M12 in the same area as corridor C but would turnsouth east along the M16 corridor.   Corridor D would diverge from the Ml6 inthe Great Warley area and turn east.   Here the high-speed rail link would proceed separately in a tunnel to overcome problems caused by the topography.The common corridor would then run just north of the A12?, passing betweenBasildon and Wickford, before crossing the A130 and passing between Rayleighand Hockley to Southend Airport and thence to Maplin.   In tho Rayleigh area therailway would again diverge from the motorway to follow an alignment   in tunnelthrough tho high ground. . *Corridor E would leave the A13 west of Rainham and run north east to join corridorD to the west of Basildon.   There could be an interchange with the Ml6 to thesouth-east of Upminster.   The rail link would follow the same alignment as forcorridor D for the reasons given below.Corridor F would follow corridor E from the A13 to the south of Upminster but have   a more southerly interchange with the Ml 6.

Tho combinedcorridor would then run north of Canvey Island across Hadleigh Marsh.   from there it would pass along the foreshore at Southend-on-Sea on a reclaimedembankment about % mile out to sea from the present sea front, and turn north-east at Shoeburyneso to reach the airport.

CHAPTER 3ASSESSMENT OF ALTERNATIVE CORRIDORSROAD TRAFFIC3.1    The assessment of the traffic flows for corridor comparison was based on predictions for when the two-runway airport reaches maximumwoi&apos;king levels.   As well as the forecasts of the numbers of air passengers and business and other visitors to the airport   travelling by road, thegeneral traffic growth in South Essex and new traffic generated by possiblenew urban areas were assessed.   Taking into account potential interchangeswith the general purpose road network, the corridors tlirough the middle ofthe study area were generally considered more attractive to through trafficgoing direct to the airport and would provide more relief to the existing roadnetwork than those towards the edges of the area studied.3.2    Travel costs to road users (ie vehicle operating costs, journey timeand accident costs) on the road network of the area  were assessed for thevarious corridors.   The differences in these costs were not significant,though corridors C and D were marginally better than the others,ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS - - -3.3    In assessing the alternative corridors the impact on local communitieswas given special importance.   In this part of South Essex the pattern of settlement makes it possible to devise corridors which avoid most of the more heavily populated areas.   The effect of the various corridors on housing,the intrusion caused by traffic noise and on amenity and nature conservationhave nevertheless been measured and carefully considered in comparingalternative corridors.3.U    Although no detailed engineering designs have been prepared, thenumber of houses likely to be affected by a route in each of the corridors ha3
been assessed on the basis of the 100 yard wide band which would allow forthe motorway and high speed rail link (Para 2.1), Table 1 below shows tholikely impact of each of the corridors from the 20.6 to Maplin,TABLE 1 - POSSIBLE NUMBER OF HOUSES TO BS ACQUIREDCorridor	Possible number of houses to be acquired tA	Less than ICO housesB	Less than 100 housesC	Less than 100 housesD	Less than 150 housesE	Less than 15&apos;0 &quot;nousesF	Less than 50 houses3.5*    Generally the impact on housing is at a very low level indeed for sucha major motorway/rail project over some 30 miles in South East England,When comparing the different corridors, it should be remembered that corridor&quot;F, with the lowest effect on housing, would run for nearly half its lengthoffshore on a reclaimed embankment perhaps ^ mile out to sea, while corridors .D and E would pass closer to built-up areas than the other corridors,3.6    The effect of traffic intrusion on properties adjacent to the corridorswas also considered, although tho local impact can and will be reducedlandscaping and otherconsiderably by/comparatively minor modifications at the detailed designstages.   The effect of the intrusion was assessed on the basis of two zones:an inner zone, broadly equivalent to the 70 dBA noise level v/hich was featuredin the report of the Urban Motorways Committee-, and an outer zone where thonoise level might be only about one third of this.* &quot;New Roads in Towns&quot;, Published July 1972

It must be emphasised that this is only a comparative assessment toenable the alternative corridors to be evaluated..   Every ..&quot; effort will bemade at the detailed design stage to minimise the visual and noise intrusionof the particular route which is selected.IMPACT ON AMENITY AREAS AND NATURE CONSERVATION3.8 Corridor A would have considerable impact in the area north of Brentwoodand Ingatestone, and v/ould also affect Galleywood Common, south of Chelmsford.;It would intrude into the landscape of the Crouch and lower Roach Valleys, v/ithcrossings of both rivers. But it would not involve any bridging of the Crouchthat would interfere with yachting in the stretch of water below the    iconfluence of the Roach with the Crouch, or indeed with the water immediatelyupstream of this area.- - .       ..        &apos; - --    -3.9    Corridors B and C would affect the Navestock Common, Ramsden Heath(north-east of Billericay), and Hanningfield Water areas as well as theCrouch Valley,   A crossing of the river Roach as for Corridor A would alsobe involved,3.10    Corridor D would add to the width of the Ml6 corridor between the M12and Great Warley and Corridors D and E would affect the Hockley Ridge andHockiey Woods areas,3.11    Corridor F would have considerable environmental impact, affectingBenfleet Creek and Hadleigh Marshes and the area of the proposed HadleighCastle Country Park.   It would also pass on an embankment across theSouthend-on-Ssa foreshore perhaps    mile from the sea front.
RELATIONSHIP WITH PROPOSED HEW TOWN DESIGNATION area.12    Corridors A and F would run to the north and south respectively of .the area proposed for designation for development under the Hew Towns Actand consequently would not affect the area.   But they would bo less suitablefor assissting traffic movement to and from, the Hew Town.   Corridors D and Ewould run through the middle of this area and in particular would affect the potential of the Hockley Ridge/Hockley Wood area for recreational purposes.Corridors B and C would generally pass to the north of the proposed mainurban development.SOILS AND GEOLOGY3.13 These aspects played little part in the comparative evaluations, bubthe corridors to the north of the area (ie Corridors A, B and C) would pass through greater lengths of the soils stx-ata Claygate Beds and Bags hot Sandswhich could prove troublesome during construction, In the eastern sectionsthese corridors would cross soft alluvium deposits on the marshlands, whichwould increase construction costs on this sector, Corridor F in crossing the southern marshland and creeks and the Southend foreshore could also giverise to construction difficulties.COMPARATIVE NETWORK COSTS3.1U    In order to make a meaningful comparison between the alternativecorridor in capital cost terms, it was necessary as well as costing the mainsections between the 1Q.6 and Maplin to make some allowance for the differentcosts which would arise west of the ML6, with the different entry corridorsas far as the North Circular Road.   For example some allowance for posssibleextra capacity needed on the Mil was included in the costs for CorridorsA and B.   For Corridors C and D the full costs of an M12 in the new circumstances where it would form part of the Maplin mo ton-fay has been included.
For Corridors E and F an allowance has been made for improvements in the A13corridor west of Rainhara.   It lias been assumed that with Corridors A, B,&quot; Eand F a road in the 2112 corridor would still be required as a relief for theA12 and costs for this have been included for these corridors.3.15    As the routs of the railway between Kings Cross and the 1-0.6 is beingconsidered separately (see para 1.8) the costs of the rail link have only been estimated as far west as the 1-0.6.   The railway route options west of theMl6 are not expected to affect the overall corridor comparison between the 10.and Maplin.   Allowance has also been made for the cost implications of thoseparate motorway and rail link alignments where these occur, on routes D,E and F.3.16    The follox/ing table shows the estimated order of costs for each of thealternative corridors, on the basis described above.TABLE 3 - COMPARATIVE NETWORK COST  millions (1973 prices)Corridor	Motorway Costs Maplin to London (North Circular Road)	Railway Costs Maplin to ML6	Total Comparative Cost&quot;- A	80   .	&apos; 35	115B	80	-30	110C	65&apos;	30	95D	60	.    35	95.

RKCHAPTER h COMPARISON OF ALTERNATIVE CORRIDORSU.1   Corridor A v/ould affect fewer homes than any other corridor except F, bubcorridor A v/ould be the longest route and would be too far north to be attractive to through traffic, particularly that comming from south of the Thames.   also it would not provide a convenient link to the New Town, and it would bring leastrelief to the existing roads in and around Southend.   It would be environmentallydamaging in the area north of Brentwocd and Ingatestone and also in the Crouchand Roah Valleys, where both rivers would need to be crossed.   -U,2   Corridors A and B v/ould present difficulties at their entry to London via the Ml 1, because additional traffic capacity would be needed on the Ml 1 and aninterchange would have to be constructed near Loughton.   A route in the Ml 2corridor further south v/ould still be required to relieve the A12.k*3   Corridor C linking into the present proposed alignment of the M12would have the advantage of providing a suitable route for Maplin trafficinto London without the need to provide an additional route west of Ml 6 whichwould cause further intrusion.   The proposed Ml 2 corridor would be able tocater for both Maplin and A12 traffic.   Corridor C would be attractive tothrough traffic whilst at the same time providing relief to the existing roadnetwork.   It also has a low comparative cost.   The effects of the corridor on housing and amenity areas would be about the average for the six alternativecorridors, although Navestock Common, Ramsden Heath and the HanningfieldWater areas would be affected and a crossing of the River Roach would boreqitired.   Corridor C would generally skirt to the north of the proposed New   -Town and not intrude upon it.
U.U  Corridors D and E would cause the greatest Intrusion on existinghousing, and would pass through the middle of the area proposed fordesignation for the New Town.   Corridor D would be the best route from the traffic point of view and has a low comparative cost.   Corridor E wouldhave the least effect on areas of amenity value, but would have the disadvantage of entry to London via the AT 3 corridor which is already heavilycongested inside Ml 6 and has only very limited scope for improvement on itspresent alignment and would not be very attractive for traffic between Londonand Maplin.   On Corridor D the high-speed rail link would run on a separatealignment from the motorway, partly in tunnel in the Great War ley area.   Thorail link in Corridors D and E would also run separately from the motorway inin the Rayleigh area for the same reason,k,5   Corridor F, like corridor E would have the drawback of entry into Londonvia the A13, and would be too far to the south to be attractive to throughtraffic or to give much relief to the existing road network.   Corridor Fwould have the least effect on housing, but would have severe disadvantages .from the amenity point of view, particularly where it would run on a reclaimedembankment along the Southend-on-Sea foreshore, where it would cross the areaof the proposed Hadleigh Castle Country Park, and where it would affectEenfleet Creek and Hadleigh Marshes,   The high speed rail link would have toleave the motorway north of Stanford-le-Hope and turn north-west to joinCorridor D for the approach to Kings Cross, because it does not seem feasible to bring the rail rciite into London on the A13 alignment.
CiiAFTER 5&quot;CONCLUSIONCONSULTANTS1 RECOMMENDATIONS5*.1   Tho Departments consultants concluded from their study the Corridor Coffered the best overall solution.   The main advanbages of this corridorwould be:-i.   the motorway and high-speed rail link cou3.d be accommodated in thesame corridor throughout bebween Ml 6 and Maplin without the need for a.   separate alignment, thus reducing environmental intrusion to a minimum,. ii.   it is one of the corridors which would cause least overall enyiromentalintrusion to both houses and amenity areas,iii. it would not interdere seriously with the recreational facilities of the Rivers Crouch and Roach,iv. it has a low comparative overall cost;v. it would integrate satisfactorily with the proposals for the suggesteddesignation of an area for development under the New Towns Actjvi. it would provide a satisfactory connection with the Greater londonroad network via M12.P05SI3L3 ALTERNATIVE ALIGNMENTS TO THE PREFERRED CORRIDOR5&quot;.2 The consultants also considered two variations along part of this preferredcorridor and. these are discussed below. (They are also possible variations to -Corridor B as the 2 corridors are common along tliis length). Corridor B and Ctowards their eastern end would run of south of Hullbridgo and north of Conewdonbut feasible alternatives exist in this area both to the north of Hullbridgo andto the south of Canowdon,   These are shown on the maps at Fig.2 as unshaded dots.
5.3   Tho first alternative would leave the preferred corridor south ofHannigfield Water and pass between Hullbridgc and South Woodham Ferrers.Because of the need to bridge the River Crouch, long approach embankmentsacross the low-lying marshland on each side would be required.   The westernapproach to this bridge v;ould pass very close to the suggested new development at South Woodham Ferrers and would cause severe intrusion in this   area.   Thusthis alternative would involve more severe environmental impact and highercapital cost compared with the main corridor.5j.Ii   The other alternative alignment would run to the south of Canewdon,rather than to the north, to reach the airport by passing to the north-east of Great Wakering.   Although this alternative would be somewhat shorter andconsultants-&apos;cheaper then the/proferred corridor and would avoid the present Ministry ofDefence establishment on Potton Island, it would have an intrusive effect on -more existing houses,   It could also restrict the possiblilities for development. in the area proposed for designation as the New Town.EIs&quot;(K)V3BKHa^?,&quot;s&apos; VIEWS ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS - \5.5   The Government have considered the consultant?1 recommendations.   as yet they have reached no decision.   They are inclined to the view thatcorridor C (with or without either of the alternatives described at the easternend) would provide the best route.   Before deciding on the &quot;preferred corridorfor detailed planning the Government will take full account of views-.-z-.received on this document. &apos; &apos;-
