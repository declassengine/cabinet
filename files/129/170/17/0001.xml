THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government cp(73) 77 COPY no July 1973CABINETTHE LEVY ON INDEPENDENT TELEVISIONMemorandum by the Minister of Po3ts and Telecommunications1. At their meeting on 17 April the Ministerial Committee on broadcasting concluded that there were strong reasons for changing thepresent form of levy on the independent television companies.    TheCommittee invited me to bring forward proposals about a new formula which would take account of the arrangements already evolved for independent local radio.    The Committee accepted at that time the levyshould be increased so long as this was linked with the prospect of a newformula.    In my memorandum to the Committee I brought forward proposalsfor a non-statutory method of arranging a second tier rental, for an interim period until legislation could be introduced, but the Law Officers are not satisfied that the Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA) has power toenter into arrangements with the programme contractors for the paymentof a second tier rental.    Further, and in any event, it does appear to themthat the IBA has no power to make the monthly payments to the Exchequercontemplated in the proposals.2.        The alternative proposals in my paper are now put forward for the cabinet&apos;s endorsement and consist of an increase in the existing revenuebased levy, coupled with an undertaking to introduce legislation as soon aspossible giving effect to a profits based levy, in the form of a second tierrental.3. The increase proposed in the existing levy is intended to raise afurther  12 million (approximately) in addition to the  23 million which anunchanged levy is expected to yield over 1973-74.    The problems associatedwith an increase raised in this way, namely, the heavy impact on lessprofitable companies, and the general likely cut back in expenditure on future programmes by the companies as a whole, have not been overcome.It is held, however, that if the prospect of a change to a new system isoffered, the companies will accept the position.    They have had two yearsof high profits, and it is clearly not acceptable in a period of incomesrestraint that this should continue.    It will be necessary to lay an Orderby 16 July which has to be approved by both Houses, if the increase is to be effective by the end of July and we are not to let pass untouched a further three months profits.1
4.        The undertaking to introduce new arrangements for raising the levywhen legislative opportunity permits will require careful handling.    Thelegislation to extend the Authority beyond July 1976 (when existing legislation lapses) did not find a place in next year&apos;s programme.    It is unlikely therefore that time can be found for a Bill to introduce a profitsbased levy.    The most likely outcome is that the legislation required toextend the Authority may include legislation for a profit based levy.    Thiswould not be before 1974-75 Session; it might fall into 1975-76 though thiswould offer some dangers in terms of the proximity of July 1976, when theIBAJs current statute lapses.5.        In these circumstances the content of the undertaking for legislationso far ahead should not be too specific.    At that time more will be known about the impact of sound radio and the future of the fourth channel, andthere may be other factors to take into account.    I recommend therefore that I should simply accept in principle the case for introducing a second tierrental related to profits in substitution for the present arrangements, andto suggest a timetable which takes advantage of the first opportunityafforded by the legislative programme after the 1973-74 Session.    while this may not be regarded as sufficiently specific by the companies, I do not see that it is practicable to say more at this stage.6.        I invite the Cabinet to agree that I should:a. lay an Order increasing the rate of the present levy to yield approximately an additional  12 million in 1973-74;b. give, at the same time, an undertaking to introduce legislation, when time permits, to substitute for the present levya second tier rental related to profits.J EIMinistry of Posts and Telecommunications9 July 19732
