We all wish to restoreto the Fair Trading Bill the provision, which we lost in Committee,exempting the professions from the scope of the Restrictive PracticesCourt and the Consumer Protection Advisory Committee.    This shouldbe done at Report Stage in the House of Commons which is being taken next week.    If we cannot announce some references very soon it may prejudice our chances of doing so, although we are not all of one mind as to the degreof risk involved.    We are, however, agreed that the monopolies commission is the proper body to deal with professional restrictions and the problem is which ones, if any, to select for reference now.2. The proposals of thf Minister for Trade and Consumer affairs were to refer a. architects1 scale fees and b. certain practices of thelegal profession ie the two-counsel rule and the ban on partnerships atthe Bar and (when the Fair Trading Bill is law) restrictions on advertisingby solicitors.    Alternatively he would be prepared to see a referenceextended to cover all the practices of architects and of the Bar togetherwith a reference of restrictions on advertising by a number of professions.3. The Minister for Housing and Construction would be prepared toaccept a. The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officers were strongly opposed to b. or to any reference specifically pinpointing a practiceconfined to the Bar.4. The Minister for Trade and Consumer Affairs regards the inclusionof some major characteristic practices of the legal professions asindispensable to any meaningful reference.    On the other hand, theLord Chancellor and the Law Officers are doubtful of the need for any immediate professional references and would regard any reference ofpractices peculiar to the Bar as particularly untimely and politicallyobjectionable.

5.        There would seem to be two alternative approaches.    One,favoured by the Minister for Trade and Consumer Affairs, is set outin paragraph 2 abovs and might in his view be le3s open to the objection that the references were specifically directed at the legal profession andarchitects if there were also references of advertising restrictions incertain other professions viz accountants, stockbrokers, veterinarysurgeons.6. The other alternative, favoured by the Lord Chancellor and theLaw Officers and excluding references of any practices peculiar to the bar, would be:-i. to refer to the Commission scale charges by some other professions as well as architects eg surveyors;ii. to refer to the Commission restrictions on advertising bya number of professions including accountants, stockbrokers,veterinary surgeons, solicitors (when possible) and the Bar and. to announce that we intend to discuss with the Law Societythe possibility of improving the machinery for dealing withcomplaints against solicitors.7.        The health professions are not proposed for reference as thereare strong objections to referring them at the prssent time.8.        I invite my colleagues to consider what should be the content ofany references of professional restrictive practices which are to be madeto the Monopolies Commission.R home Office9 May 1973
