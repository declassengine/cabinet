THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 government cp(73) 80 COPY NO16 July 1973 66CABINETLATE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HOUSING FINANCE act memorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment the PROBLEML I have been asked to lay before my coDjeagues at this stage a problem which may require legislation next Session,    It arises fromthe deliberate failure of about 15 English local authorities (there were also five in Wales) to implement on time the rent increases due inOctober 1972 under the Housing Finance Act,    A provisional list ofthe English authorities is in tho Annex,    These authorities thus incurreda loss of income due to them.2.        District Auditors have a duty to surcharge the amount of any loss or deficiency upon any person, eg a councillor, by whose negligence ormisconduct it has occurred.    If the loss is over  500, as it will be for most of the authorities in question, the person is disqualified from membership of a local authority (including any of the new authorities)for five years.    There is a provision for appeal to the High Court, orto the Secretary of State in respect of surcharges up to  500.3.        So far only one case of surcharge has arisen, at Clay Cross urban district (UD),    This was the result of an extraordinary audit.    Thepossibility of surcharge will not arise for the other authorities untilthe ordinary audit in the autumn or winter.    The District Auditor isan independent official with statutory duties whose decisions dependon his view of each case at audit.    Thus the likely scale of surchargecan only be estimated.    But probably some 200 councillors might besurcharged and disqualified and there will be no good grounds for theCourt or the Secretary of State to allow an appeal against surcharge orto afford any relief.    Any kind of amnesty would require legislation.THE CASE FOR AND AGAINST AN AMNESTY4. Widespread surcharge and disqualification will increase oppositionto the Act, and many people might regard them as too harsh a punishment for a delay of only a few months in swallowing a politically bitter pill.    The
penalty will not be graded according to the degree of obduracy, ie an authority with many houses which was only a few weeks late will incurbigger losses per surcharged councillor than an authority with few houses which was several months late,5. On the other hand, the surcharged councillors will have acted infull knowledge of the possible results.    To relieve them of the due legalconsequences would set a disquieting precedent and seem unfair to thosecouncillors who were opposed to the Act but whose respect of law led themto implement it on time.6. Many rents still need to be increased to reach fair rents.    Anyamnesty might cause some councillors to feel that they could postpone the October 1973 round and get away with it.SUBSIDY7. There is also a subsidy point.    Under the Act broadly 90 per cent of a deficit in the Housing Revenue Account for 1972-73 is made up by theExchequer,    Quite undeservedly, the laggard authorities have increased their entitlement.    If they choose to claim it, I have no certain power to withhold it.    Such a result would invite comment.    It could not be prevented without legislation.THE CHOICE8.        I consider that only two broad courses are open to U3:-1. To let the law take its course: surcharge, appeal - usuallyto the High Court - recovery of the money (as far as possible),disqualification.2.        Legislation to empower us to grant an amnesty in respectof 1972-73 only, with a view to using the power in the case of those authorities who did not carry their obduracy beyond a certain point:the power might be so limited as to apply only to the excess in the surchange over a prescribed figure - say  100 per councillor.conclusion. My provisional preference is for the second course but not to use the amnesty power for those authorities against whom a default order hadto be made and who did not then comply within the period specified in theorder.    This would leave to be surchagred (in England) only councillorsof Camden, Clay Cross UD and Conisbrough UD.    But we do not need todecide this matter finally until October when the statutory preliminariesfor the relevant audits begin.   I beHeve that the decision should be takenin the light of our progress with Stage 3 and the implementation of the october 1973 rent increases.   If we were to decide on an amnesty, I would strongly advise against annnouncing it until the October 1973 increases are substantially implemented.G r department of the Environment16 July 1973
