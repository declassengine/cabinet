THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 67 COPY NO       6 ^11 June 1973CABINETREGIONAL DEVELOPMENT GRANTS - SLAUGHTERHOUSESMemorandum, by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary ofState for Wales and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food. The Ministerial Committee on Regional Policy and the Environmentat its meeting on 23 May considered, and on balance did not favour, our proposal for extending regional development grants (RDG) to slaughter-houses.    We were invited to give further consideration to the posabilityof assisting slaughterhouses from agricultural rather than regional development funds.    We have concluded that no suitable powers areavailable to us for this purpose.    Since we remain convinced that thereis a strong and exceptional case for extending RDG to slaughterhouses weinvite the Cabinet to consider the issues involved.2,        RDG under the Industry Act 1972 is an unselective form of aid paid on capital expenditure at premises used whoDly or mainly for mining,manufacturing and construction activities in the assisted areas.Slaughtering is not eligible because it is classified in the StandardIndustrial Classification under distributive trades.    During consultationsleading to the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which removed from local authorities the duty to secure the provision of adequateslaughtering facilities, representatives of the meat trade stressed the difficulties of finding capital for private enterprise to acquireslaughterhouses from local authorities or to develop new facilities.At that time expenditure on the construction and improvement of slaughter-houses in development and intermediate areas could qualify for buildinggrant under the Local Employment Act (LEA) and no difficulty wasforeseen about the continuation of this assistance.    However, LEAbuilding grants were superseded by the arrangements for RDG underthe Industry Act.    Since then strong representations have been made,and continue to be made, that slaughterhouses should attract RDG.3. The cost of paying RDG on slaughterhouses cannot be accuratelyforecast, but present indications suggest that, at the normal rate of 20 percent, it would run at about  200,000 per annum in relation to an estimated total expenditure of about  1 million per annum on new or extended privateslaughterhouses in the assisted areas of England, Wales and Scotland.1
Local authority slaughterhouses will be very largely excluded in accor-dance with the general policy of giving grants to local authorities only on buildings which they lease to an occupant in a qualifying capacity.4. Our case for bringing slautherhouses within the ambit of RDG(which would be effected by a Variation Order under the Industry Act)may be summarised as follows:a. The present classification of slaughterhouses underdistributive trades is based on the old-fashioned concept ofa slaughterhouse as a local facility provided for the use of retail butchers; modern facilities are increasingly of the&quot;meat factory&quot; type geared to meeting national and exportrequirements.    In Northern Ireland slaughtering attractsGovernment aid under an Industries Development Scheme;slaughterhouses on the Continent also generally attract nationalaids.    The European Economic Community (e.c.) includes amongstmanufacturing activities, in its statistical classification, theslaughtering, preparing and processing of meat (except thebutchers1 trade).    Slaughterhouses are eligible for e.c. aidas Individual Projects under the Communities1 AgriculturalGuidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA), provided that theyare also aided by the member State concerned under nationallegislation.b. The extension of RDG to slaughtering would ensure that future slaughterhouse developments were concentrated in the assisted areas and close to the livestock producing regions.Modern slaughterhouses attract processing plants and othersecondary inlustries and therefore offer valuable employmentprospects for development areas,c. More slaughterhouses up to the standards required forexport within the e.c. are required if the livestock industry into take full advantage of the growing export potential.    Further,only e.c. approved slaughterhouses may be used for interventionbuying which, now that the e.c. guide price for 1973-74 has been increased by 10. 5 per cent, is no longer such a remote possibility.At present a sufficient number of approved slaughterhouses islacking in a mmber of important production areas, eg in wales and parts of Scotland.d. It would be some defence against the continuing pressure to ban the export of live animals if the facilities for exporting meatin carcass form were being encouraged.5,        The main reason why the proposal was not accepted by theCommittee was that it did not appear to be consonant with the purposeof RDG which is intended broadly to divert to assisted areas enterpriseswhich have a choice of location.    It was felt that the natural tendencywould be for slaughterhouses to be sited in the livestock producing regions
without further inducement and that the proposal could not therefore bejustified on grounds of regional policy.    At the same time, there wasanxiety that the extension of RDG to slaughterhouses might make it difficultto resist pressures from other industries such as seed processings fishfilleting and tyre repairing to have RDG extended to them also    Both these points are matters of judgment.    But, in our view, the first is not borne out by the representations made by the trade and producers at the time ofthe Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill and subsequently, and thesecond should not militate against the inclusion of slaughtering, if seen tobe justified on wider grounds.6.        Concern was also expressed in the Committee about the difficultyof excluding from the definition of slaughtering ordinary wholesale and retail distribution activities,,    The practical choice lies between a definition, such as v.*e would prefer, which would include meat preparationif carried out on the same premises as slaughtering and one which would limit the qualifying activity to the traditional slaughtering process and exclude more refined preparation of the meat, eg into smaller cuts andwholesale containers.    Activities such as freezing, curing and themanufacture of meat products which are sometimes associated withslaughtering already qualify for RDG.7.        We invite our colleagues to agree that slaughterhouses shouldbe brought within the ambit of RDG by means of a Variation Order whichwould appropriately define the activity.G CP TJ GScottish Office11 June 1973
