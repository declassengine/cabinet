MENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY!S government cp(73) 6814 June 1973CABINETREFUSAL OF SUITABLE EMPLOYMENT 3Y THEUNEMPLOYEDMemorandum by the Secretary of State for employment. At the. meeting of the Cabinet on 3 May there was some discussionof labour shortages and it was argued that it was increasingly unreasonablethat unemployed workers should be able to define so narrowly the type and location of work which they were willing to accept that they could rejectwithout penalty employment which would be within their capacities andwould not involve any excessive daily journey.    Since the conditions governing refusal of suitable employment by claimants to unemploymentbenefit were due to be discussed by the Home and Social AffairsCommittee later in the month, I was asked to inform the Cabinet of the outcome of that discussion.2. The Committee discussed the question on 22 May against the background of a paper which I submitted on the role of the employmentservices in persuading unemployed persons to take suitable employment.They agreed that the employment service must keep a balance between itsnormal placing work - for which the co-operation of employers is vital -and placing action intended to put pressure on those who are reluctant totake suitable employment, which inevitably involves the risk that employers will find such people unsatisfactory.    They also noted theinfluence of National Insurance case law.    The Committee looked at anumber of more stringent measures which might be taken to put pressure on the unemployed.    They concluded that, although stronger action andpossibly new legislation might have to be contemplated at some suitable time, there was first a need to collect more evidence about the extentto which people remained unemployed without adequate cause under theexisting law and practice.3. The Committee therefore agreed with my proposal that I shouldcollect further information under two headings:-i.       An analysis of a sample of cases referred to theStatutory Authorities in order to ascertain and appraise thereasons why jobs were refused and the effect of decisions taken by the Statutory Authorities on whether benefit shouldbe allowed or not;copy NO      (jr.
ii.       An. analysis of a sample of the unemployed registersat local offices to ascertain why those who had been withoutwork or had only been securing casual employment for threemonths or more had not been found suitable jobs.I was also asked to see whether further information could be provided onthe incentive to work for paople receiving unemployment benefit; theextent to which people refuse the nationally agreed rate for a job becausethey have been receiving more than this in their previous employment;and the effect of the cost of travel, geographical mobility, and mobilitybetween industries on the pattern of job refusal.4. I am putting these analyses in hand as rapidly as possible.    Ishall be linking them in part with the sample survey of the chcsacteristicsof the unemployed which is being carried out in the next two months.    Ishall then report to the Home and Social Affairs Committee.M V MDepartment of Employment13 June 19732
