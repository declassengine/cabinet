THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(73)742 July 1973CABINETTHE CHANNEL TUNNEL PROJECTMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. We will need shortly to take a firm decision whether to go ahead with the next stage of the Channel Tunnel project and specifically to signAgreement No. 2 with the Companies and a Treaty with the French, andto embark on the initial Phase II works.2. The results of the extensive studies undertaken in Phase I arenow available.    We have all the material on which to take a decision whether or not the project is desirable, if acceptable terms can beobtained.IS A TUNNEL DESIRABLE ?3. Cross-Channel traffic has grown rapidly in recent years.Passenger traffic doubled between 1962 and 1970, and even though therate of growth is expected to slow down, the 24 million passengers and1. 5 million cars of 1971 may well reach 50 million and 3. 5 million by1980, and 98 million and 7 million by 1990.    Freight traffic is alsogrowing, particularly on certain routes.    The number of lorries passing through the port of Dover, with all that implies in the way of congestion and danger in the town and on the A2 approaches, increased by43 per cent last year.    The traffic is coming; we must provide for it.   ,4.        There are only two real options open.    We can continue to rely   ,on sea and air services and their development, including the provisionof the necessary shipping, aircraft, port facilities, roads, and so on -much at public expense.    Or we can supplement them with a Tunnel.This project has been under intensive examination for a decade inaccordance with the decisions of successive administrations.    the alternatives of bridges and bridge/tunnel combinations have been examined and rejected because of higher cost, interference withnavigation, and the fact that no such scheme could be developed in timeto help us with the problems of the 1980s.copy NO65
5. The results of the studies indicate that, on central assumptions,the Tunnel would: -a. pay ae a project, and on any acceptable terms would providea substantial inflow of funds to the Exchequer from tax and our share of the profits;b. be cheaper in the medium and longer term than tiealternatives;c. provide more reliable and in many cases faster services for travellers;d. provide the regions with improved through transport services for their goods without leading to any substantialnew concentration of development in the South-East as a wholeor South-East Kent in particular;e. give a real boost to British Railways;f. relieve the roads to the ports of a proportion of the growth in cross-Channel traffic (perhaps \ million lorry journeys a year -disregarding empty return trips 1);6.        Against this must be set:a. the damage that the Tunnel complex would cause to alimited area of South-East Kent (around 300 acres for theTunnel, plus 300 acres of new route for the railway);b. the fact that the Tunnel requires a very large &quot;lump&apos;investment between now and 1980 with very low costs thereafter,as opposed to the more gradual spread of the higher capital and operating cost of the alternative; andc. the consequent higher sensitivity of the Tunnel to variations in traffic and revenue, though it would take very pessimisticassumptions to reduce the return to our 10 per cent &quot;low risk&quot;standard, and if revenue were more buoyant than forecast,not to have built the Tunnel would prove extremely expensive.7. The full benefits of the Tunnel are only obtainable if a new high-quality rail link is provided.    The Ministerial Committee on economic policy agreed that if the Tunnel goes ahead such a link should beprovided at a cost of about  120 million.8.        If the Cabinet agree that the project is in principle desirable,there are two areas for further consideration.2
THE FINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONS9.        The terms proposed by the Companies are unacceptable.    TheMinister for Transport Industry^ French colleague agrees on this point.The two Ministers are discussing on 3 July the terms of our reply tothem, due by 7 July, which I am considering in consultation with theTreasury and my legal advisers.    I will report the latest positionafter that meeting.    It is not yet clear whether or net terms which Iwould be prepared to recommend will be available.    It is, however,clear that if we wish to abandon the project, a breakdown of thefinancial negotiations would be the least difficult way to do so.HANDLING AND PRESENTATION10.       We have promised an announcement this month if the decision is favourable, together with publication of the Money Bill.    While its passage can be delayed until October, there might be advantages in having a Second Reading debate before the recess.     The major HybridBill is already included in next year&apos;s legislative programme.11.      As soon as it is clear whether or not acceptable terms for financing are likely to be obtainable,   I will report back.    In themeantime, however, the preparation is in hand of a draft White paper and of a campaign to attract public and Parliamentary support forthe project between now and the Autumn.CONCLUSION12.       I invite the Cabinet to agree that:a. it would be right to go ahead at least with the next stageif acceptable terms can be negotiatied;b. if so, a high quality rail link should be provided;c. a decision should if possible be taken and announced,and the Money Bill published, this month.GRDepartment of the environment  July 19733
