THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 64 COPY NO      &quot;J6 June 1973CABINETROLE OF THE BUILDING SOCIETIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerla The group of Ministers under my chairmanship that has been considering fucure policy towards the building societies has reached thefollowing interim conclusions, which are set out in more detail in the annex to this memorandum.2. We have authorised the opening of discussions with the building societies Association (BSA) on two important long-term proposals -a. arrangements for stabilising the flow of xesidentialmorcgags funds;b. schemes for giving selective help to first time purchasersby reducing initial and increasing later mortgage repayments.preliminary discussions have already started on stabilisation and are about to begin on first time purchasers.    We shall be considering whatfinal recommendations to make to the Cabinet when these discussions havebeen taken further; and at that stage it will be possible to decide whethervoluntary arrangements will suffice or whether legislation will be required.3. The immediate problem is the action to be taken on the expiry ofthe present 3-month bridging grant.    Although building society receiptswere greatly improved in April and more recently, it is too soon to say whether the BSA will be able to recommend the maintenance of a mortgagerate of 9.5 per cent when the grant comes to an end in July,    If, however,they should find it necessary to increase the rate to 10 per cent we are agreed that there should be no continuance of a Government subsidy,though we believe that effective presentational steps could be taken tosoften the impact of a 10 per cent mortgage rate on our counter-inflationarypolicies.    As immediate short-term measures we propose -1
a. To set up informal consultative machinery with the BSAto monitor the flow of mortgage funds in advance of permanentstabilisation machinery.b. To seek the agreement of the BSA to the introduction ofmodel mortgage schemes for first time purchasers on a provisionalbasis by the autumn.4.        I invite the Cabinet to endorse the conclusions summarised inparagraph 3 of this memorandum, and to note that I shall be reporting tothem further on the matters referred to in paragraph 2.A treasury Chambers5 June 19732
CONFIDE NANNEXROLE OP THE BUILDING SOCIETIESIn accordance v;ith the decision of the Cabinet at their meeting on 5th April (CM(73)22nd Conclusions, Minute 7)a group of Ministers under my chairmanship (GEN 168) has met &quot;to consider in the short-term and in the long-term:a. The scope for action on the part of the building societies to maintain great er stability in the mortgagemarket;b. the need for greater Government supervision andcontrol of the financial activities of the building societies.&quot;2.     We thought it best to consider first what long-termarrangements we should aim far and then to what extent these arrangements could be applied to the situation arising onthe expiry of the 3-month bridging grant.Long-term measures3.     In the long-term, there are two major requirements which must be satisfied if we are to succeed in extending the area of owner occupation by promoting private building.First, there must be a steady flow of finance into the mortgage market, since this is the surest way of maintaining the confidence of builders, of ensuring the continuance ofa satisfactory level of house-building and of avoidingexcessive price increases.    Secondly, something must bedone to protect the most   vulnerable of those who are buyinga house for the first time against the effects of house pricescompounded by exceptionally high mortgage rates.4.     We have considered two possible schemes to smooth outthe damaging alternation between mortgage glut and mortgagefamine.    In both cases the building societies will be free to let their interest, rates vary flexibly in line with mortgagerates.    In addition one scheme would involved control of- 1 -
(confidential)the minimum liquidity ratios to be observed by the building societies, while under the other the Government, or perhaps a Mortgage Corporation, would be able to call in and releasedeposits as the Bank of England does for the clearing banks.Both schemes would be similar in their economic effects,and neither would require any Exchequer subsidy.    Thecontrol of building society interest rates for strictly limited periods could in principle be considered as anadjunct to either scheme.    We should like if possibleto avoid the complex and controversial legislation whicha compulsory scheme would require, and therefore have authorised informal discussions with the BSA to see ifa voluntary agreement can be achieved.    We shall reportagain on the discussions when they are further advanced;but at present the Department of the Environment  (DOE)think it likely that, as a minimum, we shall need somesatutory reserve powers to back up a &quot;voluntary&quot; scheme.5.     We have considered two main schemes for helping first time purchasers, both of which would be financed by thebuilding societies themselves -a.     There could be further extension of the &quot;lowstart&quot; mortgage schemes, under which a mortgagor&apos;sgross annual repayments start lower but finish higherthan under an orthodox annuity morgage.    The possiblityof a low start mortgage would be offered to any lowerincome first time purchaser to offset higher houseprices even if the mortgage rate fell to 8.5% or below.. b.     When the mortgage rate exceeds (say) 8.5% the societies could give an interest-reducing loan to reducethe amount of the interest payments due during the first few years of the mortgage.    The loan would be repaidon sale or on the expiry of the mortgage.    This scheme would be available to the generality of first time purchasers.The two schemes could be run concurrently.    The building societies have said that they are anxious to help, but itis by no means certain that they will co-operate becauseof the financial implications for their day to day operations.- 2 -(confidential)
(CONFIDENTIAL)They may, for example, ask for some sort of government guarantee. Discussions with the BSA on first time purchasersare about to start and we shall report again when theposition becomes clearer.Short-term measures6.      Two measures can be taken irrespective of interest rates:a. Informal consultative machinery can be set up with the BSA to monitor the flow of mortgage funds;and could pave the way towards permanent stabilisationmachinery on the lines discussed in paragraph *l above.b. Although the arrangements for first time purchasersdiscussed in paragraph 5 could not be fully introduced before 197^, we are exploring the possibility of introducing model mortgage schemes on a provisionalbasis by the autumn.7.      The BSA will decide early in July what their recommendedinvestment rates should be on the expiry of the bridginggrant.    Since early April, clearing bank deposit rates havefallen from 7s$to6l;$ and the net receipts of the building societies from shares and deposits have risen from  60m.in March to  196M. in April and are still running high (though aconsiderable part of this new inflow is apparently being used to restore liquidity).    It is however too soon to say whetherthe BSA will be able to recommend a reduction in the investmentrate to its pre-April level of 6.3$, but if it does, the mortgage rate can remain at 9-5$ and no further government intervention will be called for.8.      If, however, the BSA wished to maintain&quot; the investmentrate at 6.75$, and could not be dissuaded, an   early increasein the mortgage rate to 10$ would be inevitable unless wecould offer a further Government subsidy.    We do not howeverbelieve that the continuance of a subsidy would be thought to be justified, or compatible either with the statement thatwe made last April or with the credibility of our financialpolicies; and if the investment rate is maintained at 6.75$^     _- 5 -_(confidential)
we must therefore be prepared to see the mortage rate go up to 10JL9.     If this occurs, it would be very desirable that weshould be able to announce the intention to introduce in the near future a scheme, agreed with the BSA, forhelping first time purchasers - though in doing this weshould have to be careful not to put ourselves at a disadvantage in our negotiations with the societies,and to avoid promising more than we can deliver if theBSA are unwilling to co-operate.-  21  -
