PUBLIC ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE CENSUS ...in
SECURITY   OF  the census  OF   POPULATION1.  GOVERNMENT STATEMENTIntroduction1.1 Public disquiet about potential threats to the privacy of the individualcitizen led the Government in May 1970 to appoint the Committee onPrivacy under the chairmanship of the Right Hon. Kenneth Younger;the report was published in July 1972 as a Command Paper (Cmnd. 5012).One of the threats considered by the Committee was that posed by the increasing amount of data collection and use of computers. As thecommittee&apos;s review was confined to the private sector, the government also set up a group under the leadership of the Home Office to review the use of computers by government departments. This group made a comprehensive survey of the categories of personal information held orlikely to be held in the computer systems of government departments and of the rules governing its storage and use, and has made its report.The Government are studying both these reports and in due course theywill publish their conclusions.1.2 Because of the public concern about privacy the Government were glad to accept an offer by the British Computer Society (BCS) to review the census security arrangements, as announced by the Lord President ofthe Council in the House of Commons shortly before Census day 1971(Official Report, 19 April 1971, Col. 816). In response to an invitation from the census departments at about the same time the Royal StatisticalSociety (RSS) nominated three of its members to make an independentstudy. The reports of both these bodies were received by the two censusMinisters, the Secretary of State for Social Services and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, last September.1.3 The census departments and the Societies have always assumed that the societies&apos; findings would be published. The Societies agreed that theGovernment should decide the form of publication, and that it wouldomit anything that might be prejudicial to census security, but would include the Governments own conclusions.1.4 The Government are grateful to the two Societies and to the individual members for the time and thought they gave in the public interest totheir studies of census security arrangements, and for their reports.1.5 The Societies&apos; reports give no evidence to support misgivings about the potential threat to the individual from the use of computers for the census. However they both recommend that the census should be thesubject of independent reviews. The Government will consider these recommendations in the light of the decisions they make on the more general issues in the Report of the Younger Committee.1
Report by the BCS Panel1.6 The Government welcome the report by the BCS Panel on the arrange-ments for security of information for the 1971 Census and very muchappreciate the care with which the Society has assessed the situationwithin the census processing establishments and prepared its report.An agreed summary of the Report appears as section 2 of this White Paper.1.7 Although the information that is provided by the public at census timecould hardly affect the security of the realm, it is personal and confidential information. As such it demands and deserves a high level of protection.The Government recognise this requirement and the census operation is guided by it. They would not however be justified in introducingadditional security measures to deal with small residual risks if the costs of doing so were wholly disproportionate.1.8 In the 1971 Census all the data were converted to coded form and the names and addresses removed before entry into the computer system.These measures together with other safeguards (some of which cannot bepublished) make it virtually impossible to obtain information aboutidentifiable individuals from any computer record. Moreover it mustbe strongly emphasised that no information which can be related toidentifiable individuals or households is ever passed by the censusdepartments to anyone outside: whether to other government depart-ments, to local authorities or to private individuals, and whether bycomputer links or by any other means.1.9 The BCS report makes a number of criticisms of the security arrangements which the Panel found at the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys(OPCS) computer installation. On the other hand the report fails togive credit to the protection afforded by the unbroken tradition of censusconfidentiality which is faithfully maintained by the staff of the depart-ment, and indeed backed by statutory sanctions. So far as is knownpast security procedures have protected all the data collected.1.10 The report expresses satisfaction with the security arrangements forcensus processing in Scotland but makes two minor recommendations for improvements, of which one has been adopted and one rejectedafter consideration.1.11 The Government have taken careful account of all the Society&apos;s proposalsfor improvements in the security of census processing, including certain recommendations which, in the interest of maintaining security, theSociety and the Government have agreed should not be published.1.12 Since the members of the BCS visited OPCS in 1971, the physicalarrangements for security have been reinforced. OPCS is planning tointroduce a new computer operating system with more built-in securitysafeguards than exist under the present general-purpose operating system.1.13 The Society&apos;s report added impetus to the plans OPCS were making fora Computer Division. The new division, headed by an assistant secretary, was formally created in autumn 1972. It has already assumed responsibility for long-term planning, and it will shortly take over central control of systems-analysis, programming and systems-operation.  It!
will devise and introduce technical standards which will include securityprocedures for all computer systems. The head of the division hasoverall responsibility for security at the establishment where the OPCScomputer is located, and he will arrange for a full security survey to becarried out there covering both computer and non-computer aspects.1.14 The Society&apos;s report recommends (2.3.6) that there should be regularindependent monitoring of the operations at all census processingestablishments. The Government will willingly consider this. JJtfr/itwould not be right to come to a^BBd decision on the recommendationuntil the Government have decided what to do about the relevant partsof the Younger Report (which make general recommendations aboutcomputers handling personal data); and it would certainly be premature to design a system of external and independent checks on censusprocessing before the new computing organisation in OPCS, with itswide responsibilities for security, is in action.1.15 The Government recognise the contribution made by the British ComputerSociety to the vital subject of census security. They intend to maintain this security at a high level and to keep a continuous watch on the problem as circumstances and technology change.Report by the RSS Nominees1.16 The Government welcome the report by the RSS nominees on the securityof information for the 1971 Census and they appreciate the care thatwas taken. The: report concentrates on security during the collectionstages and on the risk of disclosure of information about individualsthrough the published statistics. There is nothing that could compromisecensus security in the. report and it is therefore given in full in section 3of this White Paper. The Government conclusions on each of thereport&apos;s eleven recommendations are set out in section 4.1.17 Section 5 sets out the available evidence on public attitudes towards the census, since both Societies took these as a starting point for their investigations.2. REPORT OF THE BRITISH COMPUTER SOCIETY ON THEARRANGEMENTS FOR THE SECURITY OF INFORMATION FORTHE 1971 CENSUS2.1 History2.1.1 In April 1971, considerable public disquiet was voiced about thepossibility of leakages of personal information as a result of thecollection, recording, processing and use of data for the 1971Census. On 14 April Mr. Jeremy Thorpe, mp, made a speech which was widely reported in which he suggested that to reassure the public the Government should invite an independent body,such as the British Computer Society, to examine the generalprocedures to be followed.3
2.1.2 On 16 April, 1971 the then President, Mr. D&apos;Agapeyeff, met the deputy Director of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveysand indicated that the Society was prepared to undertake an appraisal of the security of the computer system to be used forthe 1971 Census.2.1.3 On 19 April Mr. William Whitelaw, Leader of the House ofCommons, stated that &quot; the Census Office will gladly accept an offer made by the British Computer Society to discuss with it thearrangements for security, and the same will apply to any other body &quot;.2.1.4 As a consequence the Royal Statistical Society was invited by the census Offices to participate in the discussions in the terms ofthe Lord Presidents statement, and will be presenting a separate report.2.1.5 At a joint meeting of the Office of Population Censuses and surveys, the General Register Office for Scotland, the BritishComputer Society and the Royal Statistical Society on 4 May,1971 the broad areas of study for each body were discussed. TheBritish Computer Society undertook to carry out an examinationof the computer aspects in general and the two computerinstallations concerned in particular.2.1.6 The Society now presents its Report which comprises the following sections:1.   History2.   Examination of security procedures3.  Conclusions and recommendations.1.7 The British Computer Society desires to place on record itsappreciation of the co-operation and of the facilities made availableto them on their visits to Titchfield and Edinburgh.2.1.8 The representatives of the British Computer Society concerned inthe detailed study were:M.

2.1.2 On 16 April, 1971 the then President, Mr. DWgapeyefl&apos;, met the deputy Director of the Office of Population Censuses and Surveysand indicated that the Society was prepared to undertake an appraisal of the security of the computer system to be used forthe 1971 Census.2.1.3 On 19 April Mr. William Whitelaw, Leader of the House ofCommons, stated that &quot; the Census Office will gladly accept an offer made by the British Computer Society to discuss with it thearrangements for security, and the same will apply to any other body &quot;.2.1.4 As a consequence the Royal Statistical Society was invited by the census Offices to participate in the discussions in the terms ofthe Lord Presidents statement, and will be presenting a separate report.2.1.5 At a joint meeting of the Office of Population Censuses and surveys, the General Register Office for Scotland, the BritishComputer Society and the Royal Statistical Society on 4 May,1971 the broad areas of study for each body were discussed.

2.2.2 The issues that were raised in the Debate allow for differentinterpretations. Whilst appreciative of the fact that purelydepartmental requirements might be satisfied by a somewhatspecialised interpretation the Society, after close study, believes that on balance a wider view offers more general benefits in thepublic interest and is justifiable from the text of the Debate.2.2.3 The Panel felt that it could best fulfil its responsibilities by an appraisal of the total security environment of the processingstage.2.2.4 Within this broad interpretation the Society laid down for itselfcertain specific inclusions and exclusions.2.2.5    It did not consider it its duty to include the following:(a) determination of or comment upon the value of theinformation which could be derived from the census data;(b) assessment of the degree of sensitivity of that information inrelation to any right of the individual to privacy.2.2.6 Nevertheless, for the purpose of its investigation the Panelassumed the census data to be sufficiently sensitive to rate protection against unauthorised access to and use of the information.2.2.7 The Panel considered that it had therefore a clear duty to ascertainand comment upon the measures adopted to minimize the risks of such unauthorised access and use.2.2.8 The Panel also believed that it had to consider the abuses that were possible rather than probable and that for this purposepotential abuses of both deliberate and accidental nature must be examined. It is felt that in both the design and the assessment of security systems and procedures it is the possibilities whichprimarily require examination since consideration of the prob-abilities alone could lead to vulnerable areas in the overall security.The probabilities in any case are, by their nature, a sub-group ofthe possibilities.2.2.9   The Panel sought evidence, in particular, that adequate protectionwas afforded against the following possibilities:(a) deliberate damage to the computer installation, or computercensus records, for whatever motive;(6) identification of individuals from the Census Office computerfiles;(c) deliberate or accidential corruption of data either before, or after entry on the Main Census File;(d) unauthorised retrieval and/or removal of census information in any form.2.2.10 The comments made below are based on:(a) the observations of the BCS Panel in the English and Scottishsections;(6) the documentation provided by the offices of the RegistrarsGeneral;(c) additional documentation either provided, or made availablefor examination, by the staffs in England and Scotland.5
Organisational differences2.2.11 It is important to appreciate that there are radical differences between the data processing activities of the English and Scottishsections of the Census Office operation.(a) The English section is responsible for all aspects of processingcensus data, and for storing census records.(b) The Scottish section is at present concerned only withtranscribing (and in the process omitting name and addressfrom) about half the original census schedules, first topunched cards and then to magnetic tape in an uncheckedform. These tapes are then sent by surface transport toEngland for all further processing.(r) Though the current operation in Scotland is therefore limited in scope, the possibility exists that some post mainstreamprocessing may ultimately occur there.(d) An important distinction should be noted which is that theScottish Office Computer Service (SOCS), where the data onpunched cards is transferred to magnetic tape, is not directly under the control of the Registrar General for Scotland. Itis, however, part of the Scottish Office and thus under thecontrol of the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Ministerto whom the Registrar General for Scotland is responsible.2.2.12 These differences directly influence both attitudes and operations,and derived from the fact that:(a) the English section is virtually a &quot; dedicated &quot; installation,with both data preparation and processing concentrated inthe hands of the OPCS;(b) in the Scottish -Section, data preparation is in the hands ofthe Census Office who then avail themselves of the &quot; bureau &quot;services provided by SOCS to have the data converted frompunched cards to magnetic tape.2.2.13 As implied in paragraph 2.2.9 (a) above, the Panel considered thepossibility that individuals exist who, for various motives, might seek to discredit, or physically hamper, the operation of the censusby wilful destruction or damage to the computer installations orto the computer census records.2.2.14 To provide some protection against this eventuality some form of physical protection of the census processing establishments isessential.2.2.15 Physical security within the &quot; sensitive &quot; areas is considered more appropriately under Security in the Computer Environment.Physical security in the English and Scottish sections2.2.16 The Panel considered that there were weaknesses in the Englishsection in the physical security system outlined in paragraph 2.2.above. Detailed observations were made regarding these and appropriate recommendations made to the Registrar General.6
2.2.17 The physical security problem in the Scottish Section involves twoorganisations with, in addition, the physical movement of censusrecords in one form or another.2.2.18 The data preparation section is an office of the Census Branchunder the control of the Registrar General for Scotland. on completion of the punching operation cards are transported to the computer facilities for further processing.2.2.19 The Panel considered that the physical security arrangements inScotland were adequate and this was solely the result of correctmanagerial appreciation of the threat and correct application ofmanagerial solutions to the problems which the threat poses. Theydrew the attention of the Registrar General for Scotland to twominor points on which they thought improvement might be made.Corruption of data2.2.20 Controls at stages before the schedules arrive in the Scottish and english sections were separately considered by the Royal StatisticalSociety.2.2.21 The BCS Panel considered the possibility of unauthorised copyingof data, or its corruption, either accidentally or deliberately, atthe following points:(a) during the coding of the data schedules;(6) by the person responsible for data preparation;(c) in the course of recording on the raw data tape;(d) during transmission between the two establishments.2.2.22 Protection against falsification and entry of corrupt data on themain tapes, can be implemented within the ambit of the computersystem:(a) by the use of data vetting routines within the computer system;(b) by the control and management of the data before it entersthe computer system.2.2.23 Though complete accuracy cannot be tested for, to ensure thatas far as possible the census data is reasonable, all data whetheroriginating in Scotland or England is subjected to extensivecomputer data validation checks.2.2.24 Each data stream, that is the 1 per cent sample, the 10 per centsample, the complete schedules and the enumerators&apos; mark senseforms, are separately coded and punched, then edited and checkedby the computer program. In the case of the 10 per cent samples,the check is made against the full census as an additional validationmeasure.2.2.25 Nevertheless, data validation checks cannot provide protection against errors which are within the limits of the validation check,and unauthorised copying. It is necessary to provide controls over all aspects of handling schedules and data preparation.7
2.2.26 Although controls of this kind were in existence in the Englishsection, certain deficiencies were noted. recommendations regarding these have been made to the Registrar General.2.2.27 Where the original data is held in Scotland, the correction procedureinvolves the use of off-line data transmission over a leased PostOffice telephone line, though when that line breaks down, theswitched telephone network is used. Only authorised personnel are allowed to use the data transmission system. This applied,by order, at both ends of the link.2.2.28 The information passing on the transmission line is in code.Messages originating from the English section contain the fulldata for the record being queried but only data relating to incorrectschedules is passed through the network. Unauthorised line-tapping would be expensive, and the Panel did not consider this to be an area of high risk. However, it was considered thatsome procedural standards could be improved and this was recommended.Security within the computer environment .2.29 Operations subsequent to data preparation occur in the mainwithin the computer environment, and a common security system can be applied to the following possibilities:(a) deliberate or accidental corruption of data after entry on theMain Data Tape;(b) identification of individuals from the Census Office computerfiles;(c) removal of computer census records or printouts;id) unauthorised retrieval of census data in any form.2.2.30 Basic protection against these eventualities can be secured by applying the following measures:(a) control of physical access to the tape and disc library;(b) prevention of identifying information (e.g. names andaddresses) from being entered in the computer files;(c) control of the use of the computer and independent crosschecking of these controls;(d) control of physical access to computer print-outs;(c) establishment of procedures for dealing with waste;(/) separate storage of various generations of magnetic tapes;(g) maintenance of records of computer and magnetic tape anddisc usage. These should be regularly inspected by an officer who is independent of work scheduling and operationsresponsibilities and who reports directly to senior manage-ment;(/;) design of the supervisory program in use on the computer inorder to ensure(i) provision of inherent security features so as to control the identification accessing and handling of sensitive filesand to guard against unauthorised access of files,8
(ii) maintenance of a log of the use of the computer and ofmagnetic tape or disc files so as to enable adequatecross checking to be carried out,(iii) adequate protection against deliberate or accidentalcorruption of one program by another,(iv) adequate protection against corruption by unauthorisedpersonnel;(i)   management awareness of the need to integrate security requirements with functional procedures.Conditions for security2.2.31 Paragraph 2.2.30 defines the environment in which a computerhandling sensitive or classified information should be placed.2.2.32 It is of primary importance that there should be a clearly definedmanagement structure showing the boundaries between thecomponent parts of the organisation.2.2.33 For example, data control (or job assembly) should be quiteseparate and distinct and seen to be separate and distinct fromthe operation zone.2.2.34 Similarly, within the operation zone the magnetic tape and disclibrary should be clearly identifiable as a unit and it should bepossible to see the line of demarcation between the operationalzone and the duties of the magnetic tape and disc librarian.2.2.35 It should also be clear that all processes associated with the datainput and output streams, the work run on a computer and theissue of magnetic tapes and discs are monitored by an officer ina senior management position independent of the actual processes.Computer environment security in the English and Scottish sections2.2.36 In general terms the computer organisation in the English sectiondid not meet all of the above criteria. Detailed observations andrecommendations have been made to the Registrar General. Inparticular it should be noted that if it is a constraint upon theOPCS to use a general purpose operating system, then the require-ment for management appreciation of the resultant securityproblems becomes of paramount importance.2.2.37 The operations within the control of the Scottish section were regarded by the Panel as entirely satisfactory.2.3 Conclusions and recommendations.3.1 It has been brought to the attention of the Panel that subsequent to their initial visits some remedial measures have been taken.Nonetheless the Panel felt that the report should be based on thesituation that existed at the time of their visits.2.3.2 The Panel noted a considerable difference in the management andcontrol of operational procedures as they affected the security ofthe census operations between England and Scotland. Thesearose in part out of the different tasks of the two operations.9
2.3.3 The operation of the Scottish section afforded in all significantrespects protection against the risks defined in 2.2, paragraph2.2.9 (a)-(d) inclusive. The organisation in the English section,however, did not provide against the risks so fully, and as indicateddetailed observations and recommendations have been made tothe Registrar General.2.3.4 If it is considered that the level of sensitivity of census information is comparable with that of other information protected withinSOCS, then the standards achieved and maintained in the Scottishsection should be matched by those in the English section.2.3.5 External constraints, such as financial expediency, should beregarded as secondary considerations. We recommend that the operational procedures be thoroughly reviewed in the light ofour comments and that an evaluation is made to determine thebest method of operation (including the operating system).2.3.6 The frequent checking of security measures both for implementationand efficiency is considered of great importance. The Panelrecommends that there should be agreement to the setting up of regular independent monitoring of all relevant aspects of the census operation at all census processing centres. Similarly, itrecommends the independent examination of such aspects at anearly stage of the planning and design of the next and all futurecensuses.  The Society would be happy to assist in such a task.2.3.7 If these recommendations are implemented the Panel feels thatthe interests of the public and of the individual, will have been adequately protected.3. REPORT ON THE SECURITY OF INFORMATION IN THE 1971CENSUS PREPARED BY NOMINEES OF THE ROYAL STATISTICALSOCIETY3.1 Introduction3.1.1 In April 1971, considerable public disquiet was voiced concerningthe possibility of leakages of personal information compulsorilysupplied by the whole population in the 1971 Census. Thisdisquiet arose particularly because it became generally known thatextensive use would be made of computers in the handling,processing and storing of census information. On 14 April, 1971,Mr. Jeremy Thorpe, m p, made a widely reported speech in whichhe suggested that, to reassure the public, the Government should invite an independent body, such as the British Computer Society,to examine the general security procedures that were being followed.3.1.2 On 16 April, 1971, the then President of the British ComputerSociety met the Deputy Director of the Office of population censuses and Surveys and indicated that the Society was preparedto undertake an appraisal of the security of the computer systemsto be used for the 1971 Census.10
3.1.3 On 19 April, 1971, Mr. William Whitelaw, Leader of the Houseof Commons, stated in the House that &quot; the Census Office willgladly accept the offer made by the British Computer Society todiscuss with it the arrangements for the security and the same will apply to any other body &quot;.3.1.4 Subsequently, the Royal Statistical Society was invited by the registrar General&apos;s Office to participate in the discussions. TheSociety accepted the invitation to participate on the understandingthat their nominees would be perfectly free to make any criticismsor comments that they felt were called for. Furthermore it wasagreed that, whether or not the Secretaries of State (for social services and for Scotland) decided to publish the final report of the investigations when it was submitted to them, the Society&apos;snominees would be free to publish it or any part of it themselves,provided that none of the published material offended against theOfficial Secrets Act.3.1.5 At a joint meeting on 4 May, 1971, between representatives of theOffice of Population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS), the GeneralRegister Office (GRO) for Scotland, the British Computer society and the Royal Statistical Society, it was agreed that the BritishComputer Society would confine itself to an appraisal of thoseaspects of security relating to the computer systems used. TheRoyal Statistical Society would consider all other aspects of security of the relevant information, with particular reference tothe methods of its collection and to the information that would bemade available after processing, either by publication or to official and private organisations. It was agreed that special attention should be given to indirect disclosure of information, through thepossible manipulations of statistics that were compiled and published for very small sectors of the population.3.1.6 The Council of the Royal Statistical Society nominated as its representatives, Professor G. A. Barnard, Professor P. G. Mooreand Dr. J. A. Nelder. We now present our report and recom-mendations, and wish to record our appreciation of the co-operation and facilities made available to us by the Office of population censuses and Surveys and the General Register Office for Scotland.We believe that no part of this report need be covered by theOfficial Secrets Act, and therefore recommend that it should bepublished in full. We should emphasise that this report is personalto the three of us, and in no way binds the Royal Statistical Societyas a whole. Our recommendations are marked by a vertical line in the margin at the appropriate places and are numbered for easeof reference.3.1.7 In compiling this report we have become very well aware that nosystem for the security of information is absolute, and that the census is no exception to this general rule. It is basically operated by individuals handling information, some of a delicate nature,collected from individuals.  We recognise, too, that there has been11
considerable public unease about the last census which, unless itcan be shown to be groundless, could have repercussions on futurecensuses. It is not our present task to judge the utility of theinformation collected in a census in relation to the costs involved,but it is clear to us that, with an ever more complex society moreand more of whose activities fall in the sector that is controlledor influenced by Government, the need for statistical information on which to make rational decisions becomes ever more pressing.The balance between social need and individual privacy is a fineone which democratically elected Governments must themselvesmake on behalf of the electorate. We, in this report, are concerned that any assurances concerning confidentiality given by Govern-ments to obtain the information they seek are fully understood bythe public and are subsequently honoured.3.2 Collection of census information.2.1 The basic framework for censuses uses individual households asthe census unit. The information is obtained via a census form,for whose completion the head of household is responsible. Theform is delivered to households by enumerators, who subsequentlycall to collect the form after the census date, making a rough checkthat the form has been correctly completed.3.2.2 In assessing security precautions it is necessary to appreciate the magnitude of the operation and the numbers of staff involved incarrying out a census. The staff consist mainly of field workersspecially recruited on a temporary basis for the purpose. their numbers, in 1971, were as follows:Grade Number Length of EmploymentEngland   Scotlandand WalesSupervisors       ...        100 (not used)Census Officers ... 2,000 400AssistantCensus Officers 6,100 1,400Enumerators     ... 96,700 14,400Total   ...   104,000      16,200Supervisors are recruited by OPCS and they in turn recruit CensusOfficers, who in turn recruit Enumerators. All staff are requiredto sign undertakings under the 1920 Census Act and the 1970Census Regulations, which included reference to the confidentialityof the information to be handled. One prosecution of staffoccurred in 1971 for revealing information.1210 months (virtuallyfull time)6 months (part-time)3 months (part-time)5 weeks (part-time)
3.2.3    The civil servants who are concerned with census information arelocated in five main establishments, namely:OPCS Somerset House............ 20OPCS Titchfield............... 750GRO (Scotland) New Register House...... 5GRO (Scotland) Census Office......... 612Scottish Office Computer Service (SOCS)     ... 40Total Employees       .........     1,427These employees are all recruited through normal Civil Serviceprocedures and all sign, as normal Civil Service practice, theOfficial Secrets Act, and are hence required to treat all informationacquired as confidential. There are no instances in recent yearsof prosecutions of such staff for non-authorised disclosure ofinformation.3.2.4 Enumerators, being human, can be interested in personal detailsof individuals who are known to them. Hence the local arrange-ment for delivery and collection of census forms should be organised in such a way that the enumerators operate in areas that are reasonably removed from both their home and their place of work.This is recognised by OPCS but it is clear to us that, under existing arrangements, cases have arisen where enumerators were knownto the individuals concerned, whilst other cases have arisen wherethe enumerator could make use of the information he has gatheredin the course of his normal duties. We accordingly recommendthat enumerators should, unless specifically authorised by a census Officer, operate at least five miles away from either their home address or their place of work and, more generally, as faraway as local transport circumstances reasonably permit. Inparticular, local government officers should not operate withinthe area of their own authority (ie district officers should not operate within their own districts, county officers not in theirown county). This recommendation is likely to cause some difficulty in scattered and outlying areas, particularly in Scotlandwhere it is customary to use Registrars as Census Officers.Nevertheless, we believe it to be a necessary step both to preserveconfidentiality and to be seen to do so; the problems of outlyingareas could be handled through more extensive use of postal formsas mentioned below.3.2.5 The right to return a census form under sealed cover already exists, but the wording on the census form, and the instructionsto enumerators themselves, limit this right to individual membersof a household other than the householder. The generally heldview is that the right is only exercised when the individual hassomething to hide from his or her acquaintances and the enumeratoris normally expected to collect the sealed cover forms. Anyforms so collected are checked by the enumerator.   If the forms13
are returned by post to the local Census officer (eg when the householder expects to be temporarily away on census night) theyare checked by the Census Officer. Hence confidentiality is notin fact preserved in the manner commonly assumed. Confi-dentiality is preserved when, as happens in a number of instances,the form is returned direct to Titchfield, but this possibility isnot specifically allowed for, either in the wording on the censusform or in the instructions to enumerators. We recommend thatall households should be given the right to return the form by post, but this should be done in such a way that it is seen to bea means of saving the time of both enumerators and householdersand giving an enhanced degree of confidentiality. We accordingly recommend that any such forms returned by post should be to&apos;an office outside the local authority concerned and follow upenquiries should normally proceed by post.The wording on the census form includes the following undertaking:&quot; The information you give on the form will be treated asconfidential and used only for compiling statistics. no information about named individuals will be passed by the census Office to any other Government Department or anyother authority or person.&quot;This wording appears, however, to be capable of misunderstanding.For example, in 1971, the census data was used to provide asampling frame from which the Social Survey Division of OPCSdrew a sample of nurses and ex-nurses and approached themindividually for their participation in a voluntary survey. Thisuse was, in our opinion, only doubtfully covered by the wordingquoted above from the census form and by other public pro-nouncements on the confidentiality of information given in the census operation. The situation is further clouded by the factthat in 1970 the Government Social Survey was combined withthe Registrar Generafs Department to form the Office of population Censuses and Surveys (OPCS). Hence they are nowone Department and the census wording quoted above refers toother Government Departments. We recommend that, before any further such uses are made of census information, the position should be clarified so that an open decision can be taken on whether or not such uses are permitted. We refer to this problemagain in the next section.The Census Order was laid before Parliament on 28 January, 1970,and was debated on 17 February, 1970, in the House of commons and 24 February, 1970, in the House of Lords. There was considerable concurrent newspaper publicity organised by the census Office. The debates were short and perfunctory inthe House of Commons it was held late at night and only three members spoke outside the two junior ministers involved. the debates were clearly inhibited to some extent because the specimencensus forms were not available with the Census Order. Thespecimen forms were tabled in mid 1970, but raised no comments14
or queries from Members and no further debate appears to have occurred. It was only in the month preceding the census that members and the general public began to express doubts and fearsand public unease on the security of information manifested itself.Hence good public relations at this stage was of paramount importance and was to some extent lacking in the 1971 Census.We recommend a much greater degree of emphasis being placedon the continuous development of public relations, both insideParliament and in the country at large. As one means to thisend, we recommend that in future a White Paper be published,prior to the Census Order debates in Parliament, which wouldlay out, inter alia, the proposed census form, the changes thatare being made from the last census, with reasons, and theadditional follow up surveys that are proposed using the censusdata. Such a White Paper could subsequently form the basis ofa popular &quot; Post Office &quot; guide to the census for more generalcirculation. We would draw attention in this context to thecommendable initiatives of the Central Statistical Office in publishing population and other statistics in more popular forms.We question whether it is necessary that all the information askedfor on a census form need be on a complete census basis, withall the panoply of legal compulsion. It is clear that there isalready a certain amount of customer resistance to the form, andthe more lengthy and complex the form becomes, the higher thisis likely to be. We recommend that further consideration begiven either to the use of a variable master census form whichdoes not ask the same set of questions of every householder or,alternatively, to the use of the census as a sampling frame fromwhich further voluntary follow up studies to cover points both within and outside the current census could be made. For thelatter, it would be necessary to make it quite clear to all concerned that the studies were of a voluntary rather than a compulsorynature.3.3 Publication and use of census information.3.1 We have examined the uses to which census information is put,and the form in which the information is made available both tothe public and to Government departments, via published tabula-tions and specifically requested tabulations paid for separately.We have a number of comments and recommendations which aregiven below.3.3.2 There is clearly some difference of opinion between the absolutistview of confidentiality (which believes that no census resultsbeyond bare totals should be disclosed) and the pragmatic view,which believes that statistical information can be made available,provided that the possibilities of disclosure of information aboutidentifiable individuals are reduced to an acceptably low level.Most people would accept that the absolutist view is too extreme,in that publishing any information at all apart from population153.2.8
totals creates some degree of disclosure. In trying to strike asensible balance on this issue, it should be borne in mind that whilst a particular census form may include some sensitiveinformation regarding individuals which it would be exceedingly difficult for an enquirer to obtain from other sources, it is also truethat much of the information on the census form could be obtained through other channels if the person seeking it were sufficientlypersistent.3.3.3 Although a balance must be struck between what can and cannotbe disclosed, we cannot find any official statement on the principlesguiding the drawing of this line. Wherever the line is drawn, it isclear that OPCS believes that it can disclose census information to other sections within the office. We have already commentedon the way in which the 1971 Census information was used bythe Social Survey Division of OPCS for a survey of nurses. Anysuch information, whilst collected on a voluntary basis, can thenbe handed in a statistical form to other departments. Whilst itmay be true that this use of census data is economical (eg a cheapmethod of providing a sampling frame) it is also clear that most people are not fully aware that such uses are apparently coveredby the Census Act (although not thought of at the time the 1920Census Act was passed), or that the follow-up, unlike the censusitself, is on a voluntary basis.3.3.4 It has been suggested to us that it would be possible to use censusdata to pick out minority groups, say the disabled, in order togive them information about specific help of a financial or other form that might be available to them. If census data are not used for this purpose, alternative channels must be used whichare expensive and it is extremely unlikely that they are as efficient.Yet it is doubtful if there would be universal acceptance of thenotion that such a use was desirable and legitimate and we do not,therefore, recommend that the use of census data should beextended in this manner.3.3.5 Attention tends to be concentrated upon the possibility of individuals obtaining information about other individuals. Thereis, of course, the more serious problem of an unscrupulous agency,whether Governmental or commercial, gaining access to and using the total census data for purposes that are contrary to the wishesand understanding of the population as a whole. It does notappear to be feasible to avoid altogether the possibility of sucha happening and the advent of magnetic tape has perhaps increasedthis possibility, through the enhanced portability of census records.The Registrars General are given specific duties under the CensusAct of 1920, but are required to act under the appropriateSecretaries of State. We have been glad to note, not only thatthey are aware of their responsibilities with regard to theconfidentiality of the information entrusted to their care, but alsothat they have generally secured the confidence of the public inthis respect.  The Official Secrets Act and the Census Act of 192016
binds all the employees and the respective Census Offices, whilst the enumerators sign a special declaration which may, however,not be very effective at the later stages of their work because theyarc only temporary employees and leaks may only be detectedafter they have left their employment. However, while leaks aboutindividuals can occur at the enumerator stage, major leaks would only occur at some later stage and, whilst full records remain,there is no way to guarantee indefinite safeguarding of theinformation.3.3.6 Apart from the regular tabulations made and published by the census Office, there are many requests for ad hoc tabulations.The Census Office assure us that all requests for such ad hoctabulations are scrutinised using the same strict criteria ofconfidentiality as apply for published tabulations, bearing in mind as well the possibility that separate pieces of information so obtained could be put together by the recipients.   We recommendVI j that this safeguard should be made more explicit and guidelinesdrawn up and published as to what can and cannot be provided.(See paragraph 3.3.9 below.)3.3.7 At present it is not possible for a member of the general public toestablish the details of any non-published tabulations that havebeen passed from the Census Office to other Governmentdepartments or to outside bodies or individuals. Since the basicdata are provided by the general public, we believe that this information should be available to help to allay some of theworries that exist. We accordingly recommend that the RegistrarsGeneral should maintain for public inspection a list of all ad hoctabulations that have been issued, together with a specimen copyVII I of the tabulations and the names and addresses of the requestingorganisations. This would include any tabulations passed to other government departments.3.3.8 Published tabulations which involve small numbers in any of theindividual cells in the tables are commonly rounded, eg all numbersmay be given to the nearest five. This is done to assist in themaintenance of confidentiality where small numbers could lead tothe identification of individuals. Such a need applies particularly to tabulations relating to small localised areas. The currentproposal to round to the nearest five may not be the best possible,and we are pleased to note that the Census Office is aware of this problem and is consulting a number of statisticians to establish the best possible way of handling this difficulty, bearing in mind the need both to provide relevant information as well as to protect the individual.3.3.9 We have shown in preceding paragraphs that there is considerablepublic unease about the uses to which census data can be put andthe precise form in which information can be delivered. Webelieve that it is essential to allay public disquiet by having somestanding review body, seen to be independent of the census17
operation itself, advising on these problems. We accordingly recommend that such a standing review body be set up. its functions would be:(a) to define in a suitably explicit manner the principles whichshould apply to ad hoc tabulations and the use of census datato provide sampling frames for other surveys;(b) to consider any complaints that may be received fromindividuals or organisations concerning the conduct ofcensuses or the improper use of census information;(c) to report on these matters from time to time to Parliament.We have noted that there was recently a Private Members Billput before Parliament by Mr. L. Huckfield and others concerningthe Control of Personal Information, although it has now lapsed.The proposed Bill aimed to establish a data bank Tribunal andInspectorate and to provide for the licencing of data bankscontaining personal information stored in such data banks. It isnot clear from a reading of the Bill whether data held by theGovernment would have been included. Furthermore, we have some doubts as to the practicability of the proposals that weremade and we are disturbed to find that, whereas the proposedTribunal must have at least five lawyers, there is no legalrequirement for a professional statistician. Although this parti-cular Bill has been dropped we believe, nevertheless, that such a development is inevitable and necessary in the present climateand that our proposals as regards the information contained inthe census should be viewed in the light of these and other possible developments.3.3.10 The degree of complexity of census information asked for indifferent countries of the world appears to vary considerablyaccording to the degree of development of the country. Ascountries become more developed, the need and desire to havefuller and more detailed information about the demographic and social make-up of the population rises. Indeed, we need onlylook at some of the questions asked by Members of parliament or Ministers in recent years to realise the implied requirement of having available up to date and accurate data about ourpopulation in order to pursue coherent and economic socialpolicies. We recommend that OPCS should continue to extend its systematic studies of the coverage, security and use of censusinformation in other developed countries, such as Canada,Norway, USA, etc, all of whom collect fairly detailed and complexcensus information, sometimes of much greater complexity than our own. We believe that the results of such studies should beused to assist in the definition and administration of the principlesoutlined in the previous paragraphs. At the same time, werecommend that OPCS should look more closely at the use ofsample surveys in its work, bearing in mind the great deal ofcensus information wanted for the deduction of trends ratherthan absolute numbers. Furthermore, we recommend thatOPCS should consider delegating some of the census activity to18X
regional or county level where the information is often most needed, since by that means it could probably obtain a higherdegree of co-operation and acceptance from the public than whenthe information is collected on a central basis. Any collection ofinformation should, however, still be subject to the caveats outlined in paragraph 3.2.3 above.Finally, we come to the question of storage of census records.We understand that in Scotland these are held in the custody ofthe Registrar General, and in England and Wales in the PublicRecord Office. The information currently remains inaccessibleexcept to the Census Office for 100 years after the census is held.As long as the records are maintained, there cannot, of course,be any complete guarantee that nobody can get hold of them, egan occupying power in time of war. Official statisticians have reason to be proud of their record in this regard. In Norway inthe 1939-45 war, for example, not only the official statisticalrecords but also the records of the resistance movement itselfwere safeguarded by their Central Statistical Office. After thelapse of 100 years census records have proved of very great value in the study of social history. We therefore recommend that inthis respect the present procedures should be retained but that,in view of their delicacy, sole responsibility for security of themost recent census records should rest with the Registrars General.(signed)G. A. BarnardP. G. MooreJ. A. NelderRoyal Statistical SocietySeptember 19724. GOVERNMENT COMMENTS ON THE DETAILED RECOM-MENDATIONS MADE BY THE NOMINEES OF THE ROYALSTATISTICAL SOCIETY IN THEIR report.1 I &quot; We accordingly recommend that enumerators should, unlessspecifically authorised by a Census Office, operate at least fivemiles away from either their home address or their place of workand, more generally, as far away as local transport circumstancesreasonably permit. In particular, local government officers shouldnot operate within the area of their own authority (ie districtofficers should not operate within their own districts, countyofficers not in their own county).&quot;Recommendation I refers to two distinct situations arising from the localarrangements for enumeration: first, where an enumerator was knownto a householder; and second, where an enumerator could use for other purposes information gathered in the census or whilst taking the census.193.3.11xi
4.2 In 1971 census officers were instructed to assign enumerators to areasaway from their homes. A few census officers however erred on the sideof convenience for the enumerator. This apart, it would never bepossible to ensure that no individual enumerator would know or be known by any single householder, particularly in remote areas. In fact,the number of householders who complained to the Census Offices thatthey knew, or were known by, their enumeratorj(was less than 0-002 percent of the total. Moreover any householder san choose to make a return in a sealed envelope through the enumerator or through the post so thatit was not seen by the enumerator at all (see paragraphs 4.8 to 4.12below). These arrangements will continoarand increased emphasis willbe laid on them.4.3 The Government fully appreciate the feelings of those people who maynot wish to hand over information to enumerators known to them andthey believe that the arrangements just mentioned provide a fully adequate option. They are clear however that the wider geographicaldeployment of the field staff that is recommended would not in itselfsolve the problem but would instead result in a serious loss of efficiency and substantial extra cost.4.4 The main disadvantage of a &quot; five mile rule &quot; is that it would make itmuch more difficult to recruit sufficient enumerators of the requiredcalibre. For many towns surrounded by thinly populated rural areasthere would not be a sufficiently large pool of potential enumeratorswithin reach. Even in more continuously built-up areas enumeratorswould, under a five mile rule, frequently have to work in unfamiliarphysical and social surroundings thus increasing risks of poor rapportand under-coverage. Furthermore the prospect of repeated travellingmight so hinder recruitment of suitable part-time staff, like housewives,that the quality of enumeration would suffer. Finally it is estimatedthat increased travelling costs with a &quot; five mile rule &quot; would add  1-5 million, or about 10 per cent, to the cost of a full census.4.5 As it is, all field staff have to sign an undertaking to perform their duties in accordance with the Census Act 1920 which prohibits the unauthorisedcommunication of information acquired in the course of taking the census under penalty of imprisonment or fine or both. Every allegedbreach of the undertaking is followed up and indeed one member of thefield staff was prosecuted in 1971.4.6 To adopt the proposed rule about areas in which local governmentofficers could operate would seriously cut down the number who would come forward to help with the census, particularly in the new and largerlocal authority areas. In 1971, 44 per cent of census officers and 29 percent of enumerators were local government officers. Local governmentofficers are well fitted for census work and they know from experiencethe importance of maintaining confidentiality in dealing with the public.Anything that would reduce the numbers that would work in the censuswould be a severe handicap. Another source of field staff is the locallybased registration service which provided 28 per cent of census officersin 1971. This service too has the public&apos;s confidence and the government intend that in future censuses registration officers should continue to beable to act as census officers from their registration offices.20
4.7 The Government therefore are unable to implement the distance andexclusion rules recommended for the held staff in future censuses. Extracare will, however, be taken to reduce the chance of overlap between an enumerators personal or business contacts and his enumeration area.In any case it will always be open to a householder to return his formunseen by his enumerator (see paragraph 4.14 below).4.8 II &quot; We recommend that all households should be given the right toreturn the form by post, but this should be done in such a way thatit is seen to be a means of saving time of both enumerators andhouseholders and giving an enhanced degree of confidentiality.We accordingly recommend that any such form returned by postshould be to an Office outside the local authority concerned andfollow up enquiries should normally proceed by post.&quot;Before dealing with the substance of these recommendations it seemsnecessary to consider whether some of the statements on which they are based are themselves well-founded. Thus the conclusion (paragraph 3.2.5)that &quot; confidentiality is not in fact preserved in the manner commonlyassumed &quot; is not accepted. In 1971 there were three procedures for thereturn of completed forms under cover and in each case the householderor individual was told clearly how the form would subsequently be handled: first, Personal (&quot; P &quot;) forms were available within a householdand were sealed in envelopes marked &quot; the census enumerator &quot;; second,forms could be posted to the local census officer in envelopes handed tothe householder and addressed to the census officer by the enumerator;and third, forms could be posted to the headquarters of OPCS orGRO (Scotland) in a pre-addressed envelope issued by the enumerator.The third way had not been intended originally for use by householdersthat were present on census night, but this use developed spontaneouslyby adapting what was originally intended only for those unable, usuallybecause of absence, to hand back their form to the enumerator.4.9 The forms returned in envelopes marked &quot; the census enumerator &quot; werechecked by the enumerator. The forms returned by post to the censusofficer were dealt with by the census officer or his assistant and were not shown to the enumerator. None of the forms returned direct toheadquarters with personal details was seen by field staff. In cases where an incomplete return was received at headquarters the form itself, or ablank form with an indication of the sections remaining to be completed,was posted back direct to the householder.4.10 Furthermore the statement in paragraph 3.2.5 that the right to return a form under sealed cover was limited to individual members of a householdother than the householder himself is misleading. Whilst in 1971 any individual who was not head of the household could protect his personaldetails from other members of the household by making his return undersealed cover, the householder could secure similar protection of his personal details by not showing the completed census form to any other member of his household.4.11 Nowhere was the impression left that the census organisation regarded the personal or postal return as a device for those with something to hide.Enumerators were instructed to issue personal returns both where21
members of the household were reluctant to give information to the householder and also where the householder was reluctant to collect it from them.4.12 The widespread concern about revealing personal information to localcensus officials in 1971 has led the Census Offices to consider carefullywhether they can extend the scope for making returns that will not be seen by local field staff. In the voluntary test census held in October 1972,householders had the option of (1) handing their forms back to theenumerator for checking, or (2) asking for an envelope in which to seal the form so that either (a) the enumerator would not see it or (b) it wouldnot be seen by either the enumerator or the census officer, or (3) asking for a franked envelope for a postal return to the test census headquarters.The small scale of this test made it possible for the staff from testheadquarters to telephone or revisit any householder who had sent in anincomplete form. The results of the test showed that the new proceduresatisfied the householders who did not wish their forms to be seen bylocal field staff, but there was extra work in dealing with incomplete orunsatisfactory forms returned in envelopes and in accounting for formsrecorded by the enumerator as &quot; for return by post &quot;.4.13 The recommendation itself would amount to an extended use of the postduring enumeration and the Report wholly ignores not only the disadvantages of postal returns and postal follow-up but also the positiveadvantages of collection by enumerators. The collection visit is extremelyvaluable for enumerators to help the householder to fill in the form and topoint out any omissions which can then be rectified on the spot. The opinionsurvey after the 1971 Census found that 82 per cent of adults thought ithelpful to have the enumerator call. The disadvantages of postal returnare: first, simply to check the receipt and completeness of the returns,before any follow-up, would add considerably to the organisation required at the peak of the census; second, unless there are far fewer unintentionalomissions by householders than hitherto, one of two things would haveto be done: either the Census Offices would have to return a largeproportion of posted forms for correction or completion which would add substantially to the work-load and, hence, the cost, or much of themissing information would have to be imputed which would appreciablyreduce the accuracy of the census; third, if the post was used to returnincomplete forms, there would be some risk of disclosure of informationbecause the returned form might be opened inadvertently by someoneat the address other than the person to whom it was directed; fourth,a householder might covertly refuse to complete his census form byalleging that it had gone astray in the post and this would greatly handicapthe Census Offices in carrying out their duty to ensure that every headof household had completed a census form. In countries where postalreturn is extensively used the householders legal obligation is notdischarged until the Census Office has received a satisfactorily completedreturn.4.14 In summary, the Government accept that a facility should be provided to permit householders to return their forms unseen by their ownenumerator and intend that the most effective method of doing thisshould be employed in future censuses.22
4.15 III &quot; We recommend that, before any further such uses are made ofcensus information, the position should be clarified so that an open decision can be taken on whether or not such uses are permitted.&quot;This recommendation refers to uses of the census as a sampling frame for voluntary follow-up surveys. The existing principle is that OPCS andthe General Register Office, Scotland may themselves carry out voluntarysample surveys after a census, and, for this purpose, they may select fromthe census records a sample of individuals or households to be approached.The intention to have follow-up voluntary surveys using samples drawn from the 1971 Census was referred to in the House of Commons debate on the 1971 Census Order in the context of the planned follow-upvoluntary survey on incomes: and the launching of that survey was subsequently announced in the House of Commons in March 1972. TheGovernment have no reason to believe that the status of the Social SurveyDivision within OPCS was misunderstood by the public during the follow-up voluntary surveys nor is there any evidence that the assurances of confidentiality given in the 1971 Census were not absolutely maintained.However they accept that the census form and associated publicity in1971 did not make the public sufficiently aware of the possibility of voluntary follow-up surveys (by post or by interview) and steps will betaken to rectify this in future censuses.4.16 IV &quot; We recommend a much greater degree of emphasis being placedon continuous development of public relations, both insideParliament and in the country at large. As one means to thisend, we recommend that in future a White Paper be published,prior to the Census Order debates in Parliament, which wouldlay out, inter alia, the proposed census form, the changes thatare being made since the last census, with reasons, and the additionalfollow-up Surveys that are proposed using the census data.&quot;The emphasis given in the Report to good public relations is welcomed,and the Government will take appropriate steps. It is not consideredthat the proposal for a White Paper to focus the public discussion on aforthcoming census would be apt. This is because of the existingParliamentary procedure leading up to a census, which already has two stages: first an Order in Council, which plays the part recommended for the suggested White Paper in that the essence of each proposedquestion is specified; and, second, the detailed Regulations. Thesetwo stages must be started some fifteen months before census day. a white Paper preceding the Order would have to be published at leasteighteen months before census day, and would then partly overlap thefunctions of the existing two stages. The addition of a White Paper tothe parliamentary procedure for a census should therefore only be madeas part of a much wider reform which would probably require legislation.4.17 Publicity for the next census will be considered nearer the time. Butthe public&apos;s views on the design of future censuses is already being sought:thus the householders taking part in the 1972 test (see paragraph 4.12)were invited to comment on the test and on census-taking generally.23
4.18 V   &quot; We recommend that further consideration be given either to theuse of a variable master census form which does not ask the sameset of questions of every household, or alternatively, to the use ofthe census as a sampling frame from which further voluntaryfollow-up studies to cover points both within and outside thecurrent census could be made.&quot;Both parts of this recommendation conform with existing policy and are accepted.  A way of using variable census forms was worked out earlyin 1972 and tested in October; the analysis of the results will show whether such methods avoid sample bias.  The 1971 Census returns have been used as a sampling frame for voluntary follow-up surveys on three topics:income, nursing qualifications and qualified manpower.  This methodwill be developed as a way of measuring population characteristics(subject to what has been said in paragraph 4.15 above).  It should be emphasised that all potential respondents are clearly informed thatparticipation in follow-up surveys is voluntary (cf, paragraph 3.3.3).4.19 The statement (paragraph 3.3.5) that the field staffs signed undertakingsmay not be effective in the later stages of their work could be true if the penalties for disclosure were no more than the loss of employment orearnings. In fact, the penalty can be either a fine or imprisonment;moreover it can apply whether or not the person is still employed by the census Offices.4.20 VI   &quot; The Census Office assure us that all requests for such ad hoctabulations are scrutinised using the same strict criteria ofconfidentiality as apply for published tabulations, bearing in mind as well the possibility that separate pieces of information so obtainedcould be put together by the recipients.   We recommend that thissafeguard should be made more explicit and guidelines drawn up and published as to what can and cannot be provided.&quot;The guidelines for safeguarding the information are the same for allcensus tabulations: namely, that they must not, either directly or throughcomparison with other material, disclose any information about anidentifiable individual or household.  It is not evident that this broadand comprehensive safeguard, which was stated explicitly in the &quot; slip in &quot;page delivered with every 1971 census form, needs to be refined furtheras the recommendation proposes.  Because some of the detailed analysesthat are published include very small numbers, an additional safeguardof small random adjustments was introduced in 1971 and has virtuallyeliminated the possibility of &quot; indirect&quot; disclosure^  The Reportprovides no evidence that the release of tabulations does, or could inthe future, lead to disclosure.4.21 VII &quot; We accordingly recommend that the Registrars General should maintain for public inspection a list of all ad hoc tabulations that have been issued, together with a specimen copy of the tabulationsand the names and addresses of the requesting organisations.This would include any tabulations passed to other GovernmentDepartments.&quot;* The suggestion to introduce small random adjustments was made by Professor Barnard one of the Royal Statistical Society nominees to whom the Census Offices are grateful.24
The Census Offices already keep a record of all ad hoc tabulations issuedincluding the names and addresses of the recipients. Moreover detailsof ad hoc tabulations, whether issued or proposed, are always provided to anyone asking for related tabulations. This gives customers anopportunity to obtain copies of existing tabulations more cheaply andat the same time it reduces the risk of duplicate, or near duplicate,processing. The Census Offices have always been willing to supply the names of recipients of tabulations, but there has been very littledemand for this information. The Government accepts the recom-mendation that the Census Offices should maintain a list for public inspection containing descriptions of all ad hoc tables issued, withexamples where this is practicable, together with the names and addressesof the recipients.4.22 viii &quot; We accordingly recommend that such a standing review body beset up.  Its function would be:(a) to define in a suitably explicit manner the principles whichshould apply to ad hoc tabulations and the use of census datato provide sampling frames for other surveys;(b) to consider any complaints that may be received from individuals or organisations concerning the conduct of censuses or theimproper use of census information;(f) to report on these matters from time to time to Parliament.&quot;Function (a) would have two parts: to define the principles governing(i) ad hoc tabulations and (ii) the use of census data to provide samplingframes for other surveys. The principle governing (i) is set out explicitlyin paragraph 4.20 above and no elaboration is called for. However the census Offices always welcome any suggestions about the applicationof the principle. The principle governing (ii) the use of census datafor surveys is set out explicitly in paragraph 4.15 above. However theGovernment undertake that in future, whenever census data are to beused for a voluntary survey, this will be announced in Parliament. Thefact that these surveys are voluntary entitles anyone to refuse to take part.The Government do not therefore accept the need for a standing review body to carry out function (a).4.23 Functions (6) and (r) of the proposed body the consideration of com-plaints and the preparation of reports to Parliament are similar to those proposed by the Younger Committee on Privacy for the standing commission on computers that it recommended should be set up(Cmnd. 5012, paragraph 621) and which it suggested might also be givenoversight over Government computers (paragraph 628). The government. re is- studying the Committee&apos;jj conclusions and recommendations, and 4t-tWJkkw has also been conducting tts1 own review of the categories of personal information held or likely to be held in the computer systems of departments and of the rules governing its storage and use (Hansard,15 December, 1970 (col. 328)). The Government intend, to publish -its^6&quot;&quot;conclusions on computers and privacy in a White Paper and until then it would be premature to reach an independent conclusion on the above recommendation viii (b) and (c).25
The Census Offices already keep a record of all ad hoc tabulations issuedincluding the names and addresses of the recipients. Moreover detailsof ad hoc tabulations, whether issued or proposed, are always provided to anyone asking for related tabulations. This gives customers anopportunity to obtain copies of existing tabulations more cheaply andat the same time it reduces the risk of duplicate, or near duplicate,processing.

The principle governing (ii) the use of census datafor surveys is set out explicitly in paragraph 4.15 above. However theGovernment undertake that in future, whenever census data are to beused for a voluntary survey, this will be announced in Parliament. Thefact that these surveys are voluntary entitles anyone to refuse to take part.The Government do not therefore accept the need for a standing review body to carry out function (a).4.23 Functions (b) and (c) of the proposed body the consideration of corn-plaints and the preparation of reports to Parliament are similar to those proposed by the Younger Committee on Privacy for the standing commission on computers that it recommended should be set up[Cmnd. 5012, paragraph 621) and which it suggested might also be givenoversight over Government computers (paragraph 628). The Governmentare is- studying the Committee^ conclusions and recommendations, and 4t-tA.Sa^ has also been conducting rts^own review of the categories of personal information held or likely to be held in the computer systems of departments and of the rules governing its storage and use (Hansard,15 December, 1970 (col. 328)). The Government intend to publish its t&apos;4conclusions on computers and privacy in a White Paper and until then it would be premature to reach an independent conclusion on the above recommendation VIII (b) and (c).25
4.24 Certain features of the present position, however, are important andshould be recorded. Under the Census Act 1920, the Registrars general for England and Wales and for Scotland carry out their census functions under the direction of the Secretaries of State for Social Services and forScotland respectively. The two Secretaries of State therefore alreadyexercise the functions specified for the proposed review body; and theydeal with complaints either by correspondence with M Ps acting onconstituents&apos; behalf, or by Parliamentary Questions or occasionally in parliamentary debate. In addition, where an individual or organisationfeels that something has not been dealt with satisfactorily by the CensusOffice acting for the Minister, it may be referred through the m Pconcerned to the Parliamentary Commissioner (the Ombudsman).4.25 IX    &quot; We recommend that OPCS should continue to extend itssystematic studies of the coverage, security and use of censusinformation in other developed countries, such as Canada, Norway,USA, etc, all of whom collect fairly detailed and complex censusinformation, sometimes of much greater complexity than our own.&quot;The Government welcome, the Society&apos;s support for the Census Officesto intensify their studies of the practice and experience of other countries.Indeed the studies so far made suggest that the standards of confidentialityin the collection and publication of information in the censuses in britain are no less rigorous, and frequently more rigorous, than those of other nations.4.26 X &quot; At the same time, we recommend that OPCS should look more closely at the use of sample surveys in its work, bearing in mind thegreat deal of census information wanted for the deduction of trendsrather than absolute numbers. Furthermore, we recommend thatOPCS should consider delegating some of the census activity to regional or county level where the information is often most needed,since by that means it could probably obtain a higher degree ofco-operation and acceptance from the public than when theinformation is collected on a central basis.&quot;Recommendation X is in two parts. The Government accept the first part, which asks for further study of the role of sample surveys,particularly for measuring trends. Such a study is already being made,and made all the more easily because of the merger of the formerGovernment Social Survey Department with the General Register Officeto create the joint Department of OPCS.4.27 The second part of recommendation X that more of the census work should be delegated to regional or county authorities is not accepted. Thesuggestion that this extra delegation of work would increase publicco-operation appears to contradict paragraph 3.2.4 (particularly Recom-mendation I) which implies that the public is already uneasy about theappointment of local government officials as census officers andenumerators.4.28 There is in fact a very high degree of public co-operation in the census asat present conducted and the coverage and quality of the returns receivedfrom the public are both good. Public acceptance of the census is discussed in section 5 below, which shows that in an opinion survey26
conducted after Census Day 1971, 83 per cent of the 2,285 adultsinterviewed considered the census to be either absolutely essential orfairly essential. This is a high degree of acceptance and there is no evidence that delegation of census work to regional or county authorities would improve on this. The case for delegation (with the powers of compulsion that this necessarily implies) has not been established, andthe Government do not consider that any advantage would be gained by accepting the second part of recommendation X.4.29 XI &quot; We therefore recommend that in this respect the present procedures[on the storage of census returns] should be retained but that, inview of their delicacy, sole responsibility for security of the most recent census records should rest with the Registrars General.&quot;After the census forms are no longer required in the census offices those for England and Wales are removed to the Public Record Office forsecure storage, whereas those in Scotland are held by the GRO (Scotland).However, the Public Record Office storage conforms to the security requirements approved by the Registrar General for England and Wales,so that present practice already closely follows the recommendation.5.  PUBLIC ATTITUDE TOWARDS THE CENSUS5.1 The Reports by the nominees of the British Computer Society and of theRoyal Statistical Society take as a starting point the public attitudestowards various aspects of the census operation. Thus the Report ofthe British Computer Society opens with the comment &quot; In April 1971considerable public&apos;disquiet was voiced concerning the possibility ofleakages of personal information compulsorily supplied &quot;. The Reportof the Royal Statistical Society states &quot; there is considerable publicunease about the uses to which census data can be put &quot; (paragraph 3.3.9).Some perspective for these statements is given by two public opinionsurveys, one made during the week before census day and one sevenweeks after.5.2 In summary the surveys indicate that there was a high level of publicawareness of the census. The later survey showed that the traditionalmethod of &quot; doorstep &quot; enumeration was accepted as a helpful methodof collecting information by five-sixths of the survey respondents. How-ever the surveys showed that there was considerable misunderstandingboth about the purposes of the census and about the degree of con-fidentiality given to census returns: some 35 per cent of respondentsthought that a main purpose of a census was &quot; to provide a record of people&apos;s addresses for the government &quot; and 27 per cent that information from individual census forms was available to &quot; people working forgovernment&quot;.5.3 Set out in paragraphs 5.7 to 5.9 are the number of householders who for various reasons chose to return their census forms by post. Thosewho did so on grounds of privacy, ie in order to by-pass local officials,accounted for only 0-6 per cent of all the forms in the whole census.27
5.4 The first opinion survey* was commissioned and conducted independently of the Census Offices. The fieldwork was done between 19 and 25 April1971, the week before census day, and findings were based on a totalsample of 1,135 household heads in 120 constituencies throughout great Britain. The secondf was commissioned by the Census offices and carried out by an agency. The fieldwork was done between 5 and10 June 1971, the seventh week after census day, and findings were basedon a total sample of 2,285 adults (aged 16 and over) through out heUnited Kingdom.5.5 The first survey showed that, amongst heads of households in the weekbefore census day, 97 per cent knew about the census; 47 per cent believedthat &quot; the secrets of everyone&apos;s private lives are kept fully secure bythe census organisers &quot;, but 45 per cent thought that &quot; there is a risk that information could fall into the hands of the wrong people &quot;. Ofthe 77 per cent who had already been seen by their census enumerator,81 per cent thought the enumerator had been polite and helpful and 1 percent thought the reverse.5.6 In the more extensive survey made after census day, 69 per cent of adultsremembered receiving the illustrated leaflet with the census form and, ofthose, 54 per cent said that they had read all of it, 25 per cent part of itand 21 per cent none of it. 82 per cent of adults thought it helpful to have the enumerator call and, of these, 55 per cent were aware thattheir form could have been posted back. In answer to a question on whether the census was essential, 38 per cent of respondents regarded it as &quot; absolutely essential45 per cent as &quot; fairly essential&quot; and15 per cent as &quot; not essential with 2 per cent replying &quot; don&apos;t know &quot;.They were asked to choose from a list the main purposes which they thought the census served: 80 per cent chose &quot; for forecasting population growth &quot;; 65 per cent &quot; to help local government planning &quot;; 53 per cent&quot;to provide information on population for industry&quot;; 50 per cent&quot;to provide information for planning public transport and roads&quot;;but 35 per cent thought a main purpose of the census was &quot; to providea record of people&apos;s addresses for the government&quot;. They were also asked to state who, in their view, were allowed to see information from individual census forms: four possible answers were listed. 65 per centreplied &quot; people in the Census Office only &quot;; 27 per cent replied &quot;peopleworking for government&quot;; 3 per cent replied &quot;qualified people in industry&apos;&apos;, and 7 per cent replied &quot; anyone &quot;. Asked whether there were any questions which they felt strongly should not have been includedin the census, 13 per cent gave a positive reply and, of these, 35 per cent(or 4b per cent of a)l respondents) mentioned the question on place of birth of parents, 34 per cent (4i per cent of all respondents) the question for women on dates of marriage and of childrens&apos; births and 22 per cent(3 per cent of all respondents) the questions on occupation and hoursof work; other questions were named by fewer than 20 per cent.* The Harris Random Survev, Louis Harris Research Limited,t The Omnimas Survey, Marketing Advisory Services Limited.28II
5.7 During the Census in 1971, approximately 18 million household forms were issued in Great Britain, and of these some 187,000 (showing personspresent on census day) were returned, normally by post, direct to head-quarter addresses of OPCS and GRO(S). In addition some 55,000forms, recorded in the field as returned direct, had not reachedheadquarters after a reasonable time. In about half of these cases acompleted form was returned in response to a postal reminder, andin respect of the remaining 27,000 cases a sample survey was conductedto find out why no return had been made. At about one quarter of the3,238 addresses surveyed occupants had taken up residence after censusday or there was a vacant dwelling or an absent household. elsewhere the survey revealed a wide variety of circumstances, including casesof uncertainty about the procedures for the return of completed formsand cases where the householder insisted that he had already returneda completed form. On the basis of the information collected in the survey 45,000 persons were added to the enumerated population,representing about 0-09 per cent of the total population.5.8 To provide information on the motives of the householders who returnedtheir forms direct to the Census Office, a short questionnaire was posted to a sample selected from the 177,000 householders in England andWales who, without prompting, had returned forms showing personspresent. The effective response to this questionnaire was 62 per cent(1,640 households). Privacy was the reason mentioned by 32 per cent of respondents (representing an estimated total of 57,000 households),27 per cent (48,000 cases overall) stated that the enumerator did notcall, 21 per cent (37,000) claimed that they were in fact absent on censusnight*, and the remaining 20 per cent (35,000) gave a variety of reasonsnot explicitly connected with privacy, for example, not realising the formswould be collected or expecting to be absent when the enumerator called to collect the form.5.9 In addition to the 57,000 forms posted to headquarters for privacyreasons, a similar number are estimated to have been posted to localcensus officers in order to by-pass enumerators. Thus about 0-6 per cent of all forms were routed to by-pass one or more local officers of the census.* The implication is that some double counting may have occurred as a result of personsbeing enumerated both away from home and at home (though absent). This will be examinedas part of the checks on the accuracy of the census.29
