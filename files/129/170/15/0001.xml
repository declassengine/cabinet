REPORT OF THE DEFENCE LANDS COMMITTEEEXPLANATORY memorandum the Report of the Defence Lands Committee published to-day covers a review of the land held in the United Kingdom by the Armed Forces:(a) for training areas, airfields and ranges wherever situated;(b) for any purpose in National Parks and Areas of OutstandingNatural Beauty; and(c) along the coastline for purposes other than dockyards and portinstallations.2. The Committee examined some 629,000 acres out of a total of 757,000acres in the Defence estate.  Their review covered 465 separate sites.3. In statements in Parliament on 10 May, it was announced that theReport would be published and that there would then be an opportunity for public comment and discussion so that all views expressed can be takenfully into account by the Government in considering the recommendationsof the Report. In view of the size and complexity of the Report, thisexplanatory memorandum is being published simultaneously to focusattention on the main issues raised by the Committee&apos;s recommendations and the factors mentioned by the Committee which the Government will need to take into account in reaching decisions on them.4. The Report is divided into two parts. Part I sets out how theCommittee approached its task, carried out its studies and formed its conclusions; it also contains the Committee&apos;s general recommendations.Part II deals with all the individual Services sites and includes 238 reports on 288 sites with specific recommendations on each.5. The general recommendations in Part I cover the use of land held for Defence purposes, improved access to such land, improvement in theappearance of sites, reduction of noise nuisance and conservation.6. Part II of the Report contains the Committee&apos;s recommendations on the 465 sites covered by the review. The 465 sites included in the review are dealt with as follows:(a) 288 sites are covered by 238 separate reports;(b) 41 further sites, not the subject of separate reports, are included inthe comprehensive report (Annex I to Part II of the Report) on the162 sites of interest to the Nature Conservancy;(c) 136 sites are not featured in site reports. They were not the subjectof representation from civilian sources, nevertheless, as with all theother sites, each was examined by the Committee and Servicewitnesses were called to answer questions about them. The Committeerecognised the Defence requirement for these sites and found no ground for comment about them.
7. These reports briefly indicate the location of each site, or complex of sites, and the extent of the Ministry of Defence land-holding interest;where necessary, the use of Defence land for non-military purposes, e.g.agricultural letting, is also stated. Each Report, with certain exceptionssummarises: the evidence received firstly, from public representations andthen from the Services; any examination by the Committee on the basis of theevidence received; its conclusions and recommendations. The reports arearranged alphabetically in county order, country by country.8. Notes of Dissent to the Committee&apos;s findings have been registered byMr. J. S. Cripps, the Chairman of the Countryside Commission, on eight ofthe site reports covering fifteen sites (see Annex A), these are placedbehind the relevant site reports.9. The main recommendations of the Committee on individual sitesare:(a) The release of some 31,000 acres involving the complete release of40 sites and partial release of areas on a further 57 sites;(b) Improved public access should be granted at 57 sites;(c) In addition 39,000 acres will be given up at Shoeburyness as aresult of the Government^ decision to site the Third London Airportat Maplin;(d) The Committee also endorsed the disposal of certain areas of Defenceland along the coast involving some 16 miles of coastline and1,700 acres;(e) Improved arrangements should be made in respect of amenityand conservation, particularly on training areas.10. In their introduction the Committee draw particular attention totheir recommendations on the following sites:(a) Lulworth. The Committee recommend that the Lulworth rangesof about 7,000 acres (with the exception of the East Holme rifle range)should be released and the RAC Gunnery School should be moved tothe range at castle martin currendy used for RAC continuation firingand by the German Army for tank training. Consultations shouldtake place with the German authorities on how best their future tanktraining requirements can be met. The RAC Training Centre atBovington would remain. Pending the release of Lulworth greaterpublic access should be granted. In making these recommendations,the Committee recognise there will be difficulties in their implement-ation, in particular:(i) the practicability of the RAC Gunnery School sharing the facilidesat castle martin with the German Army (Part II Lulworthreport paragraphs 75-84);(ii) the environmental consideration that would arise at castle martin(Part II Lulworth report paragraph 85);(iii) the estimated heavy cost of the transfer ( 14m Part II,Lulworth report paragraph 91d).
(b) Dartmoor. The Committee recommend improved public access to the Dartmoor training area, the release of 2,400 acres at Okehampton from live firing and the disposal of Rippon Tor rifle range and Plasterdown Camp.

(c) Pentland Hills Training Area, Edinburgh. All live firing should cease at Dreghorn thus permitting uninhibited public access to the northern slopes of the Pentland Hills adjacent to Edinburgh. In order to make this possible a new electric target range should be constructed at Castlelaw where some additional public access could also be arranged.

11. In view of the need to relocate the Proof and Experimental Establishment including the ranges at Shoeburyness following the Government&apos;s decision to site the Third London Airport at Maplin, the Committee were invited by the Secretary of State for Defence to advise on an alternative site for the main research and development facilities at Shoeburyness. After studying reports on 31 possible alternative sites the Committee recommend that the main facilities should be transferred to share with the existing RAF range at Tain, Ross and Cromarty with the acquisition of a further 300 acres.

12. The Government will now be considering the Report and will announce in due course its decisions on the various recommendations.
