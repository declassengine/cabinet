TOWARDS   BETTER   HOMESPROPOSALS   FOR   PEALING   WITH   SCOTLAND&apos;S   OLDER   HOUSINGINTRODUCTION1.     This White Paper outlines the Government1s proposals for an important stage inthe development of those policies referred to in the White Paper, &quot;Homes For People:Scottish Housing Policy in the 1970&apos;s&quot; (Cmnd 5272) which relate to action fordealing with substandard houses.2.     The Government are concerned that increasing attention should be paid to thequality of housing, and that substandard houses still in use in Scotland should bedealt with as quickly as possible.    They have accordingly undertaken a review ofthe policies and procedures, as mentioned in paragraph 27 of Cmnd 5272, aimed firstat devising ways of making the improvement grant scheme a more effective instrument for remedying substandard housing conditions, and secondly at ensuring that theimprovement grant scheme is more closely integrated with other forms of action todeal with houses which range from the inadequate to the intolerable.3.    The broad conclusions of this review are:(a) that new procedures are necessary to enable action to be taken on areasof substandard housing;   and(b) that the improvement grant scheme should now be made to operate moreselectively so as to contribute more directly to the remedying ofsubstandard conditions.After consultations with local authorities and others on the proposals themselves,and on how they should be implemented in detail, legislation to give effect to theproposals will be brought forward as soon as is practicable.SCALE OF THE PROBLEM4.     For over 5* years Scottish housing policies have been dominated by the sub-stantial proportion of houses in the stock which have been unfit for human habitations-tation or, in more recent terms, have been below the minimum tolerable standard.Very substantial progress has been made in dealing with these houses.     Followingslum clearance in the period between the Wars, about 270,004 houses in Scotlandhave been closed or demolished since 1954, when organised slum clearance beganagain.     In addition, over 21,*00 houses are known to have been provided with someor all of the five basic amenities (bath, WC, sink, wash-hand basin, hot water
supply) which they previously lacked, with the assistance of standard grant.Many more houses, out of the 68,000 which have been improved with discretionaryimprovement grant, would have been unfit before their grant-aided improvement.5.    Because of changes in the legislation, it is not possible to make accuratelong-term comparisons of the number of houses in so bad a condition as to requirestatutory action.    Until 19&amp;9 ^he standard by which a house was considered tojustify such action, by way (for example) of closure or demolition, was&quot;unfitness for human habitation&quot;.    This was a largely subjective standard, bywhich the condition of the house was considered in relation to a list ofcriteria related mainly to structure, sanitation and plumbing.    The Housing(Scotland) Act 19^9 abolished the concept of unfitness for human habitation, forall purposes, and substituted a new concept of minimum acceptability, the&quot;tolerable standard&quot;, related to social rather than public health criteria.     Thenew standard, which is set out in detail in Appendix    , was also in much moreobjective terms than the old.    Assessments of the number of slum houses made before and after 1969 are therefore not comparable.6.    Nevertheless, from information available from a number of sources - includingCensus figures, assessments by local authorities under the 19^9 -Act, the Report&quot;Housing in Clydeside 1970&quot;, and the General Household Survey - it is possible tomake a rough estimate of the number of houses in Scotland which still need to bedealt with, as being below the minimum tolerable standard.    The current estimate is 180,000 - 190,000, or about 10^ of the whole stock of houses in Scotland.    this represents, in the main, the houses which lack the most basic amenities - the exclusive use of a WC, a sink, or a hot and cold water supply.     Accordingly itcan be said that a great many of these houses have subsisted for over 50 years ina state which would have justified their closure or demolition as unfit for human habitation in terms of the various Housing (Scotland) Acts which have been in force from time to time during that period.PRESENT PROVISIONS FOR ACTION7.    Section 1 of the Housing (Scotland) j\ct 19^9 placos on local authorities theduty to secure that all houses in their district which do not meet the tolerablestandard are dealt with.     Broadly, the procedures available to the local authorityfor this purpose have provided for the closure of individual houses (by closing
order) j   the demolition of single buildings made up wholly of such houses (bydemolition order);   the clearance of all the buildings in areas in whioh thehouses, or most of them, are below the tolerable standard (by housing treatmentarea action for demolition);   or the improvement of houses in an area of thiskind, so that all the houses in the area will at least meet the tolerablestandard (by housing treatment area action for improvement).     There is no provision in current legislation whereby statutory action can be taken by a localauthority to secure the compulsory improvement of houses which are not below theminimum tolerable standard.     A procedure of this kind did exist, between 1964 and1969, but it was abolished by the 1 9^9 Aot.    Within the statutory procedures of the1966 and 1969 Acts, or separately from them, houses can, however, be improvedvoluntarily with the assistance of standard or discretionary improvement grant.In order to stimulate a greater volume of improvement work in the development areas and intermediate areas of Great Britain (this covers the whole of Scotland),the Government introduced in the Housing Aot 1971, for work completed tjiore23 June 1974, special higher levels of grant payable to private owners and ofGovernment contributions towards those grants or towards the cost of theimprovement of houses owned by local authorities and other public authorities.The results have been outstanding:   the number of private houses approved forstandard grant and improvement grant increased from 3,879 in 19^9 to 16,053 in1972 and f-f in the first quarter of 1973:   snd there was a substantial increasein the rate of improvement of houses owned by public agencies.    More detailsof progress with improvement are given in Appendix .REVIEW OP POLICIES8.    The Government are convinced that the time has come to concentrate special efforts on dealing quickly with the unfit houses which still exist, and thatin general much more emphasis should now be placed on the quality and standards of housing, including the quality of the environment of houses, instead of merelyincreasing the quantity of housing accommodation.    To this end they have undertakena comprehensive review of the provisions relating to both the clearance and theimprovement of older houses.9.    The first broad conclusion from this review has been that it is essentialto deal with bad housing, whei^fewpossible, by areas rather than by individualhouses or single blocks of houses.    Indeed, where the latter kind of actioninvolves olosure or demolition, unless it is very considerately used andco-ordinated by well thought out housing management policies of the local authority,it can oause difficulties and even hardship to the occupants of adjacent houses.
10.      The review suggests that while the present provisions for dealingwith areas of houses which are below the tolerable standard are reasonablyeffective where the purpose is clearance of all the buildings, theyare less effective in securing the improvement of the houses in the area toa reasonable standard.   The Government propose, therefore, to introduceamending legislation to provide for action by areas, and to secure more effective and flexible means of treating the houses in an area byway of demolition, or improvement, or both,11.      The review has also extended to consideration of the wholeimprovement grant scheme, as at present established by the Housing(Financial Provisions) (Scotland) Act 19&amp;8, amended by the Acts of1969, 1971 and 1973*   A consistent principle under the improvement grantscheme, since its intoduction in 1949, has been that all effectualimprovement of houses has been equally welcome, as a contribution to theupgrading of the Scottish housing stock.   Under this policy, the improvementof some 220,000 houses, with the assistance of discretionary improvementgrant, standard grant, or annual payments to local authorities and housing associations, has been secured.   Nevertheless, the housing position inScotland in 1973 is very different from that of 1949.   As has been statedin the recent Report of the Scottish Housing Advisory Committee&quot;Planning For Housing Needs: Pointers Towards A Comprehensive Approach&quot;,the numerical shortage of houses is now no longer significant in many areas, and the &quot;housing problem&quot;, whether of shortage or condition,has become much less a single national problem and much more a seriesof local problems in particular districts.   These considerations clearlypoint to a need now to adapt the improvement grant scheme to make it amore effective instrument for dealing with the surviving substandardhouses.THE GOVERNMENTS PR0P0SAIS12.   The following paragraphs indicate the changes which the government believe are needed to achieve the aims already described.   These are notfinal proposals, nor have they yet been worked out in detail.   TheGovernment will wish to have early consultations with local authoritiesand others concerned with housing in Scotland; and they will also wish
to study the Report of the Environment and Home Office Sub-Committeeof the Expenditure Committee of the House of Commons, which has beenenquiring into the improvement grant scheme and in the process has takenevidence from the Scottish Office and a number of Scottish localauthorities.13.    The proposals are based on the proposition that substandard housing conditions must be dealt with by improvement as well as by clearance.   in suitable circumstances, improvement can both restore to a good standardfor a further useful life some of the houses which have already fallen belowa tolerable standard, and also modernise other substandard houses so thatthey become part of a more varied housing stock for an extended life, oftenperhaps virtually as long as that of a new house.   There is ample and growing evidence in Scotland that many people prefer to live near the centres of towns and cities, and in established communities in the rural areas, in familiar and convenient surroundings, so long as they can doso in houses of good modern standard.   Nor, the Government believe, should there be any question of rigid separation into long-term improvement onthe one hand, and clearance on the other, with no possible forms of actionin between.   Subject to considerations of cost and other relevant factors,what is needed is a fully flexible approach, providing remedies ranging from clearance at one end of the scale &quot;to full, long-term improvement at theother.   In this way the improvement grant scheme can help to ensure thebest form of action with the minimum of disruption of existing communities.For these reasons, the Government&apos;s proposals continue to embody the concept introduced by the 19^9 Act, that clearance and improvement mustboth be considered in deciding upon action to deal with substandardhousing by the statutory processes.HOUSING ACTION AREAS14.    The Government propose, however, that the concept of the housingtreatment area which was introduced by the 1969 Act, and which relatedspecifically to areas of houses which fail to meet the tolerablestandard, should be superseded by the concept of the &quot;housing action area&quot;.Local authorities should be empowered to declare an area to be a housing action area, by reference to a set of criteria relating to the standard
of the housing in the area and, possibly, to the condition of the housingenvironment.   This standard, to be applied for the rfp.clafation of an ai*eaas a housing action area, would have to be determined in detail after-consultation, but it might be on the lines of the twelve-point standardfor improvement grant.   The housing action area, unlike the housingtreatment area, would be a device for identifying an area in which either the remedying of intolerable housing conditions, or the prevention of suchconditions developing, would be achieved by the exercise by the localauthority of special powers designed for and limited to such an area.The size of a housing action area would not be specified in precise terms:to be effective, the area should clearly be neither so unrnqygeably largethat the sharp edge of its purpose was blunted, nor so small that it didnot justify its status.   An area may often almost define itself, inrelation to the situation and conditions requiring attention.   The generalcriteria should if possible be broad enough for dealing with a wide variety of circumstances.15.    A proposal by a local authority for the declaration of an area as a housing action area would be accompanied by the authority&apos;s proposals for theaction contemplated, in the form of an action plan which would take accountof the wider planning considerations.   Since the purpose of the procedure would be to enable local authorities to secure the most effective and appropriate form of action, or combination of forms of action, according tothe circumstances of each area, the action plan could cover clearance,improvement or a combination of clearance and improvement, wherever possible with proposals for the re-use of cleared sites.   To avoid the possibilityof proposals being put forward for the complete clearance of areas wherethe houses were not of unreasonably low standard, there would probably haveto be an intermediate standard by reference to which clearance would become a potential form of action.   Detailed procedures would have to be worked out in consultation, but ihe Government envisage that the authorities1action plans would be notified to all those affected or interested.   the procedures would have to be so devised as to keep to a reasonable minimum the time required for dealing with the proposals.
16.   &quot;Jithin housing action areas, local authorities would have additional powers.In particular they would be able to require owners of houses to improve them to aminimum standard; and to acquire a house, if necessary by compulsion, if afterreasonable opportunity the owner did not take steps to improve it.   On the otherhand the owner of any house in an area declared to be a housing action area wouldbe able to get grant, as of right, towards the cost of the improvement of his house on the same general basis as he can at present get standard grant, and as isproposed generally for the new &quot;intermediate  rant&quot; referred to in paragraph /2l7To help to maintain the supply of rented houses and houses for owner-occupation inrelatively central locations, local authorities would be given every encouragement to sell any houses they might acquire in housing action areas for improvementeither for owner-occupation or for renting - eg by a housing association (Seeparagraph ^247below.)17.   To encourage voluntary improvement activity in housing action areas, and since in many cases owners of houses in this kind of area have limited financial resources, it is proposed that grant for improvement work in action areas, by private owners and public authorities, should be at a higher level than elsewhere,when the higher levels of grant and Government contributions under the housing act 1971 cease in June 1974*   Moreover, since some houses in housing action areasmay require repair, rather than improvement and repair work is sometimes inhibitedby the inability of owners to meet the cost, the Government propose that localauthorities should have a discretion to give grants for repairs only, for houses in housing action areas, if they are satisfied that this is justified havingregard to the condition and standard of the house and the circumstances of theowner,18.   In order to make possible the improvement of houses in a housing action area,where that is the course of action decided upon, it will sometimes be necessary for houses to be vacated so that the work can bo done; and sometimes, particularly intenements, adequate improvement can be carried out only if the number of houses is reduced.   It is proposed that where a local authority has declared an area to be a housing action area, the authority should be under a duty to offer rehousing to anyone who has to be displaced, either temporarily or permanently.7
19.   The Government have been considering the desirability of a measure ofcontrol being given to local authorities over the occupancy of housesimproved with grant.   Until its repeal by the 1972 Act there was a general provision v/ith the broad effect that for a period of 3 years any houseimproved with grant had to be occupied by the original applicant or letto a tenant.   The Government believe that this condition, in its originalform, was an unjustifiable obstacle in the way of improvement.   They believe,however, that some degree of control may be desirable because of the riskof further reduction of the supply of rented houses, and the effect this could have on the availability of housing - for example for people who move from one area to another for reasons of employment.   Subject to consultationthe Government believe that there is a case for giving local authorities a statutory discretion to apply a condition to privately owned rented housesimproved v/ith grant, to the effect that the houses should remain availablefor letting for a specified period.   In addition the Government believe thatthere are many owners who live in houses which do not lack any of the basicamenities and who should be able to carry out any further improvement oftheir houses without help from public funds.   The Government therefore propose, to prohibit the payment of grant, for improvement to a standardabove that applicable to the new intermediate standard referred to inparagraph 21, to owner-occupiers of houses with a rateable valtie above a specified level.   These proposals would apply in all areas includingHousing Action Areas,
OTHER PROPOSALS20.    The Government propose to make a number of changes in theimprovement grant scheme, in addition to the major change represented by the introduction of the housing action area procedure.    the division of the grant scheme into two parts - the standard grantscheme and the improvement grant scheme - no longer seems to bejustified.     It has given rise to some difficulties, because inmany cases a proposal can be regarded as suitable for either standardgrant or improvement grant.     Moreover, the present standard grantprovisions do not take account of repair costs, even if the work of repair is associated with the work of providing the standardamenities which are lacking.     There is some evidence that theimprovement of houses which most need to be improved, by the installation of standard amenities, may be inhibited through the inability of the owners to meet the cost of repairs which may benecessary, and which under the present arrangements may not be grantaided.21.    The Government propose, therefore, to change the structure ofthe grant scheme by removing the specific arrangements for standardgrants and substituting an arrangement for grant at a fixedproportion of approved cost, either for &quot;full standard&quot; improvementor for &quot;intermediate standard&quot; improvement, as may be appropriate.This latter standard would probably be the availability of the fivebasic amenities, plus good repair, and owners would be able to getgrant up to that standard as of right, in broadly the same way asthey can at present get standard grant.     It would, however, bepossible under the new arrangement for repair costs associated withthe provision of standard amenities to be taken into account within limits.    It would be the Government1s intention that there should still be as muoh flexibility as possible in relation to standards,so that houses might be improved to a range of standards, accordingto the circumstances of each case, so long as the outcome was a house modernised to a reasonable standard, with an appropriateexpectation of life.
22.     In accordance with the aim of making the improvement grant schememore effective and contributing to the remedying of substandardhousing conditions, and in order to make more effective use of thepublic funds involved, the Government propose to prohibit the paymentof grant towards tho cost of improving a house which is a second home of the applicant.23.     The Government accept that in a few exceptional cases thepresent level of Exchequer contribution towards expenditure by localauthorities on the improvement of the amenities of predominantlyresidential areas under Seotion 58 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1969may be inadequate.    They therefore propose that the Secretary ofState should have power, in exceptional cases of this kind, to approvean addition to the normal maximum limit of  200 per house eligibleexpenditure on which the Exchequer contribution is calculated,24.    Lastly, the Government will encourage housing associations and housing societies to become as fully involved as possible in action toimprove older houses - in all areas but particularly in housing actionareas.    The supply of rented houses, other than local authority houses,in the older residential areas can in many cases be usefully augmentedby housing associations - including those formed by the residents ofthe area themselves - and full support will be given to this movementthrough the grant scheme, through the appropriate subsidies under theHousing (Financial Provisions)(Scotland) Act 1972, and by the expansionof the role of the Housing Corporation, as referred to in the white paper, &quot;Homes for People:   Scottish Housing Policy in the 1970&apos;s&quot;.SUMMARY25.     In summary, and subject to the consultations which will benecessary, the Government&apos;s proposals are that(i)   the housing treatment areas procedure of the Housing(Scotland) Act 1969 should be replaced by a new procedure for housing action areas;(ii)   local authorities should be encouraged to make maximum useof their general housing powers, within housing action areas;(iii)   looal authorities should be given special lowers withinhousing aotion areas, including a power to require improvementup to a specified standard;(iv)   the proportion of improvement grant within housing aotion areas should be higher than elsewhere, and looal authorities shouldhave a discretion to give grants for repairs only;10.
(v)   local authorities should he made responsible for any rehousingrequired as a result of housing action area proceedings;(vi)   local authorities should be given a power to attach acondition on the occupancy of a house improved with a grant;(vii)   the standard grant scheme and the improvement grant scheme should be merged, and owners should have a right to grant to an &quot;intermediate standardM;(viii)   the payment of grant, for improvement to above the&quot;intermediate standard&quot;, to owner-occupiers of houses with arateable value above a specified level should be prohibited;(ix)   the giving of improvement grant for second homes should be prohibited;   and(x)   the Secretary of State should be empowered to raise themaximum eligible expenditure of  200 per house, for improvement to the amenities of predominantly residentialareas, in exceptional cases;   housing associations should be encouraged to play an increasingly active part in providinghouses for renting, by improvement, particularly in housing action areas.
