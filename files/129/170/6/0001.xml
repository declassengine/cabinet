THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 66 COPY NO        g g8 June 1973CABINETMEMBERS&apos; OUTSIDE FINANCIAL INTERESTSMemorandum by the Lord President of the council. In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 15 February whenmy memorandum (CP(73) 12) concerning Members&apos; outside financial interests was considered, I have since discussed the proposals outlined in that memorandum with the 1922 Committee and its Executive, and with individual Government Members.    I now wish to report to colleagues onthe outcome of these discussions, and to put forward proposals for further action.2.        The proposals which the Cabinet agreed that I should put toConservative members were briefly as follows:-i. the introduction, in the form of two resolutions, of a &quot;code of conduct&quot; on the general lines indicated at Appendix A.    Theseare a modification of those proposed by the Select Committee onMembers1 Interests (Declaration) in 1969;ii. the establishment of a voluntary limited public register ofMembers&apos; outside financial interests.    The draft resolution at appendix B indicates the possible scope of such a register.    in thelight of the previous Cabinet discussion I have now drafted theresolution on the basis that such a register would provide opportunityfor the declaration of any financial interest outside the normal range of &quot;declarable&apos;1 interests if a Member considered such an interest tobe &quot;relevant to a matter before the House&quot;.3.        In the discussions I have had with Government Members there hasbeen general acceptance of the proposal for some form of &quot;code of conduct&quot;,although some doubts have been expressed as to the need for the first of thetwo resolutions at Appendix A.    As regards a register, however, whilstthere was general, if perhaps reluctantB acceptance amongst the executive of the 1922 Committee of the necessity for some form of limited register,the general feeling expressed at the meeting of the 1922 Committee which Iattended on 5 April was firmly against any form of register.    Thisopposition was based on various grounds, eg that a &quot;code of conduct&quot;rendered a register superfluous; that such a register was derogatory tothe House; and that members reasonable privacy would be infringed.
4. It is understood that a sparsely attended meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party on 9 May voted in favour of the establishmentof a compulsory limited register of Members1 financial interests open tothe public, rejecting proposals for such a register to be available for inspection only by officers of the Parliamentary Labour Party and the speaker, which had been put forward by a Party Committee.5. In my view the Governments overall aims in this matter must be:-i. to provide Members with better means of protectingthemselves against unfair imputations of concealed financial motivesin their Parliamentary activities;ii. to reassure the general public that Members1 outsidefinancial interests are &quot;above board&quot; and known;iii. to ensure that the House is not left in doubt as to the standards expected of Members; andiv. to achieve i-iii. with as wide a basis of general agreement in the House as possible, and in a way compatible with themaintenance of Members1 reasonable privacy in financial matters and without discouraging their acceptance of outside employment and business interests.6.        From the soundings I have taken, and from reports of the views ofthe Opposition, it would seem likely that the introduction of some form of&quot;code of conduct&quot; would be generally acceptable in the House.    This might go at least some way towards meeting the objective of clarifying theposition for Members, in accordance with iii. at paragraph 5,    It would,&quot;   however, do little, if anything, to meet the aims at 5i, or ii.Moreover, from the Governments viewpoint, the presentational positionwould be worsened if, in addition to the present Liberal Party register, theLabour Party were to set up, failing all-Party agreement, some form of compulsory register of their own.    My view is accordingly that, both inorder to achieve the aims at paragraph 5, and on general political grounds,Governmental support for some form of public all-Party register isessential.    The mood of the Press and country following Watergate andLonrho, both of which have come to the fore since my discussions with theParty, have convinced me that some form of all-Party register on the lines suggested is the very minimum acceptable to public opinion.7. The Labour Party have now informed me that they are ready to havediscussions.    I shall need to respond before the end of the month.    I must therefore clear a line with my colleagues and then seek to persuade the 1922Committee.8, I would propose in my discussions with the 1922 Committee to stress,apart from the general considerations outlined at paragraph 5:-i. the Government&apos;s intention that any such register should bevoluntary, although in my view the risks of non-disclosure will bevery great;
ii. the limited range of such a register, eg that its normalcoverage would not include property or shareholdings;iii. the pressures that might develop for a compulsory registerif the Labour Party proceed unilaterally;iv. the changed circumstances and mood following Lonrho andWatergate, even though not strictly comparable or relevant.9.        I would accordingly suggest that the basis on which I should seek agreement should be the adoption of a &quot;code of conduct1&apos; confined to paragraph ii. of Appendix A and of a register on the lines indicated inAppendix B.10.       I accordingly seek the agreement of colleagues to my undertakingfurther discussions with Government Members, and in particular with the1922 Committee, on the lines indicated above, letting it be known, as necessary, that the principles and proposals at paragraphs 5 and 9 rep-resent the Governments view as to the general basis on which all-Partydiscussions should proceed.J privy Council Office8 June 19733
