(CO^SDE^niAL)URBAN THAHSPOUT PLANNINGGOVERNMENT OBSERVATIONS ON THE SECOND REPORT OF THE EXPENDITURE COMMITTEEHOUSE OF COMMONS PAPER 57, SESSION 1972/73GENERAL OBSERVATIONS1.   Urban transport is a matter of grov/ing public concern.   The Governmentwelcomes this report, and the evidence the Committee have assembled.2.   Urban transport competes for resources v/ith other sectors of transportexpenditure.   Its needs have to be set in this v/ider context, which theGovernment has at present under review.   The Government&apos;a views, at thisstage of the v/ider examination, on the Committee&apos;s main recommendations are sot out in the following paragraphs.   Replies to the other recommendations are contained in the annex.THE problem.   The Committee&quot;s report is concerned mainly v/ith the conurbations andother large cities in England, and with peak hour journeys to work.   So(1)are the Government&quot;s observations.   In smaller towns the problems are lessacute and more limited measures may suffice.h.   The rapid growth in the ownership of private cars is bringing personaltransport within reach of the majority of people.   It gives them access to a v/ider range cf amenities, and is tangible evidence of on increasinglyprosperous society.   But our larger towns and cities cannot everywhereaccommodate the consequent growth in car journeys, especially peak hourjourneys to city centres.   Even if resources wore unlimited, it would be physically impossible in the largest cities to provide for maximum cor use;and in other towns and cities the attempt to do so would involve a scale ofredevelopment, a change in character and a loss of buildings, some of themarchitecturally and historically important, that most people v/ould findunacceptable.5.   In spite of road buildings and the greater use of traffic management,congestion is spreading-   It causes delay and frustration for travellers;it brings increasing environmental damage for others as drivers try to avoid the clogged arteries by threading their way through side streets and residentialareas.   Moreover, even by the 1980s many people will still be dependenton public transport for some of all of their journeys.   A continuing declinein public transport services would lead to inconvenience or even hardship to those people and weaken the efficient functioning of our towns and cities.Insofar as the Report is relevant, the Government observations ^also apply to Scotland and Wales.
(CONFIDENT IAL)6.   The only practicable way to try to halt those adverse trends is to limit the use of private cars for peuk hour journeys to the centre oflurge tov/no and cities and to ensure that public transport can offer an attractive alternative.(2)PUBLIC TRANSPORT7.   Some cities will need new or improved capital-intensive fixed tracksystems.   In the longer term new means of public transport may have a contribution to make; and the Government is conducting research into them.But in most places public transport will continue for the foreseeable future to mean buses.   To be a sufficiently attractive alternative, buses must boable to compete with the private car in terms of speed and reliability.Local a-     unities will need to consider how the cost to the motorist of a peak-hour journey to the centre relates Ito the cost of the 3ame journeyby bus.   They will need to make wider use of bus priority measures even ifthis involves reduced road capacity for other vehicles.   Wider powers for local authorities to give financial support to bu3 operation were containedin the Local Government Act 1972.   Revenue support to public transport,which will need to maintain incentives to managerial efficiency, would be within the scope of the new grant structure which the Government propose.^RESTRAINT8.   The main means currently available to keep traffic within the capacityof the network and at a level which allows buses to offer a reliable service are regulation of parking space and charging for it.   The Governmentagrees that parking meter zones will need to be enlarged in the centres and major subcentres of conurbations, and charges reviewed regularly tosecure the desired effect on car use.       The Home Secretary announced on19 February that, in order to incite c-uforcement more effective, the Governmentin+en^ed to introduce legislation as soon as possible to make the owner as wellas the driver liable for psrking offences dealt with by the fixed penalty(5) iprocedure.      The Government has under study the methods of restraint which some places may need in the longer term, including roadpricing and area licensing.(2)Recommendation 1 - National policy should be directed towards promoting public transport and discouraging the use of cars for the journey to work in city areas.Recommendation 8 - DOE should make provision for operating subsidies to public trans-port as part of the proposed new grant structure, but these should be arranged in such a way as not to undermine managerial efficiency.(if) ... - I &quot;&apos;    -......&apos;.........:..... .. &apos;  &apos;Recommendation 10 - Parking meter zones should be enlarged to embrace all of thecentre and major sub-centres of each conurbation, and levels of parking charges should be reviewed regularly to secure the desired effect on car use.(5) rRecommendation 16 - The suggestion of the police witnesses and others for theadoption of keeper liability should be implemented. 2
ROADS(6)9.   Even a considerable increase in levels of restraint and assistance for public transport will still leave much traffic on the roadn.   this/ill include through journeys and goods distribution, and local passengerjourneys for v/hich public transport does not provide a cuitablealternative.   Much of the existing road network is unsuited to moderntraffic.   However much is done to restrain car journeys at peak hours and improve public transport, most of our cities will need new and improved roads to provide an adequate network and allow environmentalimprovements in areas from which through traffic should be excluded.   Thoselection of road improvements should have regard both to the extent towhich particular flows can be restrained and to tho help they can give to bus operation.THE ROLE OF CENTRAL GOVERNMENT^10.   How these policies are translated into practical measures on tho groundwill vary from place to place depending on a number of factors.   these include size and population density; the need for environmental protection and the value local people put on this compared with increased mobility;and the existing road and public transport network.   Transport plans for particular places have td be integrated with the wider land use planning of(7)the area and serve planning and social policies. The Local Government.Act puts all the necessary powers and responsibilities in tho hands of thenew county and metropolitan county councils.11.   Tho Government think it is wrong to seek to control in detail thetransport decisions of local authorities. . But they believe that, inaddition to the changes in local government structure, two further changes are needed.   First the new counties should develop comprehensive transportstrategies, bringing together their policies and programmes of expenditure for the county as a whole and for large urban areas within it; secondly,a number of specific central government grants for local transport shouldbe discontinued, and support given instead partly through the needs element/ o \of rate support grant and(in England and Wales       ) partly through a newtransport supplementary grant.   This would be distributed to those authoritieswhose estimates of transport expenditures, as accepted for the purpose, exceedRecommendation 2 - The Department of the Environment should have a positivepolicy for urban transport, laying down a broad approach which it should ensurethat local authorities follow.(7)Recommendation 26 - Transportation studies should be carried out within a clearly defined framework of general policy.There will be corresponding arrangements in Scotland but their form is still being discussed. 3
(9)(10)a prescribed threshold; and in considering these estimates, regard would bo hadto the progress made by authorities in developing and implementing cuitablopolicies for their area.   This will provide a better administrativeframework within which both local and central government can relatebroad policies to the particular needs of particular places and to thoresourceo likely to.be available.12.   Discussions are proceeding with the local authority associations, witha view to introducing the new grant system for 1975/6, subject to thepassage of the necessary legislation.   Having regard to existing commitments,tho Government would expect in tho early years to see a relatively low(9)threshold and a relatively high l-ate of supplementary grant. But theywould also expect the proportion of support distributed through the needselement of rate support grant to increase thereafter, as experience develops.13*   In considering local authorities estimates of expenditure, theDepartment of the Environment would expect to be satisfied that comprehensivepolicies were being developed based on an adequate level of evaluationand study; and that an appropriate range of options had been considered sofar as the time and cost of doing so was warranted.Local authorities will need to look at different combinations of public and private transport,management measures and restraint; and within the resources likely to boavailable in the foreseeable future, face the need for greater restraint of the private car and greater support of public transport than in tho past.By this process, coherent policy objectives will be developed, and these(11)will provide a basis for evolving measures of progress in implementation     .Recommendation 2k - The Department should fix a low &quot;threshold&quot; in order thatthe major proportion of expenditure under the new grant proposals will beby way of supplementary payments rather than in the generalised rate support grant allocation, thus ensuring detailed scrutiny by the Department.   -iRecommendation 28 - Particular attention should be given in future to thepreparation of an adequate range of alternative proposals in the studyprocess. - \^       Recommendation 25 - Department of the Environment approval of expenditure programmes for urban transport should be made dependent on the existenceof definable and explicitly stated planning objectives in the underlyingproposals, the achievement of which the Department would be able to monitor.
&quot;Consideration should be given to relieving taxis from VATby zero rating in the same way as public transport services.&quot;The Government have considered this and have had extenoive discussions with those concerned.   The Chief Secretary to the Treasury has announced the decision that taxi fares should remain subject to the standard rateof VAT (Official Report Vol 852, 6 March, Written Reply 107).   The specialargument for the relief from VAT of other public transport fares - thatthey are an important and well defined area of consumer expenditure figuringlargely in the budgets of lower income families - does:vnot in theGovernment&apos;s view extend sufficiently to taxi fares to warrant similar treatment for them.Recommendation (9)Consideration should be given to rate rebates for firms whichstagger hours.The Government, while recognising the advantages in staggering working hours, do not think this method of encouragement can be adopted.&apos;. .   Local authorities are&quot; under an obligation to levy sufficient rates tomeet their estimated expenditure after allowing for tho receipt of government grant and other income.   Consequently relief for one category of rate payerwould be at the expense of the rest of the rote payers in the area who wouldhave to contribute more.   Moreover rateable value is based on rental value whichdoes not necessarily co-relate at all satisfactorily with the number of employees in a firm.Recommendation (11)Section MK2) of the 196? Road Traffic Regulation Act should be modified so that parking deficits cannot be made good out of the general rate fund.There may be occasions and situations where subsidy in some form may bejustified, for example to encourage the use of a multi-storey park in the initial stages of a controlled parking scheme or where exceptional enforce-ment difficulties, including vandalism against parking meters, results ina deficit in the parking account.   Amendment of tno statute so as to makeany subsidy impossible is therefore inappropriate.
The present practice of cheap long-term contracts for all-dayparking should not be allowed by local authorities when licensingcar parks in central areas.The Government agree v/ith the Committee&apos;s arguments, and will drawthem to the attention of local authorities.Recommendation (13)Enabling legislation should be introduced to permit all localauthorities to license and thus to regulate the operation ofoff-street parking space open to public use.The Government understand that the Greater London Council have met anumber of difficulties in establishing a licensing system under the powersavailable to them in the Transport (London) Act 1969.   In considering thepossible extension to other local authorities of powers for the same purpose,the Government will wish to draw the lessons of the initial licensing schemes which the Greater London Council hope to establish shortly.Recommendation 0*0Instead of obliging commercial developments to provide at least aminimum number of parking places, local authorities should prohibit the provision of more than a severely restricted maximum.Further advice to local authorities in this sense is being prepared.Recommendation (15) - &apos;Consideration should be given to encouraging the transfer   ofprivate parking space to alternative uses by the extinguishment ofexisting user rights, and to taxing non-residential parking space.The GLC are already seeking to persuade firms with the largest privateparking areas to transfer them to alternative uses, or to convert themto public off-street parking where this is needed.   Extinguishment ofexisting user rights is likely to be complicated where the parking spaceforms an integral part of the development.   This however, together withtaxation, will as the Committee recommend be considered further.
(confidential)The Home Office should consider urgently how the powers of thepolice can be strengthened to enable meter feeding to bedetected more effectively.The Metropolitan police do all they can to deal with meter feeding,but do not consider that the difficulties of detection would be reducedby additional powers.Recommendation (18)The level of fine3 for serious parking offenders should boincreased considerably.Within the maximum laid down by Parliament the fine imposed for anyoffence is a&quot; matter for the court.   The question of increasing theexisting maxima, and the level of the fi ed penalty (which is not a fine),is being considered.Recommendation (19)Local authoritier- should be encouraged to make more widespreaduse of pedestrian precints.-   The Government accepts this recommendation.   A bulletin of advice,to encourage the introduction of still more such schemes is to beprepared.Recommendation (20)Local authorities should be further required to lay down specificroutes for heavy lorries to follow, and be encouraged to establishspecial parks for the overnight garaging of heavy vehicles intheir areas.The Heavy Commercial Vehicles (Controls and Regulations) Bill, aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill now before Parliament, would if passed in itspresent form effect amendments to the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1967enabling local authorities to specify routes for heavy lorries and prohibitor restrict them from particular areas for reasons of amenity, and wouldlay a duty on the new county authorities to formulate proposals by 1977 forthe control of heavy lorries in their areas.   The legislation would provideboth the powers and the duties which the Committee advocate, and theGovernment has welcomed these provisions in the Bill.
(confidential^Highway Authorities have power under Section j50 of the Highways Act1971 to provide lorry areas for the&quot; parking of heavy goods vehicles and other purposes.   Advice is to be issued shortly encouraging local authorities toestablish such local lorry parks.   They would be additional to the proposed national network of strategically sited lorry parks which the department is setting up to provide for the long distance lorry.Recommendation (2l)Further study should be made of the suggestion of a shift oftaxation from the annual licence to petrol tax.The Committee&apos;s views will bo kept in mind in further examinationof measures directed to affecting the balance between car use and public transport in urban areas.   The Government have noted that the evidence to the Committee brought out that such a shift in taxation would havewider effects which would also need to be considered.Recommendation (22)As an urgent priority, all trunk and principal schemes of urbanroad building which have not reached the exchange of contractstage should be re-examined ab initio.The Government share the Committee&apos;s view that the conurbations and major cities will need to give greater priority to measures to favourpublic transport.   The proposed changes in the central government grants for local transport, and the preparation by local authorities of comprehensive transport policies and programmes on which the allocation of the new supplementary grant will be based, will set in train a review by each authority of their expenditure priorities.   Meanwhile the department has asked authorities to review all schemes in the light of the UrbanMotorway Committee&apos;s report, and will be giving close scrutiny to allprincipal road schemes as they come forward to commitments.   The department is also reviewing it3 trunk road schemes in urban areas against the samecriteria.   But the Government think it would be unjustifiable to impose on all schemes in an advanced state of preparation the delay implied by are-examination ab initio such as the Committee recommend.   To do so would merely defer benefits the schemes are designed to secure, for exampleremoval of traffic including heavy goods vehicles from streets whore theyhave no place.
The Department should incorporate the grant for new buses intothe new grant system, after holding discussions with the public transport operators.The Government recognise the arguments for moving in this direction.But they also have to recognise that the extension of the new bus grantuntil 1980, which Parliament approved in 1971) is important both to the investment plans of manufacturers and to the purchasing plans of operatorsFurthermore, from April 197** the new non-metropolitan counties will havewholly new duties in relation to the planning and support of public transport; it would be premature to withdraw from operators the supportprovided by the new bus grant before it can be seen how local authoritysupport develops and what problems (eg on cross boundary services) emerge.
(^CONFIDENTIAL) -Priority should be given to research into the follov/ing possibledeficiencies of the transportation otudy method:i.   its inability to predict how many people will be deterred fromtravelling under certain restrictions;ii.   its inadequacy in predicting how many people might make uso ofnew or improved public transport facilities.There are deficiencies in the transportation study process andthose mentioned by the Committee will be included in the Department&apos;sresearch programme.   One difficulty in developing this research programme in a systematic way is to determine the sensitivity of transportationstudy outputs to variation in a number of assumptions and techniques.The Department is considering how best to establish the priorities for research into improved techniques, including the need to develop quickerand simpler modelling procedures for examining a greater range of options,Recommendation (29)The proportion of existing schemes considered as firm commitments,both highway and public transport, should be kept to an absoluteminimum when considering new plans.The Government agree.   Inclusion of a schema in the preparation listwhich is periodically announced by the Secretary of State is not a firm commitment without further and adequate appraisal and evaluation of thescheme itself, its wider implications, and a comparison with alternative proposals. &apos;Recommendation (30)The assumptions made and the methods used in the transportationstudies should be made more comprehensible to tho layman.The transportation study process is a complex one.   The methods usedrequire specialist knowledge and are not readily or helpfully expressedin simple terms.   But the assumptions made in defining the options to be tested, and for the results of the analytical process, need to bo made more intelligible to the layman and to those responsible for policy decisions,   Thi3 will require a clear definition of the range of options tobe tested, a statement of the limitations of the methodology for the examination of particular problems, and a statement of the impact of differentoptions on other community objectives,   The Department will encourage this.
Recommendation (31)The allocation of urban transport planning responsibilities amongDepartment of the Environment Ministers should be reconsidered.Recommendation (32)The Directorates reporting to the Chief Planner in DOE should have responsibility for all tho relevant planning and financing of urbanhighways.Recommendation (33)The Highways Directorates should only have responsibility for thointer-urban road programme, and urban road design should be supervisedby a directorate within the aegis of the group of Directorates underthe Chief Planner.The Secretary of State has overall responsibility for all the workof the Department.   The present division of responsibilities at ministerial level provides that the Minister for Transport Industries deals withtransportation policy (including roads and traffic management), and theMinister for Local Government and Development with land use planning.   the secretary of State will be reviewing Ministerial responsibilities forurban matters in the light of changes stemming from the proposed new grantsys tern.&apos;.l      The proposed new grant system implies two fundamental changes in the approach of DOE and local authorities to urban transport planning matters.It envisages much greater freedom for local authorities from detailed centralgovernment control, and it seeks to promote the development and implementation of comprehensive transport policies by local authorities.   These changesraise important organisational questions within DOE which are being examined in detail.   The views of the Committee are being kept in mind.Recommendation (3l0The urban roads programme should be abolished and replaced by anurban transport programme linked to the comprehensive plans requiredin the context of the new grant proposals.This will be the position   with     the new grant proposals, underwhich the principal road preparation list nnd firm programme will disappear.
Recommendation (35)The Department of the Environment should encourage local authoritiesto institute public attitude surveys, and should carry out some ofits own in the larger urban areas.1.    The procedure for the preparation of structure plans, which includesstrategic transport planning, calls for local authorities to consult thepublic about their proposals.   When submitted to the Secretary of State,draft plans must be accompanied by a statement setting out what thoauthority have done about participation..2.     A Departmental research programme is now being mounted in which thepublic participation processes of a number of structure plans will bemonitored and evaluated by independent assessors.   Public attitude sur,and other market research techniques are being used within this research programme.Recommendation (36)The Department should seek to increase the proportion of personnelv/ith a sociological and market research background in itsDirectorates which relate to urban transport planning.1.     The Department recognises the need for sociological and marketresearch expertise in carrying out its responsibilities in tho field of urban transport.   It supplements its own staff resources by engagingconsultants to carry out specific tasks.Recommendation (37)The Department of the Environment should institute discussions v/iththo various research agencies, both public and private, with n viewto establishing a central organisation for tho collection anddissemination of research in thi3 field.1.     The International Road Research Documentation scheme (IRRD) providesthis service in the field of road research.   It is based on abstractingcentres in France, Germany and the Transport and Road Research Laboratory andlinked to similar services in the USA,   It is to be expanded to embracewider aspects of tr^isuort.   Urban planning and related economic and socialaspects of transport are covered by the Department of the Environment Librarycentral record of research in continuation of the Royal Town PlanningInstituted Research Register.   The Department is developing a service toco-ordinate the collection and dissemination of research information by its headquarters Library, the Transport and Road Research Laboratory and the .Building Research Establishment, and is keeping the situation under review.
An examination should be made urgently into the desirabilityof handing over to the relevant PTAs those NBC operations which fall wholly or mainly within the PTA areas.The Transport Act 1968 provides for local negotiations to produceagreements which fit the local circumstances, and the Government believethat this is the right way to proceed.   The NBC companies operate both within and outside the PTA Areas, and the outer services are oftendependent on the inside services both financially and operationally.The situation varies from place to place and different arrangements are needed to cover the variations.  . .     - .
