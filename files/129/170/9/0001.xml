THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 69 COPY NO        V15 June 1973CABINETRHODESIA:  SETTLEMENT PROSPECTS AND continuation of SANCTIONSNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth affairs, The Ministerial Committee on Rhodesia decided on 8 May thats anctions should be continued if we have not secured a settlement withRhodesia by November.    The question of the timing of an announcement tothis effect was left for further consideration.2. On 23 May Mr Ian Smith sent his Cabinet Secretary and anotherofficial k.o see me.    They reported that Mr Smith&apos;s attempt to reach anagreement with the African National Council (ANC) had broken down; thathe would not consider modifying the 1971 Settlement Proposals but that he believed that there had been a very substantial change of mind on the part ofthe Africans and that &quot;a majority of responsible Africans&quot; would support them were it not for ANC intimidation.    Mr Smith wants to know whether we would be prepared to go ahead with the settlement if he after duepreparation were to arrange for a number of &quot;responsible&quot; Africans to seems privately in Salisbury and express support for the 1971 terms.    I saidthat I did not see how I could carry conviction unless he could bring alongBishop Muzorewa and some of the more responsible of the ANG whoundoubtedly represent a lot of African opinion.3.        I do not believe that Mr Smith will in practice be able to produceconvincing evidence that sufficient Africans want the 1971 terms as they stand.    If I am right about this it follows that until he and the Africans are more ready to compromise, and preferably to work out together someagreed variant of the 1971 terms, I see little prospect of being able to convince Parliament here that the Fifth Principle has been satisfied.    Thegreat majority of Africans may have changed their minds but there is littleexcept Mr smith s statement to suggest that they would support the 1971settlement unamended.4.        We must therefore reply with caution to Mr Smith&apos;s enquiry.   i suggest that we should do so in the terms set out in Annex A to this paper.One of our difficulties is lack of firsthand knowledge.    I have thereforetold Mr Smith that I shall send Sir Denis Greenhill to Salisbury with our
reply.    Sir Denis Greenhill will be able to ensure that our views areaccurately presented to Mr Smith, to tell him in particular that in our viewsome alteration must be made in the 1971 Settlement terms to secureAfrican support and to form an independent assessment of his position andthose of Bishop Musorewa and other &quot;responsible&quot; Africans.5.        I come now to sanctions.   If we could get a settlement includingconvincing African support we could then legislate in Parliament, to tothe United Nations and say we had fulfilled our responsibility and dropsanctions.    That is a clear course of action.    I see little attractionhowever in dropping sanctions without the prize.    The economic and legalarguments against dropping them are set out in Annex B to this paper.There is also the consideration that the dropping of sanctions wouldfollowing the border incidents almost certainly accelerate racial tensionand violence in and around Rhodesia.    Nor could we now be sure of gettingParliament to approve a decision to drop sanctions in the absence of asettlement.    If we have not reached an agreement by this autumn we shallstill have some options open to us (apart from the possibility of politicalchanges within Rhodesia) such as threatening to drop our colonialresponsibility if the two siaes fail to reach agreement within a certainperiod, or putting forward new proposals ourselves.    These possibilitieswill have to be examined further, but all of them involve the renewal of sanctions in November.6.        Such an announcement will evoke some opposition whenever it ismade.    There are strong arguments for announcing fairly soon our readiness to continue sanctions if necessary.    I have undertaken to meetthe Parliamentary Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs Committee in theHouse of Commons and an equivalent Committee in the House of Lordsbefore the summer Recess to discuss Rhodesia and sanctions,    I will haveto make our position clear at these meetings and before that I must seeselected groups of Members of Parliament in private to explain ourreasoning-    I believe it is important that the economic and legal aspectsshould be carefully explained,7.        Suspicion of our intentions wiU build up if we delay an announcementtoo long.    This could be tiresome at the Commonwealth Conference in ottawa in August.    In any case, I should like Sir Denis Greenhill to beable to tell Mr Smith in Salisbury that we will continue sanctions ifnecessary, and it would be advisable to make a public announcement fairlysoon after Sir Denis&apos;s return.8,        In the light of these considerations I ask my colleagues to approve the following course of actiona. We should continue our efforts to promote compromise between Europeans and Africans in Rhodesia and to secure anagreement with Mr Smith which we can commend to Parliament.
b. If we fail to do so in time we should renew the SanctionsOrder in November,c. I should announce our readiness to do this at about the endof June, in the context of the various discussions described inparagraphs 5 and 6 above.d. I should reply to Mr Smith5s enquiry about testing african opinion on the lines suggested in Annex A to thie paper and should send Sir Denis Greenhill to present the reply and probe attitudesin Rhodesia as best he cen.A D-foreign and Commonwealth Office14 June 1973
Annex a proposed lines of a renly to Mr Smith&apos;senquiry about testing African support for a settlementi.    In order to satisfy ourselves and the british parliament that v/e were justified in grantingindependence to Rhodesia we should need convincing evidence of African support for any settlement;ii.    this would mean that a representative cross-sectionof Africans would have to express support for asettlement in a way which would carry conviction;iii.    in order to satisfy our objection in (i) aboveany such cross-section of African opinion wouldhave to include at least Bishop Muzorewa and themore moderate elements of the ANC;iv.    the actual method of testing opinion wouldhave to be decided in the light of circumstancesat the time, but we do not rule out a visit to salisbury by the Foreign and commonwealth secretary, or someone else, on the lines suggested by Mr Smith.
Annex BThe Repercussions of Dropping; Sanctions1.   POSSIBLE ECONOMIC LOSSESTradeOur trade with black Africa is about  800m a year - half ofit in exports.InvestmentInvestment in black Africa (other than oil, banking and insurancewas about  400m (book value) at the end of 197*1.   Interests, profits and dividends, associated with these investments are about  50m ayear (half of which is reinvested).    Invisible earnings are about  30ma year.   There are outstanding export credits of  350m and outstandingaid loans of  215m.Investment in Nigerian oil is about  350m and we are investingat about  1-Jm a week.   Profits are about  1^-m a week.These interests are concentrated in a few countries, a third in nigeria (excluding oil) and another third in Zambia, Kenya and Ghana.Possible measures against us (Nigeria has already made a study ofoptions and her reaction is crucial) include a national boycott ofBritish exports, denial of public contracts, a discriminatory surcharge on British goods, discriminatory indigenisation of British enterprises,exchange control restrictions, employment restrictions affectingpresent and future British investment, restrictions affecting otherinvisibles, difficulties over air traffic agreements - includingConcorde, and refusal to compromise over legal participation inBritish oil interests in Nigeria.   It is impossible to be certain towhat extent retaliatory action would be taken - clearly this would vary from country to country, but the estimate we can make is that we mighthave a real income loss of  50m to  120m in the first year made up asfollows:-OilGeneralExport Earnings     ......Additional Import Costs ...Invisible and other EarningsNigerian Oil Earnings     ... 4m to  10m 10m 27m to  54m 10m to  50m/This
This would probably continue at that level for at least three yearsand probably for longer since lost export markets cannot be regainedeasily and nationalisation is irreversible.   There is, furthermore,the possibility that Kenya might make the dropping of sanctions an excuse for quickly speeding up the expulsion of the Asians with british passports.2.     POSSIBLE ECONOMIC GAINSThe gain in real income terms resulting from a dropping of sanctions against Rhodesia is estimated to be about  12m in the first year (export earnings  1m, savings on imports  2m, invisibles  8m,direct savings  1m).   But perhaps eventually  22m a year.   Our tradewith South Africa, and our investment there, would continue as atpresent.3.      INTERNATIONAL OPINION AND THE UNIf we drop sanctions without a settlement with Mr Smith theopinion of the Law Officers is that we should be in breach ofArticle 25 of the Charter of the United Nations.   This is one of the basic provisions of the Charter under which members undertake tocarry out the decisions of the Security Council.   The Law Officersbelieve that the International Court of Justice would conclude that wehad broken this article and that we would have no reasonable argumentsto put forward.   The Afro-Asian world would have a field day at ourexpense, our friends would be unaole to help us and would be mostembarrassed, and we would have difficulty in putting forward anyarguments in the future about the rule of law (eg Iceland).   Wewould have to use our veto, probably repeatedly, in the security council and we would probably face an emergency meeting of theGeneral Assembly where we would be in a minority of three (togetherwith South Africa and Portugal).    Our standing in other international bodies would be adversely affected.   A conservative government would have flagrantly &quot;broken a major tenet ofInternational Law.2
