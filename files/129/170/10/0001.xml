introduction. International law on fisheries will be considered in 1974 at the united nations Law of the Sea Conference. The British Government will play a fulland constructive part in that Conference and hope to see emerge from it asystem which will safeguard the rights and interests both of coastal states and of states which have traditionally depended on distant water fisheries. It is in this context that they believe that the long-term problem of fisheries off Iceland shouldbe settled. In the short term, they believe that the regulation of fisheriesoutside national zones of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction is a matter whichshould be agreed between the governments concerned either bilaterally or through the appropriate international organisation, in the case of fisheriesoil Iceland, the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. The icelandic government has however sought to settle the matter unilaterally by nationallegislation*. This is the origin of the dispute.background. The waters in the Iceland area constitute by far the most important ofthe United Kingdom distant water fishing grounds and one of the longestestablished. The United Kingdom catches only demersal or &quot;bottom-feeding&quot;fish there. Over the past 5 years and indeed over the past 50 years, leaving aside the war period, the British catch has averaged about 170,000 metric tons a year.(For details of British, Icelandic and total catches in the Icelandic area since1950, see Annex C.) Of the fish caught by British vessels by far the most important is cod which formed over 75% of the catch in 1971. The total catch by british vessels in the area over the last ten years has been worth about  13 million annually. This represents about half the value of all United Kingdom land-ings of demersal fish from distant waters and some 20% of all the freshand frozen fish landed by British fishing vessels. There are about 190 british vessels which have fished in the area at some time during recent years.They come mainly from Hull, Grimsby and Fleetwood, but from NorthShields and Aberdeen as well. Over 90% by weight of the catch is normallytaken by &quot;fresher&quot; trawlers, that is to say, by vessels which have no facilitiesfor freezing fish at sea and are thus limited to voyages of not more than3 weeks. The freezer trawlers are mainly intermittent visitors to the Iceland area as they have the capacity to stay at sea for long periods and tofish other grounds in the North Atlantic. It is not possible, however, for themain fishing effort from the Icelandic area to be diverted at economic levelsto other fishing grounds. Some are too distant for the smaller trawlers. others are already fully exploited, and in many cases catch quotas of the form thatthe British Government would wish to see applied to the Iceland area arealready in force. Certainly none of them could be looked upon as a potentialalternative source of supply for the quantities of white fish at present obtainedfrom the Icelandic region. A phase-out period of the kind suggested at onestage by the Icelandic Government, by excluding British fishing vessels fromthese waters, would have virtually destroyed the life of three British fishingports.* Some of the arguments by which the Icelandic Government have sought to justify thispolicy are considered at Annex b.
3. Between 1958 and 1961 the United Kingdom and Iceland were in dispute over Iceland&apos;s right to extend her fisheries jurisdiction from 4 to 12 miles. this dispute was settled by an Exchange of Notes between the two Governments,dated 11 March 1961 (Cmnd 1328). Under this Agreement, the British Govern-ment withdrew their objections to the 12-mile limit, in return for a three-yearphasing-out period during which British ships continued to fish in a part of the12-mile zone. The Agreement also contained the following clause:&quot;The Icelandic Government will continue to work for the implementation of the Althing Resolution of 5 May 1959, regarding the extension of fisheriesjurisdiction around Iceland, but shall give to the United Kingdom Govern-ment six months&apos; notice of such extension and, in case of a dispute in relationto such extension, the matter shall, at the request of either party, be referredto the International Court of Justice.&quot;4.   On 14 July 1971 a policy statement was issued by the Government of iceland which included the following passage:&quot;Territorial watersThe Fisheries Agreements with the United Kingdom and the federal german Republic shall be terminated and a resolution be made about anextension of the fishery limit up to 50 nautical miles from the baselines,effective not later than 1 September 1972.&quot;On 17 July 1971 H.M. Ambassador in Reykjavik delivered to the icelandic government an aide-memoire which expressed the British Governments con-cern at this statement, reminded the Icelandic Government of the provision ofthe 1961 Agreement relating to the reference of disputes to the international court, pointed out that that Agreement was not open to unilateral denunciationor termination, and reserved the rights of the British Government under theAgreement. (See Annex A, Document 1.)history of the present negotiations5. The two Governments then entered into bilateral discussions. These fellbroadly into three phases.6. During the first of these, from 18 August 1971 to 14 April 1972,the BritishGovernment sought to persuade the Icelandic Government that the proposed extension would have no basis in International Law and that if a need forimmediate measures to conserve fish stocks around Iceland could be demon-demonstrated, such measures could be discussed with other interested States eitherwithin or outside the framework of the appropriate international organisation,the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission. After a first meeting between ministers of the two Governments in London on 18 August 1971 further meetingswere held between officials in London and in Reykjavik. During the course ofthese the British delegation offered, as an alternative to the extension of Ice-landic limits and pending the conclusion of suitable multilateral conservationmeasures, to limit the total British catch of demersal fish to the average taken byBritish vessels from the area in the years 1960-1969, i.e. 185,000 metric tons perannum (as against an estimated 208,000 metric tons for the year 1971) (see AnnexA, Document 2). The Icelandic Government were not, however, prepared tonegotiate further on this basis. They maintained their intention to extend theirfisheries jurisdiction and were not prepared to enter into a detailed discussion
on the need for conservation. In these circumstances the British government decided in accordance with the 1961 Agreement to institute proceedings withthe International Court of Justice (see paragraph 9 below).7. The second phase of discussions with the Government of Iceland wasconducted with the objective of reaching satisfactory practical arrangements forthe period while the British case was before the International Court of Justice(see Annex A, Document 3). Both Governments agreed that during this phasethe fundamental question of Iceland&apos;s right to extend fisheries jurisdiction shouldbe left on one side and the objective would be an interim arrangement whichwould not prejudice the views of either side on the substantive issue before theCourt. A preliminary round of dicussions was held at official level on 19-20April 1972 in Reykjavik and subsequently there were Ministerial meetings inLondon on 24-25 May and 19-20 June and in Reykjavik on 11-12 July. during these meetings the British delegation first proposed that an interim arrangement should be based on the catch limitation previously suggested, i.e. 185,000 tonsa year. In order to give Iceland a degree of preferential treatment it was proposedthat there should be no corresponding restriction on the catch of Icelandicvessels. The Icelandic delegation, however, insisted upon the need for a physicalreduction in the British fishing fleet. The British delegation accordingly putforward a modified proposal to limit the number of effective fishing days byBritish vessels in the disputed area. This however was also rejected by the icelandic delegation as a basis for negotiation. The British delegation subse-quently agreed to consider an arrangement of closed and open areas based onan Icelandic counter-proposal. At the July meetings Icelandic Ministers saidthat they could in principle be satisfied with an arrangement of this type whichreduced the British catch by 25% from the 1971 level, i.e. to 156,000 tons, butthey would not discuss it in detail and broke off negotiations saying theycould no longer delay the publication of regulations enforcing the 50-mile limit from 1 September.8. The Icelandic Government then published its regulations and, despitean Order from the International Court of Justice, enjoining Iceland not toenforce the 50-mile limit against British vessels, they began systematic harass-ment of British trawlers. Against this background, a third phase of negotiationsthen took place, between 5 October 1972 and 4 May 1973, to work out interimmeasures pending a settlement of the substantive dispute (see Annex A, Docu-ments 4-9). During these negotiations more progress was made. It was agreedinter alia that an interim arrangement should be based primarily on a limitationof the tonnage of fish caught by British vessels, that the other provisions shouldnot be such as to frustrate the possibility of reaching the agreed catch limitationand that the whole arrangement should be without prejudice to the position orrights of either Government in relation to the extension of Icelandic fishinglimits to 50 miles. During the course of negotiation it was also agreed that thetonnage limitation should fall within a range of 117,000 tons (the Icelandicproposal) and 155,000 tons (a proposal by Britain), i.e. 1,000 tons less than the25% reduction in the 1971 catch level with which Icelandic Ministers had earliersaid they would be satisfied. A catch limit of 117,000 tons, on the other hand,would have had a very serious effect on the British fishing portsconcerned. The Icelandic delegation refused to advance from their first and only
offer of 117,000 tons although the British delegation, as a compromise, proposed a figure of 145,000 which also represented an approximate mid-point betweenthe Icelandic offer and the figure of 170,000 tons established by the international court (see paragraph 9 below). The British Delegation nevertheless put forwarddetailed proposals combining a catch limit of 145,000 tons with restrictions onthe areas to be fished and also on the vessels to be operated. The icelandic government were not at that stage prepared to take the negotiations furtherbut undertook to study the British proposals. These proposals, the full text of which is at Annex A, Document 9 remain open.THE INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE9. The proceedings before the International Court of Justice are based onthe 1961 Agreement referred to above. The decision to institute them was taken at the end of the first phase of negotiations when it had become clear that the icelandic Government were not prepared to consider any negotiated alternative to an extension of their fisheries jurisdiction. Consequently, on 14 April 1972,the United Kingdom asked the Court to Adjudge and Declare:(a) that there is no foundation in international law for the claim by Icelandto be entitled to extend its fisheries jurisdiction by establishing a zone ofexclusive fisheries jurisdiction extending to 50 nautical miles frombaselines and that its claim is therefore invalid; and(b) that questions concerning the conservation of fish stocks in the watersaround Iceland are not susceptible in international law to regulation bythe unilateral extension by Iceland of its exclusive fisheries jurisdictionto 50 nautical miles from baselines but are matters that may be regulated,as between Iceland and the United Kingdom, by arrangements between those two countries, whether or not together with other interested coun-tries and whether in the form of arrangements reached in accordancewith the North East Atlantic Fisheries Convention of 24 January1959, or in the form of arrangements for collaboration in accordancewith the Resolution on Special Situations relating to Coastal Fisheriesof 26 April 1958, or otherwise in the form of arrangements betweenthem that give effect to the continuing rights and interests of both ofthem in the fisheries of the waters in question.When the Icelandic Government nevertheless proceeded to publish regula-tions enforcing a 50-mile limit, the British Government made an applicationto the Court to indicate interim measures for the protection of the partiespending its substantive judgment. In response to this application the Court,by a majority of 14 votes to 1, made an Order on 17 August 1972 to theeffect that both Governments should ensure that no action of any kind wastaken which might aggravate or extend the dispute, that the icelandic government should refrain from enforcing its regulations against british vessels fishing outside the 12-mile zone or from applying administrative,judicial or other measures against these vessels; and that the United King-dom should ensure that the annual catch by its vessels was not more than170,000 metric tons of fish. (See Annex D). The Order is open to review atthe request of either party at an appropriate time before 15 August 1973.10.  The Icelandic Government alleged in various communications that
there was no basis under the Statute of the Court for exercising jurisdiction inthe case. However, on 2 February 1973 the Court decided by a majority of 14votes to 1 that it did have jurisdiction and ordered the British Governmentto submit its memorial on the substance of the case by 1 August 1973. the icelandic Government has until 15 January 1974 to submit its reply.11. The British Government have made regulations to ensure that thecatch limit ordered by the International Court is complied with by british vessels and have taken care to comply in all respects with the Order of theCourt, taking only such measures to counter Icelandic interference as are essential to enable British vessels to catch up to the authorised limit.ICELANDIC HARASSMENT12. The Government of Iceland, in defiance of the Order of the international court, have consistently sought by the use of force to prevent British vessels fromfishing within 50 miles of Iceland. Icelandic coastguard vessels have orderedBritish trawlers to cease fishing within the area and when they did not complyhave used cutting gear to sever the warps holding the nets. This operation hasinvolved manoeuvring in dangerous proximity to fishing vessels, wholly con-trary to normal navigational rules, and has resulted in several collisions. Therehave been some 50 warp-cutting incidents up to May 1973 (see Annex E).Gear to an estimated value of  48,300 has been lost and normal fishing operationsdisrupted.13. In the course of this harassment Icelandic coastguard vessels have usedboth blank and live ammunition, and have also fired rounds dangerouslynear to British vessels. On one occasion a coastguard vessel fired a numberof rifle shots hitting the bridges of two trawlers. Prior to the decision to providenaval protection, there had been in all some twenty incidents involving gunor rifle fire by Icelandic coastguard vessels (see Annex F). Threats have also beenmade of attempts to board and Icelandic Ministers have publicly threatenedphysical seizure of British vessels.14. The British Government have repeatedly protested against suchharassment and have lodged claims in respect of the damage caused.support operations15. The Icelandic Government ignored all protests and indicated publiclytheir intention to continue harassment. The British Government thereforechartered on 19 January 1973 an ocean-going tug, the &quot;Statesman&quot;, whichwas subsequently joined by three other tugs, the &quot;Englishman&quot;, &quot;Irish-man&quot; and &quot;Lloydsman&quot;, whose task was to shield British trawlers frominterference. These vessels are unarmed and operate in a purely defensivecapacity. Their captains are instructed to comply with normal navigationalrules. These are additions, of course, to the normal support ships which even before and throughout the dispute have supplied invaluable technical and medical assistance and meteorological reports to the fishing fleet.16. It is normal for a naval fishing protection vessel to be available toassist trawlers in the Icelandic area. Since the beginning of the Icelandic harass-ment one or more naval vessels have been in the general area but in order tocreate a more favourable climate for negotiations they were for as long as possible
kept outside the disputed zone. However, on 14 May, there was a serious incident in the course of which an Icelandic coastguard vessel, the &quot;Tyr&quot;,threatened to board the trawler &quot;Lord Alexander&quot; and fired a live round very close to the trawler &quot;Macbeth&quot; who came to her assistance. As a result of this and other incidents on the same day and the concentration of five Icelandiccoastguard vessels around the main British trawler fleet, the industry concluded that vessels could no longer safely exercise their right to fish in the area withoutnaval protection. Accordingly, on 19 May, the Government ordered naval vessels to provide protection against further harassment.THE CONSERVATION AND UTILIZATION OF FISH STOCKS17. There are sharply differing views on the conservation and utilizationof the stocks of fish on the continental shelf of Iceland. It is important to dis-distinguish between the two issues. The Icelandic Government claim that it isnecessary for them to have control over the fisheries because the stocks arebeing over-exploited, and only national measures can protect them. They alsoclaim that the exceptional dependence of Iceland on the fishing industry givesthem a special interest, amounting to a right in equity not only to sole res-ponsibility for the management of the fisheries but also to take all the fishabove the continental shelf of Iceland (subject to whatever short-term transitional arrangements they may concede).18. A study of the facts shows that stocks are not in imminent danger, andthat existing international arrangements are fully adequate to ensure their proper management. Iceland&apos;s special interest in the stocks, whoever has theresponsibility for their conservation, is fully acceptable as justifying some prioritytreatment, and a degree of coastal state preference is a standard element in international management measures. But the British Government are notprepared to accept that this priority should be extended to permit Icelandto take all the fish to the complete exclusion of other traditional fishingcountries.19. The position on the conservation of the stocks is set out more fully in Annex G. The United Kingdom Government have at all times been anxiousto safeguard the stocks on which the British industry and consumer depend soheavily, and have co-operated fully in the work of the North East atlantic fisheries Commission in this respect. The present position of the demersalstocks around Iceland is very widely accepted to be that they are, in general,fully exploited, though not overfished. However, the risk of overfishing could arise if the fisheries were further exploited, despite the existence of internationally-agreed restrictions on mesh size and the minimum size of fish. A catch limitationagreement would be the most effective means of ensuring that the risk did notarise, and a proposal for such a measure was put to the Icelandic government at the outset (see paragraph 6 above). Unfortunately, it will not now be possibleto take such measures within the formal framework of N.E.A.F.C., for at thelast meeting of the Commission in May 1973 the Icelandic delegation renounceda previous undertaking and refused to ratify an agreement adding catch and effortlimitation agreements to the list of measures which the Commission is empoweredto employ. This prevents, for the meantime, the Commission using this highlyeffective management device not only in the Iceland area but also throughout
the North-East Atlantic. However, catch limitation agreements can be and arebeing negotiated outside the formal framework of N.E.A.F.C., and the UnitedKingdom and Germany are observing catch ceilings set by the international court. So far as foreign vessels are concerned, therefore, there is a satisfac-tory catch limit action scheme in effect. As shown in paragraph 8 above, the icelandic Government have accepted that catch limitation should be the basis for an interim agreement, and the United Kingdom Government have madeoffers considerably below the figure set by the Court. They have also indicated that an acceptable agreement could include the closure to trawling of certainspawning or nursery areas. They have also indicated readiness to considerspecial arrangements for designated areas in which smaller Icelandic vessels,using non-trawling gear, habitually fish.20. Thus, the conservation position is currently safeguarded by mesh andsize regulations stemming from N.E.A.F.C. and a catch limitation imposed bythe International Court. It can be further safeguarded by the form of interim arrangement the U.K. has proposed. Those proposals are also designed toincrease the share of the catch available to the Icelandic industry, ensuring its future and providing a margin for development during the currency of theagreement.ANGLO/GERMAN COOPERATION21. Throughout the dispute there has been close consultation and co-operation with the Federal German Government. The latter are conductingproceedings before the International Court on similar lines to the proceedingsinstituted by H.M.G. The Federal Republic proposed on 15 September 1972that the negotiations with the Government of Iceland should be on a tri-partite basis. The United Kingdom accepted this proposal but it was rejected by the Government of Iceland. Consequently the British and German negotia-tions with Iceland had to continue on a bilateral basis but they have been closely coordinated. The composition of the two fishing fleets and the ares which they use are however different and this difference will no doubt be reflected in any eventual agreement.E.E.C.22. The Government of Iceland signed on 22 July 1972 an agreementregulating its relationship with the E.E.C.; this was ratified by Iceland in March1973. Because of the fisheries dispute Protocol 6 of the agreement which provides for reduction of tariffs on the import of certain fish and fishproducts into the Community has not yet been implemented. It will be forthe Community to declare when a satisfactory solution to the fisheries disputehas been achieved and, consequently, when to decide that the terms of the protocol should take effect.THE WAY AHEAD23. It is an essential element of British policy on international fisheryquestions that proper measures for the regulation of fisheries in areas outsideaccepted fisheries limits should be worked out by negotiation among all the
countries concerned and not imposed by unilateral action. Equally the BritishGovernment fully recognise that where such measures are found to benecessary an appropriate degree of preference should be shown to the coastalstate. This preference should not, however, extend to the complete exclusion of other countries traditionally fishing in the area. The British Governmentdeeply regret attempts such as that made by Iceland to pre-empt the 1974Law of the Sea Conference. Such attempts can only make it more difficultto reach international agreement at the Conference.24. The British Government have sought first to promote discussion ofthe conservation problem within the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commis-sion and then bilaterally with the Government of Iceland. They still considerthat it is by this means that an eventual solution must be found and, shouldthe Internationa! Court of Justice rule in favour of the United Kingdom, itwill be the Governments intention to initiate further discussions with theother Governments concerned either direct or through the N.E.A.F.C. Pendingthe Courts decision the British Government believe that the Interim Order ofthe Court provides proper measures to safeguard the interests of both parties.They are, however, still ready to pursue discussions with the Government of iceland on such further conservation measures as may be desirable and their detailed proposals of 4 May remain open.
DOCUMENTSDOCUMENT 1GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED KINGDOMS AIDE MEMOIREOF 17 JULY 1971The British Government have noted with concern that the policystatement issued by the Icelandic Government on 14 July 1971 states thatthe fisheries agreement with the United Kingdom &quot; shall be terminated anda resolution be made about an extension of the fishery limits up to 50nautical miles from the baselines, effective not later than 1 September 1972 &quot;.2. The British Government regret that a statement involving anagreement with the United Kingdom has been made by the icelandic government without prior consultation with or advance warning to the BritishGovernment. The Exchange of Notes on 11 March 1961 settling the fisheriesdispute between the Icelandic and British Governments provides that theBritish Government will be given six months&apos; notice of any extension of fisheries jurisdiction around Iceland and, in case of a dispute in relation tosuch extension, the matter shall, at the request of either party, be referredto the International Court of Justice. In the view of the British Government,that Exchange of Notes is not open to unilateral denunciation or termination.In the circumstances, the British Government fully reserve their rights underthe Exchange of Notes.3. The British Government also note that the policy statement envisagesthe establishment of &quot;a zone of jurisdiction of 100 nautical miles... for protection against pollution &quot;. The British Government cannot acceptthe right of any State unilaterally to assume jurisdiction over areas of thehigh seas and they therefore wish to reserve their position in this respect also.
DOCUMENT 2THE BRITISH CATCH LIMITATION OFFER AS PUT forward at THE TALKS BETWEEN BRITISH OFFICIALS AND ICELANDICMINISTERS IN REYKJAVIK ON 13 AND 14 JANUARY 1972The British Government took note of the Icelandic Governmentsstatement of 14 July 1971 that the 1961 Agreement between the twoGovernments would be terminated and a decision taken on the extension of fisheries jurisdiction to 50 miles effective not later than 1 September 1972.In an aide-memoire dated 17 July 1971 the British Government referred tothe provision in the 1961 Agreement for recourse to the International Courtof Justice, and reserved their rights under the Agreement. They also statedthat the Agreement was not open to unilateral denunciation or termination,and that they could not accept the right of any state unilaterally to assumejurisdiction over areas of the high seas. The Icelandic Government stated inreply, in an aide-memoire dated 31 August 1971, that the object and purposeof the provision in the 1961 Agreement for recourse to the international court of Justice had been fully achieved, and confirmed that they found it essential to extend the zone of exclusive fisheries jurisdiction around Iceland.The British Government replied on 27 September that such an extensionwould have no basis in international law, and repeated their formalreservation of all their rights under the 1961 Agreement including the rightto refer to the International Court.A first round of exploratory talks was then held between officials inLondon on 3 and 4 November 1971. At these talks, the British delegationstated their view that Iceland&apos;s objectives in preventing an incursion offoreign trawlers into the fishing grounds around Iceland, and in providingfor an expansion of the Icelandic fishing industry, could be achieved by acatch limitation agreement. A bilateral agreement of this kind would standa very good chance of subsequent multilateral approval, provided that it was an alternative, and not complementary, to extension of limits. The british delegation said that they would be prepared to elaborate their catch limitationproposals at a future meeting.The British delegation therefore wish to put forward the followingproposal. The basis on which it rests is that the Icelandic Government wouldnot proceed with their proposal for termination of the 1961 Agreement andunilateral extension of fisheries jurisdiction.At the 1968 meeting of the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission,the United Kingdom expressed, and has on various occasions subsequentlyreaffirmed, its readiness to take part in the negotiation of any arrangementsfor the limitation of catches in the Icelandic area that scientific evidencemight show to be necessary, and as a supporter of the Resolution on SpecialSituations Relating to Coastal Fisheries, which was adopted at the united nations Conference on the Law of the Sea on 26 April 1958 the UnitedKingdom accepts that such measures should recognise any preferential
requirements of the coastal state resulting from its dependence on the fisheriesconcerned.The most recent scientific evidence available to the Commission showsthat stocks of demersal fish in the Icelandic area are in a satisfactorycondition, and could indeed sustain more intensive exploitation. Nevertheless,having regard to the concern expressed by the Icelandic Government that an intensification of fishing by other countries might lead to a depletion of the stocks, and to the fact that the Commission is not yet empowered torecommend measures of catch restriction, the United Kingdom would beprepared as an interim measure pending the elaboration of a multilateralarrangement within the Commission to limit the total catch of such fishby United Kingdom vessels in Icelandic waters (ie in ICES Region Va) tothe average taken by such vessels during the ten years 1960-1969, ie 185,000tons. This would involve a reduction in the current level of United Kingdomcatches, which is estimated at 207,000 tons for 1971. It is understood that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany would be ready toagree to a similar arrangement.13 January 1972
DOCUMENT british SUMMARY OF MINISTERIAL TALKS HELD IN LONDON(24-25 MAY, 19-20 JUNE 1972) AND REYKJAVIK (11-12 JULY 1972)The first proposal made by the British delegation during this second phase of the negotiations was that the interim arrangement should be basedon the same principle of catch limitation as had been suggested in the firstphase, ie that the annual catch of British vessels should be restricted to185,000 metric tons. The Icelandic delegation countered with proposalswhose general effect would have been that only the smaller British vessels(less than 160 feet in length) would be permitted to fish and would be confined to certain areas between 25 and 50 miles from Icelandic baselines.The areas open to British vessels would vary from season to season under a six-sector arrangement but with no more than two sectors open at any onetime. This proposal, which would have involved a very serious reduction inthe British catch, and would in this and other respects have gravelyprejudiced the British case before the International Court, was totallyunacceptable to the British Government.In the belief that from the point of view of Icelandic Ministers the main difficulty of a simple catch limitation scheme was that there would be nophysical change in the pattern of fishing apparent on 1 September, the BritishGovernment proposed an effort limitation scheme, designed to achieve anaverage catch of 185,000 metric tons, based on the concept of an &quot; effectivefishing day&quot;. The Icelandic delegation, however, were not able to negotiate on the basis of this proposal.The Icelandic Government then put forward a slightly modified version of their first proposals under which the inner limit of the areas open toBritish fishing would be not the 25-mile line, but a line whose distancevaried between 14 and 27 miles from Icelandic baselines. They also indicatedreadiness to discuss changes in the upper size limit for British vessels, forwhich the figure of 160 feet had originally been proposed. The effect ofthese proposals would, on British estimates, have been a reduction in theBritish catch of about 80%, which was clearly unacceptable. The british delegation did, however, indicate their willingness to consider an arrangement of closed and open areas, similar to the six-sector proposal put forward byIceland but with the inner limit of the areas set at the existing 12-mile limit,provided that there were no other restrictions on British fishing and thatthe expected reduction in the British catch would be no greater than 20-25%.There was some preliminary discussion of this suggestion, and IcelandicMinisters said that they would in principle be satisfied with an arrangement which reduced the British catch by no more than 25%, ie to 156,000 metric tons. However, the Icelandic Government declared that they were not readyto explore the British suggestion in detail, and that they could no longerdelay the publication of the regulations enforcing the new 50-mile limitfrom 1 September.
DOCUMENT british SUMMARY OF OFFICIAL AND MINISTERIAL TALKSHELD IN REYKJAVIK(5-7 OCTOBER 1972 AND 27-28 NOVEMBER 1972)In this third phase of negotiations officials drew up for Ministersalternative proposals for patterns of area closures using six sectors, each ofwhich would be closed for a certain number of two-month periods. As the pattern of fishing varies widely from month to month, it is possible to achieve a given reduction in fishing opportunities by the closure of relatively few areas during those months in which fishing in them is heaviest, or byclosing a relatively large number of areas at times when fishing is least heavy.They took the bracket of 156,000 tons and 170,000 tons and for each endof it devised two patterns, one of a maximum and one of a minimum numberof closures. Of the patterns proposed two would have brought about, inan average year, the 25% reduction in the British catch with which at onestage in the previous phase of negotiations Icelandic Ministers had said thatthey would be satisfied. However when the results of this meeting were put to Icelandic Ministers, they decided that they could not continue discussions on the basis of any of the proposed patterns.At the Ministerial talks which followed at the end of November, the icelandic delegation were unable to accept British calculations as to the effect in terms of likely catch of the various patterns of area closure that had been proposed. They insisted on highly restrictive area closures (three out of sixareas at any one time) and the exclusion of all vessels above 180 feet in length.The British delegation countered by again proposing an effort limitationscheme. Icelandic Ministers said that they were not opposed in principle to an effort limitation scheme but that the one proposed by the British sidewas not acceptable to them and they had no alternative to put forward.The talks therefore ended without any progress having been made.
DOCUMENT british SUMMARY OF TALKS BETWEEN THE FOREIGN and commonwealth SECRETARY AND THE ICELANDIC FOREIGNMINISTER IN BRUSSELS (6 AND 8 DECEMBER 1972)Mr Agustsson, the Icelandic Foreign Minister, asked Sir Alec Douglas-Home to put forward a proposal coupling an effort limitation scheme withan area closure pattern. In his prepared statement, Mr Agustsson mentioned that &quot; we have talked about something like a 25% reduction &quot;. In subsequentconversation with Sir Alec Douglas-Home, he said that if the BritishGovernment accepted the principle of effort limitation the icelandic government could accept that only one area be closed at one time. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary put forward such a proposal, whichwas for a 10% effort limitation and a modified single area closure pattern,the whole to give a 25% catch reduction. He added that &quot;we would stillbe prepared to incorporate the proposed Icelandic non-discriminatoryconservation areas and ... on a seasonal basis, certain small areas wherethere are concentrations of fixed gear&quot;. (On 19 January the icelandic government rejected Sir Alec Douglas-Home&apos;s proposals. On 22 January theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary sent a message to the icelandic government urging further Ministerial talks for the negotiation of an interim arrangement on the basis of a 25% reduction of the 1971 British catch.The Icelandic Government never gave a clear reply to this proposal but on22 March there was a meeting of British officials and Icelandic ministers which paved the way for the Ministerial talks at Reykjavik of 3 and 4 May1973.)
ANNEX a document 6BASIS FOR THE MINISTERIAL TALKS ON 3 AND 4 MAY 1973(DOCUMENT PREPARED AT THE TALKS ON 22 MARCH and accepted BY MINISTERS OF BOTH COUNTRIES ON 3 MAY)POINTS OF agreement. The objective is to reach an interim arrangement. It would be hopedthat during the period of this arrangement the dispute about the legality of the Icelandic extension might be settled.2. The purposes of an interim arrangement would be:(a) to prevent overfishing of the grounds and at the same time permitIceland to increase her share of the available catch:(b) to permit maintenance of a reasonable British catch;(c) to avoid a recurrence of incidents on the fishing grounds.3. The arrangement would be based primarily on limitation of thetonnage of fish caught by British vessels in the area under dispute. Thereshould be no corresponding restriction on the tonnage caught by Icelandicvessels.4. The total effect of the arrangement should not be such as to frustrate the possibility of the British industry reaching the agreed catch limitation.5. The interim arrangement should not prejudice the position or therights of the Icelandic or British Governments in relation to the extensionof Icelandic fishing limits to 50 miles.6. Certain non-discriminatory conservation areas already defined shouldbe applied.POINTS FOR FURTHER consideration . If the interim arrangement ends before the dispute is settled, bothsides will need to consider the situation afresh. It is for consideration whatprovision should be made for this in the interim arrangement.2. Both sides recognise that the overall balance of the package of provisions would be as important as the detail of the constituent parts. Onthe individual elements for negotiations, Icelandic Ministers asked that thefollowing points should be considered:(a) The catch limitation figure should take account of the expecteddecline in stock abundance during the currency of the agreement.(b) They attach particular importance to the exclusion of all freezersand factory trawlers. They also wish to exclude some of the biggesttrawlers of other types and to ensure that the number of british vessels fishing in the area does not increase beyond whatever is agreed.
(c) They would like to include provisions for the closing on a rotationalbasis of one third of the disputed area at any one time and to excludeBritish trawlers from the additional areas already notified duringnegotiations as used by Icelandic small boats. It would be necessaryto consider the effect of such closures as part of the total package.(d) They consider that the interim arrangement should last for not morethan two years.(e) They want to ensure a measure of Icelandic control over the opera-tion of the agreement. It is necessary to consider the extent towhich this could be arranged without prejudice to the legal positionof either side.(0 They have asked whether in the event of an interim arrangementbeing agreed the British proceedings before the I.C.J. could be sus-pended.
DOCUMENT 7REPORT ON THE MINISTERIAL TALKS HELD IN REYKJAVIKON 3 AND 4 MAY 1973 AS MADE BY THE FOREIGN and commonwealth SECRETARY IN HIS STATEMENT TO THEHOUSE OF COMMONS ON 7 MAYBritish and Icelandic Ministers met in Reykjavik on 3 and 4 May.The meeting was based on talks held by officials on 22 March, duringwhich it had been agreed to work for an interim arrangement, withoutprejudice to the legal position of either side. This interim agreement would prevent overfishing, let Iceland increase her share of the catch, providefor a reasonable British catch, and avoid a recurrence of incidents. It wouldbe based primarily on a limitation of the tonnage of fish caught by british vessels, without a corresponding restriction on Icelandic vessels. The Icelandicdelegation asked for additional restrictions on the numbers and types ofvessels and the areas in which they would operate. It was agreed that these should be considered but that the total effect of the arrangement should notbe such as to prevent the British fleet from reaching the agreed catch figure.At the Ministerial talks this agreement was confirmed by both delegations.The British delegation recalled that the International Court of Justice in itsInterim Order of 17 August 1972 had indicated a catch limit of 170,000metric tons. In the interests of reaching a settlement, the delegation proposedan annual catch limit of 155,000 tons. The Icelandic delegation proposed117,000 tons. It was agreed to work within this range. The British delegationthen offered a revised figure of 145,000 tons representing an approximatemid-point between the Icelandic figure and that established by the Inter-national Court. The Icelandic delegation refused, however, to make anyfurther offer.The Icelandic proposals for restrictions on areas and vessels were also discussed. The British delegation put forward specific counter-proposals onall points. In the absence of agreement on the central question of tonnageit was impossible to settle these matters. But Icelandic Ministers have agreedto study the British proposals carefully.Despite constant and dangerous provocation, the British Governmenthave sought by every means to reduce tension. We shall continue to do so.If the Icelandic Government are determined to attempt to impose their willby force, the British Government will continue to give British vessels such support as may be necessary to enable them to fish in all areas up to thepresent Icelandic 12-mile limit. But if the Icelandic Government will enterinto real negotiations, they will find us ready to work for a settlement.
DOCUMENT 8ICELANDIC PROPOSALS FOR AN INTERIM ARRANGEMENT ASPUT FORWARD&apos; AT THE MINISTERIAL TALKS AT REYKJAVIKOF 3 AND 4 MAY 1973As explained at our previous meetings and clearly underlined now the icelandic delegation considers that a possible agreement will have to bebased on the following basic principles:1.  The agreement should not be valid for more than two years.2. Icelandic authorities must have the right and possibility to control the enforcement of the agreement.3. The agreement will have to guarantee considerable reduction in theBritish fishing effort in Icelandic waters and a considerable reductionin the total catch.In order to reach the goal set by the third point we consider the followingnecessary:A. The number of trawlers which are allowed to fish within the 50 milesshould be agreed to.Freezers and factory ships are excluded.Besides, 30 of the largest trawlers should be excluded based on thetotal number of trawlers fishing in 1971.B. The two conservation areas set by regulations dated 14 July 1972should be respected.C. The three fishing areas off the West, North and East coast reservedfor the small fishing vessels in accordance with our previous proposalsshall not be open to British trawlers.D. Two of the six areas in accordance with our previous proposal shouldbe closed to British trawlers on a rotation basis (see attached map).E. The total catch of British trawlers should not exceed 117,000 tons(ungutted weight) on an annual basis.Referring to the second basic principle, it has to be clear that in practiceIcelandic patrol vessels would be able to stop British trawlers and inspecttheir fishing gear and stop their fishing, if they violate the agreement.In our previous proposals we assumed:That three of the six fishing areas should be closed at one time on arotation basis; that the size of the trawlers should be limited to 180 feetor 800 tons; that no other vessels should be allowed to fish except those that had done so previously (for example during the last two years); and thatfreezers and factory ships would be excluded.We have changed our position in such a way that two fishing areas should* Orally at the beginning of the talks and in writing at the end,
be closed on a rotation basis and that the reduction in the number of shipsoperating in 1971 should be 30 of the largest trawlers in addition to thefreezers and factory ships. In addition, there should be a ceiling on the totalcatch, so that it will not exceed, on an annual basis, 117,000 tons.4 May 1973.

DOCUMENT 9BRITISH COUNTER-PROPOSALS FOR AN interim arrangement AS PUT FORWARD IN WRITING* AT THE ENDOF MINISTERIAL TALKS AT REYKJAVIK OF 3 AND 4 MAY 1973The British proposals are based upon the agreed statement reached atthe meeting of officials on 22 March and confirmed by Ministers on 3 May.2. According to this agreed statement, an interim arrangement shouldbe based primarily upon limitation of the tonnage of fish caught by british vessels in the area under dispute; and the total effect of the arrangement should not be such as to frustrate the possibility of the British industryreaching the agreed catch limitation.Catch Limit3. Against this background, the British delegation put forward thefollowing response to the specific further points raised by Icelandic Ministers.The primary issue is the catch limitation figure. The British delegation recall that British vessels are at present authorised, pursuant to the interim orderof the International Court of Justice, to catch 170,000 tons annually. TheBritish delegation have proposed a figure of 155,000 tons in the presentcontext. They could not contemplate a figure as low as 117,000 tons, butare prepared to seek agreement on a figure within a range running from117,000 tons to 155,000 tons. In an effort to reach agreement, they expressed their willingness to move to a figure approximately mid-way between theI.C.J. figure and the Icelandic figure, i.e. 145,000 tons.Area Closures4. The British delegation consider that, once agreement has been reached on a catch limitation figure, it should be possible to work out the remainingprovisions of the agreement in a way compatible with it. The precisearrangements would depend on the balance of area and vessel restrictions.The Icelandic delegation have explained that their proposals are intendedto be compatible with a figure of 117,000 tons. The British delegationrecognise the difficulty of making precise calculations of the effect of these measures. They consider, however, that a catch limitation of 145,000 tons would be compatible with rotating area closures on the following basis:Sept/Oct	B	DNov/Dec	D	BJan/Feb	A	FMar/Apr	F	CMay/Jun	C	EJul/Aug	E	A* Confirming British counter-proposals which had been made during the course of thesetalks.
It would not be possible to add significant small boat area closures withoutfrustrating this figure. The British delegation could envisage, as an alternative to the rotating closures, the following small boat area closures:(a) North-west area as proposed by Iceland but open to British vesselsfrom September to December.(b) North area as proposed by Iceland, but open in July and August.(c) Eastern area to be closed all year but reduced in size to run from thesouthern boundary north to Dalatangi.Vessel Restrictions5. If the Icelandic delegation are prepared to accept either of the abovesystems of area closures, or any combination of such measures which will produce the same effect, the British delegation will be prepared to seek theconcurrence of the British industry in a limitation of British vessels fishingin the disputed area to a total of 150 compared with the current total of 195.Under such an arrangement, no freezer trawlers would operate within the disputed area and about 20 non-freezer trawlers would be excluded. Factoryvessels are in any case not operated by the British industry.Duration6. The British delegation have proposed three years. As part of a generally satisfactory agreement, they would be prepared to compromiseat 21 years, to be embodied in the following formula:&quot; The agreement will run for a fixed term of 2-\ years, but the parties will reconsider the position before that term expires unless there hasin the meantime been a settlement of the substantive dispute. In theabsence of such a settlement, the termination of the agreement willnot affect the legal position of either party with respect to the substantive dispute.&quot;Control7. The British delegation are prepared to agree to Icelandic checkingand inspection of British vessels in the disputed area, but not to an Icelandicright of arrest or prosecution under Icelandic law. They would be prepared towork out in addition a further scheme of joint enforcement through anIcelandic-British Commission in order to ensure full compliance with theagreement.4 May 1973
CONSIDERATION OF CERTAIN ARGUMENTS EMPLOYED BY THEGOVERNMENT OF ICELAND DURING THE DISPUTE1. In the Exchange of Notes of 11 March 1961 the British and IcelandicGovernments agreed upon a 12-mile Icelandic fishery limit and that any subsequent dispute concerning the extension of Iceland&apos;s fisheries limitscould be referred to the International Court of Justice at the request of either party. The Icelandic Government however, although they have nowclaimed a 50-mile fisheries limit, maintain that the 1961 Agreement is nolonger in force and for that reason are not prepared to accept the jurisdiction of the Court. But the Court, having fully considered the arguments that the icelandic Government might have adduced, had they chosen to be repre-sented, decided on 2 February 1973, by 14 votes to 1, that it docs havejurisdiction in the present dispute. It is thus the view of the Court that the1961 Exchange of Notes is still valid. Iceland, as a member of the united nations is a party to the Statute of the International Court of Justice and istherefore bound to accept the Courts decisions as to whether it hasjurisdiction in a given case.2. The Icelandic Government claim that there has been a fundamental change of circumstances justifying their claim that the 1961 Exchange of notes has lapsed: but this is the view neither of the British Government norof the International Court of Justice nor am the Icelandic Governmentlegitimately argue that various resolutions passed in the General assembly and at sessions of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nationsconcerning &quot; permanent sovereignty over natural resources &quot; constitute any legal authority in support of Iceland&apos;s extension of fisheries limits. Suchresolutions are not themselves capable of amending international law as expressed in the current practice of states and as embodied in a numberof international treaties. Moreover the resolutions in question as a wholehad little or no bearing at all on the question of maritime jurisdiction.3. In defence of their fisheries policy, the Icelandic Government have saidthat Britain herself has unilaterally claimed a right to exploit the gas and oil resources of the North Sea. This is not true. The exploration and exploita-tion of seabed resources in the North Sea are regulated by international agreements negotiated and signed by the countries bordering on the north sea. These agreements stem in turn from the Geneva Convention of 1958on the Continental Shelf (which Iceland signed but did not ratify) andfrom the rules of customary international law laid down by the international court of Justice. Besides, international law makes a very clear distinctionbetween resources in the sea itself and those on or below the seabed. Itis expressly stated in Article 3 of the 1958 Geneva Convention, which reads:&quot;The rights of the coastal state over the continental shelf do not affectthe legal status of the superjacent waters as high seas . . .&quot; Moreover, the exploration and exploitation of the seabed by coastal states does not interferewith any rights previously being exercised by other states, whereas a similar
extension of fisheries jurisdiction by coastal states would extinguish rights which other countries have enjoyed and exercised, in some cases for cen-turies, in accordance with international law.4. Nor is it true to say that Britain extended her own fishery limits unilater-ally. In 1964 the United Kingdom signed the European Fisheries Convention,a multilateral agreement with a number of other European countries, cover-ing their North Sea, Channel and Atlantic coasts, and providing for a 12-milefishery limit.5. The Icelandic Government claim that in extending their fishery limitsthey are only doing what other states have already done. But no state in Europe except Iceland claims more than a 12 miles exclusive fisherylimit. Indeed, 12 miles is the maximum limit claimed by the greatmajority of states in the world and represents the universal pattern (un-brokcn except by Iceland) in European and North Atlantic waters. And inevery case where a state has formally claimed an exclusive fisheries jurisdic-tion in excess of 12 nautical miles, and this has been brought to their notice,the British Government have protested and have reserved their rights. Thereason that they have never before had to use the Royal Navy to protect british fishing vessels in such cases is that no country other than Icelandhas ever used force against them.6. The Icelandic Government claim that as the coastal state they are inthe best position to protect the fish stocks in the Icelandic area from over-fishing by foreign vessels and that they can do this by the extension oftheir fishery limits. Yet one of the worst recorded cases of overfishing citedby Iceland concerns the Atlanto-Scandian herring stocks, yields from whichrose above H million tons in 1966 and 1967 and dropped rapidly thereafter to the point where the fishery for adult herring has ceased to exist. the fishery took place in the coastal waters of Iceland and Norway very largely by the vessels of those two countries. During the period of heavy exploitationthe greater part of the catch was by Icelandic vessels and the component of the stock that spawns off the Icelandic coast was destroyed by Icelandicvessels alone. Regulations designed to increase the spawning stock havenow been imposed, but recovery in the foreseeable future does not seem likely. It is no doubt cases such as this that led the Food and agriculture organisation of the United Nations to conclude recently, in a study offish stocks* that &quot;there appears to be little relation between the successor otherwise of management actions and the type of jurisdiction withinwhich the resource lies. There arc . . . at least as many examples of depletedresources which were under the control of a single country ... as of thoseoccurring outside national jurisdiction.&quot;* &quot; Review of the status of some heavily exploited fish stocks&quot;.

NOTE ON CONSERVATION1. British fishermen catch only demersal, or &quot;bottom living&quot; species suchas cod, saithe, haddock and plaice in the Iceland area. They have not fished forthe pelagic species, mainly herring and capelin, which are or have been ofimportance to the Icelandic industry. About three-quarters of the British catchis of cod, and it is therefore in relation to the stock of this highly-prized species,and the effect of British fishing on the stock, that the conservation argumentshave in the main been considered by the two governments.The Icelandic Cod Fishery2. The Icelandic cod stock has been remarkable for its stability. Totalcatches for very many years have varied between 350,000 and 450,000 tons ofwhich Iceland catches rather more than half, the U.K. about a quarter pro-portions that have not greatly changed over the past 50 years.3. The stock supports two distinct fisheries. The &quot;spawning&quot; fishery inwhich the older cod are caught just before they spawn, is pursued entirely byIcelandic vessels and takes place almost wholly within the 12-mile fishery limit.Cod deteriorates rapidly in condition after spawning and disperses; &quot;spent&quot;cod are not caught in any quantity. Before they reach spawning age, the fishcan be fished further off shore, and this &quot;non-spawning&quot; fishery outside the fishing limits is mainly prosecuted by British and other foreign vessels thoughIcelandic vessels also participate in it. Although the fish taken in the non-spawning fishery are frequently referred to as immature cod, they areimmature only in the sense that they have not reached spawning age, andshould not be confused with young fish below the minimum size at whichthey are permitted to be landed by international regulations which areembodied in the Immature Set-Fish Orders. In the Iceland area cod reach a commercial size for human consumption at about three years of age;an investigation in 1970 showed that the average age of the fish caught byBritish vessels was 5.1 years as compared with 6.1 years for fish caught byIcelandic vessels.The Condition of the Stock4. The size of a stock at any time depends on the balance between the long-term effect of fishing and the supply (&quot;recruitment&quot;) of young cod. different levels of exploitation affect the age composition of the stock, but the main causeof changes in the size of catches is variations in recruitment. Within wide limits the level of recruitment does not depend on the number of fish spawning; it isenvironmental factors that determine the number of fish that survive to reach the age of recruitment out of the very large number of eggs that are produced.This is illustrated by the fact that although the Icelandic spawning stock afterthe war was much greater than in recent years, the number of young fishrecruited to the exploitable stock was no larger.5. If the spawning stock is progressively reduced, there must, of course,come a point at which recruitment is affected. Scientific opinion differs widely
as to the point at which that danger might arise. Many scientists consider thatthe Icelandic spawning stock could safely be reduced below its size in recentyears without detriment to recruitment, and this view is supported by the stability of the stock over a long period, and by the fact that the stock has been less heavily fished than other comparable stocks. A report made in 1972 to thetwo Fisheries Commissions for the North Atlantic by a group of scientists, theI.C.E.S./1.C.N.A.F. Working Group on Cod Stocks in the North Atlantic,showsthat for most stocks the catch in 1970 averaged 20-25% of the biomass, ie thetotal estimated weight of the stock. The comparable figure for the Icelandicstock is well below this at about 16%, whereas for the Arcto-Norwegian stockthe figure was as high as 41 %. While not accepting that any risk to recruitmentat present exists, the British Government nevertheless consider it prudent that a wide margin of safety should be allowed to safeguard against the developmentof such a risk. However, the limitations on catch imposed on the United King-dom by the International Court of Justice in its Order Indicating InterimMeasures of Protection, and on the Federal Republic of Germany in the casebrought by that country, are more than adequate for that purpose.6. Some misunderstanding has been caused by the recommendation of theI.C.E.S./I.C.N.A.F. Working Group that fishing effort on the cod stocks of theNorth Atlantic could desirablybe reduced by half. This has been cited as implying that catches of cod off Iceland should be halved, because the stocks were being over-exploited.TheI.C.E.S./I.C.N.A.F. working group reviewed the state of 12cod stocks in the North Atlantic. Some stocks such as the Southern Gulf of StLawrence Cod were relatively lightly fished and some increase in fishing ispossible. At the other end of the scale were stocks which were over-exploitedsuch as the North East Arctic cod. The Icelandic stock was in an intermediateposition and was described as being fully exploited. Over the North Atlantic as awhole the Group considered that the fishing effort on cod could be reduced byhalf without, in the long-term, reducing the catch of cod. At that reduced levelof fishing the abundance of fish in the stocks would increase, resulting in theeconomic benefits of increased catch-rates. In the case of the Icelandic stock,then, the reduction in effort was proposed for economic reasons but no reductionin catch was required. For stocks that were over-exploited however there wouldbe the additional benefit that the risk of recruitment failure would be reduced.7. The responsibility for conservation in the North-East Atlantic rests with the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (N.E.A.F.C.) which acts onthe basis of scientific advice provided by the International Council for the exploration of the Sea (I.C.E.S.). Reviews of the cod stocks, including the Ice-landic cod stocks, have been carried out at frequent intervals during recentyears five times between 1965 and 1972 and both British and Icelandicscientists have participated in the work. The United Kingdom Commissionershave repeatedly expressed their willingness to collaborate in any conservationmeasures over and above the existing N.E.A.F.C. regulations as to mesh of nets(the size of which was increased in 1966) and the minimum size at which fish are permitted to be landed which Iceland might propose, and which are supportedby scientific evidence. However, the only definite proposal made by Iceland (forthe closure of an area to trawling), besides being discriminatory in its effect, was found on scientific investigation to be of negligible value.
8. As fishing activity has intensified, it has been recognised that it willbecome increasingly necessary to supplement the conservation measures hither-to employed regulation of gear, closed areas, closed seasons, etc. by the direct limitation of catch or fishing effort. But as recorded in the White Paperitself, Iceland has recently refused to ratify an agreement adding catch and effort limitation to the list of measures which the N.E.A.F.C. is empowered to employ. In the words of a Resolution adopted by the Commission, this decision will &quot;have the regrettable and damaging result of depriving the Commission ofpowers which are indispensable to the effective performance of its responsi-bilities&quot;. In these circumstances, Iceland can hardly justify recourse to unilateral action when by her own act she has deprived the responsible international organisation of the powers which could protect her fisheries against any dangerof over-fishing that might develop in future; powers, moreover, which there is noreason to suppose that the Commission would be reluctant to use since themajority of its members are already parties to catch limitation schemes in theNorth-West Atlantic.9. However, even in the absence of further action by the Commission,scientific evidence does not support a pessimistic view of the current state of the icelandic cod stock. Although a risk of damage could at some point arise ifexploitation were allowed to increase, the stock is in fact effectively safeguarded by existing measures, and could have its long-term future secured if Iceland were willing to enter into the negotiation of a multilateral catch limitation agreement.printed in england for her majesty&apos;s stationery office by williams leaDdI43187 K.00 6/73
