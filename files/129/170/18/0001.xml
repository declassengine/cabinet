THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 7810 July 1973CABINETMAPLIN airport memorandum by the Lord President of the council. At the meeting of the Cabinet last week I was invited to arrange fora draft re-statement of the Governments policy in relation to the Maplinproject as a whole to be circulated for consideration.2. The attached draft could be adapted for use either as a majorspeech or as a document in some form.    My colleagues will wish toconsider whether it presents the case in the way we want;  and, if so, the timing and manner of publication.3.        On the latter the choice lies between:-a. A speech.b. A popular pamphlet (possibly with diagrams andillustrations).c. A Parliamentary publication, such as a White Paper,in which case a somewhat fuller presentation might be needed.d. Some combination of these media.In any event extensive follow-up publicity will be essential.4.        As to timing, a speech ilong the lines of the draft might be made on or before 23 July followed by a document later.    Alternatively we might aim to publish a document either simultaneously with, or preferably in advanceof, the publication on 23 July of the Consultation Documents on the New Townand the Road/Rail Corridor.    We need to consider whether there are anyprocedural or other objections to the publication of a document while theMaplin Bill is still before Parliament.J privy Council OfficeCOPY NO6510 July 1973
ANNEXjPHE CASE FOR MAPLINWHY WE NEED A THIRD LONDON AIRPORT1.     For years London has made do with two main international air-ports - Heathrow and Gatwick.     Now the time has come to build a third if we are to cope sensibly with the air traffic coming our way in the future.2.     Air travel is boomingAll over the world it is the fastest growing form of trans-port over the next 20 years.3.     Last year 27 million passengers used London&quot;s existing air-ports.     By 1985 it is expected to be - by any calculation - morethan three times as many:    Qk million passengers a year.k.     Bigger planes - fewer flights?All the signs are that most of the next generation of air-craft being discussed by the world&apos;s airlines will be no biggerthan the aircraft now in service.5.     Even so, taking everything into account, London&apos;s airportsbetween them are likely to be handling, well before 1Q85, one aircraft every minute of the day, every single day of the year,6.     One-a-minute, 24- hours a day.   Except that people won&apos;tlike taking off or landing in the middle of the night in 1985much more than they do now.    Nor would the people trying to sleepbelow tolerate it.   So for many hours of the day London1s air-ports can expect not one-a-minute but three flights every twominutes, or even two-a-minute.   And that is only within the next ten years or sos    it will increase after that.7.     Just think what that will mean,8.     SafetySafety must come first and foremost,     For the passengersin the air over London, safety means we cannot afford to have over-congested air corridors and over-loaded landing facilitiesbased on just Heathrow and Gatwick,/S.    And there
o.     And there must be safety for those on the ground too.Because, horrible as it may be to contemplate, the riskof accidents is obviously going to be greater   with so many more flights and three times as many passengers landingand talcing off.     This means making sure that in futureaircraft are; as far as possibles away from areas of highpopulation during this period of risk.10--   NoiseFor tens of thousands of homes around Heathrow and Gatwickthe   noise caused by aircraft is already regarded asintolerable.     In up to a million other homes this noise isjudged to be a serious nuisance.     And that is now - v/ithonly a fraction of the anticipated   traffic.11c    The lev! of noise- is bad enoughs though fortunately we can expect quieter engines to be developed.     But the frequency of noiso can be almost as bad; and only an engine that is virtually silent would make up for that by the time London&apos;sairports have to handle one-a-minute.12.    Passenger handlingAnyone who travels by air knows that all over the worldgetting off a plane and going through customs and immigrationis taking longer all the time.     V/ith three times as manypass ngers; London&apos;s handling facilities will have to be three times as good even to cope at the present; oftenunsatisfactory level.13.    That means more terminal buildings, more staff workingthere, and at the airport - and consequently more houses,shops,  schools and services to accommodate them and their families.     The areas around   London1s existing airportsare already crowded and th. re is little room for that kindof expansion14.    Of course, there is more to passenger handling than gettingthem on and off planes.     They have to be got to and fromthe airport.     Although there are good road and rail links between central London and Heathrow and Gatwick, they are-2- /often veryCONFIDENTIAL
often very crowded.     Already it can take longer to get from the airport than it does to fly from Paris orBrussels c15.    If it is bad enough now, what will it be like in 1985when we might expect 50 million passengers to be travellingbetween the airports and Inner London? Clearly the presentroad and rail links would not be adequate,16.    A new airport for London is the solution to the problemsposed   by tho great increase expected over the next tenyears to the end of the century.     The need for a third london airport has been accepted by successive governmentsof both political Parties.     It was confirmed after lengthyand thorough inquirj-j by the Roskill Report in 1969.17&quot;    In the intervening four years tne assumptions about London1sfuture air traffic on which the Roskill Report was bas dhave remained virtually unchallenged by any authority.WHY MAPLIN18.    The original proposal was to build   the third London air-port at Stansted.     The Roskill Commission rejected this,but the majority proposed, instead; another inland site^at Cublington.19.    The government  however, agreed with the minority   reportthat the new airport should be built on the coast at Maplin.It might be more costly in terms of cash, but this has tobe measures against improved safety factors and considerable-environmental advantages.20.    SafetyAn airport approach over water offers greater flexibilityfor take-off and landings with a consequent improvement ofthe safety factor for those on the ground.      It thereforemakes good sense to locate a new airport near sea or lake $as are many of the world&apos;s great airports today.     Maplinis about as near to London as such a suitable coastal sitecan be* /21.   Noise-3-
It is - estimated that 90 per cent of aircraft noiseassociated with take-off or landing at Maplin will be overthe s--a.     Even when a new town is built   nearby and air traffic noise reaches its peak in about 19S0 it is expectedthat very few homes will find noise a serious nuisance(as against up to a million at Heathrow and Gatwick eventoday) and that none v-ill find it intolerable.22*    EnvironmentToday Maplin Sands are in part covered by the sea at hightide:   the new airport will be built on land actuallyreclaimed from tho sea.     Instead of using up still morescarce land the Maplin project will in fact be adding tothe land resources of the nation.23.    Maplin is at present isolated, with comparatively few people living round about and only a missile range nearby.There are some birds and flora and fauna to whom regardwill be paid.     But the environmental damage of building an airport at Maplin is negligible compared with what itwould be at any suitable inland sitcc24.    OpportunityThe strategic plan for South-east England shows Maplinwithin the area designated for major growth.     Unlike mostof th;  region around London, which is already over-crowdedand has more than ample job opportunities, this is a partof Essex v/hich is still in need of development.25o   The high-speed road link necessary for the airport willalso serve to open up an area well-placed to meet the new opportunities for trade and industry in Europe.     Thereclaimed land could provide an excellent site for a majorseaport for the Port of London Authority.26.    It is intended that there should   be a New Town for thenew population that will come with the airport and thenew commercial opportunities that the Maplin project offers./WHY WE CAN AFFORD IT-4-
WHY VVE CAN AFPORD IT27.    Every major country in tho world is making preparations forthe expected expansion of air traffic.     Not to do so would be to show an irresponsible disregard for both airsafety and for future environmental considerations.28.    In Prance they arc already looking beyond the 1980&apos;s.They are just preparing to open the third Paris airportand are now thinking of a fourth.29^   Here in Britain any responsible government would have totake action now to increase the capacity of London&apos;sairports if they are to meet th^. increased demands expected of them by 19S0.20c Over the years, this will cost something like  430M (at1972 prices), irrespective of whether or not Maplin, or indeed any third London airport is built.31.    This accounts for more than half tho  82 5M the Maplinproject is expected to cost over the next 17 years.     Ofcourse, that is a lot of money.     But in less than a singleyear wc sp..nd that much on major roads alone, whereas thisis spread over 17 years at an average of  48M a year.52.    Of the remaining  400M or so which the project iseventually likely to cost,  140M is budgeted for thereclamation of 14.000 acres of land.     It would cost twoor three times as much to buy such lando     A new motorwayand rail-link arc likely to cost  160M, and if th;. portis built that might cost another  50M.33,-    These, of course, are all major developments in theirown right.     But in addition,, they will effect a saving on environmental damage around London and theHome Counties that is incalculable.34. There is no viable alternative and to pretend otherwise would be to deceive ourselves and, worse, to betray thefuture g nerations who would be the real victims of ourself-deception.5 /35*   The problems
35.    The problems of safety, noise and overcrowding are not going to disappear by patching up and overloading theexisting airports.     Passengers are not suddenly goingto prefer regional airports several hours from London, andthere are better ways of helping the development areasthan by building under-used road and rail links.Vertical take-off airliners are not suddenly going tocome into service;   if eventually they come into use,they will account for only a small proportion of totaltraffic.     The Channel Tunnel will divert only as muchtraffic as to give London&apos;s airports two or three years1breathing space.26.    Can we afford Maplin?   The answer must be Yes.     In fact,as a nation we cannot afford not to go ahead.37*    It is ejuite clear that a third London Airport is needed.We should, therefores go ahead with it as soon as practicableso that we can enjoy its benefits as soon as possible.The Government will be presenting to Parliament a reportmaking a detailed comparison of the various alternativeoptions.     This will be available before any large-scaleexpenditure is undertaken.WHY TOMORROW MATTERS TODAY38.    It is right that the detailed calculations of profit and loss should be examined.      But there is another consideration which should weigh with us.     It is whether any nation thatis c ither unable or unwilling to face up to its responsibilities to the future can long endure.39c    It is always easy to say No to tomorrows    that is thecheap way out.      It is always more difficult to say Yes:it will certainly demand some boldness even some sacrifice.40.   Yet each generation is judged, not merely for what it can do for its If but for whe,t it can do for the next and thenext after that.     A nation is judged not only for what itis now but how it faces the future./41.   And that-6-CONFIDENTIAL
And that demands self-confidence and resolve.     confidence in our national characters   resolution to meet today th^needs of tomorrow.
