[THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(73) 63 COPY NO      gj:21 May 1973CABINETWHITE PAPER ON&quot;BETTER HOMES - THE NEXT PRIORITIES&quot;Memorandum by tne Secretary of State for the environment.        At its meeting on 18 May the Home and Social Affairs committee invited me to submit for the Cabinefs approval the White Paper, of whicha draft is attached, which sets out the Governments proposals for the next stage of its drive to rid the country of bad housing.    This draft takes account of various suggestions made by the Committee.2.        A vigorous programme of improvement to older housing is a keyelement within our total housing strategy.    A great deal has alreadybeen achieved.    Improvement grants are being taken up in recordnumbers - nearly 320, 000 approvals in 1972 - and it is important to sustainan effective effort oa this front if we are to show proof of our determination to deal with the nation^ excessive legacy of sub-standard housing in good time.3. My Department has completed a review of current policy on olderhousing, a review which subsequently became a PAR.    House irnprove-ment has been boosted by the higher grants in Development and intermediate areas which expire in June 1974.    The review has shownthat we can now accept a reduction in the overall total of grant aidedimprovement - in future we must concentrate our energies and resourcesmore emphatically on dealing with these places where the work conditionspersist - the areas of housing stress and deprivation which scar too manyof our major towns and cities.    We must also answer the criticisms onspeculation and misuse of grants which are losing us some of the creditthat our achievements merit.4.        I propose therefore -i.       to introduce the new concept of Housing Action Areaswithin which a wide range of special powers and extra financial help will be concentrated in a concerted attack on the worsthousing conditions;1
ii.       to give more encouragement to general improvementareas and to make the improvement grant scructure more flexible;iii.       to make the system of grants more selective and to checkspeculation by stopping full grants for the more expensiveowner-occupied properties, and all grants for second homes,and by allowing local authorities to attach conditions to grants to landlords.5. These proposals were foreshadowed by statements in Cmnd 5280,&quot;Widening the Choice - The Next Steps in Housing&quot;.    We need to publishthis complementary White Paper as soon as possible to allow time for consultation with local authorities and others, and to prepare legislation for the next session, before the summer is too far advanced.6.        I invite colleagues to endorse the proposals set out in the draft white Paper and to agree that, subject to drafting amendments, it may go forward for publication early in Tune.G r department of the Environment21 May 19732
&apos; confidential)v._--yDRAFT WHITE PAPER : BETTER HOMES - THE NEXT PRIORITIESI :   INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY1.     In its White Paper, &quot;Widening the Choice; The Next Steps in housing&quot; ^&quot;Cmnd. 5280^7 the Government proposed a range of new measuresto keep up the momentum towards home ownership and to expand the role of housing associations in providing rented accommodation, especiallyin areas of housing stress.   This White Paper complements those proposals.   It proposes a range of measures to tackle, as a prioritytask, the housing situation as a wholo in those areas where conditionsin human and physical terms are worst.   It also proposes additional measures to ensure ths more effective improvement of both houses and their immediate environment in general improvement areas.   Finally it proposeschanges in the improvement grants system to give more help towards meetingthe needs of those people who find it more difficult, than others to providethemselves with a decent place to live.2.     For too long, too many people in this country have had to live inunfit or inadequate housing, despite vigorous policies which have begun to counter the legacy of past neglect in the physical condition of ourolder housing.   In 19&amp;7 when the first National House Condition Survey wasmade, there wore 1.8 million slums in England and Wales; by the end ofthis year &quot;the figure will be under 1 million.   In 1967 nearly 4 milliondwellings lacked basic amenities - running hot water, a bath or decentindoor sanitation; by the end of 1973 the figure will be down to 2^million.confidential
(confidential)Nearly 70j000 unfit houses and flats are cleared as slums each yearand in 1972 319jOOO grants for house improvement wore approved comparedwith 157jOOO in 1970*     Between 1969* the year in which the last majorAct dealing with housing standards came into force, and the end of 1973at least lt&apos;lCO,000 older dwellings - equivalent to about 8 per cent ofthe current housing stock in England and Wales - should have been eithercleared or improved with the help of a grant.3*     This progress, while encouraging, provides no ground for complacency.Much remains to be done.    Almost one household in six still lives ina house that is unfit or lacks at least one of the basic amenities.     the worst physical conditions are increasingly concentrated in our citiesand older industrial towns in parts of which there is intolerableovercrowding and multiple occupation.     The decline of the privaterented sector is adding to the hardship of many people living in thesestress areas.     In some conditions are getting worse, not hotter.We must not only maintain the drive to improve the physical conditionof our housing.     V/e must do so in ways that will give most help tothose people in greatest need and make the best contribution towardssolving the many social problems inextricably linked with bad housing.k-.     The Government fully recognises that Wales has certain special problems, and believe that these, together with those which have been identified in England, will be effectively dealt with by the proposed measures.
II : THE REVIEW AND ITS conclusions.The Government&apos;s proposals follow their wide-ranging review ofpolicy on slums and older housing.   As part of this, the second inthe series of National House Condition Surveys, conducted in 19?ljprovided up-to-date information on the condition of the housing stockin England and Wales and comparisons with the results of the initial1967 survey.   Other material included a report of an Official working party with representatives from London&apos;s inner boroughs; and thepreliminary results from the Government1s examination of the socialimplications of the use of improvement grants in the stress areas ofLondon.   Valuable information carae from local authorities in theirreplies to DOE, circular 50/72 and Welsh Office Circular 110/72 whichinvited them to survey their older housing, to indicate the strategiesthey proposed to adoot for dealing with it and to suggest any changesin procedures to overcome constraints on effective action.   Carefulaccount has also been taken of the findings of the Panel of Inquiryon the Greater London Development Plan.6.      The Government is following closely the proceedings of the environment and Home Office Sub-Committeo of the Expenditure Committeeof the House of Commons which is enquiring into the improvement grant
(confidential)s_----ysystem.   They will study the forthcoming report of the Sub-Committeemost carefully before reaching final decisions.7*       The Government has, however, felt it right to announce at theearliest possible date the main conclusions it has reached to allow   &apos;time for consultation with local authorities and others before bringing forward detailed legislative proposals.(confidential)h
fJ?he Condition of the Housing Stock8.   The Annex to this Y.rhite Paper summarises the salientfacts and figures on the condition of the housing stockand the recent progress on slum clearance o,nd improvement.9. The 1971 National House Condition Survey showed thatthe total number of sub-standard dwellings in England andWales (that is, dwellings which are either unfit or lackingat least one of the basic amenities) was then 3.1 million.The incidence of bad housing was not, however, constantthroughout the country,   It is estimated that over 10 percent of the total housing stock in the North of Englandwas unfit in 1971 compared with 4 per cent in the SouthEngland lacked at least one of the basic amenities comparedwith under 14 per cent in the South East.10. ijy\xe survey also indicated that some tjnoes of ownerfound it more difficult than others to keep their houses in decent condition.   Only 4 per cent of owner-occupiedhouses were unfit as against 23 per cent of privately-rented houses.   Similarly about 42 per cent of privately-rented dwellings - many of which were the sole letting of individual landlords - needed more than  250 worth of repairs as compared with under 13 per cent of owner-occupied houses,   The survey indicated that the type ofhou.se which, for a variety of reasons, it was difficultto maintain at a reasonable standard was most likely to befound in the privately-tenanted or low income owner-occupied sector of an urban or conurbation area;   to haveCONl? BIEHTI ATi 5
COITPTIETHUIALbeen built before 1919 and to have a new rateable valueof under  200.Rennits of Existing Policies11*  Since 1967 the average rate of slum clearance has been about 70,000 houses a year.   In addition some 110,000 unfitdwellings each year have been restored to fitness, oftenwith the aid of an improvement grant,   The slum clearancesubsidy introduced by the Housing Finance Act 1972 willenable those local   authorities with large numbers of unfithouses to press ahead with their clearance programmes,The Government will continue to encourage local authoritiesto accelerate clearance where redevelopment is the bestanswer, and to press ahead with the comixLementary task of promoting the improvement of those unfit dwellings whichcan be transformed into good homes,12, The Housing Act 1971 which, until 23 June 1974, provideshigher rates of improvement grant in the development and intermediate areas has achieved its purpose of giving ashort, sharp boost to the improvement of -housing in these areas, and has made a dramatic contribution towards reducingthe regional imbalances.    In 1972   58 per cent of all grantswent to the assisted area,s, the vast majority for houses in the North of England,13. The Government&apos;s review indicated that improvementpolicies were generally helping in the right way. Forinstance, estimates derived from the house condition surveyCOMFIIWHTIAT, 2
sample show that, between 19^7 and 1971, grants in England and Waleswere distributed as follows:-a. 70 per cent for dwellings built before 1919?b. 60 per cent for terraced housing;C 73 par cent for properties in urban or conurbation areas;d. 89 per cent of all standard grants and 83 psr cent of alldiscretionary grants for dwellings with a new gros3 rateable value of under  200 (or  80 prior to revaluation).14.   Tho latest assessments by local authorities indicate that, withrare exceptions, they expect to deal with all their existing slums by1982.   To aid them in this ta3k, however, the Government has reviewedths procedures for slum clearance.   After consulting local authorities,the Government proposes to introduce legislative measures to simplify theseprocedures so as to reduce the time that they take.   But in addition to maintaining the slum clearance programme at broadly its current level itis essential that the drive on improving the remaining poor houses bedirected to where the need is greatest so as to ensure that, by the earliestpossible date, nobody should have to live in a substandard house.   the key to sucoess lies in the development of complementary strategies forunfit and older houses and in gatting priorities right.Planned Renewal15.   The Government believes that, in the majority of cases, it is nolonger preferable to attempt to solve the problems arising from badhousing by schemes of widespread, comprehensive redevelopment.   Suchan approach often involves massive and unacceptable disruption ofcommunities and leaves vast area of our cities standing derelict anddevastated for far too long.   Regardless of the financial compensation
they receive, many people still suffer distress when their homes arecoapul3orily acquired; increasing local opposition to redevelopment proposals is largely attributable to people&apos;s understandable preference for the familiar and, in many ways, more convenient environment in which theyhave lived for years,   Large-scale redevelopment frequently diminishesrather than widens the choice available to people in terms of the 3tyleof houses, their form of tenure, and their price.16.   Some local authorities, recognising the heavy financial and socialcosts involved in major redevelopment schemes have begun to draw upprogrammes in which new building and rehabilitation are carefullyintegrated, house improvement being used to phase urban renewal inways which allow continuous, flexible and gradual redevelopment on a relatively small scale.   The Government v/ishes to encourage thi3to be cleared and redeveloped quickly; somo to be given minor improve-ment and repairs pending clearance in the medium term; others comprisingpredominantly tha sounder houses to be substantially rehabilitated andpossibly included in general improvement areas.   This approach alsomeans that fewer homes, at any point in time during the process ofrenewal, are lost from the stcck of available dwellings - a very important consideration in areas of housing scarcity.
(CONFlPENflAT)Redirection of Priorities17.   The Government will continue to give its full support to all local authorities actively promoting house improvement.     But they believe that it is now right to redirect the priorities and emphasisof improvement policy to ensure that help is given more positively tothose areas v/here the worst housing problems are increasinglyconcentrated and to those improvements which will produce the mostworthwhile results, in particular;(a) To those areas where very many houses are in a bad conditionbut where nevertheless there is a heavy demand for accommodation.The combination of these factors, most typically found in thecentral areas of our cities, especially in London, creates acutehousing stress characterised by multiple-occupation, over-crowdingand. in extreme cases, homelessness.     Improvement of the physicalcondition of housing is essential in these areas but in some, suchas parts of Inner London, where there is evidence that poorerresidents are being increasingly squeezed into a declining amountof cheaper rented accommodation, a sensitive application ofimprovement policies is needed to avoid hardship and the abuse of grants.(b) To other areas of housing deprivation characterised by especiallypoor physical and environmental conditions but where population maybe falling and the pressure of demand low - typically the centralparts of many older industrial towns and cities and areas ofindustrial dereliction.     The owners of houses in such districtsmay be unable to meet their share of the cost of improvement, or unwilling to invest in the future of an area in decline.     Major
programmes of renewal may not be justified in most of these areasbut it is important to maintain an acceptable quality of housingfor the people in them.     This problem arises particularly inthose areas in Wales which are not subject to the same kind of concentrated housing stress characteristics of the worst areasin England but are nevertheless, for social and economic reasons,in need of special treatment to maintain them as living communities.(c)   To general improvement areas which should be residentialdistricts free of stress conditions and containing sound, olderhousing, capable, through improvement, of providing decent homesin an enhanced environment for at least another 3a years.   . Inthese districts improvement ought to produce the best results by providing a better quality of living for established communities and giving the best value for money.     General improvement areas have so far failed to raise the standards of our older residentialdistricts to the extent that the Government considers bothdesirable and possible.(d)   To essential repairs.     The lack of help towards repairswithin the scope of the standard grant has led to a good deal ofneglect, mainly because poorer owners are unable to meet the full cost of such work.
III.      THE NEXT STEPS18.       The Government will introduce early legislation toredirect priorities in dealing with older housing.Consultations will begin immediately with local authoritiesand others on the measures to be included in that legislation.   The remaining paragraphs of this White Paperoutline the main features - of the Government&apos;s proposals.HOUSING ACTION AREAS19.      To give priority to the task of dealing comprehensive^with the physical conditions in the remaining areas of worsthousing and to help those people suffering hardship arisingfrom these conditions, the Government proposes to providefor the declaration, by local authorities, of Housing ActionAreas.   Within these areas.:-(a) Local authorities will be expected to develop and carry through comprehensive action programmesusing both the full range of their existing powersand special new powers which will be applicable only within these areas;(b) extra assistance will be given towards theimprovement of all types of housing in ways whichwill protect and help existing residents;(c) housing associations will be encouraged tomake a major contribution to helping with both
housing and social problems by acquiring existing renteddwellings, providing new rented accommodation and undertakingmajor programmes of rehabilitation.20,    The Government will consult local authorities on the basis onwhich Housing Action Areas will be selected.     They envisage theestablishment of a series of broad criteria, some combination - butnot necessarily all - of which would need to be met before an areajustified declaration.     The criteria might cover both social and housing factors, including:-a density of occupation exceeding 1.5 persons per room;the percentage of furnished tenancies;the amount of shared accommodation;the numbers of elderly people and large families;the numbers of houses lacking a hot water supply^a fixed bath, or an inside W.C.These indicators of stress are not intended to be exhaustive, nor willall of them need to be equally satisfied in each Housing Action Area.The Government recognises that housing stress can manifest itself invarious ways in different parts of England and V/ales and proposes tomake the procedures determining the declaration of Housing Action Areassufficiently flexible to enable areas suffering from different formsof housing stress to qualify.     The criteria, which will be reviewedregularly, will, moreover, be used essentially as a guide, to thedeclaration of Housing Action Areas not an absolute test.
(confidential)21.   Before declaring a Housing Action Area the local authority would need to be satisfied thst the area justified special treatment, thatit satisfied the broad criteria for Housing Action Areas and that its proposals took account of the authority&apos;s general planning proposals.It would need to be sure that its action programme for dealing with theproblems of tha area was consistent with the resources it could make available to carry out that programme efficiently and in good time.Although there would be no predetermined limits to the size of housing action Areas the Government would expect them to be of manageabledimensions so as to ensure that satisfactory results could be obtainedreasonably quickly.    Typically an area might include four or five hundred dwellings.    Larger local authorities could, of course, tacklea bigger area or a number of smaller areas together.     The government proposes that the declaration of a Housing Action Area should run for if local circumstances, justified this.     Normally, however, theGovernment would expect that substantial progress towards alleviatinghousing stress and improving physical conditions should be made withinthe specified tiraescale.22.   Declaration of Housing Action Areas would not require prior approval by the appropriate Secretary of State.     The Government propose however that local authorities should inform him of the declaration of these areas, provide evidence that safficient of the specified criteria were satisfied, and indicate the action programme proposed in each.     provision would also be made for the views of the residents and owners on the actionprogramme to be conveyed to the Secretary of State.     If he was not satisfied that a declaration was justified or that an action programme was both adequate and realistic he would have powers to dancel that declaration. .
(confidential)23.   This approach will call for a concentrated management effort bylocal authorities to deal with the problems of stress areas;   theGovernment does not underestimate the difficulties that will be involved, nor the length of time it may take to tackle the very worstareas of our cities.     That however, makes it all the more urgent to begin.     The Government, therefore, proposes that certain new powersand additional financial help should be made available within housing action Areas.     But the Government believes that a great deal can beachieved by full use by local authorities of the very wide range oftheir existing powers, such as those for deadling with multi-occupation and with harassment and the illegal eviction of tenants.     They arealso prepared to look sympathetically on the use of existing compulsory purchase powers under Part V of the Housing Act, 1957 where no other action will succeed in renewing pockets of inadequate dwellings withinHousing Action Areas.2k,   The Government is concerned to ensure that action taken in housing action Areas is in the interests of residents.     The Government hopes*  that existing landlords will co-operate in the programme of comprehensiveimprovement but some landlords may prefer to dispose of their tenantedproperty and in some cases it may be desirable for the management orownership of tenanted property to pass into new hands.    The Governmentwill look to housing associations increasingly to acquire and manageproperty in Housing Action Areas and so preserve a wide range of choice of rented accommodation.     The Housing Corporation, together with theNational Building Agency, will be ready to help housing associations toenable them to carry out this key social role, by supporting them bothfinancially and with technical advice.    The Government looks to localauthorities to work closely with housing associations amd make full .use of their expertise and enthusiasm in attacking the problems caused_(confidential)_in
(confidential)by the decline of the private rented sector.25. The Government is very concerned that in some areas especially in parts of London there is simultaneously a severe housing shortage andexcellent use of short-life property to house families in desperatehousing need.     The Government welcomes this approach and will continueto encourage local authorities to make the fullest possible use of dwellings that might otherwise lie empty.     local authorities canensure that this is done for houses of all kinds that they themselvesown as a matter of sound management.     The Government is reviewing theirown arrangements to make sure that other houses in public ownership, for short or long periods, are made available wherever this could help tomeet housing needs.     Where private owners are keeping dwellings in housing Action Areas needlessly empty and it is clear to local authorities that this situation is unlikely to be remedied, the making of compulsory purchase orders should be considered:   such orders would be given themost careful consideration.     The need also to keep a close watch uponempty houses outside Housing Action Areas should not be overlooked bylocal authorities since the accommodation these properties offer couldalleviate over-crowding within the stress areas.     The Government^reforms of local authority finance will include a proposal to.make thepower to rate empty properties more flexible and enable authorities to charge up to 100$ rates on them instead of the present 50%.     Thiswill serve as a further discouragement to keeping homes empty.26.   Local authorities should also aim at providing enough one ortwo bedroom dwellings to enable them, in areas of housing scarcity, to cope more readily with the problems associated with the under-occupationof older houses.a significant number of empty dwellings.lany local authorities make
(confidential)27.   In addition to the intensive use of existing housing measures,the Government proposes that, within Housing Action Areas, localauthorities should have a range of special additional powers.     the precise extent of these powers is a matter which the Government will &apos;settle after consulting the local authorities and other bodies, andafter studying the forthcoming report of the Environment and Home OfficeSub-Committee of the Expenditure Committee of the House of Commons.Subject to this consultation, however, the Government proposes thefollowing measures within Housing Action Areas:-(a) to empower local authorities at their discretion, and withincertain limitations insofar as owner-occupiers are concerned, to compel minimum standards of improvement and repair in cases where,after reasonable opportunity, the owner showed no sign of improvinghis property voluntarily;   and to empower loczl authorities to carryout such work in default;(b) to give local authorities a discretionary power to attachconditions to the payment of improvement grants to landlords toensure that improved rented accommodation was kept available forletting at registered rents for a period of up to seven years.If the property was sold within that period, an appropriate proportionof the grant, plus compound interest would be repayable to thelocal authority;(c) to empower local authorities to require landlords sellingtenanted property within the area to offer first refusal of thesale of the property to an approved housing association;or, if this is ighown to be impracticable, to the local authorityitself. _
confidential)(d)   to empower local authorities to nominate a tenant for vacantrented accommodation in circumstances where it could be demonstrated that the landlord was making an inadequate effort to fill thevoid;(e)   to place local authorities under a statutory duty to rehouseany tenant temporarily or permanently displaced from accommodationwhether such displacement arose from redevelbpment or rehabilitation of existing properties;(f) to provide a preferential rate of improvement grant as a counter-part to the introduction of new compulsory powers.     Incases of hardship, local authorities would be given discretion to award grants above this preferential rate.    For work up tothe standard adopted for compulsory improvement, a grant would beavailable to owners as of right.(g) to introduce special repairs-only grantsAdequate rights of appeal for individual owners or residents would beprovided in relation to the exercise of these new powers by localauthorities.     For example, the position of tenants in dwellings subjectto a compulsory improvement notice would be appropriately safeguarded.28.   In introducing these proposals for Housing Action ^reas, theGovernment is fully conscious of the need to view the task of urbanrenewal as a whole and the wisdom of developing policies which enablethe complex, inter-related problems of inner cities to be tackledcomprehensively.    For esample, policies directed toward maintaining an improved stock of private rented accommodation in our major industrialcities are also- in the interests of policies aimed at increasing the
(confidential)mobility of labour.     The Government has itself mounted studies intothe possibility of achieving a total approach to the treatment of such areas in three cities - London, Liverpool and Birmingham.     Theproposals now brought forward for Housing Action Areas will be designedto be sufficiently flexible to allow adjustments to be made in the future to match any new approaches found to be required as a result of these and other studies.
(^CUNrlubN IIAL)GENERAL IMPROVEMENT AREAS29*     The Government intends to give greater priority to the develop-ment of general improvement areas to enable them to make more impact on the quality of the environment of older residential districts inthose very many parts of England and Wales free from housing stress.For this purpose a rate of improvement grant   higher than thatgenerally available - although not as high as that obtaining in housing Action Areas - will be introduced.   Repairs-only grants willalso be made available within general improvement areas.30.     The Government expects local authorities, when deciding whichdistricts should be selected as general improvement areas, to take into account not only the physical condition of the housing stock,which should generally be fundamentally sound and capable of providinggood living conditions over many years, but any planning proposals affecting the area, its social stability, and the economic benefits of proceeding by way of rehabilitation rather than by redevelopment.Districts suffering from a high degree of over-crowding, multiple-occupation and other forms of housing stress should not be selected for general improvement area treatment - such areas should be considered for Housing Action Area declaration.   On the other hand, in districts.
iconfidenttat)where owners are likely to take the initiative by improving their property, the additional incentives and benefits of a general improve-ment area are not necessary.   In order to ensure that the proposedpreferential grant does not lead to indiscriminate declarations ofgeneral improvement areas, the Government will take powers to rescindthe declaration of such areas.   These powers will apply to general improvement areas declared after the date of this White Paper.31.     There should continue to be full consultation between the localauthority, owners and residents to foster the necessary goodwill and voluntary re-operation required for the successful development ofgeneral improvement areas.   The Government proposes, however, that infuture there should be provision for objections received from residentswithin proposed general improvement areas to be forwarded to the    *Secretary of State, so as to guide him when considering whether thedeclaration should be confirmed.32.     The Government accepts that the present level of exchequer contribution towards the cost of environmental work undertaken bylocal authorities may be inadequate in a small number of cases wherespecial treatment is justified.   It proposes,therefore, to give the secretaries of State power, in exceptional cases, to approve some
(^confidential;addition to the normal statutory limit of  200 per house on whichthe Government1s contribution is based.33.     The Government accepts the argument which has been advanced by many local authorities, especially those in London, that they need greater power to secure a necessary minimum level of improvementwithin general improvement areas.   It proposes, therefore, that localauthorities should be given discretion to require the improvement oftenanted dwellings within general improvement areas to a tolerablestandard if, after reasonable effort, they should fail to securenecessary improvements by voluntary action on the part of landlords.
GENERAL APPLICATION OP EIPROVEIIENT GRANTS SCHEME34   In addition to the special proposals in respect of housing Action Areas and General Improvement Areas,the Government proposes a number of changes affectingthe general application of improvement grant policythroughout the country.Grants and Repairs35. The Government accepts that many low-income house-ovmers have difficulty in financing adequate repairs to their properties.   This problem is most acute inrelation to the existing standard grant which aids theprovision of &quot;basic amenities &quot;but does not meet thecost of any associated repairs.   Moreover many ownerswhen given the larger discretionary gro^t?3- -      whiov?up to half can at present cover repairs - have sought to maximise the extent of improvements to theirproperties while neglecting essential repairs.   Thisis clearly short sighted.   As part of adjustments&apos;tothe detailed structure of grants the government proposes:-a.   to improve the help given by means of theexisting standard grant by introducing a newintermediate grant which will not only cover a specified proportion of the cost of installingbasic amenities, as at present, but will also meet a percentage of the cost of repairs necessitated by those improvements or considered by the localauthority to be essential to prevent the propertydeteriorating into unfitness.   This more generous
grant will &quot;be available to owners as of right,including - unlike the present system - those with property within general improvement areas,b.   to specify that, unless in the opinion oflocal authorities this condition can be waived,a substantial proportion of the full discretionarygrant should relate to repair items.In Housing Action Areas and general improvement areasgrants for repairs only will be payable at the discretion of local authorities who would be asked to limit their availability to low income owners.CONFIDENTIAL
( confide nt!al7grant Levels36.   The Government does not consider that it isnecessary, in general, to take immediate action toraise the maximum amount of grants.   In the first quarter of 1973 only 20$ of all improvement grantswere at or within  100 of the existing ceilings.The high current level of grant approvals clearlyindicates that the existing grants provide asufficient inducement to houseowners.   The Governmentwill, hov/ever, continue to watch the situation very   *closely and will be ready to consider increasing thegrant ceiling should it become apparent that this isnecessary.Grants to Housing Associations37.   The Government however, believes that additionalhelp towards the acquisition and improvement orconversion of older dwellings undertaken by housing associations is necessary to enable them to make agreater contribution towards solving the problems of(confidentIal)
older housing, especially in areas of acute shortage.The Government has, therefore, increased the levelof allowable cost ceilings for housing associationsacting under arrangements with local authorities under section 121 of the Housing Act 1957.38.   The Government is reviewing, with the housing corporation and housing associations, the longer termcontribution they can make and the additional measures that may be needed to enable them to fill the enlarged role foreseen in this White Paper andin Cmnd 5280.Grant Conditions and Means Testing39.   Although there are clear indications that in areas of acute housing shortage especially inner london, some owners have sought to make unjustifiablyhigh profits by abusing the improvement grant system,such abuses have not been widespread.   The Governmentsees no reason why a local authority should make agrant in circumstances v/here it is reasonable to expect that the scheme of improvement would have been undertaken without a grant because of its inherentprofitability;   or where the improvement would not,in the local authority&apos;s opinion contribute towards meeting the housing needs of their district.
(confidential)40.   Local authorities have, however, stronglyrepresented to the Government that it would enablethem to maintain a more effective control over thedistribution of grants and v/ould discourageirresponsible actions by a minority of owners if theywere to be given discretionary power to attachconditions to grants.   The Government accepts thatsome additional control of this kind is justified.It also believes that there are many ov/ners living in houses with the basic amenities whose financial circumstances are such that they ought to be ablefurther to improve their homes, if they wish, withouthelp from public funds.The Government, therefore, proposea.   to prohibit the payment of   grantabove intermediate standard to ownerswhose household occupies exclusively adwelling with a new rateable value above 200 generally in England and Wales or above  400 in Greater London;   and
b.   to give local authorities a dis cretionarypower to attach conditions to the payment of grants to owners other than owner-occupiers.The conditions would ensure that for a periodof up to three years following the grant-aidedimprovement, the dwelling concerned should remain available for letting at a registeredrent.   If the dwelling were to be sold during that period an appropriate proportion of thegrant, v/ith compound interest, would have tobe repaid to the local authority.   This power would be applicable to tenanted propertyoutside Housing Action Areas within which special conditions will apply.41.   In addition the Government proposes toproscribe the payment of any form of grant tov/ardsthe cost of improving a second home.IV.   CONCLUSION42.
