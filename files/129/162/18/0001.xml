HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT63CP(72) 43 COPY NO20 April 1972CABINETTHE 1972 REVIEW OF SOCDAL SECURITY BENEFIT ANDASSOCIATED CHANGES: DRAFT WHITE paper note by the Secretary of State for Social Service a1, I am circulating for the information of the Cabinet the text of theWhite Paper which, subject to final drafting changes. I propose to publishwith the forthcoming National Insurance Uprating Bill.2. The White Paper details the proposed higher rates of social security benefits and contributions, and gives a factual account of theother changes which were outlined in my statement to the House on22 March.    It will be accompanied by the usual Report by the government actuary on the Financial Provisions of the Bill.3. The main increases of benefits and contributions were authorised by the Cabinet in its endorsement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;budget proposals (CM(72) 17th Conclusions).    The changes in the minorrates were consequential and broadly proportionate and were settled withthe Treasury.    The proposal to extend the scope of the attendance allowance and the minor improvements to the war pension, national insurance and supplementary benefit schemes were approved by theHome and Social Affairs Committee on 13 March.    The extension ofthe earnings band attracting earnings related supplement to the short-term benefits in consequence of the upper limit of the ceiling of earningson which graduated contributions are paid was cleared in correspondence with members of the Committee.K department of Health and Social Security20 April 1972
REVISED draft the 1972 REVIEW OF SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS AND ASSOCIATED CHANGESPART IINTRODUCTION1,       la Dooamber 1971 the Governmeat announced that henceforth the rate of retirement pension and related benefits would be reviewed annually.   Theannouncement indicated that for operational reasons in the Department ofHealth and Social Security and in the Inland Revenue the annual benefit increases could normally take effect in the second half of November, butthat for 1972 the increases would be in October - mid-way between the 1971and 1973 up ratings,2,      A Bill is being introduced today to give effect to the proposed increases in national insurance and industrial injuries benefits.   Parallel improvements in war pensions and supplementary benefits will be provided under appropriateinstruments.   The increase in benefit and the increases in contributionsrequired to finance them will take effect from the week beginning 2 October.3.      The Bill also proposes an extension of the scope of the attendance allowance.   This new benefit for the most severely disabled, which first becamepayable in December 1971 * is now paid to those who - in broad terms - need a greatdeal of attention or supervision by day and by night.   From the start it was recognised that this was no more than a first step and the Government now proposeto extend the scope of the allowance, by stages, to those whoe need for attentionarises either by day or by night.
3 national INSURANCE benefits the benefit increasesA.     The standard weekly rates of flat-rate retirement, widows1 and invaliditypensions, and of flat-rate unemployment and sickness benefit will be increased from  6 to  6.75 for a single person and from  9.70 to  10.90 for a married couple.   Dependency increases for children vary according to the type of benefit and the amount of any family allowances payable.   The rate paid with unemployment and sickness benefit is at present  1.85 for the eldest child with lower ratesfor other children so as to bring the total for each child, including family allowances, up to that amount.   This rate will go up to  2.10.   The children of widows and of invalidity and retirement pensioners attract a specially high rate, at present  2.95 (including family allowances where these are payable); thiswill go up to  3.30.   The weekly rate of guardian&apos;s allowance and child&apos;s specialallowance will also be raised from  2.95 to  3.30.5.    The weekly rate of old person1 s pension payable under the provisions of the1970 and 1971 National Insurance Acts will be increased from  3.60 to  A..05.   for married women, the present  2.20 will be increased to  2.50.6,    The weekly rates of widow&apos;s basic pension and contributory old age pension payable to certain widows under the former Contributory Pensions Acts are tobe increased from  1.80 to  2.03.7.    The ratefrof invalidity allowance will go up from ^0p960p and  1 to ;35p*7Qp and  1*15 respectively^Table of rates8.    Details of the existing and proposed new rates of retirement pension andother national insurance benefits are given i^Appendix X,  Correspondingimprovements will be made in pensions and benefits payable at less than thestandard rates.Earnings-related supplement[9.    The upper limit of weekly earnings on which earnings-related supplement is paid will be extended to  48 in line with the new upper limit for graduated
contributions (see paragraph 28).   This supplement is paid with flat-rate benefitduring the first 6 months of unemployment, sickness or widowhood.   The new limitwill take effect in the assessment of supplements based on earnings in the1973/74 income tax year.   This is the first full year in which contributions willhave been paid up to the new earnings level of  48. ]Unemployment and sickness benefits10.   It is proposed - as a further help to the working wives of the chronicsiok - to make a change in the rates of unemployment and sickness benefit payable to them if they pay full contributions.   The wives of invalidity and retirement pensioners or of men receiving an unemployability supplement will be paid benefitat the standard rate ( 6.75 a week) instead of at the lower married women1s rate( 4.75).11.   The level of earnings allowed from a subsidiary occupation before title to unemployment benefit is affected will be raised from 33?P a day to 75p a day.The  2 a week limit on earnings from therapeutic employment whilst receivingsickness and injury benefit will also be raised to  4.50 a week.   Thecorresponding earnings limits applying to the war pensions and industrial injuriesuneraployability supplements will similarly be increased.Attendance allowance12.   The National Insurance (Old persons1 and widows&apos; pensions and attendance allowance) Act 1970 received Royal Assent in July 1970.   It introduced the attendance allowance as a new benefit for the most severely disabled, and the allowance was put into payment from December 1971.   So far well over 80,000 awardshave been made and claims are still coming in.   The 1970 Act provides, broadly speaking for the allowance to be paid to those who are in need of a great deal ofor supervisionattention/both by day and by night.   The G-overnment have always recognised thatthese stringent conditions exclude many severely disabled people and that theprovision was no more than a first step.13.  The Bill now being presented in addition to increasing the present allowance to  5.40, will extend the scope of the allowance to bring in broadly those whoseor supervisionneed for attention/arises either by day or by night. For them the allowance willbe at two-thirds of the day and night rate - that is  3.60 a week. The allowance is tax-free.
14*    Very large numbers will be involved in this extension.   As many as halfa million people may claim, and 250,000 may qualify.   The administrativeresources needed, particularly in terms of medical manpower, will be formidable,Moreover, although the process of take-on for the present allowance was startedas long ago as June 1971 * claims are still coming in and there are many reviewapplications outstanding.   Both have to be dealt with at the same time as workstarts on the preparations for the extension, v It is therefore inevitable thatthe extension must be phased.   After taking the advice of the Attendance AllowanoeBoard, the Government propose to take first those of working age, then children and then the elderly in two stages.   The first group to be taken on will thereforebe -those born between 1 January 1908 add 31 December 1956 inclusive.   It isproposed to take claims from this group from the beginning of December this yearand to start making payments to them from 4 June 1973*   Claims from children and thetwo groups of the old will be taken and their allowances put in payment in threesuccessive stages in the eighteen months between June 1973 and December 1974*Children will be defined as those born on or after 1 January 1957*   The two groups of the elderly will be, first, those born between 1 January 1898 and 31 December1907 and secondly, the older group, those born on or before 31 December 1897*15* Supplementary benefit claimants and their dependants who qualify for thenew allowance will get the full benefit of it except for a very small minoritywho are already getting a special addition for the cost of personal attendance.
INDUSTRIAL INJURIES1b. The current weekly rates of injury benefit will be increased from  8.75to for a single person and from  12.45 to  13.65 for a married couple.The pension for an assessment of 100 per cent disablement will be increased from  10 to  11.20 with proportionate increases in the rates for lowerassessments.   The maximum gratuity (for assessments below 20 per cent) willbe raised from  660 to  740.   The rates of all the allowances paid withdisablement benefit will also be increased.   The pension for widows, which is atpresent  6.55 is to be raised to  7.30.   Further details of the industrial injuries benefits are given in Appendix II.
PART IVWAR   PENSIONSDisablement pensioners1.7.   The 100 per cent rate of disablement pension, now  10 a week excludingrank additions, will be increased to  11.20 with proportionate increases forlower assessments, and officers1 rates will be similarly increased.Unemployability supplement, all 5 rates of constant attendance allowance,and exceptionally severe disablement allowance will also be raised, as will the age allowances payable at 65 to those pensioners whose disability is assessed at 40 per cent or more.18.   There will be 3 other changes which will help pensioners withunemployability supplement.   Invalidity allowances paid with the supplementwill go up by the same amount as those paid with invalidity pension underthe national insurance scheme.   The earnings rule, which is expressed in annual terms, will be raised from  104 to  234. /Qnd the working wife of aman receiving unemployability supplement, who pays the full national insurance contributions, will be paid benefit when she is sick or unemployed at thestandard rate instead of the lower married women&apos;s rate.War widows19.   The standard rate of w*r pension for the widow of a private soldier,, atpresent  7.80 a week, will be increased to .S8.80 a week.   Pensions for widows of non-commissioned, warrant and commissioned officers will be similarlyincreased.20. Two further changes affecting some war widows will also be introduced.One will be the abolition of the 30p qualifying rent for payment of widows&apos;rent allowance.   At present a war widow with one or more dependent children7
qualifies for an allowance of the amount (up to a maximum of  3 a week) bywhich her rent and rate3 exceed 30p.   In future she will qualify for an allowance to cover the total rent and rates she pays up to a maximum of 3.40.   The second change covers the award of a war pension to the widowwhose husband died more than 7 years after the termination of service but who was not in receipt of a war pension at any time during his life.   Underthe existing legislation if the widow of such a main claims a pension on theground that his death was   caused or hastended by war disability but her claim is rejected, she has no right of appeal.   The Warrant is to be amended toprovide such widows with appeal rights.Hospital in-patienta21.    Powers will be taken to enable the Secretary of State to adjust thebenefits of certain hospital in-patients.   War pensioners with unemployabilitysupplement (which is a substitute for sickness benefit) will have the supplementadjusted in the same way as those receiving sickness benefit but treatmentallowance will be paid in full.   War widow in-patients with no national insurance benefits will have their pension adjusted after 52 weeks in hospital.Table of rate322.    Details of the change in the main rates of war pensions and allowances are given in Appendix III.   In common with the community at large war pensioners will of course be entitled to the improvements in any social security benefits which they may be receiving.8
SUPPLEMENTARY benefits the scale rates2J     The Government also propose to raise supplementary benefits.   The changes will be made by regulations, a draft of which will be laid before both houses of Parliament for approval.   For the two main categories, the single house-holder and the married couple, the level of requirements will be increasedto  6.55 and  10.65 respectively.   These increases, of 75P and  1.20,are the same as those now proposed in the standard rates ofnational insurance benefits.   The rates for young people and children willbe increased proportionately.The long-term addition^4.     The long-term addition - at present 50p (or 75p where the claimant ora dependant is aged 80 or over)-is to be increased by 10p to 60p (or 85p).   Thxsaddition is intended to provide a margin for miscellaneous special needs andfurther special additions are only applicable where the long-term addition is insufficient to Meet all of a claimants special needs.   Consequently, under thepresent rules, the increase in the long-term addition would not benefit thosewho also receive a special addition, since the addition would be correspondingly reduced.   With the approval of the Supplementary Benefits,Commission, it isproposed to alter this by providing that on this occasion the amount oi theincrease in the long-term addition (1 Op) will not be taken into account in deciding the amount of the addition for special needs.   This means that all those now receiving the long-term addition will get an increase or at least a further10p in their total income, giving an overall increase (with the improved scalerates) or 85p for a single householder and  1 .50 for a married couple.Special additions&apos;3&apos;    The Supplementary Benefits Commission have decided to increase some of the additions for special needs which are paid at fixed rates.   Thoiie for extraheating will go up from 25p, 50p and 75p to 30p, 60p and 90p respectively.Those for special diet3 will go up from 35p to 40p (lower rate) and from 77p to92p (higher rate).   Because the increase in the long-term addition is beingignored in deciding the amount of a special needs addition, these improvementswill result, in many cases where people need special additionsjin a further in-crease in total income.
Older aaolescentsi.-j5.     Two additional changes are proposed for older adolescents.   Those aged18 to 20 who are non-householders will become entitled to the rate nowappropriate to claimants aged 21 or over, which will be  5.20.   those aged16 to 17 will, for the first time, receive the non-householder rent allowance,which is being increased to 70p.Table of rates27.     Details or the supplementary benefit increases are given in Appendix IV ,10
CONTRIBUTION CHANG-ES28.      The Government propose on this occasion to ;aeet the cost of the improvements in the benefits payable from the National Insurance Funds mainly by increasingthe grauuated contributions paid on earnings of more than  18 a week, and the flat-rate contributions paid by employers.   The increase in graduated contributionsis a further move towards the Government objective of a fully earnings relatedcontribution for employed persons foreshadowed in the white Paper &quot;Strategy for pensions&quot;    .   This long term plan also envisages that employers will pay ahigher graduated contribution ihan employees, but under present arrangements itis not practicable for employers and employees to pay different rates of graduated contributions.   The increase in the employees share of the ilat-rate contribution is a move towards placing a higher proportion of the total contribution on employers.Graduated contributions29.      The graduated contributions paid by employees and employers on earnings between  18 and  42    a week will be increased from 4.35 per cent to 4.75 percent and contributions of 4.75 per cent will also become payable on earnings between  42 and  48   a week.   The additional graduated contributions will earncorresponding graduated pension rights.   There will be no increase in the graduated contributions payable on earnings of  18   a week or less.Flat-rate contributions30.      The flat-rate contributions paid by employers will be increased by 10p aweek for a man, 9p for a woman and 8p lor those under age 18.   The employee1 s share of flat-rate contributions will not be increased.   The earnings thresholdat v.hich contributions normally become payable will be raised from  5 to  6.   Thiswill make it unnecessary to continue the provision by which an employee earningweeklyat a/rate of less than  6 pays a lower proportion of the total contribution and his employer a correspondingly higher proportion.31.      The self-employed arid nnn-employed do not pay graduated contributions.Their flat-rate contribution will therefore be increased so that they pay ashare of the co..t of the improved benefits.   Self-employed men will pay an extra18p a week and women an extra 15p.   For the non-employed the increases will be 13p,men, and 10p, women.   The earnings level at which self-employed persons1contributions normally become payable will be raised from  4 to  5. a week_* Cmnd 4755.11
Industrial injuries contributions32.     The cost of industrial injuries benefits is met by flat-rate industrial injuries contributions which are usually payable as part of the combined national insurance contributions.   Of the increase in the employees share of the flat-rate contributions for men 1p is for industrial injuries purposes the new contribution rates33.     Examples of the proposed increases in contributions for employed menand women (Class 1) including those contacted out are given in Appendix v table A.   Table B of that Appendix gives details of the proposed new mainweekly rates of flat-rate contributions for employed persons and their employers, and of the new flat-rate contributions for the self employed(Class 2) and non-employed (Class 3)12
PART VIIICOSTS34.      The cost of all the proposed changes will be about  480 million in1973/74*   380 million - including  273 Billion for retirement pensions -will be paid out of the National Insurance Fund, and  15 million out of theIndustrial Injuries Fund.   The remaining cost will be met from the consolidate fund;  52 milliea for up rating and improving supplementary benefits,  15million additional expenditure on war pensions,  3 million for uprating oldpersons&apos; pensions and  3 million for uprating attendance allowance.   Thecost of extending the scope of attendance allowance will be  11 million,eventually rising to about  45 million a year when all the age groups underthe extension have been taken on.   The Exchequer contribution to the national insurance Funds will also be increased so as to maintain the total exchequer support to the national insurance schemes at about 18 per oent of contribution income.13restricted
