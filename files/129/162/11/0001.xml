PART I.   GENERALThe present situation. This year&apos;s Annual Review will be the last to be held before the Treaty of accession to the European Economic Community comes into effect. producer and market prices in this country will begin to rise in 1973 towards those ofthe Community a process which will be completed by 1978. The changesinvolved in our system of support will be considerable. So too will be thebenefits to United Kingdom agriculture as a whole, especially if the presentrising production trends continue. The effect of entry into the e.c. has been one of the main considerations that the Government have taken into accountduring the course of,the Review and in making&apos;the subsequent determinations.Condition of the industry. Partly due to favourable weather, 1971/72 has been a good year for UnitedKingdom agriculture. Output has risen again. Productivity continues toimprove. There has been a further increase of  57 million in aggregate net income. The increase in net costs has not been on the exceptional scale of lastyear. Even so these costs have risen in aggregate since the last Review by 56Jr million for all products and for produce to which the guaranteed pricesapply and therefore coming within the provisions of the Agriculture Act1957-by  48 million.The needs of agriculture in the EEC3. When the common agricultural policy of the e.c. applies in full to UnitedKingdom agriculture, farmers can expect markedly higher prices for most of theagricultural commodities they produce. Some items of expenditure, notablyfeed costs, will also rise but the general prospects are clearly good. It is in thenational interest that United Kingdom agriculture should be in a position totake advantage of the opportunities. The essential thing is to ensure thatexpansion of production takes place early, and not merely after the advantages to be had under the e.c. system have begun to make themselves felt. our share of the enlarged e.c. market including our own home market will depend on the competitiveness of our farmers. This means that we should aim to improve the already good record of productivity gain in our agricultural industry from the start of transition by stimulating the investment which is needed for expansion and by securing the advantages of increased scale.Aim of the government. The Government^ aim is to encourage producers to start taking decisionsfor further expansion now. This is particularly important in the livestocksector. There is inevitably a time lag between the decision to expand thebreeding potential of the flock or herd and the achievement of increased outputof meat or milk.  The time lag is longest for cattle.  Moreover, it is the
Government^ belief that the greatest gains in overall efficiency in United King-dom farming are likely to come, in e.c. conditions, from farming systems basedon a balanced combination of livestock and arable production. The decisionsmust, of course, rest with individual farmers, particularly since physical andclimatic conditions vary greatly between farms in different regions.5. These are the general considerations which the Government have had inmind in making the determinations after this Review. They have decided toput the chief emphasis on the livestock sector and particularly on cattle. Asubstantial incentive has been given for the early expansion of the dairy herd.More milk will enable us to produce in this country more of the butter, cheeseand other dairy products we need; more calves will make it possible to increase our output of beef. At the same time, the Government have given furtherdirect encouragement to beef production, whether based on the beef breedingherd or the dairy herd, by increasing the end price. Although cattle have beengiven first priority, substantial encouragement has also been given to sheep andpigs which are important elements in the livestock sector as a whole.6. The agricultural industry will need increased resources and an improvedcash flow if it is to step up the rate of expansion. These can be obtained partly from the recent increase in farm income and partly from rising productivity.But something more is needed if results are to be obtained quickly. TheGovernment propose to provide additional resources by more than recoupingcost increases as a whole and by providing considerably more than recoupmentfor some commodities in line with the broad pattern of priorities. This means that a substantial cash injection will be available to the industry to accelerate the present rising trend of production.7. The Government&apos;s view is that the provision of these extra resources is best made through the guarantees on end prices. The determinations havebeen framed accordingly; they include the switching of about 60 per cent ofthe fertiliser subsidy to end prices, a change which will allow farmers greater flexibility in the use of resources. But within this flexibility, the effective use of fertilisers on both crops and grass will remain a vital means of securing optimumyields and thus the greatest possible benefit from the substantial increases inend prices.Future of the Annual Review. 8. Although this will be the last Annual Review before the UnitedKingdom accedes to the e.c., it will not be the end of the system of annual reviews of the general economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry. Moreover, determinations will continue to be made followingAnnual Reviews for at least some years longer for products for which there isno Community r6gime and for other guaranteed products within the terms ofArticle 54 of the Act annexed to the Treaty of Accession. Nonetheless, thedirection of future Reviews will increasingly be towards the state of the agricultural industry in the Community as a whole and the price determinations made in brussels. This is bound to require changes in the Review procedures and it isproposed to discuss these with the Farmers&apos; Unions and the other interests affected during the course of this year.
The measures taken9. On crops the determinations are as follows:Wheat the guaranteed price will be  1-72 per cwt., an increase of 9p;Barley the guaranteed price will be  1-56 per cwt., an increase of lip;Oats the guaranteed price will be  1 -51 per cwt., an increase of 7p;Rye the guaranteed price will be unchanged at  1 -08 per cwt.;Potatoes the guaranteed price will be unchanged at  16-55 per ton;Sugar beet the guaranteed price will be  8-00 per ton, an increase of 40p.10. These determinations will provide full recoupment of cost increases oncereals crops after taking account of the reduction of the fertiliser subsidy.The increased costs on sugar beet will be substantially recouped. No changehas been made for potatoes, where there is a prospect of continuing surplus.11. It is particularly important and in everyone&apos;s interest to maintain the stability of the UK cereals markets throughout the 1972/73 season by the normal and regular release of home-produced grain. We can thus be assured of an orderly and smooth progress towards the adoption of the e.c. system on 1stFebruary 1973. The Government therefore intend to keep a careful watchfor any developments which might adversely affect orderly marketing and stability.12. The upward trend in potato yields is now so marked that despite highExchequer expenditure on support buying it has still been necessary to makedeficiency payments. To some extent this is being rectified by reductions in the target acreage. High yields may also have been obtained, however, without full regard to the requirements of the market. The Government therefore welcome the recent decision of the Potato Marketing Board to limit the size of potatoesmarketed for human consumption and so encourage production of the type ofpotato that is preferred by the market. The Government propose during thecoming year to carry out a full examination of the guarantee and marketing arrangements for potatoes during which all parts of the industry will be consulted as appropriate. Meanwhile they are introducing arrangements for makingsupplies from the 1972 crop available for potato granule manufacture at specialprices, so as to retain this outlet for the home crop.13. The arrangements for sugar beet have to take into account the need togive effect to the agreements reached on sugar during the e.c. negotiations andalso the fact that an enquiry is currently being conducted into the UK sugarrefining industry. In the light of all the circumstances it has been decidedthat the guarantee should continue to apply in 1973 to the whole crop from theexisting acreage (443,000 acres). Consideration will be given to the methods and arrangements by which sugar beet growers might best avail themselves of opportunities in the enlarged e.c. to expand their acreage significantly after1974.v 14. The determinations for the livestock sector are as follows:Fat cattle-the guaranteed price will be  13-20 per cwt., an increase of 85p;Fat sheep the guaranteed price will be 24-3p per lb., an increase of 2p;)
Wool the guaranteed price will be 23-0p per lb., an increase of 0-3p;Fat pigs the guaranteed price will be  2-81 per score, an increase of 5p after taking account of the automatic adjustment on account of feed costchanges; the middle band of the flexible guarantee (i.e. the number of pigs to whichprice adjustments are geared) will be 14-35-15-0 million certifications,an increase on the level set after the 1971 Annual Review (13-35-14-75million certifications) and on the revised level set in August 1971 (14-0-15-0 million certifications);Milk the guaranteed price will be 23 ip per gallon, an increase of lp per gallon; the standard quantities will remain at the revised levels set in July 1971except that the standard quantity for Northern Ireland will be increasedby 14-8 million gallons to 120 million gallons;Hen eggs the guaranteed price will be 16-0p per dozen, a reduction of 0-5p;Duck eggs the guaranteed price will remain unchanged at 15-5p per dozen.15. Cost changes on all products in the livestock sector have been more thanfully recouped after taking into account the reduction of the fertiliser subsidy.The pool price for milk will increase substantially as a result of the increase inthe guarantee and higher returns for milk outside the standard quantity ifmanufacturing milk prices remain at or near their present levels. For pigs thehigher level and narrower width of the middle band should enable the flexibleguarantee to play its part in regulating output by providing for incentives whenproduction is in danger of falling too low and deterrents when it is rising toorapidly. The Government will review the level of the middle band later in theyear if circumstances make this appropriate. On eggs, the Government are continuing their policy of moving towards a free market. A further step willbe taken this year towards phasing out deficiency payments. Eggs will beremoved from the guarantees in 1974.16. Since the policy on milk both in the United Kingdom and in the EECis concerned with the production and price of all milk, including milk for manufacture, the idea of a standard quantity based on sales of liquid milk is becoming increasingly unrealistic. Discussions have been held with the Farmers&apos;Unions in the light of the undertaking given at the 1971 Annual Review (Cmnd.4623, paragraph 16) and it has been agreed that the standard quantity shouldcontinue simply as part of the conventional Review framework for the purposesof accounting. With one exception, therefore, the standard quantities for individual milk marketing areas will be the same for 1972/73 as for 1971/72.The exception is Northern Ireland. The pool price there is below that in therest of the United Kingdom and it will be brought more nearly into line withthat in Great Britain by increasing the standard quantity for the Northern Irelandmilk marketing area and by raising the guaranteed price to the level of that for england and Wales.17. The Government recognise that there is widespread dissatisfaction amongfarmers with the terms of the compulsory eradication scheme for brucellosis.The Agricultural Departments are already undertaking urgent enquiries which
will provide detailed information about heavily infected herds. In the light ofthis review it is intended to examine the scheme further in consultation with the farmers&apos; Unions and to consider whether and, if so, in what ways it should be changed.18. Subject to Parliamentary approval, the  20 million by which the fertilisersubsidy is to be reduced will be replaced by higher end prices and, in the case ofhill farming and horticulture, by increases in the winter keep subsidy andhorticulture improvement grants respectively (although horticulture improvement grants are not formally included in the Review determinations).19. A special two-year increase in the rates of the main farm capital grantswas introduced following the 1970 Annual Review and ends this year. the items eligible for assistance under the Farm Capital Grant Scheme have been-examined. It is proposed that, subject to Parliamentary approval, grants for fencing, for hedge removal, scrub clearance, land reclamation and ploughingand for certain other minor items will be discontinued except in hill areas, butthat grants for field drainage will continue to be available at the enhanced ratesof the last two years (70 per cent on hill land and 60 per cent in other areas).20. The cost of the guarantees for milk and sugar beet is borne by the consumerbut there will not be any consequential increases in consumer prices during thecoming year. The cost of the other measures taken falls to be met from public funds. They involve an Exchequer commitment for 1972/73 of some  49million in addition to the provision in the Estimates.Marketing21. The Government recognise the particular importance that efficientmarketing will have after accession to the European Economic Community andare engaged in a close study of the current situation in the e.c. and the steps that will need to be taken to ensure the optimum development in this field. Onesignificant aspect is co-operative marketing; producers are already responding to the need to develop co-operation and this will be even more important infuture. The Government therefore propose to invite the Farmers&apos; Unions, theCentral Council for Agricultural and Horticultural Co-operation and other appropriate organisations to consider how voluntary co-operation for marketingpurposes may be further encouraged and how producer marketing organisationsmay be best developed. The conclusions of the Committee of Inquiry onContract Farming and the result of current proposals for a British agricultural marketing development organisation will be relevant to such consideration.
PART n. ECONOMIC CONDITION AND PROSPECTS OF THEAGRICULTURAL INDUSTRYOutput (Table 13)22. The index of net product is forecast at 116 for 1971/72, compared with 111for 1970/71 (average of 1964/65-1966/67 ^ 100). This is a rise of about 4  percent. Outputs of cereals, sugar beet and poultry meat are expected to increasesignificantly and quantities of purchased feedingstuffs to fall. favourable weather has contributed both to the increase in output and to the reduction infeed purchases.Labour productivity (Tables 13 and 14)23. Over the period 1964/65 to 1971/72 there has been an average annual rateof increase in labour productivity of about 6 per cent. The outflow of regularwhole-time workers is estimated to be currently running at about 3 per centannually. This compares with an average rate of outflow of about 5 per cent from 1967 to 1970 and a rate of 6-7 per cent in the early 1960s.Income (Tables 12, 13 and 16)24. The aggregate net income of the industry has to provide the reward to farmers and their wives for their labour and management and also the return ontenant-type investment. In 1970/71 aggregate net income was  611 million, 44 million (8 per cent) more than in 1969/70. The increase was greater thanthat expected at the time of the 1971 Annual Review. A further increase of  57million (9 per cent) to  668 million is forecast for 1971/72. This year the weather has been particularly favourable for farming and if the income figures are adjusted on the assumption that the weather was normal they become  612million in 1970/71 and  630 million in 1971/72, an increase of  18 million (3 percent). Actual aggregate net income in real terms in 1971/72 is forecast to rise byabout 3 per cent on 1970/71. When account is taken of the falling number and growing size of full-time farms, the increase is of course greater.25. The latest information from the sample farm accounts is for 1970/71. InEngland and Wales as a whole average net income for all types of farm (exclud-ing horticulture) rose by about 16 per cent between 1969/70 and 1970/71.Dairy, cattle, sheep and cereals farms benefited most as a result of higherguaranteed and market prices and an excellent wheat harvest. There were sub-stantial increases in incomes in all regions except in southern and eastern Englandwhich were affected by poor barley crops and lower potato returns. In Scotlandaverage net income rose by 23 per cent because of appreciable increases on live-stock farms. In Northern Ireland the increase in average net income of 8 percent was less than in most other parts of the United Kingdom.26. In 1971/72 dairy and livestock farms are expected to do well throughoutthe United Kingdom. Higher returns for milk, cattle and sheep (particularlystores) are likely to raise the value of output and feed bills may be lower. Crop-ping farms in England and Wales should also do better this year though farmswith substantial barley or potato acreages will probably not do so well as those where wheat or sugar beet predominate. Cropping farms in Scotland areexpected to have lower incomes.
Investment (Table 15)27. Total gross capital formation in agriculture is estimated at about  387million in 1971. This comprises new buildings and works, plant, machinery and vehicles, and stocks (mainly growing crops and cultivations and livestock).Of this investment  135 million was in buildings and works. This is over 20per cent more than in 1970 and represents a substantial increase in the volume of investment. Some  127 million was invested in plant, machinery and vehicles.After allowing for higher prices this represents a slightly lower volume of investment. Most of the extra  125 million invested in stocks in 1971 representsgreater expenditure to maintain the same volume of crops and livestock butthere was some rise in volume terms as well.Production costs (Table 17)28. The main increases in costs since the last Review are for labour, machinery and fertilisers. There has been a marked decrease in the cost of feedingstuffsin the past year and also a reduction in interest charges.Cost of agricultural support (Tables 18 and 19)29. The cost to public funds of agricultural support in 1971/72 is expected tobe about  339 million. This is some  70 million more than the outturn for1970/71 but less by about  4 million than the estimate as adjusted to take account of the determinations made after the 1971 Review. The sharp rise inthe total cost of support in 1971/72 is due mainly to increases in the guaranteed prices which were not matched by increases in market prices. The estimate for1972/73 made before this Review and therefore taking no account of the deter-determinations announced in this White Paper shows a marginal increase to  341million. Higher market prices are expected for fatstock, but reductions hereare expected to be offset by increases in deficiency payments for cereals. Thecost of the bacon stabilisation arrangements is not included in these figures. Itis estimated at  18 million in 1971/72 but less than this in 1972/73.Commodity trends (Tables 1, 2, 5-11)30. Cereals. The cereals acreage harvested in 1971 returned to the high levels of 1967 and 1968 (9.4 million acres). Growing and harvesting conditions were good and yields were well above those of recent years. Total production isestimated to be some 14f million tons. A bigger acreage was sown to winterwheat by December 1971 than at the same time in the previous year and thetotal cereals acreage in 1972 is expected to be slightly higher than in 1971.31. Potatoes. In 1971 the acreage planted was 6,000 acres below the target of 640,000 acres but, as in 1970, high yields produced a very large surplus.Prices have consequently been weak and market support operations have beenneeded in two successive years. For 1972 the target has been reduced to 605,000v acres and on the assumption that yields are below the high levels of the last twoyears production should correspond more closely to market demand. Even so,a substantial surplus could again occur.
32. Sugar beet. Yields have been high and the 1971 crop is the largest everrecorded. Consumption of sugar is at best static and committed supplies underthe Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and from home production now meet thewhole of domestic sugar consumption.33. Beef. Between June 1970 and June 1971 the number of breeding cowsagain increased. Within this total, the number of dairy cows, the main source of calves for beef, remained almost unchanged, but the number of beef cowsincreased. The expansion of the total breeding herd is expected to continue.The number of calves retained for beef is high. So, although in 1971 /72 suppliesof beef and veal, both home-fed and imported, are likely to be slightly lower than in 1970/71, there is now in prospect a firm increase in home-fed supplies in 1972/73.34. Sheep. The decline in the sheep breeding flock appears to have beenhalted and in the year to December 1971 a slight increase was recorded, thefirst since December 1965. The lambing season in 1971 was substantiallybetter than average due to good weather. Home-fed supplies of mutton and lamb in 1971/72 are expected to be lower than in 1970/71, but total supplies areexpected to be higher as a result of an increase in imports.35. Pigs. After a period of relative stability the breeding herd rose to reach a peak of 995,000 in March 1971. Since then, however, a decline has occurredand by December 1971 the breeding herd had fallen to about 958,000 (a decreaseof about 3 per cent from December 1970). There are now signs that the fall isbeing checked but some further decline seems likely. Supplies of pigmeat forpork and manufacture in 1971/72 are expected to be higher than in the previous year and bacon production is expected to be about 6 per cent up. The level ofproduction provided for the home industry under the Bacon Market SharingUnderstanding for 1972/73 is 265,000 tons.36. Milk. The dairy herd has remained more or less static, but averagemilk yields per cow have been higher. There are now signs that dairy cownumbers may be increasing. Total sales through the Milk Marketing schemes in 1971/72 are expected to be higher than in 1970/71. Within this total, sales for manufacture into milk products have been an increasingly important outlet.37. Eggs.  Output in 1971/72 is expected to be slightly down on last year.

For 1972/73 the basis of the commodity guarantees and the conditions of payment for the relevant production grants will be the same as for 1971/72, except where indicated in the following paragraphs.Cereals40. The target indicator prices for wheat and barley are being retained andwill be determined for the 1972 crop at a later stage. It is proposed that the calculation should have regard in part to the price levels established under theexisting minimum import price arrangements and in part to the effective levelof threshold prices under the common agricultural policy which will operatesubsequently.Sugar beet41. The maximum acreage to which the guarantee will apply will be 443,000acres for the 1972 and 1973 crops.Fatstock general42. Guarantee payments for fatstock are made weekly by reference to standardprices. For cattle and sheep these arrangements should normally mean that,on average, producers receive exactly the guaranteed price&apos;for the year thoughfor pigs the calculation of deficiency payments involves some estimation so thatproducers&apos; average returns may differ slightly from the guaranteed price. Ineach case, however, producers&apos; average returns including deficiency payments from sales of eligible stock may exceed the guaranteed price for the year, ifmarket prices go higher than the standard prices in some weeks and in othersdeficiency payments are made. For cattle and sheep this may also happenwhen marketings and prices differ from those forecast when the scales of standardprices are prepared.Fat cattle43. The revised guarantee arrangements which were introduced on 5th July1971 will continue unchanged except that the target indicator price for 1972/73
as a whole will be  12-00 per live cwt. With effect from 27th March 1972 new scales of weekly standard prices and weekly target indicator prices will beintroduced and these scales will be adjusted to take account of the expectedmarket situation for. the year.  The new scales are being published separately.Fat sheep44. The revised guarantee arrangements which were introduced on 5th July1971 will continue unchanged except that the estimated price for the year as awhole will be 19-Op per lb. estimated dressed carcase weight. With effect from27th March 1972 new scales of weekly standard prices and weekly estimatedprices will be introduced and these scales will be adjusted to take account of the expected market situation for the year. The new scales are being publishedseparately.Fat pigs45. The middle band under the flexible guarantee was determined after the1971 Annual Review at 13-35-14-75 million certifications and raised to 14-0-15-million certifications in August 1971. With effect from 27th March 1972 theflexible guarantee scale will be as follows:Forecast level Adjustment to theof certifications basic guaranteed price13-45 million or more but less than 13-75 million 414p13-75     ,, 14-05                       +9P14-05 14-35                       4-4p14-35     ,,         ,,     ,,      ,, 15-00            Basic guaranteed price15-00     ,, 15-30                       -4p15-30    ,, 15-60 ,,                -9p15-60    ,,         ,, 15-90 ,,                -14pThere will be a further adjustment of 5p for each complete 0-3 million, or part thereof, by which the forecast level of certifications falls below 13-45 million or exceeds 15-9 million.46. The feed price of  1-96 per cwt. to which the new guaranteed price is related is deemed to be equivalent to 1,000 points on an index representing theprice of a feed ration. For every movement of 6-8 points from 1,000 points(equivalent to about 1 -33p per cwt.), the guaranteed price will be adjusted bylp per score.Milk47. The standard quantities for each milk marketing area in 1971/72 asadjusted in July 1971 and the standard quantities for 1972/73 are set out inthe table below. No adjustments are being made this year in respect of changesin liquid sales. The standard quantity for Northern Ireland has been adjusted,and the guaranteed price for Northern Ireland increased by 0-15p per gallonto the England and Wales level, so as to reduce&apos;disparities in pool prices.

The estimated producer price will remain unchanged in 1972/73 at 15-5pper dozen for both hen and duck eggs.49. It is proposed that extra small eggs should in future be eligible for thesubsidy, but the standard quantity for hen eggs will remain at 651 million dozenfor 1972/73.Production grants50. Fertiliser subsidy. The rates of grant will, subject to parliamentary approval, be reduced by the equivalent of  20 million for deliveries on or after1st June 1972.51. Winter keep grants. Scottish farmers have the option of receivingacreage grants on winter keep crops as an alternative to the headage paymentsshown in the table above. The acreage grants will be increased by 50p per acre so that the three rates will become  5-50,  4 and  3 per acre. The supple-ment payable on eligible hill sheep on Scottish farms receiving acreage grantwill be increased to 12^p per head.52. Farm business recording scheme. As already announced no furtherapplications will be accepted after 14th May 1972.Capital grants53. Farm capital grant scheme. The special two-year increase in the ratesof the main farm capital grants ends this year. It is proposed that grants for field drainage should continue at the enhanced rates of 70 per cent on hill land and 60 per cent elsewhere. But for all other works and facilities, applicationsreceived after 18th March 1972 will not be eligible for the higher rates of thelast two years. It is also proposed that, for applications received after 31stMarch 1972, grants for land clearance, reclamation and ploughing, for hedgeremoval, for fencing, for shelter belts, and for sheep and cattle grids should be discontinued except in hill areas and that grants for destruction of cover forrabbits and for claying and marling should also be terminated.54. Horticulture improvement scheme. Subject to Parliamentary approval,the combined rate of grant (including investment supplement) will be raised from 35 to 40 per cent with effect from 10th April 1972.

For notes see over.Number of holdings, crop acreages and livestock numbers (a)
(o) Up to 1969 the figures for Great Britain relate to agricultural holdings exceeding one acre in extent, but inJune 1968 about47,000 holdings were excluded from the census in England and Wales on the grounds that theywere not statistically significant. Their exclusion did not affect the cropping and stocking figures for the UnitedKingdom for that year by more than 0-4 per cent in the case of any single item shown in this table.In Scotland 16,000 holdings (accounting for less than 0-1 per cent of United Kingdom agricultural output)were excluded on the same grounds with effect from June 1970.Between June 1969 and June 1970 some 10,000 holdings in England and Wales were &quot;statistically amalgamated&quot;.These holdings, farmed with other holdings as part of a larger single farm unit, were formerly returnedseparately but are now returned as part of the larger unit.With effect from June 1970 the definition of agricultural holdings was widened in Great Britain to include some 2,300 statistically significant holdings on one acre or less of agricultural land. The figures now relateto all known holdings with 26 standard man-days or more (a standard man-day represents 8 hours productivework by an adult male worker under average conditions); holdings with less than 26 standard man-days areincluded only if they have 10 acres or more of crops and grass or at least one regular whole-time worker.The cropping and stocking figures returned by holdings on one acre or less account for significant differences between the census results for June 1970 and those for previous years only in the case of pigs and fowls.The figures in square brackets in the table show the number of pigs and fowls excluding those on holdings inGreat Britain with one acre or less.Figures for Northern Ireland relate to holdings of one acre or more, except for numbers of livestock, which arecollected from all owners, irrespective of the size of the holding, and also from landless stockholders.(6 ) Includes acreages of other crops and bare fallow not shown in the table.(c)   Includes lucerne.id) Includes common rough grazings. The fall of nearly 1 million acres in the area of rough grazings between1969 and 1970 is largely accounted for by the exclusion from the census of the 16,000 statistically insignificantholdings in Scotland referred to in note (a).(e) &quot; Other land &quot; in Great Britain means woodland and areas under roads, yards, buildings, etc., the use of whichis ancillary to the farming of the land; in Northern Ireland it includes land within agricultural holdings whichis under bog, water, roads, buildings, etc., and waste land not used for agriculture. Returns of&quot; other land &quot;were collected for the first time in England and. Wales in June 1969 and the area returned then (208,000 acres)is understated. It is estimated that that figure includes some 53,CC0 acres and the 1970 figure (376,000) includessome 96,000 acres previously returned as crops and grass or rough grazing.if) Figures for years earlier than 1964 are for fowls six months old and over in Great Britain and five months oldand over in Northern Ireland.(g) Includes ducks, geese, turkeys and fowls for breeding.(h) Revised figure.(0  Includes 3,000 acres of maize for threshing.Table 2Estimated average yields of crops and livestock productsJune/May years	Unit	Average of 1960/61-1962/63	1967/68 (ft)	1968/69	1969/70	1970/71	1971/72 (forecast) (d)Crops							Wheat Barley Oats  ...	cwt./acre tons/acre	30-5 26-7 21-7 P..R	33-3 30-1 27-0 100 2-4	28-2 27-4 25-6 9-8 2-3	32-2 28-6 27-3 10-0 2-2	33-4 26-7 25-9 11-0 2-3	35-0 29-9 30-1 11-1 2-sugar(a)		0 o 2-2					Livestock products							Milk(6) Eggs(c)	galls./cow no./bird	767 191	811 208	801 211*	822 215	847 219*	853 224(a) Sugar-in-beet per crop acre.(6) Yield per dairy type cow per annum.(c) Up to 1962/63, eggs per adult fowl from all flocks.

They have not however significantly affected the trend in the average size of enterprise except for poultry in 1968 (following the elimination of the 47,000 holdings)and more generally in 1970 (following the statistical amalgamation of the 10,000 holdings, partly ofTset for pigs and poultry by the inclusion of the extra 2,300 holdings).(6) Excludes Northern Ireland.

The occupier&apos;s investmentincludes all tenant-type physical assets in livestock, crops, machinery, etc. but excludes any financial assets and all landlord-type assets such as land and buildings. The estimates of aggregate net income include a profit in recent years of about  5 million on the production of food for consumption in the farm household.In other industries the corresponding sums are not treated as profit and are relatively much smaller (in manycases non-existent).(c) The series measures year to year changes in the value added at constant prices by farmers, landowners andfarmworkers, to all the goods and services purchased from outside the agricultural sector.((/) Labour productivity is here defined as gross product per person engaged in agriculture. Gross product is grossoutput less all inputs other than depreciation, labour, net rent and interest. It is here measured at constant1964/67 prices. In order to be consistent with national economic conventions gross product as used in the calculation of labour productivity covers agricultural contractors as well as all commercially significant holdings.

(a) These figures are collected by Universities and Agricultural Colleges in Great Britain and the Ministry ofAgriculture in Northern Ireland. They are weighted averages based on census distribution of agricultural holdings by type of farming and size of business. More detailed figures for England and Wales are published in &quot;Farm Incomes in England and Wales 1970/71 &quot; (H.M.S.O.). Corresponding information for scotland will appear in &quot;Scottish Agricultural Economics 1972&quot;: for Northern Ireland in &quot;The Northern IrelandFarm Management Survey 1970/71 &quot;: and for Wales in the &quot;Supplement to the Annual Digest of WelshStatistics 1970/71Net income is defined as for the aggregate net income calculation (Tables 12 and 13), except that herenet income is calculated before deduction of interest on any commercial debt. All farms are treated as rentedand an imputed rental value is charged as an expense in the accounts of owner-occupiers.The accounts relate in the main to calendar years or to the year ending 5th April, for which income tax is assessed. The average year-ending date is about mid-February.(b) Includes &quot; mixed &quot; farm type.(c) Almost all farm businesses in Northern Ireland are based on owner-occupied holdings. As rents cannot beimputed with reference to tenanted farms, the rental charges entered for owned land and buildings have been assessed in relation to estimated sale value. Where hind was taken in conacre, the actual rents paid have been included. A high proportion of the labour on farms is family labour and the charge for this has been calculatedfor estimated hours worked at basic and overtime rates (no premiums, i.e. excess of total earnings over minimum rates, have been included). For these reasons the average net incomes per farm are not on the same basis asthose for Great Britain.(d) Includes &quot; cattle, sheep and pigs    &quot; pigs and poultry &quot; and &quot; cropping &quot; farm types.Table 17Aggregate cost changes taken into account at the Annual Review (a)  millionNet cost change relating to	all products	guaranteed production^)Feedingstuffs(c)...............     ......	-45-2	-25-4Seeds    ........................	- 0-5	- 0-4Livestock (imported and inter-farm expenses)     ......	4- 6-4	4- 6-3   &apos;Fertilisers and lime    ..................	1-11-3	+ 9-2Machinery (including depreciation)............	-f28-2	4-23-0Maintenance (including depreciation on equipment)	-4- 5-2	4- 3-miscellaneous          ..................	+ 12-4	4- 6-6Labour ........................	4-38-2	4-26-gross rent      .....................	-f- 5-2	4- 4-3Interest ......	- 8-3	- 60Transport and marketing     ...............	-!- 3-6	4- 1-9Less consolidated payments for training(rf)        ......	4-56-5	4-48-5 - 0-1Total...............		4-48-4(a) These estimates are made on the assumption that any increase or decrease in the cost of an item of expenditure will continue for a full year and that there will be no change from the current usage of that item.(b) Commodities of the descriptions and quantities for which guaranteed prices are provided.(c) Excludes changes in feedingstuffs costs which are dealt with automatically by the feed formula which relatesthe guarantee for pigs to the cost of a basic feed ration.(d) The sums payable to the Agricultural Training Board in Great Britain and to the Ministry of Agriculture for northern Ireland have been set at  2-0 million for 1972/73 as against the  1-9 million which was provided for1970/71 and 1971/72 and taken into account at the 1970 Annual Review.

The figures for 1972/73 are those in the correspondingCivil Estimates for that year (Class V, Votes 3, 4, 5, 6 and parts of Votes 2 and 7). The table excludes grants specificallyfor horticulture. The estimated cost of these, together withhorticultural co-operation and credit, is  9*7 million in1971/72 and  9-9 million in 1972/73.(b) Expenditure on the relevant production grants and on thespecial assistance grant to Northern Ireland is taken intoaccount together with the value of the price guarantees in calculating the total value of the guarantees.(c) Includes grants in respect of grassland renovation, rabbitclearance societies, producers in the Scottish Islands,agricultural marketing development, agricultural co-operation (excluding fixed equipment), agricultural credit and silos.(d) Includes grants in respect of livestock improvement, brackeneradication, and fixed equipment for agricultural co-operatives.(e) Payments in respect of cereals, potatoes and wool relatepartly to the crops or clip of the year indicated and partly tothe crops or clips in the preceding year or years.(/) These figures differ from the effect of the determinations onthe value of the guarantees chiefly because the price guarantee arrangements for some commodities do not involve Exchequerpayments and the payment periods for some items do not correspond with the financial year. In addition to the 48*3 million shown, increased rates of grant for horticulturalimprovements are estimated to cost an extra  0-8 million,making a total of  49*1 million.

(a) The figures for unit subsidy cover expenditure on implementing the price guarantees only. They do not includeagricultural production grants or administrative expenses.(b) The guaranteed price relates to a standard quantity only for wheat (1964/65-1967/68), for barley (1964/65-1968/69), for milk (throughout this period) and for eggs (1969/70-1971/72). From 1971/72 the basis of theguarantee for eggs changed from a guaranteed price to the British Egg Marketing Board to a guaranteedproducer price.(c) The figures for cereals are in respect of grain taken into account in the Cereals Deficiency Payments Scheme.id) The unit subsidy is taken to be the cost of support buying (plus any deficiency payment) related to the quantityof eligible potatoes sold through licenced channels for human consumption. It is not additional to producers&apos;returns from the market.(c) The figures for fatstock relate to animals certified under the Fatstock Guarantee Scheme. The unit subsidy for fat cattle and fat sheep includes any balancing payments made after the end of the fatstock year. Theaverage standard price and the unit subsidy for fat pigs include, where appropriate, quality premiums andadjustments under the flexible guarantee and feed price arrangements.(/) The net ex-farm price after deduction of transport charges paid to wholesale producers by the Milk marketing boards (the &quot; pool price &quot;). It covers both the standard quantity and milk outside the standard quantity soldfor manufacture at a lower price.(g) Until 1970/71 the average producer price (including subsidy) paid by the British Egg Marketing Board on first quality hen eggs: 1971/72 based upon prices notified by packers (including subsidy).(A) The average producer price paid by the British Wool Marketing Board. It includes the subsidy.PRINTED IN ENGLAND FOR HER MAJESTVS STATIONERY office by Williams Lea/WLP Group/LondonDd. 148276  K96  3/72
