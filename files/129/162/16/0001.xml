(confidential)REPORT OP THE REVIEW BODY ON ARMED forces pay AND ALLOWANCESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence the Armed Forces Pay Review Body has now submitted itsReport to the Prime Minister.   A copy is attached.2.     The Report covers the pay of ranks of Brigadier and below;higher ranks are dealt with by the Top Salaries Review Body;pay for medical and dental officers will be determined separately -ately when recommendations are made by the Doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; Review Body.3.     The Report does not introduce any important questions ofprinciple or change in structure of Service pay and allowances.It proposes increases in basic pay and certain major forms ofadditional pay, together with increases in food and aecommoda-tion charges.    In the cases of the additional pay and charges,the proposals are for interim rates; like other smallerelements of additional pay and allowances for which no changes are proposed at present, these will be subjected to further examination in the course of next year.k.     The main proposals are set out in Annex A.   The broad* effect of the Review Body&apos;s recommendations is for increases of:-a. From 1 April 1970 when Service pay was last reviewed by the NBPIAbout 18^f$ - ie, an average annual rate of3% compound.b. Since 1 August 1971 when the Services received an interim Increase of 1% on the 1970 ratesAbout 10$ for officersAbout J\J\% for Other Ranks- 1 -(confidential)
(confidential)Because the interim award was applied at a flat rate of J%across the hoard to basic pay and not applied to additionalpay relating to specific duties and qualifications and becausethe Pay Review Body have relied on relatively comprehensivedata derived from job evaluation studies, the order of theproposed increases varies widely by rank and length of service,between limits of 2% and M\.% for men, and 5% and A6% for women,where progress is envisaged towards equal pay.   The netadditional cost of the changes is  69m in 1972/73.5.     The Review Body proposes in the course of the next yearto carry out further work in connection with the questionsmentioned in paragraph 3, and to carry out a further review in not more than two years.    They have, however, expressedthe view that, so long as civilian earnings continue toincrease rapidly, there might be &quot;serious injustice&quot; ifService pay was left unchanged for as long as two years, andthey may feelv it necessary to make recommendations earlier.Their proposals, which are essentially related to conditionsobtaining at the end of 1971, contain no element for futureinflation.6.      In making their recommendations, the Review Body havestated that they have had regard to the national interest tobring about a reduction in the rate of increase in money incomes as well as the need to keep the remuneration of theServices at a fair level in relation to conditions outside.The Government have undertaken to accept the reports of the review Bodies unless there are clear and compelling reasonsfor not doing so.    I see none in this case.   The official committee on Pay Negotiations has considered the Report andrecommends acceptance of its conclusions.7.     I invite the Committee to agree that the Government should accept all the recommendations of the Review Body on armed forces Pay and that the increases in pay and charges should beapplied from 1 April.    I would propose that the decision shouldbe announced after the Recess (with the simultaneous publicationof the Report) preferably by reply to oral questions in bothHouses, on the first convenient occasion after the Recess.C.Ministry of DefenceLondon SW129 March 1972- 2
(confidential)ANNEX ABASIC PAYThe Review Body has reached its conclusions in the lightof results of the job evaluation studies and other comparativedata which has been developed along the lines originallyestablished for the earlier review by the NBPI.    Broadly, theyconcluded that:-a. There was little justification for increasing payat the recruit level, for officers and other ranks.b. At the Corporal level (the pay link with the maincivilian comparators in the job evaluation studies),the evidence suggested an increase since April 1970of 22%-25%.c. For officers, the evidence suggested an increaseof 16 - 19% since April 1970.d. There was no evidence at present to suggest a changein the relativity in pay between Warrant Officersand Captains.Taking account of the Service rank and trade structure, andthe limit imposed for other ranks by the effects of a. and d.,the Review Body&apos;s considerations led to a rather smallerincrease at the Corporal level than might otherwise have been justified.2.     Examples of relative proposed increases by comparisonwith current (August 1971) rates are:Recruits - 77p weekly increase to  19.53 (h.1%)Corporal -  k.20 weekly increase to  36.75 (12.9%)Staff Sergeant -  h.3k weekly increase to  k3.k7 (8.0$)2/Lieutenant -  31 annual increase to  1,750 (1.8%)Major -  326 annual increase to  3,h50 (10.4%)Brigadier -  766 annual increase to  6,900 (12.5%)THE X-FACTOR3.     The X-Factor is added to compensate for the disadvantages of Service life.    No changes are proposed on this occasion inthe current rates (5 per cent for men, 1 per cent for women),except for a minor change in the upper limit so as not to restrict its application consequent on increases in basic rates.3 -
(confidential)THE WOMEN&apos;S SERVICESU.      It is proposed to increase women1s rates of pay from90$ to 93^-$ of male rates (both sides exclusive of the X-factor)as a step towards equal pay, coupled with some restrictionson length of service pay.    This is an interim step; the review body wish to consider a number of questions about women&apos;strades before reaching final conclusions about the applicationof equal pay.COMMITTAL pay.      Committal pay, which is paid to other ranks at different rates in respect of particular lengths of engagement, has notbeen increased since 1969, apart from the application of the$ interim increase in August 1971.    The Review Body propose an increase of 21$,  ie, 30$ in all over the three years since1969.LENGTH OF SERVICE PAY6.     Length of Service Pay consists of increments payable inrespect of service beyond 9 years.    Certain structural changes are proposed, which make precise comparisons difficult, butthe order of increase is about 13$ by comparison with current(August 1971) rates or 20-21$ since April 1970.ADDITIONAL pay.     The Review Body propose increases of about 18$ in the major forms of additional pay (Flying Pay, Submarine Pay,Parachute Pay) which have not been increased since April 1970,and to which (with one small exception) the interim increases were not applied in August 1971.    Consideration of other formsof additional pay has been deferred.FOOD CHARGES8.     The Review Body propose a further increase in food charges of 7$ by comparison with current (August 1971) rates, making atotal increase since April 1970 of about 17$.    This is intendedas an interim measure, pending a more thorough review of themethod of assessing food charges.ACCOMMODATION CHARGES &apos;9.     The NBPI Report in 1970 provided for staging of increases in charges for married quarters and a formula for futurecalculation related to rents for council houses.    Charges were increased by 7$ in August 1971.    The outstanding issue ofstaging and the rise in council house rents would have led tocomparatively sharp increases in relation to the actual pay increases for junior ranks.   The Review Body have doubts aboutthe current formula and propose to re-examine this question.- k -(CONFIDENTIAL)
(confidential)Meanwhile they have proposed interim increases.   depending on the type of quarters, the increases vary from -\2% to 30%by comparison with current (August 1971) rates.10.    In the case of accommodation charges for single menwhich are related to the formula for married quarters and whichwere not staged in April 1970,  or increased in August 1971,it is proposed to apply the full calculated increase whichamounts to 17 to 13%.29 March 1972- 5 -(confidential)

CHAPTER 1INTRODUCTION1.   We were formally appointed in September 1971 with the terms of reference:&quot;To advise the Prime Minister on the pay and allowances of members of Naval,Military and Air Forces of the Crown and of any women&apos;s serviceadministered by the Defence Council.&quot;We were asked to relate our first review  to   1 April   1972.We were informed that further reviews should normally be undertaken at 2-yeaxlyintervals, and that our recommendations would be accepted by the Governmentunless there were clear and compelling reasons for their not doing so.2,   Our responsibility is thus to advise on the pay and allowances of over350,000 men in the Armed Forces, and about 15,000 women in the women&apos;s Services;at current rates, these amount in all to  747m. a year, or rather more thanone-quarter of the total Defence Budget of  2,854m.3.   Two other Review Bodies were appointed at about the same time.   One, the top Salaries Review Body, is responsible for advising the Prime Minister onthe pay of the chairmen and members of the boards of nationalised industries;the higher Judiciary! senior Civil Servants; and senior Officers of the armed forces.   Senior officers are defined for this purpose as Major Generals and above; our own terms of reference must, therefore, be interpreted as applying to the ranks up to and including Brigadier^.   The third Review Body is the doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body, which deals with the remuneration of doctors and dentists in the National Health Service.4.   The advice we give to the Government must be consistent, both in relationto the general problems that concern any advisory body dealing with pay, and to particular areas where there is a link between the groups dealt with by thethree Bodies,   For example, our recommendations on the pay of officers in the rank of Brigadier and below, and those made by the Top Salaries Review Body fox(l)   Here, and elsewhere in this report when the context allows, references toArmy ranks are intended to include the equivalent ranks in the other Services.
^lajor Generals and above must clearly be  related to each other.   Similarly, in recommending rates of pay for medical and dental officers in the Armed Forces,we need to have regard to the recommendations made by the doctors and Dentists&apos;Review Body about the pay of doctors and dentists in the National Health Service.In order to ensure consistency in these matters, there is an interlocking member-ship between the three Review Bodies; two of our members are also members of the top Salaries Review Body, and one is a member of the Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; review body.   The three Review Bodies have, in addition, a common secretariat providedby the Office of Manpower Economics (OME).%  All three Review Bodies are concerned with groups that have no machinery for settling pay by collective bargaining.   Certain groups dealt   with by the otherReview Bodies, however, have representative bodies that can give evidence ontheir behalf.   Others, including the Armed Forces and women&apos;s Services, have none.Cur impressions of the attitude of servicemen towards their pay are drawn fromdiscussions with individuals and informal groups during the visits we have paidto Service units, and from discussions with senior officers and officials in theMinistry of Defence.   Most of us have been or are concerned with employmentconditions in the Armed Forces or in civil life.6.  Until 1970, servicemen were paid partly in cash and partly by the provisionof food and accommodation which were, in principle, free.   Married men received an additional cash payment known as a marriage allowance and, when living withtheir families, a ration allowance (which was free of income tax) in place ofService rations.   The rents charged by the Services for public married quarterswere significantly lower than the general level of non-Service rents for similaraccommodation, the difference being intended as partial compensation for thefrequent moves aasociated with life in the Services.^7.   Employment conditions in the Armed Forces   were reviewed in 1958by the Advisory Committee on Recruiting,   under the Chairmanship of Sir(2)James Griggv 1,      Pay had previously been reviewed only at irregularintervals and the Committee recommended a system of regular reviews(l) There were two scales of marriage allowance in the United Kingdom; the &quot;in-quarters&quot; scale paid to men occupying public married quarters and a higher(o\ fscale paid *0 those in private accommodation,W The Committee&apos;s report was published as Cmnd 545.- 2 -
every two years.   Under this system, which became known as the &quot;Grigg formula&quot;,changes in officers1 pay were determined by reference to changes in the pay ofthe executive and administrative grades of the home Civil Service, and changesin other ranks&apos; pay by reference to changes in average earnings in manufacturing and other industries,   Servicemen thus had an assurance that their pay would be adjusted periodically to take account of changes in earnings in civil life; butin other respects the basic system of pay remained unaltered;   the serviceman&apos;sremuneration was, as before, partly in cash and partly in kind, and married andsingle men were paid at different rates.   There was no direct relationship between military pay and the amount a serviceman might have expected to earn ifhe had been doing a job of comparable responsibility in civil life pud the real value of total remuneration was difficult to ascertain.8,  In November 1965, the Government asked the National Board for Prices and incomes (NBPI) to advise them whether the increases in pay that were due inApril 1966 under the Grigg formula were consistent with the criteria laid downin the then current White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy, ^ In its reportof January 1966^ 1 the NBPI said that until the Government notified servicemenof the adoption of a new system of review it was committed to the existing system and the pay increases should be made.   At the same time, the Board questioned whether the methods of comparing civilian and Service pay used in the Griggformula could be reconciled with the White Paper criteria.9-  Before the next biennial review was due, in April, 1968, the Government madethe pay of the Armed Forces the subject of a Standing Reference to the NBPI.   Inits first report ^ under this reference, the NBPI recommended a pay increase of  per cent as an interim measure, and stated that it would undertake a review ofthe structure of Service pay and of the most appropriate method of determining it for the future.(l)   Cmnd 2639(2)   NBPI Report No. 10, Cmnd 2881(3)   NBPI Report No. 70, Cmnd 3651, May 1968
. confidential910.   The first stage of this work was the subject of the next report^ inwhich, in addition to proposals concerning pay and allowances in the immediatefuture (including an interim pay increase of 3a per cent) there were long-term proposals .for changing the whole structure of Service pay.   Specifically, the .NBPI recommended the introduction of a comprehensive &quot;military salary&quot; whichwould be subject to tax in the normal way and out of which servicemen would berequired to pay for their food and accommodation in the same way as civilians.Married and single men would be paid the same for similar work and special allowances should be eliminated, as far as reasonable and practicable.   Itwould then be possible to make direct comparisons between Service and civilianpay.   Salaries for the different ranks and Service trades should be determined in the light of comparisons of job size (using job evaluation techniques) with earnings for jobs of comparable skill and responsibility in civil life after making due allowance for other conditions of service.   Certain features ofService life were, however, considered unique in combination, and incapable ofmeasurement by standards drawn from civilian life.   The most important of thesefeatures were danger; frequent moves from place to place; military discipline,which involved restrictions on personal liberty not normally endured in civil life; and the inability freely to change jobs.   These needed to be set againstthe advantages which the serviceman had over most civilians, notably a greaterbreadth of training and the chance to carry responsibility  when young,coupled with a greater economic security than was enjoyed by most civilians.The balance of advantage and disadvantage was judged to be a factor - referredto as the X factor - adverse to military life requiring an addition to the basicsalary as determined by reference to job size alone.(2)11.   In a further report,    &apos; vafter job evaluation studies which incorporatedcomparisons with civilian earnings, the NBPI recommended the levels of salaries(1)  NBPI Report No,ll6, Cmnd 4079, June 1969(2)   11BPI Report No. 142, Cmnd 4291, February 1970
-   5to be paid, and the charges to be made for food and accommodation.   It also made recommendations about a range of items including additional pay and allow-ances.   The recommendations were accepted by the Government and put into effect from 1 April 1970, except that the pay increase for single men (needed to bring their total pay into line with that of married men) was staged; part being implemented from 1 April 1970, and the remainder from 1 April 1971.12.   The 1970 rates of pay were thus the first to be based on direct comparisonsbetween military and civilian jobs.   The HBPI proposed that the level of pay should be reviewed every two years, with a more thorough reconsideration of theinternal pay structure and its relationships with civilian employment at regular intervals of perhaps six years.   However, because of the rapid rise in prices and civilian earnings in 1970 and 1971, the Government, in August 1971, increased the rates of pay by 7 per cent as an interim step, pending the preparation ofour first report.   The charges for food and accommodation were increased at thesame time and in roughly the same proportions.
CHAPTER 2confidentialTHE PRESENT PAY STRUCTURE13.     One of the basic needs of the military salary system is to relate pay to the degree of skill and responsibility attached to a serviceman&apos;s job -the &quot;size&quot; of the job.   Job size can be assessed by different systems of job evaluation which,broadly speaking, enable jobs to be ranked in order of sizeby attaching appropriate weightings to the training and experience required,the physical and mental demands the job imposes, and the degree ofresponsibility it entails.   The methods used in the Armed Forces are described in the NBPI reports of June 1969 (Appendices 6 and 7) and February1970 (Appendix 6).14.     It was found that the sizes of most officers&apos; jobs were fairly closely related to the rank of the officer, regardless of the Service in which hewas employed.   Some of the minor differences in the rates of pay in thethree Services, which had previously existed, were therefore abolished.Single rates of pay are fixed for Second Lieutenants and for Brigadiers; inthe remaining ranks, from Lieutenant to Colonel, there are incremental payscales, the increments being related to service in the rank or to totalcommissioned service.   Some categories of officers eg doctors and dentists,lawyers and veterinary surgeons, have special rates of pay; and there isadditional pay for certain duties (flying, service in submarines and para-chute units, etc).   There are also special pay rates for former NCO&apos;s whoenter commissioned service in relatively junior ranks   when they are olderthan officers commissioned direct from civil life.15.    The job sizes of other ranks were found to be less closely related to(1)rank    .   The Armed Forces need men torrj --:-- &apos;----/The 1970 study was made principally at Corporal level;   but extended studiessenior NCOs and Warrant Officers described in Chapter 8 and Appendix 2confirm that a wide spread of job sizes exists within each rank, with a ,considerable degree of overlap between ranks.- 6 -
confidentialdo a wide variety of jobs, many requiring high mental and physical skillsand the acceptance of considerable responsibility without necessarilyinvolving the command over other men that requires high rank.Unlike officers, for whom the bigger jobs are, in general, accompanied byhigher rank, other ranks may be rewarded for bigger jobs by higher rates of pay only.   On the other hand, rank may be awarded for reasonsother than job size or the command function.   It may, for example, be directly related to length of service; or to the need to provide a careerstructure.   For these reasons there are considerable variations in job sizewithin the same rank.    (This was recognised in the Armed Forces pay systemseven before any formal job evaluation had been used; in the Army and RAF,the Service trades which required higher skills were paid at higher rates,rank for rank, at all ranks from private to Warrant Officer.   In the Navy,at the rank of Petty Officer and above there were, in parallel with the Armyand RAF, higher rates for the more highly skilled trades but there was nodifferentiation in pay at lower ranks up to Leading Rate.)1o.     It would not be practicable to have a large number of different ratesof pay to reflect minor differences In job size, and the system adopted in1970 groups the Service trades in the Array and RAF into three bands.   Band 3twhich contains the most highly skilled trades, carries a higher rate of paythan Band 2, which contains less highly skilled trades; and Band 2 carries ahigher rate of pay than Band 1.   In the Army and RAF the pay of any service-man from private to Warrant Officer thus depends partly on his rank andpartly on the pay band to which his Service trade is allocated.   In the Navy,a single band was adopted up to Leading Rate.  /(Recruits are paid on scalesequivalent to Band 1 as in the other Services, and Able and Leading  ratings&quot; onscales equivalent to Band 2.)   At Petty Officer and above, most tradesremain in Band 2 but some of the more highly skilled trades are paid on higher scales, broadly equivalent to Band 3.-7 -
17.     The division of pay rates into three bands, broadly dependent on theskills and responsibilities of the trades, is complicated by the payment of&quot;committal pay&quot; to those who engage to serve for more than the minimum period.   Thus, for those committed to serve for less than six years there isa basic scale of pay in the three bands, known as scale A.   For thosecommitted to serve for six but less than nine years there is a scale knownas scale B which is at present  1.V? a week above scale A; whilst for thosecommitted to serve for nine or more years, there is scale C - at present 3.78 above scale A.   There are thus, in principle, nine rates of pay at each rank.   As, however, many ranks embody a number of classes, eg PrivateClass I, II, III and IV, there can be still more rates of pay for one rank,dependent on class, scale and band.   Henceforth, in this report, where a scale is required for illustrative purposes in our recommendations, we usescale B, ie the scale for those committed to serve for six but less thannine years.18.     In addition to pay by rank, class, scale end band other ranks receivelength of service increments of pay, varying by rank and length of service,after a minimum of nine years1 service.   They may also (like officers)receive additional pay for special duties such as flying or service in sub-marines or parachute units.19*    Finally, both officers and other ranks are eligible for variousallowances in particular circumstances (eg Local Overseas Allowance,Education Allowance) or more generally (eg leave travel warrants).   It isnot possible to make an absolutely clear distinction between items termedadditional pay and those described as allowances.   Local Overseas Allowance,for example, is a payment designed to increase a serviceman&apos;s pay in anoverseas station to maintain an equivalent purchasing power to that enjoyedin the UK and is therefore of the nature of pay.   Other allowances are of- 8 -
- 9the same type.   As a broad generalisation, however, additional pay is related to the nature of a man&apos;s work or his committal to it, whilst allov-ances are related to his circumstances.20.     Payments which are described above as allowances amount to some  81 m.out of the total of  7^7 m. to which we referred in paragraph 2, whilstadditional pay accounts for about  10 m.
CHAPTER 3OUR APPROACH TO OUR TASK21.   As a review body charged with the duty of recommending pay for largenumbers of men and women who have no negotiating machinery, we must seek to ensure that pay is and remains fair in relation to pay in other walksof life.   This is not only a matter of equity.   In this country, unlikemost others, the Armed Forces are made up entirely of volunteers.   although there is no evidence of any direct relationship between pay and the levels of recruitment and retention, we believe that unless servicemen and potentialrecruits have a continuing assurance that their pay will be kept roughly in line with the level of pay in civil life it will be impossible to recruit andretain all the men and women the Services need to carry out the obligationsplaced upon them in the national interest.   In this connection, the White(1)Paper &quot;Statement on.the Defence Estimates 1972&quot;        indicates a strikingimprovement in recruiting during the past year and an increase in the numbersof servicemen   prolonging their service.   There seems little doubt, however,that continuing adverse demographic factors, the imminent raising of the school leaving age, and the relaxation of terms of engagement will place increasingemphasis on retention, ie the need for prolongation of service by committal andby re - engagement.   In recommending rates of pay, we also need to bear inmind the fact that the pay of the Services is a large item in the total public expenditure;   and, in present circumstances, the importance which the Govern-ment attaches to bringing about a reduction in the rate of increase in money incomes in the economy as a whole.22.   The determination of fair rates of pay requires reliable methods of comparison.   The NBPI&apos;s introduction, in 1970; of job evaluation in order &quot;togive an indication of the levels of pay in civilian employment for jobs which(1; Crand 4891. February 1972.
confidentialare comparable in terms of skill and responsibility with jobs in the   Services&quot;was an important innovation.   We agree with the principles of these comparisons,and intend to continue using them, complementing them where necessary byinformation from salary surveys and index figures for the movement of earnings and prices.23.   The use of. job evaluation and other information   cannot, however, provide an exact indication of the proper   level of Service pay; the process of determining fair levels cannot be reduced to a formula.   In civil life thereare very wide variations, both in the level of pay for apparently similarjobs, and in the differentials between jobs.   Information on civil pay istherefore a guide to judgement, not a substitute for it.   Even if the equiv-alent civilian &quot;rate for the job&quot; could be determined more exactly than is actually the case it would not be right to import all the features of civilianpay structures into the Services.   Service pay must be determined in the context of a rank structure that is- different from the rank structures generallyfound in civil life; and because of the special recuitment needs of the Services,and the high cost of military training, Service pay must embody incentives formen to commit themselves to extended periods of service, and to prolong theircommitment when they have the opportunity, in a way that is not appropriate to civilian employment.24,   Service pay must take account also of the nature of a Service career,whilst it is important that men should be encouraged to serve beyond the minimum period, the emphasis must, nevertheless be on youth.   Most servicemen,therefore,must leave the Services (whether or not they wish to do so) at a comparativelyearly age and find other work.   Even for the minority who attain high rank, or who can be retained in the Services for other reasons, retirement comes earlier than in civil life, and usually involves the need to start a second career in middle age.   Pensions do not come within our terms of reference, but their valueought to be taken into account&apos; as part of the total remuneration that servicemenreceive and be related to the special features of a Service career.   This is a-   11  -
matter we may need to consider in future reviews, though, as pensions are currently under review by the Government, we have been unable to do so onthis occasion.25.   Finally, Service pay must acknowledge the balance of advantages and disadvantages in the features of Service 1 ife that are summed up in the X-factor.   This element in pay is not related to movements in civilian earnings,or indeed to any civilian standards of measurement, and may therefore need tobe reviewed independently of the consideration of other factors affecting pay,26,   The recommendations in the present report are based on a relatively shortstudy of pay and conditions in the Services; further, the Services themselves have had little time as yet to adjust themselves to the structural changes in pay that were introduced in 1970.   In these circumstances, it would not be rightto propose any far reaching changes.   Our main recommendations, therefore, are designed to do no more than make adjustments to rates of pay and differentialsin the light of the changes that have occurred in civilian earnings during thelast two years.   We have also made recommendations on food and accommodationcharges; these are of an interim nature, pending further consideration.27,   Although there was a considerable measure of simplification in 1970,the structure of Service pay and allowances is still complex.   A complexstructure can lead not only to excessive administrative cost, but, more import-ant, to dissatisfaction among servicemen themselves..   The payment of many items of additional pay and allowances is governed by intricate rules, and it isdoubtful whether all these can be justified, and indeed whether some of these items serve the purposes for which they were originally intended,   Y\re have made recommendations to bring up to date the rates of payment in some instances,where we think that action ought not to be postponed,   but we intend to under-take additional studies during the next twelve months or so with the aim ofmaking a further report early in 1973.-   12   -
28.   In Chapters 4-7. we consider, and make recommendations on military salariesthe pay of the women1 s Services j; additional pay and special pay scales; and charges for food and accommodation; based on the approach we have adopted anddescribed above.-   13
29.     We now examine the specific considerations which, together with the more general aims described in the previous chapter, have led to our recommendations.Movements in Civilian Pay30.     Comparisons can be made between civilian and Service pay at a number ofdifferent levels.   In the first place, comparisons can be drawn between youngcivilians starting their careers and young men entering the Services either as other ranks or officers.   The 1970 rates of pay for Privates Class IV and second Lieutenants,which included the equivalent of the former marriage allowance, were recognised by the NBPI to compare favourably with the payobtainable at the start of a career in civil life.   The Board said that &quot;giventhe present favourable position, the pay adjustments we may recommend in futurereviews will not necessarily keep step with the adjustments recommended for men with longer service&quot;.   In August 1971. however, these rates were included inthe &quot;across the board&quot; award of a 7 per cent increase.   We have carried out a survey in a number of large companies of the starting salaries and early salaryprogressions of graduate recruits to management end the professions and have,in addition, obtained information on the current pay levels of young employees(under the age of 21) in manual and clerical employment.   We are satisfied thatthe present starting salaries of new entrants to the Armed Forces still compare favourably with those of their counterparts in civilian life, and that if theyare to be increased at all on this occasion, the increases should be small.31.    The next level where comparisons are particularly relevant is at the rank of Corporal, and it was indeed at this rank that the NBPI carried out the job(1)evaluated comparisons described in its report of February 1970     .   The(1)NBPI Report No. 1^2, Cmnd 4291, February 1970 Appendix 6.- 1*1- -CHAPTER &apos;l-MILITARY SALARIES
- 15 -Ministry of Defence and OME have obtained up-to-date information about the pay for the civilian jobs evaluated in the NBPI sample.   The inquiry was intendedto cover the whole^of the sample of 728 jobs used in 19^9, but in the event,usable replies were obtained for only ^10.   We gratefully acknowledge the good-will and co-operation of over two hundred firms and public authorities whoprovided the data, and facilities for re-examination of the jobs, without whichthis part of the study could not have been carried out.   The information obtained from this smaller sample suggests that the average earnings in jobswhich formerly corresponded to those of Corporal in the three Service pay bandsincreased by 25 to 28 per cent between November 1969 and November 1971.   How-ever, re-evaluation of a random sample of the jobs (covering about one-fifth ofthe total) suggested that there had been an increase in job size.   One quarterof the job sizes, as measured by the job evaluation system employed, had risen by between 1 and k$ per cent, the average increase being between 9 and 10 percent.   None of the jobs in the random sample had decreased in size.32.     It is not possible to state with precision the extent to which the equivalent service rates of pay would be reduced by this increase in civilianjob sizes but it is probably right to say that the average earnings of the truecivilian comparators to the Corporal have increased by about 22 to 25 per cent over their 1969 levels.   The increase in the average earnings of male manual workers in general in roughly the same period, as published by the Departmentof Employment, falls within this range.33.    Finally, comparisons can be made between civilian earnings and those ofofficers in the ranks from Captain to Brigadier.   With the aid of the manage-ment consultants formerly employed for this purpose by the NBPI we havecompared the earnings of officers with those attaching to jobs of similar sizein more than 100 organisations using the same system of evaluation.   Aftertalcing the latest available figures and adjusting them to take account of
confidentialdifferences in pension arrangements, and of the bonuses and company cars that&apos;frequently form part of civilian remuneration, v/e found that the levels of paynow appropriate represented a range of increases between 16 and 19 per cent over the military salaries that were introduced in April 1970.Relativities within the ServicesJh,     V/e need to take account of two other factors.   First, the 1970 pay scalesdid not make any major change in the relativities between the pay of seniorNC0&apos;s and Warrant Officers, and of junior commissioned officers that had existed in the past.   Because these relativities are based on custom and practice and are not necessarily justified by the relative job sizes, a pilotstudy was undertaken to examine the relationships in job sizes between theseranks.   No evidence has been found as yet which would justify any departure from the existing relativities.   Thus the levels of pay of senior NC0*s andWarrant Officers should not, for the present, be such as to disturb theserelativities.   We intend to consider whether further studies of this question would be desirable.35.     Second, the studies of senior NCO and Warrant Officer jobs that are described in Chapter 8 confirm that the present relativity between Sergeants&apos;and Corporals&apos; pay is about right, but suggest that there is a considerableoverlap in job sizes at all the ranks between Sergeant and Warrant Officer, andthat the differentials between pay bands should be increased in relation to thedifferentials between ranks.36.    To sum up:(i) the pay of new, entrants to the Services compares favourably withthat of their counterparts in civil life;(ii) the average earnings of the civilian comparator to the Corporalincreased by about 22 to 25 per cent between 1969 and 1971;
i confidential(iii) the earnings of civilians in jobs comparable in size to those ofofficers increased by about 16 to 19 per cent between 1969 and 1971;(iv) the relativities between the pay of senior NCO*s and warrant officers and that of junior officers should not be disturbed;(v) the present relativity between the pay of Corporals and Sergeantsis about right, but between Sergeant and Warrant Officer more emphasis should be placed on differentials between pay bands, and less ondifferentials between ranks.It is not practicable to take all these factors fully into account at present.An attempt to do so would require, for example, a reduction in pay or at bestlittle or no increase for the new entrant, coupled with an increase in pay forCorporals which would give a disproportionate reward to the progression fromrecruit to Corporal, and little further increase in pay for promotion betweenCorporal and Warrant Officer.The X Factor37*    We have mentioned in a previous chapter the considerations which gave rise to the X factor.   They were described more fully in the reports of the(1)NBPI      and we do not think it necessary to repeat them here.   The present level of 5 per cent for men was made subject to a limit of  200 a year, a limit which in 1970, cane into effect at the highest point of the pay scale of aLieutenant Colonel, but which would, as salaries are increased, take effect atprogressively lower levels.   we recommend that the upper limit should beincreased to  250 so as to restore the position to what it was in 1970.   the levels (of 5 per cent for men and 1 per cent for women) were fixed only twoyears ago and although.they&apos;were intended to be experimental, it is, as yet,too early to-recommend changes.   This is not to say that there have not beenchanges in the elements which comprise the X factor.   In the last two years the considerable increase in the level of civilian unemployment has made jobs in777 &quot;  .......&quot;&quot;&apos; Report No. 116, Crand 4079, June 1969 and No. l&apos;t2, Crand 4291, February 1970.

On theother hand, the degree of turbulence to which soldiers and, to a lesser extent,sailors and airmen are subject, has increased.   But v/e do not think that thebalance of disadvantage or advantage has changed significantly.38.    Talcing into account these often conflicting factors we have sought to devise pay structures which are compatible with each other and which, taking account of the increase of 7 per cent given in August, 1971. reasonably reflect the increases in civilian earnings which have taken place since the last review in 1970.   We recommend the introduction, with effect from 1st April, 1972, ofmilitary salaries based on the following illustrative tables:-

If these recommendations are accepted the Ministry of Defence will need towork out the new pay scales in detail.   Details &quot;&quot;of new Service pay scales are normally published as a White Paper; we suggest that on this occasion they shouldbe published as a supplement to this report.   We have made our recommendations interms of weekly or annual rates and ire recognise that the present pay system inthe Services will require them to be converted into daily rates.   We hope, however,that in due course the Services will   adopt a system that allows for weekly orannual salaries as is more usual in civil life.confilIIntial
CHAPTER 5THE WOMEN&apos;S SERVICES&apos; : - : ; : - . .- :hO.   There is, in parallel with each men&apos;s Service, a corresponding women&apos;service and Nursing Service, employing officers and non-commissioned ranks.Of these, the women&apos;s Services corresponding to the Royal Navy (WRNS andQARMS) are not subject to the same statutory requirements as men and arewomen&apos;s Services &quot;administered by the Defence Council&quot;.   The remainingServices - WRAP and FMRAFNS; and WRAC and QARANC; corresponding to the RoyalAir Force and Army respectively, are classed as Military and Air Forces ofthe Crown and are subject to the same statutes as the men&apos;s Services.kl.   Many roles in the Services are necessarily reserved for men because womendo not undertake combat duties.   Some are filled wholly, or almost wholly, by women.   But there is a considerable number filled by both men and women inwhich, in some cases, women are regarded by the Services as fully equivalentto, and inter-changeable with, mens for example, an   officer or NCO in thewomen&apos;s Services may be in charge of a number of men.   Before 1970, servioe-women&apos;s basic rates of pay were on average 85 per cent of the correspondingsingle men*s rates, but after talcing into account the free food and accommodation which both received, the value of women&apos;s total emoluments approximated to 90per cent of men&apos;s.h2.   The NBPI included some women&apos;s trades in its job evaluation studies andcame to the conclusion that in trades in which men and women were interchangeablev /&apos;   &quot;;&quot; .; &apos; /:-.----;r-&apos;   .&quot;&apos; &apos;;&apos; . ;.,  - : . &apos;: ., . :&apos;.:&quot;;V..the differences in size between their jobs were not great and were, in somecases, negligible.   It therefore recommended that women&apos;s trades should be allocated to the same pay^bands as had been adopted for the men&apos;s trades,......-        :-.(l) A three-band system was recommended in the WRNS, as in the other women&apos;services.   It would not have been appropriate to follow the system adopted for men in the Navy (para.16 above) since women in the WRNS do not go to sea.-   20   -
and that the Services should set themselves the objective of attaining equal pay by 1975.   (The Equal Pay Act, 1970 had not become law at the time theBoard reported).   The levels of pay which it attached to these bands were set at 90 per cent of the corresponding rates for men, excluding the X factor in both cases.   This did no more than preserve the relativity which had previous -iously existed.   The NBPI did not consider that the X-factor element in pay should necessarily be the same for men and for women:   conditions of engagementin the women&apos;s Services are, in practice, less onerous in some respects thanthose in the men&apos;s Services.   The X-factor element for men had for the timebeing been set at 5 per cent and the Board recommended that in the women&apos;services it should be a token 1 per cent; this should be reviewed if the X-factor for men were changed.Vj.   The effect of these recommendations, which were accepted by the Government,was that total pay rates in the women&apos;s Services became, on average,nearly 87per cent of the rates for men in the corresponding ranks and pay bands of themen&apos;s Services.kk.   Section 7 of the Equal Pay Act 1970 contains the following provisionsabout Service pay:&quot;The Secretary of State or Defence Council shall not make, orrecommend to Her Majesty the making of, any instrument relatingto the terms and conditions of servioe of members of the naval,military or air forces of the Crown or of any women1s serviceadministered by the Defence Council, if the instrument has theeffect of making a distinction, as&apos; regards pay, allowances orleave, between men and women who are members of those forces orof any such service, not being a distinction fairly attributable to differences between the obligations undertaken by men andthose undertaken by women as such members as aforesaid.&quot;if.  It will thus be necessary to ensure that when the work and conditions areequal, women receive equal pay with men by 29 December 1975* when the Act comes into force.   Differences may remain, however, if they are fairly attributable to different conditions, such as some of those covered by the X-factor, or to differences in committal or other factors where the women&apos;s and men&apos;s services are governed by different rules.   One difference is particularly significant;- 21 -
women can leave the Services (on marriage or for other reasons) much more easilythan men and in fact the majority leave after two years1 service or less.   Forthis reason women other ranks do not receive committal pay (i.e. their pay is calculated as a percentage of the men&apos;s Scale A) hut they receive length-of-service increments after 3 and 6 years, and bonuses are paid to those whocomplete initial engagements for 6 years.46.   As it is a percentage of servicemen&apos;s pay and thus related to the pay of civilian men whose jobs were used for the purposes of comparison, the pay ofthe women&apos;s Services is already high in relation to the pay that women ingeneral can at present earn outside.   We understand, too, that the job evaluationstudies carried out by the KBPI showed that some women&apos;s trades fall below thelower limit of the men&apos;s Band 1 trades; it would be difficult to justify thepayment to them of full Band 1 rates.   These differences, together with differences in conditions to which we have referred, need further examination.   For these reasons, while we think a step towards equal pay should be made, we propose that atthis stage   it should be a modest one.k&quot;].   We recommend that from 1 April 1972 the pay of the women&apos;s Services shouldbe increased to 90 per cent of the Scale A rates for men,   -As we do not recommendany change in the X-factor, this will mean that, excluding the X-factor in both cases, women&apos;s pay rates will be approximately 93i- per cent of the Scale A ratesfor men.^8.   If this recommendation is carried out and women&apos;s long service increments,to which we have referred above, are left unchanged, some women would receive more pay than men serving under similar conditions.   We do not think this can hejustified and accordingly recommend that at the same time as the general increasein women&apos;s pay their long service increments should be reduced from  1.47 to 1.19 a week after 3 years and that after 6 years, the amount already payable inthe YillAC and WRNS viz  2.59 a week should become standard.
- 23 -confidentialCHAPTER 6ADDITIONAL PAY AND SPECIAL PAY SCALES49.      We referred in Chapter 2 to a number of special pay scales whichdiffer from those relating to the majority of servicemen ; and to additional payments made to servicemen   in certain employments.   There are also allowancesthat servicemen   can claim in appropriate circumstances.   As they are toform an important part of our intended study we consider that for the present, mostforms of additional payment should continue at their present level.   Thereare, however, a few items that constitute a significant part of the totalearnings of the men or women concerned, and because of the fall in the valueof money since they were last reviewed it would be inequitable to postponeaction on them; it would, in addition, reduce their value as inducements toundertake demanding or hazardous work.   We therefore make recommendations inthis chapter on the items on which, in our view, some action is needed if only as an interim measure,    (it should not be inferred, however, that we believe the present level of any item on which no recommendation is made to be right;or that where we may now make a recommendation we commit ourselves to recommending the ever.tu?l continuance of that item of pay in its present form or at all.)50.      We shall deal first of all with committal pay and long service incrementsof pay, which, though not strictly items of additional pay are additions to the basic military salary intended as incentives to extended service, capable of separate consideration.   We then consider the more important items of additionalpay to which we referred generally in paragraph 49 viz flying pay; submarine pay;diving pay; hard lying money; v special service pay (hydrographic); and parachutepay.       Finally we turn to special pay scales, where for reasons unconnected with our projected study, our recommendations, apart from minimal changes willbe deferred.
Additions to the Basic Military SalaryCommittal Pay51,      Although committal pay, which we described in Chapter 2, is not expressed as a separate emolument it is, nevertheless, an addition to the basic militarysalary offered as a financial incentive to other ranks to commit themselves toserve for more than the minimum period.   The present rates of committal pay,which do not vary according to rank, are  1.47 a week (21p a day) to thosecommitted to serve for six but less than nine yeirs, and  3.78 a week (54p a day)to those eetnitted to serve for nine years or snore.   During the period of this review, the Ministry of Defence has given consideration to the alternative forms of incentive to 7rhich the National Board for Prices and Incomes referred(1)in its second report.,   &apos; These were:-(i)   Incremental pay for second.and subsequent engagements;(ii)   Cash payments at the end of service, graded by length of service;(iii)   Cash payments as inducements to re-engage - h system used to a smallextent in the Royal Navy;(iv)   An extension of (iii) to make such payments at the point of commitment to longer service.52.      The Ministry of Defence, after consideration, has expressed the viewthat for the time.being, committal pay should remain in its present form, and perhaps, in view of the forthcoming relaxation in the terms of engagements, aperiod of consolidation is advisable.   But as we have said, retention, i.e.prolongation of service, is becoming increasingly important, and we may need to reconsider alternative forms of incentive if the present methods prove to be inadequate.NBPI Report No. 11&apos;6 (Cmnd 4079) June 1969, Chapter 7.
confidential -  -53.      Because of the high cost of training and other disadvantages to the armed Forces which accrue from short service, it is important, within   thepresent system of committal payments, to offer adequate incentives to men to enlist for more than the minimum period of engagement and to extend their service as early as possible.   This will become all the more important with theintroduction, in May 1972, of the &quot;Notice Engagement&quot; which will allow servicemenon completion of training and after ijz years productive service, to give18 months&apos; notice of leaving.    We consider that there should be a substantial increase in this form of incentive and to this end recommend that committal pay should be increased to: 1.82 a week (26p a day) for committal to a minimum of 6 but less than 9years&apos; service; and 4.55 a week (65p a day) for committal to 9 or more years&apos; service.Length of Service Increments..of Pay &apos;54.      Length of service increments of pay (LSP) provide additional rewardsfor service in excess of nine years and are intended to provide an incentivefor men the Services wish to rets.In, to prolong their engagements beyond the nineyear point.   In the past, each service has operated a different pattern ofLSP, based on its own engagement structure but the Ministry of Defence has now asked us to consider a new pattern of payments which has been devised with the&quot;Notice Engagement&quot; in mind.(l)   The new pattern, which is set out in the tableon the next page, provides for more frequent, but in certain cases smaller,incrementsin the Navy and RAP in line with the practice in the Array, and though notintroducing a uniform system, goes a long way towards standardisation.   Merecommend that it should be adopted.55.      Although the implementation of this recommendation involves in somecases the payment of smaller increments than those payable under current scales,for servicemen   newly qualifying for LSP, these reductions are offset byThe right to 1save the Services at 18 months&apos; notice will, under the new system, be extended automatically to all men and women who have served for9 years or more.
confidentialprovision for earlier payment.   For those already in receipt of LSP at rates which, they had no reason to doubt, would continue for the period of theiicurrent engagements we believe that, exceptionally, full protection should boafforded.   He reoommendthat where the existing rate of L3P is more favourable than that now recommended, it should be retained for the duration of theserviceman&apos;s current engagement.Table  3Length of service increments of payWeekly rates after completing the following years1 service	9	12    ,	15	16	18	22	 	 	 	 	 	     &apos;10YAL NAVY/ROYAL MARINES						ible Seaman, Marine I Leading Seaman, Corporal KM	1.40	2.10	-	-	-	-Petty Officer, Sergeant RM	2.10	2.45	-	3.85	-	-Jhief Petty Officer, Colour Sgt RM	2.10	3.50	-	4.20	-	-Quartermaster Sergeant, RM	2.10	3.5b	-	4.55	-	5.60PCPO/RSM, RM	2.10	3.50	-	4.55	-	5.95ARMY						Private, Lance Corporal	1.40	2.10	-	-	-	Corporal	1.40	2.10	2.45	-	-	-Sergeant	1.75	2.45	3.15	-	3.85	-Staff Sergeant	1.75	2.45	3.15	-	4.20	-Warrant Officer, Class II	1.75	2.45	3.15		4.20	4.90Warrant Officer, Class I	1.75	2.45	3.15	-	4.20	5.95ROYAL AIR FORCE						Leading Aircraftman, Senior Aircraftmen and Junior Technician	1.40	2.10	-		-	-Corporal                                    v	1.40	2.10	2.45	-	-.	-Sergeant	1.75	2.45	3.15	-	3.85	- &apos;    ,. jChief Technician, Flight Sergeant	1.75	2.45	3.15		4.20	-Warrant Officer	1.75	2.45	3.15	-	4.20	5.95
Additional Pay56.      In the following paragraphs we make recommendations on increases inthe forms of additional pay which in our view constitute a significant part oftotal earnings and which, with one exception, have not been increased for twoyears or ;more.   We consider that, pending a more complete review, they should beincreased by approximately the same percentage as the increase in military salariessince April, 1970. .   We do not think it necessary that the adjustment should beexact and accordingly our recommendations are based on levels of additionalpay 18 per cent higher than those current in April 1970.   Because, at thesame time, we propose certain structural changes, or other considerations apply, this increase cannot be applied 1 across the board1 to existing&apos; rates andwe therefore set out our recommendations in detail.Plying Pay57.      Plying pay for specialist aircrew was increased by 7 per cent in August1971, so that in their case only, the further increase on this occasion will be slightly less than 11 per cent.   With this exception, our general recommendation is appropriate to the rates of flying pay, flying instructional pay and crewpay.Submarine Pay58.      We consider that on this occasion the &quot;tanering&quot; which occurred inconsequence of the flat rate increase in the rates of submarine pay awarded toall ranks in 1970 should now be reversed by giving rather larger percentage increases to the higher ranks than to the lower./ We recommend accordingly thatthe rates of submarine pay should be:-- 27 -
Table 4Submarine PayRank	Annual rate	Daily rate	 	( )Lieutenant and above, and SD officers of any rank(l)	511	1.40Sub. Lt., PCPO and cp	474.50	1.30PO	394.20	1.08Midshipman, Ldg Rating and below	357.70	0.98Diving Pay59.      Diving Pay includes a number of different types of payment made to diversin the Royal Navy, Royal Marines   and Army.   The first, Special Service Pay(living) (SSP(d)) is a continuous daily rate which bears a general relationship to the intensity of diving carried out by each category of diver,   tfe recommendSwimmerthat with the exception of one category of diver - the Royal Marine/Canoeist -the new rates should be based on the principle expressed in paragraph 56. Thiswill preserve the existing relationship which appears to be satisfactory. Therates for Royal Marine Swimmer Canoeists were fixed when they were regarded asshallow water divers. Taking account of recent changes in their training and duties which the Ministry of Defence have brought to our notice, we recommendthat from April, 1972 the rates should be as follows:-Table 5Diving pay; rates for Royal Marine Swimmer canoeistsTypeSwimmer Canoeistofficer vSwimmer 1st ClassSwimmer 2nd Class.Swimmer 3*d ClassDaily rate 0.700.700.480.40(l)   Sub-Lieutenants (SD) in the submarine service are invariably ex-ratingsub-mariners -and are employable as part crew without further training.   Assuch they merit the rate of submarine pay paid to Lieutenants and above, andwe recommend that this rate should be payable to all sd officers in the submarineservice.
CONFIDENTIAL60.      The second type of payment, Dip Money, is paid only to divers whoundertake specially hazardous or experimental work.   It is not paid concurrently with SSP(d).   We do not propose any general increase in the rates payable butwe note that there is no provision for the payment of &quot;Dip Money&quot; to Experi-inental Divers for dives to depths of less than 250 feet.   We consider that fordivers who sometimes have to dive to depths between 181 and 250 feet, breathingcompressed air, a payment is desirable and we recommend that it should be ata rate of  O.O36 (3-6p) a minute for dives in this range of depths.61.      Finally, we consider the payments made to Submarine Escape TrainingTank (SETT) Instructors whose task is to train officers and ratings to escape from and to re-enter submarines.   These payments are based on &quot;Dip Money&quot; principles and we recommend that in the case of ratings only, they should be increased from 0.8p to 1.0 p a minute.Hard Lying Money62.      This is at present paid (at a rate of 13p a day) to all ranks when serving in ships where the living conditions are especially arduous.   It has beensuggested that it should be extended, to all ships so as to recognise all the disadvantages of life at sea but should be paid at a higher rate for service inthe ships where conditions are worst.   We do not feel able to accept thissuggestion until we have given it further consideration in relation to thefinancial alleviations (in the way of remissions of food and accommodationcharges and the payment of separation allowance) that are already provided for service on board ship or in the field.   In the meanwhile, however, we recommendthat the rate of hard lying money should be increased to  1.05 a week (l5p aday) so as to restore, approximately the relation to basic pay that it hadin April 1970.Special Service Pay (Hydrographic)63.      SSP (llydrographic) is paid on a continuous basis to qualified officersand ratings in the ^ Surveying Service at rates varying between  0.70 and
CONFIDENTIAL 5,60 a week (lOp and 30p a day).   Members of a survey ships crew who do not qualify for SSP (Hydrographic) receive Hard Lying Money.   We recommend that thenew rates should be based on the general principle expressed in paragraph 56but that exceptionally the lowest rate - which is payable to the SurveyingRecorder (Star) - should be the same as the new rate of Hard Lying Money viz 1.05 a week (l5p a day).Parachute Pay and Parachute Jumping Instructors&apos; Pay64.      We recommend that these payments, which do not vary with rank, should beincreased to:-Parachute Pay  3.08 a week (44p a day)Parachute Jumping Instructors1 Pay    3.57 a week (51p a day)65.      Finally, we turn to special pay scales.Special Pay ScalesMedical and Dental Officers66.      The pay of doctors and dentists in the Armed Forces is not directly related to the pay of combatant officers but is designed to provide, beforeaddition of the X-factor, average earnings over a career extending from Captainto Colonel equal to the average net earnings of civilian general practitionersin the National Health Service.   The pay of medical and dental Brigadiers is determined at a level which provides a reasonable increment over the maximum pay of Colonels and a logical progression to the higher ranks.   Thus, the principalfactors governing changes in the pay of Service medical and dental officers are the recommendations of the Review Body on doctors and Dentists&apos; Remuneration.67.      The provision of medical dental and nursing services to the Armed Forces isat present being reviewed by a Committee appointed by the Secretary of State for defence, and pending the report of this Committee we think the present link withthe pay of NHS practitioners should be continued.   We understand that the review body on Doctors&apos; and dentists Remuneration is likely to make a report about
confidential the rates of pay to apply from April 1972 shortly after our present report is completed.   V/e therefore make no recommendations about the pay of medical and dental officers and cadets in this report, but expect the Ministry of defence to consult us when the new rates of remuneration for civilian doctors are determined.Young Entrants68.      The pay of apprentices, juniors and young soldiers is at present acomplex of ten scales and the Ministry of Defence has put forward proposalsfor their simplification.   We believe that simplification is both desirable and possible, but have had insufficient time to give these proposals theconsideration which would enable us to make recommendations in this report.We suggest that in the meantime the rates of pay of young entrants should beincreased by the amount required to cover the increases which we recommendin the charges for food and accommodation.Other Special Scales^9. Certain officers (eg Legal and Veterinary Officers and Quarter-masters) have special pay scales related (by means of a specific &quot;pay lead&quot;in cash terms, or in other ways) to the general pay scales for officers.   Inthese cases we recommend that the present links with and the leads over combatantpay should be maintained pending a later review.
CHAPTER 7CHARGES FOR FOOD AND ACCOMMODATIONFood Charges70.   Until April 1970, servicemen^ meals were provided free;   if, however,they were not on the ration strength of their units, for example becausethey were married men living out of barracks, or because they were on leave for more than 48 hours, they received a ration allowance in lieu of the freefood.   The basis of the allowance was the retail value of the daily ration,increased by 20 per cent to allow for the extra cost of individual purchases.   Afurther addition (of 8 old pence a day) was made to cover the cost of preparation of the food.   In order to avoid the need constantly to recalculatethe basic cost of the ration, the rate of ration allowance was adjustedannually to 1 December by reference to a formula based on the food element in the Retail Price Index.71.   Since the introduction of the military salary in April 1970, singleservicemen have been required to pay for their food while they are on the ration strength.   But they do not pay if they are living out, or are on leave for more than 48 hours.   The charges are also remitted when men are servingat sea or in the field for two nights or more.72,   The NBPI recommended that when food was provided by the Services it shouldbe charged for at a rate comparable wroh that paid by a civilian, and that thecharge should be calculated by the same formula as had been used for calculating the ration allowance.   The resulting charge was to be reduced by 10 per cent to take account of absences of less than 48 hours when, although not takingmeals, a man continued to be charged for them.   At that time (1970/71) the daily food charge calculated in this way was the equivalent of  2.52 a week(36p a day) ie a daily ration allowance of 40p less 10 per cent.   On 1 August-32-confidential
1971 the charge was increased to  2.73 a week (39p a day), that is by8.3 per cent.73.   The method used for abating the food charge for absences is not whollysatisfactory and the total cost of providing servicemen&apos;s meals has recentlybeen studied closely by the Ministry of Defence and Civil Service Department.As would be expected, the total cost, including the cost of premises andequipment, and the salaries of cooks, etc, exceeds the retail value of the rations by a considerable margin.   Indeed, the total cost approximated, atthe time of the study, to a daily average of 70p a head.   The charge paidby the serviceman exceeds the bare cost of the food he eats but makes littlecontribution to the cost of overheads.   V/e have, therefore, been asked to review the basis of the charge.   In doing so, we shall take account ofexperiments with a &quot;pay as you dine&quot; system conducted by the Services in1970/71 under which servicemen would pay only for the meals they ate.74.   This review cannot be carried out before 1 April 1972, the date on which our general recommendations are intended to become operative.   Meanwhile werecommend that the food charge from 1 April 1972 should be calculated onthe existing basis *and should be  2.94 a week (42p a day).Accommodation Charges75.  Accommodation, like food, was in principle provided free until April 1970.Married men received a marriage allowance but had to pay either a charge for public married quarters or the rent of private accommodation.   The charge for public married quarters was below the general level of rents in civil life, thedifference being intended partly as compensation for the frequent moves thatoccur in Service life and also because the marriage allowance paid before1 April 1970 was rarely increased.   Married men for whom the Services were unable to provide married quarters received a higher rate of marriage allowance.
76.   Since the introduction of the military salary the policy of the Serviceshas been to bring charges for accommodation into line with the amounts a civilian would have to pay in similar circumstances.   The proposal putforward by the NBPI, which was accepted by the Government, was that rentsfor other ranks1 married quarters should be based on the average rents charged for Local Authority houses of similar standards.   To these rents would be addedcharges in lieu of rates;   charges for the furniture provided by the Services;and the cost of maintenance and decoration which the Services undertake, tothe extent that this is more than is generally carried out by Local Authori-ties.   It was originally intended that the rents for officers&apos; married quarters should be so calculated as to put them in a comparable position to civilians who were buying houses on mortgage, but this proved to be impracticablInstead, officers&apos; married quarters rents were calculated in a similar way(allowing for differences in the standard of accommodation) to those of other ranks.77.  The rents calculated by the NBPI and set out in their Report ofFebruary 1970 were based on the average of   Local Authority rents in April1968, since this was the latest information then available.   Even so, they represented very&apos;big increases on the rents that had been charged hithertoand the Board recommended, following the policy which the Government had applied by statute to Local Authorities, that the new rents should be intro-duced in stages (except for the smallest - Type A - quarters).   The first stage of the increase was applied in April 1970 and was intended to apply untilthe next review which was then expected to be in April 1972.   The NBPI hoped to bring Service and civilian rents into line at that time in relation to thelatest information which would be obtainable.   In the event, the government decided that rents should be increased by 7 per cent in August 1971 at thesame time as the interim increase in military salaries.- 34 -
- 35 -78.   Using the mo3t recent statistics of the Institute of MunicipalTreasurers and Accountants - those for April 1971 - together with newlycalculated figures for rates, furniture and additional maintenance, we havemade an assessment of new levels of accommodation charges which, if adopted,would represent large increases - ranging from 18 to 38 per cent over presentcharges, and smaller, though still substantial increases over the unstagedlevel of charges considered appropriate in 1970.   That they should be so highis not unexpected as they would encompass the remaining element of stagedcharges not already accounted for by the increase which was implemented inAugust 1971. and in addition, reflect increases in local authority rentsover the period from April 1968 to April 1971.   In our view, the introductionof such large increases in April 1972 might cause hardship in some instanceswhich would not be alleviated in present circumstances by any scheme forrent rebates.79.   Military salaries are based on the principle that servicemen&apos;s pay andthe charges they have to meet are fair in relation to the pay received andthe corresponding expenses borne by civilians.   It is important that this principle should be maintained.   We are not convinced, however, that it isaltogether fair to compare the rents for married quarters with the rents oflocal authority houses in the way that has been attempted so far.   A largeproportion of servicemen have married quarters or hirings provided for them andtheir families during most of their service, whereas in other occupations the employer does not generally provide housing for his workers.   But servicemerhave to find their own accommodation when they leave the Services.   If they wish to buy their own houses they may be at a disadvantage, in a time of rising house prices, compared with civilians who start buying their housesearlier in their careers.   Y/e wish to consider this question further and mean-while recommend that the accommodation charges to be introduced in April 1972
should be calculated by the addition of 12-^ per cent to the unstaged ratesrecommended by the NBPI in 1970.   On this basis, the charges will be:-Table 6Officers and other ranks married quartersExisting and proposed chargesType of Quarter	Existing Annual Charge	Proposed Charge			Annual	DailyOther ranks	 	 	 A	120.12	135.05	0.37B	171.08	204.40	O.56C	189.28	237.25	O.65B/W.0	211.12	273.75	0.75Officers			V (1)	281.05	324.85	0.89IV (1)	324.85	375.95	1.03III (l)	354.05	423.40	1.16II (1)	412.45	478.15	1.311(1).-	456.25	532.90	I.46(l)   including garage charges of  25.55 a year,80, Following the general policy of requiring servicemen to pay chargessimilar to those civilians have to meet, single servicemen when provided with accommodation in barracks or messes (but not when serving at sea orin the field) are charged a rent intended to cover the space used for sleeping,eating and living space, with small elements for heat, light and service.   Thecharges are calculated as a proportion of the rente of married quarters; for
officers, half the rent of the married quarter excluding garage charge, towhich they would be entitled if married: for junior other ranks one quarter,and for Senior NCOs one half, of the rent of a Type C married quarter.   charges for heat and light are added in each case.   These charges were introduced infull in April 1970* based on the calculated rents for married quarters withoutstaging.   They were not increased in August 1971 and we think that on this occasion the new charges which we recommend should again be based on the fullcalculation.of charges and should be introduced in full.   They are:-Table 7Charges for single quartersRank	Existing Annual	Proposed Charge		Charge	Annual	DailyStandard Accommodation	 		 Corporal and below *	58.24	69.35	0.19WO and snco	113.88	135.05	0.37Captain and below/	145.20	171.55	0.47Major	177.96	208.05	0.57Lieutenant Colonel and above	198.96	233.60	O.64Senior Officers occupying single rooms			Major	155.88	182.50	0.50Lieutenant Colonel and above	177.12	208.05	0.5781. There should be no change in the the basis of calculation of charges for sub-standard married and single accommodation.
82.   The increases we recommend are, nevertheless, large and may causehardship in some cases, e.g. junior ranks who by virtue of family size occupya large and correspondingly expensive quarter.   We recommend that when suchcases are identified, they should be dealt with by administrative action.As a wholly exceptional measure, we recommend that in the case of SecondLieutenants and equivalent ranks serving on 31 March 1972, the existing rates of accommodation charge should continue until we next review them.- 33 -
CHAPTER 8JOB EVALUATION OF SENIOR NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS AND WARRANT OFFICERS83.     The need for further job evaluation studies at the level of Sergeant and above was foreshadowed in the NBPI Report No 1^2, Chapter 2 and theBoard and the Ministry of Defence initiated these studies in June 1970.   TheMinistry of Defence and OME continued them, after the Board had been abolished,and they were well advanced by the time we were appointed.8k,     A detailed account of the background to these studies, the methodsadopted and the results is given in Appendix 2.   The results tend, on thewhole, to confirm the allocations to pay bands made in 1970.   Indeed, between80 and 90 per cent of the trades at these higher levels have been confirmed intheir present bands.   But in the remaining instances a pay band higher or lower than the present one has been shown to be appropriate at one or more ranks incertain trades.   On promotion, therefore, men in these trades ought to move into different bands from those that were appropriate at the lower rank andthis may in certain instances, give rise to difficulties.   To understand these difficulties it is necessary,briefly, to examine some of the implications ofjob evaluation for the salary structure.85.     It has been suggested to us that the system of job evaluation which hasbeen employed at the ranks of Sergeant and above is, because of its emphasis on managerial requirements, inadequate for the measurement of jobs which arenot managerial in character, and may thus be at the root of the problems whichhave emerged.   But a non-managerial job is unlikely to cEorry as much weight as one which is managerial so long as the jobs of senior NCOs and Warrant officers are deemed by the services to be, in general, managerial in character.   It was,in fact, these managerial characteristics which the system was designed to measure.   We do not therefore subscribe to the view that it is necessary to devise new job evaluation systems for the solution of the problems that have arisen.
CONFIDENTIAL36.    The studies demonstrate a large overlap in job sizes between ranks.Thus, although, for example, the average Sergeant has a smaller job than theaverage Staff Sergeant, who in turn has a smaller job than the average warrant officer, some Sergeants are doing bigger jobs than some Staff Sergeants, and indeed than some Warrant Officers.   There are extreme cases in which the jobsize in a trade is substantially the same at all ranks from Sergeant to warrant officer Class I, and it will be apparent that a job which at the rank ofSergeant may be highly skilled or responsible in relation to other Sergeantsmay well be a good deal less so in relation to Warrant Officers.Implications for pay87.    Rank in the Armed Forces is awarded for a number of reasons of which anincrease in job size is not always the most important.   The overlap to which wehave referred is not, therefore, unexpected and is in fact reflected to someextent in the existing pay structure.   Thus a Sergeant in Band 3 earns morethan a Staff Sergeant in Band 2 or a Warrant Officer Class II in Band 1.   the studies now completed suggest that above the rank of Sergeant the differences in job size between pay bands (which should be reflected in pay if job evaluation results are to be applied consistently) are&apos; even more important inrelation to the differences between ranks than was previously supposed but wewere not able, in framing our recommendations on the pay of other ranks, togive this evidence the weight which we think it should have.in the longer term.88.     It appears, however, that the present relationship between Corporals andSergeants is about right.   We made a subsidiary study of Service trades at the rank of Sergeant using the same factor plan as had been used by the NBPI at the rank of Corporal.   This system places the main emphasis on physical and mentalrather than managerial skills and may not therefore fully reflect themanagerial elements in the Sergeant *s job.   But it gave results whichcorresponded closely to those obtained under the &quot;management&quot; factor plan to- kO -
CONFIDENTIALwhich we have referred and we conclude that at the rank of Sergeant the differences between the two systems are not very material.   On the whole,Sergeants in Band 1 and Band 2 trades were found to have jobs equivalent tothose of Corporals in Bands 2 and 3 respectively and we conclude that aSergeant in Band 1 should be paid about the same as a Corporal in Band 2; anda Sergeant in Band 2 should be paid about the same as a Corporal in Band 3*This is, approximately, the present relationship.89.    The pay structure we have recommended in Chapter k illustrates thedifficulties which the full implementation of the job evaluation results wouldinvolve.   An upward change, or retention of the same band on promotion would present no difficulty,but a downward change in hand would impose, in general,a reduction in pay; or at best, between Corporal and Sergeant, a.very small increase.   Understandably, the Services would find such downward changesunacceptable if they had such pay consequences.   For the time being, therefore,the results of the present studies have been held in abeyance; that is, therewill be no changes from the present pay bands until the Services have had timeto consider the implications of the studies and the courses of action which are open to them.90.    We can appreciate the reasons why the Armed Forces management needed to postpone action.   Clearly, a change in pay band involving an actual reductionin pay would be impracticable.   But the technique of job evaluation which the armed Forces have adopted did not create a set of relativities to last for alltime.   As in any industry, techniques and equipment are constantly changing,and with them, organisations and the relative importance of jobs , Accordingly,as job evaluation is recognised to be a continuing process, it must be accepted that from time to time jpbs, or even whole trades, may change in value andmove up, or down, in band.   The remedy for the latter is to seek the positive sol-contributions which might make such action unnecessary.   It would be premature to state with- 4l -
CONFIDENTIALcertainty what these may be, but we suggest that as a first step, the study of alternative rank structures to fit the 30b sizes required in the trades concerned would be of value; or perhaps the determination of a pay band which represents a fair average for all ranks in a trade.   Again, the re-definition of the requirements of a trade at each rank, coupled iriLth job enlargement and/or the elimination of some ranks might provide a solution in certain cases.91.     V/ithin the job evaluation systems which have formed the basis of extensive studies carried out so thoroughly, on behalf of the Services, the nbpi and ourselves, by the Joint Services Job Evaluation Team, we see noreason why a way should not be found out of the difficulties we have described.We accordingly recommend that the Services management should examine theproblem areas and put forward detailed proposals with the aim of resolving thedifficulties by, at the latest, 1974.   If this is to be achieved, we would hope to be able to discuss these proposals with the Services during the presentyear.   It seems likely that one reason for the seeming intractability of someof the difficulties is that servicemen have not been fully prepared for them.We therefore recommend that the job evaluation systems used by the Services,their implications for servicemen,and even the difficulties to which their usemay give rise should be given the widest possible publicity in Service units.- 42 -
- 43 -CHAPTER 9CONCLUSIONS92.     Service pay was last reviewed in April, 1970.   Our present proposals on military salaries will mean that, taking into account the 7 per centinterim increase awarded by the Government in August, 1971, it will haveincreased at an average annual rate of about 9 per cent compound, that isby a total of about 18-jt per cent ,or slightly more than the average increasein prices,over the two years since the previous review.   The effect on thetotal of Service pay, additional pay and allov/ances is slightly less than thissince the changes in additional pay and allowances which we recommended in chapter 6 do not apply to all the items that go to make up the total.   The newpay scales v/e have recommended in paragraph 37 (Chapter k) would increase the currentpay of individual servicemen by amounts ranging from as little as 2 per cent toabout 14 per cent.   For women, because a step towards equal pay has been proposed, the increases are somewhat higher; the recommendations in paragraphsV? and 48 (Chapter 5) represent increases ranging from 5 to 16 per cent.Taking the men&apos;s and women&apos;s Services together, the average increases in payare about 10 per cent for officers and, including committal pay and length ofservice increments of pay, about 11 per cent for other ranks.93*     In Chapter 7 we have recommended increases in charges which are estimated to represent an increase of  7*8m (about 15 per cent) in the total amountservicemen pay for food and accommodation.   We intend to review the basis onwhich these charges are calculated, having in mind particularly the need to besure that the charges are fair in relation to the costs borne by civilians andto the special circumstances of service men and women.   In this connection weshall need to consider the implications for the Services of Government policy towards local authority housing and the proposed introduction of a generalscheme for rent rebates.
CONFIDENTIAL94,    In arriving at our recommendations we have kept in mind that the national interest requires the Armed Forces to be kept up to the strength deemed necessary by the Government and to be manned by men and women who feel theyare being treated fairly in relation to their civilian counterparts.   We havealso kept in mind the Government s anxiety, in the national interest, to bringabout a reduction in the rate of increase in money incomes.   In doing so wehave soupht to achieve a reasonable balance between these two factors.95.     If civilian earnings continue to increase in the period after April 1972the pay of the Services will begin to fall behind again.   This is unavoidablewhen pay is determined by comparisons with other earnings, as it is not only for the Services but for many other groups as well.   Such a situation can onlybe acceptable if the period between reviews is not too long and the rate of increase in the earnings of the groups used for comparison is not too great.We have taken note of the Government&apos;s view that Services&apos; pay should normally be reviewed at two-yearly intervals but so long as civilian earnings are increasing as rapidly as they are, there might be a serious injustice ifService pay were left unchanged for a period as long as two years.   Accordinglywe shall keep Service pay under continuing review and shall feel free to putforward recommendations on particular aspects of the subject when we believethem to be necessary.- 44 -

JOB- EVALUATIONSenior NCO/Warrant Officer StudyIntroduction1.   The job evaluation studies of other ranks carried cut in 1969 by a JointServices Job Evaluation team on behalf of the NBPI and described in its ReportNo 142: Chapter 2 and Appendix 6, were carried out mainly at the rank ofCorporal.   Some studies were made of senior ranks at Sergeant and StaffSergeant level but these did not produce an entirely consistent relation-ship with junior ranks and it was concluded that the system employed, whichwas devised with the Corporal level in mind, was not adequate to deal withthe management elements in many jobs at the higher rank levels.   There was insufficient time for a further detailed study of the higher rank levels and accordingly similar bandings to those proposed at the Corporal level were0)recommended.   Certain trades      exist only above Corporal level.   Navyartificers and   mechanicians, which in effect exist mainly at Petty officer and Chief Petty Officer level, had previously been paid rates comparable withtechnicians and other trades in the Army and RAP which were allocated to Band 3.Such examinations as were made of the rank of these naval technicians confirmedthis link and the NBPI recommended that they should be paid in Band 3 whenqualified.   In the other services they proposed in general that trades which existed only above Corporal level should maintain their existing relativepositions.2.   The NBPI recommended (Report No 142 para 17) that the problems ofevaluation at the level of Sergeant and above should be further studied tosee whether a satisfactory system could be developed capable of handling themore managerial skills required in these ranks.(1)The word &quot;trade&quot; is used to refer to different kinds of work in theservices.   These are not necessarily trades as the word is used in civil life.-46-
confidential.   This recommendation was accepted by the Ministry of Defence.   A feasibilitystudy was carried out under the supervision of NBPI staff and of consultantsretained by them.   The conclusion reached was that the system developed wasworkable and should, with minor amendments, be used for a main study.Certain problems had come to light and it was apparent that under a factor(1)plan designed to assess managerial skills   &apos;   certain trades which at SeniorNCO and Warrant Officer level were substantially operative (ie used skillsof hand and eye) would compare adversely with trades where the main skills weremanagerial.   However, the Services considered that rank was primarily avardedfor managerial skills and this was therefore the appropriate criterion.The joint services job evaluation team4.   The ad-hoc team which had carried out the studies in 1969 was reconstitutedin June 1970 to carry out the feasibility study.   It continued in being tocarry out the main study.   Several of the original staff were made availableso that there was some continuity in the work.   The team was put on apermanent footing from 1 September 1971*   As in 1969 it consisted of service officers, Warrant Officers and Senior NCOs with the addition from time to timeof members of the NBPI&apos;s (later 0MS&apos;s) Enquiry Team.   New members of the teamwere trained by the consultants and other team members in interviewingtechniques and the writing of job descriptions, so as to maintain thecontinuity which is of such importance in this work.Judging Panel5.   A judging panel was set up consisting of an officer of Colonel rank from each Service with a consultant as chairman and a member of the NBPI (laterOME) staff as observer.   A member of the staff of the Civil Service Depart-ment also acted as occasional observer.   The judges were as in 1969 so chosend)&apos; The term &quot;managerial skills&quot; is used to cover planning, motivation, super-vision, checking and accountability.- 47 -
as to reflect the preponderance of skills in their Services and as far aspossible to produce a balance between the combat, engineering and technicalskills exercised by the ranks/trades under study.   Two of the judges had served on the judging panel for the 1969 study and their expertise and thecontinuity provided were of great value in what proved to be a much moredifficult exercise.The Factor Plan6.   Following discussion between the Ministry of Defence and the NBPI andwith the advice of the consultants a factor plan was devised for the feasibilitystudy which:a) related to all or most of the Senior NCO/Warrant Officertrades in all services;b) differentiated between their jobs 5c) enabled the essential and distinctive elements of those jobsto be described.The factors defined, detailed in paragraph 8 below, also took account of thosemanagement skills associated with planning, supervision, checking and account a-bility which were a significant aspect of the Senior NCO&apos;s and warrant officer&apos;s roles.7.   Consideration was given to the weightings to be attached to each factor.It was agreed that:-a)   Previous training and experience was&quot; relatively less importantat Senior NCO/Warrant Officer levels than at the Corporal level.   Thiswas because a man&apos;s training had usually been completed by the time hebecame a Senior NCO and he was generally employed more as a manager.orsupervisor than as an exponent of his particular trade skills.- 48 -
b) The factors which in combination represented &apos;command skills&apos;ie freedom of action and responsibility for supervision taken togetherwere more important than previous training and experience.c) Working environment was a relatively less important factor thanat Corporal level.Various factor weightings were tested during the feasibility study.   Weightingswhich produced a credible order of jobs while taking into account the values of the Armed Forces and which could confidently be expected to measure thesuccess or otherwise of the way in which job requirements fitted into the rank structure, were adopted for the main study.   They are shown against the factors in paragraph 8 below.   It was apparent that at the ranks of Sergeantand Chief Technician (RAF) there was some ambiguity as to whether their rolewas primarily managerial or skill orientated and it was therefore decided thatthe trades exercised at that level would be judged also against the skill-orientated factor plan previously used to evaluate the jobs of Corporals.8.

Benchmarks9.   As a preliminary to the judging process the Services were invited to nominate benchmark jobs which in their opinion typified each level of the seven factors.   The term &quot;benchmark&quot; was used to indicate a practicalexample of a specific case; for example the Warrant Officer Class I ArtificerSergeant Major (Telecommunications) REME was selected as an example of a high level of training and experience.10.   Examples of jobs chosen as benchmarks were studied by the judging paneland were either used, at the intended, or another level, or discarded.   those used were awarded points.   The inspection of benchmark jobs which took twomonths performed two functions.   It enabled the judges to supplement their experience of one Service and become familiar with a wide range of jobs in each service in the field.   Also , in reaching agreement on the level of activities and the points to be awarded to each benchmark job they had an opportunityto resolve differences of opinion and approach and develop common standards ofjudging before the main exercise started.Selection of Tasks and Trades for Study11.   The criteria adopted for selection of rank/trades for full evaluationwere that:-a) attention should be concentrated on the most populous trades;b) there should be as full a cover as possible of the spread of jobs in terms of job size in each rank;c) sufficient cover should be provided bpth by trade mid rank withina trade to facilitate the allocation to pay bands of rank/trades not fully evaluated;       vd) only established posts should be evaluated;- 50 -
e) tradesmen employed in jobs outside their trade eg seamen on gatesecurity duties ashore or infantrymen employed at the MOD should notbe investigated.275 rani&apos;, /trades including 14 women&apos;s rank/trades were fully investigated and evaluated.Preparation of job descriptions12.   During the feasibility study it was found that due to the complexity of the jobs under study and also the great diversity of employment within any rank/trade it was extremely difficult to integrate observations of anumber of jobs into a composite description for any particular rank/trade.Consequently, for the main study it was decided that composite descrip-tions would be replaced by separate job descriptions for sufficient jobswithin each rank/trade to ensure that there was coverage of the typicalrange of employments.   The three Services Were asked to provide informationas to the deployment of personnel within each rank/trade and to advise onthe selection of typical jobs for study.   They were also asked to providea brief note of untypical employments so that their effect on overall jobsize could be considered during the evaluation process.Judging process13.   The process of awarding points to rank/trades was very similar to thatoperating in the Corporal study.   One difference was the requirement to judgeindividual job descriptions as opposed to composite rank/trade descriptions.This considerably reduced the onus placed on judges of interpreting the tasks of the rank/trades in their own services.14*   The system of checks and balances operating during the judging processwere:-- 51 -
confidential(i) A unanimous decision was required for each score under each factor.(ii) Individual judges were required to accept reponsibility fortheir collective decisions outside the judging panel, but weredebarred from discussing individual scores.(iii) iach Service judge was, in effect, always in a minority so thatno Service could attempt, consciously or unconsciously, to gain special treatment for one of its jobs.(iv) Factor scores were subject to regularmtionalisation to ensureappropriate relativities were created and maintained.(v) Total scores were not calculated until the end of the judging.This avoided preconceptions about whole-job relativities affectingjudgements of factors.(vi) Where the judges could not reach agreement the chairman had theauthority to withdraw the rank/trade in question.These rules protected the integrity of the system and enabled the judges to judge all. the jobs as objectively as&apos;-possible.   Each judge had to ensure that,within those bounds, the results were sensible and acceptable within the distinctive culture of his own Service,.but he was not primarily an advocateor protagonist of his own Service&apos;3 interests.ttesulbs15.   The points scores resulting from the judging process showed that:-?(i) There was a broad points range at each rank level which fully justified at least three pay bands. Table 1 shows the maximum and minimum scores and the range of points for each rank.-  - 52 -       -
Table    1Hank	Minimum Score	iMaximum Score	RangeSergeant	160	515	355Chief Technician (RAP only)	274	660	386Staff Sergeant	200	716	516Warrant Officer Class II (including Chief Artifi-cer/lfecharician RN)	279	753	474Warrant Officer Class I	315	822	507(ii)   There was a very considerable points overlap between eachrank and every other rank.   Whilst both minimum and maximum scorestended to increase with rank there was no clear relationship betweenrani: and job size.   Within each trade however there was generally a positive relationship between rank and job size.   There were onlysix trades in which the total points score for one rank was lens thanthat of a lower rank.   There were a further sixteen instances of thescore of .one rank being less than ten per cent more than the score ofa lower rank in the same trade.Pay banding16.   In the absence of any clear relationship between rank and job sizea pay banding system based on job 3ize could only be obtained by adoptingof two broad methods ie /(i)   dividing the total points scored for all Senior NCO/warrant officer ranks into bands and paying all. ranks according to job size(perhaps with a small rank increment);
confidential(ii)   grading&apos; bands so that as rank increased a bigger job sizewas generally required.Implications of the first alternative would require extensive study whichcould not have been completed in time for the current pay review.   It wastherefore decided to proceed with the study on the basis of the second alternative.17.   In considering the number of pay bands there should be at the SeniorNCO and Warrant Officer levels it was borne in mind that the existing threeband system was less than two years old, was generally accepted and under-stood and was administratively convenient.   The wide range of points at eachrank meant that a lesser number of bands than three, would result in too widea spread of job sizes in each band.   Alternatively there seemed no advantage in a large number of bands at the higher rank levels since the pay differentialsbetween the three existing bands were not very big in relation to the salariespaid at these ranks.   Accordingly, it was decided to assume that a three bondsystem would be maintained.Evaluation of Sergeants and Chief Technicians under the skill orientatedfactor plan18.   Trades exercised at the rank of Sergeant and Chief Technician (RAF)were also evaluated under the skill orientated factor plan used for Corporalsin 1969.   The evaluation was carred out by two members of the judging panelwho had been engaged on the Corporal study and the results were closelyscrutinised by the consultant chairman of the panel.The results of the judging showed that as far as Sergeants were concerned:-(i) There was a high degree of correlation between the order of scoresof trades under the two factor plans.(ii) Differences emerged when the results were compared with tradesfully evaluated at the rank of Corporal in 1969.   There was a relatively
high degree of correlation between Corporal trades and the same tradesat the rank of Sergeant evaluated under the skill orientated factorplan, but only a moderate degree of correlation between the Corporalevaluations and those of Sergeants in the same trades under the managerialfactor plan.   Thus use of the skill orientated plan caused lessdisturbance to the Corporal results extended up one rank than did useof the management orientated plan.(iii)   There was a large points overlap between Corporal and Sergeantscores under the skill orientated factor plan as Table 2 shows.Table   2Point ranges for Sergeants and Corporals	Minimum	Maximum	Range	Points	Points	Corporal	232	627	395Sergeant	397*	759*	362**These points cannot be related in any way to those shownin Table 1 at page 5319* As far as Chief Technicians were concerned, there were insufficienttrades in the study to produce a band structure.   But evaluations of established posts demonstrated that the management orientated factor plan was appropriate for this rank level.   A large number of Chief Techniciansare, however, employed in posts established for other (usually lower) ranklevels, an unsatisfactory situation which creates some doubt as to theiroverall role.- 55 -
Allocation of rank/trades not fully evaluated20.   Once the band structure had been decided it was necessary for the judgesto allocate to pay bands those remaining rank/trides that had not been fullyevaluated.   Job descriptions for these rank/trades were prepared by the service authorities and were compared with evaluated rank/trades.   This processproved to be much more difficult than in the Corporal study, mainly because ofthe number of ranks within each trade and the inconsistency of job size inrelation to rank within certain trades demonstrated by the evaluation process.It became apparent that a relatively large number of further evaluations wouldbe necessary before all rank/trades could be finally allocated to a pay band.A number of priority cases were examined but it proved impossible to complete the task in time for thr current pay review.Pay banding of Corporals21.   The evaluation of Sergeant trades under both the management and skillorientated factor plans throws doubt on some of the allocations of Corporaltrades not fully evaluated in 1969.   These trades were evaluated at the rank ofCorporal under the skill orientated factor plan as a matter of priority at thesame time as the priority evaluations mentioned in paragraph 20 above.   Theresults of these evaluations showed that some trades were in too high a bandat Corporal level, but that only about 1 or 2 per cent of all Corporals wouldbe affected.22.   The results of the studies confirm the allocations to pay bands made in1970 in between 8C and 90 per cent of the trades at ranks from Sergeant to warrant Officer Class I.   But in the remaining trades, at some ranks, itappears that pay bands higher or lower than the present ones would be appropriate.   We discuss,in&apos;Chapter 8 ,the problems which will face theServices in implementing the findings of these studies and put forward somesuggestions which may help to resolve them.- 56 -
