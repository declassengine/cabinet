Industrial and Regional DevelopmentFOREWORD1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget statement on 21 March 1972presented the broad framework of the Government^ new and comprehensiveprogramme to stimulate industrial and regional regeneration. The objectives ofthe programme are to promote and sustain faster economic growth; to securethe expansion and modernisation of British industry; to attack the continuingand serious problems of regional imbalance, and to assist industry to meet the challenge of Europe.2. The new programme has a series of related elements the pursuit of general economic policies favourable to industrial confidence and enterprise; new national and regional investment incentives; a new framework for the provisionof special Government assistance; special measures for the retraining andmobility of labour; measures to simplify and speed the administration of controls as they affect industry; further steps to improve infrastructure; andmore effective and direct mobilisation of resources in support of the assisted areas. The aim throughout has been to combine effective action with all possiblesimplicity and certainty in operation.3. The Government will introduce at an early date the legislation needed to implement the proposals in this White Paper.
INTRODUCTION-   . Economic Performance4.   The economic performance of the United Kingdom has been falling behindthat of other,major industrialised countries for a long time. Our rate of growth.has been comparatively low. Modernisation has lagged. Productivity has beenslow to rise.5. The Governments overriding purpose is to achieve a sustained and high rate of national economic growth. The successful negotiation of membership ofthe European Economic Communities provides a necessary and importantframework of new Opportunities for this. A wealthy and expanding market ofsome 290 million people will now be available to British industry and commerce.If however the opportunity is to be effectively seized we must devote a majoreffort to improving our industrial base. The conditions for achieving sustainedgrowth now exist. It is a main purpose of the measures outlined in this white paper to help British industry to seize them.Regional policy. The problem of the older industrial areas is deep-seated and long term. its most serious symptom is the high level of unemployment, but there are others net outward migration, slow economic growth, derelict iand, old and obsoletefactory buildings and often a relatively low level of amenity. Symptoms such as these only too often turn into the causes of further decline.7. The ending of regional imbalance has been an objective of successive governments in the United Kingdom for nearly four decades. Much has been achieved but no solution is yet in sight. A faster rate of national growth is a necessary precondition for effective regional effort as are the growing resourcesnow being applied to modernising the infrastructure and improving the environ-ment. Even so, however, it is clear that the accumulated measures of the years are not enough. New measures to stimulate industrial growth and create freshconfidence are needed. They must be as clear, simple and certain in their impactas possible.BASIC INVESTMENT INCENTIVES-NATIONAL AND REGIONAL8. The new measures proposed are in two main parts. First, countrywide and improved tax allowances for investment in plant, machinery and buildings.Second, regional development grants in the form of cash payments. These will go towards capital expenditure on both new plant and machinery and buildings in the development areas and special development areas; in intermediate areas and, temporarily, in derelict land clearance areas they will go towards capitalexpenditure on buildings. These areas are redefined in paragraphs 28-33.9. As a new departure, tax allowances will be given on the full capital expendi-ture even when part of the expenditure is financed by regional developmentgrants. The separation of tax allowances and grants in this way will enableeach to be administered independently. This will make for greater speed andsimplicity and industry will know clearly what help it can expect.BASIC NATIONAL INCENTIVES10. Since 27 October 1970 investment in machinery and plant, new orsecondhand, has attracted a first-year allowance enabling 60 per cent (80 per centtemporarily from 20 July 1971) of the expenditure to be written off for tax(C783242)A2
purposes in the year in which the expenditure is incurred. The reducing balanceof the expenditure is then written off at the rate of 25 per cent in later years.In development areas expenditure on new machinery and plant (not beingmobile equipment) has qualified for free depreciation in the form of a first-yearallowance of 100 per cent; a restriction of this allowance to machinery boughtfor use for industrial purposes was removed with effect from 20 July 1971.The current allowances on buildings, structures and works that are classified as industrial buildings for tax purposes comprise an initial allowance of 30 percent (40 per cent in assisted areas) and annual writing down allowances of4 per cent of cost.11.  The Chancellor in his Budget speech proposed the following changes :(a) free depreciation in the form of a 100 per cent first-year allowance willbe available throughout the country on all investment in machinery and plant (other than passenger cars). Free depreciation will apply equally to new and secondhand equipment, whether the investment takes placein a development area or not. At the same time there will be extendedto all companies the right, which was previously confined to companies in development areas, to carry back trading losses attributable to free depreciation and to set them against profits of the three preceding years.(b) new industrial buildings and structures will receive an initial allowance of 40 per cent. The level of tax allowances will therefore be the same forall qualifying buildings both inside and outside the assisted areas.The effect of these measures is to give the whole country the favourable treatment in respect of tax allowances on investment previously reserved for the assisted areas.BASIC REGIONAL INCENTIVES12. Extension of free depreciation to the whole country means that the presentdifferential incentive in favour of investment in the development areas will disappear. In these new circumstances the Government have decided to reinforce the incentives provided by free depreciation for plant, and a high initial allowance for buildings, by a system of cash grants in the regions only.13. These grants will supersede the building and operational grants at present available under the Local Employment Act. Assistance under that Act is available only for projects which provide employment. This has ruled outassistance for many modernisation projects. The new grants will not be limited in this way and will, therefore, provide a major incentive for improving theefficiency and competitiveness of industry in the assisted areas. The new grantswill be available to firms already established in the assisted areas on the same basis and at the same rates as to incoming firms. This will encourage developmentfrom within the areas themselves.Regional Development Grants14. In the special development, development and intermediate areas and, for two years, in derelict land clearance areas, regional development grants will bemade towards capital expenditure on new buildings and adapting existing buildings on premises occupied wholly or mainly for carrying on qualifyingactivities in manufacturing, mining and construction. These activities will be,broadly, those described in Orders II to XX of the Standard Industrial Classifica-tion (see Annex A).
15. In the special development and development areas regional developmentgrants will also be made towards capital expenditure on new plant and machinery and on mining works on premises wholly or mainly occupied for carrying on thesame activities.16. In the special development areas, the rate of regional development grantswill be 22 per cent, and in the development areas, intermediate and derelict landclearance areas 20 per cent.17. The nationalised industries as such will not be excluded from the new arrangements, but, with the important exceptions of coal and steel, the mainactivities of the nationalised industries will not, in general, qualify for grant.18. It is intended to make special arrangements for the construction industryso that grant may be paid on new plant and machinery provided for use in development areas, even though it may not be confined to premises wholly or mainly occupied for carrying on that industry.19. Where the assets on which grant may be paid are the subject of leasing orhiring arrangements (including hire purchase) the grant will be payable to thelessor or owner.20. The agricultural, forestry and fishing industries will not qualify for grantsas these are already assisted by Government schemes. The Agricultural ministers will be keeping under review the assistance provided under these schemes.21. Grants will not, in general, be made to local authorities but they will beavailable on new industrial buildings which local authorities lease to anoccupant in a qualifying activity.22.   Pipelines and most vehicles will not be eligible.23. It is intended that grants will not be made on individual items of plant and machinery costing less than  100 or on individual building schemes costingless than  1,000.Starting Date24. Capital expenditure on plant, machinery and mining works incurredbefore 22 March 1972 and capital expenditure on buildings started on site, before that date will not be eligible for regional development grants nor will expen-diture on which investment grant under the Industrial Development Act 1966 ismade.25. Consideration will be given to applications for building grant under theLocal Employment Act received before 22 March 1972 and to applicationsreceived after that date in respect of buildings on which any expenditure was incurred under a contract entered into before that date in the then existingassisted areas.26. As it presses ahead with new investment, industry should retain all relevantdocuments so that applications for the new grants can be made as soon as parliament has passed the necessary legislation. The Department of Trade andIndustry will announce as soon as practicable further details of the new arrange-ments, including those for making applications.
BOUNDARIES OF ASSISTED AREAS27. As part of the present review the Government have re-examined theseboundaries.28. The Government have concluded that there should be no significant changesin the extent of the existing development areas and special development areasat the present time.29. There are, however, wide areas outside the development and special develop-ment areas facing problems, including industrial obsolescence, which meritspecial consideration. This need is already recognised by the designation of some parts of them as intermediate areas and by the much more extensive derelictland clearance areas.30. The Government now propose to extend intermediate area status to thewhole of the North West and Yorkshire and Humberside planning regionsoutside the present development areas as recommended by the Hunt Committee.Those parts of Wales which are not already assisted areas will be designated asintermediate areas. The town of Winsford which has hitherto been treated as adetached part of the Merseyside development area will form part of the newintermediate area; regional employment premium will, however, continue to bepaid there.31. Intermediate areas so extended will qualify for the regional developmentgrant in respect of buildings but not for plant and machinery. The specialtemporary improvement grants available under the Housing Act 1971 will beextended to the new areas.32. In the remainder of the derelict land clearance area lying in the NorthMidlands the Government propose to make the new grant in respect of buildingsavailable for a period of two years from 22 March 1972.33. The table at Annex B sets out the types of assistance to be available in thevarious areas which are themselves shown in Annex C.SELECTIVE ASSISTANCE-REGIONAL AND NATIONAL34. Selective assistance is at present available for investment in the development and the special development areas under the Local Employment Act. But it hasto be directed almost wholly to projects providing additional employment.Such help needs to be available as well for the modernisation of industry. this form of help should also be available in intermediate areas. The Governmentwill seek fresh powers for these purposes.35. This form of regional assistance will be administered as soon as possible by the new Executive described in paragraphs 39-46 below. The effect will beto broaden the scope for selective assistance as an essential and flexible comple-ment to basic incentives, and increasingly to concentrate responsibility for its administration in the regions themselves so that the fullest account is taken of regional needs, and the fullest use made of regional experience, knowledge, and enthusiasm. Thus ihe regions will be encouraged to play a much fuller and more direct part in their own development.36. On occasion, particularly in view of our entry into Europe, it may benecessary to consider the wider structure of an industry or a major projectbeyond the boundaries of the assisted areas. The Government will seek newpowers also to provide selective assistance more widely in such cases. This wouldnot be intended in any way to replace existing private sources of industrialfinance.
SHIPBUILDING- 37. The short-term difficulties of the shipbuilding industry are urgent and immediate help is needed. Over 90 per cent of the employment provided by themain merchant shipbuilding firms is in the development areas. The long-term- appraisal required will be handled as a matter of urgency by the new Executivewithin the Department of Trade and Industry described below.38. In the meantime, to safeguard employment in the industry and itssuppliers, the Government has decided to provide temporary assistance by offering tapering grants in the period 1972-74 in respect of the construction and equipment of new ships over 100 gross tons (except for ships for use bythe Royal Navy and Government Departments). These grants to the ship-building industry will be at a rate of 10 per cent on the contract value of work carried out in 1972, and at rates of 4 per cent and 3 per cent in 1973 and 1974respectively. The cost will depend upon the level of activity in the industry andthe contract prices of ships under construction during 1972 to 1974. One of the major factors affecting the performance of this industry is the state of itsindustrial relations and successful reconstruction of the industry must be basedon the assurance that there will be full co-operation between employers and unions and a readiness on the part of both to join with the Department ofEmployment in discussions about the necessary measures to improve industrial relations.INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT EXECUTIVE39. The Prime Minister will be nominating a Minister for Industrial Develop-ment under the broad direction of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.He will have special responsibility for private sector industry generally and for industrial development in the assisted areas. He will carry out his responsibilities in particularly close association with the Secretary of State for the environment and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Wales. He will be supportedby a Parliamentary Under Secretary of State.40. The Minister will take charge of an Industrial Development Executiveoutlined in Annex D. This Executive will include the Divisions of the Departmentof Trade and Industry concerned with regional development and small firms, andthe Department^ regional offices. It will be responsible for the new regional development grants. The Divisions dealing with specific sectors of private industry are an essential part of the base for tackling regional industrial develop-ment as well as national growth and expansion and will, therefore, be includedin the new Executive. The Government intend to start creating the newExecutive at once and to bring it fully into being at the earliest possible moment.41. The Minister will be assisted by a Permanent Secretary, who will also bethe Accounting Officer, and a Director of Industrial Development. The Directorwill rank as a Permanent Secretary and will be appointed from the private sector. Within the Executive a Development Unit will also be set up to help withthe appraisal and implementation of industrial development needs. The newExecutive will recruit staff from the City and from industry as necessary toprovide a full range of financial, industrial and administrative expertise.42. The Minister will be advised by an Industrial Development Board whichwill comprise within its membership prominent persons in industry, banking,accounting and finance, and international industrial investment with particularemphasis on relations with Europe. The Board will be available to advisegenerally on industry-wide problems and priorities, and to consider specificmajor cases for selective assistance.
43. A strong regional organisation based on the regional offices of theDepartment of Trade and Industry will be an essential part of the new executive in the assisted areas. This organisation will have a new positive role in promotingindustrial expansion and modernisation, and in stimulating centres of growth.It will have an important degree of devolved authority. It will co-operate closely with local authorities and other bodies and agencies, and provide advice and assistance to industry across the whole field of responsibility of the Departmentof Trade and Industry. It will have full and direct access to the industrial andfinancial expertise within the Industrial Development Executive.44. In Scotland and Wales, the Northern, the Yorkshire and Hurnberside andthe North West Regions, Regional Industrial Directors will be appointed with similar functions at regional level to those of the Director of IndustrialDevelopment at headquarters with whom in particular they will maintain closelinks. Regional Industrial Development Boards will be set up to advise generally on regional industrial opportunities and in due course on applications for selective financial assistance for the development of industry in their regions. InScotland and in Wales these new appointments will be made in consultationwith the Secretaries of State for those countries. The new organisation inScotland and in Wales will work in the closest touch with the Scottish Office andthe Welsh Office to ensure the full integration of development policies overall.In the English regions there will be similar close relations with the regional offices of the Department of the Environment.45. Similar arrangements will be made for the South West Region, and a newoffice will be established in Plymouth so that the problems of.the assisted areasin the South West can be more effectively assessed.46. The administration of the regional development grants will be undertakenfrom offices located in Billingham, Bootle, Cardiff and Glasgow.47. The existing Regional Economic Planning Councils and the Boardsassociated with them will continue in being. The links between them and the regional offices of the Department of Trade and Industry will, however, be strengthened so that the process of industrial regeneration in a region and the overall planning of its land use and other physical resources are properlyco-ordinated. The Scottish Economic Council and the Welsh Council willcontinue to discharge their existing consultative and advisory functions towards their respective Secretaries of State in this and in other fields.ADAPTATION OF CONTROLS48. In order to remove impediments to industrial development the Governmenthave decided on the following measures:(a) Planning applications for industrial development. The Secretary of Statefor the Environment and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Walesare making special arrangements within their Departments to ensurethat planning applications and appeals relating to major industrial building proposals are considered more quickly; local authorities arebeing asked to adapt their procedures to give such cases priority. Thiswill not affect the criteria by which decisions are reached under the planning Acts to which no change is proposed.(b) Industrial Development Certificates. The existing exemption limit, belowwhich industrial development certificates are not required, is 10,000 sq ftexcept in the South East, East Anglia and the Midlands where the limit is 5,000 sq ft. The exemption limit will be raised by Order to 15,000 sq ft
in all areas except the South East Economic Planning Region where thelimit will be raised to 10,000 sq ft. It is also proposed to dispense withthe need for industrial development certificates in the development and special development areas. Elsewhere, industrial development certificateswill be more readily granted than hitherto for schemes of factorymodernisation which involve some increase in the number of employees.These changes will provide greater flexibility and scope for modernisa-tion while still retaining the essential purpose of the idc control which isto seek to divert potentially mobile industrial projects to the areas ofgreatest employment need.(c) Office Development Permits. There is no case for removing this control inview of the planning pressures in the South East. But in the admini-stration of the control special account will be taken of the importanceof enhancing the prospects of London as an international financial and commercial centre.DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND INDUSTRY FACTORY ESTATES49. Under the present law the Department of Trade and Industry maypurchase land and construct factories for projects providing employment butnot for the rehousing of existing industry in modern premises. It is proposed toremove this constraint. It is also proposed to enable the three Industrial EstateCorporations which manage the Departments estates more freedom than hitherto to manage, by agreement, factories and estates owned by other public authorities.REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT PREMIUM50. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated in his Budget statement,the regional employment premium will be phased out over a period from september 1974. The rate and method of phasing out will be announced in due course in the light of the circumstances at the time and after consultation with industry.RE-EMPLOYMENT AND MOBILITY OF LABOUR51. The Government have already taken a series of measures designed toimprove the working of the labour market.52. The Employment Service is being modernised and the Government hasembarked on a major programme to expand the training facilities which will beavailable to individuals through a new Training Opportunities Scheme. the target is to provide training opportunities for 100,000 people a year and atleast 60-70,000 by 1975 as compared with less than 20,000 in 1971. this programme will involve additional expenditure on training centres and allow-ances to trainees of the order of  100m in total over the next four years. A plan to establish a new Central Training Agency is under discussion and this Agency,if established, would maintain close liaison with the new Industrial DevelopmentExecutive to ensure that the developing needs of industry were met by thetraining facilities provided.      /53. Schemes for helping firms in assisted areas with the training of their workers have been improved. Grants are now given to firms which provide additionaljobs in assisted areas and the weekly rate of grant has been increased from  10 aweek for men to  15 and from  7 a week for women to  12 for the period
during which they are being trained. A new scheme of grants to firms which areprepared to retrain workers who would otherwise be made redundant has alsobeen introduced. In 1971 a new grant was introduced in the assisted areas to firms who engage and train workers over 45 who have been unemployed for at least eight weeks. The grant covers the period of training and these rates also have been increased to  15 for men and  12 for women.54. The Government now also intend to give more help to workers who are willing to move their homes to have a better chance of a satisfactory job. Thiswill be done by making the Resettlement Transfer Scheme more attractive for workers who live in the assisted areas and move their home to get a new job,and also for people who undertake substantial courses of training under theTraining Opportunities Scheme and have to move in order to get a job in whichthey can use their new skills. For trainees the previous grant of  100 to meetmiscellaneous expenses involved in the move will be replaced by a new rehousinggrant of  600. This will be available for six months after the end of the trainingcourse for workers anywhere in the country who need to move. A rehousinggrant of  400 will also be available for workers whose home is in the assisted areas and move to get a new job whether within the assisted areas or outsidethem. Other improvements in the benefits available under the Scheme are also being introduced. These new levels of assistance are intended to help thosewho are prepared to accept the substantial upheaval of moving home to getemployment.55. Taken together, these measures are designed to make a major impact onour ability to deal with the labour problems of structural change, particularlyin the assisted areas, and to enable workers to participate more fully in theregeneration programme.COMMUNICATIONS AND EUROPE56. Efficient and speedy communications will be a key element for competitivesuccess of British industry within the Community. The substantial investmentnow under way in ports giving access to Europe should provide ample portcapacity. The strategic road programme announced by the Government last june is designed to provide a network of motorways or other modern high-speedroads linking all main industrial areas and provide comprehensive improvedaccess routes from the network to all the major ports. The Government hasdecided to accelerate as much as possible the improvement of the roads toTilbury, Felixstowe/Harwich and Hull, and the construction of the motorwaysbetween Birmingham and Nottingham and between Coventry and Leicester.The completion of these schemes will significantly reduce journey times on these routes which are very important to industrial traffic.57. In Scotland, where access to and improvements of east coast ports is ofparticular significance in the context both of our entry to Europe and the exploitation of North Sea oil potential, the Government have decided to accelerate the improvement of the main routes between Central Scotland, Perthand Invergordon, and between Dundee and Aberdeen. Substantial investment is being undertaken in Scottish east coast ports and further projects are nowunder consideration.58. In Wales, additional funds will be made available for development and thecompletion of certain important strategic routes, including in particular theextension of the M4 westwards across South Wales.
VALUE OF MAIN MEASURES* 59. The total value to industry in any year is directly linked to their response to the new incentives. However, the extension of free depreciation and industrial building allowances to the whole country is estimated to cost  115m in 1973/74* in line with the forecast for economic growth set out in the Budget speech, rising to  450m in 1975/76. The regional development grants are estimated to amountto about  250m in 1973/74, rising to about  300m in 1975/76. The production grants for shipbuilding in the period up to 1974 will cost up to  50m, the bulkof it concentrated in the development areas. In addition, selective assistance willcontinue to be available to industry in the development areas and also more widely.CONCLUSIONS60. The new programme re-affirms the Government^ determination to providea substantial and lasting impetus to profitable industrial expansion, modernisa-tion and regional regeneration, and to a higher growth rate for the seventies. Inorder to give industry the confidence it requires to invest, the government intend to maintain the new system of incentives at lea,st until the transitional period of entry to Europe is over, ie, to 1 January 1978.
