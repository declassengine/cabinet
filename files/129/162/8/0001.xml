annex draft WHITE paper the PUBLIC TRUSTEE office. In May 1971 the Government announced,  in written answers to parliamentary Questions, that they had decided to set up an enquiry intothe r Ae played by the Public Trustee Office in modern conditions,  includ-ing the extent to which its continued existence v/as justifiable given thealternative facilities now available.    The enquiry was undertaken byMr. H. R. Hutton, formerly a Director of Hambros Bank Limited, atpresent on secondment tc the Civil Service Department;        ...Mr. D. J. W. Drybuigh, a senior partner in Taylor and Humbert,Solicitors;  and Sir Clifford Jarrett, formerly Permanent Secretary at theDepartment of Health and Social Security.    The full text of their report is contained in the attachment to this White Paper.2. The Committee point out that their enquiries have establishedcertain salient facts in connection with the work for which the Public TrustOffice was originally established:a. demand for the service of the Office has shown a steady decline;b. new business is increasingly composed of executor-ships rather than new or transferred settlements ortrusts created under Wills;c. the business of the Office&apos;s main competitors doesnot show a similar decline;d. the proportion of the market which the office services is very small.They conclude that if the Office were left to continue/unaltered it wouldsteadily run down.    Taking account of the multiplier effects which couldbe expected after business had fallen away to an extent sufficient to affectmorale and efficiency, they do not think that in its existing form the office could offer a reasonable service after about 10-15 years of further declineThey therefore go on to make a series of recommendations, designed tophase out the work of the Public Trustee Office in an orderly fashionconsistent with the obligations which have been incurred.
3. The Government have carefully considered the Committee&apos;s analysis of the long-term prospects of the Public Trustee Gffice, and of the problemsof continuing the organisation in its existing form during a period when thework seems certain to continue to decline, and are in general agreementwith the Committee&apos;s recommendations.    Legislation will be brought forward in due course to relieve the Public Trustee from the duty of accepting, new business.    Meanwhile, as suggested by the Committee, the public TrusteeOffice will be merged with the Official Solicitor&apos;s Department.    separate consideration will be given to the future of the investment managementdivision, including the Committee&apos;s suggestion that it should be established as an entirely separate investment management unit for funds in the public sector under an independent Board of Management.    The Government intends to initiate discussions as soon as possible with representatives of thecommercial corporate trustees and the Law Society on the Committee&apos;recommendation that settlers and beneficiaries of trusts now with the public trustee should be offered the opportunity, for a specified but limited period,to accept transfer to another trustee, free of expense to the trust and them-selves.    If satisfactory arrangements can be agreed, appropriate provision will be made in the legislation.4. The position of trusts at present under administration by the public trustee Office will be fully safeguarded; any which, for one reason or another, are not transferred to another trustee will continue to be administered by the new Official Solicitor and Trustee Department.    as recommended by the Committee, the staff of both offices will be fully informed and consulted on the organisational issues for staff involved inthe introduction of the new structure.    It is hoped that most of the staffconcerned can be found suitable posts elsewhere in the public service,either in the new Official Solicitor and Trustee Department or in other government departments.Lord Chancellor,&apos;s Department,House of Lords, S.W. 1.2 March 1972.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO THEPUBLIC TRUSTEE OFFICENOVEMBER   1971/
To the Right Honourable Lord Hailsham of St. marylebone lord High Chancellor of Creat Britainandthe Right Honourable the Earl jellicoe lord Privy SealMy Lords,Your Lordships appointed us in May 1971 as a Committee with thefollowing terms of reference:&quot;To examine the functions and organization of the Public TrusteeOffice and to consider:a. the role played by the Public Trustee Office in modern conditions and whether or to what extent its continued existence is justifiable given the alternativefacilities available;b. if it were not to continue, what alternative arrangements should be made for the continuing administration of exist-ing trusts, and how quickly these arrangements could bebrought into being;c. whether, if a Public Trustee Office is to be preserved,it is possible or reasonable in modern conditions to expect the Public Trustee Office to pay its way;d. whether steps could be taken to re-organize the Office,improve its managerial effectiveness and make it morecommercially accountable, whether or not it is still re-quired to pay its way.&quot;We have now completed our enquiry and have the honour to submit thefollowing report.We are,Your Lordships&apos; obedient servants,(Signed)   H.

PUBLIC   TRUSTEE   office.     The Committee has held 20 meetings between June and November1971, including a visit to the Public Trustee Office.2.     A list of the witnesses we have consulted will be found inAppendix 1.     We would not wish to submit our report without recordingour gratitude for the assistance we have received from theseorganizations and individuals.     Without the benefit of their experience and their willingness to discuss the problems so freely before theCommittee our task would have been immensely more difficult.     The public trustee and his immediate predecessor, together with a large number ofhis staff, took great pains to provide us with all the information and help we required, and many of the other witnesses had gone to considerabletrouble to prepare themselves before coming to see us.     We would alsolike to express our appreciation for the large number of letters we received, both directly and indirectly, offering helpful information oropinions.3.     We would also wish particularly to express our indebtedness to oursecretary whose knowledge and diligence have made a vital contributionnot only to our report but also to the process of our work.HISTORICAL   BACKGROUND4.     In 1919 a Committee under the chairmanship of the right honourable Sir George H. Murray, G.C.B. reported on the organizationand fees structure of the Public Trustee Office.     Certain reforms and increases in fees resulted from this report.     The Public Trustee office was next examined in 1955 when a Committee under the chairmanship ofSir Maurice Holmes, G.B.E., K.G.B. submitted to the then Lord Chancellora report on its work, organization and financial conditions.     This
report was published in May 1956 as Cmnd. 9755-     We have drawn freelyon the descriptive parts of this report in our own deliberations, andhave thought it unnecessary to repeat here the admirable and comprehensiveoutline of the genesis and early years of the Public Trustee Office whichthe Holmes Committee provided.     In the interests of brevity, we have further omitted from our report such other descriptions of the work orproblems of the Public Trustee Office as can be found, with continuingaccuracy, in the Holmes Report.5-     Nevertheless a brief summary of the development of the Office ofthe Public Trustee is necessary to provide the setting for our ownenquiry.     The Office was set up under the Public Trustee Act, 1906,the Attorney General having given as its main raison d&apos;etre the difficultyof inducing private persons to accept the onerous responsibilities of atrustee, and the losses incurred by beneficiaries as a result of incom-competence or dishonesty on the part of private trustees.     Under the Actfees are fixed by the Treasury with the sanction of the Lord Chancellor bymeans of Orders laid before Parliament.     The Act states that they shallbe such as to produce an annual amount sufficient to discharge the salaries and other expenses incidental to the working of the Act and no more.     The Act also states that the Consolidated Fund shall be liableto make good all sums required to discharge any liability which thePublic Trustee, if he were a private trustee, would be personally liableto discharge.     Under the Act the Public Trustee may decline to accept any trust but may not do so on the ground only of the small value of the trust property.6.     The Holmes Committee pointed out that in the early years of theOffice the Public Trustee had very little competition.     Although thereexisted before 1906 a number of companies whose memoranda and articlesof association permitted them to undertake trust administration, theydid so only to a negligible extent.     After 1906 banks and insurance companies began to take on trust work, but the Public Trustee suffered
little at first from their competition;    this was partly because grants of probate could not be issued to them as corporations but had to betaken out on their behalf by syndics.     This disadvantage was removed by Section 17 of the Administration of Justice Act, 1920 which empoweredthe Court to grant probate to a corporation.     From 1920 onwards, thecompetition of other corporate trustees, the Committee noted, had an ever-increasing effect on the business of the Public Trustee.     TheCommittee gave statistics showing that by 1949 the Public Trustee had20,226 cases under administration;   by 1955 this figure had fallen to17,732.     They concluded that the trustee facilities then offered bythe banks and insurance companies, and the protection afforded by theLaw Society against defalcations by solicitors, made up a very differentpicture from that which presented itself in 1906;   had similar conditionsexisted at that time, there would have been little occasion for thecreation of the office of Public Trustee.     They added, however, thatthis was by no means the same thing as saying that the   Public Trusteehad outlived his usefulness, and went on to recommend that the office should be left in being subject to certain administrative and financialreforms.7.     Since the Holmes Committee reported, demand for the services of thePublic Trustee has, in general, continued to decline.     By the 31stMarch 1971 total cases under administration had fallen to 11,910, littleover half the figure for 1949-     This was in spite of advertisingcampaigns, which the Holmes Committee had advocated.     Moreover, therehas also been a change in the nature of the cases being accepted bythe office:    executorships, or similar relatively short term cases, nowform an increasing proportion of new work.     If this trend continuesthe Office will thus, in the course of time, be becoming a PublicExecutor rather than a Public Trustee.     There is of course a number of reasons for this trend, not least being the change in the fiscalconsiderations governing trusts and estate duties, but we are of theopinion that, in the light of current knowledge and if no special steps are taken, there is little reason to expect much change in the underlyingpattern of new business.
8.     The Public Trustee has, over the years, undertaken a number ofother tasks in addition to those for which the Office was originallyset up.     These include the trusteeship of the Chequers trust fund,and management of the Wellington Parliamentary Trust (as personalAttorney for the Chancellor of the Exchequer);   management of the Indiaand Kenya Pension Funds, as well as the House of Commons Pension Fund;the administration of a number of disaster funds;   and the provision of advice to the Law Commission and on legislation affecting trusts generally.During both World Wars the Public Trustee acted as Custodian of enemy property;   and under the Law of Property Acts the Public Trustee is arepository of certain legal   titles and has to deal with those titlesparticularly in a case of undivided shares.     In addition, under the1965 Administration of Justice Act the Lord Chancellor was empoweredto establish schemes for common investment funds under the management and control of the Public Trustee for the investment of Funds in Court.The Funds in the Common Investment Scheme amount at present to just over  23m, and the total value of all cases under administration at31st March 1971 is estimated at  210m.THE   ALTERNATIVE   FACILITIES9.     Against this pattern of falling demand for the services of thePublic Trustee, we have examined the relevant factors on the supplyside of the market in which the Office operates.     We sought evidenceparticularly from the Committee of London Clearing Bankers, theBritish Insurance Association and the appropriate professionalassociations (see Appendix 1 for full list of witnesses).10.   Solicitors and accountants deal with the majority of executorshipsand trusteeships.     Indeed they are frequently involved even in caseswhere there is a corporate trustee or executor.     We accordingly invitedevidence from the Law Society and the Institute of Chartered Accountants,and also received memoranda and letters from some local Law societies and individual solicitors.     Although the system of charging differs
between solicitors and accountants they frequently act together asjoint trustees - the representatives of the Institute of CharteredAccountants thought that this was, in fact, the most desirablearrangement.     Both the lawyers and accountants thought that re-lat-ively few members of their respective professions had directexperience of the Public Trustee Office;   its tariffs had noinfluence on their scales or systems of charging.     In the opinion ofthe representatives of the Law Society, some solicitors   value theexistence of the Public Trustee as a trustee of last resort.     Evidencemade available to us from certain local Law Societies, which were consulted at our request, shows however that in many parts of the countrysolicitors make little or no use of the Public Trustee Office.     It isalso relevant in this connection that there is no Public Trustee inScotland.     We have consulted both the Law Society of Scotland and theScottish Office, who told us that there has never been any pressure forthe creation of such an office, nor any suggestion that the facilities available in Scotland are inadequate.11.   As already noted corporate trustee facilities are provided by the banks and by certain insurance companies.     The representatives of theinsurance companies indicated that not more than twelve companies are involved in trustee and executor business, although no precisestatistics are available.     They stated that the facilities are main-tained primarily to complete the range of services they can offer totheir customers, and trust work is accepted more because of the valueof a customer, or sometimes an agent, to the overall business of theinstitution than for the attractiveness of the work itself.     the clearing banks, on the other hand, have an extensive network of trustee branches and are administering at the present time well over100,000 cases.     They thus represent the dominant element in thecompetition faced by the Public Trustee Office as a corporate trustee.Both the banks and the insurance companies are facing similar costproblems, but we were told that, although their tariffs are not greatlydifferent from those of the Public Trustee, the level of his charges
does not affect theirs to any significant extent.     Both the banks andthe insurance companies, of course, offer settlers and beneficiariesprotection by the strength of their resources and the provisions of theCompanies Acts.12.   As far as the work of executorship is concerned, it has to benoted that for the bulk of the smaller cases, a professional orcorporate executor is not necessary at all.     For most people the best and least expensive way of winding up an estate is to make personalapplication for Probate, and in the past five years approximately77j500 such applications have been dealt with at the Probate Registry.It is fair to add that the Public Trustee himself frequently advisesthe use of this procedure for small and straightforward estates towhich he has been appointed executor.13.   This brief survey of the various facilities for executorship andtrusteeship shows that the vast majority of this business is handled by the commercial institutions, solicitors, accountants and other private persons.     The Public Trustee receives only a minimal, anddeclining, proportion of the total work in this field.     The evidence we have received thus abundantly confirms the opinion expressed by theHolmes Committee that there would be no sufficient reason to set up aPublic Trustee Office if such an office were not already in existence.14.   There is a very small number of cases for which the facilitieswe have described are alleged not to provide a completely satisfactoryservice.     We have received a number of letters, and several witnesseshave spoken to us, about families where, for example, parents are anxious to make arrangements before their death for children or otherdependents who are not likely to be able to look after their own affairs.     Such testators often consider, or are advised, that thefacilities of the Public Trustee Office are superior to those of the banks or other trustees available, in that the Lady Visitor will givepersonal attention to the happiness and welfare of the beneficiairies.
At the present time the Lady Visitor has some 250 cases on her books,and.we have no doubt that her work on behalf of these people is whollyadmirable.     Equally we have no doubt that there are many more suchcases in the care of solicitors or private trustees.     The represent-atives of the banks and the insurance companies assured us that theytoo are quite used to administering cases involving welfare problems.Representatives of the Department of Health and Social Security told us that cases of this kind are referred by local authority welfare officers to banks and solicitors.     Moreover, local welfare facilities should be greatly expanded over the coming years as the reforms re-sulting from the Seebohm Report take effect.THE   FUTURE   OF   THE   PUBLIC   TRUSTEE   OFFICE15.   Our enquiries, as outlined in the previous section of this Report,have established certain salient facts in connection with the trustwork for which the Office was originally established:a. demand for the services of the Office has shown a steady decline;b. new business is increasingly composed of executor-ships rather than new or transferred settlements ortrusts created under Wills;c. the business of the Office&apos;s main competitors doesnot show a similar decline;d. the proportion of the market which the Office servesis very small.If the Office were to be left in being, we see no reason to expect achange in the declining demand for its services. All the witnesseshave confirmed that the establishment of trusts is by no means as
widespread as it was, a fact which is borne out by the trend alreadynoted towards straight executorships in new business being offered to the Office.     Indeed, given that many of the trusts at present underadministration by the Office are of long standing, the decline seems likely if anything to accelerate.     Secondly, we are convinced thatthe overwhelming majority of testators and settlers will continue to choose the facilities provided by the banks, insurance companies,solicitors, accountants and others.     So far as small estates areconcerned, the 77,500 personal applications to the Probate Registryin the last five years, to which v/e have already drawn attention,compare with less than 1,000 executorships undertaken by the public trustee Office over the same period.     If, therefore, the Office were left to continue unaltered it would steadily run down to an eventualdeath.     Taking account of the multiplier effects which could beexpected after business had fallen away to an extent sufficient to&quot;affect morale and efficiency, we do not think that in   its existingform the Office could offer a reasonable service after about ten to fifteen years of further decline.     In the meantime it would be necessary toraise fees to keep pace with rising operating costs (and thus probablyaccelerate the decline) or to subsidise the Office in order to maintain a service for the small or unremunerative cases.16.   We have considered whether steps should or could be taken to reverse the trend of business in order to maintain the Office as a viable, separate organization.     This would require a policy of activecompetition, particularly with the banks.     Selective advertisementcampaigns have hitherto been the main mean? of competing for business,but we do not believe that advertising in itself would bring aboutthe turn-round which would be required.     For this to be achieved weconsider that a network of branch offices would be essential.     ThePublic Trustee told us that he thought three or four branches would suffice, located in, say, the North, the Midlands and the West Country;
in view of the fact that one of the clearing banks alone has 58 trusteebranches in England and Wales, we think that he might need more.     nor do we think that anything short of full branch offices would be effective:   local agencies or representatives, and Post Offices used as a means of contacting the public, would all produce a standard ofservice below that which the banks provide.     Secondly, we do notconsider tha t in today1s conditions the Public Trustee could expect to compete with banks and other corporate trustees without thoroughmechanisation:   manual systems of accounting and record-keeping would need to be replaced with modern computers and micro-film storage ofinformation.     Such improvements cannot be obtained piece-meal or atlow cost.     We therefore conclude that considerable capital expenditure would be essential, and higher operating costs a consequence, if thePublic Trustee Office were to be put in a position to secure a larger share of the available business in its sphere of operations.     More-over, to succeed in this and to continue to cover its costs the office would have to set out to attract substantial trusts rather than smallestates.17.   Two other alternatives which we have considered would be simply to allow the Office to continue its steady and protracted decline,or to close it immediately and to transfer all its existing businesselsewhere.     We cannot believe that the first of these courses wouldbe satisfactory and therefore we cannot recommend it.     The staff would be faced with an indefinite future of reducing activity, and ultimately the very small inflow of new work would be of a kind largelyirrelevant to the purposes for which the Office was set up.     Thesecond course would involve the unilateral&apos;imposition of new trusteeson the beneficiaries of trusts at present being administered by thePublic Trustee Office,, which we would regard as undesirable.     More-over a winding up operation involving a unilateral decision of thiskind could be represented as a breach of faith, since, when these cases were accepted, the expectation was held out that the services of thePublic Trustee would be there for the whole life of the trust.     For
practical reasons, therefore, we find ourselves unable to recommendthis course.18.   It is thus necessary to devise an intermediate course to phaseout the work of the Public Trustee Office in an orderly fashion as rapidly as may be consistent with the obligations which have been incurred.     Our recommendations have two essential features.     First,from a forward date to be announced, the Public Trustee Office should accept no new cases.     Secondly, the beneficiaries of trusts at presentadministered by the Public Trustee should be offered the option of a free transfer to other trustees.     The implications of these proposals are examined in the following paragraphs.19.   Legislation would be necessary to relieve the Public Trusteefrom the duty of accepting new business;    there are various additionalpoints which such an Act would need to cover, the most important ofwhich are set out in Appendix 2.     We assume that it would not bepossible to anticipate this Act in setting the date for the refusal of new cases.     This underlines the importance of introducing thelegislation at the earliest possible moment, but we would not expectit to be complicated or contentious.20.   So far as existing trusts are concerned, the Public Trustee,like any other trustee, already has the power to retire;   in which case new trustees would have to be appointed in his place.     In this special situation, however, we recommend that settlers or benefic-iaries should be approached and offered the opportunity to accepttransfer to another trustee, free of all expense to the trust and themselves.     We suggest that this offer should remain open for a specified but limited period;   if transfer was not accepted it would,of course, still be open to the Public Trustee to retire if he was satisfied that this would be in the interest of the trust.     Therepresentatives of the clearing banks have expressed the opinion that
their trustee departments would be able to accept some, if not most,of the existing business of the Public Trustee Office, and have offered the services of one or two of their members to serve on ajoint working party to determine in greater detail the arrangements which would be necessary.     We recommend that this working party should be established as soon as possible, and that an invitationshould be extended also    to the British Insurance Association and theLaw Society to nominate representatives to participate.     The working party will have to give special consideration to the question of fees,and it may be that special rates could be negotiated.     The fees to bepaid to the new trustee on acceptance would, of course, have to be met out of public funds;    similarly the Public Trustee would have to waivehis normal withdrawal fee.     We are not in a position to attempt a precise estimate of these costs, but a once-for-all cost of this kindmust be compared with the savings resulting from an earlier reduction inthe number of civil servants who would be engaged on this work if no action were taken.21.   There is the further question of original Wills deposited inthe strongroom of the Public Trustee.     There are about 5,500 of these,including some so old as to make it highly unlikely that they will evercome into operation, some appointing the Public Trustee only as a last resort, and some which will almost certainly have been revoked.It is improbable, therefore, that the Public Trustee would be calledupon to act in more than, say, two-thirds of these cases even if he remained open to new business.     Although, of course, there is no obligation in.respect of these Wills (or of any others in which thePublic Trustee is named as executor which have not been deposited withhim), we nevertheless think that an effort should be made to returnthem, together with a Standard form of codicil for the appointment ofa new executor or trustee (where appropriate), to the testator orsolicitor who deposited them.
22.   After the procedure we have recommended has been carried outthere may well remain some trusts which, for one reason or another,have not been transferred.     For such trusts it would be necessaryto maintain in being part at least of the staff and facilities ofthe Public Trustee Office.     In order to provide a more stable future for the employees, and a stronger departmental base for theadministration of beneficiaries&apos; affairs, we recommend that thePublic Trustee Office should be merged with the Official Solicitor&apos;department.     We think it would be desirable to proceed with thisamalgamation, noWithstanding that there may be some delay in the implementation of our other recommendations.     We understand that theOfficial Solicitor has signified his readiness in principle to accept this proposal;   although there would be many details to be worked out,we are convinced that a merger would be both practicable and desirable.The greater the scope of the new department, the better would be thecareer prospects for the staff, and we therefore further recommend that consideration be given to the possibility of transferring to the newOfficial Solicitor and Trustee Department the bona vacantia work atpresent undertaken by the Treasury Solicitor.23.   The future of the investment division of the Public TrusteeOffice needs special consideration.     This division is responsiblefor the investment not only of trust funds under administration, butalso of Funds in Court under the 1965 Administration of Justice Actand of the various other funds mentioned in paragraph 8 above.     Weare impressed by the way in which, despite considerable problems, the division has.been carrying out its responsibilities:   in general its performance has been satisfactory.     It is clear to us, however, thatthe specialist skills and technical problems involved in investmentmanagement are of a different kind from those encountered in thelegal and administrative work of either the Public Trustee or theOfficial Solicitor.     Furthermore, there are substantial advantages of scale in the field of investment management, and it does not appear
that the volume of funds to be administered by the new OfficialSolicitor and Trustee Department would remain sufficient to justify   ,the mechanisation and other expenses which efficiency in investmentmanagement requires.     We therefore recommend that immediate con-sideration be given to the establishment of this division as anentirely separate investment management unit to manage these fundson behalf of the new department, together with other funds in thepublic, sector.     The unit would need to be clearly and evidentlyinsulated from all political influence, and for this reason should operate under an independent Board of Management.     In this connectionwe have noted the proposal in the recent Fnite Paper Strategy for pensions (Cmnd 4655) for an independent Board of Management with responsibility for investing the funds which would arise under theproposed new Reserve Scheme.     It would be for consideration whether there might be some relationship between the facilities required forthe Reserve Scheme and the unit we envisage.24-   We are concerned that the implementation of the proposals wehave made should not be allowed to overburden the resources of thePublic Trustee Office.     As the Public Trustee himself has emphasisedto us,   it is also important that the changes should be carried throughwith maximum despatch.     We therefore recommend that; within the newmerged department, the Lord chancellors Office should establish aspecial unit responsible for ensuring that the necessary processesare carried out on schedule.     We consider that, with properorganization, the whole exercise should be completed within 18 months or 2 years.     In this connection we would mention particularly that wedo not believe it would be necessary to produce full accounts forall transferred trusts, provided that an agreed list of assets withtheir acquisition details could be produced to, and accepted by, thenew trustees, and satisfactory arrangements or indemnities could be worked out, wherever necessary, to cover tax and duty liabilities.
25-   It has been emphasised to us by the Public Trustee that theclients of his office are already suffering as a result of thepresent uncertainty, and we are convinced that further delay in reaching a decision would be even more disadvantageous tobeneficiaries of trusts at present under administration.     Wetherefore strongly recommend that the Government should take its decision on our recommendations and announce its intentions withoutfurther delay, although we recognise that it may not be possible tobring forward the necessary legislation immediately.     The public trustee will then be able to make potential clients aware of theGovernment&apos;s intentions, and, at the same time, the preparationswe have suggested for the offer of an opportunity for transfer canbe commenced at once, thus reducing to a minimum the steps to betaken after the legislation has been passed.     In the meantime, the merger of the Public Trustee Office with the Official Solicitor&apos;department should proceed, and the staff of both offices be fully informed of the implications of the new structure.26.   Since our recommendations will lead to considerable change inthe shape and scale of the Public Trustee Office, we have not givendetailed consideration to those parts of our terms of referencewhich presuppose its continued existence in its present form.     Wewould, however, note that none of the witnesses we heard pressedany justification for subsidising the work of the Office.     we ourselves are so convinced of the adequacy of the alternative facilitiesthat we would not advocate any form of subsidy.     We accordingly recommend no change in the financial duty of the Public Trustee tocover his outgoings with his income from fees and charges.     We madea brief examination of the present organization of the Office but thought it best, in ttie context of our main recommendations, to limitourselves merely to noting that the Public Trustee himself is concerned
that the present system of three divisions in the Office was established more than fifty years ago and is not well adapted to modern working methods.     It is our opinion that a functional and efficient structure for the work can only be adequately devised afterthe fundamental changes we have proposed have been completed, whenthe resultant scope and volume of remaining work has been determined.SUMMARY   OF   recommendations i.        The Public Trustee Office should be merged withthe Official Solicitor&apos;s Department.     Considera-tion should be given to transferring to the mergeddepartment the bona vacantia work at presentundertaken by the Treasury Solicitor.    (Paragraph22).ii.        Legislation should be introduced at the earliestpossible moment to relieve the Public Trustee fromthe duty of accepting new business;   there are various additional points which such an Act would need to cover (paragraph 19 and Appendix 2).iii.        settlers or beneficiaries of existing trustsshould be approached and offered the opportunityto accept transfer to another trustee, free ofall expense to the trust and themselves (paragraph20).iv.        Original Wills deposited in the strongroom of thePublic Trustee should be returned, together with a standard form of codicil for the appointment of anew executor or trustee, to the testator or solicitorwho deposited them (paragraph 21).
v.        The Lord Chancellor&apos;s Office should establish a special unit within the new merged department,responsible for ensuring that these processes are carried out on schedule (paragraph 24).vi.        Immediate consideration should be given to theestablishment of the investment managementdivision as an entirely separate investmentmanagement unit for funds in the public sector,under an independent Board of Management(paragraph 23).

APPENDIX 2LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONSThere are five Acts known to us in which the Public Trustee isnamed:-Public Trustee Act 1906Public Trustee (General Deposit Fund) Act 1939Settled Land Act 1925Law of Property Act 1925Administration of Justice Act 1965The following main amendments would be required to the public trustee Act 1906.i.        The Public Trustee should be relieved of the dutyof taking on new business, as from a specified date.ii.        In connection with the transfer of existing trusts,power should be taken for the Public Trustee to waiveall withdrawal fees, and for any other expenses aris-ing directly out of the transfer to be paid out ofpublic funds.iii.        Section 9 of the Act empowers the Public Trustee to charge such fees as may be fixed by the Treasurywith the sanction of the Lord Chancellor.     At present this places the Public Trustee in the unique positionof being able to charge for his services without theneed for a charging clause in the Will or trust in-instrument.     We recommend that the new legislation should include a provision enabling all professionalor corporate trustees to charge for their serviceswhether or not the trust instrument or Will includes a charging clause.     This provision should also be suchas to ensure that solicitors and other non-corporatetrustees are in no worse position as regards re-muneration than a corporate trustee.
iv.        Section 3 of the Act empowers the Public Trusteeto act in the administration of estates of smallvalue, as an alternative to administration by theCourt.     We understand that the existing powers under this section have not been invoked with anyfrequency since 1920, and not at all since 1954-Although one or two witnesses here suggested thatthis is due to the restrictive nature of section 3,we do not believe that a sufficient case has beenmade out for retention of this provision, whichshould therefore be repealed.v.        Section 13 of the Act makes provision for the investigation and audit of trust accounts, under certain conditions, by the Public Trustee or some person appointed by him.     We understand that thisprovision has been invoked only very occasionally,and therefore see no reason for its retention.The Administration of Justice Act 1965 empowers the Lord chancellor to establish schemes for common investment funds, under the management and control of the Public Trustee, for the investment of Funds in Court.Amendment would therefore be required if the management of these fundsis to pass to a new independent investment management unit such as weenvisage.We envisage that the Public Trustee&apos;^ responsibilities under thetwo 1925 Acts should pass to the new Official Solicitor and TrusteeDepartment.
