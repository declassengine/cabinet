MIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 42 COPY NO C 017 April, 1972CABINETBRITISH STEEL CORPORATION:  LONG-TERM review memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. The result of the review of the long-term financial position anddevelopment plans of the British Steel Corporation (BSC) was reportedto the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy and the Committeesubsequently considered a revised draft of a Parliamentary statement.The Prime Minister has asked that the proposed statement should beconsidered by the Cabinet and a further revise is attached,,2,        The main point emerging from the review is the recommendation that the BSC should aim at productive capacity in 1980 in the range28-36 million ingot tons.    This is v/ell below the target of 43 million tons in 1980 contained in the bsc&apos;s development plan of February 1971,although in the bsc&apos;s annual report last summer the target had alreadybeen modified to 40 million tons or so in 1980 or soon after0   It may thus be seen as a reduction in the future size of the industry.3.        However, the recommended range is based on a realistic assessment of future sales possibilities made in association with the BSC itself.    Itallows for a growth in the home market at 3f per cent a year up to 1980(although at present home sales are actually lower than they were in 1965),and for substantial exports.    Our consultants have warned that a highercapacity would mean seeking further export sales likely to be possible only at uneconomic prices, and could adversely affect home market prices.The result would be costly.    The industry is unprofitable now; accumulatedlosses are likely to be about  230 million by March 1973, and the prospectis no better than for breaking even by the mid-1970s.   It is vital to restoreprofitability, and it would be rash to commit yet more resources (of theorder of another  1, 000 million) to create capacity which could be utilisedonly at a loss.    Moreover excess capacity could have serious local employment results if, as could well happen, it led to the closure of major existing plants.    It should be noted that steel industries in othercountries are similarly modifying their development plans.4.        This is not a plan to cut back the industry.    Investment is recommended at  200- 280 million a year (1971 Survey prices) throughoutthe rest of this decade, compared with just over  100 million a year at the
same prices from 1965 to 1969.    This is a large share of our resources and, bearing in mind the consequences of excess capacity referred toabove, we must make sure of soundly based decisions0    It is a questionof timing the growth to achieve the best balance between capacity and demand.    Some flexibility will remain to increase or slow down thebuilding programme and also to vary the timing of the 12 million tonsof closures expected up to 1980.    But the major decisions are c :nmitmentsfor years ahead.5. We must not try to prejudge the right level within the recommendedrange until the BSC has completed its detailed assessment later this summer.    We shall then have to consider very carefully what the generalobjective of the industry should be.    Our consultants and independentadvisers say that if maximum profitability were the only consideration a capacity even lower than the recommended range might be desirable,but we must also consider balance of payments and regional employmenteffects, and the BSC itself inclines to the upper end of the range.6.        Although the proposed statement makes clear that substantivedecisions on the long-term prospects of the industry and the case fira major new development cannot be taken till later in the year, I cannotdelay making a statement now.    The decision to undertake a long-termreview was announced to the House, and there is considerable constituencyand public interest; I have repeatedly promised a statement and the SelectCommittee are now starting an investigation of the BSC.    Nevertheless itis essential that we maintain our freedom to give full consideration to thevarious options possible within the recommended range.7,        I accordingly invite my colleagues to agree that the Minister for industry should make a statement on the lines of the attached draft as soonas possible.J d department of Trade and Industry17 April 1972
PARLIAMENTARY STATEMENT ON JSG21 The joint Steering Group on the steel industry composed as theHouse will recall of representatives both of Departments and of the bsc has submitted its second report on the future of the industry.2      Its work has been undertaken during a period when less opti-mistic assessments were being .made, throughout the world, of future steel markets and forward investment plans were consequentlybeing reduced, although confidence in the long term trend of steelconsumption is still maintained.   These circumstances have been assessed for the Government by external consultants as to theirimpact on future British steel outlets quite separately from thej _ ,judgments reached in the JSG.3      The conclusion reached as a result of this careful review bythe Joint Steering Group, in which of course the BSC has participatedat all stages, is that the capacity levels to which the british steel Corporation should aim by the end of the decade should be within the bracket of 28m to 36m ingot tons.h -   The Government and BSC accept this revised capacity targetwhich is now being taken into account by the BSC in its further work on its long-term programme for modernisation and expansion.The Corporation is carrying out this work urgently and expects tobe able to complete it and to make firm strategic recommendations by the summer.   The Government will of course be closely involvedin the decisions, particularly the extent and&quot;siting of any majorsteel developments to come into production by 1980 and we shall &quot;have regional policy factors much in mind.5      Meanwhile the work undertaken has enabled other investment tobe proceeded with at a high level.   As the House knows, the BSChas my approval to invest in the current financial year some  265mat 1971 survey prices&apos;- compared with about  80m as recently as inthe year from April 1969&apos;.    In addition, to ensure continuity ofthe present high momentum of investment I am now giving provisional approval for  200m to be committed against the 1973/7U programme.- 1 -CONFIDENTIAL/Any&apos; further
Any further investment required to implement decisions arising fromthe bsc&apos;s long term plans will be additional to this sum.-6       Investment in development of the main existing plants over theperiod 1970/71 - 1973/7^ is planned to reach the following approximatelevels: m-Llanwern 90Port Talbot k5Scunthorpe (including ImminghamHarbour) 250South Teesside 130Ravenscraig 55- -This expenditure at principal plants is in addition to substantialprogrammes of development elsewhere.r -7      Finally, the House will be glad to know that satisfactory progress is being made with the introduction of arrangements firstfor regular reporting by the Corporation of performance againstplans;    and secondly for the submission of investment proposals and sufficient supporting data to enable the Government to reach firmconclusions on the bsc&apos;s investment plans.   These will help to clarify the responsibilities of Government and Corporation in this area.    In the meantime, considerable progress is being made by the bsc in its drive towards greater efficiency.
