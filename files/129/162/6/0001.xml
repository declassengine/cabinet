THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 313 March 1972RAIL DISPUTE:  USE OF POWERS in industrial RELATIONS act memorandum by the Secretary of State for EmploymentPOSSIBILITIES OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION1.        If British Rail (BR) cannot get a settlement on 7-8 March the aim is to avoid a complete breakdown with a view tc resumed negotiationsearly in the following week.2. A complete breakdown on 8 March is unlikely, but there arenevertheless three possibilities of industrial action at that point: -(i)    Immediate sporadic unofficial action, either a go-slowor strike, by militant Associated Society of locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) branches.(ii)   Notice by ASLEF of an official strike to start shortly after the resumed talks or at some later date, conceivablyafter Easter, if the resumed talks do not produce asettlement satisfactory to them.(iii)    Notice as in (ii) but of action short of a full strike.This could take various forms such as an overtime banor blacking of certain cargoes like oil and coal.It is unlikely that the other two unions would join ASLEF in action ornotice of action on 8 March.    It is also unlikely that ASLEF would giveless than a week&apos;s notice;   to do so would put them at risk under theAct.3.        If there is no official action before the resumed talks but thesebreak down in the following week the same possibilities would recurwith a stronger likelihood of notice of full strike action by ASLEF.There would be more chance of the other two unions supporting thembut it would still be probable that they would stop short of full strike action.COPY NO62CABINET
EMERGENCY POWERS UNDER THE ACT4. I can apply to the Industrial Court for two kinds of order;  in either case the Court roust be satisfied that emergency conditions existas defined in the Act:-(i)   Cooling-off orderI can apply for an order restraining named organisations or individuals from taking or continuing industrial action, orthreatening to do so, for a maximum of 60 days, if it appearsto me that this would be conducive to a settlement.(ii)   Ballot orderI can apply for an order directing a ballot to be held andrestraining industrial action pending a ballot where itappears to me that there is doubt whether the workers concerned support the industrial action and have had anopportunity to express their wishes.    The ballot issimply a means of testing opinion and its re&amp;ult is in no way binding.5.        A ballot order is unlikely to help in the present dispute.    Thesigns are that the membership is at least as militant as the leadership,particularly in ASLEF, and a ballet might well produce a majority insupport of industrial action.6.        A cooling-off order if effective would buy valuable time to buildup stocks in power stations.    There would be political pressures for it.I would have preferred to avoid its use so early in the life of the Act.There is a risk, perhaps small, of deliberate defiance by ASLEF and agreater risk that the order would be rendered ineffective by&quot;spontaneous&quot; unofficial action which could not be restrained under theAct.    This would tend to bring the whole of the Act into disrepute.7. Nevertheless, I would be inclined to use the power in thecircumstances which may face us provided we could reasonablydemonstrate why we believed that a cooling-off period would be conductive to a settlement - eg by pointing to the willingness of BR to continue talks,the continued availability of arbitration.    The more precipitate theindustrial action the more this proviso would be met.8. I ought to point out that it is just possible that if my applicationwere challenged, I could be required to give evidence in person and besubject to cross-examination.2
9. I do not think we should seek an order before negotiations havefinally broken down.    We should also be chary of doing so if what is threatened is action short of a full strike.(a) Official Strike Action10.       If we are faced with official strike action, whether by ASLEF orby all the unions, to take place within a short period after the breakdown of resumed negotiations in the week beginning 13 March, I would then be inclined to seek an order.    If there should be an earlier breakdown,though this seems unlikely, there would be   even more reason to seek anorder.11. Action after the order would be further negotiations between theparties with conciliation if necessary. Resort to arbitration could notbe ruled out.    Public opinion could be t-ought to bear.(b) Unoffic ial A c tion12.       There would be great difficulties in seeking a cooling-off orderto deal with unofficial action.    The action would have to be sufficientlyextensive to constitute an emergency as defined in the Act (&quot;gravelyinjurious to the national economy&quot;).    It might be difficult or impossibleto name the individuals responsible for inducing the action.    Even ifthese difficulties could be met, unofficial action might continue&quot;spontaneously&quot; and making the order might escalate it.OTHER POWERS UNDER THE ACT13        If ASLEF or the National Union of Railwaymen, neither of whichis registered, or any unofficial leaders induce a strike without duenotice or induce other industrial action which involves a breach ofworkers1 contracts of employment, they would be committing an unfairpractice under Section 96 of the Act.    It would then be open to BR to seek a restraining order from the Industrial Court and, if they chose,compensation from those responsible.    An order restraining strike action would, however, be unlikely to be effective for more than a weeksince the strike could be legitimised by a week&apos;s notice.    There wouldbe e. great risk of escalation of industrial action and triggering off ofsympathetic action by other unions.14.       Similar redress would be open to other employers affected bysympathetic action by other unions if these were unregistered.    Forexample a road haulage connector or an oil company might be able totake action against the Transport and General Workers1 Union if thelatter instructed their drivers not to deliver supplies to power stations and if this involved the drivers in breach of their contracts of employ -ment.    But in such a situation the Central Electricity Generating Boardcould not take action unless they were themselves the employers of thedrivers.    There would be the same risk of escalation as in action by BR.
*5Pf I?FTCONCLUSION15.       We should be ready to seek a cooling-off order if we are facedwith official strike action and we can demonstrate that the order wouldbe conducive to a settlement.RCDepartment of employment March 1972V4
