FIRST REPORT ON TOP PUBLIC SERVANTS BYTHE TOP SALARIES REVIEW BODYMemorandum by the Lord Privy seal i attach a copy of the First Report by Lord Boyle&apos;s top salaries Review Body  (TSRB)  on the pay of the Higher Civil Service,Senior Armed Service Officers,  Higher Judiciary and nationalised industry Boards  (Top Public Servants).    We must decide how to dealwith the recommendations in the light of our public undertaking toaccept them in the absence of clear and compelling reasons for not doing so.SUMMARY2.      The recommendations&apos; are set out in convenient tables inparagraphs 26 and 27  (pages 11 and 12) of the Report.    They are for increases with effect from 1 January 1972 at an annual compoundrate since 1 July 1969 of 6.8% on average;  8.4% at the bottom and3.9% at the top.    Because they follow the first substantive reviewsince mid-1969,  they involve cash increases of  1,000- 2,500, andpercentage increases averaging 17-9^ and ranging from 22.2% at the bottom to 10% at the top.    These are interim recommendations to befollowed by a review in depth of each group.-BACKGROUND3.      The Higher Civil Service (Under Secretaries and above) were previously dealt with by the Standing Committee on the Pay of theHigher Civil Service  (chaired in recent years by Lord Plowden).Our predecessors referred the pay of both the Chairmen and boards of nationalised industries and the whole of the Armed Services,including senior officers, to the NBPI, while the Higher Judiciary(defined for this purpose as Metropolitan Magistrates and above)were dealt with less systematically in the light of the salarychanges of the lower judiciary and,  in^recent years,  of the higher civil Service.    The last substantive increases for the Higher CivilService and nationalised industry boards were recommended in and related to the circumstances of 1969 but were paid in three stages.The stages applied to senior Service Officers and the Higher Judiciawere different in detail, but they too were brought up to the 1969level on 1 January 1971-     (The most senior members of the civilianand Armed Service groups concerned voluntarily delayed receipt ofthe final stage from 1 January 1971 to 1 July).
4.      The establishment of the three salary Review Bodies was announced in the House on 2 November 1970 and they began work inthe middle of last year.    The TSRB reported on Ministers and MPsin December 1971  and is about to report on MPs and Ministers ofthe Northern Ireland Government.    The Armed Forces Review Body(chaired by Mr Atcherley) is about to present a report recommendingincreases of about  10-11$ in Service pay.    The Doctors and DentistsReview Body (chaired by Lord Halsbury)  recommended interim increases of 8% with effect from 1 April 1971 and is well advanced in preparing a substantive report to take effect from 1 April 1972.CONSEQUENTIALS5.      Direct consequentials are limited and can be applied quickly.Departments have agreed that,  in accordance with previous practice,the salaries of minor nationalised industry boards and other publicboards  (including the Civil Aviation Authority) will be reviewedinterdepartmentally in the light of recommendations for the mainboards but without the use of an automatic formula.    No announcementsneed be made.    The pay of some of the lower judiciary and of the mostsenior staff in a few organisations including the NHS,  Atomic energy authority and New Town Corporations are linked to the Higher CivilService,  but here again no significant problems should arise.    Itwas agreed last year that the pay of Assistant Secretaries would be reviewed in the light of this TSRB Report.    Little or no publicityneed be given to this operation.    More generally,  the recommendedincreases will no doubt be referred to in negotiations and arbitration for various &quot;highly paid groups such as top local authorityofficers.    Counterarguments are strong and direct repercussionsshould be very limited.EFFECTIVE DATE6.      The TSRB recommend that all the increases should be effective from 1 January 1972.    This is an appropriate date but presentsdifficulties in the case of the Higher Judiciary because their pay(with the exception of Circuit Judges) can be increased only by affirmative Resolution and the relevant Act does not provide forbackdating.    If we move quickly,  it should be possible for the judges&apos;  increases to be effective from 1 April,  or at the worst1 May.    We shall need to give further consideration to how to dealwith this problem in future years;  but in the light of the factthat the    Judges have not been precisely aligned with the other groups in the past,  it would appear reasonable to accept 1 Januaryfor the other groups and to implement the increases for Judges assoon as possible by laying the orders needed for the judiciary at thefirst possible opportunity.PRESENTATION7.      There will clearly be a high risk of adverse publicity directedboth at the cash increases and the total percentage increases.    Wemust seek to emphasise&quot;the moderate rate of increase since the 1969reviews; the fact that the recommendations have been made by thedistinguished outside body set up to deal with what is generally recognised as a difficult area;  and the moderation of therecommendations in the light of the outside salary situation.
mmmt8.      It will   soon bo widely known that the Report has been made and there will be severe risks of leaks highlighting,  for example,the large percentage increases at the bottom.    While there arealways general arguments for delaying the publication of such areport,  I think there would therefore be major advantages in asealy an announcement as possible.    We should,  however,  seek toavoid a direct conflict between the announcement and the tacticalhandling of specific current negotiations,  particularly BritishRail&apos;s.9.      We shall need to consider whether a Parliamentary statement should be made at the same time as the Report is published.    an oral Question answered by the Prime Minister would appear to bethe best technique:  anything less might appear to be dodging theissue, while a more formal statement could be an awkward precedent in future when, we may hope,  the   temperature   on pay matters islower.    Wednesday 29 March or Maundy Thursday 30 March would appearto be the. earliest practicable dates,  and the risks of criticism if we appear to be trying to bury the announcement on Thursdaywould make Wednesday the preferred date.    This timing would ofcourse be jeopardised if we defer the final Cabinet decisionbeyond Tuesday 28 March.10.    I understand that Lord Boyle may wish to hold a press conference himself.CONCLUSION11.    In the light of the extreme sensitivity of this issue,  i will present my conclusions orally to my colleagues.J.Civil Service DepartmentLondon,  SW122 March 1972

INTERIM REPORT ON TOP SALARIESCHAPTER 1 - introduction.    We were appointed in May 1971 as an independent Review Body, and were giventhe following terms of references&quot;To advise the Prime Minister on the remuneration of the Chairmen and membersof the Boards of nationalised industries; the higher judiciary; senior civilservants; senior officers of the armed forces, and other groups which may bereferred to it&quot;.We were asked to begin our first review of these groups in 1971? and to undertakefuture reviews normally at intervals of two years.   Shortly after our appointment,and as a matter of priority, we were asked to undertake a review of the remuneration of Ministers of the Crown and Members of Parliament, and our first report was therefore concerned with that remit.^   This is our second report, andthe first occasion on which we review the remuneration of the four groups coveredby our standing reference.2.    Our terms of reference cover a wide field and many different types ofresponsibility.   Each group has a different hierarchy, and de facto relationshipshave evolved between their respective pay structures.   Over a period of timesome of these horizontal relativities have become generally accepted, although they do not result from any measured evaluation of responsibilities.   Ourenquiries on this occasion have convinced us that further study of each group isessential, both to ensure that salary levels are adequate, and to test the pattern of relativities within and between groups.   We have begun to collectevidence for a review in depth of, each group, which we intend to complete withina year.   In that review, we shall also give further consideration to theprinciples governing the pay of those covered by our terms of reference.Review Body on Top Salaries, First Report, Ministers of the Crown and Members ofParliament: Cmnd 4836, December 1971.1
confidential.    Meanwhile, to prevent their remuneration from falling too far behind those -in comparable occupation outside the public service, we have considered and now recommended interim pay increases for.the main levels in each group; we envisage thatconsequential adjustments will be made for the remainder in each group.   We have con-sidered the salaries of Chairmen and full-time members of the Boards of the principalnationalised industries, and our recommendations are intended to set the pattern forthe Chairmen and members of certain other public corporations and Boards&quot;&apos;&apos;. We have2considered the main appointments in the Higher Judiciary *   We have not consideredposts in the Lower Judiciary, some of which have firm pay links with the LegalClass in the civil service, and we envisage that consequential adjustments willbe made where appropriate in the light of our recommendations.   Our remit on thecivil service relates to the senior grades of the Higher Civil Service, and wehave considered the position of the Under Secretary, the Deputy Secretary and thePermanent Secretary.   The pay of the Assistant Secretary is within the civilservice negotiating machinery.   Our remit on senior officers of the armed forcesrelates to the ranks of Rear Admiral, Major-General, Air Vice Marshal and above.The Armed Forces Pay Review Body, with which we have linked membership,is responsiblefor recommendations on the pay of the remainder of the armed forces.4.    The last review of the remuneration of Chairmen and members of the Boards of nationalised industries was carried out a,s part of a general study of top salaries in industry, by the former National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI) in 1969^this included a detailed survey by questionnaire of pay and responsibilities in twelvenationalised undertakings, and in a sample of about one hundred companies in theprivate sector, covering the whole &quot;remuneration package&quot;, including pensions andfringe benefits. In addition, with the help of management consultants, seniorexecutives in both the public and private sectors were interviewed personally,inorder   to amplify the information on levels of responsibility.   A second assignmentwas carried out by consultants, in which a system of job evaluation was applied in four nationalised industries^, and the results related to a survey of firms in theprivate sector carried out by the same consultants.   The Government of the dayaccepted the recommendations for substantially increased salary levels,but these were..........^-1-,-j............ -NBPI Report No 107, Top Salaries in the Private Sector and Nationalised Industries,Cmnd 3970, of March 1969 included the British Airports Authority, the british transport Docks Board, the UK Atomic Energy Authority, Cable and Wireless Ltd andRemploy Ltd, as having close links with, or certain similarities to, the mainnationalised industries.we have also made recommendations for Circuit Judges as we were invited to do,and for Metropolitan Magistrates.

CONFIDENTIALimplemented in three stages: the first two from 1 April 19&amp;9 and 1 April 1970;the third, which was planned to take effect from 1 April 1971* was brought forward to 1 January 1971 for members only.   The increase due at the final stage was further deferred to 1 July 1971 for the highest levels in each of the four groupswithin our terms of reference (including both Chairmen and Deputy Chairmen of nationalised industry Boards), in response to offers by them to forgo it, in thenational interest, for that period.   The present salary structure is at appendix A.5.    The last review of the remuneration of the senior grades in the Higher CivilService was carried out in 1969 by the Standing Advisory Committee on the Pay ofthe Higher Civil Service (under the chairmanship of Lord Plowden).   The Committeedrew on information in the NBPI&apos;s Report on Top Salaries, which it supplemented by enquiries of its own, including a special investigation by management consultants into relative levels of responsibility, using job evaluation methods which they had already developed for use in industry.   The Committee found theexisting rates of pay for the senior grades in the Higher Civil Service to be seriously out of line with the salaries paid for comparable levels of responsibility in industry and commerce, and recommended substantial increases.   The Committeeexpressed the hope that the increases would be implemented, with as little delayas possible, but recognised that incomes policy considerations at that time might cause the Government to defer implementation in full and, to meet this situation,proposed &quot;with considerable reluctance&quot; implementation in three stages.   The first stage was put into effect from 1 July 1969.   In its tenth report, submitted to thePrime Minister in June 1970* &quot;the Committee recommended adjustment of the second stage increase for Under Secretaries, to take account of a recently negotiatedcentral pay increase which had reduced the differential between the assistant secretary and the Under Secretary.   The second stage increases   proposed by theCommittee, including the adjustment of the Under Secretary rate, were implementedwith effect from 1 July 1970, and the third stage was introduced with effect from1 January 1971 (except for Permanent Secretaries, who had accepted six months1further postponement - see paragraph 4 above).   The present salary structure isat Appendix B. /6.    In recent years, the remuneration of the lower judiciary has moved broadly in line with salaries in the civil service.   In some cases, the links are firm and salaries have been adjusted consequentially either with each of the three stages of the increases for the senior grades in the Higher Civil Service or, where the links are at lower levels, with increases in the civil service at those levels.In those cases where lower judiciary salaries required Parliamentary authority,salaries were increased from 1 July 1969* with a combined second and third stagepayment from 1 January 1971*   There are no similar links between the higher judiciary
confidential and the civil service, and the last salary increase was paid in two stages, from29 May 1970 and 1 July 1971 (voluntarily deferred from 1 January 1971).   In fact,the salaries of the High Court Judge and the Permanent Secretary are currentlythe same.   The present salary structure is at Appendix C.7,    The last review of the pay of senior officers in the armed forces was carriedout by the KEPI in 19701, at the invitation of the Government following thedecision to implement the recommendations in the ninth and tenth reports of theStanding Advisory Committee for the senior grades of the Higher Civil Service(paragraph 5 above).   The NBPI conducted its review on the basis that the termsof reference on that occasion effectively required pay levels to be assessed by comparison with the civil service, rather than on internal vertical relativitiesor other considerations.   This is a matter which we shall examine in greater depthin our next review, as part of our consideration of the principles governing pay.For our present purpose, we have taken account of the fact that the NBPI recommendedthat the salary of the Chief of Defence Staff,: including his existing level ofresponsibility allowance, should be equal to the salary of the Permanent Secretary,Head of the Home Civil Service.   The recommendations for Admirals, Generals, AirChief Marshals and below were not based on exact parity with the equivalent levels inthe civil service, but had regard to the broad magnitude of the recent increases,as well as to the maintenance of an appropriate structure of differentials at thehigher levels of the armed forces.   The recommendations were implemented with effect from 1 January 1971, subject to voluntary postponement to 1 July 1971 forAdmirals, Generals, Air Chief Marshals and above.   The present salary structureis at Appendix D.NHPI Report No 157, Standing Reference on the Pay of the Armed Forces, fouth report: the Pay of Senior Officers, Cmnd 4513, December 1970.
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 2 - THE CASE FOR AN INTERIM REVIEW8.    Although the last instalment of the increases proposed for each of the fourgroups was only implemented from 1 January 1971 (or, by voluntary deferment,from 1 July 1971), all the present salary levels in fact derive, directly or indirectly, from comparisons with outside rates in mid-1969.   Directcomparisons were made between the responsibilities of the Chairmen and board members of the nationalised industries and those in outside industry, and between the senior grades of the Higher Civil Service and outside industry,and the pay levels of each group were assessed on the results.   For the judiciary and the senior officers of the armed forces, however, direct outsidecomparisons were not made: their present pay levels are based, for the judiciaryat least in part, on the maintenance of existing general relativities with thecivil service.   We are not satisfied that this is an appropriate way to settlepay in these two groups.   We do not, however, consider it practicable as partof an interim review to reach firm conclusions on the most suitable yardstickfor assessing their pay in the longer term.   We shall consider this further in the course of our next review.   Meanwhile, we have taken as our starting point the fact that the present salary levels were considered to reflectoutside rates -prevailing in mid-1969.9.    There have been substantial increases in wages and salaries generallysince mid-1969, and especially from the beginning of 1970 to mid-1971.Salaries have risen by about 29 per cent (July 1969 to December 1971) and prices by about 20 per cent (July I969 to January 1972).   We have found clear evidence, from various surveys including our own, that salaries at the highestlevels have risen less rapidly, and may have risen little more than prices since1 July 1969.10.   Within the public service, salaries of some management grades immediatelybelow the levels with which we are concerned are negotiated and, since mid-1969jhave reflected the general steep rise in earnings outside for comparable work.As a result, differentials between the top salaries and those at senior levelsbelow have been compressed.   This problem is particularly acute in the nationalised industries and in the Higher Civil Service.   We accept the need for adequatedifferentials, and we recognise that negotiated decisions will continue to have a bearing on our recommendations.   But we consider it important that our freedom to form our own judgments should not be undermined by decisions taken elsewhere.
11.    In the nationalised industries, differentials have been seriously-eroded, and we have been told that, in some instances, they have been extinguishedbetween Board level and the senior executives immediately below: this is confirmed by information from our own salaries1 survey .   The problem of compression isparticularly urgent, because of the difficulty of recruiting and retainingsenior executives; it is also important to provide adequate remuneration c&apos;n promotion to Board membership.   The position is exacerbated by the present general practiceof restricting Board members1 salaries to the lower half of the existing ranges,and we consider that full and flexible use of the ranges should be made withoutdelay by the Ministers and Chairmen concerned.12.    In the civil service, the differential between the Assistant Secretary andthe Under Secretary has been reduced from  1,550 (regarded as appropriate in mid-1969) to  450 from 1 January 1971* and would be narrowed still further bythe application of the recently agreed central pay increase effective from1 January 1972.   We were told that the need to maintain some differential to accommodate intermediate pay levels was the overriding factor in determining the1 January 1971 scale maximum for the Assistant Secretary.   Whilst we do not suggestthat the salary of the Under Secretary should be rigidly governed by thepreservation of a fixed lead over the Assistant secretary scale maximum either in cash or percentage terms, nonetheless we consider that a significant lead isessential to maintain a sensible structure.13.    Differentials between senior officers in the Armed Forces, and thoseimmediately below have also been reduced, and would contract further on completionof the general review of pay below the highest levels if no adjustmentwere made.   We have also been told of a growing problem of maintaining a reasonablerelationship between the remuneration of the judiciary and earnings at the Bar.14.    As we have said, in I969 the pay of Chairmen and members of the nationalised industry Boards and of the senior grades of the Higher Civil Service was found tobe seriously out of line with earnings in the private sector, and significantincreases were recommended.   Comparable increases were extended to the seniorSee Appendix E: OME  Salaries Survey 1972, Table 1.6
7officers of the armed forces and the judiciary.   However, in the period of over two and a half years which has elapsed, outside earnings have risen rapidly,with the result that the pay of each public service group with which we areconcerned has again fallen substantially behind earnings in the private sector,and compression, in some cases acute, has resulted.   Serving members of these groups have therefore, been less favourably treated than people at comparablelevels in the private sector,and than those immediately below them in thepublic service.15,   Moreover, because pensions and other retirement benefits are calculated asa proportion of final salary, or salary over a final period of years, delay inthe implementation of justified increases causes a lasting reduction in the pension benefits of those retiring in the period affected.   We regard this asparticularly serious.16.   For all these reasons, we consider that there is an urgent need, now an interim increase in salaries in the groups with which we are concerned.   We makedetailed recommendations in Chapter 4*17.   In present circumstances, because of the existing de facto relationships between the different groups with which we are concerned in the public service,we see it as convenient for their pay movements to take place at the same time.We consider that, at any rate for the present interim review, our recommendations should take effect from the common operative date of 1 January 1972.18.   While we are in principle opposed to retrospective pay increases, we regard the limited measure of backdating recommended as justified in relation to the outside comparisons we have made.   We were asked to give priority to our reviewconcerning Ministers of the Crown and Members of Parliament: this resulted insome deferment of our deliberations on our present remit.   Moreover, for thecivil service, our proposal brings the senior grades of the Higher Civil Serviceinto line with the effective date of pay reviews for the Assistant Secretary, and gives the new Administration Group as a whole a common operative date.  We would nevertheless stress that we do not necessarily regard a single operative date for the whole top salaries field as appropriate for future reviews.
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER 3 - OUR APPROACH TO OUR TASK19-  In order to inform   ourselves for our main task, we have already taken evidence from Ministers, from Chairmen of the main nationalised industries, from GovernmentDepartments, from the Staff Side of the Civil Service National Whitley Council,from the British Medical Association, and from serving and former members of theHigher Civil Service, the armed forces and the judiciary.   Whilst some of thisevidence has had a bearing on our interim review, the greater part of it will be directly relevant to our forthcoming substantive review.   For our immediatepurpose, we have been concerned to establish the degree of movement that has taker,place in top salaries since 1 July 1969, the date at which the present salarylevels were last compared with pay in the private sector.20.   in the absence of detailed statistics on the earnings of top management inthe private sector, apart from consultants surveys related to a limited number ofcustomer companies, we have carried out a survey of over 250 large undertakings to collect salary information since September 1968, on similar lines to the statisticalsurvey carried out by the NBPI at that time.   The following table compares theaverage salaries in the public and private sectors which result from our survey.TABLE AAverage salaries^(including bonus, commission and profit-sharing) of topmanagement: September 1971Sector of industry and size of undertaking	Chairman	Deputy Chairman	Board membersNationalised industries	 	 	 Group A B c	20,600 17,000 11,600	17,400(3) (13,500)^ 8,600	12,300 10,300( j 7,500wPrivate sector			Commercial &amp; industrial Capital employed:  250M and over^      (^  100M but under  250M^y  10M but under  100M1- &apos; Under  10M				43,100 30,900 20,000 12,100	2^,800 24,300 14,600 11,300	18,800 16,000 11,100 8,300Financial	27,200	19,600	15,300Notes:   (l)   The figures reflect a wide range of salaries.(2)   The size categories of these undertakings in the private sectorcorrespond broadly to the grouping used for the nationalised industries.(3)   The present rate for full-time Deputy Chairmen: only one was paid at this level at the time of the survey.(4)   Salaries are paid in respect of full-time executive appointmentsonly*       CONFIDENTIAL

The following table summarises movements in the salaries of top management in the private sector.TABLE BPercentage movements in annual average salaries (including bonus, commission andprof it-sharing) of top management by -posts held: September 1968-71	Percentage changes (September)				1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1968-71		%		%Chairmen	4.3	7.0	4.4	16.5Deputy Chairmen	7.0	6.1	6.0	20.4Main Board members	8.3	10.0	8.5	29.222.   Examination of movements in the salaries of top management in the private sector by salary level also reveals a smaller increase in the highest salaries:our analysis shows common movement in four broad ranges, as follows:TABLE CPercentage movements in annual average salaries (including bonus, commission andprofit-sharing) of top management by salary range: September 1968-71	Percentage changes (September)	Salary range (September 1970)	1969^71	1968-71	%	$ 30,000 and over	6.7	14.7 14,000 to  29,999	16.6	24.7  8,000 to  13,999	20.5	30.under  8,000	23.7	34.7Total	18.8 1 *            /	28.2The evidence summarised in both tables B and C in our view confirms that increasesat the highest salary levels in recent years have been smaller in percentage terms than those in the rest of the top salaries field.   The longer term effectof this trend requires further study.   The detailed results of our survey arein Appendix E.
23.  We are concerned to establish the movement in salaries between 1 July1969 and 1 January 1972, which we have recommended as the common operative date for our interim recommendations.   This is a period of two and a half years and,if we adopt the same basis as was used in 1969 both by the NBPI and by theStanding Advisory Committee for the Higher Civil Service, we may assume thatthe overall increase for the period lies somewhere between 18.8 per cent and28.2 per cent.   These rates may be compared with increases of 20.4 per cent inprices, and 28.9 per cent in salaries over the two and a half year period from July 1969.24.  We have not sought to preserve the external relativities with the private sector implied in the proposals in the last substantive reviews for chairmen and Board members of nationalised industries, and for the senior grades of theHigher Civil Service: we shall examine these aspects more fully in our nextreview.   In the meantime, our primary concern is to bring pay in our fieldmore nearly up to date by broad comparison with outside salary movements sincemid-1969.10
CHAPTER 4 - RECOIvMMDATIONS25,    In making our recommendations, we have given due consideration to all the factors mentioned above, which we believe to be relevant to our interim review.We have also given full weight to the importance which the Government attaches to the containment of wage and salary increases, and we have been conscious tooof its declared intention to implement our proposals unless there are clear andcompelling reasons for not doing so.   We have noted the movements in pay atsenior levels in the private sector.   We have taken account of the central pay increase recently negotiated for grades up to Senior Principal in theAdministration Group of the civil service, which we understand would normally be extended to the Assistant Secretary in the Higher Civil Service.   We havealso had regard to the reviews now being carried out by the Armed Forces PayReview Body and the Doctors and Dentists Review Body which have implications for the senior ranks of the armed forces&quot;&apos;&apos;.26. We recommend that the following annual salaries should be paid with effect from 1 January, 1972:a.

On an annual compound basis since 1 July 1969. these recommendations amountto an overall average increase of 6.8 per cent, with a range from 3.9 per cent for the highest salaries to 8.4 per cent for the lowest.   On the same basis, theupsurge of inflation during this period has increased prices by 7*7 per cent ayear, while average salaries have risen by 11,1 per cent a year.   We are therefore in no doubt that the interim increases we recommend are the minimum required ifconfidence in fair treatment for the public service is to be maintained pendingcompletion of our substantive review.   In carrying out this further task, onwhich we have already embarked, we intend to examine the principles which should govern the pay of those covered by our terms of reference, and to look afresh atthe pattern of relativities.BOYLE OF HANDSW0RTHHI ATCHERLEYBEECHINGGEORGE COLDSTREAMANTHONY LLOYDSEEARMARK TURNERGERARD YOUNGOFFICE OF MANPOWER ECONOMICS17 March, 1972

I,    The Office of Manpower Economics on behalf of the Top Salaries Review Body carriedout a survey of movements in salaries of top management in private and nationalised industries from September 1968 (the date of the NBPI survey of top salaries1) to september 1971*     The survey was designed to provide more information about salaries atihe highest levels than was available from existing sources.     The Confederation ofBritish Industry was consulted about the form of the survey.     The questionnaire was addressed to one-third (337) of &quot;The Times 1000&quot; list of the largest commercial andindustrial companies, to 33 of the larger financial companies and to the 14 mainnationalised industries and 24 Area Gas and Electricity Boards.    It was sent out at theend of December 1971.i,    This was a wider sample and included smaller companies than the NBPI survey, whichiras confined to a sample of the 300 largest commercial and industrial companies and somefinance companies, of which 101 responded, and the results are not directly comparable(the NBPI survey was in any case more detailed).     The analysis is based on 215 returnsi . ,from private industry and 38 returns from nationalised industries (a further 7 returnsfrom private industry showed only a single year&apos;s data).     The total response of 260-returns out of 408 issued was 64 per cent (60 per cent from private industry only).    Afurther 10 per cent (42) of the total were outside the scope of the survey because ofnajor reorganisations and this probably applied to other non-respondents.5.    The sampling fractions of companies, sample numbers and response both of firms andposts covered in the analysis given in Tables 1 to 3 are shown below:-	Sampling fraction	Sample number	Usable response	Chair-men	Deputy Chair-men	Main Board(a) Members	Senior Execu-tives	Total^Commercial and industrial:								1 Assets over  m250	All	23	19	17	17	125	187	346 mlOO - 249	All	52	35	28	27	206	261	522 mlO   -   99	2/5	154	88	51	23	393	537	1^004Under  mlO	1/5	108	5,3  ,	31	17	166	233	447Total	1/3	337	195	127	84	890	1,218	2,319financial		33	20	&apos;    8	12	81	134	235Total private		370	215	135	96	971	1,352	2,554Pationalised industries								1 (incl.

Scope of the survey4,   The posts covered in private industry are only those for which the nature orresponsibility had not changed materially at least in the latest year to September1971 or where the basis of remuneration had not changed, eg a substantial shift in thebalance between salary and pension contribution.   Figures for earlier years were onlyto be supplied if similarly comparable.   The senior executives covered were thosereporting directly to Main Board members but not more than jO posts in total werecovered by any company.   The questions asked (in the questionnaire to private industry)were a position code and for September in each of the last four years: (l) theamount of salary and directors1 fee and (2) the bonus, commission or profit sharingreceived in the last full year; and for the latest year&apos;s salary, the operative date of the last increase.   For the nationalised industries similar information was obtained about salaries and additional questions were asked in respect of the chairmen and Board Members about length of service, internal or externalrecruitment and reasons for retirements and resignations; this additional information is required mainly for the Review Body&apos;s forthcoming substantive review.Salary levels and changes5.   Table   1   compares the average salaries and their spread (mediansquartiles and highest and lowest deciles ) of Chairmen, Deputy Chairmen, board members and senior executives reporting direct to main Board members in nationalisedand private industry by size of undertaking.   The two largest size groups in terms ofcapital employed correspond very broadly to the private sector company Groups A and Bin NBPI Report Wo 107* on Top Salaries,but the third group includes more small com-panies than Group C in the NBPI Report,and the smallest group was not represented inthat survey.   In addition,the ranges of the larger size groups are the same as in the nbpi survey and have not been revised upwards to allow for inflation and growth of assets.   The movements in salary levels within each of the ranges between the twosurveys therefore do not fully reflect the rise in salaries between September 1968 and september 1971*   Averages and spread of earnings of senior executives in the companies with capital employed of  250m. and over are not shown because a number of the largestcompanies provided figures for Chairmen, Deputy Chairmen and Board Members but not for senior executives.As a result,the figures available are incomplete and inconsistent with those of Board Members and above.   It will be seen that the differences in average pay between size groups in private industry are accentuated the higher thepost, the Chairmen having almost a 4 : 1 ratio between the largest and smallestgroup of companies compared with a little over 2 : 1 for Board members and the differences for the groups shown for senior executives are also narrower than forie the salaries of the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th percentage places in rankingorder by size- 18 -
CONFIDENTIALjrd members.   It is also noticeable that, while the present ,iay of Chairmen andSard members in Croup A and B nationalised industries corresponds most nearly to theIrage of the third size group ( mlO - 99) in private industry,that of senior executivesn Groups A and B nationalised industries is considerably higher than in this group and notat behind that in the  100m -  250m group in the private industry.   Because the payifisenior executives     in the nationalised industries is closer to private industry than is the pay of Board members, the spread of earnings shows   ajignificant overlap in pay levels between senior executives and main Board members in thelationalised industries, and the highest deciles for senior executives in each of groups A,lW C   are higher than the lower quartile for main Board members, despite the relatively few industries concerned.   The spread of earnings within each group showsf however ^that the size of assets is only a crude guide to differences in responsibility as reflected in pay.jfis would apply still more to comparisons between private and nationalised industry thana comparison within the field of private   commercial and industrial companies.)j  Table 2 gives the results of the changes in salaries of all posts covered in commercial,pdustrial and finance companies over respectively the three years and two years to Septem-Sr 1971.   Over both the three-year period from September 1968 to September 1971 and the twoyear period from September 1969 to September 1971 there is clear evidence of a smaller move-Bent in the highest salaries than in those below with dividing lines at salary levels (inSeptember 1970) of  8,000,  14,000 and  30,000.   Over these two periods the weighted averagerespective increases up to  8,000 were 34*7 and 23.7 per cent; from  8,000 to  14,000 30.2lid 20.5 per cent; from  14,000 to  30,000 24.7 and 16.6 per cent and over  30,000 14.7 and1.7 per cent.   Salaries generally (based on the Department of Employment&apos;s survey&quot;&apos;&apos;) rose by29 per cent from July 1969 to December 1971 and prices by 20 per cent to January 1972.1*   Table 3 shows the annual movements and linked total percentage changes over the period for Chairmen, Deputy Chairmen, main Board members and senior executives in private industry,iere again the effect of smaller increases for higher salaries is apparent and is reflectedEn substantial narrowing in the differentials between these groups.   Against this there is some evidence from consultants surveys that other remuneration, such as pension provision and the cost of providing company cars, has been increasing faster for higher salaries,partly offsetting the narrowing of the salary differential (this reservation also applieslo Table 2). -Bate of last increase /3.   Table 4 shows the date of the last salaries&apos; increase (September 1971) for Chairmen,Deputy Chairmen, main Board members and senior executive in private industry.   It will beseen that about half of the salaries of Chairmen and a little more than half for deputy chairmen were increased in the current year, about one-quarter in the previous year and theremainder either in the year before or earlier.   For main Board members about three-quarters  were increased in the current year, a little under one-fifth in the previous yearand the remaining 9 per cent earlier, whereas for senior executives 90 per cent were increased in the current year and most of the remainder in the previous year.   The tableSalary Survey linked to Monthly Index of Wage and Salary EarningsCONFIDENTIAL
shows that annual adjustments are normal though not universal for the senior executivesand that for the higher posts annual adjustments are less frequent.9.  From the information supplied it appears that the commonest months in which increasesoccur are January (20 per cent of Board members and 23 per cent of senior executives),July (17 and 22 per cent respectively) and April (15 per cent in each case).   These threemonths together account for just over half the increases of Board members and 60 percent of the increases for senior executives.- 20 -CONFIDENTIAL
