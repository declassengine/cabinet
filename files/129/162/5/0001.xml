THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;5 government cp(72) 30 COPY NO       6 Z3 March 1972CABINETEFFECT OF A POSSIBLE RAIL STRIKE ON electricity and OTHER CONSEQUENCESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. This paper is circulated in accordance with our decision to give further consideration to the possibilities of a rail strike.    It assumesstrikes beginning alternatively on 8, 20 and 31 March and 15 April (seeTables I and II);  and also the possibility of sporadic action from20 March (see paragraphs 4 and 5);  for simplicity the Tables make only two assumptions about fuel supplies after a strike commences:-Case I  - no further supplies of coal at all and no oil by road orrail (these oil supplies are relatively small) but seaborne and pipeline supplies to continue;  gas to continue.Case II - no railborne supplies of coal or oil but road, seaborneand pipeline supplies at normal levels;  ga.- to continue.It may prove possible to organise the transfer of some of the normal rail traffic to the roads.    The physical limitations on this are being studied by the National Coal Board and the Central Electricity Generating Boardbut I am discounting this possibility as there is a high probability that thesupplies transferred would be &quot;blacked&quot;,2.        As to resisting the effect of the strike by reducing electricityconsumption, I have confined myself to the savings from a package of restrictions broadly equivalent to those in force in the week beginning14 February.    More rigorous restrictions can be contemplated but reports are coming in from the Area Boards that some of the vital services -notably water and sewage&quot; - would have been in difficulty by the end of a third week of restrictions at the recent level.    These warnings are being pursued;  meantime, we must be cautious about the ability to maintain more severe restrictions for any length of time,3. The Tables attached indicate the range of possibilities on theforegoing assumptions.    These are approximate estimates which are verysensitive to the assumptions.    My Department is continuing work upon them,
4, If there were go-slows and similar industrial action by the railwaymen, electricity supplies would be at some risk.    But given theprospect of some stock build of coal in the coming weeks, the ability to diminish coal consumption by over firing, even if not at the rates intended for this month, the hopes of being able for a time to step up road deliveries of oil, if not of coal and the fact that the load on the system should, after easter, be moving towards the summer trough, electricity supplies oughtto be generally well maintained unless the railwaymen1 s sporadic actionbegins to become very widespread and continuous and to be supported bysympathetic action by other unions,5, Paragraph 4 assumes go-slows etc but not full denial of coal trains.If these were denied to eg. large power stations in the Midlands, thesituation would be well on the way towards Case II.COAL SUPPLIES FOR OTHER USERS6. Industry would obviously start with low stocks of coal in the eventof a rail strike any time in March - about two weeks on average - but by mid-April, these stocks should have increased to around three weeks on average. In practice, industry could expect to get by for longer than thesetwo and three weeks because electricity cuts would diminish, perhaps byhalf, the normal rate of consumption and there would be the hope of somedeliveries by road. No special difficulty is foreseen with coke ovens or with the priority categories of domestic consumers.CONCLUSIONS7. The general conclusion from the foregoing analysis is that from20 March onwards, the country should be capable of managing for some weeks so far as electricity supplies are concerned, provided restrictionsat the level of 14 February were introduced at once.    The limitations on supplies would involve a good deal of disruption of industry, a loss of manufacturing output of the general order of 15-20 per cent of normal, a loss of about l\ million man-days of employment per week, and widespread and continuous upsets in commerce and private life.    If it were necessary,after these weeks of restrictions it would be possible to move to a lowersystem of supply which would assure the continuance of the vital servicesbut would involve the cessation of supplies of electricity to nearly allindustry and commerce and prolonged disconnections for domestic consumers.    The necessary arrangements are being completed.8,        In these circumstances, the questions we shall need to consider arewhether, if a rail strike begins, it is likely to be brought to an end onsatisfactory terms in a reasonably short space of time or whether oncestarted, it will only be settled at a high price, as with the miners, andafter considerable loss to the country.J d department of Trade and industry March 1972
