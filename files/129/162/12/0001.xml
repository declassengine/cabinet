jS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 37 COPY NO    g J)14 March 1972CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT PAYMENTS IN STRIKESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Social services. I circulate this paper as a basis for the consideration of the courses open to us should we decide that the Social Security Act 1971 did not go far enough in restricting the payment of supplementary benefit (SB) in strikes.My colleagues will wish to consider the issues raised.    But they will also need to know the views of the Secretary of State for Employment since, in preparing the paper, I have become convinced t&apos;u^,&apos;f important issues ofindustrial relations are at stake as well as the mechanics of SB,2. I suggest that we should first consider whether events since thepassage of the Social Security Act 1971 demonstrate beyond doubt that the1971 reforms were insufficient.    In the process of removing abuse theysubstantially reduced the amounts available to strikers who get tax refundsor strike pay, and (as from 3 April) will remove the SB bonus which strikersused to get on returning to work.    Some illustrative examples of the effectare given in Annexes 1 and 2, and further statistical information is in annex 3.3. Until the miners&apos; strike there had been few strikes attracting SB(&quot;SB strikes&quot;) since the Act was passed (it was not, of course, the Actwhich led to this dramatic decline in strike activity) and it is only theminers&apos; strike which has made some of our supporters say that the Act wasa failure and to ask for something more drastic.    (Annex 4 gives details ofall SB strikes since summer 1971).THE MINERS&apos; STRIKE40 Before they decided to strike the miners knew - very well indeed -the rules about SB including the rates of benefit.    This means that they knew that single men - probably about 30 per cent of all the strikers - haveno automatic right to SB, and that the total household incomes married men would get when SB is drawn would still be well below the level at which the lowest paid miners, except those with very large families, live while atwork.    They knew that probably by no means all the 280, 000 strikers would need to apply for SB, and that, even with SB4 there would be heavy debts(arrears of hire purchase^ rent, fuel bills, etc) to pay after the strike.Minimum pre-strike tsaflce home pay was round about  18- 20 perweek and this would be the minimum reduction in the household income of
those not claiming SB,    Those who drew SB ( 7,28 on average) would havehad a correspondingly smaller reduction in household income during thestrike and correspondingly lower debts.    As it turned out, the miners willdraw an average of  50 arrears of pay on 24 March, and a majority of them also had tax refunds (on 3 March) of the order of  35 each - much the sameas was paid in SB to those who claimed it but had no tax refunds,,    (Some ofthis  35 would however have to be used in the first few days after thestrike before wages were paid).5. It is for the Department of Employment to advise the degree towhich the availability of benefit for dependants is relevant to the inceptionand/or length of strikes.    We need to be sure that it is really relevantbefore making changes,POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION6. The courses considered in the run up to the 1971 Bill, and anothersince put forward, with brief summary statements of the arguments for and against them, are set out in Annex 5.    I do not think we need spend anytime discussing 3 which would simply increase public expenditure and help the strikers pay off debts from arrears of tax;  4 which would have no advantage over straight recovery through the employer;  5 since it wouldbe ineffective;  or 6.    I understand that there are powerful arguments, on grounds of industrial relations policy and of law against 8;  and in any case if it were introduced at once it would throw an intolerable burden on the supplementary Benefits Commission (SBC) staff except where the strikingunion has substantial strike funds.    The only candidates which are worthserious consideration are 1 (discontinuance of S3), 7 (deemed strike pay)and 2 (recoverable SB).DISCONTINUANCE OF SB7. In 1971, when we rejected the idea of discontinuing SB, we did so onthe basis that discontinuance would mean that while there would be noautomatic right to SB, payment for wives and children would still beavailable under the SBCs discretionary powers to prevent hardship(Section 13 of the 1966 Act).    We did not perhaps then see that the concept of entitlement as of right introduced in 1966 would lead, as it has done, toa significant change in strikers&apos; attitudes.    In the recent strike this led togreatly increased claims by single men on grounds of hardship.    Byanalogy if entitlement of right were removed, married men would makehardship claims in great numbers, which would have to be met so long asSection 13 remained.    If a union chose not to pay strike pay or to makehardship grants or chose to strike without having the money to do either,the SBC would be obliged as the law now stands to pay benefit in manycases to strikers&apos; dependants.8.        Alternative 7 (deemed strike pay) raisfts the same difficulty.    If itwere not in fact paid large numbers would claim under Section 13,    Tomake the &quot;deeming&quot; effective therefore would require the repeal of this -the &quot;hardship&quot; - clause,
9. My conclusion is that if we adopt either of these two ideas - deemedstrike pay or the discontinuance of SB - we must abandon the principle,which existed in Poor Lav/ days and was given statutoi/ form in the 1948Act, that the wives and children of strikers must in the last resort be protected from hardship,10 0        Such a change would involve dangers.    The Trades Union congress would be bound to oppose it fiercely.    We might find that we had divertedstrikers into guerilla action or demonstrations and even sabotage.    Itmight be repugnant, or made to be repugnant to many people, including some of our own supporters, by the search for and publishing of thepoignant, perhaps tragic, cases which would almost certainly arise.    Weshould be giving fresh ammunition for attacks by militants on the whole ofour programme, by mass demonstration, intimidation, and other ways whichthey could no doubt develop,11.        Moreover as the law stands - though this we can alter - people whohave no moral responsibility for a strike, and may gain nothing from it,have to be tieated as strikers.    Annex 6 explains this point in more detail,12.        The only way that I can suggest to make either of these changesconceivably practicable - with their correlative withdrawal of Section 13rights from strikers&apos; dependants - would be to to-2 the unions that the altered circumstances make it proper that hardship caused to the families of their members by strikes should be their responsibility^    They should ofcourse be given notice of the changed law.    We could then legislate now orsoon with an effective date in, say, January 1976,    In this way we should avoid the gross affront to the moderates in all parties (and in the unions)which would undoubtedly be caused by cutting off support for strikers5 wives and children without notice.    I would expect that the public generally would strongly agree that it was right to put an end, after due warnings, to a system under which strikes which blackmail the community are paid for by theirvictims;  and if that were so, the unions would be forced to take notice,13.        But we might succeed only in shifting the emphasis from strikes toother forms of blackmail such as listed above.RECOVERY OF SB14,        This would please those who agree that the State should help supportstrikers1 wives and children but see no reason why the strikers should notrepay the money when they earn wages again.    We rejected it in 1971mainly because of the operational difficulties.    These could probably be overcome, if necessary by providing extra staff.    The real objection isthat it would not be an effective deterrent.    A man who goes on strikeknows that he and his family will have to live very uncomfortably while itlasts, and will run more or less heavily into debt afterwards.    Manystrikers know that they will not need S3,    Single men are not certain thatthey will get any SB.    If tax refunds are available during the strike theywill help to avoid the need for SB; if they are not, they will help, ifavailable later, pay off the debts.   In view of this the knowledge that thosewho had to claim SB would have to repay it would hardly be decisive in thearguments about whether a strike is worth while.    And, unless the strikeended in total defeat, the strikers would see to it (as the miners did) thatthe settlement included a lump sum to set off against SB and other debts,,
15.       If recoverable S3 turned out to be no deterrent, we would be worse off than we are now;  there would still be SB strikes, and we should have set up a complex and controversial administrative machinery, needingextra staff, which was an additional cause of friction.    Moreoveremployers might well resent and dislike having to make deductions frompay long after the strike had ended.CONCLUSION160       I make no formal recommendation.    There is no certainty that SBis in fact relevant;  the effectiveness of no course can be guaranteed;  the risks of losing public opinion and of encouraging the militants are great.I do not believe that we would be right to take these risks only to quellcomplaints from large numbers who do not understand the implications.We should only make a change if we are convinced that the end result willbe better than now.K department of Health and Social Security13 March 1972

ANNEX 5POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION1.    DISCONTINUE SUPPLEMENTARY BENEFIT ALTOGETHERFOR THE FAMILIES OF STRIKERSThis might have a major effect as a deterrent to strikes since strikers wouldknow that in any long strike they would have to look to PAYE refunds and theirUnions for support.   Its justification would be the view that strikers couldnot abrogate responsibility for their families* maintenance simply because theychose to deny themselves earnings.   But where the strikers were determined, asin the miners1 strike, it would inflict great hardship on some wives andchildren and the odium for a measure which was harsher than anything done underthe Poor Law would fall on the Government.   On the other hand since 90$ of strikes last for less than 12 days, and only about 30$ - rising to 50$ in long strikes - of strikers claim supplementary benefit in strikes of over12 days the measure might cause great bitterness without materially effecting the number of strikes.   If the basic right to supplementary benefit were abolishedbut the Supplementary Benefit Commissions power (under s.13 of the 1966 Act)to make discretionary payments to prevent hardship to wives and children were retained, the inevitable result would be very heavy pressure for such payments, for virtually all strikers families.   It would be impossible to resist this pressure.   It follows therefore that the Commission^ discretionarypower would have to be abolished.2.     MAKE ALL SB TO STRIKERS REPAYABLEThis could be presented as a logical development of the post-strike recoveryprovisions of the Social Security Act and it would please many people whoconsider that the existing position is weighted in the striker&quot; s favour.Hardship would be avoided but the State would no longer foot the bill.   Itwould thus increase pressure on Unions to pay strike pay and to the extent that Unions did not make this available the greater would be the deterrent effect on the individual striker.   There is a precedent for action of this kind.Under the Poor Law there were provision for recovery although they were not always used.   If the man refused to pay an action had to be taken in the Courts,which could decide the rate of recovery.   Some repayments from the 1926 strikeswere still outstanding in 1939.   The system of recovery through employers,introduced in the Social Security Act 1971 * could, be adapted as necessary.   the cbi suggested in early 1970 that supplementary benefit for strikers&apos; familiesshould be repayable, but in the event employers might find the operation of themachinery for recovery very burdensome and. a cause of continuing unrest.The proposal might, however, cause bitterness in the aftermath of a strikewhen family men were having to repay large sums of money.   And since only a
small percentage of all strikers actually claim supplementary benefit, andno one would be worse off than at present while the strike was on, the deterrentvalue of the proposal may not be so great as is sometimes thought.     Wheresubstantial amounts of benefit were involved the men might well demand a &quot;bonus&quot;payment before return to work to enable them to meet their debt.     It is also possible that to the extent the proposal did have an effect on long strikes itmight lead to a more damaging pattern of short-term guerilla strikes, or workto rule.     The administrative difficulties for the SBC of recovering sums of upto  50 or more after a long strike would be considerable.3.     WITHHOLDING- INCOME TAX REFUNDS DURING A STRIKE.This would reduce the money available to a striker during the strike and would .put more pressure on his Union to pay strike pay.     There are, however, arguments of principle against withholding what is the striker&apos;s own money.     Moreover,it would have the direct effect of increasing the demand for supplementary benefitwhile leaving intact the refunds for the striker to draw after the strike.It could therefore only be operated if entitlement to supplementary benefit were also to be abolished.     IT supplementary benefit were merely to be recoverableit might be argued that it did not matter how much was paid out during the 1strike.     Against this however, it could equally be said that the more money astriker has during the strike the easier it is for him to stay out;   that the recovery of this additional debt would increase post-strike bitterness;   andthat it would seem odd to say the least that the income tax refunds shouldsubsequently become available to help pay off the debt created during thestrike.4.     TAXATION OF SUPPLEMENTARY.BENEFIT (OR RECOVERY OF SB THROUGHPAYE SYSTEM).The amount of benefit paid during a strike would not be affected.     But the sums paid would be notified to the employer and some of them would subsequently be recovered by adjustment of the PAYE coding.     This might be held to involveless bitterness and, since it might need to be spread over a full year, lesshardship than recovery of a loan.     And the operation of the tax system mightbe held to safeguard the low-earner.     The whole of the supplementary benefitpaid to a striker could similarly be recovered through the PAYE system, using a&quot;grossing up&quot; procedure as an alternative to recovery as a loan direct fromthe employer.     The objections to these courses are that they would involve6
great demands on the staff of the SBC and Inland Revenue, particularly wherea strike involved large numbers of persons in a single area.     Except tothe extent that all short-term benefits were taxedthey would be patently discriminatory;   and they could be held to be a misuse in principle of the tax system.5.     HARSHER RULES FOR STRIKERS&apos; CAPITAL RESOURCES.Theoretically it would be possible to devise stricter capital rules forstrikers - at present amounts of less than  325 are completely ignored and greater amounts are deemed to yield weekly sums of 5p for each  25 between 325 and  800 and 12^p for each complete  25 above  800.     In a strike situation,however, it would be difficult to administer tight rules on capital and evasionis likely.     It would penalise only the more thrifty and would be unlikely tohave a significant deterrent effect since only a minority of strikers have -or at least declare - capital.6.     EXTENDING THE &quot;WAITING&quot; PERIOD FOR SB PAYMENTS.SB payments are not normally made during the first two weeks of a strike.Under this proposal SB payments during a strike would be paid as now after two weeks for workers whose average earnings were less than the average earningsfor all workers, say,  30 a week, but would not be paid to workers with earnings above this level for the first four or perhaps five weeks.     This scheme would have more impact on the finance of strikes than repayable supplementary benefit would but it would make no difference to men with earnings below theaverage.     The dividing line of, say,  30 would be bound to appear arbitrary;evidence of previous earnings might be difficult to obtain;   and there wouldhave to be provision to living up to the limit of their incomes who could notmanage on their own resources for four or five weeks.While the scheme might be acceptable to moderate opinion in that it would seemreasonable to apply sterner rules to those with higher earnings the need to find out which side of the  30 level a man fell and the need to make hardshippayments to those above this level would complicate administration for the SBC;and it would be seen by some as an abuse of the supplementary benefits scheme.7
7.     DEDUCT AN ALLOWANCE FOR UNION STRIKE PAY FROM SB ENTITLEMENTS FORSTRIKERS&apos; FAMILIES.Another possibility would be automatically to offset a specified sum in calculating the SB entitlements of a striker&apos;s family by an amount his tradeunion might reasonably be expected to provide as strike pay, eg  5 a week.This proposal would get round the difficulty of requiring Unions by law to payspecified amounts to their members but would still keep the pressure on themto do so.     Difficulties would, however, arise if Unions did not in fact pay the. 5 especially in long strikes.     Families of strikers would then be kept in very straitened circumstances, and the hardship provisions of the MOSS Act would come into play.8.     COMPULSORY STRIKE PAYMENTS FROM UNIONS.Under this proposal Unions would be required to pay a reasonable level of strike pay to their members on strike.     The SBC would then disregard  1 of it under its present rules.     This could be an alternative or complement to makingSB payments repayable.     The main advantage of this proposal is that it ensuresthat Unions calling official strikes take reasonable financial responsibilityfor their action.     This cannot be guaranteed under the proposals to make SBrepayable;   indeed, as Unions have already recognised the reduction in the1971 Act of the disregard from  3.35 to  1 reduces the pressure on them topay more than  1 a week strike pay to strikers receiving SB.     Any larger amount would be taken off the SB payment.On the other hand it could be seen as a direct attack on trade unions.     Itwould hit particularly hard the weaker unions with small financial resourceswho might either be in effect prevented from taking official strike actionaltogether or be driven into bankruptcy.     It would also seem a departure fromnormal practice for the Government to require a voluntary organisation toprovide a specified degree of financial assistance to its members in certaincircumstances.     Finally, unless the arrangements were extended to unofficial&apos;strikes also, the proposal would do nothing to discourage unofficial action and might even encourage it.     Some of these objections might, however, bemet by providing that these arrangements would come into operation, say,three years after the passing of the legislation.     This would give Unionstime to build up a hardship fund from which they could finance strikes.
DEFINITION OF A STRIKER1.      Restrictions on supplementary benefit and unemployment benefit for persons without work because of a trade dispute are contained in the relevant Acts  (National Insurance Act 19^5 Section 22(l),  Ministry of social Security Act 1966 as amended by the Social Security Act 1971)-These restrictions apply to a person unemployed because of a stcrppageof work due to a trade dispute at his place of employment who is:-a. participating in the trade dispute,  orb. directly interested in the trade dispute,  orc. financing the trade dispute,   ord. a member of a grade or class which is doing one of a.   to c.The effect is that not only strikers themselves but other work peoplelaid off as a result of the strike can be caught by the restrictions.No distinction is made between strikes and lock-outs.2.      The Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employers&apos;  Associations(the Donovan Commission)  in their report in 1968 recommended complete abolition of the &quot;grade or class&quot;  disqualification (d.  in 1 .  above)  andthat a person should not be regarded as financing a dispute merely because he was a member of a trade union paying strike pay to those on strike.    The Commission also recommended that consideration should begiven to amending the term &quot;direct interest&quot;  in 1.b.  above to excludeany minor interest.    The Labour Government1s NSSI Bill proposed theabolition of both the grade or class and the financing provision,  thelatter in toto because the more restrictive Donovan recommendationwould have been impracticable.    Cabinet have agreed that similareasements should be made when the Secretaries of State for employment and the Social Services agree that  the time is suitablefor this.3.      During the passage of the Social Security Bill 1971  there waspressure for the Donovan recommendations /to be implemented before opera-ting the additional restrictions on strikers proposed by that Bill.  Alimited undertaking was given to consider this later in 1971 ,  in thelight of the  strike situation,  but no change has yet been consideredjustified.IMPLICATIONS OF MORE SEVERE RESTRICTIONSThe enactment of more telling restrictions on the supplementary benefit rights of strikers would obviously strengthen the protests that the annex 6
restrictions affect more than the strikers themselves.    those affected would include fellow workpeople laid off as a resultof the strike,  not strikers themselves and possibly evenopposing the strike.    Such &quot;innocent&quot; groups could be foundamong:a. those with an interest in its outcome which is slightbut held by the National Insurance Commissioner to be&quot;direct&quot;b. those in the same union as the strikers, where theunion is paying strike payc. those financing the strike in other ways,   eg eventhrough rafflesd. those in other unions, not on strike, but in the samegrade or class as strikerse. those locked out by an employer5.      If it were desired to exclude some or all of these categories from new restrictions,  this could largely be doneby legislating in the way the previous Government proposed,eliminating the &quot;financing&quot; and &quot;grade or class&quot;  provisions,but this would still leave some area open to criticism in the&quot;directly interested&quot;  category.    There would be much greater difficulty in distinguishing between a strike and a lock-out and in some cases it would probably be impossible to do so.    Tattempt to make a distinction between the two might well alsoinfluence the course of a trade dispute towards the point wherthe workers participating in it felt able to claim that theywere actually &quot;locked out&quot;.10
