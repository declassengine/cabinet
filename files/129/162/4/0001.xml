EFFECTS OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION BY RAILWAY UNIONSMemorandum by the Minister ibr Transport industries.        I way invited by my colleagues to assess the extent and effectiveness of industrial action by the railway unions, taking accountof possible support from other unions.THE FORM OF INDUSTRIAL ACTION2.        If the railway unions, or any one of them, do net accept thebest pay offer British Railways can make, industrial action will follow.    This could be sporadic and local, and, therefore, no morethan a nuisance;  or, much more serious, a concentration on keytraffics (for example, coal and oil to pc/er stations);  or an all-outstrike.    The I wo last possibilities would do serious and immediatedamage.3. The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and FiremanfASLEF) and thn National Union of P^ii-??railwaymen (NUR) could act eitheralone or together.    In either case the system could be effectivelystopped.    ASLEF could disrupt it through having 90 per cent of thefootplate men and nearly all the long distance and freight drivers.    TheNUR could achieve similar results through having all the signalmen.Although some key jobs are held by the Transport and Salaried StaffsAssociation (TSSA), which covers the office staff, the impact of action by them is less easy to define.WHAT THE RAILWAYS CARRY4. The table below gives the breakdown of the total rail traffic:Coal and coke 104m tonsIron ore and steel 33m tonsOil 19m tonsEarth and stones 14m tonsChemicals 4m tonsOthers 26m tonsFuels used by power stations are 66 per cent coal (72m tons)v 22 per cent oil10 per cent nuclear2 per cent hydroThese fuels are transported to the power stations as follows:-Coal       OilRail 72% 27%Road 15% 10%Pipeline or sea tanker - 63%Other 13%
Fuel carried by rail amouc^o to 53 per cent of the power stationsrequirement.ALTERNATIVES TO RAIL5. The only large scale alternative to rail is road transport.For freight generally, there are enough lorries.6.        For coal, there are also enough;  some   10, 000 tippers might be needed, out of a tipper fleet of 50, 000c    But the latest National coal board (NCB) estimate (not yet completed in detail) is that it would not be practicable to load more than about half of total coal output into roadvehicles (loading arrangements designed for rail do not readily convertto road).7.        Half of NCB&apos;s total output of 140 million tons is needed for power stations at normal rates.    The Central Electricity Generating Board(CEGB) can accept this amount by road.8. The oil companies estimate that the normal rail lift of oil to power stations could be carried by 160 road tankers;  they say these could be made available without serious reduction of any other important movement.ATTITUDE OF NON-RAILWAY UNIONS9.        The theoretical capacity of road transport to act as the alternativedepends however on what line other unions take.    The National Union of mineworkers (NUM) are almost certain to refuse to allow road vehiclesto load with pithead coal previously moved by rail.    The Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union (T&amp;GWU) might take the same line at refineries,refusing to load road tankers when these were in place of rail move-ment.    The Electrical Trades Union (etu) might &quot;black&quot; abnormaldeliveries to power stations.    The T&amp;GWU might also try to stop anyroad substitution through its lorry driver membership.    But road transport is not strongly unionised, and the tippers in particular havemany owner drivers.    The one strong hold which T&amp;GWU have is overroad tanker drivers, and they could thus, if so minded, paralyse allroad transport, cars as well as buses and lorries, very quickly.10.       The T&amp;GWU or&apos; etu reactions are uncertain.    Neither supported the miners directly.    The T&amp;GWU did obey picket lines; but they havenot supported the rail unions previously in comparable situations.    Butthe movement of coal or oil to power stations would be a direct attempt at strike-breaking, and the T&amp;GWU reaction could be expected to be the stronger accordingly.    The same question of direct strike-breakingwould concern the etu workers at power stations.    They seem to be ofa mood to keep &quot;their&quot; stations going, and not to have them interrupted.But this loyalty would be severely tested if fuel was being sent in instrike-breaking ways.
CONCLUSION11.       Neither the extent nor the effect of a rail strike can be precisely forecast.    Even if only the NUM support the railwaymen,fuel supply to power stations would be cut to 73 per cent, (with allother normal essential rail movements adequately covered by road);and coal supplies to other users would stop.    If the T&amp;GWU at therefineries or driving road tankers support the railwaymen the totalpower station fuel supply would be only 48 per cent because themovement by road of oil would be cut off.    In these conditions, thequestion of stock-building and the timing and rate of reduction ofelectricity supply would be crucial.    This aspect is being covered bythe Minister for Industry in his paper.12. Apart from the threat to power supplies, the only other majorthreat is to London commuting. It would not however stop essential work there..TP3
