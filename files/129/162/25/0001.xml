THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS government cp (72) 50 Copy No. 08315 May, 1972CABINETOBJECTIVES AND PRIORITIES FOR RESOURCEALLOCATION IN SOCIAL affairs memorandum by the Central Policy Review Staff (CPRS)For the purposes of this paper we have taken social affairs ascovering health and personal social services, social security,education, law and order, and housing. These programmes account for about half of all public expenditure. This group of programmes is not homogenous. They are, however, interdependent, primarilybecause they all have important social consequences.2. The attached paper is a first attempt to draw togetherinformation about resource allocation in the field of social affairs, to identify some of the issues with which Ministers are likely to be confronted, and to suggest ways in which a more systematic approach to these problems might be developed.3. Specific decisions can only be taken after Ministers have considered the report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee(PESO, and this paper does not seek to anticipate those decisions.It attempts to provide a background against which Ministers canconsider their objectives and priorities in social affairs in general terms.4. In the light of our analysis, we suggest that Ministers should discuss and, where possible, reach broad conclusions on thefollowing strategic questions (references are to paragraph numbers in the attached paper):Decisions which could affect people during this Parliament(1) In what directions do Ministers think it most important tomake any changes to affect peopled welfare during the next twoyears? Within the constraints of the public expenditure programmesuch changes can be only marginal and primarily in the fast-actingforms of public expenditure, e.g. cash benefits, or, subject to the constraints of the tax reform programme, in taxes.
Issues on which decisions could be announced during this parliament or thereafter(2) Do Ministers agree with the description of future pressuresin paragraphs 12, 13 and 14; and in particular with the distinctionbetween (a) improvements to general services, (b) provision for individuals and groups with special needs, and (c) levelling upinequalities in services? Given the constraint on total resources,should more priority in general be given to the latter two?(3) Do Ministers agree that the following list contains the mostimportant resource issues (most of them now receiving active study),on which they will be asked to take decisions in the next two years?Do they wish to add to the list? How far do they feel able to assignpriorities to these issues, in particular in terms of announcing new policy initiatives before the end of this Parliament?Provision for the elderly, severely disabled, and mentally illand handicappedAspects of children at risk in the social systemFamily planning servicesAbortionThe general level of cash benefitsTax credit schemeHigher education and schools expenditureStructure of the teaching profession, e.g. teacher training and pay structureUrban programmeRace relationsHomelessnessInner city areas and slum clearance.Future resources for social programmes(4) On present estimates, expenditure on health and social services, education and law and order will rise faster than public expenditure as a whole. Will these above average rates of increasebe sustainable for very long if provision is to be made for realimprovements in social security? If not, will the general balance of programmes need to be modified, including the balance betweensocial affairs and other programmes?
(5) Are any of the ideas in paragraph 25 worth pursuing inorder to get more room to manoeuvre in the longer term, e.g.:(a) charging for services, especially new services, where the recipient can pay, e.g. nursery education; higher education,possibly with student loans; optional medical treatment;(b) more assumption of responsibility by the private sector,possibly encouraged by grant or tax relief, e.g. care for thevery old; social security insurance; private sector housing;(c) more efficient use of resources by the public sector,e.g. preventive measures such as water fiuoridation orfamily planning; improvements in educational technology;tighter cost-effectiveness controls on methods of health service treatment?Control of priorities(6) The powers of local and executive authorities (buttressed bythe rate support grant, the minimum of specific grants and professional autonomy) impose powerful constraints on Ministers&apos;ability to determine priorities, paragraph 26. Can the balance bere-adjusted, in ways consistent with Ministers&apos; general philosophyof devolution, e.g. by circulars or joint planning? Or are more radical measures needed?A new approach(7) Do Ministers agree there is need for further co-ordination in the approach to these problem areas, paragraph 15?(8) Do Ministers agree that the approach in this paper shouldbe further developed with a view to measuring resources againstlong-term objectives, as a basis for policy planning exercises whichlook further ahead than PESC, which exploit the PAR system tothe maximum and which examine ranges of options other than theextrapolation of current policies, paragraph 28?Cabinet Office,15 May, 1972.

Resource Allocation: Social AffairsBY THE CENTRAL POLICY REVIEW STAFFThis paper is in three parts:PART I.   THE PRESENT POSITIONThis summarises the scale and pattern of resource allocation to social programmes and describes what the Government has done so far;PART II.   IMMEDIATE AND LONGER TERM PRIORITIESThis attempts to identify some of the policy issues withexpenditure implications which are relevant for the formulation of a future strategy for social affairs;PART III.   FUTURE RESOURCES AND ORGANISATIONThis examines the resource constraints on the development of future strategy and suggests ways in which a more coherentpattern of priorities might be determined.
I.  THE PRESENT position The resources devoted to the main social programmes in 1970, whenthe Government took office, are set out in Table 1. Two comments on this table are:(a) The statistics are being improved, though they will never be complete because it is impracticable to identify whathouseholds spend on non-institutional social care.(b) Public expenditure is not the only way in which theGovernment can influence the scale and distribution of social services. It can provide services free or for a charge;it can influence the price, through tax concessions orsubsidies, of what the private sector provides; or it can give people money, through grants or tax allowances, to buy what either the public or private sector provides. Theright-hand side of Table 1 therefore shows examples of the instruments currently available to the Government to influence the allocation of resources in relation to individualsocial programmes.

The Governments Policy and how it has been ImplementedWhen the Government took office it was committed to:(a) improving the social services;(b) filling the gaps in existing services;(c) restraining the growth of public expenditure as a whole.Social programmes were absorbing an increasing share of national resources, so that these objectives could only be reconciled by greater efficiency and by shifts in priorities in resource allocation. The mainsteps which the Government has taken to achieve its originalobjectives are:(i) Improvement of existing general servicesExtra provision for raising school leavingageReplacement of obsolete primary schoolsImproved staffing standards in schoolsImprovements of hospital buildingsIncreased provision of health centresImproved prisons, probation and after-care servicesIncreased pension and social security benefits and provision for uprating(ii) Selective provision for neglected groupsImproved services for the elderly, the mentally ill, the mentally handicappedand the disabledInvalidity benefit and improved facilitiesfor the chronic sickImproved invalid vehicle serviceAttendance allowancesFamily Income SupplementPensions for the over-80sPensions for widows between the ages of 40 and 50Offset by(i) Making the less needy pay more for public sector servicesFair rents, with rebatesSchool meals, with improvedremissionPrescriptions, ophthalmic and dental charges, with improvedconcessionsSelective charges for further education(ii) Economies in providing servicesRestraint of expenditure on highereducationWithdrawal of school milk fromjunior pupils(iii) Meeting needs more cost-effectivelyHouse improvements rather thanbuilding new houses(iv) More need met by the private sectorHome ownership helpedPrivate pension schemesencouraged
Measurement of the Governments Allocation of Resources(i) The PESC figures3 Table 2 shows the average annual change in proposed expenditureon the social programmes and other programmes under this government compared with the preceding period. During the period1964-65 to 1970-71, public expenditure in total was rising faster than the GNP, and social affairs expenditure faster than the total ofpublic expenditure. This created considerable strains on the economy and was in conflict with the present Governments tax objectives.The overall programmes for the period 1971-72 to 1975-76 are nowrising at a slower rate, with social affairs expenditure rising slightlyfaster than the total. While for many programmes the percentagerates of increase are lower than in the previous period, the absoluteamount of extra resources being made available each year is larger.The slower rate of growth in expenditure on social affairs, and tosome extent in public expenditure generally, will have been affectedby Ministerial decisions on social security upratings subsequent tothe publication of &quot; Public Expenditure to 1975-76 &quot; (Cmnd. 4829)on which this table is based (see footnote to Table 2). But the figuresdo show major changes in direction:(a) Within the social programmes, rapid increases in provisionfor schools, mainly on account of the raising of the school-leaving age; hospitals; local authority health and personal social services; housing improvement grants; and law andorder.(b) A much slower growth, compared with the previous period,in the provision for teacher training; housing subsidies,rebates and allowances.(c) New investment in housing remaining static; and a decline inthe provision for school meals and milk.(d) Outside the social programmes, an absolute decline in theprovision for commerce and industry, but a reversal of thedecline in defence expenditure.But the rates of growth of expenditure are a crude and, sometimes,misleading method of measuring improvements in services. Otheryardsticks are needed.

This produced an average annual increase of  109 million (2-5%) over theyears 1970-71 to 1975-76. Since then decisions have been taken on annual upratingsand on the amount of the 1972 uprating. These have increased the average annual rate of growth for social security to 3-5% per year.t ] Estimates containing an unknown quantity for SET.
(ii) Effects on households&apos; incomes4 These PESC aggregates do not show the effects of these shifts of priorities on individuals or families. It is difficult to measurechanges in real income over time for particular income groups and family types and still more difficult to identify how much is dueto Government measures. Table 3, however, gives a hypotheticalpicture of the way in which the command over income of households of different size and income levels might have changedbetween April 1970 and October 1972, as a result of generalmovements in prices and earnings and of specific changes in incometax and national insurance contributions &amp; benefits, introductionof family income supplement, rent &amp; rate rebates, school meals&amp; welfare milk, and housing costs.5 The picture is hypothetical because the calculations are based onaggregate indices of earnings and prices. They therefore imply thatall incomes have gone up at much the same rate (most unlikely tobe true) and that expenditure patterns do not differ much withlevels of disposable income or between household sizes (certainly not true). Moreover, the estimates do not cover the benefits foratypical households with special needs, e.g. those containingsomeone in need of attendance, and they may have been verydifferently affected.6 Subject to these very major qualifications, the table and the fullerdata which it summarises suggests that:(a) all the household types covered may be better off in real terms;ib) the percentage increase is highest for the lowest income levels;(c) the percentage increase tends to be higher for the smallerfamilies;(d) the poorest families with children, however^ will have gained substantially provided that they have taken up theirfamily income supplement (FIS); but in practice FIS take-up is at present only about half, although it is bigger thanthat among those with substantial entitlements.(iii) The poverty trap and tax credits7 Concentrating benefits on the poorest and tapering entitlement tothem sharply as income rises has caused what has come to be called the &quot; poverty trap &quot;. The position can be exaggerated but criticism

is growing and helping to cause frustration and disincentive forpoor families. Ministers are to receive a report on ways of dealingwith the worst anomalies; and will decide this session about the taxcredit system which will solve the problem of take-up, and removesome, though not all, of the anomalies. At this juncture, therefore, wewould simply remark that maintaining the value of present benefitsat the bottom end of the income scale and tapering entitlement tothem more gradually is bound to be expensive. Much of this expensewill benefit those higher up the income scale.
II.  IMMEDIATE AND LONGER TERM PRIORITIES8 So far, this paper has been concerned with the way policy has developed over the past two years. We now look to the future and try to identify the main policy issues which are relevant for the formulation of future strategy. In so doing we direct attention to:(a) the scope for action which can have observable effects withinthe lifetime of the present Parliament;(b) those longer-term issues of resource allocation in social affairs which, while they cannot yield major results duringthe present Parliament, could form the basis for a new approach to policy formulation now, and provide a starting point for new policy initiatives which can be implementedsubsequently.
Decisions which could Affect People during this Parliament9 The last full year of this Parliament is 1974-75. The broad lines of allocation of expenditure during this Parliament are determined bythe plans in &quot; Public Expenditure to 1975-76 &quot; and by the time whichit takes for public expenditure to have an effect. Disregarding thegeneral effect of management of the economy on people&apos;s prosperity,changes which will affect people&apos;s welfare in the lifetime of this parliament on any general scale must be mainly in cash benefits and(subject to the constraints imposed by the tax reform programme)in tax.10 As some guide we have had projected forward to October 1974 theDepartment of Health and Social Security estimates for the commandover income of the households shown in Table 3, allowing for the wage and price movements and Government measures already inthe pipeline, e.g. annual uprating of pensions, FIS and other means-tested benefits in line with prices and the further instalment of rent increases. The results, which are shown in Table 4, are subject to the same qualifications as those in Table 3 and furthermore,being for a future period, are based entirely on forecast overallmovements in prices and incomes (as used in the economic forecasts).There is the further important qualification that new government measures, like the postulated changes in the tax threshold, could and indeed might well be designed to bring about differences inthe assumed rate of increases in incomes and prices. Subject to thesequalifications, the prospects for the households shown in Table 3may be:(a) Given the Governmenfs commitment to annual upratingspensioners should be better off in real terms at the end ofthis Parliament than when the Government came into office,but they would enjoy no significant improvement afterOctober 1972.(b) Unless the tax threshold is raised in line with&apos; prices, someof the households at the lower end of the scale might losepart of the gains made by October 1972 as their higher gross earnings caused them to cross the tax threshold.(c) If the tax threshold is raised, those in work are likely tomaintain and improve the gains made between April 1970and October 1972 (though not by so much), assuming thatthe general pattern of wages rising faster than prices is true of their wages and prices.

(d) Any subsequent gain for the larger families at the lower endof the scale is likely to be smaller because it will be offset by the falling real value of family allowances and by thetapering of entitlement to means-tested benefits as realincome rises. Their prospects will be worse to the extent that they do not take up FIS.
Issues on which Decisions could be Announced during this parliament or Thereafter11 In considering future strategies it is useful to make a distinctionbetween the &quot; general&quot; services and benefits which are available forall people who would benefit from them, e.g. basic health, education and police services and social security benefits on the one hand, and,on the other, the provision of services and benefits for particular&quot; client groups &quot; who have special needs, e.g. the elderly, the mentallyand physically handicapped. A fundamental political decision onresource allocation is how to allocate the limited resources that theGovernment is prepared to make available between increasing the standards of &quot; general &quot; services or increasing the special services to&quot; client groups &quot;. And there are also problems of levelling up both&quot; general&quot; provision and provision for &quot; client groups &quot; between different parts of the country.12  &quot; General services &quot;Examples are:Hospitals: improved medical and surgical services.General practitioner services: improvements such as health centres.Law and order: probation and after-care services.Education: improvements in compulsory education, e.g. byprovision of more and better teachers and better building whereneeded.Tax credit scheme: this will provide a generalised system of income support which will pre-empt a large amount of resources and may reduce the room for manoeuvre in the period before its introduction.13   &quot; Client groups &quot;Some client groups have been identified and their problems are being studied, e.g.:(a) Extra resources for the disabled and the mentally handi-capped have been provided. The White Paper &quot; BetterServices for ^the Mentally Handicapped &quot; points out thatthere is pressure for a substantial number of new places,particularly in training or occupational schemes, inresidential care in the community, in hospitals for daypatients and for day care or education for under-5s,involving a switch towards care in the community ratherthan in hospitals.
(b) The PAR on the elderly has revealed how little we know-about the problems of the elderly. There are over\\ million elderly people living alone, and about 200,000 ofthese are so handicapped as to need substantial help to get through ordinary everyday life. The PAR should help toshow how available resources can be deployed more effectively to meet the needs of old people.(c) Work is also in hand on one-parent families, provision forthe disabled, the treatment of offenders and immigrantsand race relations. There are other important aspects ofclient groups, e.g. children at risk, education for the16-19 year olds, which have not yet been considered andwhich may require action. Such studies will reveal thedemand for new resources as well as a switch in existing provision.(d) We need far more information about the characteristics and problems of the individuals and families concerned. In the short term, efforts are being made to discover the characteristics of those claiming social security benefits.Ultimately, we need co-ordinated information about theparticular circumstances of individuals and families.Problems of Inequalities in Services between Different Partsof the Country14 The needs for both improved &quot;general&quot; and &quot;client group&quot;services come together in those parts of the country where provisionof services is at a lower level than elsewhere. These can be dividedinto two categories:(a) Regional inequalities: There are large disparities betweenthe level of provision in different parts of the country,about which we have insufficient information.(b) Poverty pockets: These are the areas which exist in all our major cities where housing, education, health and welfarestandards are low, and where law and order problems areacute. Housing is of v fundamental importance in povertypockets; and unless it is improved, the effectiveness of increased expenditure on other social programmes will be undermined. The Urban Programme makes a contributionto this overall problem. The approach announced by theSecretary of State for the Environment, by designating sixtown and inner city areas where a Group from the
CONFIDENTIAL15Department and the local authorities, headed by a Minister,would examine the total resources needed to transform theareas, represents a hopeful and radical approach. But thistoo will demand extra resources.If more is to be spent to reduce regional inequalities while totalresources are limited, then less will be available for those parts ofthe country which at present have the highest standards.These examples of future pressure emphasise that people&apos;s problemsdo not only relate to single Departmental programmes: their solutiondemands co-ordination between the various expenditure and taxationprogrammes applied to individual circumstances. This requiresDepartments, in considering their policies, to take account not only of their own specific responsibilities but of broader social aims.Institutional changes are also required, e.g. the Seebohm reformsand the reorganisation of the National Health Service, to bring aboutbetter co-ordination nearer the ground. This co-ordination needs toembrace Central Government, local authorities, executive authoritiesand voluntary organisations in programmes tailored to meetindividual needs. Even under local authority reorganisation, problemsof co-ordination will remain.
III.   FUTURE RESOURCES AND ORGANISATION16 We have identified three sorts of demand for increased expenditure: improvements in general services, more provision for particular client groups, and the reduction or removal of regionaldisparities. The rest of this paper examines some of the constraints,both economic and institutional, on finding the resources to meet these demands.17 In total, the social affairs programmes are now going ahead ratherfaster than public expenditure generally. If the burden of taxationis not to rise,* money to meet the future needs set out above willeither have to be met by a faster rate of national economic growthor by allowing the social services programmes to increase faster atthe expense of other programmes, e.g. defence, or by achieving themwithin the present rate of increase of the social services programmesby a more efficient use of existing resources and changes inpriorities.18 A major constraint on the development of new policies is the pressure to expand existing services to provide for a rising population and particularly the dependent groups, e.g. those up to the ageof 15 or in further education, or over 65, who are dependent uponthe working population. These dependent groups are expectedto grow both in absolute terms and in proportion to the working population, as Figures 1 and 2 illustrate. The major increase inthis proportion over the period shown is accounted for by the raising of the school leaving age. This apart, the steepest increase inthe dependency ratio is now past.19 In assessing priorities and claims on resources it is necessary to distinguish between those expenditures which result from thesedemographic changes and those which represent imprpvements in services.* The general public expenditure position is described in paragraph 17(d)of the Review of Government Strategy, CP (72) 49.

20 Table 5, which is derived from the Department of Education and science Programme Budget, gives some impression of the distributionof the main education PESC categories between these two groups.This budget is an important new instrument for planning.21 The figures are derived from the 1971 PESC report and therefore donot show the subsequent shift from universities to primary school building, of the order of  40- 50 million per annum during theperiod covered. The table shows that demographic factors, including in this case changes in the levels of participation and take up, account for 97-5 per cent of the expenditure shown in 1970-71 and 90 percent in 1975-76.22  The major individual trends which can be isolated are:(a) The growth in the schools sector derives mainly from changesin the size of the relevant age group, coupled with the raising of the school leaving age.(b) In the further and higher education sectors participationrates become the more important demographic factor.(c) Within the improvement  element  the table  shows  asubstantial increase in staffing ratios for both primary and secondary schools.

23 In health and welfare, where there is no general objective measureof the &quot; existing standard of service&quot;, it is more difficult to distinguish provision of existing standards for a growing population from improvements. Improvements in efficiency both provide a betterservice and allow for it to be provided to more patients. Moreover,advances in medical science can increase the cost of the service,sometimes at short notice. Nevertheless the Department of health and Social Security has made estimates which suggest that:(a) About three-quarters of the 3^ per cent annual growth of current expenditure on hospitals is spent on improvements,so that roughly 97% per cent of the total expenditure inany year is spent on maintaining existing standards for a growing population.(b) The hospital capital programme,  175 million in 1971-72,is aimed at improving the standard and distribution of hospitals rather than providing extra beds: neverthelessthese improvements enable the hospitals to cater for increasing numbers.(c) In local authority health and personal social services, themain problem is to improve the coverage and effectiveness of the provision, not demographic increases.24 For social security benefits 1971 PESC included an uprating in 1973which gave a modest real terms increase, and an uprating in 1975in line with the movement of earnings. This produced an average annual growth rate of 2-5 per cent over the years 1970-71 to1975-76. Since then it has been decided that upratings should beannual, not biennial, and the amount of the 1972 uprating has beendecided, bringing forward and increasing the real improvement due in 1973. This increases the average annual growth rate to 3-5 percent. If benefits were to be increased in line with earnings instead of only prices at the 1973 and 1974 upratings, the percentage wouldbe higher, leaving less room for manoeuvre for other programmes.Furthermore, trends in the incidence and length of sickness absences,and perhaps also in unemployment, may be expected to exert upwardpressures on the total of social security benefits, as has happened inthe past decade.25 Given the constraints imposed by the growth of existing programmes for demographic reasons, other methods of releasing resources for the most urgent improvements may have to be sought.Experience has shown that this is difficult, and it would be unrealistic to expect quick results.
CONFIDENTIAL21But:(a) Should there be more selectivity in providing services free from the public sector? Incomes policy considerations haveinhibited the Government from transferring more of theburden of financing public services on to those who can afford it in the private sector and there are always political difficulties in charging for existing services, hitherto free.Furthermore, charging can in certain circumstances be aclumsy and inequitable form of taxation. But it may bepossible in some areas, e.g. charging for higher educationpossibly by student loans instead of grants, and foroptional medical treatment. There are not the same difficulties in selective charging for services not hithertoprovided on a general scale, e.g. nursery education.(b) Could national and public expenditure resources be betterused if the public sector ceased to carry or assume responsibility for services which could be provided by the family or by individuals, helped as necessary by grant ortax relief, e.g. assistance to those maintaining over-75s athome, encouragement of social security insurance, andfurther encouragement of private housing?(c) Can services provided by the public sector use resources moreefficiently, e.g. preventive measures such as fiuoridation orfamily planning, and improvements in educationaltechnology?Central Government Control of priorities in considering the optimum allocation of the improvementselement, several factors limiting the central Governments ability toset priorities must be borne in mind:(a) The power of direction of central Government is limitedbecause on the ground the power to decide the distributionof services to people has been delegated to local authoritiesand executive bodies. Moreover there are wide variationsbetween the administrative machines and legal frameworksthrough which the different services have to operate. Thereis a real dilemma for the Government between planning and controlling priorities centrally on the one hand, and,on the other, devolving as much power as possible fromthe centre.
(b) A large part of the expenditure on the social services is controlled by local authorities, as the following figures for1971-72 show:  million 1971 survey prices	Central	Local	Government	authoritiesEducation       ....	451	2,444Health and personal social services	2,006	421Social Security ....	4,426	-Housing.....	269	888Law and Order	139	540There are major disparities between the need for, and present standards of, social service provision between different local authorities, and the current formulae fordistributing the rate support grant do not adequatelytake account of this. It seems desirable that new arrange-ments for the rate support grant should contain a revisedredistributive mechanism based on a better indicator ofoverall disparities in the level of social services than thepresent one.(c) A large amount of expenditure is effectively controlled bynon-elected executive authorities, e.g. through the clinicalfreedom and professional autonomy of doctors. This raisesthe question of whether there should not be some public,as opposed to clinical, accountability for methods oftreatment, by more comparision of &quot; pay-offs &quot; of different methods of treatment and by some monitoring of the drugsavailable for prescription.Future Policy Planning27  With the information at present available it is impossible:(a) to set a full enough range of objectives and options againstthe resources available to meet them;(b) to identify the problems of &quot; client groups &quot; in a way which provides the basis for the sensible development of policies.28 Ministers need this information if decision-taking is to be improved.This is relevant for PESC. But PESC simply projects the implications of current policy five years ahead and leaves room for manoeuvreonly at the margin. The development of the PAR system has a major part to play in improving the basis for decision taking. Butin addition to individual PAR studies there will also be a need forwider policy planning exercises on a longer time scale, in which more radical options can be considered.
