DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 32 COPY NO      &quot; b3 March 1972CABINETTHE LAW RELATING TO PICKETINGIN ENGLAND AND wales memorandum by the Attorney general .    CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS1. Lawful picketing is defined in Section 134 of the industrial relations Act, 1971, and, in effect, restates the previous law.Picketing is only lawful if the pickets, in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute, attend at or near a place where a person worksor carries on business, or at any other place where a person happens tobe (not being a place where he resides), and do so only for the purposeof peacefully obtaining information from him or peacefully communica-ting information to him or peacefully persuading him to work or not towork.2.        If the picketing goes beyond these peaceful purposes it iscriminal, either -a. because its purpose is to intimidate, to molest or to obstruct, which constitutes an offence under Section 7 ofthe Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875;   orb. because it constitutes threatening behaviour contraryto Section 5 of the Public Ojrder Act, 1936;c     because it constitutes an obstruction to the highway.3.        If pickets attend in greater numbers than are necessary for the peaceful purposes to which I have referred, they are almost certainlyunlawful.4.        If pickets were to attend at any given place in greater numb ersthan are necessary for peaceful purposes or if they make it clear Lhatit is their intention to attend in such numbers, the police could lawfullyrequire them to disperse.    Any who refuse to depart in such circumstances could be charged with obstructing the police.1
5. In my opinion, if the police are informed that pickets areexpected to attend at, or are being organised to travel to, a particularplace in such numbers that if they so assemble they would exceed thosenecessary for peaceful picketing, then the police could so advise the organisers and prevent the unlawful assembly.    But this remains amatter of judgment for the police.II.    CIVIL PROCEEDINGS6. Since the material parts of the law only came into force on28 February this year, most of them are as yet untested.    Moreoverimplementation of the law is complex and depends upon proof of facts which can obviously vary according to circumstances.    It is thereforeonly possible in this paper to recite general principles and providegeneral illustrations.7. The Industrial Relations Act removes proceedings in respectof acts done in contemplation or in furtherance of an industrial disputefrom the jurisdiction of the ordinary civil courts and provides alter-native remedies in the new National Industrial Relations Court (NIRC).Accordingly, where an act done in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute amounts to an &quot;unfair industrial practice&quot; the NIRC(at the suit of the person aggrieved) may issue an injunction to restrain,and order that compensation should be paid.8.        It is an unfair industrial practice for any person other than a registered union (the Society of Allied Locomotive Engineers and firemen (ASLEF), the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) and theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union (T&amp;GWU) are not at presentregistered) to induce or threaten to induce a breach of any contract in contemplation or furtherance of an industrial dispute.    However, theAct expressly provides that a contract of employment is not brokenwhere due notice of strike action - usually a week - is given.9. A union organiser or a picket who induces workers to break their contracts could be liable in civil proceedings for an injunction or compensation if he was not authorised by a registered union.    If theaction of the picket or the union organiser was authorised by anunregistered union then the union itself could be liable.    In the case of arail strike, an instruction by the T&amp;GWU to their drivers not to crossASELF picket lines could amount to an unfair industrial practice.   Butthe contracts of drivers (and of other employees (sometimes include aprovision that they should not be required to cross picket lines.    In suchcases, such instruction by T&amp;GWU would therefore not amount to an unfair industrial practice.2
10.        Sympathetic industrial action, e. g. &quot;blacking&quot; is not, of itself,an unfair industrial practice.    But it could be in certain circumstances.Broadly these arise where action is taken to organise or authorise astrike or irregular industrial action short of a strike:a. in order to further any action which is itself an unfairindustrial practice,    orb. for the purpose of either inducing a person who is not a party to the dispute (e. g. an oil supplier) to break or not to perform a subsisting contract (other than a contract ofemployment) with a person who is a party to the dispute(e. g. British Rail).11.       It is not an unfair industrial practice  or anyone (whether acting on behalf of a registered union or not) to induce a breach of a contract between two extraneous parties e. g. the National Coal Board and theCentral Electricity Generating Board.    However, an unregisteredunion (e. g. T&amp;GWU or someone acting on its behalf) might still be liable for inducing a breach of such a contract if it does so in the manner described in paragraphs 8 and 9 above.12.       There is the further possible alternative of civil proceedings before the ordinary courts, in respect of action which goes outside thescope of an industrial dispute or which constitutes some other kind ofcivil wrong.    The scope for such proceedings has effectively beenwidened since 28 February, for a union as such can now be restrainedor held liable in respect of such civil wrongs committed by peopleacting on its behalf.    This means that; -a. the civil courts could now grant a remedy against a union in respect of acts committed in furtherance of an industrial dispute where they amounted to a tort e. g. where picketsspread iron spikes on the road, or otherwise act, even by force of numbers, to obstruct the passage of lorries;b. the civil courts may possibly be disposed to restrict thescope of picketing or sympathy strikes themselves, by holding that they were not committed either in contemplationor in furtherance of an industrial dispute.13.       I must emphasise that this is difficult and uncharted territory.The courts would have to break new ground e. g. to decide that actionagainst power stations was not in furtherance of an original disputewithin the fuel (coal) industry.3
14.       Civil proceedings present a number of practical difficulties.a. It is difficult to obtain clear admissible evidenceestablishing responsibility on the part of senior union officials or their union.    Evidence implicating juniorofficials is easier to obtain, but might not always besufficient to involve the union itself in liability.b. Proceedings against senior officials (if they could not bejoined with successful proceedings against the union itself)could result in proceedings for contempt where injunctionsare disobeyed.c. If orders for compensation out of union funds are obtained it may be difficult to trace them should the unionsprove unco-operative.GENERAL15.       I cannot sufficiently emphasise that in all cases the ability tobring proceedings civil or criminal depends upon the supply ofaccurate information sufficient to constitute evidence in a court.    Forexample, information is now coming to hand, which if available duringthe recent coal strike, might have established some civil liability onthe part of senior union organisers.    It is therefore imperative thatthose wishing to bring proceedings and the Governments advisers,should at once be informed of the organising activities, orders and instructions of union officials and pickets which can be at variance withtheir public pronouncements.    But the police have no duty to informprospective civil litigants of matters on which could be founded civil proceedings.16.       In a railway strike situation it will be for others and not theGovernment to decide whether to bring civil proceedings, as in the coal strike.    They will seek their own independent advice in the same way.In the case of criminal proceedings the question of prosecutions is entirely one for the appropriate prosecuting authority., but it is theduty of the police to enforce the law.    It may be thought useful for police authorities to be informed of the advice which I have given in Part I ofthis paper.17.       In neither case is it possible for the Government to take directlegal action by commencing proceedings on its own account.    What is of vital importance is that information should be swiftly available.    It isonly useful if it is of such a nature that it can be translated into evidence which is receivable by a court.PRLaw Officers&apos; department March 1972 A
