STRATEGY, 1972INTRODUCTIONStrategically, 1972 is a crucial year for the Government.Approximately midway through this Parliament, it is now possibleto take stock as the measures introduced in and after 1970 begin totake effect. In a number of important areas the situation and prospectshave changed since the period before 1970 when that strategy wasdeveloped. A new impetus is needed to carry the Government intothe second half of the decade with a realistic theme embodied inwell-developed proposals. These must be generated in the remainder of 1972 and the early part of 1973.2  This paper is therefore divided into two parts:I. An attempt to assess the outcome of the original strategicimpetus and to identify areas where objectives have not been met.II. A discussion of whether the achievement of theseremaining objectives, when combined with the problems likelyto arise in the next few years, points to the continuance ordevelopment of the original strategy, or to the need for somethingnew.3 We conclude by recommending the study of particular sectorsabout which Ministers will have to make strategic decisions in thenext six to eight months, together with a method for such study.PART ISTOCKTAKING4 In discussion of our strategy paper at Chequers on 8 October,1971 (CP (71) 99), Ministers accepted the account we gave of theGovernments original strategy. In the following paragraphs wesummarise briefly the progress of that strategy.5 The Economy(a) Unemployment. Last year unemployment was unacceptablyhigh: despite successive reflationary measures it rose to over amillion in the winter. The April 1972 figures showed a national rate of4-2 per cent--in some regions a much higher rate still.
(b) Growth. After a period of stagnation output has begun to respond to expansionary measures. The Budget has provided a new,powerful stimulus aimed at 5 per cent growth over the next year.Business confidence at last shows tentative signs of improvement.(c) Inflation. The rate of price inflation has fallen back from10 per cent per annum in mid-1971 to 5^ per cent per annum in thepast six months. The rate of increase of wages has also fallen back,but not so sharply as that of prices.But: This is almost certainly only a lull.(d) Public expenditure. The general objective of containing thegrowth of public expenditure in the longer term has been increasinglyover-shadowed by the need to increase public expenditure in the short term to help reflate the economy. This has been largely doneby measures deliberately designed not to lead to longer-termincreases which would prejudice the Governments tax objectives.(e) Taxation and tax reform. The most important programmeof tax reform of the century is being progressively implemented.Indirect tax rates have been substantially reduced. The proportionof income taken in direct taxation has also been reduced.But: The effect of inflation is to erode the gain to the directtaxpayer. Because of the rapid rise in money incomes, the ratesof personal direct taxation suggested for 1973-74 probablymean that the real burden of direct taxation will be much thesame then as when the Government took office.6 Overseas Affairs and Northern Ireland(a) Europe. The successful negotiations to join the e.c. havenow been followed up by a Parliamentary campaign which should leave no obstacle to our accession on 1 January, 1973.But: Many firms in industry and in the City are not yet readyeither for the pressures or for the opportunities which EECmembership will bring; and the Governments own objectiveswithin the enlarged Community have not yet been worked outin detail. &apos;(b) Ireland. The Governments political initiative is an importantfirst step and has been well received.But: Violence continues and may, possibly, spread from Ulsterto Britain. Politically, direct rule only provides a limitedbreathing-space. A positive long-term policy has still to be developed.(c) Alliances. Britain&apos;s strength overseas relies on the health ofher alliances and the reality of her contribution to them. The
Government has made progress in three important areas, by increasing our contribution to NATO, settling the Malta crisis andnegotiating the Five-Power defence arrangements in the Far East.But: Our current contribution to NATO is lower than it shouldbe since 10 per cent of BAOR is temporarily in NorthernIreland.(d) Rhodesia. The Government made the best agreement withthe Smith regime which it looked like being able to implementwithout excessive international criticism.But: Lord Pearce&apos;s findings have made implementationimpossible, at least for the present.(e) International economic problems. The monetary crisis hasbeen temporarily defused and a retreat into protectionism checked.Britain&apos;s role in UNCTAD has been moderate and unobtrusive.But: The underlying problems of the world&apos;s trade and financialsystems persist. The Americans remain ambivalent in theirattitude to free trade and to the reserve role of the dollar.Japanese competition is a growing threat to European trade inthird markets as well as in Europe itself. Relations between the oil companies and Middle East governments are strained, not least because of demands for &quot; participation &quot;. As UNCTADhas shown, debt questions increase the tension betweendeveloped and developing countries. The latter continueto get relatively poorer.7 Industry(a) Disengagement. In the face of public concern abouthigh unemployment, the policy of disengagement from the private sector has suffered a number of setbacks. It has become apparent thatthere are circumstances in which the Government cannot stand aside.In recognition of this, the new Industrial Development Executive(IDE) has been established within the DTI, and plans to support anumber of advanced technological industries are nearingannouncement.But: We are in danger of excessive protectionism and of destroy-ing the competitive spur in certain areas.(b) Nationalised industries. Policy is in disarray. CloseGovernment supervision of the industries&apos; prices, wages and investment as a weapon in the battle against inflation and unemploy-ment has in most cases disrupted their finances and plans. It has alsoremoved any prospect of obtaining private sector participation.130184
(c) Investment incentives. Private industry has been givensubstantial incentives for investment, including in the last Budgetcountry-wide free depreciation and investment grants in assisted areas.Some nationalised industry investment has been brought forward totake up unused resources in the economy.But: Investment by private industry (particularly in the heavymechanical and electrical sectors) has remained seriously low.Large sections of industry will enter the e.c. in 1973 inunmodernised, uncompetitive shape.(d) Competition policy. The Governments promised legislation on competition has had to be postponed.But: This legislation in any case seems only marginally relevant to making British industry more competitive in an Europeancontext. The loss, if any, is probably to the consumer.(e) Agriculture. The recent price review, which provided a sound basis for transition to the Common Agricultural Policy, has substan-tially increased farmers&apos; incomes and encouraged output.8 Labour(a) The Industrial Relations Act was intended to introduce somelegal order into the industrial relations field and at the same time tohelp correct the balance between employers and large unions and between unions and their members.But: In the short term, the passing of the Act has set theGovernment and the unions in confrontation with each other,exacerbating the dissatisfaction already caused by the present rate of unemployment.(b) Retraining and mobility. A major expansion ofGovernment retraining is under way, fulfilling an important electionpledge.But: The target of 100,000 retraining places, which was ambitiouswhen it was formulated, looks less adequate in relation to presentunemployment levels. It will anyway need supplementing bysubstantial efforts by industry itself. Given the practices of localauthorities in allocating houses and the shortage of houses forsale, neither the increased removal grants nor the reform of housing finance look like producing a major improvement in labour mobility.
9 The RegionsRegional policy has been through a period of extensivere-examination.  Ministers have now  approved the new IDEorganisation within the DTI and a new range of investment incentives including the reintroduction of regional investment giants.But: It remains to be seen whether this will produce sufficientregeneration to make the regions competitive and to reducesubstantially in an acceptable timescale the differential in umemployment between the assisted areas and the rest of thecountry.10 The Environment(a) Housing. The Housing Finance Bill, providing for thecharging of economic rents with a national rebate scheme, advancesthe central strategy of helping only those in real need.But: The inflationary effect of this has still to be felt. the incentive to home ownership which this and other measures have provided is being frustrated by a continuing national shortageof houses for sale. The private rental sector is in unplanneddecline.(b) Transport. The objective of providing public transport only where it pays has had to be set aside where increased charges wouldhave contributed to inflation. The road programme continues on a major scale-But : All such programmes need to be related to a total national transport strategy.(c) The physical environment. Improvements will come from theGovernment^ major attack on the pollution of rivers and the sea;from the campaign to clear derelict land; from the legislation toban the dumping of toxic wastes; from &quot;Operation Eyesore&quot;;and from improved grants for slum clearance and houseimprovement.But: The Government has still to decide its priorities betweenenvironmental protection and other objectives, includingindustrial growth, and to develop a coherent policy for land usebalancing the claims of agriculture, amenity, housing andindustry. The main physical, economic and social problems ofthe urban environment remain.11  Social Affairs(a) Health and personal social services have seen the promisedincreases in expenditure (considerably greater than the growth of gnp and most on personal social services) and some of the promisedselectivity in subsidised provisions, though cost-related prescription130184B*
charges had to be abandoned. Extra provision was made in 1970 and1971 for the elderly and the mentally ill or handicapped. The NHSis being reorganised.(b) The social security system is being reconstructed on the basisof earnings-related contributions and flat-rate pensions, so as toencourage occupational pensions for all. Pensions and other benefits have been uprated by more than prices have risen; andcertain selective benefits (e.g. pensions for the over-80s and family income supplement) have been introduced and improved. Pensionsand supplementary benefits are to be uprated annually. This goessome way towards protecting the losers from inflation, the need forwhich we emphasised in our strategy paper last October.But: General upratings pre-empt resources which could other-wise be used for selective help for those most in need. No wayhas yet been devised of protecting existing private pensioners and others living on fixed incomes.(c) The Tax Credit system will simplify and improve benefits to families and pensioners; lessen the problem of high marginal taxrates around the poverty line; and enable Family Allowances to be abolished.But: It will be expensive to introduce.(d) Education. The original priority primary schools hasbeen effectively met with the help of resources shifted fromuniversities and of  100 million saved by curtailing free school milk and by increasing charges for school meals. The school-leaving ageis being raised and direct grant schools aided.(e) Law and order. A generous police pay settlement, anincreased prison building programme, expansion of the probationand after-care services and the Criminal Justice Bill carry out theGovernments pledge to devote more resources to law and order.The Immigration Act has been passed, in line with the pledge thatthere would be no more large-scale permanent immigration.But: Public confidence in authority is declining as minoritiesincreasingly resort to direct action after majority decisions havebeen made. Confidence in the police, after the recent corruptioncases and as violent crime gets steadily worse, is also suffering.Even though not yet in force, the Immigration Act may havesoured relations with the existing communities.12 The Role of Government(a) The projected reform of local government should improve efficiency, as should the associated changes in the administrationof water resources and of the NHS.
But: The conflict which we identified in our strategy paper last october, between the devolution inherent in the originalstrategy and centralised efficiency, continues to be decided against genuine devolution.(b) The improvement of central government was initiallytackled through the amalgamation of ministries, improved analysis of policy, the introduction of businessmen into Government andthe development of the Fulton concept of accountable units of management.But: The results of these measures have yet to be seen inquicker, better decision-taking. The pledge to reduce the size of the non-industrial Civil Service below 500,000 has proved impossible of achievement and has been abandoned.(c) Open government. The Government has demonstrated whateffective openness can mean by the extensive consultations whichhave accompanied its tax reforms.But: This has not always been matched in other areas, forinstance in information provided about the future of the economy.(d) Voluntarism. A Minister of State has been appointed at theHome Office as the co-coordinator of voluntary organisations. Somedirect financial help has been given and, more notably, taxconcessions have been embodied in the 1972 Budget.CONCLUSIONS ON THE 1970 STRATEGY13 There are considerable successes and achievements in the account given above of the 1970 strategy. But we are here concernedwith the generation of its successor, and so must pay special attentionto those areas where significant objectives have not been attained.In the next two paragraphs we identify the most important setbacksand highlight some of the reasons why policies which lookedreasonable in 1970 have not had the effect that was hoped for.14 In and before 1970, Ministers decided that if a modern reforminggovernment was to have a chance of success, it must set itself explicitstrategic objectives and pursue them with perseverance. The centralobjective was to be the achievement of fast growth in a high-wageeconomy, with increased welfare expenditure concentrated on thosereally in need. The situation in the last two years has been very different from that envisaged when the original policies to meet130184B* 2
these objectives were developed. In two respects it has improved:a large balance of payments surplus has temporarily removed the pressure on exchange rates; and the Chancellor has made clearthat he does not intend to allow such pressure to reassert the decisive role it once played in the management of the economy.On the other hand, inflation has been unexpectedly severe and unemployment unacceptably high. Productivity growth, welcome initself, has depressed employment even where output has expanded.In addition, open confrontation with the unions and an apparentdecline in confidence in authority have increased the difficulties ofgovernment by consent. Together, these new factors have produced a particularly hostile environment for many of the original economicand industrial policies.15 The problem for Ministers now is to assess how seriously thishostile environment has affected the elements of the original strategy.Clearly the main setbacks have been:(a) in industrial policy, where the theory of disengagement hadbeen developed for very different circumstances;(b) in the rapidity with which inflation has absorbed the massivedirect tax cuts;(c) in the slowness with which economic confidence has improved and the extent to which, even whereindustrialists have been more optimistic, unused capacityhas prevented significant increase in investment;(d) in the worsening in industrial relations, at least in the shortterm, as the Industrial Relations Act begins to be implemented; and(e) in the major setback caused by the miners&apos; strike to thepolicy of de-escalating wage settlements.16 In the next part of the paper we turn to consideration of the likely major problems of the next five years and try to analyse theextent to which, when combined with those problems upon whichthe 1970 measures have not so far had enough impact, they indicatehow the strategy should be developed. We have no doubt that the attempt to govern by reference to strategic objectives should continue.But the policies intended to achieve these may have to be modifiedif they prove unsatisfactory in practice; if the environment forwhich they were appropriate changes too far; or if the timescalefor their effective operation proves longer than was expected.Hence the need for regular strategic reviews.
PART IIPROBLEMS AHEAD17 Economic Problems(a) Unemployment is forecast to fall by some 100,000 between now and the first quarter of 1973.But: (i) The response of unemployment to the measures sofar taken is uncertain.(ii) Further action to reduce unemployment is likely to be needed either in 1973 or in the autumn of 1972.(b) Economic growth. The Government is now committed to separately of growth of 5 per cent for the next year. Continued fastgrowth will be essential if unemployment is to be brought down to more acceptable levels in 1973 and 1974.But: Substantial growth will lead to a deterioration in thebalance of payments.(c) Inflation. The miners&apos; award and the rail settlement haveweakened the de-escalation policy. There is a real risk that the CBIinitiative may crumble. There will be increasing pressure to raisenationalised industry prices considerably as part of the restorationof their finances. In addition, e.c. entry, rents and the introductionof VAT will be pushing up the cost of living in 1973. Overall,prices will once again be increasing at an annual rate of 10 per cent.This points to the possibility of another wage explosion within thenext year.(d) Public expenditure. If the Governments tax objectives areto be met, there will be little scope for further increases in public expenditure. This is a major constraint on new policies.18  Overseas Affairs and Northern IrelandThe speed and scope of European integration will be a source of controversy, both in Britain and in the enlarged Community.The need to steer e.c. policies in directions conducive to our interests will at times strain relations with our fellow-members. the reform of the international monetary system will be a difficultprocess in which Britain will have a major stake. Increasingtrade competition will be faced from Japan and new low-cost
producers, giving rise to pressure for protection. Demands for moregovernmental aid on freer terms will come from the third world.OPECs policies will force up oil prices and may at times interruptsupplies. In the absence of a Rhodesian settlement, it will be veryhard to devise a sanctions policy acceptable to Parliament without endangering our major interests in Black Africa. The Persian Gulf,Cyprus, Malta, Gibraltar and British Honduras may present us withrenewed problems. The Irish question will remain the worst headacheof all.19 Defence problems the defence of Europe will no longer be viable on the present basis, as Soviet military power increases, US force levels declineand European integration remains elusive. Britain will not wish togo on spending proportionately more on defence than her Europeanpartners, but existing policies will have to be modified unlessshe does. The military burden of Northern Ireland is unlikely to decrease. A Labour Government in Australia may upset our arrangements in the Far East.20 Industrial ProblemsWell before 1974, the problem of the nationalised industries&apos;relations with the Government (to which we have already referred)will have to be sorted out. In private industry, despite the measuresso far taken to increase companies&apos; liquidity and profitability and to induce them to invest, the effect of competition from the EECtogether with wage pressure is likely to cause continuingstructural change, involving further crises in declining industries.Private industry is becoming increasingly unwilling to support the anti-inflation policy at the cost of withstanding major strikes(e.g. Chrysler); and the finances of nationalised industries may befurther damaged if they are obliged to do so. The Governmentsrelations with the unions are such that it cannot base its policy onany assumption of voluntary co-operation. Many trades union leaders believe, rightly or wrongly, that a different governmentwould treat them better. But their attitude may alter if they expect the present Government to be re-elected.21  Social and Environmental ProblemsSocial stress will be increased by continuing inflation,unemployment and regional imbalance; by the decline in confidence in authority which we have already described; and by frustrationwith  working  conditions  as  expectations  rise.  Problems  of
resource allocation, even in conditions of satisfactory growth, willbecome more acute as pressure for across-the-board improvements(e.g. pensions) conflict with the need for selectivity (e.g. the disabled).Areas of justifiable public concern may be the problems of big cities,in particular those with racial difficulties; leisure and land use; drugaddiction; and aspects of family poverty such as one-parent families.Difficulty will be encountered in linking the needs of universities,schools and the teaching profession into a coherent educationalstrategy.22 Government and people the increasing complexity of the services provided by the State,and their labour intensive nature, means that a steadily expandingsegment of national resources is likely to be controlled by central and local government. At the same time, in the interests of efficiency, local government units are to become larger and somefunctions of national government will be transferred fromWestminster to Brussels. The report of the Commission on theConstitution may provide a focus for public controversy on thissubject. Thus, government will tend to get more remote at all levels and to appear increasingly unresponsive to the ordinary citizen.This alienation is likely to be an even more serious problem in thefuture; it may be reflected in falling turnouts at elections and increasingly violent and non-Parliamentary political activity.WHAT STRATEGY FOR THE FUTURE?23 These then are the major problems likely to face a Britishgovernment over the next few years. We now consider whether they,together with those now remaining after two years of the 1970strategy, can reasonably be approached in the spirit of that strategy,or whether its analysis and prescription are now obsolete.24 Future Stategy: The EconomyThe economic problem remains the most immediate andpressing. The Governments original objectives were the liberation of individual effort through restored incentives; improvement ofindustrial relations by a change in the balance of industrial power;and an expansionary macro-economic policy. Changes in thesituation have not been such as to cast doubt on the priority ofthese objectives rather the opposite. Of the major programmes so
far initiated in furtherance of them, almost all have long time-lagsbefore they will produce significant improvements. Ministers nowneed to consider, however, their approach to the three major issues of the next 2-3 years: the wages explosion of 1973; the management of the balance of payments; and the level to which unemploymentmust be reduced. The first of these issues is the one for which theGovernment is least prepared. Does this suggest a moreinterventionist policy? Or is effective intervention impossible?25 Future Strategy: Foreign Affairs and defence in foreign affairs, the basic elements of the strategy shouldcontinue to be recognition of the limits of our influence; pursuit ofour national interests rather than of a great-Power role; andconcentration on Europe. Our e.c. policy will require clarity aboutlong-term objectives; well-ordered priorities between more immediate aims; and a readiness to bargain tenaciously andpurposefully, on the French model, e.g. by trading off our consent to agricultural price increases against help for our regional problems.Between European problems and,our own financial constraints, arestructuring of defence policy in the later &apos;70s seems inevitable and should be considered as soon as possible because of the longtime-leads involved. As regards the developing world, the scope for purely British policies is limited; but we shall want to play our part in the evolution of outward-looking e.c. policies.26  Future Strategy: IndustryBoth for nationalised industries and private industry the originalstrategy has had to be substantially modified, although the basicrationale for that strategy still holds good. For nationalised industries, the aim must be to restore to commercial viability those industries capable of it. In other cases, where there are strong socialreasons for their continued operation at particular levels or inparticular areas, the Government must decide how much it isprepared to pay for these social benefits. But policies consistent withthe need for price restraint must be formulated for every industryand adhered to if managerial competence and control ^of costs arenot to deteriorate further. As regards private industry, even withimproved profitability, the Government is going to have to intervene in some cases. But a policy of alldwing management and labour to besubject so far as possible to commercial disciplines will be vital asBritain fits herself into the competitive framework of the e.c.. Thissuggests that the Government needs urgently to define the purposes for which it is prepared to intervene. In their dealings with the unionsMinisters will need to use both stick and carrot. There is no shortageof carrots; but the Industrial Relations Act may not be a big enoughstick.
27  Future Strategy: Social and Environmental AffairsTackling the social problems of the next years will call forfurther reform of the process of government itself. The aim mustbe to make the welfare machine better able to identify those groups in most need of help. This further progress of the original selectivitywill require more sophistication in the flow and handling of the government&apos;s information. Given the strong pressure on limited resources, the tensions within the welfare services between universaland selective provision will have, in our view, to be settled in favourof selectivity. A concerted approach is also necessary in areas suchas housing, education and leisure where social and environmentalissues are closely related.28  Future Strategy: Government and people in the past, alienation of citizens from government has tended to decline with the improvement of economic conditions. Thereare signs that it may not happen this time, and specific efforts to remedy this situation will probably be necessary. It is no longersufficient to improve the citizen&apos;s material standard of life: thequalitative element is increasingly important. Openness andresponsiveness to the citizen&apos;s needs, devolution and accountabilitywere and are the right watchwords. They may be carried forward by the consideration now being given to openness; by strengthening the Governmenfs work on behalf of the consumer; by improved and streamlined procedures for public participation in planningdecisions; by the establishment of effective principles for what should or should not be devolved away from the centre; and by theimprovement of rights of redress against the executive.CONCLUSIONS29  Our main conclusions are : , .(i) The  original  objectives  of  improving  incentives  andfostering growth should be maintained, notwithstandinga deterioration in the balance of payments.(ii) The Government has at present no answer to the threatthat serious wage and price inflation will recur in 1973.(iii) Foreign and defence policy, already effectively centredupon Europe, should become more explicitly so.(iv) Industrial  policy  should  be  urgently  redefined  and developed.
(v) The objective of selectivity in social welfare and themachinery for it should be refined and developed.(vi) The Government should take care to match its increasingscale of operation with increased awareness of theindividual.30 If Ministers accept these conclusions, the original majorobjectives of the 1970 strategy still effectively hold. Incentives for theindividual, selectivity in welfare, reform of industrial relations,European integration and a consistent growth policy will remain the right priorities in 1975, if to them are added a new attack oninflation and a new emphasis on the need for greater responsivenessby Government to the needs of the citizen. With these objectives astrategy for the rest of the decade can be generated.RECOMMENDATION31 Ministers should recognise that a new input of political thoughtis now needed if the Governments momentum is not to be lost.We believe that special &quot; Strategy Groups &quot; of Ministers should be formed to provide this input. If this is agreed, the CPRS would propose to arrange for such groups to study the following topics:(a) Government and the citizenib) Industrial policy:(i) Nationalised industries(ii) Private sector(iii) Industrial relations(c) Europe(d) Defence(e) Social affairs(/) The environmentMinisters may wish to revise this list if the Chequers discussionsuggests other areas of greater strategic importance.
