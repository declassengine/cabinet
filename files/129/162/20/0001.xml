DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 45 COPY NO       U s/21 April 1972CABINETINTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE EXCHANGE EQUIPMENTMemorandum by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications1. The Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy (EPC) at their meeting on 29 March considered a paper (Annex A) by the then Ministerfor Aerospace and my predecessor about a Post Office proposal, followinginternational tendering, to import equipment for a new telephone exchange.They recognised the employment advantages of accepting Plessey&apos;s tenderbut felt they were outweighed by the commercial advantages (much lowerprice, cheaper maintenance, greater assurance of timely delivery) of that by L M Ericsson of Sweden.2. The Prime Minister, to whom this conclusion was reported,stressed the employment consequences of diverting abroad work whichwould otherwise go to factories in the North East of England and suggestedthat, in the circumstances, Plessey might be persuaded to reduce theirtender.3,        The matter has therefore been considered further by Departments;Plessey have made representations to the Department of Trade andIndustry and to me, and they have been in direct negotiation with thePost Office.    The results are summarised in Annex B.4. In sum, although the position as reported to EPC has changedsignificantly in detail, the choice remains a very difficult one.    Ericssonsare still much cheaper in price ( 14, 3 million, against  17. 6 million);their maintenance costs are lower (capital value  2 million); their equipment is generally more efficient; the Post Office place muchgreater reliance on their ability to deliver on time.    It will not beat all easy to convince the Post Office Board that the Ericsson tendershould be rejected and that they should accept public responsibility,without compensation, in order to minimise international complications.These are in any event likely to be serious in relation to the european free Tre.de Area,    It appears that the employment consequences ofgiving the work to Plessey (and conversely the redundancy consequences of not doing so) may have been exaggerated: and the Post Office can inany event commit themselves to another large international exchangecontract (value  12- 13 million) with Plessey which could do much to offset the loss of this one.
5. Nevertheless, to give the contract to Plessey would generateemployment in the North East at a cost which, though highs is not outof scale with earlier expenditure in relief of unemployment in the country.6, The final date for the Post Office to reach a decision was originally 31 March.    This was then extended to 14 April, and a further period of grace was subsequently negotiated.    It is highly iesirable toavoid further delay,    I should be grateful, accordingly, for an earlyCabinet decision on the matter.J EMinistry of Posts and Telecommunications20 April 19722
ANNEX a post OFFICE PROPOSAL TO  IMPORT equipment for AN  INTERNATIONAL TELEPHONE EXCHANGEMemorandum by  the Minister of Posts  and telecommuncations and  the Minister  for Aerospace1.      The Post Office have  sought  international   tenders  forcrossbar eqtiipment  for  a new international  exchange.    the outcome  is  an offer  from L M Ericsson of Sweden,   having  thefollowing advantages over one  from Plessey,   the  only UnitedKingdom supplier of   the particular kind of  equipment  involved:Pr *ce:      14.28M compared with at  least   22.3M fromPlessey;(ii)    Ma i n t maintenance:     the Ericsson equipment  is  expected  to cost   the Post Office   150,000  a year  less  in running coststhan  the Plessey equipment,   and  there would also besavings  in space and power  costs;(iii)    Cost  escalation:     the Ericsson quotation is  firm forthree years whereas Plessey reserve  the right  to vary prices in  later years.Delivery dates  are virtually  the  same  for both  tenders butEricsson1s  record internationally  is  good whereas Plessey&apos;srecord has been poor,   though perhaps  for reasons which may notrecur.2.       Hitherto,   all  equipment  for   telephone  exchanges  in  theUnited Kingdom whether for  inland or  international  exchanges,has  been supplied by British factories.    The  three main suppliersare G.C,  Plessey  and STC.    The Post Office do not consider  it practicable  to  import equipment  for normal  exchanges because there would need  to be  five or  six years of  adaptive engineeringto make  it  suitable   to operate  in  the United Kingdom environmentwith other equipment which  is  already  there.3.      This new  international  exchange  is,  however,   exceptionalin  that  it does not have  full  facilities  for  interconnectionwith other exchanges;   it will be  an adjunct of  another  exchangebeing provided by Plessey and will  consist more or  less of standard units   to be used for handling directly-dialled calls  toand  from the Continent.    Other  international  exchanges  in thePost Officers  programme  are planned  to have  the  full  range  of(CON FIDE JMTJAL)&apos;
(confidential)facilities which can only be  supplied by Plessey equipment.Thus a decision  to  import would have no bearing on  the questionof  supply of  equipment  for  the  inland network where other more complex considerations  apply.4.      At  an earlier stage  a number of  objections  to   thisproposal   for overseas&apos;  procurement were  considered,   inparticular  (a)   foreign Companies anxious   to gain entry  intothe United Kingdom market would be prepared to quote below costand  (b)  British manufacturers would  suffer  in export markets  ifthe Post Office selected foreign suppliers.    On  (a)   the PostOffice have confirmed that Ericsson&apos;s  charges   to  the Dutchadministration are consistent with  the  figures  quoted  in  thecurrent Ericsson&apos;s   tender.    Moreover,   50% of Ericsson&apos;s  business is  for  export and  this  does not,   therefore,   appear  to be a caseof marginal  export   trade  being  carried on  the  back of  aprosperous home  trade.    On  (b) Ericsson do not need  this contract   to boost  their   international  prestige,   which  is  alreadyhigh.    Unfortunately,  British firms  are not yet strong  in modernswitching equipment  and  their version of  crossbar  is  not  sellingabroad since  it  is   too expensive  -  as   the present  tenderindicates  -  and delivery dates  are   long.5.      The Board of   the Post Office  is unanimous   that   the Ericssontender should be  accepted.    The differences  between  the  bidsfrom Plessey and Ericsson are  so great   that,   in other circumstan-ces,  we  should not  feel   justified  in  intervening.     Since,however,   the Plessey  equipment would  be manufactured mainly  inSunderland and South Shields  and would creatEover the next 2j years,000 additional jobs (two  thirds female), we felt we should seek the views of theCommittee.    The DTI  calculate  that  a subsidy representing   thedifference between  the bids  for  the  sake  of  generating employmentcannot  be  justified on resource cost  grounds.6.      The Chairman has  indicated  that  if   they are  to be  told to accept   the Plessey  tender  they would wish  to have  a writtendirective which would have  to be published an d/ or  compensation.Either of   these courses would create difficulties  in relation  toour EFTA obligations,   and even  if  compensation were  concealed itwould be extremely embarrassing  if   it ever came  to  light.     if no publishable directives can be given and we decide  on employment grounds   to favour Plessey,   it will be necessary  there-fore  for strong pressure   to be  exerted,  which may be unsuccessfulCONCLUSIONS7.      We  feel   that,   taking  all   the  circumstances   into  account,the Post Office&apos;s  choice  should be  allowed  to  stand.    But  inview of  the employment  repercussions,   we  seek  the concurrence of   the Committee.C. J. C.F.  V.  C.Ministry of Posts  and Telecommunications24 March  1972
ANNEX BOUTCOME OF FURTHER CONSIDERATION AND DISCUSSIONS WITH PLESSEYRedundancyPlessey claim not only  that  there will  be  some 2,000  jobopportunities  lost   in  their  factories  if   they  fail   to  sectire  this contract  but  that some of   these would be represented by redundancies(500  in  1972/73 and  further  redundancies   in   later years).     Given   thatthere  is  a  large  labour   turnover  in   the  factories  concerned and arising volume of work  for  the Post Office on other business,   one cannot be certain  that Plessey&apos;s  fears  about  redundancies willmaterialise.     In any  case  the Post Office are proposing   to advance the order for  their next  international   exchange   (which only Plesseycan supply)   and,   in  the  event  of   the  other order  for  specialequipment going   to LME,   the Post Office would announce   the newPlessey order simultaneously.    This  should mitigate still&apos; furtherany redundancy problem  that may  arise.Job Opportunities  It  is  difficult  for Departments   to  challengePlessey&apos;s  assessment of   the   job opportunities   involved althoughPost Office probing  suggests   that  the  figure may have  been overstatedby a factor of   three.    Even  if   this were  so,   the difference betweenthe  two original   tenders would still  represent  a subsidy per  jobyear of  about  5,000 only,   which  is  of   the  same order as  that paid for   the   infra-structure tare  packages   last  year.     (And   Lhe differencebetween  the bids   is now much  lower  -  see below).Discussion with PlesseyThe Post Office originally  took  the view that  it would be wrong for them  to  attempt  to put pressure on Plessey.    They  thought  itunethical  and  they had already assured Ericssons  that   theiropportunity  to tender was genuine.    They were  also concerned  (sincemany of  their contracts with United Kingdom companies  are still  on a cost/plus basis)   that  if Plessey were   to accept  a  loss  on  thisparticular  job  they would simply add  to   their   on   costs  for otherjobs.    However,   on Wednesday   12   April,   Plessey indicated  to DTI   thatthey would be willing  to reduce  their   tender by about  8 million  forthe equipment  actually  specified by  the Post Office.    This would cover the whole difference  in  initial  cost  between  the  two bids but notthe advantage  in maintenance  costs   (present value about   2 million)associated with  the LME bid.    The Minister  for  Industrial development and I  considered  this would make  a helpful  contribution  towardssolving  the problem and Plessey were  invited  to approach  the PostOffice.     In  the  event,  Plesseys have not been  able   to offer anything like  this.    After negotiating with   the Post Office  the most   they can offer  is  about  5 million  towards  closing   the  gap of  10 million.This revised  offer    involves  development engineering which  increasesPost Office doubts  about  their  ability  to deliver on  time.    Plesseysay they  could save  a further  l-j million by  importing  substantial quantities of  components  from  their overseas  factory  in Brazil.However,   the  case  for our  intervening  on employment  grounds would bethat much lessened.    On  the other  side,   it   transpires   that LME,   ifthey get   the  contract,   will  spend 4 5% of   the  contract price  in  thiscountry.
EFTATo award  the contract   to Plessey would be a flagrant  breach ofour commitments   to EFTA.    EFTA  is,   of  course,   coming  to an end,   andthe  immediate  international  row would,   therefore,   be  limited,   but  itmight  affect our  trading  interests  as  a whole,   and  the United kingdom has an  important  interest  in keeping public contracts open to international  competition.    The United Kingdom has  recently  securedabout   30 million worth of  such contracts   from Sweden -  and Plesseyare also  involved.    The e.c. are considering a draft directive on public purchasing,   and Sweden has  said  in  its  bilateral  discussions with  the Commission  that  it wants provisions  on public purchasingincluded.     But   the e.c. draft  directive  is not  in  force,   and many ofthe e.c. countries do at present protect  their own  industries.    Aparticular difficulty  is   that   there  is  a Ministerial meeting of EFTAin May,   and  if   the  award  to Plessey  is  announced before  then mycolleagues might have a difficult  session.Attitude of Post Office board the Chairman of   the Board has   indicated  that   they would require a publishable  letter or directive  and compensation before  settingaside  the LME  tender.    But  this  is  virtually ruled out  because of  ourEFTA commitments.     The more   the Government  is  seen  to  intervene  the worse  for our  relations with EFTA,   etc.    As  for  compensation,   thereare no  statutory powers  and  legislation would compound  the offence   toEFTA.     It  is   thought   that  if maximum pressure were applied  theChairman himself would probably be prepared  to accept  a government decision but   there must  be  some doubt whether he could persuade ailof his  Board not  only   that  this  was   the  right  policy  but   that   theymust accept  responsibility for it.    Any resignations  from  the Boardon  this   issue would be undesirable  from  the EFTA point of view.Effect on Suppliers and UnionsBoth Lord Nelson  (G.C)  and Sir John Clark (Plessey)  have  stressed that  the award of   this  contract  to Ericssons might have a serious effect on  the confidence  and export potential  of   the  telecommunicationsindustry generally.    Plessey also warn   that   the Trade Unions mayreact strongly  to  the  award of   the contract abroad.    On  the  otherhand,   the Plessey   tender was  originally more   than  50% above   theEricsson bid  (and  is  still more  than 30% higher).     The UnitedKingdom  industry must become more  competitive  in relation  to foreignsuppliers.    The proposal by  the Post Office  to advance  the order  forthe next  international   exchange worth  12 million and announce  itsimultaneously with  the  acceptance of   the LME bid could  to  someextent help offset any adverse  effect   the British  telecommunicationsindustry might otherwise suffer.19 Apri1   197 2
