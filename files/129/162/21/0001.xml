DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S government cp(72) 46 COPY NO    6 324 April 1972CABINETPROMOTION OF COUNCIL HOUSE SALESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the environment. At their meeting on 21 April the Home and Social Affairs committee invited me to consult the Cabinet urgently on how we might best increasethe sale of council houses.2.        Since we took office we have lifted the restrictions on salesimposed by our predecessors.    Sales have increased from 6, 000 in 1970to nearly 17, 000 in 1971.    But the decision to sell is by law a matter foreach local authority.    Many councils (not all of them Labour controlled)refuse to sell.    Their number is likely to go up after the municipalelections in May.    At the same time more tenants will wish to buy as aresult of the rent increases under the Housing Finance Bill.    If theycannot buy their present home, they will add to the demand for privatehouses to buy and so will contribute to forcing up house prices particularlyin the lower price range.   It would help to bring supply more quickly into line with demand if we could secure a substantial increase in council housesales.    To do so would be popular with the majority but not all of our supporters,3,        Our dilemma is that we could only be sure of achieving this aimby compulsion.    At the same time to curtail the freedom of localauthorities further would antagonise many of them at a time when we needtheir good will in implementing the Housing Finance and Local government bills,4.        There are four possible options before us:-(1)        We could give every tenant the right to purchase his house,though with the reservation that local authorities could ask theSecretary of State to make exceptions in particular cases; eg. alocal authority might argue that it needed to keep a pool of rentedhouses to maintain the right mix of population.(2)       We could place a duty on local authorities to put forwardschemes for selling a proportion of council houses and give theSecretary of State power to amend such schemes if he thought theminadequate.1
(3)       We could put a duty on local authorities to reviewcontinuously the exercise of their existing power to sell council houses, having regard to the wishes of their tenants and to anyguidance given them by the Secretary of State.    This would alsoempower the Secretary of State to require authorities to report tohim on their exercise of this duty, and, if he considered that any authority was failing to exercise it properly, to require them(within say 3 months) to submit proposals fdr its proper exercise.(4)       We could issue a strongly worded circular exhorting everylocal authority to meet the Government1 s wish that tenants who wished to buy their home should be able to do so.5.        Courses 1 and 2 would require a substantial Bill.    The first would achieve the desired result;  and the second would have a reasonable prospect of so doing.    Both would antagonise the local authorities.Course 3 would only require a short Bill but although it would probablyinfluence a number of local authorities to do what we want, we would haveno means of forcing them to do this.6. Course 4 would call for no legislation but might be accompaniedby the threat of legislation in the form of courses 1, 2 or 3, if it provedineffective.7,        The best choice seemed to the Committee to lie betweenCourses 3 and 4.    Both these would place on each local authority theresponsibility for furthering their tenants aspirations to home ownership and the odium of any frustration of those aspirations.    Course 3 wouldenable us to meet the Opposition^ attack on the rent increases under theHousing Finance Bill by saying that those tenants who do not qualify forrebates should be allowed to buy their homes.    But Course 4 might bemore effective in the long run particularly if we were prepared to followit up by a major measure to give council tenants the right to purchase their home compulsorily,8. I would like to make a statement on this subject at 3rd Reading ofthe Housing Finance Bill which is to occupy a whole day (probably duringthe week after next). ,9.        I accordingly invite the Cabinet to consider:1, Whether we should go for a short Bill on the lines set out inparagraph 4(3), or a strong circular with a threat to legislate(paragraph 4(4).2.        If the course described in paragraph 4(4) above is adopted,whether we should threaten legislation now if the response to the circular is unsatisfactory, or whether we should &quot;wait and see&quot; and,if appropriate, legislate later.P w department of the Environment24 April 1972 confident^.
