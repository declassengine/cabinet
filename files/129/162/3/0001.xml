BRITISH RAILWAYS^ PAY CLAIMMemorandum by the Minister for Transport industries.     I was invited at the meeting of the Cabinet on 2 March to circulate a paper on the railway negotiations.2.     The present pay agreement runs until the end of April.   The Unions,National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), Society of Allied Locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) and Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) have asked for a &quot;substantial increase&quot;.   At the most recent meeting, on 24 February,figures between 11 per cent and 21 per cent were mentioned but nothing was precise.They gave the impression they were looking for something about 15 per cent.3.     Two days of negotiation are scheduled for 7 and 8 March.   This willgive British Railways a much clearer idea of what level of settlement is practicable.   But they believe that, unless the Unions feel   that asettlement is within &quot;knocking distance&quot;, the talks will, break down.4.     If the negotiations continue, it would be normal for the talks to be adjourned for a week.   There is, however, a Railways Board meeting on9 March, so if a hear-breakdown situation were reached British Railwayscould ask for a day*s adjournment, which would give the Board and theGovernment a chance to review the situation.5.     It is almost certain that the Unions would give at least seven days1notice of a national strike.   In Mr Marsh1s view it could well suit themtactically to time a strike for April rather than the end of March.   ButASLEF*s unofficial action would almost certainly start as soon as the talks broke down;   this could, if widespread, cause serious difficulties./
\0 Lra &apos;tzn pTHE EFFECTS OF THE WILBERFORCS REPORT6. Wilberforce, and in particular paragraph 30 of the report, is justwhat the railway unions have been waiting for.    They are likely tomake good use of it in pursuing two main, but conflicting,objectives:-i. To raise basic rates at the bottom of the scale (NUR);ii. To restore lost differentials (ASLEF).h While the public may not have the same sympathy with railwaymenbecause their work is not so obviously unpleasant, their case has anumber of similarities with that of the miners.    Their principalarguments will be:-i. Major manpower reductions have taken place with unionco-operation.    The 1971 railway workforce (about 270,000) was only53% of the number in I960 (about $lo.,000).   A further reductionof about 12^o (about 26,000 posts) is envisaged by the Boardbetween 1971 and 1977. &quot; iii. A substantial proportion of raili^aymeri are among&apos;&apos;&apos;the lowerpaid.   About 29,000 men are on the minimum basic rate ( 17.20,with guaranteed minimum earnings of  18.25).   The NUR will argue that these men should at least be on a par with their oppositenumbers in the electricity, gas and water supply * industries, whose   Ibasic rates were recently increased by about 10%.    For this reason -jthe NUR are most unlikely to be satisfied with anything less than 19* and a guaranteed minimum earnings level of  20.    But they may   jargue for something nearer the .post-Wilberforce rate of  23 for coal industry surface workers.   A minimum basic rate of  19 wouldmean an increase of 10-g^ on the basic rate.    The total wage-billcost of this would depend on consequential increases to othergrades.    But because bonus payments are not linked to basic rates10-gfo increase on the minimum basic rate might cost about 9^ onthe wage bill.    The Unions tend to relate increases to basic ratesrather than earnings because the percentage figure is largeriii. Drivers, once among the elite of industrial workers. have been steadily losing ground to other railwaymen for sometime (see Annex3).The so-called &quot;Penzance agreement&quot; of 1,966 has resulted in erosionof the&quot; real- value of the drivers&apos; mileage and bonus payments.    In1967* before the &quot;Penzance agreement&apos;!, the average pay of driverswas \\Q% higher than a porter;    it is&apos;now 2%%.    The pressure to restore historic levels is strong.iv. Working conditions are often onerous.   Whilst there is nothing comparable to the unpleasantness of underground work, the train crews&apos; roster is burdensome.    For example, a typical seriesof shifts might involve starts, in consecutive x^eeks, at 2 am;     pm;6 am; 12 noon; 12 midnight; and 7 pm..    Some men are liable to becalled on in all weathers and at all hours, for example dealing withaccidents and emergency repairs.2
v.    Productivity has been inadequately rewarded.    It is true that the- the q.0;o increase in train miles per BR   employee achieved between1 %0 and 1971 would not have been possible without union co-opera-tion in a major job-restructuring.    Against this it counts thatearnings have also increased considerably.    Between 1 96O and 1971average weekly earnings of all railway wages grades increased byabout M\5% (against 107^ for all manufacturing industry;    91$ for miners).THE BOARD1S NEGOTIATING STRATEGY8. British&apos;Railways will attempt to meet the Unions&apos; tx^o main points by concentrating on the lower paid workers and the drivers1 differentials.9. They intend to play a slow game during J/iS March.   Their objective willbe to end with an adjournment with the prospect of a settlement abouta week later. -The talks will start with a general appreciation of thenational economic and industrial background.    The financial position ofthe railways will be dealt with in detail.    The Board will lead into the detailed negotiations with the general message:    don&apos;t expect too much -but we want to give railwaymen a fair deal.10. Because of the nature of the Railways&apos; pay structure the detailed- negotiations will be immensely complicated.    There are 17 main basicgrades to be considered, and a much larger number of less important ones 1(ranging from chauffeurs to hostel attendants).    Any particular approachinvolves a large number of variations within this range.    The unions have in the past insisted on maintaining a number of links between different grades, and these have to be carefully assessed in relation -to each possible offer.    The Board have made detailed preparations andhave worked out the implications of more than a dozen differentapproaches.    The precise nature of an overall offer by the Board cannotbe predicted in advance.    It will take shape during negotiations,11. The Board have prepared the following approaches: .^ -    .. -V.&quot; 1 -. J .   .i. A common cash increase across the board:    this would favour the lowest paid workers.    It would satisfy the main element of NUR;but not ASLEF or TSSA.     -ii. A common percentage increase to basic rates across-the-board!:this.would maintain differentials, and would be favourable to thehigher paid,iii. A tapered increase-: --this would-bo  ^compromise between optionsi. and ii. above.    It might take a form of a common cash award acrossthe-&quot;board together with a common percentage increase on basic rates.It would not meet present dissatisfactions with the differentials,nor remove anomolies within the pay structure.3
(secret)iv.   Consolidation of bonus into basic rates of pay: this would begin to correct anomolies between the bonus and non-bonus earners.   It would alsogo part way towards meeting the unions&apos; claim to unfreeze bonus and mileagepayments from their pre-Penzance rates.12. The Board will, of course, start at a figure a3 low as is realistic and negotiatefrom that basis.   Their present estimate is that a settlement might in the end bepossible at a wage bill cost of about 10 to 11 per cent. They believe that, unlessthe Unions sense there is a prospect of doing business at about this level, talkswill break down.J13, A hypothetical &quot;worst possible&quot; railwaymans pay case, of the sort which might beproduced by the Unions to gain public sympathy, is illustrated at Annex 7.ARBITRATION;if. S 137(2)(a) of the Transport Act 1968 requires the Railways Board to set up&apos;negotiating arrangements which include provision for arbitration.   Agreements withthe unions provide for disputes concerning salaried and &quot;conciliation&quot; staff to bereferred to the Railway Staff National Tribunal.   Either party may refer a dispute;in such cases a decision would not be binding.   Decisions on a joint reference by both sides would be binding.Ij15. The Tribunal consists of a Chairman and two members.   The Chairman^ post has beenvacant for a year following the death of Professor A J Robertson.   ProfessorYfedderburn was a name put forward by the Union side.   He has been invited informallyon behalf of both sides to fill the vacancy.   He has indicated that he would be willing to serve, subject to satisfaction of certain minor queries about theterms of appointment and the likely work-load.   The final step, which is a formaljoint invitation from the Board and Unions, has yet to be taken.FINANCIAL POSITION16. British Railways Finances are in a poor state and are getting worse.They lost some  15 million in 1971.   In 1972, the CBI initiative has already&apos;made necessary a grant of  27 million.   The coal strike will probably cost afurther  10 million.   The Board have budgeted for a 7? per cent overall wage increase this year each percentage point above this adds  4- million in a full year toa total pay bill of about  2jX)0 million.   In 1973, even with price increasessubstantially higher than 5 per cent a loss of  20 million now looks likely.   a continuation of the 5 per cent restraint would more than double this.17. Their ability to argue the poor state of their finances has been seriouslyundermined by paragraph 30 of the Wilberforce report proposing government finance for pay settlements which cannot be financed commercially without an unacceptable reduction in manpower. /COURSES OPEN TO THE GOVERNMENT18. The Chairman, who intends to play&apos; the negotiations slowly, expectsnot to intervene himself during the 7th and 8th.   In offering guidance to the Chairman, my colleagues will need to have in mind what is their(secret)NW^M,MwiiwB^iniiiimirwii ill-
(IDprime objective;    to sustain the policy of de-escalation or toprevent a rail strike.    They could therefore be asked:-a. to limit their offer to the current norm of 7 to 3%of tne present wage bill.    The British. railways vie;/ Is thatsuch a low offer would be completely unacceptable not only toASLEP but to NTJR and would almost certainly precipitate astrike.    This percentage limit would make it impracticable toput forward a   reasonable package covering both the NUR and ASLEPdemands;b. limit the offer to within J\0$.    British Railways consider thatthere is just a chance of reaching a settlement at this level.    Butthere would still be a strong possibility that ASLEP would not regard this as a negotiable offer and would resort to strike action;c. as a variation .of b. limit the offer to within 10% in thefirst round of negotiations and tc review tne situation in theevent of failure.    This would give British Railways reasonablescope for negotiation and for adjournment without a major risk ofbreakdown. . The situation could then be reviewed with a betterknowledge of the Unions&apos; demands;d. authorise an offer up to 12^.    This is the lowest figure which gives any real assurance of a settlement quickly, but there would still be some risk of ASLEF sticking out for a higher figure;i .&apos; &apos;e. seek the lowest settlement possible.    British Railways would,in their own interests, keep this as low as practicable, but a&quot;blank cheque&quot; could be very damaging for incomes policy;f. encourage a reference to arbitration.    The railway unions would be opposed to any separate court of inquiry and would press for reference to the Railway Staff Tribunal with the Chairman welldisposed to them.   With several Wilberforce points in favour of theUnions, this is only too likely to produce a second &quot;whollyexceptional&quot; case.m-i The possibility of a cooling off period which is being dealt with ina paper by the Secretary of State for Employment would only arise afterthe next round of negotiations.20. To sum up.    The British Railways negotiating position has been seriouslyi weakened by Wilberforce.    There is some possibility of a settlement not greatly in excess of the present norm.   ASLEP would not hesitate to strike if they considered the offer to be unacceptable.    The effects ofan early national rail strike would be immediate and severe.    Industry. 5/S ic O fx c 1
C$ EC RET)and the public generally after their recent difficulties would react strongly against the prospect of another strike, but hostility to the railway men would not necessarily, be accompanied by symapathy for the Government.2i, I therefore support the recommendation of the Ministerial meeting on1st March (as in c. above) that the Chairman of British Railways shouldbe authorised to go for a settlement within a total cost of 1 Qf0 of thepresent wage bill.    If a settlement within this limit did not prove possible on 7th/8th March, the negotiations should be adjourned andMr Marsh should consult again immediately with the Government.J P6
