INDUSTRIAL ACTION ON THE RAILWAYSNote by the Chairman of the Official Committee on Emergencies1. I was invited to set out the forms of industrial action which theunions might take in the present rail pay dispute; the effects of each course;and the contingency plans in each case.    The direct effects of a possiblerail strike can be predicted with reasonable confidence.    It is much lesseasy to predict the effects of industrial action at various levels short of astrike.    The attitude of other unions would be crucial to the effectiveness of the possible counter-measures,,A. SPORADIC AND/OR LOCAL ACTION2.        This could take many forms, from a national one-day strike to individual localised action by militant branches.    The localised action could include work-to-rule, a ban on ovortioaa or rest day working, orany combination of these,3.        The effects would be irritant.    The more severe measures like a national one-day stoppage would require previous announcement;  somesteps could thus be taken to minimise the impact,4,        Except for the one-day national stoppage, little contingency planningis practicable or necessary.    Neither a Proclamation nor a restraintorder would be justified.    For the one-day stoppage, traffic plans for london and the conurbations are needed and exist.B. ORGANISED AND LARGE-SCALE PARTIAL ACTION5.        This could be a ban on overtime and on rest day and Sunday working.Working to rule is also possible and has wide scope, though it has not been much used in the past.    Action of this kind could be sustained for a longtime,6,        The effects would depend on the degree of action, and so cannot be closely predicted.    In 1968, action of this form allowed 90 per cent of priority freight to continue; on the oth**? hand some passenger services were down to 50 per cent,&apos;-. f7,        The results could range from great inconvenience to widespreadharm.    Trade and industry would take its own defensive steps,    Londoncommuters would have a rough time, and traffic congestion would becomesevere.    If coal deliveries to power stations were cut by no more than halfof current rate, it should be possible to maintain electricity supply withoutdrawing significantly on stocks; but this would depend on how far industrial action was particularly directed against the power stations,
8. The use of alternative transport for some purposes would be easierthan in a full strike. But very extensive use could provoke the unions to go further,9. Partial action would need to be closely monitored by departments and the Committees on emergencies.    So long as it was not too severe orother unions did not back it, there would be no call for a Proclamation ofan emergency.    Large-scale picketing would seem unlikely.    contingency planning is limited to traffic measures, plus the managerial initiatives oftrade and industry,10,       If the industrial action was severe or other unions backed it, thesituation could constitute an emergency, justifying emergency powers andthe introduction of contingency plans which have been reported to the ministerial Committee on Emergencies and are summarised in Annex A,C.        FULL STRIKE11,        If there were a full strike (which assumes no restraint order or thefailure of a restraint order) this would halt all rail movements, includingcoal, oil and certain other essential commodities as well as commuterservices.    The support of other unions would prevent the substitution of road transport, and might extend further in the light of counter-measuressuch as the use of troops, volunteers and the Industrial Relations Act,Electricity rationing, to the February level, with its impact on industry,would be necessary at once.    Even thens electricity endurance might wellbe less than a strike which lasted two months and it is for consideration whether one could count on public morale lasting so long,12.       The direct effects of a full strike are summarised in Annex B.    Thesituation would, of course, at once create a State of Emergency, calling for full emergency powers and immedSa$i&amp; implementation of some contingencyplans.
ANNEX a contingency planning the main elements of contingency planning are:-1.     The DOE-based Emergency Transport Organisation, with a regional sub-structure, to see that road transport is used to besteffect, and as far as possible to cover necessary movement of an agreed list of priority traffic.2.     Provision in Emergency Powers for relaxation of restrictionson use of road transport, for direction of its use and for regulation of vehicles.3.     For London and the conurbations, traffic plans, and for Londononly, in the event of an unprecedented stoppage by both British Railwaysand the Underground, a plan to restrict attempts at commuting to thenumber which would be possible without total congestion.4.     Plans for the (last resort) us a of some 8, 000 troops to driverequisitioned lorries for coal or oil.5.     Plans to enlist qualified volunteers to drive tankers (if T&amp;GWUcall out the tanker drivers).6.     Plans to use any possible railway capacity, if it should emerge from a dissident minority, or from managers.    (There are no plans for troops or volunteers to operate railways, which is not now practicalon any significant scale. )7.     Plans by MAFF to monitor the food supply situation.8.     Plans by Post Office to use hired transport for trunk carriage of mail.9.     Plans by DTI to use Emergency Powers immediately to restrictuse of electricity as in February, with priority for essential needs.10.     Plans by DTI to restrict supply of oil from rail-fed terminalsto essential consumers.11.    A DTI-based organisation to monitor effect of fuel shortages.12.    Plans for appropriate publicity (paid and otherwise).13.     DTI plans for use of emergency generators.
14.     Plans for distribution to power stations of up to 50 portableplastic tanks.15. Measures to pay social security benefits to possibly 3 millionunemployed and laid off.29 March 19722
SECRET&quot;ANNEX BDIRECT EFFECTS ON INDUSTRY OF RAIL STRIKE1.   Considaable quantities of coal; oil; iron and steel,scrap metal, iron ore, steel sheet and structural steel; chemicals and fertilizers; for road works; and milk still move by rail.2.   Some of these movements could be made by road but power station supplies, BSC supplies and products, bulk oil supplied to users and to oil company rail fed terminals, and chemicalsother then fertilizers would be interrupted.    The principal effects of the frustration of such rail movement are described below.3.   Coal and oil to -power stations - It is thought that there couldbe no significant substition of road transport because of probableblacking by NUM and TGWU.   .4.   Domestic coal - Depots and stockyards in South Englaad wouldhave to make do with existing stocks.    It might become necessaryto reactivate the domestic coal&apos;priority scheme. Many supplierswould obtain coal by road direct from pitheads.5.   Industrial coal - some supplies   normally     delivered by railwould probably move by road because the NCB would try to keep as many customers supplied as possible   and, in most cases, the NUM.would not be aware of the switch.   However heavy coal users wouldnot receive sufficient to maintain normal activity.    Existing stocks in industry at present average just over two   weeks supply comparedwith nearly four at this time last year.    The main industrial heavyusers of coal are cement, glass, paper, building materials and chemicals.   Industry on the coal fields would be less affected than during a coal strike because the necessary short hauls are normally.moved by road rather than rail.6.   Oil -   20% of oil supplies are moved by rail.    Certain largedirectly supplied industries would have to survive on stocks,averaging two weeks supply.    Stock held at rail fed terminals foronward delivery by road, amount to two weeks normal supplies.    Normalconsumers include priority users notably CEGB, hospitals, foodmanufacturers and public utilities as well as non-priority users.The stocks would last priority users for over four weeks at normalrates of consumption if non-priority users were excluded.    Automotivefuels (Derv and motor spirit; are to some extent supplied through&quot;rail fed terminals but in only a-few areas would more than 50% ofsuch supplies be derived in this way.   Most consumers would be nearbetter supplied regions. /CEGB - Electricity generation could be maintained at normal orrestricted levels, for the periods indicated in the Annex, which takes into account other possible restraints during a rail strikeincluding possible seige by militant pickets frustrating road aswell as rail deliveries.    The estimates are the CEGB&apos;s who have explained that they are on a conservative basis.   Beyond these periodsincreasing difficulty would occur until coal fired generation ceasedand TWILIGHT supplies only were available ,(see E(72)11 and E0(72)(22).BSC by a crash -re-stocking&apos; effort&quot; expect to have 3 v/e&apos;!feks- coal stockson average by the end of March,   This eeuld he stretched&quot; to 6 weeks ormore if only the minimum to Preserve coke ovens were used.    Oil stocks( secret!
1   jcLKhl  Jare only just over a week on average and cannot &quot;be significantlyincreased in the short term.    These stocks would last longer,perhaps up to 3 weeks, when electricity was restricted.    But the combined effect of oil shortage and electricity restriction could-affect steel production and employment before shortage of coal,although it would not create a risk of damage to plant.9.   Foundries   Coke stocks are not yet fully rebuilt but standat one weeks1  supply which would--probably last for two weeks ormore if electricity were also restricted.      There are no stocksof products, nor do customers carry stocks, so car manufacturers and engineering industry would be in difficulty after two weeks.10. &apos; Automobile Manufactu.re     Shortage of components made fromcastings might be the main constraint.      There are .10 days stocks ofsteel sheet whichwould last 20 days with electricity restrictions whichwould, quickly mask other difficulties.      Despatch of finishedvehicles is partly by rail and congestion could be caused if this were interrupted.11.    Construction Industry.    Large supplies of construction steel and reinforcing bars were ordered from abroad during the.coal strike and are still arriving.     The industry now has 6 weeks stocks.   &quot;BSChave no stocks but there are probably some with stock holdingsupplies.12.    Tinolate.    Eight weeks stocks of cans or tinplate are held by workers of cans for food processing.13.    Shipbuilding.    No early lay offs are likely as some three-months stocks of plate is held, though not all specifications areat this level.14.    Wool and other textiles.    Manufactured goods go by road.Raw wool in containers from Australia and South Africa moves by&quot;rail from Tilbury to Suurton, Leeds, but this year1s crop is almost all delivered and there should be no difficulty.    Information isawaited for other textiles but only man-made fibres are thought likely to be affected.15.    Chemicals.    Bulk raw materials to the industry, intermediateproducts within the industry and finished products going to customersmove in special rail tankers.    The industry would be handicappedvery soon after the strike.16.    Control of Oil Supplies. Because of the need to conservesupplies of oil in rail fed terminals for priority users it isproposed to serve Directions under Emergency Regulations on oil companies requiring them not to supply&apos;oil except for scheduledpriority uses.    The schedule of uses is being agreed interdepart-mentally.    Other users normally supplied from terminals would getno new supplies.    They would thus   be in the same position as bulkusers taking supply directly by rail. --^7*   Indirect Effects.    The direct effects mentioned above generallyleave out of account the indirect effect on industry of a rail strikedue to the immediate introduction of electricity restrictions.    Thisby reducing industrial consumption of electricity to roughly half of normal in the case of large and medium size ^establishments wouldmask the interruption of rail borne supplies except for BSC, where-
( SECRET )the shortage of oil   is   more   restrictive   than   theelectricity reduction, chemicals and perhaps car manufacture,The total effect on industry of a rail strike would in most cases not be greater than that of electricity restrictions dueto any other cause.
SECRET )APPENDIXForecast endurance in weeks of CEGB System as at 20 March 1972Endurance is defined for this purpose as the period in average weather conditions during which the CEGB system can continue to produce either(a) full or (b) rationed supplies of electricity to consumers at normalvoltage and frequency.   It v/ould be followed by further periods when therisk of voltage reduction and power cuts at peak periods would increaseday. by day.The endurance of the system   vill &quot;-epend primarily upon the completenessof the rail stoppage,, the militancy and effectiveness of &quot;pickets&quot; and thesympathetic action bj other trades unions and their members.   Three conditions have been carefully considered.   The first condition assumes a state of siegeby pickets similar to the worst days of the miners&apos; strike at power stations and at depots where supplies are despatched to the power stations.   The secondcondition assumes that no coal or heavy fuel oil flows to power stations by either rail or road transport and that other supplies to power stations areonly partially interrupted.   The third condition assumes that rail supplies are badly interrupted and only normal road transport of coal and heavy fuel oil to power stations is maintained and other suppties to power stations arenot seriously affected.Operating      Electricity        * Strike   assumed   to   beginConditions    Demand 31 March 10 April 15 May or thereafterSiege .
