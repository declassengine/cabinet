HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS government cp(72) 27 COPY NO    gg3 March 1972CABINETCIVIL SERVICE NON-INDUSTRIAL manpower memorandum by the Lord Privy seal. It proved impossible to obtain the agreement of my colleagues tothe action needed (CM(71) 41st Conclusions, Minute 2) to reduce the numberof non-industrial civil servants below 500, 000 on 1 April 1972.    AsAnnexes I and II show, the total will then be 503, 000.2. I have approved the 1972-73 Estimates on the basis of the public expenditure Survey Committee (PESC) forecast of a total of 516, 000 on1 April 1973, a net increase of 13, 000 compared with the previous year.Restriction to this total required restraint by Departments for whoseco-operation I am grateful,3. The forecast requirement for 1 April 1974 is 522, 000 - an increaseof 26, 000 since we took office.    Annex III lists the best candidates for transfer out of the Civil Service:  these total 12, 000 but require decision and legislation.    It is thus clear that the carrying forward of theGovernment1 s policies means that we shall not redeem the pledge in our election Manifesto,4. We shall have to meet political criticism as it arises for failure to redeem the pledge.    The new method of presentation (CP(71) 105) helps,but cannot conceal the increases in non-industrial numbers.    these increases will have to be justified, on the lines of the Prime Minister&apos;sreplies to recent Questions (Hansard, 27 January, cols 1610/1612 and3 February, col 196), by explaining that additional staff are needed toprovide better management and more effective services for the community,but that the Government will try to find offsetting reductions by continuing to promote the economical use of manpower.    I do not consider advisablea formal public statement that we have abandoned our pledge,5, Presentation apart, we must keep increases in staff under tautcontrol.    To allow numbers to rise without restriction would not only be politically embarrassing but also a symptom of lack of clear objectives,management drive and the well-ordered administration on which this1
Government prides itself.    The unemployment situation neither exemptsus from maintaining control nor provides us with an excuse for failure.Nothing could be less in line with our strategy than to let people pour intogovernment jobs merely to reduce unemployment.6. Against this background I propose that we should:i. all personally ensure taut control of staff numbers,together witha. special attention to manpower resources in allProgramme Analysis Review studies;b. reliance on the PESC to provide a manpowerframework within which Ministers can plan.    We haveused the PESC forecast for April 1973 as the basis for the1972-73 Estimates and the forecast of 522, 000 for april 1974 (excluding transfers in or out) should providethe planning basis for 1973-74.    In future, I propose toask the Cabinet to take decisions each year on PESCforecasts for the two following years;ii. transfer out of Government by 1 April 1974 those activities which need not remain within it.    I believe the transfer of most ofthose listed in Annex III can be justified on merits;iii. pursue both short and longer term changes which will savemanpower;  for example, those in the taxation field, and the rationalisation of research and developmeit in defence and elsewhere.    I hope too that the Page Committee Report will enablethe Department of National Savings to be removed outsideGovernment;iv. ask each Departmental Minister to commission once inevery five years a management review of his Department, with assistance from outside Government and from my own Department;v. pursue the reorganisation of executive functions to improvemanagement and reduce central government on the lines set out inthe paper (CP(71) 148) circulated by the Prime Minister;vi. restrain severely any staff additions in London and theSouth East other than those already authorised or needed for regional and local purposes;2
vii.      ask Departmental Ministers to seek opportunities to obtainpublicity for any reductions in staff likely to be obtained in thelong run, as a result of reviews of their functions, and to explainpublicly the reasons for increases in their staffs.conclusion. I ask the Cabinet to endorse the policy outlined above.J civil  Service department March 1972
