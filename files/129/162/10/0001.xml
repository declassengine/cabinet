THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 35 COPY NO     6210 March 1972CABINETPOST-APOLLO programme memorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury. I do not think this is a worthwhile project on its own merits,,    Evenif it were a technological success, it would dangerously cramp the optionsfor the future of our civil aerospace industry.2. Take the position by the end of 1974.    We shall have spent well over 500 million on development and production of Concorde without any return from sales.    The civil sides of the airframe and aero engine industries will then be almost entirely dependent on Concorde, the RB 211 and thewings for the European airbus.    If we want to maintain a civil aerospaceindustry thereafter we shall have to choose between finding the money for another subsonic aircraft project, or a stretched Concorde, which wouldbe even more expensive.    This will be a difficult choice in any circumstances.    But if we embark on the expensive post-Apollo projectnow, we may simply not have the resources for either.3. There is in any case no evidence that the health of the guided weapons industry, to which the space section of the industry is more closely related, is in any need of this extra work.    We are currentlyspending about  30 million a year on guided weapons Research andDevelopment (R &amp; D) and new weapons now being studied would amplymaintain the R&amp;D capacity of this part of the industry.M V treasury Chambers10 March 1972
