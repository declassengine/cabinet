HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 47 COPY NO1 May 1972CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1972-73 session memorandum by the Lord President of the council. The Ministerial Committee on Future Legislation have now considered the proposals put forward by Departments for legislation during the 1972-73 Session.    The programme which we recommendis set out in Annex A.2. Each of the legislative programmes we have embarked uponsince taking office has had to be exceptionally heavy.    The Committeeare firmly convinced that our legislative programme for 1972-73 shouldbe significantly lighter.   &quot;We have also borne in mind that if the present session has to be prolonged, we will have less time next Session.3.        In the proposed Main Programme we have nonetheless includedeight major Bills of 50 clauses or more,    Each of these Bills may beexpected to occupy a Standing Committee for a lengthy period and theprogramme can be managed only if we start some of them in the Houseof Lords.    We should try and introduce these Bills as early as possiblein the Session and it is therefore particularly important that the necessarypolicy decisions and drafting instructions are completed in good time.    Theprogramme as a whole is less demanding on Floor time than in recentSessions but is no lighter for the draftsmen,4,        The details of the programme which we recommend are set outin Annex A under the following headings and arranged under Departments -Essential Bills - that is Bills required by a specific date, eg becauseexisting powers expire.Contingent Bills - Bills which may become essential in this sense.Main Programme BillsBills in ReserveBills for Scottish Grand CommitteeBills for Second Reading Committee ProcedureBills suitable for Private Members
Annex B lists the suggested Bills for which we can find no place in theprogramme.5. Essential and Contingent Bills.     The lists include all the Billssuggested by Departments with the exception of Road Traffic, which isin the Main Programme list.6. Main Programme.    This includes the major Bills on training and Employment, Local Government Finance and Miscellaneous Provisions,Water Reorganisation, National Health Service Reorganisation, national insurance and Occupational Pensions, Criminal Evidence, Monopolies,Mergers and Restrictive Practices and Consumer Credit.    In addition there are substantial Bills on Road Traffic and Urban Motorways /LandCompensation.    The Bill on the Third London Airport will also be lengthyif we decide to include provisions establishing a development corporation,and it will almost certainly be hybrid.7. Bills in Reserve.    This includes three substantial Bills which wouldhave good claims to be included in the programme if places could be found;we have not, however, felt able to accommodate them at this stage.8. Second Reading Committee Bills. We have recently managed tosecure the agreement of the Opposition to the use of the Second reading committee procedure for individual Bills before the Bill has been drafted.While, therefore, I am somewhat doubtful whether it will be possible to manage all the Bills listed, I did not wish to rule out any of them at thisstage.9.        In inviting my colleagues to approve this programme I would ask them to bear in mind the need to avoid straining the legislative  capacityof Parliament in the coming Session.    The proposed programme is ratherheavier than the Committee would hzve wished; but most of the Billsincluded, especially the major Bills, have compelling claims and it wouldbe very difficult to find compensating reductions if any further Bills were added to the programme.R.
