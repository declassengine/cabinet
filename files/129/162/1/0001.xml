THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF HER   BRITANNIC  MAJESTVS   GOVERNMENTThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited^It is issued for the personal use top secret copy No.CP(72) 263 March 1972CABINETNORTHERN Ireland memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department. All possible courses of action or inaction are fraught with danger.There are good grounds for arguing that the problem of Northern ireland is insoluble and that a violent confrontation between Loyalist andRepublican is unavoidable.    Sometimes it seems almost as if the peopleof Northern Ireland, or at any rate their political leaders (which inrealistic terms includes the Irish Republic Army (IRA)) are possessed of a death wish.    Yet the time had come when we must choose betweenthe dangers of action and the dangers of inaction,2. I recognise only too well what may be the consequences of any initiative we take.    The two communities are poles apart.    Any proposalsfor a solution must lie somewhere in the ground between them.    Thedanger is that our proposals may be rejected, even with violence, by onecommunity or by both.    It may be suggested that things can hardly be worse than they are.    In fact, they could be.    The potential Protestantbacklash is not a myth.    It is based on the fear and prejudice of many thousands of tough and determined men.    I would not seek to disguisefrom my colleagues the simple fact that any action we take may producegrave consequences.3, The alternative is inaction, or rather pursuing the present courseof meeting IRA violence with force and supporting the reforms so far advanced by Mr Faulkner.    There are strong arguments for doing this.The Army has done well and is making progress.    Any departure fromthe Unionist point of view would appear to be a concession to the Catholics,and therefore inevitably to the IRA unless, of course, they spurn it.    TheProtestants will argue with great vehemence that they have played fairly,that they have proposed sweeping changes and that it is wrong topenalise them for violence that they have not perpetrated.    But the truthis that, right or wrong as they may have been in the recent past or thepast 50 years, Protestants, like Catholics, must have a fundamentalinterest in restoring the chance of peace to their country.126
4. The present position is one of total alienation between the two communities.    Though Mr Faulkner may be right in arguing that manyCatholics do not really want a united Ireland, things have gone beyond that stage,    I do not believe there is any possibility of persuading Catholicsto go back to the old system.5. The Army&apos;s progress has been considerable, particularly in belfast, but the facts are that:i. The situation outside Belfast and iu Londonderry is still very serious.ii. The condition of today&apos;s success is half the Army in Ulsterand a growing number of internees.iii. In the nature of modern urtan society you cannot entirelyeliminate the bombings and the shootings however effective Armyaction may be.iv. Political alienation between the two communities is nowcomplete.v. Any temporary lull caused by the pressure of the Armyon the IRA would not last long.vi. Our whole position in the world is being seriously affectedby Northern Ireland, and however hard we try we will not getother countries to understand the reality of the situation,6. I have myself, therefore, come to the conclusion that the dangers of continuing with the present policy are now greater than the dangers of trying to make a new start.    I believe that if we make such an attempt andfail to get agreement we shall at least in the long term draw the benefit for having proposed a solution that is just and equitable between the differing factions.    We should not underestimate the importance of this.OUTLINE OF INITIATIVE7. Clearly our purpose must be to produce proposals which are fair and rational, and at the same time offer as much as possible to each side.The key seems to me to lie in what Protestants and Catholics really caremost about.    The Protestants care most about the Border and the continuing position of Northern Ireland as part of the United Kingdom.The Catholics care most about ending the situation in which for decadesnow they have without doubt been treated as second-class citizens.    Whilefew Catholics outside the IRA really believe in a united Ireland achieved by force, even fewer I suspect would be prepared to agree now to aprolongation of total Unionist domination and to a system which does not give them either a guarantee of non-discrimination or a proper share inthe government of their country.. 2
8. I believe that our first purpose is to give further guarantees to theProtestants about the integrity of Northern Ireland.    The idea ofrepartitioning is often canvassed and is in many ways attractive, but it isvery unlikely to work in practice and it runs against the fundamentaldifficulty of the pledge in the 1949 Act that the Border will not be alteredwithout the consent of the Parliament of Northern Ireland.    There is, inconstitutional terms, little more that can be done to safeguard their position, as no Parliament can bind its successor, but within this limitI believe a lot can be done if we propose, and in this proposal obtain thesupport of the Opposition, that any such vote in the Northern ireland parliament must be preceded by a plebiscite.    Such a plebiscite shouldbe held in the near future.    After that there should not be another for aperiod of 15 or 20 years.    Without such a period we cannot contribute tostability cn the constitutional issue and unless there is stability over aperiod of years there is little chance of the rival factions agreeing to makea go of Northern Ireland itself as part of ft:n United Kingdom.9. The Unionists are on strong ground when they refuse to be excludedfrom the United Kingdom against -their will.    But I think they try and have it both ways by demanding the right to remain in the United Kingdom and toremain on their own terms, ie. on a basis of regional autonomy far greaterthan that accorded to any other region of the United Kingdom.    I think weare entitled to say to them &quot;we support you to the hilt in your desire toremain in the United Kingdom, but if you do so you must conform as closely as possible to the pattern of the United Kingdom and above all you must accept, as much as anyone else, the ultimate authority of the United KingdomGovernment and the United Kingdom Parliament&quot;.    (They would, on this basis., be entitled to a substantially increased representation at westminster and mis I think it would be only fair &apos;.o accord them).3.0.       This argument leads me to the question of responsibility for lawand order.    Mr Faulkner guards this jealously.    He thinks that without this power the Northern Ireland Government would be demoted to the status of a county council.    This is a bad argument.    Neither Scotland nor wales have a Government or Parliament of their own responsible for law andorder, and even without this responsibility Stormont would have economicand social responsibilities far beyond those of any county council (manycounties have a greater population than Northern Ireland).    I have come tothe conclusion that it is right to transfer the responsibility for law andorder from Stormont to Westminster for the following reasons:i. At present, and for years to come, the maintenance oflaw and order will be the responsibility of the Army, which isanswerable to the Westminster Government,    It does not seemrational in those circumstances for responsibility for law andorder to rest with the Northern Ireland Government, who haveno control over the main instrument for maintaining it.3
ii. I do not believe there is any chance now of getting the minority community, or incidentally the Opposition at &quot;Westminster,to accept that the administration of law and order by Stormont asat present constituted will be impartial.iii. The recent conduct of the Northern Ireland Governmentleads one to doubt whether an essentially provincial organisation has the resources to handle efficiently matters of this size and complexity.11.        I would therefore propose that the power to legislate on matters relating to law and order should be transferred to Westminster, and thatin this emergency cituation control over the Royal Ulster Constabulary(RUC), in its role of preserving order, should rest with the Army, though this should not mean in practice any change in the way things work.Decisions on internment, the management jf piisons and other ancilliaryactivities, including prosecutions, would have to be transferred to ministers responsible to the Westminster Parliament.    The long term aimwould be to have the same system operating in Northern Ireland as in therest of the United Kingdom, with a Chief Constable in charge answerableprimarily to the local body, which in this case would be Stormont, but with over-riding powers in the hands of the Home Secretary and hisInspectorate.    We 3hould seek to integrate the R.UC with the police forcesof the United Kingdom as a whole.12.       I recognise that Mr Faulkner will object vehemently to this andherein lieu great danger.    But I do not think his objections will be well-founded, nor do I believe they will be in the interests of the future peace and good government of Northern Ireland as an incegral part of theUnited Kingdom.13.        The next decision must be how we provide a proper place for the minority community in the public life of Northern Ireland.    There are twoelements here:i. The avoidance of discrimination between individuals.ii. Ending the exclusion of minority representatives fromthe direction of public affairs.14.        The reform programme has done a lot to eliminate discriminationfrom the public life of the Province.    Of what remains, the most seriousis job discrimination, which is virtually beyond the power of government.I do not think much more needs doing in this field, but the idea of a bill of Rights is an interesting one and could well be of value,15.        Providing the minority representatives with their proper share inthe life and public affairs of the Province is a far more intransigentproblem.    The majority has its rights as well as the minority.    Thenormal Westminster system will continue for many years to come to provide4
automatic Unionist majorities,    If we are to ensure minority participationwe must therefore depart from our accepted systems.    The problem Ithink falls into three categories - administration;  legislature;  government:i. Much progress has been made in ensuring proper minorityrepresentation in administrative bodies concerned, eg. with housing or the police.    This process needs to be completed.ii. Changes in the legislature could be on the lines proposedby Mr Faulkner,    A revised Senate, a larger House based onproportional representation, special Committees and so forth.This will appeal to men of goodwill and certainly will represent an advance, but undeniably the Prote stants will continue to havea majority in Stormont, and indeed it is unavoidable in anydemocratic basis of election.iii. The problem of minority representation in government is far the most difficult and will be most strongly opposed byMr Faulkner.    His public position, the only one that can be publiclyargued, is that you cannot include in one Cabinet men working to preserve the Union and men working to destroy it.    He has qualifiedthis argument by saying he does not object to people who ultimatelybelieve in a united Ireland so long as they are not actively working for it,    A lot of the problem springs from personal animosities.The basic fact is that no Catholics in the Cabinet will command theconfidence of the minority community unless they are chosen bythem and it is difficult to think of any method of choice other thanthe ballot box.    In other countries there are examples of differentcommunities sharing the powers of government and I do not see why it should not be possible in Northern Ireland given some will tomake such a system work.    I believe the best chance we have of creating such a will lies in putting the problem of the Border intocold storage for 15 or 20 years by the referendum system I have described.    There are several ways of providing for minorityrepresentation in the Cabinet, of which the most promising, orleast unpromising, seems to be representation proportionate to a party&apos;s membership in Stormont, subject to a minimum number ofMembers.    All this would be for discussion as part of the businessof hammering out the new Constitution.    Difficult as it no doubtseems and will be described by the critics, the simple fact is thereare only three alternatives - a Cabinet with minority representationchosen by the minority;  a Cabinet that continues to be totallydominated by Unionists, which I believe is no longer acceptable tothe minority;  or no Cabinet at all.16.       An immense amount of work is involved in these proposals -legislation to provide for the periodical plebiscites and for the transfer ofthe law and order functions to Westminster;  extensive discussions on the shape of the new Government and administration, and the legislation requiredto implement it;  the holding of the first plebiscite and of the first elections5
based on the new system.    All this will take some time, possibly up to two years.    The question is, who should govern in the meantime?    Thereseem to be strong arguments for appointing a Secretary of State to carryout the legislative and administrative functions of Stormont.    In the formerhe would be assisted by an Advisory Council drawn from distinguishedpeople of both communities, but preferably not including politicians.    Thelatter task, administration, he would conduct through the permanentCivil Service, who, it seems reaoonable to anticipate, will be preparedto co-operate with this new system.    The arguments for introducing what could be called Commission Government under a Secretary of State are:i. That there is a lot to be said for a clean ^reak with theold system and an interim period of government while the new system is being worked out and implemented.ii. Distrust of Mr Faulkner is so widespread, not only inthe minority community, that it is difficult to see how thenecessary consultations and agreement could be achieved whilehis Government remained in power.iii. Mr Faulkner himself has openly said that he would not carry on if law and order were transferred from Stormont to westminster.17.       It is difficult to assess with any confidence reactions to theestablishment of such a Commission.    I think it would be well receivedoutside Northern Ireland and by a substantial body of sensible opinioninside Northern Ireland.    Clearly it will not satisfy the extremists on either side, and the Protestants will argue that ii. is a concession to their , though all the evidence we have suggests that they would not forciblyoppose it, particularly if it could be seen that the purpose of the whole scheme is to give further safeguards to those who do not wish to see a united Ireland.18.        The Secretary of State would take over the functions of Stormont,but I hope myself it would be possible to arrange that Stormont be notdissolved, but in fact prorogued.    The continuing existence of Stormont,even deprived for a temporary period of its powers, would be a furtherconsolation to the Protestants and I am examining the possibility ofproviding that in addition to the plebescite, the power under the 1949 Actto place a veto on Border changes should not be transferred to theSecretary of State but should remain with Stormont.19.       We must at the same time decide what to do about internment.    I donot believe it is possible to release all internees or to bring all of them totrial.    The fundamental principle of a trial is that the accused should beable to confront his accusers and this condition does not exist in NorthernIreland.    The present Advisory Committee is soon due to retire and this might be an occasion for revising some of the details of their procedure6
and giving them a judicial appearance.    Under my proposals responsibilityfor internment would be transferred to the Secretary of State and he willhave complete discretion to release any individual.    Now that the internees have been segregated into categories it should be possible tomake an early release of some in the lowest security category and to makeit clear that the intention is progressively to release internees as and if their  campaign subsides and constitutional progress is made.    In themeantime, however, I am sure it would be very bad for Army morale if either we agreed to release hard core internees, or prevented the Armyfrom making further arrests among hard core members of either the officials or the Provisionals.20.       To sum up, my recommendations would be as follows:j. The time has ccme to take the initiative.    Though this wouldbe attended by great dangers, the ^angers of not doing so are noweven greater.ii. Our basic principle should be that so long as NorthernIreland by a majority wishes to remain in the United Kingdom thiswill be respected, but it must be on the understanding that they accept the over-riding authority of the United Kingdom Governmentand Parliament, as do all other parts of the United Kingdom.iii. Responsibility for law and order should be transferred from Stormont to Westminster.iv. The protection of Protestants against a united ireland should be buttressed by the device of periodic plebiscites.v. Proper provision must be made,, after consultation, for the participation of the minority community in the life and public affairs of the Province by adapting administration, legislature and government.vi. In the interim period, while the necessary adjustments arebeing made, the discussions held and the legislation enacted,the powers of Stormont should be temporarily transferred to a secretary of State.vii. We should make such changes as we can in the internmentsystem, beginning by releasing some of the least dangerousinternees and making it clear that our purpose is the total end of internment when security considerations and the state of public order enable us to do this,R m home Office2 March 19727
