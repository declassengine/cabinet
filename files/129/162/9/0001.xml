DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 34 COPY NO   g  10 March 1972CABINETTHE POST-APOLLO PROGRAMME AND UNITED KINGDOMSPACE AND AEROSPACE ACTIVITIESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and industry. Current space activities of the United Kingdom consist of a numberof sepaiate programmes directed towards different ends and managed by different Departments.    We also collaborate in certain internationalprogrammes,,    Annex A shows current activities,, their broad objectives and the Departments responsible,,    Annex B shows recent expenditure by departments on these activities.2, The annexes show that &quot;apace policy&quot; is little more, at present,than an aggregate of those parts of other policies which happen to takeplace in space; that this does not amount to a coherent policy, nor does it providea very satisfactory basis for the National Space Technology Programme forwhich I am responsible.    This programme is supposed to maintain an appropriate United Kingdom space capability and should ideally anticipate the space policy requirements of customer Departments.    Organisational &apos;changes will be needed and proposals will be put to colleagues shortly,,3, The post-Apollo programme, in which participation has been invited by the United States authorities, will introduce a range of new techniques with an increasing bearing on all these activities.    It will involve the development of reusable elements permitting greaterreliability and flexibility than is possible at present.    The cost of space projects is expected to be reduced by a factor of at least six,4. User Departments&apos; assessment of the&quot; opportunities likely tobe offered by the new techniques of the post-Apollo programme must clearly hinge on the maximum possible information about it.    The costreductions forecast are likely to have strong customer appeal quite apartfrom the improved reliability which the new techniques should facilitate.If a customer requires a &quot;space solution&quot; in the future he will increasinglyneed to evaluate it against the post-Apollo framework,5,        The benefits to be derived from participation in the development programme itself would depend on the nature of the work done and the size of the United Kingdom contribution but they include:1
i. The techniques used in the orbiter will also be of value for future aircraft development,ii0        Work on the space tug autopilot and rendezvous and dockingcapabilities are of special interest for future satellite development,iii. Participation by United Kingdom industry in this majoraerospace project of the next 10 years would ensure that designteams were kept competitive, which has a bearing on our capabilityin the guided weapons (GW) field,iv. Partnership in the development programme would enable aright to use the system to be negotiated. No customer policy has yet been formulated by the United States,v. Participation in co-operation with the other european countries would help to develop a coherent European spaceprogramme.    If we stand aside we should run the risk of being left out of a technological field which reads across into other areas.We must bear in mind particularly the impact of our decision on theprospects for European collaboration in the aerospace field generally.6. For participation in the further studies it can be said, therefore:i. They are part of the normal phased approach which would help to decide whether participation in the development programme is in United Kingdom interests.ii. British firms would play a leading part in advancedtechnological studies which would enhance their reputation andtechnical capability,iii. They relate to design for space vehicles of the 1980s whichwould be useful for any future work,iv. British industry will be given the leading role as primecontractors in these studies if we participate;  equally it has beenmade clear by the European Launcher Development organisation that this valuable work will be placed elsewhere if we do not,7, Against the background of the aerospace industry as a wholeemploying some 220, 000 people the space section is a small part.    It ismore closely related to guided weapons than aircraft and employs about1, 000 qualified engineers and scientists in three firms (the British aircraft corporation, Hawker Siddeley Dynamics and Marconi).    The work load is declining and some concentration of capacity is desirable    Discussions are going on between major firms in the aerospace industry about their futurerelationships which may produce some rationalisation in the GW/space field.Participation in the post-Apollo programme could help to produce this ifit were decided to back one firm.    The technological and managerialcontent of the work is likely to be high.2
8. Future strategy for the aerospace industry as a whole is underreview by the Marshall Committee and I hope to inform my colleaguesshortly of the outcome of that review.    I do not propose to anticipate the outcome in this paper.    But I remind my colleagues that our interest inthe aerospace field generally may well prove to lie in closes? Europeancollaboration and that our decision on post-Apollo needs to be seen against that background,,J d department of Trade and Industry10 March 1972
