THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government cp(72) 48 COPY NO 9^9 May 1972CABINETPROGRAMME OF LEGISLATIVE BUSINESS 1971-72Memorandum by the Lord President of the council. In the period 15 May to 4 August there will be, on the basis of aweek&apos;s break at Whitsun, 55 sitting days.    Annexed is a statement showing the claims on this time.2. There are time limits attaching to a number of items arisingeither through Standing Orders, statutory requirements or compellingadministrative reasons:-(i)     Supply must be completed by 4 August at the latest; itmay be required before then.(ii)     By statute the Finance Bill is also required by 4 August,but VAT considerations make Royal Assent pretty well essentialby the first week in July.(iii) The Housing Finance and Housing (Financial Provisions)(Scotland) Bills are required by early or mid-July.    In both cases this aim could be frustrated if the Bills are amended inthe Lords.(iv) If the Local Government Bill is not obtained by the end ofSeptember there would be serious consequential disadvantages.Here, again, Lords Amendments would complicate the timetable.(v)     A strong case has been made for Royal Assent to theNational Insurance Bill before the Summer Adjournment.3. The foregoing considerations influence the programme for theEuropean Communities Bill.    The Chief Whip and I consider that whiledoing everything possible to get Bills to the Lords quickly, probably thefirst consideration should be to get the European Bill out of the Commonsno later than mid-July - bearing in mind that more than 2 days a week on it might be too onerous both for Ministers and Members;  and we would
also obviate the risks entailed in 3 days a week and the further delay tothe Local Government Bill.    With this in mind we have tentativelyarranged for the remaining 11 Committee days on the Bill to be taken on 23 and 24 May, 7, 8, 13, 14, 20, 21, 27 and 28 June and 10 July(the interval in the week beginning 3 July is necessary for the Report and third Reading of the Finance Bill).4.        A programme on these lines should allow the Housing (financial provisions) (Scotland) Bill to reach the Lords on 6 June and the LocalGovernment Bill on 3 July.    In addition we hope that the Criminal justice bill can reach them on 22 May.5. The programme is subject to change at any time because wecannot be sure when business such as Rhodesia, Northern Ireland,industrial disputes, will need to be accommodated.6. Finally, it is perhaps worth remarking that satisfactory progress is contingent on exploiting Government Fridays fully.R CPrivy Council Office9 May 1972V2
