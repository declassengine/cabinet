IISDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C(69) 150 COPY NO. ^jJ^L26th November, 1969CABINETNIGERIA; RELIEFMemorandum, by fche Secretary of State for Foreign andC commonwealth Affair a relief for BiafraThroughout the war the Federal Government have been prepared toagree to the provision of relief supplies for the civilian population ofBiafra with suitable safeguards for both sides,,    They have at various times offered to accept land and r*ver routes.    The Biafrans have alsospoken in favour of surface routes,, but they have sought to insist that suchroutes should, be by river (to avoid the appearance of the relief suppliescoming to them across Nigerian soil) and in areas which for military purposes they would wish to have neutralised,,    They have also insisted onthird party guarantees0    It has not been possible in these circumstances for agreement on any specific route to be reached,,    The United StatesGovernment recently worked out detailed proposals for the supply of reliefup the Cross River and secured fche agreement of both ssdes in principle tothisa    However, the proposal quickly ran into guarantee and inspectionsdifficulties and although the Biafrans have recently reiterated their acceptance of the route and fche Americans have offered to resume negotiations on it* the Americans have also made it clear that it eouXd notbe used on a large scale in the near future because of low water levels.It cannot therefore be any substitute for daylight relief flights by which alone (failing agreement on a land corridor) substantial volumes of reliefcould be carried,,20      Until June this years the Federal Government reluctantly toleratedfche night airlift of relief supplies into Biafra from outside Nigeria by theinternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and Joint Church Aid(JCA),    However, they made it elaar that those flights were objectionableto them since they took place at nighty thus providing cover for theBiairan arms  lights,, and that the Federal Government would prefer to seerelief flights taking place by day with suitable arrangements for inspection and control,.    On 5fch June fche Federal Air Force shot down a SwedishP.ed Cross aircraft flying a,t last light (the Federal Government later-1-
described this as a &quot;disaster&quot; and a case of &quot;mJUifcaken identity&quot;),,    TheJ.CRC suspended its airlift a few days later? and apart from one or twoflights agreed for specific purposes with both sidesj, has not resumed since,,The JCA airlift was also suspendeds but was resumed on a smaller scalea few weeks later and is now delivering abouS X8 000 tons a week    (the published figures are somewhat smaller; the figure of ij, 000 tons is derivedfrom secret sources),,    The relief organisations calculate that this amountneeds to be doubled or trebled if the supplies provided are to be adequate.An ICRC estimate earlier this year reckoned that the civilian population inBiafra needed between 300 and 500 tons a night if starvation on a large scale was to be averfcedc    At the height of the JCA and ICRC airlifts ir.the spring of this year,,., nightly deliveries averaged between 200 and 300 tons,,3,      At the end of June the Federal Government announced detailed proposals for a daylight airlifts including provision for inspection ofsupplies on Federal soiJU    They also offered to allow internationalobservers to supervise the inspection procedures and other aspects of theairlift,,    Relations between the Federal Government and the ICRC were extremely poor at this time,, and British Ministers were largely instrumentalin persuading the Federal Government and the ICRC to resume discussions of the arrangements for a resumed airlift, which led to a visit to Lagos bythe President of the ICRC,,    He announced at the end of his talks that theICRC would not fly over Nigerian territory except with the permission ofthe Federal Government,,40      Prolonged negotiations between the ICRC and both sides followed in geneva^ and on 14fch August the Biafran delegation formally accepted theICRCs proposals,, subject to the understanding of the Biafran regime that&quot;its acceptance of the foregoing proposals is without prejudice to thecontinued use of Uli airport for its own operations&quot;0    After a month offurther negotiations with the Federal Government^, very similar (but notidentical) arrangements for daylight flights were embodied in a formal agreement between the Federal Government and the ICRC signed in Lagosoh 13th September^    The agreement contained a clause by which it wag to be&quot;without prejudice to military operations by the Federal military government&quot; - the Federal Governments quid pro quo for the Biafranstipulation on the continued use of Uli airport for its own operations.However,, the following day (l4fch September) the Biafrans announced theirrejection of the Federal Governments agreement with the ICRC on  hegrounds that the Federal Governments stipulation threatened Biafransecurity,,    The Biafrans demanded international third party guaranteesagainst Nigerian military exploitation of the flights.,5.      Under the arrangements embodied in the ICRCs agreement with thetwo sides0 an unlimited number of flights would be permitted duringspecified daylight hours0    Aircraft would leave from points outsideNigerian territory^, with provision for impartial inspection at the departurepoint.    The Federal Government would have She right to call down selectedv. aircraft for supplementary inspection at Lagos (the Biafrans made ii clear
that any such aircraft^ ,lf they had landed at Lagos8 would be turned back from Uli without being allowed to land),.    Both the ICRC and JCA havemade it clear that they would much prefer daylight to night flightos both onthe grounds of the safety of their crews and aircraft and also because,daylight flights would permit greater quantities to be flown in,,60      The ICRC have persisted in their attempts to secure Biafranacceptance of the Federal Governments agreement of .13th September,but despite a special high level mission to Biafra for talks with Ojukwufrom 15th to 21st October,, they have not so far been able to persuade theBiafrans to drop or modify their demand for intei&apos;nafcional guai*guarantees of a kind which no Government is likely to contemplate,    (We know from secretsources that in fact the Blafrans* main concern is to secure an AmericanGovernment guarantee which would involve the United States more closely in the war and confer some degree of recognition).    Late in October,, theUnited States Government songM and obtained from the federal government a &quot;solemn assurance&quot; that it would ensure that no hostilemilitary action would be taken against the ICRC relief aircraft used fordaylight relief flightu    At the same times, the Americans secured offersfrom other governments of impartial observei&apos;3 to accompany the ICRCaircraft,,    The Federal Governmenfs assurance and the offer of impartialobservers were conveyed by Ambassador Clyde Ferguson to the 3iaf rans0Ambassador Ferguson also offered the Biafrans a statement by theUnited States Government of its confidence in the good faith of the federal government, together with a public indication that the United StatesGovernment associated itself with the agreement of 13th September,,    (Thelatter offers have never been publicly revealed).    The Biafrans rejected allthese offers on 24th October, mainly on the grounds that the assurances given offered no protection for Ull airport.    On 12fch Novembers, theAmerican Secretary of Statep Mr0 Rogers,, issued a statement describingsome of the stepc taken by the American Government and summing thesituation up in the following words;&quot;Daylight flights under agreed procedures therefore remain Iheonly practical scheme for an immediate and substantial expansionof relief operations,.    We believe that the ICRC proposal is sucha realistic and. reasonable scheme.    We consider that the federal government, in agreeing to the ICRC proposal,, has actedconstructively and in accordance with its humanitarianresponsibilities,.    We also believe that the proposed arrangements for daylight flights meet in a reasonable mannerthe legitimate security concerns of the Biafran authorities c 0.We earnestly hope that the Biafran leadership will consider its position regarding daylight flights&quot;.7a      We have pood reason fco believe tbjtfc fchw Blafraas ft re not Iw. fncfcprepared to accept daylight flights on any terms.    This Is clearly becausethey are unwilling to give up the cover for their arms  lights which theexisting night airlift providesj becatise they do not wish to accept reHef
under arrangements which might seem to make them beholden to theFederal Government (sioctt this would refute their own propagandaaccording to which the Federal Government is deliberately seeking tostarve the Ibo people to death)? and because the use of Uli for daylightrelief flights would psavent their own military aircraftj, which have nonight-time capability., from operating at alL    They have accordingly made their acceptance of daylight flights publicly conditional on what amounts tothe complete security from attack,, under international guarantees, of Uliairport^ which is the primary military target of the Federal forces0    Inthese circumstances^, the prospects of agreement on an airlift in circumstances short of an end to the fighting appear remote8*      The IGRG are considering the possibility of airdrops of relief supplies into Biafra thus avoiding the difficulties over the use of Ulic    Atthe suggestion of the British High Commission in Lagos, a note on thelogistics of airdrops has been prepared by the Ministry of Defence in a formsuitable for transmission on an informal basis to the ICRC3 and copies havebeen despatched to Lagos and Geneva for this purpose    The ICRC have carried out certain experiments and believe that airdrops would be feasible,, although according to our own calculations thev would beextreatfdy costly in terms of the tonnages which could be delivered,,Moreover^ although the problems over the use of Uli would be avoided,,many of the same difficulties would arise as in the case of the proposalsfor a daylight airlift (including the problem of inspection and points of departure o90      Meanwhile^ part of the ICRC^s relief stocks held at Cotonou(Dahomey) and Fernando Po have been transferred to the French Red Crossor the Church organisations for the night airliftc    The ICRC claims thatthey have left it to the original donors of the supplies to decide whetherthey should be transferred and if so to whom.    The ICRC is continuingits relief activities in Biafra on a redticed scales with the help of theChurch organisations 0Relief in the Federal areas10o      With the virtual collapse of relations between the ICRC and theFederal Government in Juner the Federal Government decided to transfer the responsibility for co-ordinating relief in the Federal areas from theICRC to the Nigerian Rehabilitation Commission and the Nigerian red cross,,    The ICRC accepted this decision and co-operated in implementingit0    However, the transfer has been accompanied by considerable confusion and there is no doubt that the handover resulted, in October,, in a steeprise in the numbers of civilian victims of the war who died as a result ofnot receiving relief food and drugs which were previously supplied by theICRC organisation.,    The worst of the defects of October have now been?&quot;emedieds and fhe numbers receiving relief in the Federal areas are nowroughly equivalent to those before the transfer (nearly one million)eNeither the Nigerian Rehabilitation Commission nor the Nigerian Red Cross&quot;4-
is likely to be able to raise money throughout the world on anything like as large a scale as the ICRC was able to do (especially as the ICRC wasraising money for use on both sides, and was thus able to take financialadvantage of the widespread sympathy for the Biafrans),    It has not yetbeen decided how much the Federal Government will contribute towards the costs of the Rehabilitation Commission and Nigerian Red Cross, nor howresponsibility will be distributed between the two organisations0    TheLeague of International Red Cross Societies is at present studying thesituation and expects to make recommendations on how the relief operations should be organised and financed,,The British Government^ Contributions110       Her Majestyts Government have so far spent or offered just over 2 million for relief in the Federal areas and in Biafra,    Colonel Ojukwuhas repeatedly made it clear that he is not prepared to accept relief fromthe British Government as long as we are supplying arms to the federal government,    It has not therefore been possible to give direct reliefassistance to BiafraB but we have been able to get round this bycontributing  950,000 to the ICRC    No stipulation has been made as to how or on which side this money should be spents it has gone into thegeneral pool of ICRC resources, and has therefore been available for financing relief in Biafra as well as on the Federal side,12,      In addition to the  950, 000 given as a cash grant to the ICRC,Her Majesty*s Government have had their own bilateral relief programme which has amounted so far to  520, 000,    Most of this has been devoted tounderwriting the costs of the British Save the Children Fund socio-medicalteams in the Federal areas? hire charges for rivercraft in the relief areas;the purchase of vehicles, food and medical supplies and the cost ofmaintaining a vehicle mechanics team.    We are at present processingvarious requests from the Rehabilitation Commission and the NigerianRed Cross for assistance from the unspent balance of this allocation.Finally, we have offered food grains under the Rome Food Aid convention to a value of  0* 5 million, together with a grant of up to  100, 000 for the associated freight and insurance costs of the food, although no decision hasbeen taken so far on how or when this offer should be taken up0    progress on this has been delayed by the transfer of responsibilities from the ICRCto the Rehabilitation Commission, but discussions are now going on in Lagosas to the kinds of food that would be acceptable.    Under the Convention, thegift must be made to a Government, and fche food will therefore have to bemade available for the Federal side only.Foreign and Commonwealth Office, S,W,1,26th Novembera 1969
