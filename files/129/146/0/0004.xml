draft of white paperpolicy for productivity,  prices and incomes after I969a.     in.tr o due t i on1.      in 1965 government,  employers and trade unions in thiscountry made history by signing a declaration of intent whichembodied a new approach to the problems of britain&apos;s economic development.    for years the growth of our economy had vacillatedbetween &quot;stop&quot;  and &quot;go&quot;  and the challenge was to find ways of enabling governments to pursue a policy of steady and sustainedgrowth,    this,   the signatories agreed, would only be possible ifways could be found of breaking the hitherto automatic link between expansion and inflation which had led to balance of paymentscrises and had forced governments to    check; . growth.    it was from this belief that the productivity,  prices and incomes policy was born.2.      since that time the policy has played an important part inthe government1s two-pronged strategy of correcting the gravedeficits in our balance of payments while laying the foundations of sustained long-term growth.    during this period the operationof the policy has taken different forms as the nature of theeconomic challenge  facing us has  changed and,   inevitably,  heavystrains have been put on it as priority has had to be given toresolving the immediate short-term problems of our overseasdeficits.3.      but the principles which inspired the policy remain as validas they ever were.     indeed, britain is not alone in strugglingto find ways of stimulating expansion without over-stimulatingdemand and so inflating costs.    it is a problem which increasinglyplagues all industrial economies, whether capitalist,  communistor socialist and other countries are seeking a solution asearnestly as britain is.    but for this country,  with its specialdependence on international trade,   the need to find a solution is imperative.    the government believes that a productivity,prices and incomes policy must continue to play a key role in anyexpansionist and socially just economic strategy for britain./it believes
A/2It believes,  too,  that despite the difficulties experienced in recent stages of the policy,  neither employers nor unions would wish to return to an irresponsible  free  for all,   either in price fixing or in wage bargaining-4c      The purpose of this White Paper is to describe the frame-work within which the Government believes the policy should develop.    Improvements in our economic position have made it possible to remove the more stringent controls of the 19-67 and1968 Prices and Incomes Act.    But until our economic recoveryis more firmly established premature relaxation of our guardwould be foolish.5.      That is why the Government has decided to re-activateits powers under Part II of the 1966 Act.    But the white paper also provides the basis on which a permanent policy,built on the voluntary acceptance of its aims as visualised inthe Declaration of 1965,   can be developed in tne years ahead.
B.    Review of the Operation of the policy.      Any productivity,  prices and incomes policy depends for its success on changing people&apos;s attitudeso    The architects of thepolicy in 1965 saw it as an evolutionary process which couldonly yield results over a considerable period of time.    But for britain in 1965 time for slow change was not available-    In thedeliberately stimulated consumer boom period up to October 1964.everyone had been encouraged to take rising living standards for granted regardless as to whether they had been earned by higher productivity and exports and it proved impossible for theGovernment to bring home to them urgently enough the fact that itwas this artificial boom which had precipitated in 1964. the highestoverseas deficit /since the war/ /in our historv7.    In 1965 andthe first part of 1966 wage rates continued to increase at about7s% a year while productivity was only rising by about \\% a year.The country&apos;s reserves of foreign currency were falling rapidly.In such a situation the Government was forced to take drasticshort-term measures,  including direct action on incomes throughthe wages and prices   &apos;freeze1.    But a  &quot;freeze&apos;  can only be ashort-term emergency policy and in July 1967 it had to be relaxed.The result was another upward spurt in earnings which betweenJune 1967 and March 1968 rose at an annual rate of 9%-    export prices rose by an annual rate of 8%.    Once again the country&apos;s foreign currency reserves began to fall,   so  seriously thatdevaluation became inevitable.2.      Devaluation had two results:    first,  it offered a greatopportunity to effect a fundamental and lasting improvement inour competitive position,  provided that our competitiveness wasnot once again eroded by rising costs;  and secondly,  it increased the cost of our imports and led inevitably to an increase inprices generally.    As the Prices and Incomes Board put it inits 3rd Annual Report:   &apos;We are thus faced with the paradoxicalposition that the act of devaluation makes a prices and incomes policy more necessary than before while also making its executionmore difficult&apos;.    Once again it became necessary to give an urgentshort-term role to prices and incomes policy.    The stringent/powers
B/2powers of the 1968 Act over both prices and pay were needed to  drive home the fact that Britain simply could not afford to throw away the advantages of devaluation by allowing avicious price/wage price spiral to force up unit costs.    In this the policy was remarkably successful as the following table shows:Increases  (at annual rates)Period(1) April 1965-June 1966(2)  July 1966-June 1967(3)  July 1967-March 1968(4)  April 1968-December 1968(5)  January I969-September 1969HourlyWageRates2o89.24.3Earnings(seasonallyadjusted7.61.78.87.96.6-   ,   ., Wages,  SalariesRetail -2-2-----rr :-        per unit ofPrices        r 15.12.52.85.5output7.00.34.31.95.1        /not available/&apos;3.      In 1968-69 pay agreements were,  by and large,  kept withinthe guidelines of the 1968 policy.    The index of wage rates afterMarch 1968 rose more than the 3-%% ceiling,  but this was mainly due to productivity agreements involving larger increases whichwere permissable under the policy.    In 1968 earnings rose muchfaster,  but then so did productivity.    One of the main aims ofthe policy during this period was to stimulate a new approach toproductivity bargaining and its success in doing this undoubtedlycontributed to the exceptional increase in productivity which took place in 1968 and which held down unit costs.    At the sametime industry co-operated willingly over prices policy,  and theGovernment maintained a vigilant examination of major priceincreaseso    As a result of all these things prices in 1968 roseonly moderately over and above the increase which flowedinevitably from the effect of devaluation on import prices andthe increases in taxation needed to make devaluation work.    In aperiod,  therefore, when rising prices and expanding industrial/activity
B/3activity might well have led to an uncontrollable spiral of pay and price increases,  the rise in unit costs between March and december 1968 was  successfully contained to an annual rate of1.9%k.      It is too  early to say what the rise in unit costs will bein 1969 but from the third quarter of 19o9j  pay settlements haveonce again begun to burst through the restraints of the policy.Settlements reached in September 1969 averaged over 6%;  inOctober they averaged about 8- %;   largely due to the determination of those in the public services to catch up with increases in earnings which had been achieved in private industry where localpay settlements,  not always consistent with the policy,  had inflatedearnings.    It is against this background that  Cuture developments of the policy mist be reviewed.5o      The lesson of the past few years is that the use of aproductivity,  prices and incomes policy for short-term purposescan only have a short-term effect.    The role of the policy is essentially an educational one:     designed to bring home the factthat continuing steady expansion of the economy depends on ourstriking the right balance between an immediate increase in consumption and the long-term needs of economic development.    in doing so,  it widens the area of democractic choice;  on the one hand we can choose to plan the rise in incomes  so that it does notendangerexports and the investment on which productivity,  highreal earnings and a high level of employment depend.    On theother,  we can claim the right to extort whatever increases in incomes we can individually get regardless of the consequencesand thus force  governments to control excess demand by slowing down the economy once again.    In moving towards the long-term development of the policy the Government will be placing morereliance on its  educational role but the need to learn the lessons of economic choice is as urgent as ever it was.
C&quot;    The Aims of the policy.      From the beginning,   the policy has tried to give thecommunity an opportunity of achieving three aims:-(i)     to keep prices more  stable than in the past;(ii)    to achieve faster growth in the real standard ofliving;(iii)    to get a more rational and fair relationship betweenthe incomes of various groups,  and in particular toimprove the position of low paid workers.2.      Stopping prices rising as much as they have done means relatingincreases in money incomes to the rise in output.    But it alsomeans seeing that producers of goods and services do not exploittheir market power at the expense of other sections of thecommunity.3.      Raising the real standard of living of the country meansmore capital investment in industry and more rapid adoption ofnew techniques.    But it also means making much more  effective useof the time workers spend on the job,  and persuading them toaccept links between increases in their pay and increases intheir productivity.k.      To secure a fairer distribution of incomes means that someof us must accept a little smaller increase in our incomes overthe years in order that those who are worse off can have more.There is no magic fund out of which we can improve the positionof low paid workers.5-       In all these aims,   the community has a choice which theGovernment  cannot make for it.     If we want price stability,  then we cannot all have large increases in pay every year regardless of the rise in productivity.    If we want our real standard ofliving to rise, we must be prepared to change the way in which work is organised and carried out.    If we want to improve theposition of those who are worse off,  the rest of us must beprepared to accept a little less ourselves.
C/260      The Green Paper   &quot;The Task Ahead&apos;   suggested that the risein output per man hour over the next  Cow years would be of theorder of 3% a year.     In 1968,   there was a particularly largoincrease in output per worker.    But this has not boon repeatedin 1969,  and it would be moat imprudent,   and  totally at variance with past experience,   to base policy on the hope thatthere will be an early change in the rate of increase of output per worker.     So if incomes rise by an average of more  than about% a year,   the result will inevitably be a rise in prices causedby higher labour costs.7.      Over the past decade,   incomes have in fact risen by muchmore than 3% a year-    The average has been 6 or 6%% a year.The simple and inevitable result of this has been a rise in pricesyear by year averaging something like  3%-     Everyone objects  torising prices.    The lowest paid workers and those on small fixedincomes suffer most from them.    yet the country as a whole has notbeen prepared to accept that stable prices are simply incompatible with large increases year by year in incomes which have not beenearned by higher productivity,,80       Moreover,   the  evils  flowing from a rise in money incomesfaster than the rise in output are not  confined to  a rise inprices.     It reduces  the  incentive  to save.    Our  export positiondeteriorates and this requires deflationary measures to put the  balance of payments right.9.      The Government believes  that what the community as a wholereally wants is a steady rise in real incomes coupled with abroad measure of price stability.    This  is what  the incomes policy aims at giving  the  community a chance to achieve over thenext few years.    Whether it succeeds depends not just on what theGovernment does,   but on what choices individual men and womenmake.    People con have large increases in pay - but with inflationwhich takes away much of the benefit.    Or they can have smallermoney increases whose real value is greater because prices are/kept
C/3kept stable and steady expansion is possibleu    In this senseany incomes policy is - essentially a voluntary policy operatingthrough the decisions of employers and trade unions.10o    None of these aims can be achieved by a prices and incomes policy narrowly conceived or operated in isolation from theother measures the Government is  taking to strengthen the economy,   increase industrial efficiency,   improve the structure of the labour marked and create a just society.    But within this wider strategy,   a prices and incomes policy is  essentialto achieve  the  following:-establishing on a firm and continuing basis the principleof links between higher pay and the more effective use oflabour;securing fundamental improvements in the methods of paynegotiation and settlement;creating proper wage and salary structures which willavoid successive leap-frogging settlements andeliminate friction;improving the position of low paid workers,  particularly by re-organisations which will make better use of their efforts,  and by the introduction of equal pay for women;raising the efficiency with which labour and capital equipment are used in all sectors of the economy:   private industry,  publicly owned industry,   and the public  services;ensuring that the larger industrial units now being brought,into existence use their resources  efficiently and to thebenefit of the  consumer,   and do not use   their increasedmarket power to operate pricing policies or pay policies which  fail to  take proper account of the wider publicinterest.
Do    EKAMEffQRK OF THE policy.   Any jjrices and incomes policy, whether statutory or voluntary, needs a framework within which those concerned with the determination of pay orprices can work in order to achieve the aims of the policy.   There are threeessential elements in such a framework;1.    guidance on the princij;les of the policy;2.   notification of pay settlements and price increases to the government so that discussion can take place as to whether they conform to those principles j3.   reference, where necessary, to an independent authority so that it canexamine whether the principles are being breached and advise on how theycan be applied more effectively.These elements will continue to form an essential part of the next phase ofthe policy.The role of the NBPI2.   One of the outstanding achievements of the policy since its inception hasbeen the part played by the NBPI in influencing the conduct of collective bargaining, stimulating interest in the more effective use of labour andscrutinising the case for price increases.   The first duty of the Board, on receiving a reference, has been to ascertain and publish the facts and the130 or so reports which it has produced since it was set up have built up a valuable body of information on the factors making for inflationary pay settlements and unjustifiable x^ice levels.    During the more stringent phasesof the policy the main task of the Board has been to advise whether or notthe individual pay settlements or price increases referred to it should be accepted as  being: in lice with the criteria of the White Paper current at the timeand under the I968 Act the Government has only been able to use its full stand-still powers where an adverse rexjort has been made by the Board.   But in forming a view on these cases the Board has always sought to take a positive rather thana negative line, making constructive XJroposals as to how pay settlements
&apos;11/2 &apos;&quot;might be brought into conformity with the policy or how a price increase mightbe avoided by absorbing costs.    In its first report the Board said it saw itself as &apos;promoting change by conducting a continuing dialogue with managements, unions and indeed Government1.    It has acted in this spirit.3.   Some of the most valuable work of the Board has been done through widerstudies of such general subjects as payment by results and job evaluation.   TheGovernment has also desired to emphasise the Board&apos;s constructive role by usingit to examine pay structures in a particular industry in order to try and influence subsequent negotiations, or to examine the relationship between costs and prices before a price increase was urgently sought.    In such cases it ispossible to allow the Board more time for a study in depth than the three monthsnormally available when a specific pay or price increase has to be considered,4.   As its work has developed the Board has increasingly stressed that the effective examination of specific pay or price increases inevitably leads onto the consideration of wider questions about the operation of a firm or industry:    how, for instance, it is tackling the problem of labour costs,whether it is making full use of capital equipment, whether it is investingadequately and whether its pricing policies generally are in the publicinterest.   These wider issues touch at many xjoints the functions of the monopolies Commission in considering whether monopolies or oligopoliesoperate in ways contrary to the public interest and the work of the two bodieshas tended increasingly to overlap.    It is for this reason that the Governmenthas decided to establish the Commission for Industry and Manpower to bringtogether and develop the work at present carried out by the monopolies commission and the NBPI and legislation to achieve this will be presented inthe current session of Parliament,5.   The Government will continue to refer to the Board and, in due course,to the Commission proposals for increases in prices and claims for increases in pay or pay settlements notified under the early warning arrangementswhenever these appear to require detailed examination.   The Board or the
contribute.iission will be required to examine then in the light of the guidance set outin the White Paper,   But the study in depth of wider issues of general importanceto the development of the policy in the public sector as well as private industry will continue to be an important part of their activities.(S,  In September 1967 the Government decided that all significant price increases proposed by the nationalised industries would be referred to the NBPI.   TheGovernment has now had the benefit of the Board&apos;s advice in a number of thesecases and considers that it is no longer essential to refer every increase tothe Board particularly where the Board has recently advised on the fundamentalsituation.   Each case will be considered on its merits as to whether furtheradvice would be helpful.    In the case of the nationalised industries as in thecase of the private sector, there will be occasions when the Board can reportocst constructively on the basis of references made before the point has comeKhere specific increases in charges by nationalised industries are a matter of extreme urgency.   The Board&apos;s work in this field will be be continued by theConcussion.1. The Board has already carried out a wide ranging efficiency study of onenationalised industry and has undertaken smaller-scale studies of others to explore the possibility of meeting needs for additional revenue throughreductions&apos; in costs rather than through increases in prices.   The government believes that the Board can play a role helpful to the nationalised industriesthenselves, to the Ministers responsible for policy in this field, and toinformed discussion of the major issues.   They will therefore continue to ask the Board, and later the Commission, to carry out studies of this kind where appropriate.SjjTINttiTION OF POWERS uTISER ,^ART II OF TiJE 1966 act the Government has always recognised that the full range of powers available under the i967 and i960 Prices and Incomes Acts to delay the implementation ofPty and price increases were called for only in exceptional circumstances and
as a short tern measure.    The delaying powers under the 1967 and 1968 Actsexpire at the end of 1969 and will nut be renewed.   The Government has howeverlaid before Parliament the necessary Order in Council bringing Part II of the1966 Act into force for a year beginning on January 1st 1970.9,   The purpose of the powers now being sought is twofold.    In the first placethey will enable the Government to require early warning of proposed pay and price increases.    Such notification is essential to the operation of anyprices and incomes policy, as the TUC has shown in asking its affiliatedunions to inform the General Council of impending pay claims.   The Governmentwelcomes the steps which the TUC is taking to examine such claims and to invitethe union or unions concerned to discuss them in the light of its own criteria,but it believes it is also necessary for the offers made and the settlementsreached in response to claims to be considered in the light of the guidancegiven in this \Jhlte Paper.10. It is equally important that proposals to increase the prices of goods or services of particular economic significance or importance to the cost ofliving should be notified to the appropriate government department so thatthey can be scrutinised.    In many cases this examination has been enough   toproduce modifications.   Between March 1968 and November 19^9, for example,about 20--b of the price increases notified were modified or withdrawn after discussion with government departments.U. In practice the early warning system has always operated on a voluntary basis.   The Government is grateful for the co-operation of industry and hopes that the voluntary basis can continue without the use of its reserve powers.A summary of the arrangements for notifying pay claims and proposed pay and price increases is given in Appendix 6.12. Examination of proposals may reveal the need for deeper scrutiny by thefrices and Incomes Board.   The second purpose of Part II powers is to enablethe Government to delay the implementation of a proposed increase of pay orprices for up to three months pending the Board&apos;s enquiry and report.   In this
nay the Board will be given a chance to examine whether the proposals arecontrary to the principles of the policy and to try to secure any necessaryaodifications before they are implemented.1), The Government believes that such powers are essential if the vital role of the NBPI is to be maintained in the coming months.   The functions of thenew Commission and the powers that will be necessary to enable it to dischargethen effectively are to be discussed with both sides of industry.   The Governmenthopes that it will not be necessary to perpetuate these delaying powers in thenew legislation.
E.   GUIDANCE FOR PAY NEGOTIATIONSE1.   GENERAL CHARACTER OF PAY SETTLEMENTS1.   To keep prices as stable as possible has been an objective of the policy since the Declaration of Intent was signed by representatives of employers,unions, and the Government in December 1964.   The cost of living can beaffected by a number of factors including the level of import prices and ofindirect taxation.   During 1968 prices were unavoidably inflated by theeffects of devaluation but price rises due to these influences are nowlevelling out and the main determinant of price levels in the coming months will be our success in relating increases in money incomes to increases in output.2.   In the next few years output per worker is likely to go up by about 3%a year.   If we are to avoid a steep increase in the cost of living,  thereforemoney incomes should only rise at about this rate.   This was the basiifl ofthe 1 norm1  of 3 to 3^ for pay settlements which formed the starting pointof the policy in 1965.   If output rise3 faster than expected then so canincomes.   The principle was accepted in 1964.   It is still true today.3.   This means that most wage and salary settlements need to fall in the range of 2$o - 4a$ increase in a year.   A range within which most settlementsneed to fall has been given because no single figure can be appropriate tothe circumstances of all negotiations.   Nor indeed will the average figurebe the same from one year to the next.   The appropriate level for aparticular settlement within this range will depend on a variety of factors,affecting the firm or industry, including the rate of increase in labour productivity, the extent to which low paid or women workers are involved,the labour market situation, and other matters relevant to pay negotiations.Opportunities must be given for changes in the relative pay of differentgroups of workers.
A.     Special care must be taken in deciding on the appropriate point in the range for industries where basic rates are negotiated at the national level buta substantial part of total earnings springs from payments of various kinds fixed by individual employers.    If these local elements tend to rise faster than the basic rates - as they do in some industries - then increases in the nationalbasic rates need to be kept at a lower level than in settlements whicheffectively determine the real level of earnings.   In the former cases a nationalsettlement needs to be in the lower part of the range - or indeed below it - ifit is not to be inflationary.   This principle is recognised by the T.U.C. inits own guidance to unions on pay claims.5.     Some settlements in any year will need to lie above the top of the normal range if the other objectives of incomes policy areto be achieved -encouraging a more rapid rise in productivity and securing a more rational and fair relationship between the pay of various groups of workers.   But such settle-ments need to be exceptional, not normal, if there is to be reasonable price stability.6.     All increases in pay, in any industry or finr. including those within the range, should, as far as possible, be covered by an increase in output per workerin that industry or firm,,7.     In the following sections, the main factors which come under consideration in individual pay negotiations are reviewed.   In most cases what needs to beconsidered is their bearing on the point within the range of 2-^2 - L^fo at whicha settlement should fall.   These sections also review the exceptional circumstances in which it might be appropriate for a settlement to be concludedfor a group of workers at a level outside the normal range.8.     The factors considered are:-(1) Productivity and Efficiency Agreements.(2) Re-organisation of Pay Structures.(3) Low-Paid Workers.(4) Equal Pay for Women,(5) Lab our Market Requirements.(6) Pay in the Public Services.
E.2     PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY AGREEMENTS1.     A central feature of the productivity, prices and incomes policythroughout its development has been to encourage management and workerstogether to find ways of increasing productivity and to relate pay toperformance.   And under the stimulus of the policy, productivity bargaininghas in the past four years spread widely through industry.   Over 6 million workers have been involved in over 3,500 productivity agreements.2.     The rapid spread of productivity bargaining has not occurred without raising some doubts and indeed criticism.   Some have felt that productivitydeals represented little more than the sale of restrictive practices(&quot;selling the rule-book&apos;) which should never have been allowed to develop.This is too narrow a view of most productivity agreements.     But more funda-mental criticisms were also made.3.     Productivity agreements usually provided for changes in working practicesto be accepted by the workers concerned in return for higher pay.   But whatthen of the position of workers who had never placed any restrictions on changes in working practice, and readily accepted the role of management toorganise work in the most effective way?   Would not the trend to productivitybargaining encourage such workers in future to demand a price for theiracquiescence in change?a.     Other critics argued that the real scope for productivity bargainingwas relatively narrow;    that many productivity agreements would have little effect in raising output per worker;    that some agreements were &quot;phoney&quot;designed simply to comply with the form of incomes policy and not itssubstance.   There were some workers for whom it was inappropriate to specify changes in working practice.
5.      Thirdly, concern was growing at the possible side-effects of productivity agreements covering particular groups of workers rather thanall workers in a firm or industry.   Specially large increases might beearned by a particular group in return for a change in working practices.But this led in due course to consequential increases to other workers inthe establishment (supervisors, maintenance workers, office staff) in orderto maintain what was regarded as a sound pay structure.   Moreover, speciallylarge increases in one year might raise expectations of similar increases in later years, when no similar increases in productivity would be possible.6.      In these circumstances, the Government decided it would be helpful ifthe N.B.P.I. carried out a fresh review of the situation.   The following conclusions emerge from their report (Report No. 123, Productivity Agreements,Cmnd. 4136) of July 1969:(a) productivity agreements have on the whole promoted goodindustrial relations;(b) productivity bargaining has reduced costs:   its effect was that productivity rose more than earnings 1(c) productivity agreements should not be once-for-allaffairs:   negotiations linking pay and productivityare a continuing possibility:   efficiency should be constantly raised on the basis of close and continuingco-operation between managements and workers;(d) non-manual workers can contribute as effectively asmanual workers to a more economical use of all the factors of production:   and forms of agreement are needed which can be used for their particular circumstances.7.      The N.B.P.I. concluded that the kind of points raised in paragraphs&apos;2 - 5 above required that its earlier guide-lines for effective productivity
agreements should be revised and broadened.   In particular the Board wishedto formulate them in terms clearly applicable to all types of workers, bothmanual and non-manual, including those workers for whom it is not appro-priate to specify changes in working practices.   The revised guide-linesapplying to efficiency agreements including productivity agreements are setout in Appendix 1.   The Government attaches particular importance to thefollowing pointss-(i)   In their new form the principles set out are clearly applicableto most workers:   maintenance workers as well as productionworkers:    office staff as well as factory workers:    supervisoryand professional staff as much as any other workers:   workersin the public sector as well as those in private industry and commerce.    This overcomes the difficulty previously experienced in applying a more narrowly conceived productivity bargaining&apos;to many groups of workers,(ii)   More thorough costing of agreements is needed in many cases.The N.B.P.I, in its report drew attention to the shortcomingsof many firms in this respect,(iii)   Consumers must share in the benefits of higher productivitythrough stable or lower prices if all sections of thecommunity are to share in rising national prosperity.In most cases rising productivity does not spring entirely from major changes in working practice or working methods.In some parts of the economy modern technology enablesoutput per worker to be increased specially rapidly andwithout extra effort.   In these cases particularly it wouldbe quite wrong for all the benefits of increased productivityto be enjoyed by workers and shareholders in the enterprise.
e/6The workers are entitled to a share because of their contribution to the increase in productivity and full allowance must be made for an adequate return on anyextra capital involved.   But the benefits of increased efficiency must be shared with the rest of the community,(iv)    In many industries efficiency agreements are made moredifficult for individual firms to conclude because theterms of national agreements and the process of collective bargaining itself take forms more appropriate to the days when the aim was to reach all the important decisions aboutpay at industry level.   In these industries both sides need to look again at their arrangements.   Often it would be rightto give up bargaining at industry level about &quot;basic&quot; or&quot;standard&quot; rates of pay because they are no longer realistic,and instead to concentrate nationally on setting adequateminimum standards and providing a proper framework withinwhich efficiency agreements can be concluded at companylevel.   Guidance from the centre, both by employers&apos;associations and by trade unions, can greatly helpefficiency bargaining to develop on sound lines.8.      Incomes policy has always accepted that workers who have contributed by their efforts to a rise in productivity are entitled to share in itsbenefits through higher pay.   In some such cases a reasonable share forthe workers concerned may permit a pay increase higher than the        whichis suggested above as the top of the normal range for settlements.9.       Increases in productivity should not be looked at as some isolatedelement in pay settlements entirely divorced from the other grounds for raising pay discussed in the following sections.   There is no logic inarguing that an increase in pay of 1% is needed in order to recruit an
E/7adequate labour force, and then in addition paying an extra Y.% as theworkers&apos; share of a productivity deal.   The Y% increase may well initself raise pay sufficiently to recruit the necessary labour.   Thevarious reasons which may exist for increasing pay should he considered together..10.     To sum up:-(i)   wherever practicable pay increases should be negotiated inthe context of an efficiency agreement - the N.B.P.I.&apos;sguidelines for which are set out in Appendix 1 - whichshould aim at increasing the efficiency with which use is made of the capital equipment and labour in theundertaking;(ii)   the increase in output per worker must be properly costedbefore deciding on the related pay increase; full allowancemust be made for an adequate return on extra capital employed;(iii) proper provision must be made for the whole community to benefit through using a reasonable share of the benefits for stable or lower prices;(iv)   in some cases pay increases above the 2-g$ -        normal range may be appropriate as the workers share of the risein productivity;(v)   but in many cases the rise in productivity will be no morethan sufficient to enable pay increases within the normal range to be made;(vi)   full account must be taken of possible consequential pay increases to other workers in the establishment; andthe desirability of spreading the benefits of a deal overa period rather than in a single exceptional rise;
e/8(vii) pay increases related to productivity should not be negotiated in isolation from pay increases on other grounds.
E 3RE OR GANISATION OF FAY STRUCTURES1o     The efficient use of labour and other resources can be madeimpossible by out of date - even chaotic - pay structures which have grown up over years, and decades, and which bear little relation tothe realities of present day working methods.   Where such a state ofaffairs has developed there may be no alternative to a thorough goingrationalisation of the whole grading and pay structure and thedistribution of duties amongst the workers.2.     Such a fundamental reorganisation may well involve increases in pay which, on average work out significantly above the normal rangefor increases of 2-g- to      per cent.   This may be justified both forthe employer and for the communily at large if it opens the way to substantial improvements in the efficiency with which labour is used.A more rational pay structure based on job evaluation may also reducethe risks of leap-frogging pay claims amongst&apos;the various groups ofworkers and eliminate causes of dissatisfaction among workers.The NBPI has produced a v iluable report on job evaluation and someextract:, from this report are given in appendix 2.3.     The full gains from such a reorganisation will however only berealised in the long term.    This makes it particularly important to associate a fundamental reorganisation of pay structure with theconclusion of an efficiency agreement through which the gains expected from the reorganisation are achieved.4.     Of course all pay systems and structures need to be kept in line with changes in the methods of work, and systems of organisation.   Butthis should be a continuous process, and there should be no need forexceptionally large pay increases to be given in connection with suchlimited changes.   Major reorganisations should become necessary onlyinfrequently - perhaps once in a decade.5.     Major reorganisations of pay structure have been carried through inmany firms and industries in the past five years.   But others also requiremajor changes.   Some have already been examined by the NBPI or in otherways.   The Government accepts the responsibility for carrying throughchanges which become necessary in the public services.   It will give allthe help it can to those trying to achieve reforms in other sectors of the economyo
E.4/11.     One of the weaknesses of the system of free collective bargaining has beenits inability to solve the problem of the low paid.   Many of them are poorlyorganised, and even where they are well organised they do not command economicpower.    That is one of the reasons why they are badly paid.   Under a systemwhere wage increases go to the strong, the low paid have difficulty in holdingtheir own, let alone improving their position.2.     One of the main aims of any productivity, prices and incomes policy mustbe   to remedy this failure of a free-for-all system.   Since 1965 the policy hasaimed to provide opportunities for improving the relative position of the low paid.   Under the criteria laid down, for instance, in the White Paper Command 3590,.which governed the use of the powers of the 1968 Act, low pay was held to besufficient justification for increases up to the ceiling - and indeed above the ceiling if other workers in the group were willing to let the low paid have priority.   But the decision to give that priority was left to the employers and unions concerned,&apos;  and although the gap between low paid and higher paid industriesnarrowed slightly it was not greatly reduced.3.     The challenge which faces us as a socially just society is what steps we cannow take to eradicate the scandal of low pay in an affluent society.   This willcall for a conscious, deliberate effort by all those involved - Government,employers and trade unions.   The first step must be to identify who are thelow paid and why they are low paid.   Here the D.E.P. has already taken theinitiative by launching in September 1968 a new Earnings Survey covering all industries and occupations and designed to discover the exact distribution of earnings behind the averages, by occupation, age and region.   It has also sought to identify some reasons for low pay.   whether for example it is associated withany particular age level, with payments in kind or with mental or physicaldisability.
4..     The survey shows that in October 1968 one in every 12 adult male workersin this country had total earnings for a full week of less than  15, at a timewhen the &quot;average&apos; adult male worker earned  26.     The position of women was much worse;    one in every 1+ adult women had earnings for a full week of  10 aweek or less.   The Survey showed that certain industries had a particularlylarge proportion of workers below these levels (farming, catering, and retail distribution are obvious examples).   But detailed analysis revealed that thegreat majority of low paid workers are scattered throughout industries whoseworkers, taken as a whole, are well paid.   It shows too, that the rea.sons forlow pay vary from group to group, almost from individual to individual.   Insome cases their reasons for low pay would be difficult to overcome.   Forexample,  some people are low paid because they are young and inexperienced;others because they have passed their productive peak.   Some workers prefer low paid jobs because they are less exacting and more suited to their abilities andtherefore their best hope of retaining a place in the labour market.   Theproblem therefore is in many cases too complex to be met by blanket increasescovering a whole industry, or even a whole occupation.5.     In recent years it has been suggested that the inequalities of a systemof free collective bargaining could be redressed by introducing a statutorynational &quot;minimum wage&apos;  or 1 minimum earnings&apos;.    The Government set up an inter-departmental working party to study the implications of a national minimum wage and its report (National Minimum Wage) provides a factual basis for informeddiscussions which the Government now hopes will take place.   The study shows the complexity of the problem of -helping the low-income groups.   For instance about two-thirds of the households in the country with an income of less than  15 aweek would not benefit from a national minimum wage as they do not contain anywage earners.    Again, a national minimum wage would have a very uneven effect in relieving poverty because it could not take account of family circumstances.
E.V3The question of low pay cannot therefore be separated from social servicepolicy.   But an even greater difficulty arises from the fact that, by far the greater number of low paid workers are scattered through industries wherethe general level of pay is relatively high.    If therefore, other wage earnersin these industries merely took the establishment of a national minimum as anew base on which to rebuild their existing differentials,  the cost of livingwould rise sharply;    and the low paid would in the end be no better off.Unfortunately there is at present little evidence that higher paid workers would not take advantage for their own purposes of the attempt to help thelow-paid through the establishment by law of a national minimum.6.     How, then, can the problem of low pay be tackled?   The first need is tostrengthen trade union organisation among these low paid groups and this willbe one of the aims of the Industrial Relations Bill.   Many of the occupationswhere low pay predominates are at present covered by Wages Council, and it is arguable that this protection, which was once essential is actually ahindrance today to the development of effective voluntary collective bargaining.The Industrial Relations Bill will make it possible to modify the WagesCouncil machinery where this has become desirable in the workers&apos; interests.
CONFIDENTIAL B:2*Ay.    Secondly, many groups of workers are low paid simply because theirproductivity is low..   Much could be done by employers, with the co-operation ofunions, to change working methods and so help the low paid to achieve higherearnings by sharply raising their productivity.   Here again the Government has given a lead by the emphasis it has laid on the productivity aspects of the policy.In many reports, the P.I.B. has spelt out the possibilities for improving the earnings potential of low paid workers in such activities as the retail draperytrade, local government and the National Health Service.   In some cases good progressthas been made in applying the Board&apos;s suggestions;    In others management still soemsunaware of, or indifferent to, the new techniques required.    One of the tasks ofthe department1s MPS has been to help management and union to follow up thepossibilities opened up by the Board&apos;s reports and the Government intends that theMPS shall play an increasingly active role in seeing that the proposals of the Board(and later the CIM) for improving the productivity - and therefore the earnings -\ of the low paid arc followed up urgently.18.    But when all this has been done the solution of this problem will still dependprimarily on the attitude of the negotiators in industry.   The only hope of the low&apos;i paid lies in a conscious decision by their follow workers that they will acceptI a re-assessment of differentials both between different industries and within an industry.   Some existing differentials are of course fully justified, proporlyreflecting additional responsibility or rewarding the acquisition of now skills.But this is,by no means true in every case;    and that is why the Government haswelcomed the increasing application of &quot;job evaluation1, not only in manufacturing industry, but for such groups as local government manual workers and ancillary workers in the MS in order to establish the worth of jobs on an objective basis.This can often lead to a reappraisal of the worth of jobs which are at present :- low paid.9.    Ono effective way of helping the low paid is to give priority to theimprovement of minimum earnings levels as has been done in engineering, rubberManufacturing, the food manufacturing industries, and the motor vehicle retailrepairing trade.   This enables much larger increases to be given to the low paid workers than to the rest of the workers in the industry.
E.4/510.     But neither job evaluation nor minimum earnings levels nor any othertechniques will succeed in improving the real position of the low paid workersunless employers and unions wish to do so.   Thero can be no improvement in theposition of the low paid, either relatively or in real terms, if every increasethey win becomes a new &quot;floor1  on which the existing spread of rates of pay is re-erected automatically, thus engendering, not social justice, but inflation,For instance, recent wage claims by dustmen and firemen aroused a good deal ofpublic sympathy in the belief that the pay of these groups of essential workers had fallen behind those of workers in manufacturing industry.   Yet once substantial increases had been granted, other   large claims wore immediately pressed by higher paid workers in industry on the grounds that if large increases were fair for thedustmen they were fair for the rest.^/711,     What is needed therefore is a study in depth of how real improvement in theposition of the low paid can be achieved in the context of particular situationsand particular systems of pay negotiation.   To do this the G-overnment intends toask the PIB (and later the CIM) to initiate investigations into those cases where&apos;low pay is a major problem and to suggest the means by which progress can be madecase by case, industry by industry.   /j&quot;The first references in this field will bo12.     The guidelines for pay settlements must take account of the need to improve the real position of the low paid.   The Government believes that at this stage ofthe policy more radical improvements in the position of the low paid are neededthan the normal range of 2^fo - ki% for other workers would allow.   Since themajority of low paid workers form comparatively small pockets in industries theycan be given increases above 1+1$, as part of an agreement falling within the normal range for pay settlements.   In a few industries however, like agriculture, thegeneral pay level is low and can only be improved by settlements above the normal range.   That is why the Government has recently approved a wage increase of Q^fofor farm workers who are by far the lowest paid industry for men workers.
Since, however, the numbers involved in these industries form a very small partof the total labour force, increases above the normal range here should not meanan intolerable addition to the wages bill provided that workers in other industriesdo not take this as a signal to step up their own claims.13.     The Government will be guided by the approach in this White Paper in dealingwith its own employees.   But here too the unions will have the responsibility of deciding whether, and to what extent they are prepared to co-operate in givingpriority to the low paid within settlements which on average fall within thenormal range.14..     The Government invites unions and employers to join with it in working oursolutions to the problems of the low paid workers, who have been unjustifiablyleft behind in the scramble of wage bargaining, within the context of the policy outlined above.   Only in this way can social justice be achieved withoutimperilling our economic recovery.
E 5/1E 5   Equal pay.     As the National Minimum Wage report points out, women comprise the greatmajority of low paid workers.   Any policy designed to lift the levels of lowpay will therefore be concerned to a very great extent with women.2.     There are many reasons why women earn less than men.   Differences in average earnings in some cases reflect differences in skill or the fact that women work little overtime.   But the report indicates two contributory causes;1.    &quot;Women&apos;s rates, including Wage Council rates, are generallybetween two thirds and four-fifths of the corresponding male rates&quot;;2.   industries where very low pay is found &quot;tend to have a relatively high proportion of women who are employed in small firms and whom the trade unions find it very difficult to organise&quot;.3.   It is for these reasons, as &quot;well as on grounds of naturaljustice, that the Government has decided to legislate on equal pay.It has announced its intention to introduce legislation which wouldmake discrimination in remuneration on grounds of sex illegal bythe end of 1975.   The full implementation of equal pay means thatthere will be a statutory obligation to give many women increases ofthe order of 25 to 30 per cent over the next six years to bring their rates up to the present level of men&apos;s rates.   The government believes it would be right for equal pay to be introduced by stagesover this period.   In negotiations between now and 1975 there will therefore need to be increases in many women&apos;s rates substantially greater than those in men&apos;s rates.4.   Overall, the Government estimates that the introduction of equal pay will increase the national wage and salary bill by between 3^and hfr/o between now and the end of 1975.   This is not a large amount in comparison with the increase of perhaps 20% in output per headwhich is likely to occur during that period.   Overall it should be
possible to accommodate it without raising significantly the averageyearly increase in money incomes throughout the economy.   indeed in many individual firms it should be possible to move towardsequal pay without taking pay settlements outside the normal range.5.   This cost will however be spread unevenly over the economy, andwill fall particularly on firms employing a high proportion ofwomen at rates well below those of men doing similar work.   Insuch oases the Government recognises that the introduction of equal pay will only bo possible through pay settlements which on average work out significantly above the normal range.6.   As with low paid workers generally women are, in many cases,used less efficiently than they might ho.   Indeed low rates of pay have in the past reduced the incentive to use women&apos;s labourmore productively.   Surveys in many industries have revealed, the opportunities for reorganising women&apos;s worth so as to raise theirproductivity.   And if these opportunities are taken this in itselfwill cover at least part of the cost of introducing equal pay.7.   By definition moves towards equal pay for women cannot be used,as arguments for increasing men&apos;s rates of pay;    nor should they be used as arguments for increases in the pay of those women whoalready enjoy equality in rates.   Equal pay for women is one move towards a fairer and more rational structure of pay.   Like all suchmoves it involves changes in traditional pay differentials.   Thecommunity must accept these changes - as much us they accept theprinciple of equal pay.
labour market requirements1.     Many pay increases are defended by employers on the grounds thatthey are necessary to keep their pay in line with &apos;market rates&apos; andso enable them to retain their workers or recruit additional labourwhere this is needed.   These arguments are not oonfined to situationswhere there is an immediate labour supply problem.   Employers oftenargue that they need to increase the pay of their workers eitherto match rates paid in other undertakings or changes in rates of earnings elsewhere, because otherwise labour supply difficulties will soon emerge.   They argue that it is both foolish, and unfair to theirworkers, to wait until the situation deteriorates visibly.   For their part, unions often place great weight in negotiations on changes inthe pay of other groups of workers who have had increases since their last settlement.2.     Without doubt some weight must be given in pay negotiations tothe effects of pay on the maintenance of an adequate labour force inthe firm or industry concerned.   Clearly for this purpose some account must be taken of comparisons with the pay of workers doing similar jobs in the same area, or with the pay for different jobs to which workerscould move.   And in jobs requiring special skills or training pay has got to be kept at levels which will encourage at adequate rate of recruitment in the long term.3.     The question which needs to be asked in terms of incomes policyis how much weight should be attached to these factors, as comparedwith the linking of pay to performance, or with producing a stable and equitable pay structure.   In practice agreements based on so-calledlabour market requirements and, therefore, on comparisons with the pay of others have played, and continue to play, too large a role in pay negotiations.4-.     In national negotiations immediate labour supply difficulties will rarely constitute a sound argument for an exceptional increasein pay.    The labour supply situation differs from one part of thecountry to another - often from one firm to another.   No single increasein pay is likely to be apt for all.   An individual employer may howeverfind himself unable to recruit enough labour to meet an expansion ofhis business;    or may face an increase in labour turnover, and in
particular, may find some of his best workers leaving for other jobswhere they can get higher pay.5.     However, simple comparisons with levels of pay in other firms or with changes in rates paid by other firms are usually so over-simplifiedas to give only poor guidance to the case for a pay increase on labour supply grounds.   As regards absolute levels of pay there is now ampleevidence of the fact that quite large differences in earnings by thesome type of worker between one firm and another in the same areacan exist for long periods of time without leading to a loss of labour by the firms with apparent lower pay.   In. such cases the differenceprobably reflect other factors making it preferable to work for oneemployer rather than another.   It is virtually impossible to assessall the factors which may influence an individual worker&apos;s choice ofemployer and job.   A case for a pay increase simply on the grounds that rates of earnings in a particular enterprise are below those of similar jobs in other enterprises demands, apart from anything else,a most careful analysis of all the facts about the conditions ofemployment and the- job itself and actual earnings.   Jobs which, onthe face of it, appear to be the same may be found under detailed examination to have significant differences;    and earnings turn out to be much the same, although rates differ.6.     Simple comparisons made with pbunges^in pay in other jobs are alsounlikely in themselves to provide clear grounds for any particularincrease.   In the first place, all depends on the assumption thatat some previous date the relationship with pay in the other jobs was entirely appropriate;   and there is seldom much evidence of this.In the second place, comparisons are only too often with changes insome general index of wage rates or earnings and not with the changesin pay of truly comparable jobs in the same area.7. In any case, an effort to deal with actual or impending labour supply difficulties simply by increasing pay is seldom likely to bethe solution.   Employers need to consider with their workers whether:-(i)    an efficiency agreement (or a revision of an earlier one)would meet the situation by at once reducing the labour requirementand increasing the rewards for the job;
(ii) full advantage has been taken of all possible scope for internal transfers, training and retraining of the existingwork force;(iii) the causes of excessive overtime absenteeism or labourturnover have been established and appropriate action taken;(iv) methods of attracting and recruiting labour are themselvesadequate.8.     Such measures are particularly important since straight increases in pay are often unlikely permanently to secure extra labour or toprevent a loss of labour.   A labour shortage in a particular firm is often no more than a reflection of a general shortage of that kindof labour in the area.   In such cases an increase in pay by one firmis likely simply to be copied by other firms;    in the end the pay increases will not have helped significantly to meet the labour shortage concerned.9.     All this means that too much weight must not be placed on simplykeeping rates of pay in line with those of other workers as a meansof maintaining an adequate labour force.   Nevertheless, it is onefactor which employers need to consider;    and it may well affect thelevel of pay increase within the normal range which is appropriate ina particular case.   But to make pay increases significantly abovethe normal range merely on labour supply grounds is something whichneeds very strong justification indeed.   And it should only be&apos;contemplated if, in addition to the consideration mentioned inparagraphs 7 and 8:-(a) detailed information is available about comparative pay and earnings for clearly similar jobs;    and(b) the discrepancy revealed is so substantial that even withan increase of hpf/o in pay the employer is still likely to be left with serious labour difficulties.10.   Even when no special problems of labour supply exist, comparisons with the level of pay in similar occupations, or with average increases in pay of all workers, often assume a crucial role (either implicitor explicit) in pay negotiations.   This springs, perhaps from a
widespread and no doubt natural feeling that, when the national wealthis increasing year by year, the increase should be shared throughoutthe working population.   No doubt it also springs from an equallywidespread, if less admirable, feeling that each worker is entitledto have as large an increase as the next man or woman.   If the general level of pay increases were no greater than the increase in national production, the use of comparisons as the basis for pay increases mightnot be positively harmful, although it would obstruct many desirablechanges.   But in present circumstances, general use of the&quot;comparability1 argument as a basis for pay increases is a recipe forinflation.   This is particularly true of claims based on:-ihc mere maintenance of traditional relationships which haveno economic justification;the restoration of differentials between higher and lowerpaid workers following an increase given deliberately to improve the position of the lower paid;the restoration of pay relativities which have altered overthe years as a result of changes in the social structure;the matching of pay increases earned by other workers underproductivity agreements.11.   This is not to say that comparisons with changes in the pay ofother workers arc wholly in relevant in considering pay.    Supervisorsneed to be paid more than line workers, and craftsmen should normallyearn more than unskilled workers in the same plant.   Chaotic paystructures can only lead to future trouble.   Moreover, in skilledoccupations the question of future recruitment may be highly relevant.A profession where salaries decline markedly in relation to others may,in ten years time, find itself badly short of young entrants.12.   It is important that workers in an enterprise should feel theyare being fairly treated.   It is not enough to reduce the emphasis oncomparability.   Management must also create other opportunities for improving pay.   And care must be taken to see that pay differentialsare not changed so fast or so far as to create serious difficultiesin labour relations.   All these matters must bo considered in decidingon the appropriate size of pay increase within the normal rangefor s e t tie ment s .
E 6/513-   To sum up:-(i) Tho need to maintain an adequate labour force must be onefactor in deciding on the level of pay settlements and for thispurpose some account must be taken of changes in the pay ofother workers;(ii) But a comparison v/ith pay of other workers must be treated with reserve;    and wherever possible labour supply problems shouldbe overcome by the more efficient use of existing labour, thusenabling pay to be raised without adding to costs;(iii) An increase above the normal range on grounds of labour shortage can be qualified only when comparisons with the pay ofother workers have been carried out with special care, anddisparities revealed which are so large as to be intolerable.
E.7/1Pay in the Public services,     Subject to what is srid below, the guidance set out in this White Paperapplies to the settlement of pay in the public services as much as to thesettlement of pay in the private sector and in the nationalised industries.The Government&apos;s continuing policy is to see that workers in the public services are treated on the same basis as those in other sectors of the economy.2.     Some special problems always arise in settling pay in the public services.In the first place,  the nature of the jobs done by many workers in the public services (eg teachers, doctors) makes it impracticable to measure their output for the purpose of making a direct link between efficiency and pay.   This does not mean their efficiency cannot be raised but it has to be done by other means.Secondly, though the cost of labour can be measured as readily as elsewhere, a market price cannot normally be assigned to the value of its output because theoutput is not sold in a competitive market.   This removes one of the major factors which bear on pay in other sectors of the economy.   Thirdly, movement in and outof the public services tends to be restricted not only by the career nature of much of the employment, but also by the limited opportunities for employmentelsewhere in the same kind of job for some occupations in the public services.This means that an unduly low level of pay in a public service may take a relatively long time to show itself in labour supply difficulties.    Finally,since the Government is directly or indirectly involved in all pay settlements in the public services, there are strong pressures for broad uniformity oftreatment, in spite of the large numbers and varied occupations involved.3.     The first three of these problems means that, for many public servants,more reliance has to be placed in determining pay on the closest comparisonspossible with the pay of workers doing similar jobs in the private sector.    in exceptional cases such as the police, for whom there are no counterparts in theprivate sector, close comparisons are not possible and, where the method of comparison has to be used, more generalised comparisons with pay elsewhere are difficult to avoid.
E.7/24.     In all cases where comparisons are used as a basis for determining pay and increased pay cannot be directly linked to increased efficiency, the attainment of higher levels of efficiency will continue to be sought by other means.    Indeed, the more extensive use of comparisons in determining the pay ofpublic servants imposes a unique responsibility on employers, unions and workers to seek to maximise efficiency by every possible means precisely because therewill be no direct pay incentive for so doing.5.     In order to ensure the consistency of pay settlements with the guidancegiven in the White Paper, the Government will continue where appropriate toask the NBPI and, in due course, the Commission for Industry and Manpower, toreport on particular&quot; issues in the public services.   But even more important,the Government intend to use the Board and its successor to make periodic reviews of the pay structures in various parts of the public services and, in particular,to advise on ways in which changes in pay structures and the organisation of thework can increase the efficiency of the sector concerned.
Eb/lE 8 SOME DETAILELi^CONSITERATIONS1.   The guidance set out in the previous sections has been related primarily topay settlements.    It is mainly concerned therefore with increases in rates of pay, whether at the national or local level, whether of wage or salary earners,rather than with actual earnings which will be affected by the number of hours worked;    by levels of output under p.b.r. schemes;    by pay increments or meritawards within pay scales;   by pay increases on promotion to more responsiblejobs;    and by other factors.2.   Nevertheless, increases in rates of pay need to take account of some other major factors affecting earnings.    For example, a reduction in normal hours oran increase in the length of holidays must usually be treated on all fours withan increase in rates of pay.    Such changes will increase unit costs of productionjust as much as a pay increase.3.   id.though increases in rates of pay above the normal range represent the biggest inflationary risk, other elements in pay can easily be handled in aninflationary manner by employers, as enquiries by the NBPI have repeatedlyshown.    Overtime can be used simply as a way of raising earnings rather thanbecause it is essential.   Payments by results schemes can easily get out ofcontrol;    guidelines for assessing whether a p.b.r. scheme is working successfullyor is in need of overhaul are set out in Appendix 3.    Posts may be upgraded ormerit pay given as an alternative to raising basic rates.    Some types ofincremental scale may be found in practice to cost more year by year creating a kind of &apos;salary drift&apos;  corresponding to &apos;wage drift&apos;*.    In such cases the resultant increase in earnings can well be seriously inflationary.    There is novirtue in an employer keeping a pay settlement within the normal range ifincreases in average earnings far exceed Ajsf/o in these ways.5.   It is wholly undesirable for pay settlements to be reached at intervalsshorter than twelve months.   If one pay settlement follows another at an interval of less than a year it is impossible to assess properly the effects ofthe earlier one in achieving what it set out to do.    Time is needed to assess the working out of the costs and benefits of a productivity agreement or tosee whether a rise in pay has had the effect expected on recruitment or labourturnover.   Moreover, increases at short intervals for workers in one industry are disturbing to those who Work in other industries     In many cases, payagreements covering periods longer than twelve months would be appropriate.This possibility is discussed fully in the NBPI Report No. 132 in salary Structures (Cmnd. 4178).
6. Where an agreement takes effect after an interval of more than a year fromthe last one, a settlement larger than l+^/o would, of course, still be withinthe normal range provided that it is not more than an annual rate of l^f0 sincethe last improvement. But there is no reason why a settlement whose operative date is more than 12 months after the last one should, merely on this account,be above 4ifo.
li    &amp;U1BAI\CB ICR DETERiilXIXG PRICES AMD CHARGES1.     The Continuing aims of prices policy are to ensure that industry and commerce contain as far as possible cost increases by improvements in efficiency and to restrict increases in prices to those which can be demonstrated to be inevitable because of increases in costs which cannot be offset by increased efficiency or which are needed to finance new investment.   Otherwise price increases either channel an excessive proportion of the national income intoprofits at the expense of wage and salary earners, or imply the toleration of continuing inefficiency, or both,,   All price increases tend to exaggeratedemand for higher pay and so give a   further twist to the wage/price spiral,,It is essential, therefore, that no price increase should be made which doesnot satisfy the requirenontc of the policy   Nor is it enough to restrainunjustified price increases,,   Reductions in price need to be made where theseare practicable 0   Greater price cou.petitiver.ess will enhance the advantagefor home-produced over imported goods in Britain and help expand our exporttrade B2.     It has been argued that the ordinary working of competitive forces in the economy ensures that prices do not rise faster than is made inevitable by changes in such costs ac those of labour, materials and capital.   TheGovernment recognise the part that competition on the part of the efficientfirm pays in promoting stable prices.   In practice, however, the effectivenerrof competitive forces in preventing unjustified price increases, in controllingincreases :1a labour costs? and in ensuring the most rapid rise possible in productivity varies greatly from one sector of the economy to another and fromone industry to another.   Only in a few sectors of the economy is it likely that competitive forces are so strong as to ensure over long periods of timethe lowest possible prices.   Even though there may be no monopoly, thereare often circumstances in which competition, though present, is weak and not wholly effective in restraining prices.
F/23.     The methods by which wages and salaries are fixed in many branches of the economy mean that a group of firms can reasonably expect the general trend of labour costs to be broadly the same throughout the group;    and may leadtherefore to a general expectation that increases in the wage and salary bill will be passed on by all firms in the form of higher prices.   In other areasof the economy, difficulties in the way of firms entering the market,limitations of consumer knowledge and choice inhibit full competitionparticularly 011 prices.1+.     The Government1 s policy is to increase efficiency in the economy by directattempts (including the restructuring of industry) to stimulate it and toincrease effective competition by the reform of the procedures for negotiatingwages and salariest and by improving consumer information and protectionservices.   The&apos;National Board for Prices and Incomes and the monopolies commission, and the new body which is to be established to supersede them,will have an important role to play.   But these fundamental remedies fordealing with weaknesses in the free market will inevitably take time toproduce their full effect;    and, meanwhile, the Government consider it essential to continue to scrutinise the justification for major price increases and its efforts to ensure that no opportunities of price reductions are lost.The circumstances in which price increases may be necessary are reproduced in Appendix A.5*     Generally no price increase   can be justified until a full account hasbeen taken of all opportunities for cost reduction which are open to theundertaking.   In most undertakings there are opportunities, over time, for improvements in unit labour costs and capital utilization which can offset,at least to some extent, other increases.
6.     The criteria provide in certain circumstances for increases in prices tocover increases in labour costs.   But if this argument for price increasesis used, it needs most careful scrutiny because of the savings in unit labour costs which are usually open to management.   Bearing in mind the average increase in productivity, most firms should be able to absorb all, or at anyrate most, of the cost of that part of any settlement which falls withinthe 1 normal range&apos;.   Firms will be expected to show in the case of any settlement good grounds for not absorbing costs to this amount.   If asettlement arises from an efficiency agreement the cost should automaticallybe met from the savings flowing from the agreement.7.     The criteria require firms to consider whether increases in costsought to be absorbed in whole or in part by a reduction in the rate of return on capital employed.   This does not mean that the Government believes thatany general reduction would be desirable in the level of return on capital invested in British industry, whether privately or publicly owned.   A general depression of profit margins would almost certainly result in an inadequatesupply of capital becoming available in the long run for investment in industry.8.     Nor does it imply that any single figure is appropriate for the levelof return on capital either for all industries, or for all firms in aparticular industry.   Exceptional efficiency, rapid technical innovation, ora high degree of risk may properly be associated with a higher return on capital in a particular firm or industr3r than would be appropriate for others.9.     Moreover, in some undertakings the return on capital may in recent   years have been at too low a level.   Or the return on existing capital may be nowtoo low to promise an adequate return on new investment needed to provide adequate capacity for the future.   In such circumstances a price increasedesigned to improve the return on capital may be appropriate.
10.   Nevertheless, the return on capital achieved in recent years is notsomething sacrosanct.   It requires to be re-examined in the light of changing circumstances.   And the Government will continue to examine with special careproposed price price increases v/here the return on capital may have been maintained at a high level in situations where price competition has been weak.11.   Price stability in the economy as a whole can be achieved only if, incertain sectors, price reductions occur to effect inevitable increaseselsewhere.   The circumstances in which price reductions   are called forare set out in Appendix 5.12.   In those sectors of the economy where technical innovation orrationalisation of facilities offer opportunities for cost reductions wellin excess of the national average, this needs to be reflected in price reductions.   A prices and incomes policy which works fairly for the whole community requires that the whole benefit of the cost reductions in thesesectors should not go to the workers and share-holders in the firms concerned.13.   Increased prices, particularly of food stuffs, due to changes in supply for seasonal or other reasons are unavoidable, but where prices rise for these reasons they should fall again when supplies are plentiful.1k.   The criteria, and the considerations set out above, are intended to beapplied by all concerned, including wholesalers and retailers, in the determination of prices for the sale of goods, and charges for the performance of services, on the home market in both the private and publicsectors.   This includes all concerned in the negotiation of prices underindividual contract.
G.  GUIDANCE FOR DETERMINING DIVIDENDS1.   Prom the   outset of the policy in 1965 the Government has emphasised its intention to use its fiscal powers or other appropriate means to correct any excessive growth in aggregateprofits, whether distributed or not,  as compared with the growth of total wage and salaries.    Total company profits, as well asthe profits of individual companies s fluctuate sharply from year to year (usually increasing in periods of expansion ofproduction) whereas total wages and salaries increase eachyear.    It is therefore the trend in profits that matters, rather that short-term fluctuations.    In fact the trend over the past20 years has been for profits to form a somewhat lower proportionof the total gross domestic product.2.    The 1968 Budget introduced a 3h- ceiling on increases in individual company dividends as a necessary re-re-inforcement ofthese policies.    It was a short-term measure associated withstringent control of other incomes and. prices.3.    A ceiling for dividends paid out by individual companies is undesirable as a long-term policy.    A fixed ceiling can seriouslydistort the ability of expanding firms to raise adequateadditional capital in the market.    It may expose firms to take-over bids on terms which do not properly reflect the value of theundertaking to be acquired.    Control of individual dividendsblurs the distinction amongst investors between firms whichare expanding; foheir profits through increased efficiency andare ploughing them back and firms which are not energeticallyimproving their position.    It does not encourage new investmentto go where it will yield the highest return and so make thegreatest contribution to higher national productivity.G.l.
CONFIDENTIALli..    Moreover control of the level of distributed profits doesnot in itself reduce the share of the national product going tothe owners of capital; nor in the long run the amount of spendableincome available to individual shareholders.    For if profits arenot distributed they must be ploughed back into the business orinvested outside; and either way the gains belong to the share-holders and are likely in due course to be reflected in the values of the shareholding over time.    Over a period of years a restriction in distributed profits may do little more than replacecurrent income by capital gains which are taxed at a lower rate.For these reasons the y% per cent ceiling scheme for    dividendswill come to an end on 31st December, 1969:.5.    It will  still continue to be necessary for companies to observe moderat on when distributing profits.    It will remainpossible    if the need should arise for the Government to require -notification of individual dividend increases under Fart II ofthe Prices and Incomes Act 1966.    And the Government may refer to the N.B.P.I. or,  later to the Commission for Industry and manpower cases where the growth of profits and dividends appearto be based on price levels made possible by excessive marketpowea.G. 2.
HZ&apos;&apos;H,  RENTS AND RATESRENTS1.    Rent affects the household budget of millions of families.   During 1968and 1969 the Government successfully prevented undue increases in rents.2,    In the private sector, the great majority of unfurnished tenancies otherthan those which are still controlled are subject to the rent regulation systemset up by the Rent Act 1965-     In general the rent of such tenancies can beincreased only as the result of the determination of a fair rent by a rentofficer or rent assessment committee.     In some cases the rent will previouslyhave been low, and the determination of the new rent can involve sharp increases.Under Part III of the Prices and Incomes Act 1968 the Housing Ministers haveensured that such increases occurring during the latter half of 1968 and in 1969will have been spread out, or &quot;phased&quot;, in annual stages.3.    Part III of this Act also required local authorities to obtain the consentof the Housing Ministers to any increase in the rents of council houses.   many local authorities have followed the Government&apos;s advice and refrained from making avoidable rent increases.   But in some cases the Housing Ministers had touse their powers to prevent rent increases which were not justified by rising costs or which an authority could avoid by, for example, using housing accountbalances.   In addition they adopted the recommendation of the National Board for prices and Incomes that the rents of tiny Council should not be increased by morethan 7s 6d on average in a 12-month period.   Ministers have also been unwilling toauthorise increases of more than 10s a week for any individual house in any year.4.    The powers in the 1968 Act governing rent increases expire at the end of&quot;1969. /&quot;The Government consider that restraint in rent increases must continueto be an integral part of prices and incomes policy^/7   Measures are thereforebeing taken to continue the restriction of sharp rent increases for a further period, and a Bill is before Parliament.
H/25.     For regulated tenancies, phasing of rent increases is to continue for two more years.    This will apply to rents registered up to the end of 197&quot;!, and willcomplement the phasing arrangements already introduced under the Housing Acts of1969 for rent increases resulting from the conversion from rent control to rentregulation of houses in good repair, or from grant-aided improvements.60    For council rents, the G-overnment believe that the principles justifyingincreases are now well established and understood and should as far as possible beapplied by the local authorities themselves0    The Housing Ministers have accordingly agreed with the local authority associations that rents would beincreased only to meet unavoidable increases in costs on the basis of guide-lines which are being recommended to their members for observance during theperiod 1 January 1970 to 30 June 1971.7.     During this period the Ministers,  for their part, are seeking power to controlthose increases which in any 12-month period exceed 7s 6d a week on average of10s a week for any individual house.   Any authority wishing to increase rentsbeyond these limits will require the Minister&apos;s prior consent.   This is unlikely to be forthcoming save in the most exceptional circumstances.8.    Ministers will continue to ensure under the existing arrangements thatrestraint in rent increases is applied to houses owned by New Towns and theScottish Special Housing Associations.RATES9.    Rates, as a form of taxation, are outside the scope of prices and incomes policy:    they are necessary to help pay for the range of services provided bylocal authorities.   Better services are bound to cost more money, but theGovernment have taken steps to reduce the impact of rates on householders by providing special grants which have reduced the amount in the   they have to pay,
H/by 5d in the   in 1967/8, 10d in the   in 1968/69 and 1s 3d in the   this year;the reduction in 1970/71 will be 1s 8d in the  .   As a result of this, and ofthe savings made by local authorities, domestic rates were held steady, on average, in 1967/68 and 1968/69, and went up by only l+^fo in 1969/70.   Thereis every reason to believe that most householders will have little more to payin 1970/71, though larger increases may be unavoidable in some areas.   Inaddition the income limits for rate rebates were raised from October 1968 andthis has helped many householders with small incomes, particularly those with large families.    In Scotland, where rate poundages are higher than in Englandand Wales, special grants have reduced the amount which householders would otherwise have had to pay by 10d in the   in 1967/68, 1s 8d in the   in 1968/69and 2s 6d in the   this year.   With this assistance, domestic rates increased on average by only 7d in the   between 1966/67 and 1968/69.    It is not yetpossible to say what the position will be in 1969/70, because of the laterrating year in Scotland.
APPENDIX /No Bo P. I. G-UIDELINES FOR EFFICIENCY AGREEMENTS INCLUDING-PRCJJUCTIVITY agreements the following guidelines are reproduced from paragraph 133 of N.B.PJ,report number 123 on productivity agreements (Cmnd. 4136).   Each guideline is accompanied by a brief note, the purpose of which the Board says, is to clarify its meaning and intended practical application.1st GuidelineIt should be shown that the workers are contributing towards the achievement of constantly rising levels of efficiency.   Where appropriate,major changes in working practice or working methods should be specified inthe agreement.The objective of efficiency agreements is to make possible the constantraising of efficiency;    this will require close and continuing co-operationbetween managements and workers so as to achieve and maintain the higheststandards in the use of both equipment and manpower.   The second sentence hasspecial reference to agreements which specify major changes in working practice to which workers have agreed.    Such changes should always be spelled out ifthere is any possibility that commitments in more general terms will lead to difficulties of interpretation cr will not be given full expression inpractice.2nd GuidelineMeasurements of efficiency ,-hould be based on the application of relevant.. indices of performance or work standard,-;,,Managements should Revise end use appropriate yardsticks for measuringthe contribution of workers of all kinds towards achieving rising levels of efficiency and develop an information system which makes full use of the dataobtained as a result.   For many manual operations work-studied standards are applicable and should be used,but work measurement can also be applied to a wide range of clerical and other non-manual work.   For other workers in othersituations it will be necessary to use more broadly-based indicators of performance, if necessary on a group basis-/3rd Guideline
-   2   -3rd GuidelineA realistic calculation of all the relevant costs of the agreement and ofthe gains attributable to the workers&apos; contribution should normally show thatthe effect is to reduce the total cost of output or the cost of providing a given service.&quot;Relevant costs&quot; may include, for example, the cost of redundancy paymentsor a proportion of consultants&apos; fees where they are an integral part of anagreement, and these should be apportioned as necessary over a reasonable period rather than charged only to the first year following the agreement.The &quot;gains attributable to the workers&apos;  contribution&quot; may result from more effective working methods, the fuller utilisation of existing capital equipment, the adaptation of working practices to enable full and prbmpt use to be made of new equipment and reduced capital investment (if for examplerevised scheduling and shift-working make possible a smaller transportfleet).    The reference to a reduction in costs assumes a calculation for thepurpose of which unrelated costs, e.g. the price of raw materials, are leftout of account.4th GuidelineThere should be effective controls to ensure that projected increases inefficiency are achieved and that higher pay or other improvements are made only when such increases are assured.In order to observe this guideline managements must operate effectivecontrols, including an information system which makes it possible to estimatein advance and subsequently monitor the extent to which increases in effiencyare in fact being achieved.    In so far as the information system shows that progress exceeds or falls short of the original projection, some adjustmentmay need to be made.    In any case due allowance should be made for the accrualof some of the achieved gain to the consumer.   Particular care also needs tobe taken to distinguish the contribution of workers from other sources of more efficient working./5th Guidline
-   3   -5th GuidelineThere should be clear benefits to the consumer by way of a contribution tostable or lower prices.This guideline is of particular importance in areas of rapid economic expansion, since the most needs to be made of opportunities to reduce prices inthese areas/in order to contribute as much as possible to raising the real incomes ofthe community as a whole.    In some cases the community may benefit by animprovement in quality while prices remain unchanged or by the use of the gainsto compete more effectively in export markets.6th GuidelineAn agreement applying to one group of workers only should bear the costof consequential increases to other groups, if any have to be granted.An example would be if supervisors have to be given a pay increase toprevent the disappearance of a differential as a result of a pay increasegranted to the workers whom they supervise.   The need for consequential increasesunrelated to increases in efficiency should, however, be reduced as much aspossible by enabling other groups of workers to conclude their own efficiencyagreements or by including them within the scope of the original agreement.7th GuidelineNegotiators should avoid setting levels of pay or conditions which mighthave undesirable repercussions elsewhere.Where large increases in pay are shown to be justified negotiators should consider the possibility of staging the increases over a period of time, or,alternatively, of a non-recurring lump sum payment.   Failure to do so mightraise expectations for future increases which could not be fulfilled andImight also because of the exceptional size of the increases have repercussionswhich would eventually rebound on the undertaking granting the originalincrease.
JOB EVALUATION1.    Attention is drawn to Report No. 83 of the National Board for Prices and incomes on Joh Evaluation (Cmnd.3772) from which the following information hasbeen taken.2.     The Board say that job evaluation means the comparison of jobs - not ofmen - by formal procedures to determine their place in a hierarchy and thus offersa basis for a structure of pay which, while initially it cannot depart too farfrom the historical pattern, can be accepted as having reason behind it.   It thuscontrasts with ad hoc decisions as a whole.   Since it is an attempt to found anentire structure of pay in reason, the Board say that they have come to the broadconclusion that it is a valuable instrument from the point of view of management,from that of the unions, and from the general point of view in that it candiminish tension on the shop floor.3.     The Board point out that the introduction of a scheme will normally be attendedwith an increase in costs, if only because those who have been downgraded willeither receive personal allowances or have their pay unchanged, while those whoare up-graded will have their pay increased.   It is desirable, therefore, for theintroduction of a scheme to be accompanied wherever practicable by arrangementsmaking for increased productivity so as to offset as much as possible the extra cost to be incurred.   Even in the absence, however, of arrangements relating toproductivity, it should be feasible in the Board&apos;s view to estimate the cost ofthe scheme as compared with what labour costs might otherwise have been.   It ispossible, nonetheless, that the benefit will be long-term and a short-term increasein costs cannot be avoided./k.   The Board
-   2  -4.     The Board suggest (i) that where the introduction of a job evaluation schemerequires an increase in the annual earnings bill in excess of 3^ per cent, whichcannot be offset by other savings, the data submitted in support of the scheme tothe Department of Employment and Productivity under the early warningarrangements should include:(a) the method of evaluation applied and the detailed constructionof the scheme(b) the job descriptions and specifications(c) the resulting grades and ranks and numbers involved(d) a comparison of existing and proposed rates of pay foreach grade(e) details of the number, cost and estimated trend of personal and job allowances (ii)(f) the methods proposed for maintaining the structure5.    As far as the maintenance of the scheme is concerned, the Board say that,while job evaluation establishes a base structure of pay, there is normallyimposed on this structure a super-structure containing a number of components -e.g. merit payment, payment as part of a payment by result scheme, etc.   unless these other components in pay are controlled the base structure established byjob evaluation may be overwhelmed,,   To take account of possible pressures uponthe structure, it is important to provide from the beginning for procedures for-evaluating new and revised jobs.(i) This suggestion was made in the context of the White Paper on the prices and Incomes Policy for 1968 and 1969 (Cmnd.3590) but it applies equallyin the context of the present White Paper.(ii) Job allowances are additions to job evaluated rates of pay to take accountof changing &quot;market rates&quot; for labour.   Their use is considered inparagraphs 68 to 72 of the Board&apos;s Report on Job Evaluation.
-  3  -6.     For the same purpose of controlling all components in pay, the Boardsuggest that:(a) In all companies a senior manager should he made responsible forpay administration, policies and procedures, and for ensuring that theseare known through the organisation.(b) The same senior manager to have as part of his responsibilities theconduct of regular audits of the job evaluation scheme and pay struotureat intervals of not more than 3 years. (Where payment by result systemsare in operation, they should be audited at the same time - see Appendix 1 .)7.     The Board recommend that the audit should:(i)   plot current base rates and earnings against grades;(ii)   analyse all regrading applications over the relevant period byjustification, type of job and grade;(iii)   examine the percentage distribution of employees between grades andthe reasons for any change;(iv)   examine the current relationship between the relationships definedfrom job evaluation and those employed by other pay components;(v)   check the number and cost of &quot;personal allowances&quot; in each year sincethe implementation of the. scheme to ensure they are decreasing at the projected rate and to assess the feasibility of transfers to higherevaluated jobs for the workers involved;(vi)   check the number, cost and trend of &quot;job allowances&quot;.8.     The Board say that they do not envisage pay increases taking place before a job evaluation structure has actually been installed and they emphasise thatbenefits over time should more than outweigh costs so that some gain may accrue to the consumer.
PAYMENT BY RESULTS SYSTEMS1 .     Attention is drawn to Report No. 65 of the National Board for Prices and incomes on Payment by Results Systems (Cmnd. 3627) from which the following information has been taken.2.     The Board say that payment by results (PBR) may be broadly interpreted to mean any system of wage or salary payment which is related to factors in aworker&apos;s performance other than time spent at his employer&apos;s disposal.   PBRsystems may be adopted for a number of reasons, of which the most general is thatthey are thought to provide an incentive to greater effort or application.   TheBoard draw a distinction between &quot;conventional&quot; PBR systems, including individual or group piecework and incentive bonus schemes, and &quot;alternative&quot; systems to whichthe term &quot;payment by results&quot; is sometimes applied.   The latter includes suchsystems as the several&apos;forms of &quot;measured daywork&quot; and various plant-wide incentiveschemes.   The following relates to conventional systems.3.     The Board say that the important points are that a scheme should provide anauthentic and effective incentive and that it should bo under control.    They suggestgeneral guidelines for assessing the operation of existing PBR systems.k,     A PBR system is working successfully where:(a) the rate of increase of average hourly earnings (excluding overtimeand increases paid under industry-wide agreements or their equivalent in non--federated firms, and excluding also increases demonstrably attributable to increased worker effort) is 1^ per cent or less a year;(b) the proportion of average earnings (excluding overtime) which takes(1 )the form of variable output bonus does not exceed one quarter:;(c) standards of performance are sot by work measurement carried out byadequately trained staff whose consistency in rating is regularly chocked;(1)v /This figure is not meant to be interpreted rigidly.   It would apply ina typical case.1
CONFIDENTIAL

(d) enterprise or industry agreements establish clear ground rules separating the process of pay negotiation from the setting of work standards and ensuring uniformity of practice in respect of the latter;

(e) the "learning curve" or "improvement effect" (1) is taken into account when establishing work standards for new jobs and new workers, or revising them for old jobs;

(f) the differentials between the pay of different occupational groups are determined in detail by job evaluation, or a systematic and comprehensive agreement (or both), and are specified, not merely in terms of basic rates, but of "standard earnings" or the equivalent;

(g) the suitability and administration of the system has undergone a major investigation within the past 3 years.

5. The Board give a second set of guidelines which provides signs of loss of control (a "red light") by which firms can identify their payments systems as urgently needing overhaul;

(a) the rate of increase of average hourly earnings (excluding overtime and increases paid under industry-wide agreements or their equivalent in non-federated firms, and excluding also increases demonstrably attributable to increased Worker effort) exceeds 21/2 per cent a year;

(b) the proportion of average earnings (excluding overtime) which takes the form of variable output bonus is over one-third (2);

(c) the use of work study or measured, work standards is not attempted by management, or is prevented or limited by workers;

(d) all or most prices and times are fixed by bargaining between individuals or small groups of workers and management representatives, and there is no clear separation of the processes of 

standard setting and pay negotiation;

(1) The "learning curve" or "improvement effect" is discussed in paragraphs 45 to 47 of Report No. 65.

(2) This figure is not meant to be interpreted rigidly. It would apply in a typical case.


(e) no account is taken of the &quot;learning curve&quot; or &quot;improvement effect&quot;(l) when establishing work standards for now jobs and new workers, or inrevising them for old jobs;(f) there are obvious anomalies in the pay of different occupationalgroups, and between workers in different departments;(g) the suitability and administration of the system has not been fully investigated within the past 5 years;(h) where the information necessary to establish (a) to (f) is lacking.6.     Where managements find themselves between these positions, they should regard this situation as an &quot;amber light&quot;, indicating that control is beginning to slip and should be prepared to take remedial action if it worsens further.The &quot;learning curve&quot; or &quot;improvement effect&quot; is discussed inparagraphs 45 to 47 Qf Report No. 65.3
* See Section G- of the White PaperCRITERIA FOR PRICE INCREASESPrice increases should take place only where justified in one or more of thefollowing circumstances:-(i) If output per employee cannot be increased sufficiently to allowwages and salaries to increase at a rate consistent with the guidance on incomes without some increase in prices, and no offsetting reductionscan be made in non-labour costs per unit of output or in the returnsought on investment;(ii) if there are unavoidable increases in non-labour costs such asmaterials, fuel, services or marketing costs per unit of output whichcannot be offset by reductions in labour or capital costs per unit of output or in the return sought on investment;(iii) if there are unavoidable increases in capital costs per unit of outputwhich cannot be offset by reductions in non-capital costs per unit of output or in the return sought on investment;(iv) if, after every effort has been made to reduce costs, the enterpriseis unable to secure the capital required to meet home and overseasdemand.
APPENDIX 5CRITERIA FOR PRICE REDUCTIONSPrice reductions are called for:-(i) if output per employee is increasing faster than the rate of increase in wages and salaries which is consistent with the guidance on incomes&apos;1&apos;, and there are no offsetting and. unavoidableincreases in non-labour costs per unit of output;(ii) if the costs of materials, fuel or services per unit of outputare falling and there are no offsetting and unavoidable increases in labour or capital costs per unit of output;(iii)   if capital costs por unit of output; are falling and there areno offsetting and unavoidable increases in non-capital costs per unit of output;(iv)    if profits are based on excessive market power.See Section &amp; of the White Paper.
APPENDIX 6PROCEDURE FOR NOTIFYING CLAIMS AND PROPOSED PAY AND PRICE__INCREASES1 .     The &quot;early warning&quot; system was first described in detail in theWhite Paper, &quot;Prices and Incomes Policy:   An &quot;Early Warning&apos; System&quot;(Cmnd. 2808) .   The following is an up-to-date summary of theprincipal features of the arrangements for notifying claims and proposed pay and price increases to the Government.2.     Any information which the Government receives under these arrangements will be treated as confidential (although references to the National Board for Prices and Incomes and to the body whichreplaces it will be announced publicly as hitherto) .Claims and proposed pay increases3.     The Trades Union Congress operates arrangements whereby theGeneral Council is informed by affiliated unions of all impendingclaims.   The TUC keep the Department of Employment and Productivityinformed of developments in respect of affiliated unions.A-.     Unions and staff associations etc. not affiliated to the TradesUnion Congress notify claims direct to the Department of employment and Productivity.5.     The Confederation of British Industry operates arrangements toprovide the Government with information about claims, formal offers,references to arbitration and terms of settlement reported to it by its members.   So far as national claims and settlements are concerned,the Confederation itself collects the information and passes it on tothe Department of Employment and Productivity.   Information aboutlocal and company negotiations is supplied to the Department directby member firms and employers&apos; organisations.6.     Employers&apos; organisations which are not members of the confederation of British Industry, and firms which are neither membersof the Confederation nor members of member employers&apos; organisationsare expected to supply information about claims, formal offers and terms of settlement direct to the Department of Employment and productivity,,1
7. Similar arrangements exist in the public sector for reporting informa-tion to the Government departments concerned.8.     The information about claims should specify:(i)   the nature and terms of the claim,(ii)   the proposed date of implementation,(iii)    the number and category of workers covered,(iv)   the date and terms of the previous settlement covering this group of workers,and   (v)   an assessment of the justification for the proposed improvementin the light of the guidance given in this White Paper.Similar information should be supplied about proposed settlements.9.     While the guidance given in this   White Paper applies to all settle-ments, the information to be submitted under the early warning arrangementsrelates to claims and proposed settlements which might be significant(e.g. because of the nature of the claim, or the possible repercussions on the pay of other groups) and, in any case,  to all those involving morethan 100 workers.10,   All notifications to the Department of Employment and Productivityshould be addressed to:The   Department of Employment and Productivity,P.G.P.A.2,8 St. James&apos;s Square,London, S.W.1.Proposed price increases11.   The goods and services to which the early warning arrangementscurrently apply are listed in Part A of Appendix 8.12.
