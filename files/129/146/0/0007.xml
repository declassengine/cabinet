M1:;public expenditure, in 1972-73 and 1973-74-32.   The Government have not yet taken decisions on the levels for individual programmes in 1972-73 and 1973-74, but they are planningon the basis that the total of public expenditure will grow broadlyin line with the forecast growth of the economy as a whole.   Intable 1.6 below there are shown provisional allocations among the programmes of a total of public expenditure which rises by about-g- pei&quot; cent in both years.   Decisions on the programmes will bemade in due course by the Government at the time and will be laidbefore Parliament,33o   All the figures in table 1.6 are provisional, and the margins of estimation vary from one programme to another.    The allocationmade to the Defence Budget on this basis of  2,070 million in1972-73 is simply carried forward at the same level for 1973-74.For Overseas Aid, as further steps towards the TOOT AD target (10)the Government have announced a programme totalling  270 millionlor 1972-73 mid  305 million for 1973-74.    For a number of programmes information is necessarily incomplete at this stage:the Technological Services programme will not be settled untilmuch nearer the time because new technological projects may come forward in the meantime which should be considered for places inthe programme.    The amounts to be spent on other assistance to employment and industry will be affected by the course of private investment attracting investment grants;   and decisions affectingsupport for agriculture will be taken in successive annual ParmPrice Reviews.   Environmental and social services, except social security, involve large expenditures by local authorities whoseown decisions may affect the amounts to be spent and theirdistribution between programmes.    The course of expenditure on social security will be mainly determined by the extent ofupratings./PUBLICSee 2.3, paragraph 4
