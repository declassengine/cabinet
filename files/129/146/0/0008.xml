CONFIDENTIAL-FINAL REVISE[to be published as Command 4234 by her Majesty &apos;s Stationery Office8s. 6d. [42hp.] net]Public Expenditure1968-69 to 1973-74

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: 1968-69 to 1973-74FOREWORDIn April this year the Government proposed that &quot;there should be pub-lished towards the end of each calendar year a White Paper which will present to Parliament the results of the Government^ consideration of theprospect for public expenditure&quot; (Cmnd. 4017, paragraph 5).This proposal was welcomed by the Select Committee on Procedure intheir Report on the Scrutiny of Public Expenditure and Administration (H.C.410). In the debate on this Report on 21 October the Government announced their intention to produce the first White Paper in the new series in the nearfuture, and this was foreshadowed also in the Queen&apos;s Speech. The presentWhite Paper fulfils this intention.December, 1969

PART public EXPENDITURE-THE GENERAL PROSPECTIntroduction1. This White Paper sets out the Governments plans for public expen-diture for the current financial year 1969-70 and for the next two years. it also gives allocations of expenditure on a provisional and approximate basis for the two subsequent years, 1972-73 and 1973-74, for which the Governmenthave not yet token decisions. These plans and allocations give expression tothe Governmenfs policy that expenditure on public services shall expandthroughout the period broadly in line with the growth of the nation&apos;s resourcesas a whole.2. Public expenditure is a generic term for a large number of pro-grammes and services administered by individual departments, local authori-ties, nationalised industries, and other public corporations and agencies, allfinanced in varying degrees by the Government and subject in varying waysto central influence or control. At any one time it reflects the results of acomplex of decisions, some stretching back several years, the effects of whichwill often be felt for many years to come. Basic reviews of policy are madein particular programmes from time to time. But most of the decisions whichthe Government take on public expenditure from year to year are directed to the questions: what modifications should be made to existing pro-grammes? How much provision should be made for new policies or fordevelopments of existing programmes? What is the sensible allowance toinclude for further developments of policy, or to meet unexpected turns ofevents?3. In making their plans and carrying them out the Government haveto take account of changing circumstances at home and abroad. They also have to allow for special features of the programmes themselves. For someprogrammes, expenditure depends in part on Government decisions but inpart also on what happens beyond the reach of government. Examples aresickness benefit, Where tlhe Government decides the rate of benefit but the occurrence of sickness determines whether benefit as paid; or investment grants, where tlhe rate of grant is decided by the Government but its paymentdepends on the amount of investment done by industry. In other cases a probable call for additional spending can foe foreseen, but not the precisetiming and scale of that expenditure for example, support for future, as yet unformulated, technological projects. Then, for nearly 30 per cent oftotal public expenditure, local authorities, with their own degree of autonomy, share responsibility with the Government; broadly, their capitalexpenditure which is financed by borrowing requires central sanction, butthey have power to decide how much current expenditure to incur, in thelight of the guidance which the Government are able to give on the standards of services and on the relative priorities between services and of the volumeof Government funds available to them in support of their own revenue(see Appendix I).4. For all these reasons any forward plans for public expenditure as awhole need to be flexible, and the figures in which plans are expressed atany one time should be interpreted with this in mind. The next sections ofthis paper briefly trace how expenditure has moved in recent years, andthen set out the future prospects.

7. Between 1964-65 and 1968-69 the Governments new defence policiesbrought about a fall in defence expenditure in real terms. In the civil sector,regional development policy was combined with measures to modernise andrestructure industry, and with expenditure on other items under this heading,including scientific and technological research and other measures in supportof industry and employment, this became tihe fastest rising group of pro-grammes 9.0(&quot;) iper cent per annum. Priority was also given to tihe social services on which expenditure was increased by an average annual rate over-all of 6.0 per cent, including 4.9 per cent on education, 3.9 per cent on healthanil welfare and 8.3 per cent on social security.8. Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure rose at an average of 2. per cent a year overall. Capital expenditure by the electricity industry turneddownwards towards the end of the period; investment by the coal industrycontinued to decrease.9. The net effect of all these movements was to produce an average annual increase in total public expenditure between 1964-65 and 1968-69 of5.9 per cent (including the relative price effectO), with expenditure on defencebeginning to fall and civil expenditure, particularly on tihe social and econo-mic services, rising faster than before.Prospective growlh of resources10. Over the past decade a rising labour force contributed about i percent a year to the increase in total output (which at constant 1963 pricesaveraged just under 3 per cent a year), the balance coming from increased productivity.11. During the next few years, little change is expected in the size of theworking population, but in 1973 and 1974 the raising of the school-leaving age will reduce the numbers of young people joining the work force. Thusrising output can only come from rising productivity. It seems that illlieunderlying rate of increase in productivity is now about 3 per cent a year or alittle less.12. &quot;The Task Ahead&quot; envisaged an increase of total output within a range of just under 3 per cent to about 4 per cent it year. In settling the levels of public expenditure over the next few years, the Government have basedtheir decisions on the assumption that the rate of growth of the wtfion&apos;resources will be at the tower end of this range. They have made this assumption because they consider it wise to take a cautious view of theresources available. Despite the marked recent improvement in the country&apos;overseas earnings, there remains the overriding need lo make -available asufficient share of these growing resources for maintaining tin adequate stir-plus on the balance of payments and a higher level of private investment.But if experience were to show that a higher rale of growth could be achieved at the same lime as the other objectives of the Governments economic policies, then it would become a matter for decision how far this additional(2) The rates of increase given for particular programmes do not. lake account ofthe relative price effect. This is included in the rales of increase given for public sector expenditure as a whole and accounts for about 3 per cent per annum spread over the programmes other than 4lie capital investment of the nationalised industries, etc., anddebt interest.(&apos;&apos;) See footnote (ii) to Table 1.1.
output should be used to expand public expenditure programmes or in other-ways.The general prospect for public expenditure up to 1971-7213. The prospect for public expenditure and receipts up to 1971-72 is summarised in Table 1.2(*). The figures are here presented in the newway explained in the Governments Green Paper of April, 1969(5).14. The movement of total public expenditure is shown in line 14. Therates of increase between one year and the next from 1968-69 to 1971-72are 2.4 per cent, 3.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively an averageof 3.0 per cent for this period as a whole.15. The Government have in the past published limits(6) against whichall public expenditure was to be counted except the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries and debt interest, though without adjustment for therelative price effect. Expressed at 1969 Survey prices these limits have been:  million1968-69 1969-70 1970-7116,098 16,252 16,757The corresponding totals in this White Paper are within these limits(7), asfollows:  million1968-69 1969-70 1970-7115,822 (provisional 16,214 (estimate)     16,722 (estimate)outturn)(*) Detailed analyses of the figures in Table 1.2 are given on pages 21 to 28 in Tables1.7-1.10 for each of the years 1968-69 to 1971-72, distinguishing expenditure, and receiptsalso, so far as this is relevant.CO &quot;Public Expenditure: A New Presentation&quot; (Cmnd. 4017).(&quot;) &quot;Public Expenditure in 1968-69 and 1969-70&quot; (Cmnd. 3515) and &quot;public expenditure 1968-69 to 1970-71 &quot; (Cmnd. 3936).C) The composition of these totals is explained in Appendix III, paragraphs 16 and 17.

The programmes in 1968-69 were well within the target to some extentbecause expenditure provided for in the year was not actually met until thefollowing year. Mainly for this reason the actual increases in these aggregates,- which exclude the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries, etc., anddebt interest, between 1967-68 and 1969-70 are now estimated at about 2\ percent in each year, and between 1969-70 and 1970-71 at about 3j per cent.Detailed comparisons between the programme estimates for 1969-70 anil1970-71 given in the White Paper &quot;Public Expenditure 1968-69 to 1970-71 &quot;(Cmnd. 3936) of last February and in this White Paper are shown in appendix ii.16. In Table 1.2 expenditure and receipts are classified under three main headings Resources; Transfers, taxations etc.; and Assets. The distributionof the contingency reserve, by its nature, cannot be forecast. It has beenarbitrarily included as a whole under Resources since its implications fordemand would lie greatest if it were all required for purchases of resources;but some of it might in the event be required for expenditure on either of theother classes.17. Net expenditure on resources, which is the class having the most powerful effect on demand, is shown in line 3 to rise by 4 per cent per annum.Of this, about 4- par cent is attributable to the contingency reserve and 1$per cent to the relative price effect. Net expenditure on assets, the cate-gory which has the least impact on demand in the short term, is shown in line tl to rise at an annual rate of a little over 1 per cent; but this is asmall element in the total. Expenditure on transfers is shown in lines 4 and5 as rising by about 1 j per cent a year; but the figures will be affected by whatever decisions are eventually taken on the u prating of social security benefits in the period (see section 17 of Part 2 on social security).18. The receipts side of the table, unlike the expenditure side, showsprojections which do not represent explicit Government decisions. Changesin tax rates are among the main instruments for the short-term regulationof the economy; there may have to foe modifications in the light of the situation as it develops from year to year and the Government cannot commit them-selves in advance. The projections of receipts are therefore based on certain assumptions. These may not in the event be realised; hut they indicate the trend as it would be if no further changes were made in the system. thus the yield of Government taxes has been calculated on the assumptions that present tax rates and allowances will continue unchanged and that the.gross national product will grow as postulated. Changes in tax rates which weremade in the Budgets of 1968 and 1969 are, of course, allowed for. national insurance contributions are projected to rise so as to match, together with theExchequer supplement, the assumed growth of expenditure on benefits. Simi-larly, projections of income from local rates are related to projections of Iheexpenditure of local authorities and assume that the existing system of grants to those authorities continues.19. The average annual increase in total receipts over the period isestimated on these- assumptions at 3\ per cent. There is a large increase,of 9^ per cent, in the yield of taxes between 1968-69 and 1969-70, shownin line 6; this results partly from budgetary changes which have already takenplace and partly from the growth of the economy. In the following year Iherate of increase still owes something to recent changes in lax rates. The
change between 1970-7.1 and 1971-72 is put at about 3 per cent; this increase is not significantly influenced by past changes in tax rates.20. iLine 15 shows the balance between total receipts and total expendi-ture. Iu tlie current financial year the public sector as a whole is forecast tohave a surplus of receipts over expenditure of over  500 million. In the past the public sector has normally had a deficit financed by borrowing. Thechange from a public sector deficit in 1968-69 to a sizeable surplus in1969-70 has played an important part in creating the financial conditionsnecessary for achieving a surplus on the balance of payments. The prospectis that at existing tax rates total receipts and total expenditure will he roughlyin balance during the following two years.21. A second balance is struck in line 10 by excluding transactions inassets (line 13) from total receipts and total expenditure. Movements in this second balance the balance of resources, transfers, taxation, week. const i-tute a better guide than the balance of total receipts and total expenditure tothe impact of public sector operations on real demand in the short term.This balance, too, shows a large favourable swing between last year and thecurrent year. This improvement in the balance of public sector transactions(other than in assets) has contributed to the switch of resources into (he balanceof payments which has already taken place. Its maintenance over the comingperiod will help to consolidate the improvement in our overseas position and toset lice resources for a further increase in private investment.The prospect lor public expenditure programmes up to 1971-7222. The plans for public expenditure programmes up lo 1971-72 show a continuation of the same broad pattern as has been developing over recentyears. The real cost of defence will continue to fall as changes in defence policytake effect. At the same time the Government are planning for an increase incivil programmes. Environmental and social services increase from 61 per cent of total public expenditure in 1968-69 to 64 per cent in 1971-72. But Ihesedevelopments are planned within a total of public expenditure which will be growing at an average annual rate of 3 per cent, compared with 5.9 per cent over the last four years.

Allowance ismade for some reduction in the total volume of debt, and for the refunding of currentdebt.24. The detail lying behind this summary is set out in table 1.4,which distinguishes 20 main programmes, most of which comprise a largenumber of individual projects or services. This classification brings togetherexpenditure of the various spending authorities Government, local authoritiesand public corporations other than nationalised industries which is directed to single broad objectives, e.g., education and housing. The public expenditureof Northern Ireland and the capital expenditure oi nationalised industries arcbrought together under single headings, and so is debt interest. Part 2 of this white Paper provides a commentary on each of the programmes.25. The contingency reserve, shown in this table in line 25, makes pro-vision for new expenditure which may have to be incurred but the precisenature, scale and timing of which cannot be foreseen. It is also needed to cover any excess over present estimates, in particular for programmes where expendi-ture is partly determined by factors not under the spending authority&apos;s owncontrol, and to provide an element of flexibility should the economy notdevelop as is assumed in the plans. Since these uncertainties increase overtime, provision has been made on an increasing scale.

An analysis of the programmes by spending authority is given for eachof the four years in Tables 3.1-3.4 on pages 64 to 67. These tables distinguishthose elements of expenditure to be incurred by the Government (showingVote-financed expenditure separately from that financed from the national insurance Funds and other funds), by local authorities, and by public corporations, inoluding, in addition to the nationalised industries, the broad-casting authorities, the new town corporations, and a number of otherindividual bodies.

The growth of current expenditure by the Government is mainly in social security (partly because of recent increases in benefit, partly becauseof increased numbers), the National Health Service, and the universities; andthe growth in capital expenditure mainly in roads and transport, investment grants, hospitals, offices, computer centres and other Government buildings,and lending under the overseas aid programme.29. Local authorities are responsible for the greater part of expenditure,current and capital, on. local environmental! services (96 per cent), law andorder (81 per cent), and housing (79 per cent) that is, in nearly all. the main programmes in the environmental services group which, with an average annual rate of increase of 4.7 per cent (see Table 1.3), is the major groupplanned to grow most rapidly in the period. Within the social services group,local authorities have the major part of expenditure in education (84 pet-cent). These various services, together with roads, are also individually thelargest to be run by local authorities. Together they account for over 90 percent of local authorities&apos; expenditure, 40 per cent of it going on educationalone.30. The figures quoted in Table 1.5 for the current expenditure of localauthorities differ from the figures of relevant expenditure on which rate support grant is paid in Great Britain in that the former include some items(8) The aggregates of public expenditure and the individual programmes for eachyear 1968-69 to 1971-72 are analysed in detail by economic category in tables 3.5 and 3.6on pages 69 to 72.
(mainly rate fund contributions to council bouse rents) which do not come within &quot;relevant expenditure&quot;, but exclude loan charges and some other items which do: moreover Table 1.5 covers Northern Ireland, which is outsidethe Great Britain rate support grant settlements. The total of Great Britainrelevant expenditure to attract irate support grant in 1969-70 and 1970-71 was determined last winter. For 1971-72 the elements of local authority relevant expenditure (other than loan charges) which are included in the programmesimply, when brought together, a growth of 4 per cent in ireal terms above thetotal which was accepted for 1970-71 under the 1968 irate support grant settlc-mentp). This is the rate of increase which the Government will regard as an acceptable basis for the next rate support grant determination; and theyconsider that the resources available to local authorities after such a deler-mination will enable them to achieve the programmes which are embodied inthis White Paper, including as the largest among them the educationprogra mmc.31. Capital expenditure by the nationalised industries reflects the chang-retraining pattern of demand for the output of the industries concerned. The fastestrising (and soon the biggest) individual programme is that of the Post Office, tomeet the rapid increase in demand for telecommunications services. The capitalexpenditure of the industries as a whole is expected lo fall slightly between1968-69 and 1971-72 as a result of a substantial reduction in capital expendi-tlire by the electricity industry, which will more than offset rising expenditure by other industries.Public expenditure in 1972-73 and 1973-7432 The Government have not yet taken decisions on the levels for indi-vidual programmes in 1972-73 and 1973-74, but they arc planning on thebasis that the total of public expenditure will grow broadly in line with the forecast growth of the economy as a whole. In table 1.6 there are shown provisional allocations among the programmes of a total of public expenditure which rises by about 34 per cent in both years. Decisions on the programmes will be made in due course by the Government at Ihe lime andwill be laid before Parliament.33. All the figures in table 1.6 are provisional, and the margins of csli-mation vary from one programme to another. The allocation made lo (heDefence Budget on this basis of  2,070 million in 1972-73 is simply carried -Tor-ward at Ihe same level for 1973-74. For Overseas Aid, as further steps towardsthe UNCTAD target (&apos;&quot;), the Government have announced a programme total-ling  270 million for 1972-73 and  305 million for 1973-74. For a numberof programmes information is necessarily incomplete at this stage: the Tech-nological Services programme cannot be sctlled until much nearer the limebecause new technological projects may come forward in the meanwhilewhich should be considered for places in the programme. The amountsto be spent on other assistance to employment and industry will be affected bythe course of private investment attracting investment grants; and decisions affecting support for agriculture will be taken in successive annual FarmO For an explanation of Hie financial arrangements between the Government andlocal authorities sec Appendix I.(&apos;&quot;) Sec 23, paragraph 4.
Price Reviews. Environmental and social services, except social security,involve large expenditures by local authorities whose own decisions may affect the amounts to be spent and their distribution between programmes.The course of expenditure on social security will be mainly determined by theextent of upratings.PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY PROGRAMME:PROVISIONAL ALLOCATION, 1972-73 AND 1973-74  (i)TABLE 1.6   million	1972-73	1973-74	provisional	provisional	allocation (i)	allocation (i)At 1969 Survey prices		Defence and external relations		1.

Renewed growth in capital expenditure by the nationalised industries is likely in 1972-73 and 1973-74 following four years in which there willhave been ilittle change in the total of this expenditure. In a number of programmes, for instance telecommunications, there will be continuingincreases, and the level of capital expenditure by the electricity industry will begin to rise again.
35. Decisions on the pattern of expenditure in 1972-73 will be taken innext. year&apos;s annual review and embodied in the White Paper for that year.At that time provisional allocations will again he made for 1973-74, and fora further year .1974-75. As the programmes arc rolled forward in this wayeach year, and as calls are made on the contingency reserve, changes are tobe expected in liie individual totals.

PART 2: THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMESPart I of this White Paper was concerned with the general prospect for public expenditure.

The savings in defence expenditure which will be achieved in consequence will not attaintheir full extent until 1972-73, but the targets which have now been sel forthe earlier years 1070-71 and 1971-72 reflect continuous efforts to ensurethai Ihe new defence policy is carried out in the most efficient and econo-mical manner possible. Thus it has been found possible to reduce expend!lure al a quicker rate than was envisaged in January 1968 when the currentpolicy was announced (Cmnd, 3515). In particular the target for the DefenceItiulget in 1970-71 is i&apos;76 million less than the estimate made in February1969 (Cmnd, 3936), Detailed information about the Defence Budget for&apos;)7()-7i and developments in defence plans will be reported to Parliament inthe l&apos;)7() Statement on Defence Estimates,OTHER MILITARY defence i millionTABLJB 2,2 ai 1969 Survey prices	1968- 69	1969 70	1970 71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			Ui) Military aid    ......	14-5	8-9	4-7	30(/&apos;) AIUpiI services	790	81-1	81-9	79-5(V) United States military aircraft				(i) Purchases	110 6	38-5	320	4-3(ii) Repayments              ,,	- 47-3	43-1	-52-5	54-7(J) Oilier (i)        ......	 10-5	0-5	-06	-4-5Total    ......	146-3	85-2	65-5	27-6(i) This includes provision lor national accounting adjustments and certain minor items,

I, Since 1967-68 there has been a basic aid programme of  205 million a year in cash terms (i.e. without adjustment for changes in money values)covering normal multilateral and bilateral aid and technical assistance. some special items of aid expenditure have been undertaken separately in addi-tion to this programme.2. Within the basic programme multilateral aid consists of contributions to the International Development Association, the United Nations Develop-ment Programme and other institutions such as the United Nations Children&apos;sFund, the World Food Programme and the Regional Development Banksfor Asia, Africa and Latin America. Bilateral aid by way of grants and loansgoes mainly to Commonwealth countries and takes a variety of forms in-cluding aid for development projects, assistance towards a general import programme, balance of payments support (sometimes including debt relief)and, for a few countries and on a declining scale, budgetary aid to maintainminimum services. Technical assistance is given to a great many developing countries in the form of skilled people to fill executive and advisory appoint-menls, and also by way of consultancies and research and training in theUnited Kingdom and overseas. As opportunity offers Government policy isto increase the proportion of aid given multilalcrally and in the form of tech-nical assistance. For 1970-71 planned expenditure within the basic aid pro-gramme is as follows:Bilateral grants and loansCommonwealth and Dependencies  102 millionForeign  12 millionMultilateral contributions  30 millionTechnical assistance  40 millionCommonwealth Development Corporation  11 millionContingency reserve  10 million the figures shown above for the Commonwealth Development Corporationrepresent gross advances by tlie Ministry of Overseas Development. an adjustment, which may be positive or negative, is made (see line (f) in Table2.3) to take account of the Corporation^ net investment with other funds andthus to show the effect of its transactions as a whole on United Kingdomresources.3. Of the special items additional to the basic a-id programme thelargest is the  75 million of economic aid to Singapore and Malaysia which isbeing provided over five years from 1968-69 to mitigate the effects of theUnited Kingdom military withdrawal. There is also provision for an extra  7 million annually for three years ending in 1971-72 towards the increased UnitedKingdom contribution to the Second Replenishment of the hinds of the inter--national Development Association, and three annual contributions of  million from 1968 under the Rome Food Aid Convention.4. In 1968 the Government joined with the governments of other western countries who provide aid in accepting a recommendation of the SecondUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) thatdeveloped countries should endeavour lo reach a target of 1 per cent of gross national product at market prices for financial flows to developing countriescomprising Governmental aid, private investment and guaranteed export credits, all net of capital repayments. No date for implementation was given
and die United Kingdom\s acceptance of the recommendation was subject to balance of payments considerations. All of the present overseas aid expenditurecounts towards itJic target except that part of lihe special aid to Singapore and malaysia which may be used to purchase defence equipment.5. The basic programme of 1205 million a year and the additional itemswill continue in 1969-70 anil 1970-71, producing total aid expenditure of 226.9 million and  2.15.1 million in cash ilernis in ilihese years, of which 219.4 million and  227.6 million (gross) is expected lo count towards (lieUNCTAD target. Tor 1971-72, in order to make a move Howards that target,the Government ihave decided lo increase gross aid expenditure countingtowards it to  245 million in cash terms, and total aid expenditure accordingly to  251 million. Prom that year aid expenditure will be treated as one comprc-hensive programme, providing for all items of development assistance.OTHER OVERSEAS SERVICESf, million table 2.4 at 1969 Survey prices	1968 6&apos;) provisional outturn	1969 70 estimate	1970 71 estimate	1971 72 estimateOverseas representation	60-0	61-2	61 -4	62-&apos;)Overseas information	28-3	30-7	30-2	29-other external relations	39-5	35-3	32-4	32-7Total......	127-8	127-2	124-0	125-2I.

Some general provision tlms also beenmade for now projects.(,&apos;oveiiiiiienl research mid development2. The industrial research establishments work for Government depart-meats, for other public authorities and in support of industry. The total nelexpenditure of the nuilli-purpose establishments (the National Physical Lab-oratory, Nationail Engineering I .abora lory and Warren Spring Laboratory) isexpected to remain al its present level. A small increase may be expected atthe other, more specialised, establishments to meet growing demands upon
them. All the establishments are being encouraged lo alter the balance of workin favour of those programmes which sue directly related lo specific needs in industry, particularly work on repayment. A proportion of the cost of theMinistry&apos;s aviation research and development establishments and of aerospaceresearch in industry is allocated to this heading because of the value of this work to civil industry. Total nel expenditure on civil research and devolop-ment by the Atomic llnergy Authority will gradually decline. Within this total, more work is being done at the Authority^ establishments in supportof non-nuclear industry. Within the nuclear field the main emphasis is now on the fast reactor.Direct support tor industrial technology3. Increasing provision is planned for support of the engineering indust-ries and for productivity and information services, which benefit a wide range of industries. The work of the National Research Development corporation on the exploitation of inventions made in Government eslablish-nients and by the Research Councils, and in helping lo finance research anddevelopment projects in industry, will be fully maintained. A ceiling has beenplaced on the total of grants to the industrial research associations; ndjust-incnts of annual grants to individual associations tire being made within thetotal in accordance with the priority of their needs as grant agreements come up for reassessment.Category II4.

The estimates for the Redundancy Fund from 1969-70 onwards take into account the effect of the Redundancy Rebates Act 1969 in reducing therebates payable to employers from the Fund.Promotion of local employment. Expenditure on the promotion of local employment consists of loans and grants by the Ministry of Technology to firms which provide additionalTABLE 2.6 at 1969 Survey prices
employment in the development areas, and the cost of the building of fac-tories and development of industrial estates by the Ministry of Technologyitself. Gross expenditure in 1969-70 is expected to be  17.4 million higherthan in 1968-69. The demand for loan finance and (to a smaller extent) thenumber of large projects going to the development areas have both increased.Expenditure will continue to rise, largely as a result of the Governmenfsdecisions on -assistance to the intermediate areas, but the increase will be tosome extent offset by increasing receipts from rents and sales.Industrial Reorganisation Corporation4. The functions of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) areto promote industrial reorganisation and development in the general interestof the economy. Its main sources of capital are loans from the National loans fund and Public Dividend Capital from a Vote of the Ministry of Technology;the Corporation pays interest on the former, and is to make periodic payments of dividend on the latter. The Corporation has made a first dividend pay-ment of  750,000 gross for 1968-69.5. Under the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation Act 1966, a limit of 150 million was set to the aggregate of the public funds available to the 1958-59.The nature of the IRCs operations, which include support for industrialmergers, the outcome of which depends on the course of commercial nego-tiations, makes it difficult to programme its expenditure in advance. In the longer run, the Corporation is expected to rely heavily on revolving its existing capital as a means of re-financing itself, but it will take some years to build upannual repayments.6. For these reasons, the estimates in Table 2.6 of the annual phasing of lending by the 1958-59 are tentative. They show the final  18 million of the 150 million made available by the Government under existing legislation asbeing lent in 1971-72. The Table does not anticipate future legislation byshowing any lending in excess of the  150 million. But the Government intend to enable the 1958-59 to maintain approximately its current level of operationsbeyond that date, and to introduce legislation in due course to increase theexisting limit of  150 million. Decisions on the timing of the legislation, onthe increase in the limit and on the phasing of drawings against the new limitwill be taken nearer the time, in the light of the actual course of the IRCsfinancial operations. Any expenditure beyond the present  150 million ceilingwill be a claim on the contingency reserve.Other specific grants and loans to industry7. This heading covers Board of Trade services on the promotion oftrade and exports, including expenditure by the Tourist Boards set up underthe Development of Tourism Act 1969; expenditure on the new hotel loans and grants scheme (which is expected to rise to a peak of about  8.5 million in 1971-72); grants to the British National Export Council; expenditure on trade fairs; and loans by the National Film Finance Corporation. It also includes loans of  31.1 million over the years 1969 to 1971 to the aluminiumsmelting companies, for which the Ministry of Technology is now responsible.Investment grants8. The figures for investment grants assume that payment in each year will be in respect of four quarters&apos; investment expenditure, and that the
standard rate of grant will remain at 20 per cent, and the development arearate at 40 per cent. The figures take account of the latest evidence on the trend in capital investment by industry, the proportion of it that will be eligible for investment grant, and the proportion of it that will attract thehigher development area rate of grant. Forecasts of this expenditure havebeen unavoidably uncertain as it depends not only on the way in which these factors develop, but also on the timing of applications for grant. It is now clear that substantial additional grant expenditure will be required in 1969-70,as compared with previous estimates, and the present figure for that yearincluded in Table 2.6 allows for the further provision which, pending a finalappraisal, will be proposed in a Winter Supplementary Estimate.9. It is also clear that some of these factors will require a higher levelof grant expenditure than had previously been forecast in 1970-71 and 1971-72 also. One factor in this revision of estimates is the experience gained asto the proportion of industrial investment which is eligible for grant at thenational and Development Area rates of grant under the terms of the scheme.Another is the higher rate of growth in certain categories of capital expendi-ture. Allowance has now been made for these factors in the figures for 1970-71and 1971-72, though the revised forecasts remain subject to variation.10. While the growth in productive investment which the grant schemewas designed to stimulate is to be welcomed, this additional grant expendi-ture has entailed a substantial charge on the contingency reserve, which mustmilitate strongly against further measures to increase or accelerate the flow of grant payments to industry in present circumstances. In the longer termaccount will have to be taken of current studies on the relative cost effective-ness of the scheme.SET additional payments and regional employment premiums11. The bulk of additional payments under the selective employment tax (SET) arrangements and regional employment premiums are paid by theDepartment of Employment and Productivity to qualifying private employers in the development areas. A relatively small amount is paid by other Depart-ments to nationalised industries in respect of those parts of their undertakings which qualify in the development areas. SET additional payments are beingabolished with effect from 1 April 1970 but because payment is made inarrears some provision is necessary in 1970-71 and, for belated claims, again in 1971-72. The regional employment premium will continue to be paid.Board of Trade and Ministry of Technology services12. The administrative expenses of the Board of Trade on their services to industry and trade, and those of the Ministry of Technology on investment grants, promotion of local employment and some other services, come underthis heading.Assistance to coal industry.13. Under the Coal Industry Act 1967 measures to alleviate social hard-ship are due to end in March 1971, although some expenditure will spillover into 1972 and 1973. It was announced in the Queen&apos;s Speech that a bill will be introduced to continue after March 1971 the Governments powers under the 1967 Act. The estimate of  18.8 million for 1971-72 in Table 2.6takes account of this new commitment.

The Councils are responsible for encouraging and supporting funda-mental and applied research in their own establishments, in units which theysupport at universities, and by bodies to which they make grants. They sup-port university research by grants to research workers and by awards to post-graduates for research training and for advanced courses in science and tech-nology. Grants for scientific purposes, including international fellowships,are given to the Royal Society and to the Royal Society, Edinburgh.3. The science budget also covers subscriptions to international scientificbodies. In 1969-70 these amount to  12.2 million. The Science Research Coun-cil is responsible for United Kingdom contributions to the European SpaceTABLE 2.7 at 1969 Survey prices
Research Organisation (ESRO), the European Organisation for Nuclear Re-search (CERN) and to the NATO Scientific Research and Training Pro-gramme; the Medical Research Council for the contribution to the Inter-national Agency for Research on Cancer; and the Department of education and Science for that to the European Molecular Biology Conference.4. The main fields of research covered by the Councils are plants, ani-mals, food and agricultural engineering (ARC); biological, clinical and tropi-cal medicine research (MRC); geology, hydrology, oceanography, marine bio-logy, fisheries and conservation (NERC); astronomy, space and radio, nuclearphysics, engineering, chemistry and sciences not covered by the other Coun-cils (SRC). The Council for Scientific Policy and the individual Councils have encouraged research which brings economic benefit, though this is seldomimmediate; for example, research relating to animals and crops; minerals;and polymers and enzymes.5. Within the field of agricultural research a number of Institutes inScotland are financed separately on Scottish votes although their programmes of research are co-ordinated with the Agricultural Research Council.6. The Social Science Research Council, which receives its funds afterdirect negotiation with the Department of Education and Science, supportsresearch in economic and social matters including management and industrial relations, statistics, psychology and social administration.AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FORESTRY  million table 2.8__at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimateAgricultural support Other assistance to agriculture Fisheries Forestry	263-7 51-8 8-8 36-5	317-0 54-3 10-2 39-2	326-0 53-2 10-5 42-5	327-0 59-5 10-2 45-1..

Table 2.8 above covers most of the expenditure of the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the Department of Agricul-ture and Fisheries for Scotland (DAFS) along with that of the Forestry Com-mission and some minor items of other Departments and local authorities.Agricultural support2. This expenditure covers the implementation of the price guarantees,the provision of grants and subsidies to farmers, and the associated admini-strative costs. There are special difficulties about forecasting the future costof agricultural support. The levels of the guarantees and subsidies will beaffected by changes made at future Farm Price Reviews. But, even if therewere no changes in guaranteed prices, the cost of implementing the guaranteeswould be liable to marked variations according to the levels of supply and of
market prices. The figures for agricultural support have therefore been pre-pared on the following conventional basis, and do not attempt to predict futurevariations.3. The figures for 1969-70 correspond to the Estimates for the year as submitted to Parliament before the 1969 Price Review, adjusted to take account of the estimated effect of that Review in that financial year. Thefigures for 1970-71 and subsequent years take account of the estimated full-year effects of the 1969 Price Review but, in most other respects, project anunchanged figure for agricultural support. In practice, the cost of agricultural support may result in higher or lower expenditure tihan the figures in Table2.8, depending on the factors described above.Other assistance to agriculture4. This includes the bulk of the remainder of the expenditure of MAFFand DAFS on agricultural and horticultural services, and administrative costs;it includes the advisory services. Here again, as with agricultural support,some expenditure has been estimated on a conventional basis with no attemptto predict future variations, e.g. stabilising payments to the bacon curingindustry, animal disease compensation, payments under the Anglo-Irish free trade Agreement. The increase over the forecast period is due mainly to thedevelopment of policies under the Agriculture Act 1967 in respect of farmamalgamations and rural development policy, and to the modernisation of wholesale horticultural markets.Fisheries5. This estimate reflects the higher level of support for the industryauthorised by the Sea Fisheries Act 1968. The amount of support provided from year to year cannot, however, be forecast with accuracy because it depends on operating results and in the case of the inshore fleet on decisions taken by Ministers in an annual review. As part of the Governments supportpolicy for the industry provision has also been made for a higher level ofexpenditure on grants and loans for vessels and equipment.Forestry6. The estimate covers support for private and state forestry. The period will see an expansion in the Forestry Commission^ planting programme,particularly in Scotland.

All other expenditure (including maintenance andlighting of principal and non-principal roads, as well as improvement of non-principal roads) is a local responsibility.2. The number of vehicles using the roads continues to rise by about 5 percent every year and it is estimated that by the end of 1971-72 nearly half the5,400 miles of trunk roads will be very heavily loaded. Urban traffic is alsosteadily increasing. These factors call for an expanding programme of roadexpenditure.3. Continuing improvements to routes which carry the bulk of the traffic and the relief of urban congestion are essential to promote the economic and social well-being not only of the individual regions but of the country as awhole.4. The planning, design and construction of major road schemes can takeseven years or more so that decisions on policy are of a long-term nature.Current land use and transportation studies will establish the framework for future public investment in urban road and traffic management schemes. the green Paper &quot; Roads for the Future,&quot; published in March 1969, with its new approach to inter-urban road planning, seeks to establish guidelines into the1980s. Similarly, in Scotland and Wales future plans have been drawn up afterTABLE 2.9 at 1969 Survey prices
consultation with the interests affected, giving emphasis to the importance of roads in promoting regional development see &quot; The Scottish Economy,1965-70&quot; (Cmnd. 2864), &quot; Scottish Roads in the 1970s&quot; (Cmnd. 3953), and&quot; Wales, The Way Ahead &quot; (Cmnd. 3334).5. Other expenditure includes provision for research and development which will reflect the expansion of work on road building and the greater emphasis being put on road traffic and transportation. More use will be madeof extra-mural research contracts particularly with industry.6. Local authority expenditure on improvement and maintenance of roads, lighting and car-parks is expected to rise slightly as a result of some relaxation of the restrictions imposed in 1968-69 and 1969-70. This expenditure is assisted through the rate support grant but is not directly subject to central control.TRANSPORT    -  million table 2.10 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimateMinistry  of Transport,   Scottish				Development   Department   and				Welsh Office:				Support to nationalised industries	145-0	119-6	86-9	79-other surface transport				Ports    ..      . .	31-1	-a.: 36-1	40-3	40-2Bus fuel grants......	101	20-4	21-4	21-new bus grants	1-7	5-2	8-4	8-4Rural bus and ferry grants   ..	 	0-4	1-2	2-3Infrastructure expenditure	5-5	:   8-3	12-2	24-other passenger transport	12-0   ,	13-6	29-1	24-miscellaneous transport				services	5-9	4-3	6-7	7-8Departmental administration..	10-1	11-2	11-4	11-8Total   ..      ..	76-4 &apos;.&quot;	. 99-5	130-7	140-8Board of Trade:				Civil aviation services	23-2	25-8	30-4	3J-3Shipping services	61	-2-5	-4-4	-4-3Grand total	, 250-7   .	242-4	243-6	247-21. Table 2.10 covers the main elements of Transport expenditure exclud-ing expenditure on roads, which is covered in Table 2.9.2. The largest element in the programme is grants to British Rail for themaintenance of unremunerative railway passenger services. However, expendi-tore of about  62 million in 1969 on these will be gradually reduced asmeasures are taken to increase operating efficiency and to close down some services which represent poor value for money. It is also expected that therewill be some assumption of financial.responsibility by local communities for services which they wish to maintain in their areas.
3. Another large element in Government support for British Rail is the grants which are being paid for a limited period as an incentive to the elimination -tion by the Board of surplus track and signalling capacity. This surplus capa-city cannot be eliminated overnight and a five-year programme has beenagreed, now well under way, for its gradual disposal. Again, these grants will gradually taper away, from  15 million in 1969 to  5 million in 1973 after which they will cease.4. A similar system of tapering grants has been instituted in respect ofunprofitable activities which the National Freight Corporation (NFC) took over from British Rail relating to rail freight sundries. The Transport Act1968 enables grants to be made to the NFC of up to  60 million in all towards their losses in this respect in the five years 1969 to 1973, and it is intendedto run down the grants from the opening level of  17 million to a fraction of that amount in 1973, if the losses have not been eliminated by then.5. The main element of the Transport programme outside the nationalised industries is port investment, which is put at about  40 million for each of theyears 1970-71 and 1971-72, based on estimates provided by individual port authorities adjusted in the light of recent experience. In the longer term portinvestment will depend in the main on the policies of the proposed NationalPort Authority announced in the White Paper on the Re-organisation of the ports (Cmnd. 3903). This Authority will control the major ports of the country which handle about nine-tenths of the seaborne trade of the United Kingdom,and will be responsible for reviewing the investment plans for these ports. Butthis is unlikely to affect the pattern of investment much before 1973-74.6. The Government intend to continue their substantial support of busoperators through the rebate of bus fuel duty, estimated at about  21-J- million in 1970-71 and 1971-72. In addition bus operators are expected to receiveabout  8J million each year through the new bus grant scheme introduced bythe Government. Local authorities who make grants for rural bus and ferryservices will receive a 50 per cent contribution from the Government.7. Other major expenditure on public transport will arise from the schemeintroduced by the Government to allow grants to be paid to public authoritiesin respect of expenditure on infrastructure projects which assist the develop-ment of urban passenger transport facilities. Expenditure for this purpose islikely to rise from about  5  million in 1968-69 to about  12 million in 1970-71and to some  24-J million in 1971-72. The increase in these expenditures reflectsa growing appreciation of the important role of public transport in producingpractical and acceptable solutions to urban transport problems.8. From 1 January 1970 onwards the figures for &quot; other passenger trans-port &quot; include expenditure by the Greater London Council on London Trans-port, which for earlier periods is included with the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries (Table 2.22).9. Expenditure on road safety and research is increasing and giving agood return in social and economic terms. In particular road safety publicity and road user training is helping to maintain the improvement in road casualtyfigures which occurred towards the end of 1967.10. Civil aviation and shipping services cover expenditure at aerodromesoperated by the Board of Trade, on air navigation and miscellaneous services
provided by the Board, capital expenditure by local authorities at municipalaerodromes, Board of Trade expenditure on snipping services and net loans tothe shipping industry.HOUSING  million table 2.11 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimateInvestment and improvements in-cluding grants to the private sector and mortgage lending (net) Subsidies	862-2 232-7	802-7 270-0	828-3 312-8	862-4 339-4Total	1,094-9	1,072-7	1,141-1	1,201-81. The figures in Table 2.11 are broken down into investment in newdwellings together with improvements and net mortgage lending on the onehand and subsidies on the other. The estimates of expenditure on housing in-vestment in the public seotor and improvement grants and mortgage ad-vances to the private sector reflect action taken to increase or improve thehousing stock both public and private. The figures for subsidies do not beara similar relationship to work done in the years in question, though theyare an essential feature of housing policies. These latter figures, as well asthose for mortgage advances, are on an outturn price because of theproblems which arise in adjusting them to constant prices. (3)Investment and improvements2. The larger element in these figures represents the capital expenditure(mainly financed out of borrowing) on public sector housing by local authori-ties and new town corporations. It embraces new house building, the acquisi-tion of slums for clearance or old houses for improvement, and improvements to the public sector housing stock. A smaller element consists of payments ofimprovement grants to the private sector.3. There will be some shift of emphasis from new construction to the re-habilitation of older houses following the Housing Act of 1969. In England,the 135 priority authorities with the worst housing problems of over-crowdingand slum clearance will continue to be allowed to build to capacity, and else-where priority will be given to the replacement of slums, overspill and hous-ing for old people. In Scotland and Wales provision has been made to meetthe continuing need for new houses to replace slums, to provide for economic growth, and to overcome local shortages and maldistribution of the existinghousing stock.4. The estimates also include the net cost (after taking account of repay-ments received by local authorities in discharge of previous loans) of mort-gage lending by local authorities to private persons and housing associations.New advances by local authorities in 1969-70 will be ait the  55 million level for England and Wales announced in July 1969 and the same figure has beenO See Appendix III, paragraph 7.

The subsidy figures in these estimates comprise two elements. The first,and larger, represents subsidy payments by the central government to localauthorities. These payments are made under a series of Acts, the most recentof which is the Housing Subsidies Act 1967. Under this Act (and the equiva-lent legislation in Scotland) subsidies are directed towards the cost of interest on loans raised by local authorities to finance approved building programmes and are designed to bridge the gap between a 4 per cent interest rate and representative actual rates of interest. The smaller element consists of contri-butions from the local authorities&apos; General Rate Funds to lower the level of rents charged.LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES  million table 2.12 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimateCapital expenditure:				Public health and avoidance of				pollution       ......	214-2	221-3	232-3	251-3Improvement of the environment				and local facilities	101-8	107-5	108-1	109-0New towns, industrial and com-				mercial development, etc.	14-1	27-7	29-8	29-8Total	330 1	356-5	370-2	390-current expenditure:				Alt services	363-1	3850	398-5	406-7Grand total	693-2	741-5	768-7	796-81.

It in-cludes water supply, sewerage and refuse disposal, miscellaneous public healthexpenditure and clean air policy. The pressure for increased expenditure onthese services is considerable.

In so far as capital expenditure by local authorities is financed by borrowing, it requires loan sanction from the central govern-ment.2.

Industrial growth, increase in population and improved standards of living create an inescapable and rapidly rasing demandfor water, sewerage and refuse disposal. As the scale of these services increases,the technical problems also increase and they become more costly. For in-
stance, the rising demand for water involves gelling supplies from less necessarily.es-siblc sources, il also involves a higher standard of purification of the eilluenlsdischarged into rivers, which in luru means ilial lihe replacement of over-loaded, out-dated and incllicient sewage purification plant becomes incivas-ingly urgcnl. (hi refuse disposal, the growing shortage of convenientl placeslor lipping requires increased expenditure on incinerators, plant and vehicles.3. The second group comprises a variety of services lor the improve-nionl of the environment. If includes playing fields and swimming haiihs -andother recreational areas such as country parks, as well as expenditure on(own and country planning, which is primarily the redeveilopmenl of centralurban areas but also Ihe reclamation of derelict land. The administrative costs of Ideal authorities, expenditure on local authority ollices and on computersalso come in iliere. Despite dlie strong case for expenditure on ililiis group of services, til icy are generally less urgently required than the ilirsil group, andexpenditure on them is expected in total lo be kepi roughly level in orderlo allow room for the extra growth required for the first group.4.

Most expenditure on law and order services is governed by social anddemographic considerations such as the levels of crime and traffic, the numberof prisoners, the needs of children in public care and the growth of fire risks and in the incidence of fires. The load which all these impose is increasingand, despite improvements in methods, organisation and equipment, calls for more expenditure, especially on staff in the services concerned. Most of theexpenditure is incurred by local authorities; the central government contributeby way of the rate support grant, and for certain services (notably the police)by specific grants.Police2. The forecasts assume increases in police and civilian strengths (includ-ing traffic wardens).Prisons3. It is assumed that the prison population will continue to rise (fromnearly 39,000 at the beginning of the period); that there will be a progressive
increase of staff to deal with the increased population and new establishments;and that capital provision will be made for new prison places to relieve over-crowding and to carry forward the long overdue modernisation of existingprison buildings.Probation and after-care4. The estimated increase in expenditure is mainly the result of anexpected increase in the number of probation officers. Provision is also madefor an annual increase in the number of places in voluntary after-care hostels.Child care5. Expenditure arising from the implementation of the Children and young Persons Act 1969 will be first felt in 1970-71. Provision is made for increases in the number of children cared for, in staff, and in the costs of main-taining children in residential establishments.Fire services. Provision is made for a moderate increase in the numbers of full-timefiremen together with proportionate increases in supporting civilian staffs.Law courts and legal aid7. Expenditure is expected to rise because of the continuing increase in thework load of the courts and the extension of the fixed penalty system(l). the forecasts for both civil and criminal legal aid assume that the number of cases in which legal aid is obtained will continue to rise.Other services. Most of the increase in expenditure is attributable to the urban pro-gramme, a new programme of expenditure on community services in areas ofspecial social need. This programme also provides the funds for the communitydevelopment project, which is an experimental project to evaluate the social and community services in a limited number of deprived areas and to consider how to make these services more effective Increases in expenditure also arise from the criminal injuries compensation scheme as a result of a continued risewhich is expected in the number of applications.9. Expenditure on the remaining services included under this heading, ofwhich the Womcn&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service is the largest, is expected toremain about the same.(&apos;) The projected expenditure on law courts includes no extra provision for the implc-montation of Che Report of the Royal Commission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions.

Table 2.15 above shows details of expenditure on education and locallibrary services in the period 1968-69 to 1971-72. In 1968-69 this expenditure was over  2,200 million equivalent to more than 6 per cent of the size of the gross national product and local authorities, with the help of rate support grant, spent more than 80 per cent of it. These services employ well over one million people, half of them teachers.2. This expenditure covers the complete range of provision from nursery education to computers for university research. The main determinant of thegrowth in expenditure is the increase in numbers of pupils and students at every level. Between 1968-69 and 1971-72 total numbers in schools will rise byabout 7 per cent in primary schools by 6 per cent from 5.34 million to 5.66million and in secondary schools by over 9 per cent from 3.33 million to 3.63million. Expenditure incurred to meet these increases needs to be planned wellin advance; major decisions on educational expenditure generally have their main effect on the education service in the period roughly four to eight yearslater.
3. There will be a further large increase in numbers in secondary schoolsfrom the beginning of 1973 following the raising of the school leaving age. TheGovernment has authorised new building work worth  120 million for thispurpose. This and other capital expenditure on secondary schools will helpreorganisation on comprehensive lines.4. Numbers of students (lull-time equivalents) in further and higher education as a whole, which embraces the range from part-time day releasecourses to work at postgraduate level, are expected to rise by over 10 per cent between 1968-69 and 1971-72. Universities and colleges of education andfurther education will continue to expand accordingly. Between 1967 and1971 the proportion of the age-group entering full-time and sandwich courses in higher education is expected to rise from 14 per cent to about 20 per cent.This expansion and the corresponding contribution from part-time studentswill increase the flow of highly qualified manpower to the economy.5. To maintain standards of provision for rising numbers current expeiulilure on schools must rise over the period to l&apos;)7l-72 by about 8 per cent andon post-school education by rather more than It) per cent. Table 2.15 showsthat current expenditure on primary and secondary schools is expected lo riseby 11 per cent and on further and higher education by 15 per cent. Somemargin of expenditure is therefore available for Ihe improvement of standards.6. In the schools. Ihe number of qualified teachers available is expectedlo rise by 12 per cent between 1968-60 and IT/l-72. nearly itwice the rate of increase expected in (he number of pupils. This will make possible a continuedreduction in the number of over-large classes, especially in primary schools, a major objective of education policy. Resources will also continue lo be madeavailable for Ihe replacement of some old school and university buildings andto improve facilities in colleges of education and further education, particu-larly at the polytechnics.7. The range of the education services will be widened when the Openyniversity&apos;s first courses begin in January 1971.

Expenditure at constant prices onthe service as a whole is planned to increase by about 3.5 percent in 1970-71over 1969-70 and 4.3 percent in 1971-72 over 1970-71.Hospital capital expenditure2. Progress in replacing and modernising hospital buildings will continue on the linos sot out in the Hospital Building Programme (England and Wales)(Cmnd. 3000) and the Review of the Hospital Plan for Scotland (Cnind.2877). The programme is intended not only to match Ihe movement and increase in population but also to tackle progressively (he problem of obsolescent-lescence; the total number of beds available will nol significantly increase.Expenditure covers a wide range of schemes from small projects affectingparts of hospitals, completed in a few weeks, to new hospitals, taking several years to plan, build and bring into use. Maximum value for money is soughtthrough control of costs and the sotting of standards. Work on the intro-duction of industrialised building techniques and the use of standard designsis being developed.Hospital running costs3.

The schemes of social security cash benefits make up the largest ofthe public expenditure programmes. National insurance benefits (principallyretirement pensions) account for over two-thirds of total expenditure on these schemes. The non-contributory schemes, financed wholly from general taxa-tion and consisting of war pensions, supplementary benefits and family allow-ances, make up the balance apart from administration.2. Table 2.17 above shows, on the basis of existing benefit levels, theestimated distribution of expenditure between the various benefits up to 1971-72, compared with how it was distributed in 1968-69.Demographic factors3. At present there are 7.1 million retirement pensioners; by the end of1972, because of increasing numbers of old people, with a larger proportionentitled to pension, and because of a continuing trend towards earlier retire-ment, as well as lighter mortality, there are expected to be 7.6 million. Atpresent there are 6.9 million children for whom family allowances are pay-able; by 1972 it is expected that there will be 7.3 million. In the field of short-term benefits, allowance has had to be made for an underlying upward trend in sickness benefit claims. For all these reasons there would, as Table2.17 illustrates, be a substantial increase in the future cost of social security benefits even apart from changes in the levels of benefit.Increases and improvements4. The Governments policy is to maintain the value of contributory benefits and to do everything possible to ensure that pensioners and otherbeneficiaries should continue to share in the natiorfs rising living standards. It is not however practicable to forecast the exact date and amountof future benefit increases, which have to be settled in the light of the circum-stances at the time. The forecasts of social security expenditure in Table 2.17,while taking full account of all the known demographic factors and of the
new earnings-related schemo(&quot;), are therefore purely illustrative so far as levels of benefit are concerned. They indicate how costs would rise even at existinglevels of benefit, and do not of course imply that benefits will slay al the same level during the period under review.5. Unlike the other major public expenditure programmes a decision to change the levels of social security benefit (as dislinol from ihe fundamentalstructure of the scheme) need only be taken a few months Wore the newrale is payable. The rales can therefore be adjusted to lake account of thegrowth in national income and the developing needs of the community. Hutincreased expenditure on social security benefits has to be met by higherinsurance contributions anil taxation raised from the nation as a whole. Theextent to which it will be possible to make further real improvements in thelevel of benefits, over and above expenditure required lo take account of price inovcmeiils(&quot;), therefore depends on the rale of growth of the national wealth; and such improvements represent an important potential call on (he( onlingcney Reserve.National Superannuation(i.

This covers expenditure by the Ministry of Public Building and Workson accommodation occupied by Government Departments and expenditure onrates (including contributions in lieu of rales) on Government property. Thelargest part of the MPBW expenditure relates to office buildings, with smallerprovisions for Government training centres, scientific and research buildings and building research and development work, museums and galleries and mis-ccllancous buildings such as the Royal Mint and the Stationery Ollice.2. Three quarters of the total relates to current expenditure, includingrents, rates, maintenance, running costs of Government buildings and alsostaff costs. As regards the rest, of the  39.1 million forecast for 1971-72 new buildings account for  34.7 million. The increase in capital expenditure is largely attributable to an increase in expenditure on new building work,mainly for computer centres and other office buildings. A considerable num-ber of computer centre projects is in hand. A programme to build nineregional computer centres for the Inland Revenue was announced recently.Besides providing a more efficient service this programme is expected to saveeventually about 6,000 staff. Expenditure on other ollices provides for schemeslo carry out the Governments policy of dispersing stall&apos; from London, to house additional staff and to replace accommodation which is sub-standardor uneconomic.TABLE 2.19 at 1969 Survey prices

The public expenditure estimates for Northern Ireland which arcshown in Table 2.21 above have been prepared by the Northern Ireland De-partmcnts. The Northern Ireland Government is responsible for the admini-stration of these services and the expenditure is not subject to detailed controlfrom Westminster. The bulk of the expenditure is met from Northern Ircland&apos;sassigned share of United Kingdom taxation, but this revenue is supplementedin particular cases under agreed arrangements. The level of expenditure onthese services is in general determined on the basis of parity of services between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. However, expenditure on assist-ance to industry and employment is related to the level of unemploymentin Northern Ireland, which has been persistently much higher than in thedevelopment areas of Great Britain.
2. The figures in table 2.21 represent public expenditure for which theNorthern Ireland Government is responsible, and do not therefore include expenditure on such items as defence and most agricultural support, which is contained in the relevant United Kingdom programmes. The figures includethe increase in public expenditure in Northern Ireland announced in the Com-miihique issued following discussions between the Home Secretary and theNorthern Ireland Government (Cmnd. 4178).CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BY NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES, ETC.  million table 2,2?. ai I960 Survey prices	1968 69	1969 70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			Expenditure on fixed assets				Post Olliee  . .       ......	367-8	403-1	468-6	497-7National Coal Board	58 0	63 0	610	600Electricity Council and Boards	5000	436-5	3700	335-0North of Scotland Hydro-Electric				Board      ........	7-9	8-7	14-5	13-1South of Scotland Electricity Board	61 -9	&apos; 61-7	64 0	55-4Gas Council and Boards	228-5	233-1	233-0	201-british Steel Corporation	69-0	105-0	135-0	180-british   Overseas   Airways   Cor-				poration	40-4	51-1	84-5	70-7British European Airways	52-8	23 0	43 0	47-british Airports Authority. .	12-1	11-8	12-7	13-british Railways Board	84-0	75-0	77-0	80-5London Transport Board	30-7	16-1		British Transport Docks Board	15-8	18-7	13-7	11-british Waterways Board	0-9	l-l	l-l	l-lTransport Holding Company	20-6	0-5	0-9	1-2National Freight Corporation	1-8	32-5	28-6	23-7National Bus Company	2-3	13-5	15-8	15-2Scottish Transport Group	1-5	41	3-7	3-6Total expenditure on fixed assets				by nationalised industries   . .	1.556-0	1,558-5	1,627-1	1,61 1-7Shortfall     ........		100-0	- 125-0	150-0BBC,     1TA,    Covcnt    Garden				Market Authority	14-8	20-6	19-9	21-6Total expenditure on fixed assets	1,570-8	1,479 1	1,522-0	1,483-3Sales of fixed assets	43-8	360	31-7	27-1Statistical adjustments(i)	- 11-5	-12-9	  12-5	-21-2Total   gross   domestic   fixed				capital formation	1,515-5	1,430-2	1,477-8	1,4350Other capital expenditure	-5-5	8-4	-3-9	1-4Total	1,510 0	1,438-6	1,473-9	1,436-4(i) Deduction of certain central government capital grants lo nationalised industries, andof Post Office repayment services (included in local authorities capital expenditure), lo avoiddouble-counting.I. The capital expenditure of the nationalised industries has been risingin the past decade and is expected to continue at much the present levelfrom 1969-70 to 1971-72. An upward trend is expected again thereafter. This
overall pattern is the net result of a number of changes in the main programmes.Telecommunications2. Demand for telecommunications both inland and overseas, requires ahigh and rising level of investment throughout the period. The main objectivewill continue to be the improvement of the quality of service. In addition tothe growth of traffic and the connection of new customers, the capital pro-gramme caters for further modernisation, the expansion of the data transmis-sion service and measures to aid productivity. The estimates include provisionfor converting the few remaining manual telephone exchanges to automaticworking and extending subscriber trunk dialling (STD) to all customers.Fuel3. Investment by the fuel industries is expected to decline until 1972-73.Within this pattern the National Coal Board&apos;s investment is likely to remain at about present levels (subject to the development of its participation in oil and gas exploration).4. Electricity investment consists of a fairly steady rate of expenditure onthe distribution system and a variable element of expenditure on generationand transmission. The latter is likely to go on falling until about 1972, whiledemand for electricity in England and Wales moves into balance with the plantexpected to be available. The forecasts allow for ordering two new power stations in 1970 Heysham in England and one in the West of Scotland. TheGovernment have recently approved the inclusion of stations at Drax.Sizewell, and the Isle of Grain, in the Central Electricity Generating board&apos;slonger term programme. The case for starting a second station in England in1970 will be reviewed early next year. The timing of later orders will be con-sidered subsequently in the light of the demand forecasts and other relevant factors.5. The gas industry&apos;s expenditure is directed to the rapid introduction of natural gas through the establishment of a pipeline system for transmission ofthe gas and the conversion of consumers&apos; equipment to use it: expenditure isexpected to reach a peak in 1970-71 and to fall away gradually thereafter.Steel6. The British Steel Corporation^ investment plans for the long term arestill tentative and the estimates shown in Table 2.22 are preliminary figures.Some increase from the present level of expenditure seems likely in the nextfew years.Transport7. The re-equipment of the two state airlines is forecast to result in BEA&apos;expenditure reaching a peak in 1971-72, and boac&apos;s running at a high levelfrom 1970-71 onwards and rising to a peak at the end of the period.8. The investment of the other parts of the nationalised transport sectorwill probably continue at a steady level throughout the period. The proposednationalisation of much of the ports industry will in due course have the effect
of including the investment of the major ports in the figures for the nationalised industries sector, but this will not of course add to the total real demand on resources.9. Of the other major transport undertakings, the National Freight Cor-poration will direct much of its investment to replacing vehicles but some alsoto making profitable use of opportunities as they arise. The National bus company is also concerned mainly with vehicle programmes, with their busesneeding replacement at a fairly even rate. Much of the annual investment of theScottish Transport Group also is devoted to replacing buses, but in additionthey have a steady programme of expenditure on new ships to modernise thefleets serving the Clyde and the Western Islands of Scotland.10. The future course of British RaiFs investment will depend on thedevelopment of the Board&apos;s corporate planning; in the meantime it is assumed that railway investment will continue at about the same rate as for the last fewyears.ShortfallII. For the nationalised industries as a whole, experience shows that capital expenditure in the aggregate tends to fall short of the approved figure.For the purpose of forecasting total investment by nationalised industries,therefore, reductions (shown as &quot; shortfall &quot;) of  100 million in 1969-70,  125million in 1970-71 and  150 million in 1971-72 have been made from theaggregate expenditure on fixed assets by the individual industries given inTable 2.22.SCOTLAND:Expenditure within the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibility  million table 2.2.1 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional out turn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimateCivil defence	10	0-6	0-6	0-6Roads and public lighting	650	66-3	711	77-transport	1-6	4-1	5-3	7-other assistance  to employment				and industry	2-8	3-6	4 1	4-5Research Councils, week.	2-S	2-7	3-0	3-3Agriculture, fisheries and forestry. .	51-4	59-7	60-9	61-4Housing	226-1	2260	230-1	238-local environmental services	84-5	86-2	88-6	89-law and order	48-4	49 0	52-7	55-2Education	213-9	219-8	229-4	239-8Health and welfare	191-9	194-9	201-6	209-5Miscellaneous services	4-8	4-5	4-8	4-9Total	893-9	917-4	952-2	991-5By Spending Authority Central government - 368-local authorities - 538-public corporations     -  45-1952-2
I. Table 2.23 provides separate expenditure figures relating to services inScotland for which the Secretary of State&apos;s Departments are directly or indirectly responsible. Besides expenditure on national services such as de-fence and overseas aid, for which allocations are possible only on an arbitrarybasis, they exclude expenditure by Great Britain Departments and the nation-nationalised industries in Scotland.2. The Scottish figures show differences in the pattern of expenditure by comparison with Great Britain as a whole, corresponding to differences in circumstances and needs. One of the main differences is in housing. Because ofScotland&apos;s reliance on rented housing and because the housing programme isbeing maintained at a high level to meet the needs of slum clearance, urbanrenewal and industrial relocation, Scotland has a proportionately large share ofpublic sector housing investment.3. The responsibilities of the Secretary of Slate&apos;s Departments in relationto civil defence, roads and public lighting, housing and local environmental services are virtually the same as those of the corresponding English minister-ries. Differences in the coverage of other expenditure blocks tire (briefly) asfollows:  Transport: The Scottish figures cover only rural bus and ferry grants,infrastructure expenditure, support to the Scottish Transport Group,certain shipping companies, and departmental administration. They donot include fuel grants, new bus grants, support to British Rail, theNational Freight Corporation, the British Waterways Board, the port authorities and civil aviation.Other assistance to employment and industry: The figures relate only to assistance to the coal industry (by way of grants to the two ScottishElectricity Boards for using extra coal) and to expenditure by the highlands and Islands Development Board and the Scottish TouristBoard. They exclude Redundancy Fund payments. SET additional payments, payments of regional employment premiums, investment grants and certain other grants.Research Councils: The figures cover only agricultural research in Scot-land financed from Scottish Votes; they do not include Scotland\s share of expenditure from the Science. Social Science, Medical. Agri-cultural, and Natural Environment Research Councils.Agriculture, fisheries and forestry: This includes the Scottish share of the costs of agricultural support and other agricultural and fishing servicesmet separately by the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries forScotland. Other expenditure on agricultural support, and on animal health services which is met by the Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, is excluded, as well as expenditure by the Forestry Corn-mission.Education and local libraries: The figures include all expenditure by theScottish Education Department and local authorities, including expen-diture on schools, further education, teacher training, youth serviceetc. Expenditure by the University Grants Committee in Scotland is excluded.
4. Responsibility in respect ol&apos; social work services, exercised in Englandpartly by the Home Office under the law and order head and partly by theDepartment of Health and Social Security under the health and welfare head,is now grouped together in Scotland in view of the setting up of local authoritysocial work departments with effect from 17 November 1969 and the cominginto operation (sometime towards the end of 1970-71) of the new system ofchildren s hearings to replace the juvenile courts under Part 111 of the social work (Scotland) Act 1968. Total expenditure on social work services isexpected to rise from just over  I7J million in 1969-70 lo about  20 million in 1971-72. In all tables in this While Paper, however, this expenditure fallspartly under law and order and partly under health and welfare.5.

They include not onlyexpenditure which is the direct responsibility of his Department but alsoexpenditure by local authorities, hospitals and other agencies operating in wales, for which the Secretary of State has indirect responsibility.2. Table 2.24 shows that this expenditure was  209 million in 1968-69.This is expected to increase lo  237 million in 1971-72. Nearly 50 per cent of the total is expenditure by (he Welsh Office, the remainder being expendi-lure incurred by local authorities and the other public bodies concerned.Where there are differences in the pattern of expenditure in Wales comparedwith that for Great Britain as a whole, they correspond with differences in circumstances and needs.3. The table does not show the full extent of public expenditure in Wales.Other Government expenditure (for example, on education and social security)and expenditure by the nationalised industries are also of great importance loWales and are of concern lo Ihe Secretary of Stale in view of his responsibilities for the oversight of Go vermeil t activities in general throughout the Principality.Arrangements have therefore been made, lo enable the Secretary of State not
only lo look at his own programmes in relation lo ihe corresponding english and Scottish programmes but also to lake a view of the Welsh parts of other ministers&apos; prog rani iries.4. The Secretary of State \s responsibilities in relation to roads and publiclighting, housing, local environmental services and health and welfare arevirtually the same as those of the corresponding English Ministers.5. The figures for &quot;olhcr expenditure &quot; relate to a variety of items suchas rural bus and ferry grants and infrastructure expenditure on transport, theexpenditure by the Wales Tourist board, and giants to Ihe National Libraryof Wales and the National Museum of Wales. They do not include expendi-lure for which the Ministry of Transport and Ihe Hoard of Trade arc respon-sible in support of British Rail, Ihe National Freight Corporation, the BritishWaterways Board, the iK)rl authorities and civil aviation. Nor do they includeRedundancy Fund payments, SET additional payments, payments of regional employment premiums, investment grants or certain other grants.

APPENDIX local AUTHORITIES FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THEGOVERNMENTI. There are 1235 operating units of local government in England, 234 inScotland and 181 in Wales, and together with Ihe local authorities in NorthernIreland they are responsible for some 30 per cent of total public expenditureexcluding debt interest. The great bulk of this expenditure is incurred by a reJa-tively few large authorities; for example over two-thirds of total local authority expenditure in England is the responsibility of less than one-seventh of the totalnumber of authorities.2. Local authorities are in the first instance responsible for most of theexpenditure on roads (other than trunk roads), housing, local environmental ser-vices, law and order and (largest of all) education.3. Many aspects of local government will be affected by the reorganisationwhich iis to take place in England and in Scotland following the reports of thetwo Royal Commissions on local Government, and also in Wales.4. The present financial arrangements between Ihe central government andlocal authorities differ between capital expenditure and current expenditure, withcloser control over capital. All such expenditure initiated by local authorities onprojects financed by borrowing requires loan sanction. In some major programmes housing and schools a specific approval is also needed for the start of projects.Capital grants for principal roads are approved for individual schemes. most other projects do not receive capital grants, but the Government meets a substantial part of the cost through continuing annual grants towards the interest charges on the borrowing from which the projects are financed. There are special Govern-mcnt subsidies towards the interest charges incurred on housing; these subsidies,together with other Government subsidies and Ihe subsidies paid from the ralesto balance the local authorities&apos; housing revenue accounts, are shown in the&quot;Subsidies&quot; figures in Table 2.11, with the capital costs of new houses shown under Ihe heading &quot; Investment anil improvements&quot;. Interest charges resultingfrom other capital programmes count as part of the revenue expenditure whichreceives rate support grant under the arrangements explained in paragraph below; these interest charges are hoi, however, apportioned to the tables for thevarious functional programmes.5. II is far from easy to translate programmes of these capital projects intoforecasts of annual expenditure. Generally speaking the estimates of lihe phasing of the expenditure year by ycair are worked out by Departments from theircentral experience rather than provided by the local authorities themselves. It ishoped that Ihe development of the relationships between Departments and localauthorities following reorganisation will facilitate improved arrangements forforward programmes.6. Estimates of the total revenue expenditure of local authorities as a whole are discussed with the local authority associations lor Ihe purpose of determiningrale support, grant. These determinations take place every other year for (liecoming two-year period. The lasl was made in l%8 in respect of 1960-70 and1970-71; the next is due to be made next year, in respect of 1971-72 and 1972-73.The total figures used in such determinations are accompanied by forecasts ofthe revenue expenditure expected to be incurred on each of the functional pro-grammes, anil individual local authorities are thereafter expected lo be guided by this indication of relative priorities. However, Ihe actual amount of revenue expenditure incurred by an individual local authority, whether financed from ilsrate revenue or from rate support grant, and the detailed allocation of this totalbetween individual services are in the hands of that authority
APPENDIX 11COMPARISON WITH PAST PUBLISHED ESTIMATES OF FORWARDPROGRAMMESI. The following table compares Ihe estimates in this While Paper of expendi-turc in 1969-70 and 1970-71 with those given for the corresponding categories ofexpenditure in flic White Paper of February 1969 &quot; Public Expenditure, 1968-69to 1970-71 &quot; (Cniiul. 3936) revalued at 1969 Survey prices.2. Of the larger changes in 1969-70 the estimate tor &quot;Oilier Assistance to employment and Industry &quot; incorporates a revised estimate of the proportion of manufacturing investment eligible for investment grant. The increase in Iheestimate for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is hugely attributable to the 1909Farm Price Review. As against these increases in 1909-70, there are lower osti-mntcs for &quot;Other Military Defence&quot; (a re-phasing of progress payments onITS.-built military aircraft, together with an overall reduction in the cost of theprogramme) and Focal Environmental Services (new assessment of expenditure by local authorities). The small net increase in the provision for identifiedexpenditure programmes has been met from the Contingency Reserve whichoriginally stood at  75 million..3. As regards 1970-71, there tire, for the treasons explained in the preceding paragraph, increases for &quot; Other Military Defence &quot;, &quot; Other Assistance to Employ-monl and Industry&quot; and &quot;Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry&quot;.

1. These notes explain Ihe conventions and classifications used in this white paper. A fuller account of the principles underlying this presentation and ofcertain technical aspects of it is given in the Government&apos;s Green Paper of April,1069 (&apos;), particularly in Appendix II.Definitions and coverage2. In order that (ho figures can be consistent as far as possible with the statistics and forecasts of national income and expenditure, they follow themethods, sources and definitions which (he Central Statistical Ollice use for public sector transactions in the national income accounts^). The public sectorcomprises central government (including the National Insurance Funds), localauthorities and public corporations (including the nationalised industries). Apartfrom transactions on operating account by the nationalised industries and othertrailing bodies, till current ami capital transactions are covered. Transfers betweenthe public sector and oilier sectors are included but internal transfers, such ascentral government grants and loans to local authorities and public corporations,are generally eliminated. Indirect taxes, including selective employment lax paidby public bodies, are included as part of the cost of the programmes to whichthey relate and are credited as receipts by Ihe authority to which Ihey accrue.Subsidies to public authorities&apos; trailing services and to public corporations arealso included, since lliey are paid to their operating accounts.3. The figures in this While Paper exclude imputed rents which are usedin (he national income statistics to measure Ihe value of the use made of publicly-owned fixed capilal assets in the provision of public services; this is because ofthe dillicullies of estimation and deficiencies of coverage. Since imputed renlswould be entered both as a receipt and a payment, their inclusion would make no difference to (be figures for (lie balances in the tables which show bothreceipts and expenditure by Ihe public sector.4. At (he back of Ihe Blue Hook, &quot;National Income and Expenditure, 1969&quot;,a table showing the Treasury analysis of public expenditure provides figures forpast financial years on a basis which is consistent with the calendar year figures shown elsewhere in Ihe Blue Book. Expenditure in this (able is analysed byprogrammes according to the classification used by the Government for taking decisions on public expenditure. The same classification is used in the talliesanalysing expenditure by programmes in this White Paper.Price basis5. The Blue Book shows expenditure for the past al outturn (or current)prices.; that is, the actual prices al which expenditure was incurred during theyear in question. Mill for Ihe purpose of Government decisions the forwardestimates are made on a constant price basis. This enables comparisons lo bemade of changes in demands on resources arising directly or indirectly from public expenditure in successive years, and the growth of total public expenditurelo be related to what is acceptable in 1 lie light of the likely growth of Ihe economy as a whole.(\. The estimates of current expenditure on goods and services are on asimilar price basis to that used in the 1969-70 Supply Estimates, apart fromthe increase in rales of selective employment tax introduced in Ihe April, I960Budget. Those for gross domestic fixed capilal formation are mostly at March,1969 prices. In some cases, however, such as roads and education, dhey relateto the price basis currently in use for planning purposes which may differ from march, 1969.(&apos;) &quot; Public Expenditure: A New Presentation,&quot; Cmnd, 40 17.(-) Described in &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and Methods,&quot; f-IMSO, 1968.
7. The expression of transfer payments- payments which do iiot involve adirect purchase of goods and services at constant prices can only be on an arbi-trary basis: for- example, relating them lo general purchasing power. Some grantsl and subsidies, such as grants to universities and llie aid programme, arc expressedin money terms, that is, at ihe amount expected lo be disbursed in each year,irrespective of price changes which may by then have occurred. Although thistreatment progressively overstates the demands on resources which such moneyexpenditure would transfer, there is nothing in Ihe change in the amount of moneybeing provided front year to year that can be specifically attributed In Ihe effectof price changes. An overall adjustment related to Ihe estimated movement in theprice level of Ihe output of Ihe economy as a whole is therefore included in theline &quot; Relative price effect and other adjustments &quot; in the relevant tables. social security benefits are treated differently, in the manner explained below. Wheresubsidies arc intended to reimburse deficits, Ihe estimates may be entirely notional.Agricultural subsidies arc Ihe most important example. The forward figures of debt interest involve the neutral assumption that interest rates continue at their present levels; this is not, of course, a forecast. Allowance is made for some reduction inthe total volume of debt, and for the refunding of current debt. These projectionsare made at outturn prices and deflated lo constant prices by the price deflatorapplicable to the gross domestic product.8. For reasons explained in paragraph 30 of the Green Paper estimates of public sector receipts are in some tables set alongside the estimates of expen-dilure. Taxes and other receipts (other than social security contributions), includ-ing charges for goods and services, have in the first instance been estimated aloutturn prices. They have then been deflated lo estimated 1969-70 outturn prices in the manner described for those items of expenditure originally estimated atoutturn prices.9. In all the tables showing expenditure by programmes social security benefits are expressed in terms of existing levels of benefit since, as explained in Section 2.17, it is not practicable lo forecast the exact dale anil amount of future benefit increases. But in order that the total of public expenditure willprovide a measure of the estimated demand on resources, the line &quot; relative price effect and other adjustments&quot; contains a nel entry for social securitycomprising two elements (a) a downward adjustment relating to the forecastmovement in prices and (b) a notional upward adjustment lor biennial upralingson account of such price movements. On the receipts side social security conlribu-lions have been calculated in a similar manner. The entries against this item reflectIhe continuation of existing rates of contributions, and a nel adjustment lo allow for movements in prices and a notional biennial uprating is made in the line&quot;Other receipts&quot; in Table 1.2 and in the line &quot;Taxes and other unallocatedreceipts&quot; in Tables 1.7 lo 1.10.10. In order that estimated receipts may be compared witli estimated expen-diture on a consistent price basis a further overall adjustment, included within&quot;Relative price ellect and other adjustments&quot;, converts the expenditure figures at 1969 Survey prices lo estimated 1969-70 outturn prices.Relative price effectII. The definition of constant prices applied lo Ihe measurement of public expenditure described above follows thai used in the national income statistics.This means thai no account is taken of possible increases in rales of pay beyondthe sum already agreed for the financial year 1969-70 and reflected in the1969-70 Supply Estimates. The output of those employed in Ihe public sector istaken as equal to their pay; productivity and pay are taken as constant.12. As a rest 111 of Ihe use of this convention, llie estimates of public expendi-ture as a proportion of gross domestic product al constant prices will progressivelyunderstate what the proportion would be al current prices. This is becauseincreases in productivity in Ihe private sector will be reflected in increased outputat constant prices, while increases in productivity in the public sector will be(*) As measured by gross domestic product al factor eosl.
ignored except in cases where a given task is performed by fewer staff. Further-more, rising productivity in tho private sector will be accompanied by rising real earnings which tend to be matched by public sector real earnings.13. One way of making allowance for this situation is to add to the constant &apos;price series a growing amount equal to the expected future difference (derivedfrom past trends) between the share in total output of public expenditure on cur-rent goods and services at current prices and its share at constant prices. Approximate calculations suggest that this difference is of the order of I+ to 2 per cent ayear of public expenditure at factor cost on current goods and services. The rela-tive size of the difference has, however, varied from year to year and may beexpected to continue to do so. This is the basis of the adjustment for the &quot; relative price effect&quot; insofar as it applies to public consumption (current expenditure on goods and services). It has not yet proved possible to allocate it by programmes,though clearly the programmes which involve employing relatively large numbersof people, e.g. health and education, will account for most of it. A similar adjust-ment has been applied to those transfer payments which have been classified asresourcesC). The relative prices of other expenditures may also move diflererati-ally and adjustments should in theory be made for these. But in practice the size of tho corrections is not likely to be significant and some of them may be in adownward direction; no allowance has, therefore, been made for them.14. Tho end product of all these adjustments is a sot of projections whichdiscount the effect of general price changes, as do all constant price estimates, butalso attempt to allow for changes in relative prices which projections of quantitiesand of employment alone cannot do.Presentation of adjustments15. The estimates for individual programmes have been entered in the de-tailed tables of Pant 2 without any of the adjustments described in the preceding paragraphs. They havo been carried through on the same price basis into the summary tables in Parts 1 and 3. With the exception of overseas aid and social security these estimates arc referred to as &quot;at 1969 Survey prices&quot;. The line&quot; Relative price effect and other adjustments &quot; in the summary table includes alltho adjustments necessary to convert the expenditure estimates to 1969-70 outturn prices, the basis on which the totals of public expenditure are expressed. the adjustment line also includes an allowance for shortfall in the years 1969-70 and1970-71 and for statistical adjustments (timing and roundings). The allowance forshortfall is included to correct a tendency towards over-estimation of the figures in the early years of the period ahead. The total adjustment shown in the tables for the years 1968-69 to 1971-72 is made up as follows:-  million	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			I.

Id. The (able in Appendix 11 compares programme by programme on a emuparable price basis (he estimates of public expenditure in 1969-70 anil 1970-71 as given in Ihe Chancellor of the Exchequers statement of 201 h Eohnmry I5)69(*) withthe lalosl estimates of expemliluro.

, Attribution of expenditure and receipts lo programmes19.   A!! expenditure, irrespective of the authority by which it is incurred,,- has been allocated in the tables to one or other of twenty functional programmes.The public expenditure of Northern Ireland and the capital expenditure by thef nationalised industries (including the broadcasting authorities and the covent garden Market Authority) are brought together under single headings; and so isdebt interest. In Tables 1.7 to 1.10 all receipts from sales and charges and from contributions (national insurance, national health and Redundancy Fund) havebeen allocated to programmes and as fat&quot; as possible earnings (trading surpluses,rent, dividends and interest) have also been attributed to programmes in accord-ance with the allocation of the associated expenditure on assets. A relatively small amount of rent, dividends and interest, which it. is not possible to allocate, is included with receipts from taxation and certain other miscellaneous items ofrevenue in the line &quot; Taxes and other unallocated receipts &quot;.20. in the case of nationalised industries and other public enterprises, grosstrading surpluses have to provide for interest charges on capital and (where appropriate) tax. payments. This reduces the amount available to the public enter-prises for gross capital formation, in order that their residual financing rcquire-ment should not be understated and that the expenditure totals should correspond with previous presentations, the appropriate interest and tax payments have beendeducted from the trading surpluses and entered among unallocated receipts.21. Expenditure on overseas aid is included within line I of category Ain Table 1.2 net of loan service payments: it represents the net resource costof this expenditure within the continuing aid programme. In the figures of total public expenditure (line 14 of Table 1.2), and in the other tables of the white paper where this total appears, overseas aid expenditure is included gross of loanservice payments; this is the basis on which the programme is planned and con-trolled, as representing the best measure of new expenditure in the form of trans-fcrs and lending overseas. The remainder of public expenditure on overseas aid i.c, the balance between Ihe figures in line 1 and those in line 14 of Table 1.2 is included in line 4 of category B of that table; and line 8 of that table includes the corresponding amount received in repayments of capital and payments ofinterest on earlier aid loans. This treatment of expenditure on overseas aid is alsofollowed in Tables 1.7 to 1.10.
