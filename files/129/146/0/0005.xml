PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: 1968-69 to 1973-74FOREWORDIn April this year the Government proposed that &quot;there should be pub-lished towards the end of each calendar year a White Paper which will present to Parliament the results of the Government^ consideration of theprospect for public expenditure&quot; (Cmnd. 4017, paragraph 5).This proposal was welcomed by the Select Committee on Procedure intheir Report on the Scrutiny of Public Expenditure and Administration (H.C.410). In the debate on this Report on 21 October the Government announced their intention to produce the first White Paper in the new series in the nearfuture, and this was foreshadowed also in the Queen&apos;s Speech. The presentWhite Paper fulfils this intention.December, 1969

PART public EXPENDITURE THE GENERAL PROSPECTIntroduction1. This White Paper sets out the Governments plans for public expen-diture for the current financial year 1969-70 and for the next two years. it also gives projections of expenditure on a provisional and approximate basis for.the two subsequent years, 1972-73 and 1973-74, for which the Governmenthave not yet taken decisions. These plans and projections give expression tothe Governments policy that expenditure on public services shall expandthroughout the period broadly in line with the growth of the nation&apos;s resourcesas a whole.2. Public expenditure is a generic term for a large number of pro-grammes and services administered by individual departments, local auihori-ties, nationalised industries, and other public corporations and agencies, allfinanced in varying degrees by the Government and subject in varying waysto central influence or control. At any one time it reflects the results of acomplex of decisions, some stretching back several years, the effects of whichwill often be felt for many years to come. Basic reviews of policy are madein particular programmes from time to time. But most of the decisions whichthe Government takes on public expenditure from year to year are directed to the questions: what modifications should be made to existing pro-grammes? How much provision should be made for new policies or fordevelopments of existing programmes? What is the sensible allowance toinclude for further developments of policy, or to meet unexpected turns ofevents?3. In making their plans and carrying them out the Government haveto take account of changing circumstances at home and abroad. They also have to allow for special features of the programmes themselves. For someprogrammes, expenditure depends in part on Government decisions but inpart also on what happens beyond the reach of government. Examples aresickness benefit, where the Government decides the rate of benefit but the occurrence of sickness determines whether benefit is paiid; or investment grants, where the rate of grant is decided by the Government but its paymentdepends on the amount of investment done by industry. In other cases a probable call for additional spending can be foreseen, but not the precisetiming and sca:le of that expenditure for example, support for future, as yet unformulated, technological projects. Then, for nearly 30 per cent oftotal public expenditure, local authorities, with their own degree of autonomy, share responsibility with the Government; broadly, their capitalexpenditure which is financed by borrowing requires central sanction, butthey have power to decide how much current expenditure to incur, in thelight of the guidance which the Government is able to give on the standards of services and on the relative priorities between services and of the volumeof Government funds available to them in support of their own revenue(see Appendix I).4. For all these reasons any forward plans for public expenditure as awhole need to be flexible, and the figures in which plans are expressed at.any one time should be interpreted with this in mind. The next sections ofthis paper briefly trace how expenditure has moved in recent years, andthen set out the future prospects.
The course of pubMc expenditure over the last ten years. Total public expenditure was running in 1968-69 at some  19,600million at do-days pricesC). [This was equivalent in size m.p. 52 per cent ofthe gross national product, compared with just under 44 per cent in 1964-65and 41 per cent in 1959-60(-).] [Within the total of  19,600 million in 1968-69,]  12,500 million or roughly two-thirds was spent directly by public bodiesthemselves on the purchase of resources. The balance of  7,000 millionconsisted almost entirely of transfer payments, such as social security benefits and industrial subsidies; it is the recipients of these payments, not the public authorities, who decide how the money is spent.6. The following table shows in broad terms how, within the risingtotal, the composition of public expenditure was being changed:PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY GROUPS OF PROGRAMMES:1959-60 TO 1968-69TABLE 1.1	.1959-60.	1964-65		1968-69			outturn	out	urn	provisional outturn					Average		Average	Average			annual		annual	annual			increase		increase	increase			per cent		per cent	pei- cent	 m	 m	(ft) on (a)	 m	(d) on (b)	Ul) on (a)	(a)	W	(c)	id)	(e)	if)At 1969 Survey Prices						Defence and external re-						lations	2,648	2,856	1-5	2,772	-0-7	0-5Commerce and industry (i)	676	634	-1-3	1,498	9-0	3-2Environmental services ..	1,759	2,684	8-8	3,223	4-7	7-0Social services	4,619	5,801	4-7	7,317	60	5-other services	600	641	1-3	843	7-1	3-9Nationalised industries, etc.						capital expenditure	1,081	1,376	4-9	1,510	2-3	3-8Debt interest	1,479	1,564	1-1	2,051	7-0	3-7Relative price effect and						other adjustments (ii) ..	-583	-472		381		At 1969-70 outturn prices						Total	12,279	15,084	4-2	19,595	&apos;   5-9	5-0(i) The figure for this group of programmes in 1968-69 includes  604 million for investment grants, regional employment premiums and selective employment tax additional payments,which were not payable in the earlier years. The percentage changes in columns (e) and (./&apos;)for this group and for the total are calculated excluding these new expenditures.(ii) &quot;Relative price effect&quot; is the term used to refer to the allowance that needs to be madefor the fact that over a period of time a series of figures on a constant price basis will under-state the share of national resources which public expenditure pre-empts. For further details secAppendix III, paragraphs 11-15.Q) 1969-70 estimated outturn prices. By outturn (or current) prices is meant theactual prices at which expenditure was incurred, or is estimated to be incurred, duringthe year it /  question.(2) 1959-60 is the first year for which, comparable figures are available.
7. Defence expenditure, which had been reduced following the KoreanWar, was growing slowly in the early years up to 1964-65 at an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent.(:i) Civil expenditure had been on a rising trend in the years before 1959-60, and, with the exception of expenditure relating to commerce and industry, continued to rise rapidly between then and 1964-65. Withinenvironmental services, which as a whole rose in this period by an average of8.8 per cent each year, housing (10.7 per cent) and roads and transport (10.0per cent) rose particularly fast. Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure,notably that of the electricity and gas industries and the Post Office, alsoexpanded rapidly in this period, by 4.9 per cent per annum overall. Within thesocial services, education rose by 5.9 per cent, social security by 4.6 per cent and health and welfare by 3.3 per cent. Willhin fine group of programmesconcerned with commerce and industry, regional development policy wasbeginning and, with other policies for helping employment and industry,comprised a programme which was -growing in this period at about 12.9 percent a year on average.8. Between 1964-65 and 1968-69 changes of policy checked the increasein defence expenditure and by 1968-69 it was falling in real terms. In the civilsector, regional development policy progressed and there were new measuresto modernise and restructure industry. These were among the main develop-ments which made the group of programmes concerned with commerce andindustry grow faster in this period than any other group, at an average of 9.0per cent per annum. Emphasis was also shifted from environmental to social services where expenditure was increased by an average annual rate overallof 6.0 per cent, inoluding 4.9 per cent on education, 3.9 per cent on health and welfare and 8.3 per cent on social security. Nationalised industries&apos;capital expenditure rose more slowly, at an average of 2.3 per cent a yearoverall. This was mainly because capital expenditure by tlhe electricity industry rose more slowly and then turned downwards, while investment bythe coal industry and on the railways continued to decrease.9. The net effect of all these movements was to produce an average annual increase in total public expenditure between 1959-60 and 1964-65 of4.2 per cent, with expenditure rising in both the defence and the civil sectors;and between 1964-65 and 1968-69 an annual average increase of 5.9 per cent,with expenditure on defence beginning to fall but civil expenditure, panticu-larly on the social and economic services, rising faster than before. Over tlheperiod as a whole from 1959-60 to 1968-69, total public expenditure rose atan average annual rate of 5 per cent.Prospective growth of resources10. During the same period 1959-60 to 1968-69 total output (gross domestic product) rose on average by just over 3 per cent a year at constant(1963) prices. A rising labour force contributed about one half per cent a yearto the increase in output, the balance coming from increasing productivity.11. During the next few years, little change is expected in the size of theworking population, but in 1973 and 1974 the raising of the school-leaving the rates of increase given for particular programmes do not take account of therelative price effect. This is included in !he rates of increase given for public expenditure as a whole, and accounts for about i per cent per annum spread over the programmesother than the capital investment of the nationalised industries etc., and debt interest.
age will reduce the numbers of young people joining the work force. Thusrising output can only come from rising productivity. It seems that the.underlying rate of increase in productivity is now about 3 per cent a year or alittle less.12. &quot;The Task Ahead&quot; envisaged an increase of total output within a range of just under 3 per cent to about 4 per cent a year. In settling the levels of public expenditure over the next four years, the Government have basedtheir decisions on the assumption that the rate of growth of the nation&apos;resources will foe at the lower end of this range. They have made this assumption because they consider it wise to take a cautious view of theresources available. Despite the marked recent improvement in the country\overseas earnings, there remains the overriding need to make available asufficient share of these growing resources for maintaining an adequate sur-plus on the balance of payments and a higher level of private investment.But if experience were to show that a higher rate of growth could be achieved at the same time as the other objectives of the Governments economic policies, then it would become a matter for decision how far this additionaloutput should be used to expand public expenditure programmes or in otherways.The general prospect for public expenditure to 1971-7213. The prospect for public expenditure and receipts up to 1971-72 is summarised in Table l.2(&apos;). The figures are here presented in the newway explained in the Governments Green Paper of April, 1969(r&apos;).14.   The movement of total public expenditure is shown in line 14. Therates of increase between one year and the next from 1968-69 to 1971-72are 2.4 per cent, 3.5 per cent and 3.2 per cent, respectively an averageof 3.0 per cent for this period as a whole.15. The Government have in the past published limits(c) against whichall public expenditure was to be counted except the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries, and debt interest, though without adjustment for therelative price effect. Expressed at 1969 Survey prices these limits have been:  million1968-69 1969-70 1970-7116098 16256 16757The corresponding totals in this White Paper are within these limitsf), asfollows:  million1968-69 1969-70 1970-7115822 (provisional 16214 (estimate)    167.12 (estimate)outturn)(&apos;) Detailed analyses of the figures in Table 1.2 are given on pages 11-12 in Tables1.7-1.10 for each of the years 1968-69 to 1971-72, distinguishing expenditure, and receiptsalso, so far as this is relevant.(5) &quot;Public Expenditure: A New Presentation&quot; (cmnd.. 4017).

Mainly because line programmes in 1968-69 were so far within the target tosome extent expenditure provided for in the year was not actually met untilthe following year the actual increases between 1967-68 and 1969-70 arenow estimated at about 2\ per cent in each year, and between 1969-70 and1970-71 at about 3^ per cent.Detailed comparisons between the programme estimates for 1969-70 and1970-71 given in the While Paper &quot;Public Expenditure 1968-69 to 1970-71 &quot;(Cmnd. 3936) of last February and in this While Paper are shown in appendix ii.16. In Table 1.2 expenditure and receipts arc classified under three main headings Resources; Transfers, Taxation etc.; and Assets. The distributionof the contingency reserve, by its nature, cannot be forecast. It has beenarbitrarily included as a whole under Resources since its implications fordemand would be greatest, if it were all required for purchases of resources;but some of it might in Ihe event be required for expenditure on either of theother classes.17. Net expenditure on resources, which is the class having the most powerful effect on demand, is shown in line 3 to rise by 4 per cent per annum.Of this, about \ per cent is attributable to the contingency reserve and \\per cent to the relative price effect. Net expenditure on assets, the oate-gory which has the least impact on demand in the short term, is shown in line 11 to rise at an annual rate of a little under I per cent; but this is asmall element in the total. Expenditure on transfers is shown in lines 4 and5 as rising by about U per cent a year; but the figures will be affected by whatever decisions are eventually taken on the upraling of social security benefits in the period (see section 17 of Part 2 on social security).18. The receipts side of the table, unlike the expenditure side, showsprojections which do not represent explicit Government decisions. Changesin tax rales are among the main instruments for the short-term regulationof the economy; there may have to be modifications in the light of the situation as it develops from year to year and the Government cannot commit them-selves in advance. The projections of receipts are therefore based on certain assumptions. These may not in the event be realised; but they indicate the trend as it would be if no further changes were made in the system. thus the yield of taxes has been calculated on the assumptions that present taxrates and allowances will continue unchanged and that the gross national product will grow as postulated. Changes in tax rates which were made in theBudgets of 1968 and 1969 are, of course, allowed for. National insurance contributions are projected to rise so as to match, together with the exchequer supplement, the assumed growth of expenditure on benefits. Similarly, pro-jeotions of Income from local rates are related to projections of the expenditureof local authorities and assume that the existing system of grants to those authorities continues.(7) The composition of these totals is explained in Appendix lit, paragraph 17 on expenditure 1968-69 to 1970-71 &quot; (Cmnd. 3936).(n) &quot;Public Expenditure in 1968-69 and 1969-70&quot; (Cmnd. 3515) and &quot;Publicpage 00.
19. The average annual increase in total receipts over tihe period isestimated on these assumptions at 3] per cent. There is a large increase,of 91 per cent, in the yield of taxes between 1968-69 and 1969-70. shownin line 6; this results partly from budgetary changes which have already takenplace and partly from the growth of the economy. In the following year therate of increase still owes something to recent changes in lax rales. Thechange between 1970-71 and 1971-72 is put at about 3 per cent; this increase is not significantly influenced by past changes in tax rates.20. Line 15 shows the balance between total receipts and total expendi-ture. In the current financial year the public sector as a whole is forecast tohave a surplus of receipts over expenditure of over  500 million. In the paslthe public sector has normally had a deficit financed by borrowing. Thechange from a small public sector deficit in 1968-69 to a sizeable surplus in1969-70 has played an important part in creating itlhe financial conditionsaccessary for achieving a surplus on the balance of payments. The prospectis that at existing tax rates total receipts and total expenditure will be roughlyin balance during illhe following two yeans.21. A second balance is struck in line 10 by excluding transactions inassets (line 13) from total receipts and total expenditure. (Movements in this second balance - the balance of resources, transfers, taxation, etc. corisli-tute a better guide than the balance of total receipts and (total expenditure tothe impaot of public sector operations on real demand in the short term.This balance, too, shows a favourable swing of over  1,000 million betweenlast year and the current year. This improvement in the balance of public sector transactions (other than in assets) has contributed to the switch of resources info the balance of payments which [has already taken place. Itsmaintenance over the coming period will help to consolidate the improvementin our overseas position and to sot free resources lor a further increase in private linvestment.The prospect for public expenditure programmes up to 1971-7222. The plans for public expenditure programmes up to 1971-72 show a continuation of the same broad pattern as has been developing over recentyears. The real cost of defence will continue to fall as changes in defence policytake effect. At the same time the Government arc planning for an increase incivil programmes. Environmental and social services increase from 60 per cent of total public expenditure in 1968-69 to 62 per cent in 1971-72. But these developments are planned within a total of public expenditure which will be growing at an average annual rate of 3 per cent, compared with 5 pen- centin the llast decade.

The detail lying behind this summary is set out in the following table,which distinguishes 20 main programmes, most of which comprise a largenumber of individual projects or services. This classification brings togetherexpenditure of the various spending authorities Government, local authoritiesand public corporations other than nationalised industries which is directed to single broad objectives, c.g., education and housing. The public expenditureof Northern Ireland, and the capital expenditure of nationalised industries are brought together under single headings, and so is debt interest. Part 2 of this white Paper provides a commentary on each of the programmes.25. The Contingency Reserve, shown in this table in line 25 makes pro-vision for new expenditure which may have to be incurred but the precisenature, scale and timing of which cannot be foreseen. It is also needed to cover any excess over present estimates, in particular for programmes where expendi-ture is partly determined by factors not under the spending authority&apos;s owncontrol, and to provide an element of llcxibility should the economy notdevelop as is assumed in the plans. Since these uncertainties increase over time,provision has been made on an increasing scale26.   An analysis of the programmes by spending authority is given for eachof the four years in Tables 3.1-3.4 oh pages---. These tables distinguishthose elements of expenditure to toe incurred by the Government (showingVote-financed expenditure separately from that financed from the national insurance Funds and other special funds), by local authorities, and by public corporations, including, in addition to the nationalised industries, the broad-casting authorities, the new town corporations, and a number of otherindividual bodies.

As regards Government expenditure, the growth of current expenditure is mainly In social security (partly because of -recent increases in benefit, partly because of increased numbers), the National Health Service, agriculture (see-section 2.8, paragraphs 2 and 3), and the universities; and the growth in capitalexpenditure mainly in roads and transport, investment grants, hospitals,offices, computer centres and other Government buildings, and grants underthe overseas aid programme.29.   Local authorities are responsible for the greater part of expenditure,current and capital, on local environmental services (96 per cent), law andorder (81 per cent), and housing (79 per cent) that is, in nearly all the main programmes in the environmental services group which, with an average annual rate of-inorca.se of 4.7 per cent (see Table 1.3), is the group plannedlo grow most rapidly in the period. Within the social services group, localauthorities have the major part of expenditure in education (84 per cent).These various services, together with roads, are also individually the largestto be run by local authorities. Together they account for over 90 per cent oflocal authorities&apos; expenditure, 40 per cent of it going on education -alone.30. The figures quoted in Table 1.5 for the current expenditure of localauthorities differ from the figures of relevant expenditure on which rate support grant is paid in Great Britain in that the former indkide some items(mainly rate fund contributions to council house rents) which do not come(*) The aggregates of pub ic expenditure and the individual programmes for eachyear 1968-69 to 1971-72 are analysed in detail by economic category in tables 3.5 and 3.6on ruiges----.
wilhin &quot;relevant expenditure&quot;, but exclude loan charges and some other items which do; moreover Table 1.5 covers Northern Ireland, which is outsidethe Great Britain rate support grant settlements. The total of Great Britainrelevant expenditure to attract rale support grant in 1969-70 and ll)70-7l was determined last winter. For 1971-72 the elements of local authority relevant expenditure (other than loan charges&apos;) which are included in the programmesimply, when brought together, a growth of 4 per cent in real terms above (thetotal which was accepted for 1970-71 under the 1968 .raie support grant settle-mentally(&quot;). This is the rale of increase which the Government will regard as an acceptable basis for the next rate support grant determination: and theyconsider llhat the resources available to local authorities after such it deler-mination will enable them fully to achieve the programmes which tireembodied in this While Paper, including as the largest among theni theeducation programme.31. Capital expenditure by the nationalised industries reflects the chang-ing pattern of demand for the output of the industries concerned. The fastestrising (ami soon the biggest) individual programme is that of the Post Ollice, tomeet the rapid increase in demand for telecommunications services. The capitalexpenditure of the industries as a whole is exoecteel to fall slightly between1968-69 and 1971-72 as a result of a substantial reduction in capital expendl-Ilire by the electricity industry, which will more than ollsel rising expenditure by other industries.Public expenditure in 1972-73 and 1973-7432. The Government have not vet taken firm decisions on the levels forthe individual programmes in 1972-73 and 1973-74 but they tire resolved lokeep the total of public expenditure within the limits of the expected growth of the economy as a whole. In the following table there pre shown orovisioivtlallocations among the programmes of a Lota I of public expenditure whichrises by about 31 per cent in bollh years.33. All the figures in this (able tire provisional, and the margins ofestimation vary from one -programme to another. Oh the one hand, forexample, preferences to the Defence Budget and lo Overseas Aid, to be drafted after Ministers&apos; consideration]. On the other hand, for instance, fora number of programmes information is necessarily incomplete at this stage:the Technological Services programme will not he settled until much nearer the lime because new technological projects may come forward in the mean-while which should lie considered for places in the programme The amountsto foe spent on other assistance to emoiloymenl and industry will depend largely on the coarse of private investment attracting investment grants: andthose to be spent on support of agriculture will be set fed in successive annualFarm Price Reviews. Environmental and social services, except social security, involve large expenditures fov local authorities whose own decisionsmay affeol the amounts to be spent and their distribution between programmes.The course of expenditure on social security will foe mainly determined by theextent of the upralings.(&apos;-&apos;) For an explanation of lho financial arrangements between the Government andlocal authorities see Appendix I.

Renewed growth in capital expenditure by the nationalised industries is likely in 1972-73 and 1973-74 following four years in which there willhave been little change in the total of this expenditure. In a number of programmes, lor instance, telecommunications, there will be continuingincreases, and the level of capital expenditure by the electricity industry will begin to .risc again.35. Decisions on the pattern of expenditure in 1972-73 will be taken inncxl years annual review and embodied in the White Paper foil&apos; that year.A:t that time provisional allocations will again be made for 1973-74, and fora further year 1974-75. As the programmes are rolled forward ti 11 this wayeach year, and as calls arc made on the contingency reserve, changes arc tobe expected in the individual totals.

PART 2 THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMESPart 1 of this White Paper was concerned witli the general prospect for public expenditure. This &quot;Part supplements the broad analysis with more detailed explanation relating to the individual programmes. A number of suggestions put forward by the Select Committee on Procedure in the HuntReport have been taken into account.DEFENCE BUDGET  million table 2.1 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			Defence Budget	2,291-7	2,252-0	2,211-4	2,160-8In the period up to 1972 defence expenditure is being reduced as a resultof the policy changes which have been reported to Parliament in the annualStatements on Defence Estimates. The most important of these changes arethe reduction of defence commitments East of Suez and the winding up ofmilitary bases in South East Asia and the Persian Gulf. The savings in defence expenditure which will be achieved in consequence will not attaintheir full extent until 1972-73, bul the targets which have now been set forthe earlier years 1970-71 and 1971-72 reflect continuous efforts to ensurethat the new defence policy is carried out in the most efficient and econo-mical manner possible. Thus it has been found possible to reduce expendi-ture al a quicker rale than was envisaged in January 1968 when the currentpolicy was announced (Cmnd. 3515). In particular (he target lor the defence budget in 1970-71 is  76 million less than the estimate made in February1969 (Cmnd. 3936). Detailed information about (he Defence Budget for1970-71 and developments in defence plans will be reported to Parliament inthe 1970 Statement on Defence Estimates.OTHER MILITARY DEFENCE  million table 2.2 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			(a) Military aid	14-5	8-9	4-7	3 0(b) Allied services	790	81-4	81-9	79-5(c) United Slates military aircraft				(i) Purchases	110-6	38-5	320	4-3(ii) Repayments	-47-3	-43-1	-52-5	-54-767) Other (i)        ......	-10-5	-05	-0-6	-4-5Total      ......	146-3	85-2	65-5	27-6(i) This includes provision for national accounting adjustments and certain minor items.
Military aidI. This heading covers the provision of training courses in the UnitedKingdom for the service personnel of other countries, the provision of british service training teams on loan or secondment to developing countries (mainlymembers of the Commonwealth) and in some cases the cost of capital equip-ment, although this type of expenditure is being run down. A small amountof police training particularly in South East Asia is also included.Allied services . Under this heading the main items are accommodation for head-quarters staff, superannuation for civilian staff, stationery and recruitmentpublicity.United States military aircraft. Delivery of these aircraft will be completed during 1969-70 but sup-port costs and final settlements will extend through 1970-71 into 1971-720).OVERSEAS AID  million table 2.3 at outlurn prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimate(a) Aid programme (b) Other overseas aid	199 0 9-5	205 0 21-9	205 0 30-1	1  2510(c) Total Government expenditure on overseas aid (cl) Of which, aid which does not count towards the UNCTAD target        ......	208-5 2-8	226-9 7-5	235-1 7-5	2510 60(e) Total Government expenditure on overseas aid counting to-wards the UNCTAD (ii) target (line(c) minus(d)) (/) Other net investment by the Commonwealth    Devclop-ment Corporation (iii)	205-7 -2-5	219-4 -2-8	227-6 -1-2	2450(g) Total public expenditure on overseas aid (line (c) and line (0)........	2060	224-1	233-9	2510(i) See Appendix III, paragraph 7.

The United States Credits from whichthey are financed are treated as receipts in the national accounts,(ii) Repayments of the Credits and the interest thereon are charged to the defence budget when they occur; but since to include both these and the progress pay-menits in the total of public expenditure would involve double counting, theformer are offset by equal but negative entries in line c(ii).
1. Since 1967-68 there has been a basic aid programme of  205 million a year in cash terms (i.e. without adjustment for changes in money values)covering normal multilateral and bilateral aid and technical assistance. some special items of aid expenditure have been undertaken separately in addi-tion to this programme.2. Within the basic programme multilateral aid consists of contributions to the International Development Association, the United Nations Develop-ment Programme and other institutions such as the United Nations Children&apos;sFund, the World Food Programme and the Regional Development Banksfor Asia, Africa and Latin America. Bilateral aid by way of grants and loansgoes mainly to Commonwealth countries and takes a variety of forms in-cluding aid for development projects, assistance towards a general import programme, balance of payments support (sometimes Including debt relief)and for a few countries and on a declining scale, budgetary aid to maintainminimum services. Technical assistance is given to a great many developing countries in the form of skilled people to fill executive and advisory appoint-ments, and also by way of consultancies and research and training in theUnited Kingdom and overseas. As opportunity offers Government policy isto increase the proportion of aid given multilaterally and in the form of tech-nical assistance. For 1970-71 planned expenditure within the basic aid pro-gramme is as follows:  Bilateral grants and loansCommonwealth and Dependencies  102 millionForeign  12 millionMultilateral contributions  30 millionTechnical assistance  40 millionCommonwealth Development Corporation  11 millionContingency reserve  10 million the figures shown above for the Commonwealth Development Corporationrepresent gross advances by the Ministry of Overseas Development. an adjustment, which may be positive or negative, is made (see line (f) in Table2.3) to take account of the Corporation^ net investment with other funds andthus to show the effect of Its transactions as a whole on United Kingdomresources.3. Of the special items additional to the basic aid programme thelargest is the  75 million of economic aid to Singapore and Malaysia which isbeing provided over five years from 1968-69 to mitigate the effects of theUnited Kingdom military withdrawal. There is also provision for an extra  7 million annually for three years ending in 1971-72 towards the increased UnitedKingdom contribution to the Second Replenishment of the funds of the Inter-national Development Association, and three annual contributions of  million from 1968 under the Rome Food Aid Convention.4. In 1968 the Government joined with the governments of other western countries who provide aid in accepting a recommendation of the SecondUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) thatdeveloped countries should endeavour to reach a target of 1 per cent of gross national product at market prices for financial flows to developing countries
comprising Governmental aid, private investment and guaranteed export credits, all net of capital repayments. No date for implementation was given and the United Kingdom&apos;s acceptance of the recommendation was subject to balance of payments considerations. All of the present overseas aid expenditurecounts towards the target except that part of tihe special aid to Singapore and malaysia which may be used to purchase defence equipment.5. The basic programme of  205 million a year and the additional itemswill continue in 1969-70 and 1970-71, producing total aid expenditure of 227 million and  235 million in cash terms in these years, of which about 219 million and  228 million (gross) is expected to count towards theUNCTAD target. For 1971-72, In order to make a move towards theUNCTAD target, the Government has decided to increase gross aid expendi-ture counting towards the UNCTAD target to  245 million in cash terms,and total aid expenditure accordingly to  251 million. From that year aidexpenditure will be treated as one comprehensive programme, providing forall Items of development assistance.OTHER OVERSEAS SERVICES  million table 2.4 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			Overseas representation	600	61-2	61-4	62-9Overseas information	28-3	30-7	30-2	29-other external relations	39-5	35-3	32-4	32-7Total......	127-8	127-2	1240	125-21. The expenditure on &quot;Other Overseas Services&quot; shows no significanttrend from 1969/70. Part of the expenditure is governed by internationalcominitments and the Report of the Duncan Committeef2), whose recommen-dations are under consideration by the Government, bears on the remainder.Overseas representation2. Almost all of this expenditure is required to meet the cost of the diplomatic Service, its accommodation and associated expenses in represent-ing British interests internationally.Overseas information.  This covers three main elements.(a) British Council expenditure to promote a wider knowledge of theUnited Kingdom and the English language abroad and to developcloser cultural relations between the United Kingdom and othercountries. (Pant of the Councils expenditure is also shown in Table2.3, Overseas aid.)(ib) The cost of the B.B.C.&apos;s (External Services and associated expenditure involved in broadcasting news and views to other countries; and(c) The cost of staff at posts overseas involved in political and commercialinformation work and of the supporting services of the Central Officeof Information and the Stationery Office.
Other external relations4. This expenditure mainly comprises international commitments andsubscriptions, including the United KingdotrTs assessed contributions to thebudgets of the United Nations Organisation and tihe Organisation for economic Co-operation and Development.TECHNOLOGICAL SERVICES  million table 2.5 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			Category 1:				Technological support programme:				Headquarters (Civil)	5-6	60	6 1	6-1Government research and				development	67-4	71 0	70-9	66-8Direct support for industrial				technology	150	19-5	20.5	25-3Total Category 1	880	96-5	97-5	98-2Category 11:				Other Civil Technology:				Aircraft projects and assistance. .	83-2	87-6	790	6.5-other      ........	18-7	17-6	35 1	19-7Allowance for new schemes	 	3 0	140	240Total Category II	101-9	108-2	128-1	109 grand Total......	189-9	204-7	225-6	207-2I. The Ministry of Technology\s civil expenditure on technological scr-vices is divided into two categories for the control of expenditure:Category I covers activities which by their nature are amenable to some flexibility in detailed financial management from year to year, and can thus be programmed ahead with reasonable assurance within an overall alloca-tion of finance.Category II covers major schemes of financial assistance lo industry, andcertain expenditure of the Atomic Energy Authority, which by their nature are not amenable to flexibility in financial management, and for. which, subject to major changes in policy, finance has to be provided fortihe whole period of each project. Some general provision lias also beenmade for new projects.Government research and development2. The industrial research establishments work for Government deparl-ments, for other public authorities and in support of industry. The total net expenditure of the multi-purpose establishments (the National Physical Lab-oratory, National Engineering Laboratory and Warren Spring Laboratory) isexpected to remain at its present level. A small increase is expected at theother, more specialised establishments to meet growing demands upon them.All the establishments are being encouraged to expand work which is directly related to specific needs in industry, particularly work on repayment.   A
proportion of the cost of the Ministry&apos;s aviation research and development establishments and of aerospace research In industry allocated to this headingbecause of the value of this work to civil industry. Total net expenditure on civil research and development by the Atomic Energy Authority will graduallydecline. Within this total, more work is being done at the Authority^establishments in support of non-nuclear industry. Within the nuclear field the main emphasis is now on the fast reactor.Direct support lor industrial technology3. Increasing provision is planned for support of the engineering indusi-ries and for productivity and information services, which benefit a wide range of industries. The work of the National Research Development corporation on the exploitation of inventions made in Government estahlish-ments and by the Research Councils, and in helping to finance research anddevelopment projects in industry, will be fully maintained. A ceiling has beenplaced on the total of grants to the industrial research associations; adjust-ments of annual grants to individual associations are being made within thetotal in accordance with the priority of their needs as grant agreements come up for reassessment.OTHER ASSISTANCE TO EMPLOYMENT AND INDUSTRY  million table 2.6 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			Assistance to persons				Employment services	600	68-5	730	75-3Redundancy fund payments	520	41-3	37 1	37 1Total......	112 0	109-8	110-1	112-4Promotion of local employment				Gross	55-7	73-1	82-7	89-3Loan repayments, rent and sales	-17-2	-18-4	-23-2	-26- net......	38-5	54-7	59-5	63 IIndustrial Reorganisation				Corporation	34-0	460	340	180Other specific grants and loans to				industry (trade, exports, tourism,				etc.				Gross	30-1	27-9	33-9	33-3Repayments	-181	-7-4	-40	-0-5Net     ......	120	20-5	29-9	32-8Investment Grants	448-4	5300	5200	5540S.E.T.

Category II4. The heading &quot; Aircraft projects and assistance &quot; covers expenditure onthe development, proving and production of civil aircraft including the UK.share of the Concorde project. The heading &quot; Other &quot; includes the UK con-tribution to international space programmes; assistance to the shipbuilding industry; other major industrial support schemes; capital expenditure on major reactor projects and trading and other expenditure of the Atomic energy authority. Whilst a demand for new schemes can be foreseen, the precisetiming and scale of expenditure is uncertain.Assistance to personsI. Expenditure on employment services consists of the expenditure ofthe Department of Employment and Productivity and the expenditure of localauthorities on services (including the youth employment service) for which theDepartment makes grants. The main elements are Departmental admini-strative costs (including employment exchanges. Government training centres and the factory inspectorate), and training and rehabilitation schemes, and services for the seriously disabled. Provision is made in the programme forthe further development of the placing and advisory services, both for adultsand young persons; a higher level of assistance towards industrial training,especially in development and intermediate areas; the continued expansionof Government training centres (to about 13,000 places by the end of 1972-73)and the introduction of an employment medical advisory service.2. The estimates for the Redundancy Fund from 1969-70 onwards take into account the effect of the Redundancy Rebates Act 1969 in reducing therebates payable to employers from the Fund.Promotion of local employment. Expenditure on the promotion of local employment consists of loans and grants by the Ministry of Technology to firms which provide additional employment in the development areas, and the cost of the building of fac-tories and development of industrial estates by the Ministry of Technologyitself. Gross expenditure in 1969-70 is expected to be  17.4 million higherthan in 1968-69. The demand for loan finance and (to a smaller extent) thenumber of large projects going to the development areas have both increased.Expenditure will continue to rise, largely as a result of the Governmentsdecisions on assistance to the intermediate areas, but the increase will be tosome extent offset by increasing receipts from rents and sales.Industrial Reorganisation Corporation4. The functions of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) areto promote industrial reorganisation and development in the general interestof the economy. Its main sources of capital are loans from the National loans fund and Public Dividend Capital from a Vote of the Minister of Technology;the Corporation pays interest on the former, and is to make periodic payments of dividend on the latter. The Corporation has made a first dividend pay-ment of  750,000 gross for 1968-69.5. Under the Industrial (Reorganisation Corporation Act 1966, a limit of 150 million was set to the aggregate of the public funds available to the 1958-59.
The nature of the IRCs operations, which include support for industrialmergers, the outcome of which depends on the course of commercial nego-tiations makes it difficult to programme its expenditure in advance. In the longer-run, the Corporation is expected to rely heavily on revolving its existing capital as a means of re-financing itself, but it will lake some years to build upannual repayments.6. For these reasons, the estimates in Table 2.6 of the annual phasing of lending by the ilRC are tentative. They show the final  18 million of the 150 million made available by the Government under existing legislation asbeing lent in 1971-72. The Table does not anticipate future legislation byshowing any lending in excess of the  150 million. But the Government intend to enable the 1958-59 to maintain approximately its current level of operationsbeyond that date, and to introduce legislation in due course to increase theexisting limit of  150 million. Decisions on the timing of the legislation, onthe increase in the limit and on the phasing of drawings against the new limitwill be taken nearer the lime, in the light of the actual course of the IRCsfinancial operations. Any expenditure beyond the present  150 million ceilingwill be a claim on the contingency reserve.Other specific grants and loans to industry7. This heading covers Board of Trade services on the promotion oftrade and exports, including expenditure by the Tourist Boards set up underthe Development of Tourism Act 1969; expenditure on the new hotel loans and grants scheme (which is expected to rise to a peak of about  8.5 million in 1971-72); grants to the British National Export Council; expenditure on trade fairs; and loans by the National Film Finance Corporation. It also includes loans of  31.1 million over the years 1969 to 1971 to the aluminiumsmelting companies, for which the Ministry of Technology is now responsible.Investment grants8. The (figures for investment grants assume that payment in each year will be in respect of four quarters&apos; investment expenditure, and that thestandard rate of grant will remain at 20 per cent, and the development arearate at 40 per cent. The figures lake account of the latest evidence on the trend in capital investment by industry, the proportion of it that will be eligible for investment grant, and the proportion of it that will attract thehigher development area rate of grant. Forecasts of this expenditure havebeen unavoidably uncertain as it depends not only on the way in which these factors develop but also on the timing of applications for ignant. It is now clear that substantial additional grant expenditure will be required in 1969-70,as compared with previous estimates, and the present figure for that yearincluded in Table 2.6 allows for the further provision Which, pending a finalappraisal, will be proposed in a Winter Supplementary Estimate.9. It is also clear that some of these factors will require a higher levelof grant expenditure than had previously been forecast in 1970-71 and 1971-72 also. One factor in this revision of estimates is the experienced gained asto the proportion of industrial investment which is eligible for grant at thenational and Development Area rates of grant under the terms of the scheme.Another is the higher rate of growth in certain categories of capital expendi-
lure. Allowance has now been made for ihese factors in the figures for 1971-72, though the revised forecasts remain subject lo variation.10. While the growth in productive investment which the grant schemewas designed to stimulate is to be welcomed, this additional grant expendi-ture has entailed a substantial charge on the contingency reserve, which mustmilitate strongly against further measures to increase or accelerate the flow of grant payments to industry in present circumstances, hi the longer termaccount will have to be taken of current studies on the relative cost effective-ness of the scheme.SET additional payments and regional employment premiumsII. The bulk of additional payments under the selective employmentlax (SET) arrangements and regional employment premiums are paid by theDepartment of Employment and Productivity lo qualifying -private employers in the development areas. A relatively small amount is paid by other Depart-ments lo nationalised industries in respect of those parts of their undertakings which qualify in the development areas. SET additional payments are beingabolished with effect from I April 1970 but because payment is made inarrears some provision is necessary in 1970-71 and for belated claims, again in 1971-72. The regional employment premium will continue to be paid.Board of Trade and Ministry of Technology services12. The administrative expenses of the Board of Trade on their services to industry and trade, and (hose of the Ministry of Technology on investment grants, promotion of local employment and some other services, come underthis heading.Assistance to coal industry.13. Under the Coal industry Act 1967 measures to alleviate social hard-ship are due to end in -March 1971, although some expenditure will spillover into 1972 and 1973. It was announced in the Queen&apos;s Speech that a bill will be introduced to continue alter March 1971 the Governments powers under the 1967 Act. The estimate of  18.8 million lor 1971-72 in Table 2.6takes account of this new commilmenl.RESEARCH COUNCILS, ETC.  million table 2.7 al 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimate(a) Research Councils (other than Social Science) etc. (/)) Agricultural research, Scotland ((.&apos;) Social Science Research Council	86-0 2-4 1-6	92-5 2-7 2-4	98-8 3-0 3-3	104-0 3-3 4-0Total......	900	97-6	105-1	111-3I.

The Councils are responsible for encouraging and supporting funda-mental and applied research in their own establishments, in units which theysupport at universities, and by bodies to which they make grants. They sup-port university research by grants to research workers and iby awards to post-graduates for research training and for advanced courses in science and tech-nology. Grants for scientific purposes, including international fellowships,are given to the Royal Society and to the Royal Society, Edinburgh.3. The science budget also covers subscriptions to international scientificbodies. In 1969-70 these amount to  1.2.2 million. The Science Research Coun-cil is responsible for United Kingdom contributions to the European space research Organisation (ESRO), the European Organisation for Nuclear Re-search (CERN) and to the NATO Scientific Research and Training Pro-gramme; the Medical Research Council for the contribution to the Inter-national Agency for Research on Cancer; and the Department of education and Science for that to the European Molecular Biology Conference.4. The main fields of research covered by the Councils are plants, ani-mals, food and agricultural engineering (ARC); biological, clinical and tropi-cal medicine research (iMRC); geology, hydrology, oceanography, marine bio-logy, fisheries and conservation (NERC); astronomy, space and radio nuclearphysics, engineering, chemistry and sciences not covered by the other Coun-cils (SRC). The Council for Scientific Policy and the individual Councils have encouraged research which, especially in the longer term, has potential eco-nomic value; for example, research relating to animals and crops; minerals;and polymers and enzymes.
5. Within the held of agricultural research a number of Institutes inScotland tire financed separately on Scottish voles til though their programmes of research are co-ordinated with ihc Agricultural Research Council.6.

This expenditure covers Ihe implementation of I lie price guarantees,the provision of grants and subsidies to farmers, and the associated adniiui-strative costs. There tire special difficulties about forecasting 1 lie future coslof agricultural support. The levels of the guarantees and subsidies will healTecled by changes made at future Farm Price Reviews. But, even if therewere no changes in guaranteed prices, Ihe cosl of implementing the guaranteeswould be liable to marked variations according to the levels of supply and of market prices. The figures for agricultural support have therefore been prc-.pared on Ihe following conventional basis, and do not attempt to predict futurevariations.3. The figures for 196^-70 correspond lo the Eslimales for Ihe year as submitted lo Parliament before Ihe 1969 Price Review, adjusted lo lakeaccount of the estimated effect of that Review in thai financial year. Thefigures for 1970-71 and subsequent years hike account of Ihe cslinialed full-year effects of. the 1969 Price Review but, in most oilier respects, project anunchanged figure for agricultural support. In pruclicc, Ihe cosl of agricultural support may result hi higher or lower expend Mure than tihe figures in Table2.8, depending on the factors described above.Oilier assistance lo agriculture4. This includes the bulk of Ihe remainder of Ihe expenditure of MAITand DAFS on agricultural and horticultural services, and administrative costs;
il includes the advisory services. Here again, as with agricultural support,some expenditure has been estimated on a conventional basis with no attemptto predict future variations, e.g. stabilising payments to the bacon curingindustry, animal disease compensation, payments tinder the Anglo-Irish free trade Agreement. The increase over the forecast period is due mainly to thedevelopment of policies under the Agriculture Act l%7 in respect of farmamalgamations and rural development policy, and to the modernisation of wholesale horticultural markets.Fisheries5. This estimate reflects the higher level of support for the industryauthorised by the Sea Fisheries Act 1968. The amount of support provided from year to year cannot, however, be forecast with accuracy because ildepends on operating results and in the case of the inshore fleet on decisions taken by Ministers in an annual review. As part of the Governments supportpolicy lor the industry provision has also been made lor a higher level ofexpenditure on grants and loans for vessels and equipment.Forestry6. The estimate covers support for -private and stale forestry. The period will see an expansion in the Forestry Commissions planting programme,particularly in Scotland.ROADS AND PUBLIC LIGHTING  million table 2.9 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional out 1 urn	estimate	eslimalc	esliniiileNew const met ion a ncl improvements				Major roads	302-2	342-0	377-5	415-3Oilier roads	50-8	43-2	46-1	50-1Oilier expenditure				(including lighting)	181	21-2	25-9	29-5Total	3711	406-4	449-5	494-maintenance				; Major roads	49-5	52-8	56-7	61 other roads	11 1-7	98-0	106-3	116-other expenditure				(including lighting)	21-3	21-9	23-1	27-0Total	182-5	172-7	1861	204-1Administration				Central government				administration	4-3	4-0	4-2	4-local authority administration . .	36-0	29-1	33-5	36-7Selective Employment Tax paid				by local authorities	16-3	17-1	17-4	17-8Grand total	610-2	629-3	690-7	757-8
1. Table 2.9 covers expenditure by the Government and by local autihori-ties. Government whoHy finances :t&apos;he construction, improvement, maintenance and lighting of trunk roads (motorways and all-purpose roads) and makesspecific grants (normally 75 per cent) -towards the cost of constructing and improving principal roads. All other expenditure (including maintenance andlighting of principal and non-principal roads, as well as improvement of non-principal roads) is a local responsibility.2. The number of vehicles using the roads continues to rise by about 5 percent every year and it is estimated that by the end of 1971-72 nearly half the5,400 miles of trunk roads will be very heavily loaded. Urban traffic is alsosteadily increasing. These factors call for an expanding programme of roadexpenditure.3. Continuing improvements to routes which carry the bulk of the traffic and the relief of urban congestion are essential lo promote the economic and social well-being not only of the individual regions but of the country as awhole.4. The planning, design and construction of major road schemes can takeseven years or more so that decisions on policy are of a long-term nature.Current land use and transportation studies will establish the framework for future public investment in urban road and traffic management schemes. the green Paper &quot; Roads for the Future,&quot; published in March 1969, with its new approach to inter-urban road planning, seeks to establish guidelines into tihe1980s. Similarly, in Scotland and Wales future plans -have been drawn up afterconsultation with the interests affected, giving emphasis to the importance of roads in promoting regional developments see &quot; The Scottish Economy,1965-70&quot; (Cmnd. 2864), &quot;Scottish Roads in the 1970s&quot; (Cmnd. 3953), and&quot; Wales, The Way Ahead &quot; (Cmnd. 3334).5. Other expenditure includes provision for research and development which will rellect the expansion of work on road building and the greater emphasis being put on road traffic and transportation. More use will be madeof extra-mural research contracts particularly with industry.6. Local authority expenditure on improvement and maintenance of roads (other than principal roads), lighting and car-parks is expected to riseslightly as a result of some relaxation of the restrictions imposed in 1968-69and 1969-70. This expenditure is assisted through the rate support grant but is not directly subject to central control.

Table 2.10 covers the main elements of Transport expenditure exclud-ing expenditure on roads, which is covered in Table 2.9.2. The largest element in the programme is grants to British Rail for themaintenance of tin remit iterative railway passenger services. [However, expendi-ture of aboul  62 million in 1969 on these will &apos;be gradually reduced asmeasures arc -taken to increase operating efficiency and to close down some services which represent poor value for money. It is also expected that therewill ibe some assumption of financial responsibility by local communities for services which they wish to maintain in their areas.3. Another large element in Government support for British Rail is the grants which are being paid for a limited period as an incentive to the elimination -tiori by the Board of surplus track and signalling capacity. This surplus capa-city cannot be eliminated overnight and a live-year programme has beenagreed, now well under way, for its gradual disposal. Again, these grants will gradually taper away, from  15 million in 1969 to  5 million in 1973 after which they will cease.4. A similar system of tapering grants has been instituted in respect ofunprofitable activities which the National Freight Corporation (NFC) lookover from British Rail relating to rail freight sundries. The Transport Act1968 enables grants to be made to the NFC of up to  60 million in all towards -their losses in this respect in the live years 1969 to 1973, and it is intendedto run clown the grants from the opening level of  17 million to a fraction of that amount in 1973, if the losses have not been eliminated by then.5.   The main element of the Transport programme outside the nationalised
industries is port investment, which is put at about  40 million for each of theyears 1970-71 and 1971-72, based on estimates provided by individual port authorities adjusted in the light of recent experience. In the longer term portinvestment will depend in the main on the policies of the proposed NationalPort Authority announced in the White Paper on the Re-organisation of the ports (Cmnd. 3903). This Authority will control the major ports of the country which handle about nine-tenths of seaborne trade of the United Kingdom andwill be responsible for reviewing the investment plans for these ports. But thisis unlikely to affect the pattern of investment much before 1973-74.6. The Government intend to continue their substantial support of busoperators through the rebate of bus fuel duty, estimated at about  21-^ million in 1970-71 and 1971-72. In addition bus operators are expected to receiveabout  8] million each year through the new bus grant scheme introduced bythe Government. Local authorities who make grants for rural bus and ferryservices will receive a 50 per cent contribution from the Government.7. Other major expenditure on public transport will arise from the schemeintroduced by the Government to allow grants to be paid to public authoritiesin respect of expenditure on infrastructure projects which assist the develop-ment of urban passenger transport facilities. Expenditure for this purpose islikely to rise from about  5^ million in 1968-69 to about  12 million in 1970-71and to some  24-&apos; million in 1971-72. The increase in these expenditures reflectsa growing appreciation of the important role of public transport in producingpractical and acceptable solutions to urban transport problems.8. From I January 1970 onwards the figures for &quot; other passenger trans-port &quot; include expenditure by the Greater London Council on London Trans-port, which for earlier periods is included with the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries (Table 2.22).9. Expenditure on road safety and research is increasing and giving agood return in social and economic terms. In particular road safety publicity and road user training is helping to maintain the improvement in road casualtyfigures which occurred towards the end of 1967.10. Civil aviation and shipping services cover expenditure at aerodromesoperated by the Board of Trade, on air navigation and miscellaneous services provided by the Board, capital expenditure by local authorities at municipalaerodromes. Board of Trade expenditure on shipping services and net loans tothe shipping industry.HOUSING  million table 2.11 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimateInvestment and improvements in-cluding  grants  to the private sector and mortgage lending (net) Subsidies	862-2 232-7	802-7 270-0	828-3 312-8	862-4 339-4Total    ..      ..	1,094-9	1,072-7	1,141 1	1,201-8
1. The figures sot out above are broken clown into investment in newdwellings together with improvements and net mortgage lending on the onehand and subsidies on the other. The estimates of expenditure on housing in-vestmcnl in the public sector and improvement grants and mortgage ad-vances to the private sector reflect action taken to increase or improve I hehousing stock both public and private. The figures for subsidies do not beara similar relationship to work done in the years in question, though theyare an essential feature of housing policies. These latter figures, as well asthose for mortgage advances, are on an outturn prices basis, because ol theproblems which arise in adjusting them lo constant prices. (&apos;)investment and improvements2. The larger element in these figures represents lhe capital expenditure(mainly financed out of borrowing) on public sector housing by local authori-lies and new town corporations. It embraces new house building, the acquisi-lion of slums for clearance or old houses for improvement, and improvements to the public sector housing stock. A smaller element consists of payments ofimprovement grants to the private sector.3. These estimates are on the basis (hat approvals of new housebuildingin the public sector in Great Britain will continue at or about their present level hut with some shift Of emphasis from new construction to the rehabilitation-lation of older houses following the Housing Act of 1969. In England, the135 priority authorities with the worst housing problems of over-crowdingand slum clearance will continue to be allowed to build lo capacity, and else-where priority will be given lo the replacement of slums, overspill and hous-ing for old people. In Scotland and Wales provision has been made lo meelthe continuing need for new houses to replace shuns, lo provide for economic growth, and lo overcome local shortages and maldistribution of I he existinghousing slock.4. The estimates also include Ihe ncl cost (idler taking account of repay-ments received by local authorities in discharge of previous loans) of morl-gagc lending by local authorities to private persons and housing associations,New advances by local authorities in 1969-70 will be at the  55 million level for England and Wales announced in July 1969 and Ihe same ligtire has been included in Ihc 1971-72 estimate; this item, however, can be varied more readily than others -and the Government have already announced thai the ceil-ireg on new advances by locail authorities in 1970-71 will be increased by 45 million: the figures take this into account.Subsidies5. The subsidy figures in these estimates comprise two elements. The first,and larger, represents subsidy payments by Ihc central government to localauthorities. These payments tire made tinder a scries of Acts, the most recentof which is the Housing Subsidies Act 1967. Under this Act (and (he equiva-lent legislation in Scotland) subsidies are directed towards the cost of interest on loans raised by local authorities to finance approved building programmes and are designed to bridge the gap between a 4 per cent interest ride and representative -actual rates of interest. The smaller clement consists of contri-bulions from the local authorities&apos; General Rate Funds to lower ihe level of rents charged.(/&apos;) Sec Appendix III, paragraph 7.

The heading Mocal environmental services&apos; covers a wide variety of services which arc almost entirely the responsibility of local authorities. Theycan be divided broadly into the three groups shown under &quot;Capital expendi-ture&apos; in the table above. In so far its capital expenditure by local authorities is financed by borrowing it requires loan sanction from the central govcrn-mentally.2. The first group, which covers basic and essential services, is con-ccrncd with public health and the reduction or removal of pollution. Jt in-cludes water supply, sewerage and refuse disposal, miscellaneous public healthexpenditure and clean air policy. The pressure for increased expenditure onthese services is considerable. Industrial growth, increase in population and improved standards of living create an inescapable and rapidly rising demandfor water, sewerage and refuse disposal. As the scale of these services increases the technical problems also increase and they become more costly. Far in-slance, the rising demand for water involves getting supplies from less acccs-sible sources. It also involves a higher standard of purification of the effluentsdischarged into rivers, which in turn means that the replacement of over-loaded, out-dated and inefficient sewage purification plant becomes increas-ingly urgent. On refuse disposal, the growing shortage of convenient places for lipping requires increased expenditure on incinerators, plant and vehicles.3. The second group comprises a variety of services lor the improvc-ment of the environment. It includes playing fields and swimming batihs andother recreational areas such as country parks, as well -its expenditure ontown and country planning, which is primarily the redevelopment of centralurban areas but also the reclamation of derelict land. The administrative costs of local authorities, expenditure on local authority offices and on computersalso come in here. Despite the strong case for expenditure on this group of services, tfiey are generally less urgently required than the first group, andexpenditure on them is expected in total to be kept roughly level in orderto allow room for the extra growth required for the -first group.
4. The third group comprises direct expenditure by new town develop-ment corporations mainly on industrial and commercial development. other public expenditure on new towns is grouped with the main programmessuch as roads and housing (water and sewerage for new towns fall within thefirst group of local environmental services). The figures for this group showsome growth as the work on the more recent of them gathers momentum,on new towns show some growth reflecting the build-up of expenditure onthe recent generation of new towns.5. Similar considerations apply to current expenditure. The figures hereare only an estimate of what local authorities in aggregate will spend and a detailed sub-division is not attempted.LAW AND ORDER ARTS  million table 2.13 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimateCapital expenditure:				Home Departments&apos; services				(i) Police	21-0	25-7	28-1	32-8(ii) Prisons	90	10-5	12-5	17-2(iii) Probation and after care	0-5	0-3	0-3	0-4(iv) Child care......	4-6	4-2	5-5	6-0(v) Fire services	9-5	10-6	11-2	11-8(vi) Other services	0-3	3-9	5 1	3-5Total........	44-9	55-2	62-7	71-law Courts, etc.	6-3	4-9	6-9	8-4Total (capital expenditure)	51-2	60-1	69-6	80-current expenditure:				Home Departments&apos; services:				(i) Police	258-4	274-2	289-3	304-6(ii) Prisons	37-9	40-3	43-8	45-4(iii) Probation and aftercare..	9-8	11-4	121	12-9(iv) Child care......	54-9	60-0	63-4	66-9(v) Fire services	57-2	57-3	58-4	60-5(vi) Other services	3-3	5-9	8 1	9-7(vii) Departmental				administration	10-3	11-3	12-4	12-8Total........	431-8	460-4	487-5	512-8Law courts, etc.	35 0	34-8	361	38-3Legal aid	12-6	12-7	13-3	14-0Parliament and the Privy Council	6-5	6-8	6-9	7-0Parliamentary election expenses	0-1	0-3	2-1	0-3SET paid by local authorities   ..	21-0	19-5	19-8	20-2Total (current expenditure) Grand total........	507-0	534-5	565-7	592-6	558-2	594-6	635-3	672-71. Most expenditure on law and order services is governed by social anddemographic considerations such as the levels of crime and traffic, the numberof prisoners, the needs of children in public care and the growth of fire risks and in the incidence of fires. The load which all these impose is increasing
and, despite improvements in methods, organisation and equipment, calls for more expenditure, especially on staff in the services concerned. Most of theexpenditure is incurred by local authorities; the central government contributeby way of the rate support grant, and for certain services (notably the police)by specific grants.Police2. The forecasts assume increases in police and civilian strengths (includ-ing traffic wardens).Prisons3. It is assumed that the prison population will continue to rise (fromnearly 39,000 at the beginning of the period); that there will be a progressiveincrease of staff to deal with the increased population and new establishments;and that capital provision will be made for new prison places to relieve over-crowding and to carry forward the long overdue modernisation of existingprison buildings.Probation and after-care4. The estimated increase in expenditure is mainly the result of anexpected increase in the number of probation officers. Provision is also madefor an annual increase in the number of places in voluntary after-care hostels.Child care5. Expenditure arising from the implementation of the Children and young Persons Act 1969 will be first felt in 1970-71. Provision is made for increases in the number of children cared for, in staff, and in the costs of main-taining children in residential establishments.Fire services. Provision is made for a moderate increase in the numbers of full-timefiremen together with proportionate increases in supporting civilian staffs.Law courts and legal aid7. Expenditure is expected to rise because of the continuing increase in thework load of the courts and the extension of the fixed penalty system(&apos;). the forecasts for both civil and criminal legal aid assume that the number of cases in which legal aid is obtained will continue to rise.Other services. Most of the increase in expenditure is attributable to the urban pro-gramme, a new programme of expenditure on community services in areas ofspecial social need. This programme also provides the funds for the communitydevelopment project, which is an experimental project to evaluate the social and community services in a limited number of deprived areas and to consider how to make these services more effective. Increases in expenditure also arise(*) The projected expenditure on law courts -includes no extra provision for the imple-mentation of itihe Report of the Royal Commission on Assizes and Quarter Sessions.
from the criminal injuries compensation scheme as a result of a continued risewhich is expected in the number of applications.9.

Table 2.15 above shows details of expenditure on education and locallibrary services in the period 1969-70 to 1971-72. In 1968-69 this expenditure was over  2,200 million equivalent to more than 6 per cent of the size of the gross national product and local authorities, with the help of rate support grant, spent more than 80 per cent of it. These services employ well over one million people, half of them teachers.2. This expenditure covers the complete range of provision from nursery education to computers for university research. The main determinant of thegrowth in expenditure is the increase in numbers of pupils and students at every level. Between 1968-69 and 1971-72 total numbers in schools will rise byabout 7 per cent in primary schools by 6 per cent from 5.34 million to 5.66million and in secondary schools by over 9 per cent from 3.33 million to 3.63million. Expenditure incurred to meet these increases needs to be planned wellin advance; major decisions on educational expenditure generally have their main effect on the education service in the period roughly four to eight yearslater.
3. There will be a further large increase in numbers in secondary schoolsfrom the beginning of 1973 following the raising of the school leaving age. TheGovernment has authorised new building work worth  120 million for thispurpose. This and other capital expenditure on secondary schools will helpreorganisation on comprehensive lines.4. Numbers of students (full-time equivalents) in further and higher education as a whole, which embraces the range from part-time day releasecourses to work at postgraduate level, are expected to rise by over 10 per cent between 1968-69 and 1971-72. Universities and colleges of education andfurther education will continue to expand accordingly. -Between 1967 and1971 the proportion of the age-group entering full-time and sandwich courses in higher education is expected to rise from 14 per cent to about 20 per cent.This expansion and the corresponding contribution from part-time studentswill increase the flow of highly qualified manpower to the economy.5. To maintain standards of provision for rising numbers current expcndi-ture on schools must rise over the period to 1971-72 by about 8 per cent andon post-school education by rather more than 10 per cent. Table 2.15 showsthat current expenditure on primary and secondary schools is expected lo riseby II per cent and on further and higher education by 15 per cent. Somemargin of expenditure is therefore available for the improvement of standards.6. In the schools, the number of qualified teachers available is expectedto rise by 15 per cent between 1968-69 and 1971-72, about twice the rale of increase expected in the number of pupils. This will make possible a continuedreduction in the number of over-large classes, especially in primary schools, a major objective of education policy. Resources will also continue to be madeavailable for the replacement of some old school and university buildings andlo improve facilities in colleges of education and further education, particu-larly at the polytechnics.7. The range of the education services will be widened when the OpenUniversity&apos;s first courses begin in January 1971. Nursery education in sociallydeprived areas will benefit under the Urban Programme^), and there will be a steady growth in expenditure on sport, the youth service, adult education andpublic libraries.(c) See Section 2.13, paragraph 8.

About 60 psr cent of this expenditure is on hospitals, 22 per centon general practitioner services, 14 per cent on community health and welfare services and 4 per cent on welfare foods and other services. This pattern willbroadly continue over the next five years. Expenditure at constant prices onthe service as a whole is planned to increase by about 3.0 per cent in 1970-71over 1969-70 and 4.3 per cent in 1971-72 over 1970-71.Hospital capital expenditure2. Progress in replacing and modernising hospital buildings will continue on the lines set out in the Hospital Building Programme (England and Wales)(Cmnd. 3000) and the Review of the Hospital Plan for Scotland (Cmnd.2877). The programme is intended not only to match the movement and increase in population but also to tackle progressively the problem of obsolescent-lescence; the total number of beds available will not significantly increase.Expenditure covers a wide range of schemes from small projects affectingparts of hospitals, completed in a few weeks, to new hospitals, taking several years to plan, build and bring into use. Maximum value for money is soughtthrough control of costs and the setting of standards. Work on the intro-duction of industrialised building techniques and the use of standard designsis being developed.Hospital running costs3. It is expected that the numbers of in-patients treated will continueto increase at a rate of about 3 per cent per annum during the period, butTABLE 2 16 at 1969 Survey prices
that this can be met without increase in the number of beds by improvements in efficiency. The cost of the hospital services will continue to rise with the increasing use of drugs and supporting services such as pathology and X-rays,the use of new forms of treatment, the provision of improved facilities, andthe need to devote more resources to hitherto deprived classes of patients,particularly the menetally handicapped. The cost of staff represents about70 per cent of the total expenditure on running hospitals, and increasedautomation and improved training and deployment will enable them to beused to the best advantage. The numbers of highly trained and senior staff to run the service are largely determined by decisions taken years before,and the training arrangements will be directed to ensuring that the numbers and qualify of staff required in the late 1970s and the 1980s are available.These aims can be achieved only through continuing attention to savings which can be made by increasing productivity, economy in the use of re-sources and by improved efficiency in organisation, management, and the deployment of services.Family practitioner services4. This heading covers general practitioner, pharmaceutical, dental and ophthalmic services provided under the National Health Service. expenditure is largely determined by the demand for treatment and the developing capacity to meet it. Increased provision reflects small increases in the number of doctors and dentists, improvements in their practice arrangements whichenable more and better treatment to be given, and the tendency for prescription-tion numbers to increase and for more effective, and usually dearer, drugsto be developed.!7)Community hea30i aasce wdfarc services. It is expected that the main growth points in these local authority services will be the building of health centres, which an increasing numberof general practitioners are using, and the development of those services which particularly meet the needs of the mentally disordered, the elderlyand the handicapped. About half the capital expenditure under this headingwill continue to go to providing homes for the elderly.(7) The dental and ophthalmic services would have cost more but for increased charges for dentures and lenses introduced in August 1969.

The schemes of social security cash benefits make up the largest ofthe public expenditure programmes. National insurance benefits (principallyretirement pensions) account for over two-thirds of total expenditure on these schemes. The non-contributory schemes, financed wholly from general laxa-tion and consisting of war pensions, supplementary benefits and family allow-ances, make up the balance apart from administration.2. Table 2.17 above shows, on the basis of existing benefit levels, theestimated distribution of expenditure between the various benefits tip to 1971-72, compared with bow it was distributed in 1968-69.Demographic factors3. At present there are 7.1 million retirement pensioners; by the end of1972, because of increasing numbers of old people, with a larger proportionentitled to pension, and because of a continuing trend towards earlier retire -ment, as well as lighter mortality, there are expected lo be 7.6 million. Alpresent there are 6.9 million children for whom family allowances are pay-able; by 1972 it is expected that there will be 7.4 million. In the held of short-term benefits, allowance has had to be made for an underlying upwardIrend in sickness benefit claims. For all these reasons there would, as Table2.17 illustrates, be a substantial increase in the future cost of social security benefits even apart from changes in the levels of benefit.Increases and improvements4. The Governmenfs policy is to maintain Ihc value of contributory benefits and to do everything possible to ensure that pensioners and otherbeneficiaries should continue to share in the nation&apos;s rising living standards, (ft is not however practicable to forecast the exact date land amountof future benefit increases, which have to be settled in the light of the circttm-stances at the time. The forecasts of social security expenditure in Table 2.17.while taking full account of all the known demographic factors and of (he
new earnings-related scheme(8), are therefore purely illustrative so far as levels of benefit are concerned. They indicate how costs would rise even at existinglevels of (benefit, and do not of course imply that benefits will slay at the same level during the period under review.5. Unlike the other major public expenditure programme a decision to change the levels of social security benefit (as distinct from the fundamentalstructure of the scheme) need only be taken a few months before the newrate is payable. The rates can therefore be adjusted to take account of thegrowth in national income and the developing needs of the community. Butincreased expenditure on social security [benefits has to be met by higherinsurance contributions land taxation raised from the nation as a whole. Theextent to which it will be possible to make further real improvements in thelevel of benefits, over and above expenditure required to take account of price movements^), therefore depends on the rate of growth of the national wealth; and such improvements represent an important potential call on the contingency Reserve.National Superannuation6. The target for the introduction of the new earnings related scheme isApril 1972.FINANCIAL ADMINISTRATION  million table 2-18 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			Tax and rate collection	167-5	168-6	1711	173-3Royal Mint (including dccimalisa-				tion, etc.)	8-8	15-9	10-4	1-other financial administration, etc.	23-8	22-1	21-6	21-post-war credits	18-8	Ts o	17-0	76-0Total	218-9	224-6	220-1	211-9The estimates lor tax and rale collection assume a continuation of existing policies and make no provision for additional fiscal measures.

Thelargest part of the MlPBW expenditure relates lo office buildings, with smallerprovisions for Government training centres, scientific and research buildings and building research and development work, museums and galleries and mis-cellaneous buildings such as the Royal Mint and the Stationery Office.2. Three quarters of the total relates to current expenditure, includingrents, rales, maintenance, running cosls of Government buildings and alsostall&apos; costs. As regards the rest, of the  39.1 million forecast for 1971-72 new buildings account for  34.7 million. The increase in total expenditure is largely attributable to an increase in expenditure on new building work,mainly for computer centres and other office buildings. A considerable num-ber of computer centre projects is in hand. A programme to build nineregional computer centres lor the Inland Revenue was announced recently.Besides providing a more efficient service this programme is expected lo stiveeventually about 6,000 stall&apos;. Expenditure on other offices provides lor schemes to carry out the Governments policy of dispersing staff from London, to house additional staff and to replace accommodation which is sub-standardor uneconomic.TABLE 2-19 al 1969 Survey prices

The public expenditure estimates for Northern Ireland which are shown in Table 2.21 above have been prepared by the Northern Ireland De-partments. The Northern Ireland Government is responsible for the admini-stration of these services and the expenditure is not subject to detailed controlfrom Westminster. The bulk of the expenditure is met from Northern Ireland\sassigned share of United Kingdom taxation, but this revenue is supplementedin particular cases under agreed arrangements. The level of expenditure onthese services is in general determined on the basis of parity of services between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. However, expenditure on assist-ance to industry and employment is related to the level of unemploymentin Northern Ireland, which has been persistently much higher than in thedevelopment areas of Great Britain.
2. The figures in table 2.21 represent public expenditure for which theNorthern Ireland Government is responsible, and do not therefore include expenditure on such items as defence and most agricultural support, which is contained in the relevant United Kingdom programmes. The figures includethe increase in public expenditure in Northern Ireland announced in the Com-munique issued following discussions between the Home Secretary and theNorthern Ireland Government (Cmnd. 4178).CAPITAL EXPENDITURE BY NATIONALISED INDUSTRIES, ETC.  million table 2.22 al 1969 Survey prices	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	provisional	estimates	estimates	estimates	outturn			Expenditure on Jixecl assets				Post Office........	367-8	403-1	468-6	497-7National Coal Board	58-0	63 0	610	600Electricity Council and Boards	5000	436-5	3700	335 0North of Scotland Hydro-Electric				Board      ........	7-9	8-7	14-5	131South of Scotland Electricity Board	61-9	61-7	640	- 55-4Gas Council and Boards	228-5	233-1	233-0	201-british Steel Corporation	690	105 0	135 0	1800British   Overseas   Airways   Cor-				poralion	40-4	511	84-5	70-7British European Airways	52-8	230	43-0	47-british Airports Authority. .	121	11-8	12-7	13-british Railways Board	840	75 0	770	80-5London Transport Board	30-7	16 1	 	 British Transport Docks Board   . .	15-8	18-7	13-7	1.1:british Waterways Board	0-9	1-1	II	1-transport Holding Company	20-6	0-5	0-9	1-2National Freight Corporation	1-8	32-5	28-6	23-7National Bus Company	2-3	13-5	15-8	15-2Scottish Transport Group	1-5	41	3-7	3-6Total expenditure on fixed assets				by nationalised industries   ..	1,556 0	1,558-5	1,627 1	1,611-7Shortfall     ........		-1000	-125-0	-1500BBC,     1TA,    Covenl    Garden				Market Authority	14-8	20-6	19-9	21-6Total expenditure on fixed assets	1,570-8	1,479-1	1,522 0	1,483-3Sales of fixed assets	-43-8	-36-0	-31-7	-27-1Statistical adjustments(i)	-11-5	-12-9	-12-5	- 21-2Total   gross  domestic   fixed				capital formation	1,515-5	1,430-2	1,477-8	1,435-other capital expenditure	-5-5	8-4	3-9	1-4Total	1,5100	1,438-6	1,473-9	1,436-4(i) Deduction of certain central government capital grants to nationalised industries, andof Post Office repayment services (included in local authorities capital expenditure), to avoiddouble-counting.1. The capital expenditure of the nationalised industries has been risingin the past decade and is expected to continue at much the present level.An upward trend is expected from 1969-70&apos;to 1971-72 again thereafter. This
overall pattern is the net result of a number of changes in the main programmes.Telecommunications2. Demand for telecommunications both inland and overseas, requires ahigh and rising level of investment throughout the period. The main objectivewill continue to be the improvement of the quality of service. In addition tothe growth of traffic and the connection of new customers, the capital pro-gramme caters for further modernisation, the expansion of the data transmis-sion service and measures to aid productivity. The estimates include provisionfor converting the few remaining manual telephone exchanges to automaticworking and extending subscriber trunk dialling (STD) to all customers.Fuel3. Investment by the fuel industries is expected to decline until 1972-73.Within this pattern the National Coal Board&apos;s investment is likely to remain at about present levels (subject to the development of its participation in oil and gas exploration).4. Electricity investment consists of a fairly steady rate of expenditure onthe distribution system and a variable element of expenditure on generationand transmission. The latter is likely to go on falling until about 1972, whiledemand for electricity in England and Wales moves into balance with the plantexpected to be available. The forecasts allow for ordering two new power stations in 1970 Heysham in England and one in the West of Scotland. TheGovernment have recently approved the inclusion of stations at Drax andSizewell, and the Isle of Grain, in the Central Electricity Generating Board&apos;slonger term programme. The case for starting a second station in England in1970 will be reviewed early next year. The timing of later orders will be con-sidered subsequently in the light of the demand forecasts and other relevant factors.5. The gas industry&apos;s expenditure is directed to the rapid introduction of natural gas through the establishment of a pipeline system for transmission ofthe gas and the conversion of consumers&apos; equipment to use it: expenditure isexpected to reach a peak in 1970-71 and to fall away gradually thereafter.Steel6. The British Steel Corporation^ investment plans for the long term arestill tentative and the estimates shown in Table 22 are preliminary figures.Some increase from the present level of expenditure seems likely in the nextfew years.Transport7. The re-equipment of the two state airlines is forecast to result in BEA&apos;expenditure peaking in the middle of the period, and boac&apos;s running at ahigh level from 1970-71 onwards and rising to a peak at the end of the period.8. The investment of the other parts of the nationalised transport sectorwill probably continue at a steady level throughout the period. The proposednationalisation of much of the ports industry will in due course have the effect
of including the investment of the major ports in the figures for the nationalised industries sector, but this will not of course add to the total real demand on resources.9. Of the other major transport undertakings, the National Freight Cor-poration will direct much of its investment to replacing vehicles but some alsoto making profitable use of opportunities as they arise. The National bus company is also concerned mainly with vehicle programmes, with their busesneeding replacement at a fairly even rate. Much of the annual investment of theScottish Transport Group also is devoted to replacing buses, but in additionthey have a steady programme of expenditure on new ships to modernise thefleets serving the Clyde and the Western Islands of Scotland.10. The future course of British Rail&apos;s investment will depend on thedevelopment of the Board&apos;s corporate planning; in the meantime it is assumed that railway investment will continue at about the same rate as for the last fewyears.Shortfall11. For the nationalised industries as a whole, experience shows that capital expenditure in the aggregate tends to fall short of the approved figure.For the purpose of forecasting total investment by nationalised industries,therefore, reductions (shown as &quot; short fall&quot;) of  100 million in 1969-70,  125million in 1970-71 and  150 million in 1971-72 have been made from theaggregate expenditure on fixed assets by the individual industries given inTable 2.22.SCOTLAND:Expenditure within the Secretary of State&apos;s responsibility  million table 2.23 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 provisional outturn	1969-70 estimate	1970-71 estimate	1971-72 estimateCivil defence	10	0-6	0-6	0-6Roads and public lighting	65-3	66-3	71-1	77-transport	1-6	41	5-3	7-other assistance to employment				and industry	2-8	3-6	4-1	4-5Research Councils, etc.	2-5	2-7	30	3-3Agriculture, fisheries and forestry..	51-4	59-7	60-9	61-4Housing	226-1	2260	230-1	238-local environmental services	84-5	86-2	88-6	89-law and order	48-4	49 0	52-7	55-2Education	213-9	219-8	229-4	239-8Health and welfare	191-9	194-5	200-6	208-5Miscellaneous services	4-8	4-5	4-8	4-9Total	893-9	917-4	951-2	990-5By Spending Authority Central government = 367-local authorities = 538-public corporations   = 45-1951-2
1. Table 2.23 provides separate expenditure figures relating to services inScotland for which the Secretary of Sta(e&apos;s Departments are directly or indirectly responsible. Besides expenditure on national services such as de-fence, overseas aid; technological assistance and social security for which allo-cations are possible only on an arbitrary basis, they exclude investment by great Britain Departments and the nationalised industries in Scotland.2. The Scottish figures show differences in the pattern of expenditure by comparison with Great Britain as a whole, corresponding to differences in circumstances and needs. One of the main differences is in housing. Because ofScotland&apos;s reliance on rented housing and because the housing programme isbeing maintained at a high level to meet the needs of slum clearance, urbanrenewal and industrial relocation, Scotland has a proportionately huge share ofpublic sector housing investment.3. The responsibilities of the Secretary of State&apos;s Departments in relationto civil defence, roads and public lighting, housing and local environmental services are virtually the same as those of the corresponding English M i nisi -ries. Differences in the coverage of other expenditure blocks are (&quot;briefly) asfollows:  Transport: The Scottish figures cover only rural bus and ferry grants,infrastructure expenditure, support to the Scottish Transport Group,certain shipping companies, and departmental administration. They donot include fuel grants, new bus grants, support to British Rail, theNational Freight Corporation, the British Waterways Board, the port authorities and civil aviation.Other assistance to employment and industry: The iligures relate only to assistance Ho &quot;the coal industry (by way of grants to (he two ScottishElectricity Boards for using extra coal) and (to expenditure by the highlands and Islands Development Board and the Scottish TouristBoard. They exclude Redundancy Fund -payments, SET additional payments, payments of regional employment premiums, investment grants and certain other grants.Research Councils: The figures cover only agricultural &quot;research in Scot-land financed from Scottish Votes; they do not include Scollancfsshare of expenditure from -the Science, Social Science, Medical, Agri-cultural, and Natural Environmental Research Councils.Agriculture, fisheries and forestry: This includes the Scottish share of the costs of agricultural -support and other agricultural and fishing servicesmet -separately by the Department of Agriculture -and Fisheries forScotland. Other expenditure on agricultural support and on animal health services which is met by the Ministry of Agriculture fisheries and -Food is excluded, as well as expenditure by the Forestry Corn-mission.Education and &quot;local libraries: The figures include all expenditure by the&quot;Scottish Education Department and local authorities, including expen-diturc on schools, further education, teacher training, youth serviceetc. Expenditure by the University Grants Committee in Scotland is excluded.
4. Responsibility in respect of social work services, exercised in Englandpartly by the Home Office under the law and order head and partly by theDepartment of [Health and Social Security under the health and welfare head,is now grouped together in Scotland in view of the setting up of local authoritysocial work departments with effect from 17 November 1969 and ilhe cominginto operation (sometime towards the end of 1970-71) of the new system ofchildrens hearings to replace the juvenile courts under Part HI of the social work (Scotland) Act 1968. Total expenditure on social work services isexpected to rise from just over  174 million in 1969-70 to about  20 million in 1971-72. In all tables in this White Paper, however, this expenditure fallspartly under law and order and partly under health and welfare.5. Scotlands share of the nationalised industries&apos; total investment is covered by the Great Britain figures in Table 2.22.WALES :Expenditure within (he Secretary of state&apos;s rcsponsihilily  million table 2.24 at 1969 Survey prices	1968-69 Provisional outturn	1969-70 Estimate	1970-71 Estimate	1971-72 EstimateRoads and public lighting Housing Local environmental services Health and welfare Other..........

The expenditure figures for Wales in Table 2.24 relate solely lo ser-vices for which the Secretary of State is responsible. They include not onlyexpenditure which is the direct responsibility of his Department but alsoexpenditure by local authorities, hospitals and other agencies operating in wales, for which the Secretary of Slate has indirect responsibility.2. Table 2.24 shows that this expenditure was  208 million in 1968-69.This is expected to increase to  237 million in 1971-72. iNcarly 50 per cent of the total is expenditure by the Welsh Office, the remainder being expendi-lure incurred by local authorities and the other public bodies concerned.Where there are differences in the pattern of expenditure in Wales comparedwith that for Great Britain as a whole, they correspond with differences in circumstances and needs.3. The table does not show the full extent of public expenditure in Wales.Other Government expenditure (for example, on education and social security)and expenditure by the nationalised industries are also of great importance to wales and are of concern to the .Secretary of Stale in view of his responsibilities for the oversight of Goverment activities in general throughout the Principality.Arrangements have therefore been made, to enable the Secretary of State not
only to look at his own programmes in relation to the corresponding english and Scottish programmes hut also to take a view of the Welsh parts of other ministers&apos; programmes.4. The (Secretary of State&apos;s responsibilities in relation to roads and publiclighting, housing, local environmental services and health and welfare arevirtually the same as those of the corresponding English Ministers.5. The figures for &quot;other expenditure &quot; relate to a variety of items suchas rural bus and ferry grants and infrastructure expenditure on transport, theexpenditure by the Wales Tourist Board, and grants to the &quot;National Libraryof Wales and the National Museum of Wales. They do not include expendi-ture for which the Ministry of Transport and the Board of Trade are respon-sible in support of British Rail, the National Freight Corporation, the BritishWaterways Board, the port authorities and civil aviation. Nor do they includeRedundancy Fund payments, SET additional payments, payments of regional employment premiums, investment grants or certain other grants.

LOCAL AUTHORITIES FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THEGOVERNMENT1. There are 1210 operating units of local government in England, 234 inScotland and 181 in Wales, and together with the local authorities in NorthernIreland they are responsible for some 30 per cent of total public expenditureexcluding debt interest. The great toulk of this expenditure is incurred by a reta-tively few large authorities; for example over two-thirds of total local authority expenditure in England is the responsibility of less than one-seventh of the totalnumber of authorities.2. Local authorities are in the first instance responsible for most of theexpenditure on roads (other than trunk roads), housing, local environmental ser-vices, law and order and (largest of all) education.3. Many aspects of local government will be affected by the reorganisationwhich is to take place in England and in Scotland following the reports of thetwo Royal Commissions on local Government, and also in Wales.4. The present financial arrangements between the central government andlocal authorities differ between capital expenditure and current expenditure, withcloser control over capital. All such expenditure initiated by local authorities onprojects financed toy borrowing requires loan sanction. In some major programmes housing and schools a specific approval is also needed for the start of projects.Capital grants for principal roads are approved for individual schemes. most other projects do not receive capital grants, but the Government meets a substantial part of the cost through continuing annual grants towards the interest charges on the borrowing from which the projects are financed. There are special Govern-ment subsidies towards the interest charges incurred on housing; these subsidies,together with other Government subsidies and the subsidies paid from the rates to balance the local authorities&apos; housing revenue accounts, are shown in the&quot;Subsidies&quot; figures in Table 2.11, with the capital costs of new houses shown under the beading &quot; Investment and improvements&quot;. Interest charges resultingfrom other capital programmes count as part of the revenue expenditure whichreceives rate support grant under the arrangements explained in paragraph below; these interest charges are not, however, apportioned to the tables for thevarious functional programmes.5. It is far from easy to translate programmes of these capital projects intoforecasts of annual expenditure. Generally speaking the estimates of the phasing of the expenditure year by year are worked out by Departments from theircentral experience rather than provided by the local authorities themselves. It ishoped that the development of the relationships between Departments and localauthorities following reorganisation will facilitate improved arrangements forforward programmes.6. Estimates of the total revenue expenditure of local authorities as a whole are discussed with the local authority associations for the purpose of determiningrate support grant. These determinations take place every other year for thecoming two-year period. The last was made in 1968 in respect of 1969-70 and1970-71; the next is due to be made next year, in respect of 1971-72 and 1972-73.The total figures used in such determinations are accompanied by forecasts ofthe revenue expenditure expected to toe incurred on each of the functional pro-grammes, and individual local authorities are thereafter expected to be guided by this indication of relative priorities. However, the actual amount of revenue expenditure incurred by an individual local authority, whether financed from itsrate revenue or from rate support grant, and the detailed allocation of this totalbetween individual services are in the hands of that authority.
APPENDIX IICOMPARISON WITH PAST PUBLISHED ESTIMATES OF FORWARDPROGRAMMES1. The following table compares the estimates in this White Paper of expendi-ture in 1969-70 and 1970-71 with those given for the corresponding categories ofexpenditure in the White Paper of February 1969 &quot; Public Expenditure, 1968-69to 1970-71 &quot; (Cmnd. 3936) revalued at 1969 Survey prices.2. Of the larger changes in 1969-70 the estimate for &quot;Other Assistance to employment and Industry &quot; incorporates a revised estimate of the proportion of manufacturing investment eligible for investment grant. The increase in theestimate for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is largely attributable to the 1969Farm Price Review. As against these increases in 1969-70, there are lower esti-mates for &quot;Other Military Defence&quot; (a re-phasing of progress payments onU.S.-built military aircraft, together with an overall reduction in the cost of theprogramme) and Local Environmental Services (now information on expenditure by local authorities). The small net increase in the provision for identifiedexpenditure programmes has been met from the Contingency Reserve whichoriginally stood at  75 million.3. As regards 1970-71, there are, for the reasons explained in the preceding paragraph, increases for &quot;Other Military Defence &quot;, &quot; Other Assistance ito Employ-ment and Industry &quot; and &quot; Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry &quot;. But these areoffset by reductions, including a reduction of  76 million in the Defence Budget,which the Government have made in the plans for other programmes.

APPENDIX illNOTES ON METHODOLOGYI. These notes explain the conventions and classifications used in this white paper. A fuller account of the principles underlying this presentation and ofcertain technical aspects of it is given in the Governments Green Paper of April.1969 (&apos;), particularly in Appendix 11.Definitions and Coverage2. In order that the figures can be consistent as far as possible with the statistics and forecasts of national income and expenditure, they follow themethods, sources and definitions which the Central Statistical Office use for public sector transactions in the national income accounts (7). The public sectorcomprises central government (including the National Insurance Funds), localauthorities and public corporations (including the nationalised industries). Apartfrom transactions on operating account by the nationalised industries and othertrading bodies, all current and capital transactions are covered. Transfers betweenthe public sector and other sectors are included but internal transfers, such ascentral government grants and loans to local authorities and public corporations,are generally eliminated. Indirect taxes, including selective employment tax, paidby public bodies, are included as part of the cost of the programmes to whichthey relate, and are credited as receipts by the authority to which they accrue.Subsidies to public authorities&apos; trading services and to public corporations arealso included, since they are paid to their operating accounts.3. The figures in this White Paper exclude imputed rents which are usedin the national income statistics to measure the value of the use made of publicly-owned fixed capital assets in the provision of public services; this is because ofthe difficulties of estimation and deficiencies of coverage. Since imputed rentswould be entered both as a receipt and a payment, their inclusion would make no difference to the figures for the balances in the tables which show bothreceipts and expenditure by the public sector.4. At the back of the Blue Book, &quot; National Income and Expenditure &quot;, a table showing the Treasury analysis of public expenditure provides figures forpast financial years on a basis which is consistent with the calendar year figures shown elsewhere in the Blue Book. Expenditure in this table is analysed byprogrammes according to the classification used by the Government for taking decisions on public expenditure. The same classification is used in the tablesanalysing expenditure by programmes in this White Paper.Price Basis5. The Blue Book shows expenditure for the past at outturn (or current)prices; that is, the actual prices at which expenditure was incurred during theyear in question. But for the purpose of Government decisions the forward&apos; estimates are made on a constant price basis. This enables comparisons to bemade of changes in demands on resources arising directly or indirectly, from public expenditure in successive years, and the growth of total public expenditure to be related to what is acceptable in the light of the likely growth of the economy as a whole.6. The estimates of current expenditure on goods and services are on asimilar price basis to that used in the 1969-70 Supply Estimates, apart fromthe increase in rates of selective employment tax introduced in the April, 1969,Budget. Those for gross domestic fixed capital formation are mostly at March1969 prices. In some cases, however, such as roads and education, they relateto the price basis currently in use for planning purposes which may differ from march 1969.(&apos;) &quot; Public Expenditure: A New Presentation,&quot; Cmnd. 4017.(2) Described in &quot;National Accounts Statistics: Sources and Methods,&quot; HMSO, 1968.
7. The expression of transfer payments payments which do not involve adirect purchase of goods and services at constant prices can only be on an arbi-trary (basis: for example, relating them to general purchasing power. Some grants and subsidies, such as grants to universities and the aid programme, are expressedin money terms, that is, at the amount expected to be disbursed in each year,irrespective of price changes which may by then have occurred. Although thistreatment progressively overstates the demands on resources which such moneyexpenditure would transfer, there is nothing in the change in the amount of moneybeing provided from year to year that can be specifically attributed to the effectof price changes. An overall adjustment related to the estimated movement in theprice level of the output of the economy as a whole is therefore included in theline &quot; Relative price effect and other adjustments &quot; in the relevant tables. social security benefits are treated differently, in th manner explained below. Where sub-subsidies are intended to reimburse deficits, in the manner explained below. Wheresubsidies are intended to reimburse deficits, the estimates may be entirely notional.Agricultural subsidies are the most important example. The estimates of debt interest are projections at outturn price deflated to constant prices by the pricedeflator applicable to the gross domestic product.8. For reasons explained in paragraph 30 of the Green Paper estimates of public sector receipts are in some tables set alongside the estimates of expen-diture. Taxes and other receipts (other than social security contributions), includ-ing charges for goods and services, have in the first instance been estimated atoutturn prices. They have then been deflated to estimated 1969-70 outturn prices in the manner described for those items of expenditure originally estimated atoutturn prices.9. In all the tables showing expenditure by programmes social security benefits are expressed in terms of existing levels of benefit since, as explained in Section 2.17, it is not practicable to forecast the exact date and amount of future benefit increases. But in order that the total of public expenditure willprovide a measure of the estimated demand on resources the line &quot; relative price effect and other adjustments&quot; contains a net entry for social securitycomprising two elements (a) a downward adjustment relating to the forecastmovement in prices and (b) a notional upward adjustment for biennial upratingson account of such price movements. On the receipts side social security conlribu-tions have been calculated in a similar manner. The entries against this item reflect the continuation of existing rates of contributions, and a net adjustment to allow for movements in prices and a notional biennial uprating is made in the line&quot; Other receipts&quot; in Text Table 1.2 and in the line &quot;Taxes and other unallocatedreceipts &quot; in Tables 1.7 to 1.10.10. In order that estimated receipts may be compared with estimated expen-diture on a consistent price basis a further overall adjustment, included within&quot; Relative price effect and other adjustments &quot;, converts the expenditure figures at 1969 Survey prices to estimated 1969-70 outturn prices.Relative Price Effect11. The definition of constant prices applied lo the measurement of public expenditure described above follows that used in the national income statistics.This means that no account is taken of possible increases in rates of pay beyondthe sum already agreed for the financial year 1969-70 and reflected in the1969-70 Supply Estimates. The output of those employed in the public sector istaken, as equal to their pay; productivity and pay are taken as constant.12. As a result of the use of this convention, the estimates of public expendi-ture as a proportion of gross domestic product at constant prices will progressivelyunderstate what the proportion would be at current prices. This is becauseincreases in productivity in the private sector will be reflected in increased outputat constant prices, while increases in productivity in the public sector will be ignored except in cases where a given task is performed by fewer stall: Further-(3) As measured by gross domestic product at factor cost.
more, rising productivity in the private sector will be accompanied by rising real earnings which tend to be matched by public sector real earnings.13. One way of making allowance for this situation is to add to the constant price series a growing amount equal to the expected future difference (derivedfrom past trends) between the share in total output of public expenditure on cur-rent goods and services at current prices and its share at constant prices. Approxi-mate calculations suggest that this difference is of the order of It to 2 per cent ayear of public expenditure at factor cost on current goods and services. The rcla-tive size of the difference has, however, varied from year to year and may beexpected to continue to do so. This is the basis of the adjustment for the &quot; relative price effect&quot; insofar as it applies to public consumption (current expenditure on goods and services). It has not yet proved possible to allocate it by&apos; programmes,though clearly the programmes which involve employing relatively large numbersof people, eg health and education, will account for most of it. A similar adjust-merit has been applied to those transfer payments which have been classified asresources^). The relative prices of other expenditures may also move dilferenti-ally and adjustments should in theory be made for these. But in practice the size of the corrections is not likely to be significant and some of them may be in adownward direction; no allowance has, therefore, been made for them.14. The end product of all these adjustments is a set of projections whichdiscount the clfcct of general price changes, as do all constant price estimates, butalso attempt to allow lor changes in relative prices which projections of quantitiesand of employment alone cannot do.Presentation of adjustments15. The estimates for individual programmes have been entered in the de-tailed tables of Part 2 without any of the adjustments described in the preceding paragraphs. They have been carried through on the same price basis into the summary tables in Parts I and 3. With the exception of overseas aid and social security these estimates are referred to as &quot;at 1969 Survey prices&quot;. The line&quot; Relative price effect and other adjustments&quot; in the summary table includes allthe adjustments necessary to convert the expenditure estimates to 1969-70 outturn prices, the basis on which the totals of public expenditure are expressed. the adjustment line also includes an allowance for shortfall in the years 1969-70 and1970-71 and for statistical adjustments (timing and roundings). The allowance forshortfall is included to correct a tendency towards over-estimation of the figures in the early years of the period ahead. The total adjustment shown in the tables for the years 1968-69 to 1971-72 is made tip as follows:   million	1968-69	1969-70	1970-71	1971-72	Provisional	estimate	estimate	estimate	outturn			1.

16. The table in Appendix II compares/programme by programme on a coni-paruble price basis the estimates of public expenditure in 1969-70 and 1970-71 usgiven in the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement of 20 February I969(-V) withthe latest estimates of expenditure. The basis of this comparison is 1969 survey prices and the capital expenditure of the nationalised industries, debt interestand the relative price effect arc excluded. Adjustments I, 4 and 5 in the table inthe preceding paragraph have to be token into account in making this comparisonand are accordingly included in the line &quot; Price adjustments, etc.&quot; in the table inAppendix 11. The comparison is not affected by adjustments 2 and 3 and the make up of the entry in the line &quot; Relative price effect and adjustment to 1969-70 out-turn prices &quot;.17. The reconciliation of the latest estimates of the totals to which the pub-lished limits apply with totals of public expenditure shown in the tables else wherein this White Paper is as follows:   million	1968 69	1969-70	1970-71	provisional provisional	estimate	estimate/(/ 1969 Survey Prices Total subject lo limits Nationalised industries, etc. capital expenditure Debt interest Adjustment to 1969-70 outturn prices Relative price effect	15,822 1,510 2,05 1 352 140	16,214 1,439 2,050 354	16,712 1,474 2,050 362 146Al 1969-70 outturn prices Total public expenditure	19,595	20,057	20,744Classification by Resource Use18. As explained in paragraph 34 of the Green Paper, in order to give ;ibroad indication of the use of resources implied by different types of public expenditure, the relevant transactions arc set out tin three groups-.....-resources.transfers, taxation, etc., and assets. The principles underlying the allocation of items to these three groups are described in paragraphs 3 to 5 of Appendix Itto Ihe Green Paper. The actual allocation used for the purpose of this white paper, given below, is consonant with the present -availability of data on public sector receipts and expenditure. in the course of time further improvements andrefinements should be possible.Attribution of expenditure ami receipts to programme19. All expenditure, irrespective of the authority by which it is incurred,has been, allocated in the tables to one or other of twenty functional programmes.The public expenditure of Northern Ireland and the capital expenditure by the nationalised industries (including the broadcasting authorities and the Coven IGarden Market Authority) arc brought together under single headings; and so isdebt interest. In Tables 1.7 lo 1.10 all receipts from, sales and charges and from contributions (national insurance, national health and Redundancy Fund) havebeen allocated, to programmes and as far as possible earnings (trading surpluses,rent, dividends and. interest) have also been attributed lo programmes in accord-ance with the allocation of the associated expenditure on assets. A relatively small amount of rent, dividends and interest, which it is not possible to &quot;allocate, is included with receipts from taxation and certain other miscellaneous items ofrevenue in the line &quot;Taxes and other unallocated receipts&quot;.20. In the case of nationalised industries and other public enterprises, grosstrading surpluses have to provide for interest charges on capital and (where appropriate) tax payments. This reduces the amount available to the public cnter-(!) &quot; Public Expenditure, 1968-69 to 1970-71&quot;, Cmnd. 3936.
prises for gross capital formation. In order that their residual financing require -ment should not be understated and that the expenditure totals should correspond with previous presentations, the appropriate interest and tax payments have beendeducted from the trading surpluses and entered among unallocated receipts.21. Expenditure on overseas aid is included within line 1 of category (A)in Table 1.2 net of loan service payments: it represents the net resource costof this expenditure within the continuing aid programme. In the figures of total public expenditure (line 14 of Table 1.2), and in the other tables of the white paper where this total appears, overseas aid expenditure is included gross of loanservice payments; this is the basis on which the programme is planned and con-trolled, as representing the best measure of new expenditure in the form of trans-fers and lending overseas. The remainder of public expenditure on overseas aid i.e., the balance between the figures in line 1 and those in line 14 of Table 1.2 is included in line 4 of category (B) of that table; and line 8 of that table includes the corresponding amount received in repayments of capital and payments ofinterest on earlier aid loans. This treatment of expenditure on overseas aid is alsofollowed in Tables 1.7 to 1.10.
