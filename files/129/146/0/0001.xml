(TillS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^S GOVE^IMENTlCOPY NO._,6oCABINETPUBLIC EXPEIDITUl-OS WHITE paper memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerAttached is the draft of the White Paper on public expenditureup to 1973-74- which, following recent Government statements,Parliament will be expecting to receive about the turn of themonth.    (The proposed date of publication is now 2nd December,)There are some points on the draft to which I draw my colleagues1particular attentionePublic expenditure in the past2.     Future annual White Papers will probably not need to look backto any extent, but in this first one some outline of the past course and pattern of public expenditure is needed.    It provides much ofthe justification of what we have done and plan to do.   But how farshould we go back?   The draft shows one alternative - to go backabout a decade, which is as far as the directly comparable figuresgo.   But this alternative might possibly provoke the Oppositionto argue that their record showed a greater success in relating thegrowth of public expenditure to the growth of G.N.P.   Their recordshows average annual increases in public expenditure of 4,. 2 per cent and in G.N.P, of 3.6 per cent against ours over the past four yearsof 5.9 per cent and 2.1 per cent respectively.3.     Annex I to this paper includes in paragraphs 2 and 3 analternative possibility, going back only to 1964-65.   the disadvantage with this course is that we should not be able to illustrate the change in priorities since 1964? such as the increasein the rate of growth of expenditure on social services and the fallin-expenditure on defence and external relations.4,     I should welcome my colleagues&apos; views;    I incline to the first alternative.The size of the public sector5.     Whichever course we take, something has to be said about thesise of the public sector in 1968-69 (paragraph 5 of the draft).As a crude measure of size, the total can be described as equivalentto just over half the gross national product.   This could be a damaging figure, and doubtless it will be used against us whetheror not it appears in the White Paper.   I think myself it would be best to mention it - but in the next sentences explain how littleit really means (as in the draft if the sentences in square bracketsare retained)../1972-73
jj? 72-75 and 1973-74b,     Paragraphs 32 to 33 of the. draft deal, with the years beyond those for which we have taken firu\ decisions.   Officials have discussed extensively what should be included about these years *There is u coaimitment to Parliauent to give a full set of programme totals for 1972-73 and 1973-74.   The problem has beenthat the levels of expenditure which we have decided up to1971 -72 are considerably lower than in the original 1969 Survey,and if we were to publish the Survey figures for the final twoyears as they stand, even after using every advantage that thereis in our new conventions for presenting the figures they would show a sharp discontinuity? they would rise faster than in thepreceding years, and faster than we can reasonably assume that thenation&apos;s resources would be rising.   The average annual lneree.seunder our plans for t9bS-69 to \ 971 -72 will, be 3 per cent;; it wouldthen, on the basis of the unattended Survey figures, have risen toabout 4-, per cent in 1 972-73 and 4 per cent in 1 973-7^-.7,     The principle of the solution which officials have worked out vand which is embodied in the draft, is that we should publish abroad provisional allocation between the programmes of a totalrising at 3h per cent per annum, representing a reasonable view ofthe average rate of growth of national resources at the time.   Thefigures put forward by officials are in table \ .6 of paragraph 32of the draft.   The main points to be noted on that cable are asfollows,8.     The Con11 ngency Reserve is barely large enough to carryconviction,, we may need substantial sums for upratings of social security benefits in i97l and i973 and other new charges are inevitable.   In the table, the Contingency Reserve is in effect the balancing item bringing out the totals of public expenditure at levels which rise by 3^ per cent in each year.   This means thatthe Contingency Reserve would be affected   for  , by any netchanges which we may decide to make in the individual programmetotals shown in the table as it stands.9.    The figures for the Defence Budget are in square brackets, since they are simply those shown in the j9^9 Survey,    (The figure for\973-74 was a Treasury figure, not accepted by the Ministry ofDefence.)   i&apos;.iy view is that, within the aggregate of public sector expenditure to be accommodated, these figures are too high, andthat they should be put at  2,070 million in both years.   TheSecretary of State for Defence, to whom 1 have expressed this view,is prepared to accept a figure of  2,070 million for 1972-73.    Buthe is unwilling to accept this figure for 1973-74, since he considersthat he will need a higher figure for that year than in 1972-73.&apos;lO.
10.   The figures for Overseas Aid in the table are merely thelevel which we have decided for 1971-72, carried forward.   other papers which are before us raise the question of the rate of increase to be shown in this programme in 1972-73 and 1973-74?and whatever we decide will need to be substituted for the figures in the table.   Any increase would reduce pro tanto the contingency reserve.11.   The Social Security figures represent benefits at theircash value today, distributed to the number of beneficiaries atthe time as estimated by the Government Actuary,   An adjustmentincluded in line 24 of the table (on the basis of upratingscompensating only for price increases in the intervals betweenupratings) ensures that this method of presentation does notoverstate the claim which social security benefits would put onreal resources.   This ensures that the presentation does notunderstate the real resources available for allocation to other programmes, though it also entails treating any uprating whichgoes further than compensating for price increases as a potentialcharge on the Contingency Reserve, in the same way as any undecidedclaim for any other programme.    The social security element in theNorthern Ireland programme has been treated in the same way.12,   The estimates of nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure,which in this year&apos;s annual review were revised downwards from the1969 Survey figures by  118 million for 1972 -73 and  142 million for 1973-74, have been reduced by a further  50 million in eachof these years for assumed shortfall.13.   The figures for all the other programmes have been calculatedby writing down the 19&amp;9 Survey figures (as altered by events since june) by t .1 per cent for 1972-73 and 1.8 per cent for 1973-74.It seems to me that, within the limits set by the total and theneed to preserve a convincing Contingency Reserve, this arithmeticcomes close to expressing an acceptable though provisional viewof our broad priorities, subject to further consideration of thefigures Tor the Defence Budget and Overseas Aid.14.   As the draft explains, the published figures for 1972-73 and1973-74 would be approximate and provisional until in due coursethey are given, with or without amendment, the status of firm decisions.   Internally they would represent the starting point for the preparation of next year&apos;s Survey of public expenditure5this would be our best insurance against having to make reductions in programmes next year on the scale of this year!s review.H.J.K.M.

Note   Both these tables, A and B, include uncer &quot;commerce and Industry&quot; for 1968-69 expenditure on investment grants, regional employment premiums, and selective employment tax additional payments, but excludethis expenditure from the percentage increases shown.3,    If Table B were used, the commentary would be as follows;&quot;Between 1964-65 and 1968-69 the Government1s new defencepolicies brought about a fall in defence expenditure in real terms.In the civil sector, regional development policy was combined with measures to modernise and restructure industry, and withexpenditure on other items under this heading, includingscientific and technological research and other measures insupport of industry and employment, this became the fastest risinggroup of programmes - 9.O54 per cent per annum.   Priority was also given to the social services on which expenditure was increasedby an average annual rate overall of 6.0 per cent, including 4*9per cent on education, 3.9 per cent on heailth and welfare and.3 per cent on social security.   Nationalised industries capitalexpenditure rose at an average of 2.3 per cent a year overall.Electricity investment rose slowly at first and then turneddownward, while investment by the coal industry and on tnerailways continued to decrease.The net effect of all these movements was to produce anaverage annual increase in total public expenditure between1964-65 and 1968-69 of 5*9 per cent (including the relative price Effect^) with expenditure on defence beginning to fall butcivil expenditure, particularly on the social and economicservices, rising faster than before.The rates of increase given for particular programmes do not take account of the Relative Price Effect.    This is included inthe rates of increase given for public sector expenditure as awhole and accounts for about % per cent per annum spread over the programmes other than debt interest and nationalised industries&apos;capital expenditure.^     See Appendix III, Methodology, paragraphs 11-15, for a fullexplanation of the Relative Price Effect.&quot;
December, 1969PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: 1968-69 TO 1973*7^FOREWORDIn jspril this year the Government proposed that &quot;there shouldbe published towards the end of each calendar year a White paper which will present to Parliament the results of the Governmentsconsideration of the prospect for public expenditure&quot; (Cmnd.i4.Oi7,paragraph 5)*This proposal was welcomed by the Select Committee on procedure in their Report on the Scrutiny of Public expenditure and Administration (H.C.410).    In the debate on the Report consideration October the Government announced their intention to produce thefirst White Paper in the new series in the near future, and thiswas foreshadowed also in the Queen8s Speech.

CONFIDENTIALPART I;    PUBLIC EXPENDITURE - THE GENERAL PROSPECTINTRODUCTION1.     This White Paper sets out the Governments plans for public expendi-ture for the current financial year 1969-70/for the next two years. it also gives projections of expenditure on a provisional and approximatebasis for the tbe subsequent years, 1972-73 and 1973-7U, for whichthe Government have not yet taken decisions *    These plans andprojections give expression to the Government&apos;s policy that expendi-ture on public services shall expand throughout the period broadlyin line with the growth of the nation^ resources as a whole,2.      Public expenditure is a generic term for a large number of programmes and services administered by individual Departments,local authorities, nationalised industries, and other public corpora-tions and agencies, all financed in varying degrees by theGovernment and subject in varying ways to central influence or control.    At any one time it reflects the results of a complex of decisions, some stretching back several years, the effects of whichwill often be felt for many years to come.   Basic reviews of policy to time are made, in particular-programmes from time / But most of the decisions which the Government takes on public expenditure from year to year are directed to the questions:   what modifications should be madeto existing programmes?   How much provision should be made for new policies or for developments of existing programmes?   What is thesensible allowance to include for further developments ofpolicy, or to meet unexpected turns of events?3,      In making their plans and carrying them out the Governmenthave to take account of changing circumstances at home and abroad.They also have to allow for special features of the programmes them-selves.    ffos, some programmes, expenditure depends in part on government decisions but in part also on what happens beyond the
$each of government.     Examples are   sickness benefit,where the Government decides the rate of benefit but the occurrence of sickness determines whether benefit is paid;   orinvestment grants, where the rate of grant is decided by theGovernment but its payment depends on the amount of investment done by industry.     In other cases a probable call for additional spendingcan be foreseen, but not the precise timing and scale of that expenditure - for example, support for future, as yet unforraulated,technological projects.     Then, for nearly 30 per cent of total public expenditure, local authorities, with their own degree of autonomy, share responsibility with the Government;   broadly, their capital expenditure which is financed by borrowing requires centralsanction, but they have power to decide how much current expenditure to incur, in the light of the guidance which the Government is ableto give on the standards of services and on the relative prioritiesbetween services and of the volume of Government funds availableto them   in support of their own revenue (see Appendix I),4.       For all these reasons any forward plans for public expenditure as a whole need&apos;  to he flexible, and the figures in which plans are expressed at any one time should be interpreted with this in mind.The next sections of this paper briefly trace how expenditure hasmoved in recent years, and then set out the future prospects.2
0)     1969-70 estimated outturn prices.   By outturn (or current)prices is meant the actual prices at which expenditure was incurred,or is estimated to be incurred, during the year in question.(2)    1959-60 is the first year for which comparable figures areavailable.35,    Total puDiic expenditure was running in 1968-69 at some 19,600 million at to-day&apos;s prices.^ ^This was equivalent in siaeto 52 per cent of the gross national product, compared with just underlik per cent in 196^-65 and 41 per cent in 1959-60 /2^//Wi thin the totalof  19.600 million in 1968-69,^7  12,500 million or roughly two-thirdswas spent directly by public bodies themselves on the purchase of resources.   The balance of  7,000 million consisted almost entirely of transfer payments, such as social security benefits and industrialsubsidies;   it is the recipients of these payments, not the public authorities, who decide how the money is spent.6.    The following table shows in broad terms how, within the risingtotal, the composition of public expenditure was being changed:

The percentagechanges in columns (e) and (f) for this group and for thetotal are calculated excluding these new expenditures.(ii)   &quot;Relative Price Effect&quot; is the term used to refer to the allowance that needs to be made for the fact that over a periodof time a series of figures on a constant price basis willunderstate the share of national resources which public expenditure pre-empts.   For further details see Appendix III,paragraphs 11-15*7.     Defence expenditure, which had been reduced following the KoreanWar, was growing slowly in the early years up to 1964-65 at an average annual rate of 1.5 per cent.^-5^   Civil expenditure had been on arising trend in the years before 1959-60, and, with(3)   The rates of increase given for particular programmes do not take account of the relative price effect.   This is included in therates of increase given for public expenditure as a whole, and accounts for about $ per cent per annum spread over the programmes other thanthe capital investment of the nationalised industries etc., and debt interest.4Table 1.1      PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY GROUPS OP PROGRAMMES:1959-60 - 1968-69
5the exception of expenditure relating to commerce and industry, continuedto rise rapidly between then and 1964-65.   Within environmental services,which as a whole rose in this period by an average of 8.8 per cent eachyear, housing (10.7 per cent) and roads and transport (10,0 per cent)rose particularly fast.   Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditure,notably that of the electricity and gas industries and the Post Office,also expanded rapidly in this period, by 4.9 per cent per annum overall.Within the social services, education rose by 5.9 per cent, social security by 4.6 per cent and health and welfare by 3.3 per cent.   Withinthe group of programmes concerned with commerce and industry, regional development policy was beginning and, with other policies for helpingemployment and industry, comprised a programme which was growing in thisperiod at about 12.9 per cent a year on average,8,    Between 1964-65 and 1968-69 changes of policy checked the increasein defence expenditure and by 1968-69 it was falling in real terms.In the civil sector, regional development policy progressed and therewere new measures to modernise and restructure industry.    These wereamong the main developments which made the group of programmes concernedwith commerce and industry grow faster in this period than any othergroup, at an average of 9.0 per cent per annum.   Emphasis was alsoshifted from environmental to social services where expenditure was increased by an average annual rate overall of 6.0 per cent, including4.9 per cent on education, 3.9 per cent on health and welfare and 8.3 percent on social security.   Nationalised industries&apos; capital expenditurerose more slowly, at an average of 2.3 per cent a year overall.   Thiswas mainly because capital expenditure by the electricity industry rosemore slowly and then turned downwards, while investment by the coalindustry and on the railways continued to decrease.9.    The net effect of all these movements was to produce an average annual increase in total public expenditure between 1959-60 and 1964-65of 4.2 per cent, with expenditure rising in both the defence and theI civil sectors; and between 1964-65 and 1968-69 an average annual increaseof 5.9 per cent, with expenditure on defence beginning to fall but civil expenditure, particularly on the social and economic services, risingI faster than before.   Over the period as a whole from 1959-60 to 1968-69,total public expenditure rose at an average annual rate of 5 per cent.
PROSPECTIVE GROWTH OP RESOURCES10.   During the same period 1959-60 to 1968-69 total output (gross domestic product) rose on average by just over 3 per cent a year at constant (196j3) prices.   A rising labour force contributed about one half per cent a year to the increase In output, the balance coming from increasing productivity.11.   During the next few years, little change is expected in the size of the working population, but in 1973 and 1974 the raising of theschool-leaving age will reduce the numbers of young people joining the work force.   Thus rising output can only come from risingproductivity.   It seems that the underlying rate of increase in productivity is now about 3 per cent a year or a little less.12.    &quot;The Task Ahead&quot; envisaged an increase of total output withina range of just under 3 per cent to about 4 per cent a year.    in settling the levels of public expenditure over the next few years the Government have based their decisions on the assumption thatthe rate of growth of the nation&apos;s resources will be at the lower endof this range.    They have made this assumption because they consider itwise to take a cautious view of the resources available.   Despite the marked recent improvement in the country&apos;s overseas earnings, there remains the overriding need to make available a sufficient share ofthese growing resources for maintaining an adequate surplus on thebalance of payments and a higher level of private investment.    But ifexperience were to show that a higher rate of growth could be achieved at the same time as the other objectives of the Government&apos;s economic policies, then it would become a matter for decision how far this additional output should be used to expand public expenditure programmesor in other ways.6

The Government have in the past published limits (7) against which all public expenditure was to be counted except the capitalexpenditure of the nationalised industries and debt interest,though without adjustment for the relative price effect.   expressed at 1969 Survey prices these limits have been:  million1968-69 1 969-70 1 970-711 6098 16256 1 6757The corresponding totals in this White Paper are within these limits,(8)as follows:  million1968-69 1969-70 1970-71158lh ^outturnf&quot;11     1621U (estimate) 16712 (estimate)Mainly because the programmes in 1968-69 were so far within the target -to some extent expenditure provided for In the year was not actuallymet until the following year - the actual increases between 1967-68and 1969-70 are now estimated at about 2? per cent in each year, and between 1969-70 and 1970-71 at about 3i per cent.   Detailed comparisonsbetween the programme estimates for 1969-70 and 1970-71 given in theWhite Paper &quot;Public Expenditure 1968-69 to 1970-71 (Cmnd.3936) of lastFebruary and in this White Paper are shown in Appendix II.(7) &quot;Public Expenditure in 1968-69 and 1969-70&quot; (Cmnd.3515) and&quot;Public Expenditure 1968-69 to 1970-71&quot; (Cmnd.3936).(8)   The composition of these totals is explained in Appendix III,paragraph 17 on page
16.   In Table 1.2 expenditure and receipts are classified under three main headings - Resources; Transfers, Taxation etc; and Assets.The distribution of the contingency reserve, by its nature, cannotbe forecast.    It has been arbitrarily included as a whole underResources since its implications for demand would be greatest if itwere all required for purchases of resources; but some of it might in the event be required for expenditure on either of the other classes.17.   Net expenditure on resources, which is the class having themost powerful effect on demand, is shown in line 3 to rise byk per cent per annum. Of this, about   per cent is attributable tothe contingency reserve and li per cent to the relative price effect.Net expenditure on assets, the category which has the least impact on demand in the short term, is shown in line 11 to rise at an annual rate of a little under 1 per cent; but this is a small element inthe total.   Expenditure on transfers is shown in lines k and 5 asrising by about 1  per cent a year; but the figures will be affectedby whatever decisions are eventually taken on the uprating of social security benefits in the period (see section 17 of Part 2 on social security).18.   The receipts side of the table, unlike the expenditure side,shows projections which do not represent explicit government decisions.   Changes in tax rates are among the main instruments forthe short-term regulation of the economy; there may have to bemodifications in the light of the situation as it develops from yearto year and the Government cannot commit themselves in advance.   Theprojections of receipts are therefore based on certain assumptions.10
These may not in the event be realised; but they indicate the trendas it would be if no further changes were made in the system.Thus the yield of taxes has been calculated on the assumptions that present tax rates and allowances will continue unchanged and thatthe gross national product will grow as postulated.   Changes intax rates which were made in the Budgets of 1968 and 1969 are, ofcourse, allowed for.   National insurance contributions are projectedto rise so as to match, together with the Exchequer supplement,the assumed growth of expenditure on benefits.   Similarly,projections of income from local rates are related to theprojections of expenditure of local authorities and assume thatthe existing system of grants to those authorities continues.19.   The average annual increase in total receipts over the period is estimated on these assumptions at 3&quot;2 per cent.   There is alarge increase, of 9i per cent, in the yield of taxes between1968-69 and 1969-70, shown in line 6; this results partly frombudgetary changes which have already taken place and partly fromthe growth of the economy.   In the following year the rate of increase still owes something to recent changes in tax rates.   Thechange between 1970-71 and 1971-72 is put at about 3 per cent; this increase is not significantly influenced by past changes in taxrates.20.   Line 15 shows the balance between total receipts and totalexpenditure.    In the current financial year the public sector as awhole is forecast to have a surplus of receipts over expenditure ofover  500 million.   In the past the public sector has normally hada deficit financed by borrowing.   The change from a small public sector deficit in 1966-69 to a sizeable surplus in 1969-70 has played an important part in creating the financial conditions necessaryfor achieving a surplus on the balance of payments.11
The prospect is that at existing tax rates total receipts and totalexpenditure will be roughly in balance during the following two years.21.   A second balance is struck in line 10 by excluding transactions in assets (line 13) from total receipts ana total expenditure.Movements in this second balance - the balance of resources,transfers, taxations, etc- constitute a better guide than thebalance of total receipts and total expenditure to the impact ofpublic sector operations on real demand in the short term.   Thisbalance, too, shows a favourable swing of over  1000 millionbetween last year and the current year.   This improvement in thebalance of public sector transactions (other than in assets) hascontributed to the switch of resources into the balance of payments which has already taken place.   Its maintenance over the comingperiod will help to consolidate the improvement in our overseasposition and to set free resources for a further increase in private investment.12
THE PROSPECT FOR PUBLIC EXPENDITURE PROGRAMMES UP TO 1971-7222*     The plans for public expenditure programmes up to 1971-72 showa continuation of the same broad pattern as has been developing over recent years.   The real cost of defence will continue to fall aschanges in defence policy take effect.   At the same time theGovernment are planning for an increase in civil programmes.Environmental and social services increase from 61 per cent oftotal public expenditure in 1968-69 to 64 per cent in 1971-72.   but these developments are planned within a total of public expenditure which will be growing at an average annual rate of 3 per cent, compared with 5 per cent in the last decade.23.     The following table summarises the figures.Table 1.3       PUBLIC EXPENDITURE BY GROUPS OP PROGRAMMES:1968-69   -   1971-72   million1968-69   1969-70   1970-71   1971-72   Averageprovisional estimate estimate estimate  Annualoutturn Percentage m  m  m  m        IncreaseL969 Survey prices (a) (b) (c) (d) (e)Ifence and External Relations   2,772 2,688 2,635 2,565 - 2.6mmerce and Industry 1,498 1,678 1,688 1,697 4.2iyironmental Services 3,223 3,299 3,500 3,699 4.7icial Services 7,317 7,698 8,029 8,311 4.3ier Services 843 902 948 981 5.2Hionalised Industries&apos; etccapital expenditure 1,510 1,439 1,474 1,436 - 1.7sb:t Interest 2,051 2,050 2,050 2,025 - 0.4   &apos;siative Price effect and other adjustments 381 303 345 521itingency Reserve - - 75 175JJ1969-70 Outturn prices      TOTAL 19,595     20,057     20,744     21,410 3.0
2h..   The detail lying behind this summary is set out in thefollowing table, which distinguishes 20 main programmes, most ofwhich comprise a large number of individual projects or services.This classification brings together expenditure of the variousspending authorities - Government, local authorities and public corporations other than nationalised industries - which is directed to single broad objectives, eg education and housing.   The public expenditure of Northern Ireland, and the capital expenditure of nationalised industries are brought together under single headings,and so is debt interest.      Part  2  of this White Paper provides acommentary on each of the programmes.lh

(9)   The aggregates of public expenditure and the individual programmes for each year 1968-69 to 1971-72 are analysed in detail by economiccategory in tables 3.5 and 3.6 on pages25.   The Contingency Reserve, shown in this table in line 25makes provision for new expenditure which may have to be incurredbut the precise nature, scale and timing of which cannot be foreseen.It is also needed to cover any excess over present estimates, inparticular for programmes where expenditure is partly determined byfactors not under the spending authority&apos;s own control, and toprovide an element of flexibility should the economy not develop asis assumed in the plans.   Since these uncertainties increase overtime provision has been made on an increasing scale.26.   An analysis of the programmes by spending authority is givenfor each of the four years in Tables 1 .7 to 1.10 on pages .These tables distinguish those elements of expenditure to be incurred by the Government (showing Vote-financed expenditure separately fromthat financed from the National Insurance Funds and other specialfunds)j by local authorities, and by public corporations including in addition to the nationalised industries, the broadcasting authorities, the new town corporations and a number of otherindividual bodies.27.   The totals of the expenditure of these three groups of spendingauthorities are planned to move as shown in the following tablewhich also distinguishes capital and current expenditure: (9)

m.   Local authorities are responsible for the greater part ofExpenditure, current and capital, on local environmental services (96 perlent), law and order (81 per cent), and housing (79 per cent), - that is,m nearly all the main programmes in the environmental services group which, with an average annual rate of increase of 4-7 per cent (see table 1.3), is the group planned to grow most rapidly in the period,fethin the social services group, local authorities have the major partnof expenditure in education (84 per cent).    These various servicestogether with roads, are also individually the largest to be run by localauthorities.    Together they account for over 90 per cent of localauthorities&apos; expenditure, 40 per cent of it going on education alone.30,   The figures quoted in Table 1.5 for the current expenditure of localmauthorities differ from the figures of relevant expenditure on which rate support grant is paid in Great Britain in that the former include someitems (mainly rate fund contributions to council house rents) which doi not come within &quot;relevant expenditure&quot;, but exclude loan charges andsome other items which do; moreover Table 1.5 covers Northern Ireland[Which is outside the Great Britain rate support grant settlements.    TheI total of Great Britain relevant expenditure to attract rate support grant[in 1969-70 and 1970-71 was determined last winter.    For 1971-72 the[elements of local authority relevant expenditure (other than loan charges)which are included in the programmes imply, when brought together, aIrowth of 4 per cent in real terms above the total which was acceptedMot 1970-71 under the 1968 rate support grant settlement.v    &apos;    This isthe rate of increase which the Government will regard as an acceptableBasis for the next rate support grant determination; and they considershat the resources available to local authorities after such a deter-glination will enable them fully to achieve the programmes which areSmbodied in this White Paper, including as the largest among them theeducation programme.
31.    Capital expenditure by the nationalised industries reflects the changing pattern of demand for the output of the industries concerned.The fastest rising (and soon the biggest) individual programme is thatof the Post Office, to meet the rapid increase in demand fortelecommunications services.    The capital expenditure of the industries as a whole is expected to fall slightly between 1968-69 and 1971-72 asa result of a substantial reduction in capital expenditure by theelectricity industry, which will more than offset rising expenditure byother industries.
CORRIGENDUMTOParagraph 32first sentence&quot;The Government have not yet taken decisions on the levels for individual programmes in1972-73 and 1973-74. hut they are planning onthe basis that the total for public expenditure will be kept within the forecast limits of growthfor the economy as a whole.&quot;
PUBLIC EXPENDITURE IN 1972-73 AND 1973-7432.   The Government have not yet taken firm decisions   on the levels fwrthe individual programmes in 1972-73 and 1973-74, but they are resolved to keep the total of public expenditure within the limits of the expectedgrowth of the economy as a whole.   In the following table there are shown provisional allocations among the programmes of a total of public expenditure which rises by about 3i per cent in both years./fable 1.6 below/33.   All the figures in this table are provisional, and the margins ofestimation vary from one programme to another.   On the one hand, forexample, /references to the Defence Budget and to Overseas Aid, to be drafted after ministers consideration/.   On the other hand, for instance,for a number of programmes information is necessarily incomplete at thisstage:   the Technological Services programme will not be settled untilmuch nearer the time because new technological projects may come forward in the meanwhile which should be considered for places in the programme.The amounts to be spent on other assistance to employment and industry will depend largely on the course of private investment attractinginvestment grants; and those to be spent on support of agriculture willbe settled in successive annual Farm Price Reviews.   Environmental and social services, except social security, involve large expenditures bylocal authorities whose own decisions may affect the amounts to be spentand their distribution between programmes.   The course of expenditure on social security will be mainly determined by the extent of the upratings.34.   Renewed growth in capital expenditure by the nationalised industries is likely in 1972-73 and 1973-74 following four years in which there willhave been little change in the total of this expenditure.   In a number of programmes, for instance,telecommunications, there will be continuingincreases, and the level of capital expenditure by the electricity industry will begin to rise again.

35.   Decisions on the pattern of expenditure in 1972-73 will be takenin next year&apos;s annual review and embodied in the White Paper for thatyear.   At that time provisional allocations will again be made for1973-74, and for a further year 1974-75.   As the programmes are rolledforward in this way each year, and as calls are made on the contingency reserve, changes are to be expected in the individual totals.

IjPART 2        THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMESPart I of this White Paper was concerned with the general prospect forMpublic expenditure.   This Part supplements the broad analysis with more detailed explanation relating to the individual programmes.   A numbermot suggestions put forward by the Select Committee on Procedure in their recent Report have been taken into account.12 - Introduction

In the period up to 1972 defence expenditure is being reduced asa result of the policy changes which have been reported to parliament in the annual Statements on Defence Estimates.    The most important ofthese changes are the reduction of defence commitments East of Suez andthe winding up of military bases in South East Asia and the persian gulf.    The savings in defence expenditure which will be achieved inconsequence will not attain their full extent until 1972 - 73, but the targets which have now been set for the earlier years - 1970 - 71and 1971-72 - reflect continuous efforts to ensure that the new defence policy is carried out in the most efficient and economical mannerpossible.   Thus it has been found possible to reduce expenditure at aquicker rate than was envisaged in January 1968 when the currentpolicy was announced (Cmnd. 3515).    In particular, the target for the Defence Budget in 1970 - 71    is  76   million less than theestimate made in February 1969 (Cmnd.3936 ).    Detailed information about the Defence Budget for 1970-71 and developments in defence plans will be reported to Parliament in the 1970 Statement on defence estimates.

The United States Credits from which theyare financed are treated as receipts in the national accounts.(ii)   Repayments of the Credits and the interest thereon are charged to the Defence Budget when they occurj   but since to includeboth these and the progress payments in the total of public expenditure would involve double counting, the former areoffset by equal but negative entries in line c(ii).2-2 (a)

I,    Since 1967 - 68    there has been a basic aid programme of 205 million a year in cash terms (Le. without adjustment for changes in money values) covering normal multilateral and bilateral aid andtechnical assistance. Some special items of aid expenditure have been undertaken separately in addition-to this programme.2,    Within the basic programme multilateral aid consists ofcontributions to the International Development Association, theUnited Nations   Development Programme and other institutionssuch as the United Nations Children1s Fund, the World Pood programme and the Regional Development Banks for Asia, Africa and Latin America.Bilateral aid by way of grants and loans goes mainly&quot; to commonwealth countries and takes a variety of forms including aid for development projects, assistance towards a general import programme, balance ofpayments support (sometimes including debt relief) and for a fewcountries and on a declining scale, budgetary aid to maintain minimumservices.   Technical assistance is given to a great manydeveloping countries in the form of skilled people to fill executive and advisory appointments, and also by way of Consultancies and research and training in the United Kingdom and overseas.   As opportunity offersSovernment policy is to increase the proportion of aid givenmultilaterally and in the form of technical assistance.   For 1970-71planned expenditure within the basic aid programme is as follows: -Bilateral grants and loansCommonwealth and Dependencies 102 millionForeign 12Multilateral contributions 30itTechnical assistance 40Commonwealth development corporation 11Contingency reserve 10
confidential the figures shown above for the Commonwealth Development Corporationrepresent gross advances by the Ministry of Overseas Development.An adjustment, which may be positive or negative, is made (see line (f)in Table 2.3) to take account of the Corporation1s net investment withjother funds and thus to show the effect of its transactions as a wholeon United Kingdom resources.3.    Of the special items additional to the basic aid programme the! largest is the  75 million of economic aid to Singapore and Malaysiawhich is being provided over five years from 1968-69 to mitigate theeffects of the United Kingdom military withdrawal.   There is alsoprovision for an extra  7 million annually for three years ending in971-72 towards the increased United Kingdom contribution to theSecond Replenishment of the funds of the International development association, and three annual contributions of  6 million from 1968der the Rome Pood Aid Convention.I. In 1968 the Government joined with the governments of other Western^countries who provide aid in accepting a recommendation of the SecondUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) thatIdeveloped countries should endeavour to reach a target of 1 per cent of-&apos;gross national product at market prices for financial flows to developing countries comprising Governmental aid, private investment and guaranteed export credits, all net of capital repayments.   No datelor implementation was given and the United Kingdom&apos;s acceptance of therecommendation was subject to balance of payments considerations.   AllPf the present overseas aid expenditure counts towards the target exceptwhat part of the special aid to Singapore and Malaysia which &apos;may beused to purchase defence equipment.f.    The basic programme of  205 million a year and the additional itemsJill continue in 1969-70 and 1970-71, producing total aid expenditurelof  227 million and  235 million in cash terms in these years, of whichpout  219 million and  228 million (gross) is expected to countONFID-3(b)
towards the UNCTAD target.   For 1971-72, in order to make a move towards the UNCTAD target,the Government has decided to increasegross aid expenditure counting towards the UNCTAD target to  245million in cash terms, and total aid expenditure accordingly to 251 million.   From that year aid expenditure will be treated as onecomprehensive programme, providing for all items of developmentassistance.

1.The expenditure on &quot;Other Overseas Services&quot;shows no significantBend from 1969-70.   Part of the expenditure is governed by international(i)commitments and the Report of the Duncan Committee , whose recomraenda-tions are under consideration by the Government, bears on the remainder.[Overseas Representation.1   Almost all of this expenditure is required to meet the cost of the diplomatic Service, its accommodation and associated expenses inrepresenting British interests internationally.Oyerseas Information.32    This covers three main elements.a. British Council expenditure to promote a wider knowledge of theUnited Kingdom and the English language abroad and to developcloser cultural relations between the United Kingdom andother countries.    (Part of the Council1s expenditure is alsoshown in Table 2.3 Overseas aid).b. The cost of the B.B.C.&apos;s External Services and associatedexpenditure involved in broadcasting news and views to othercountries;    andc. The cost of staff at posts overseas involved in political and commercial information work and of the supporting services ofthe Central Office of Information and the Stationery Office.Other External Relationsh    This expenditure mainly comprises international commitments andsubscriptions, including the United Kingdom&apos;s assessed contributions tothe budgets of the United Nations Organisation and the Organisation forfconomic Co-operation and Development.I.___iT &quot;-Report of the Review Committee on Overseas Representation 1968-69(Cmnd.

The industrial research establishments work for Governmentdepartments, for other public authorities and in support of industry.The total net expenditure of the multi-purpose establishments (theJNational Physical Laboratory, National Engineering Laboratory andjWarren Spring Laboratory) is expected to remain at its present level. AIsmail increase, in expected&apos;at the other, more specialised, establishmentsjto meet growing demands upon them.   All the establishments are being^encouraged to expand work which is directly related to specific needsgin industry, particularly work on repayment.   A proportion of the cost the Ministry&apos;s aviation research and development establishments andPf aerospace research in industry is allocated to this heading becauseV the value of this work to civil industry.   Total net expenditurefoa civil research and development by the Atomic Energy Authoritiy willadually decline.   Within this total, more work is being done at theAuthority&apos;s establishments in support of non-nuclear industry.   Withinthe nuclear field the main emphasis is now on the fast reactor.1 2.5(a)
Direct support for industrial technology3.     Increasing provision is planned for support of the engineering industries and for productivity and information services, which benefita wide range of industries.   The work of the National ResearchDevelopment Corporation on the exploitation of inventions made inGovernment establishments and by the Research Councils, and in helping to finance research and development projects in industry,will be fully maintained.   A ceiling has been placed on the total of grants to the industrial research associations; adjustments of annualgrants to individual associations are being made within the total inaccordance with the priority of their needs as grant agreements come up for reassessment.Category IIk*     The heading &apos; Aircraft projects and assistance&apos; covers expenditureon the development, proving and production of civil aircraft includingthe UK share of the Concorde project.   The heading &quot;Other&apos;  includes the UK contribution to international space programmes; assistance tothe shipbuilding industry; other major industrial support schemes;capital expenditure on major reactor projects and trading and other expenditure of the Atomic Energy Authority.   Whilst a demand for new schemes can be foreseen, the precise timing and scale of expenditure is uncertain.

ffssistance to persons1.    Expenditure on employment services consists of theexpenditure of the Department of Employment and Productivity and theexpenditure of local authorities on services (including the youth-employment service) for which the Department makes grants.   Theciain elements are Departmental administrative costs (including^loysient exchanges, Government training centres and the factory inspectorate), and grants and loans towards training and rehabilitationschemes, and services for the seriously disabled.    Provision is madein the programme for the further development of the placing anddvisory services, both for adults and young persons; a higher levelf assistance towards industrial training, especially in development and intermediate areas; the continued expansion ofGovernment training centres (to about 13,000 places by the end of1972-73) and the introduction of an employment medical advisory service.j1^2.    The estimates for the Redundancy Fund from 1969-70 onwards take inttRecount the effect of the Redundancy Rebates Act 1969 in reducingthe rebates payable to employers from the Fund.Promotion of local employment.    Expenditure on the promotion of local employment consists of loansI-and grants by the Ministry of Technology to firms which provide additionalmployment in the development areas, and the cost of the building of factories and development of industrial estates by the Ministry of technology itself.    Gross expenditure in 1969-70 is expected to beif1?^ million higher than in 1968-69.   The demand for loan finance and.poa smaller extent) the number of large projects going to thedevelopment areas have both increased.   expenditure will continue to rise, largely as a result of the Government&apos;s decisions in assistance to the intermediate areas, but the increase will be to!0me extent offset by increasing receipts from rents and sales.2* 6(a)CONFIDENTIAL
Industrial Reorganisation Corporation4.     The functions of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59)are to promote industrial reorganisation and development in thegeneral interest of the economy.    Its main sources of capital are loans from the National Loans Fund and Public Dividend Capital from a vote of the Minister of Technology; the Corporation pays interest on theformer, and is to make periodic payments of dividend on the latter.The Corporation has made a first dividend payment of  750,000 grossfor 1968-69.5.    Under the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation Act 1966, a limit of  150 million was set to the aggregate of the public funds availableto the 1958-59.    The nature of the IRCs operations, which include support for industrial mergers, the outcome of which depends on the courseof commercial negotiations, makes it difficult to programme its expenditure in advance.    In the longer run, the Corporation isexpected to rely increasingly on revolving its existing capital as a means of re-financing itself, but it will take someyears to build up annual repayments.6.    For these reasons, the estimates in Table 2.6 of the annualphasing of lending by the 1958-59 are tentative.     They show the final 18 million of the  150 million made available by the government under existing legislation as being lent in 1971-72.The Table does not anticipate future legislation by showing anylending in excess of the  150 million.   But the Government intends toenable the 1958-59 to maintain approximately its current level of operations beyond that date, and to introduce legislation in due course to increase the existing limit of  150 million.    Decisions2-6(b)
on the timing of the legislation, on the increase in the limit andon the phasing of drawings against the new limit will he taken nearer the time, in the light of the actual course of the IRCs financialoperations.    Any expenditure beyond the present  150 million ceilingwill he a claim on the contingency reserve.Other specific grants and loans to industry7.     This heading covers Board of Trade services on the promotion oftrade and exports, including expenditure by the Tourist Boards set up under the Development of Tourism Act 1969;  expenditure on the newhotel loans and grants scheme (which is expected to rise to a peak of about  8.5 million in 1971-72); grants to the British NationalExport Council, expenditure on trade fairs; and loans by theNational Film Finance Corporation.    It also includes loans of 31.1 million over the years 1969 to 1971 to the aluminium smeltingcompanies for which the Ministry of Technology is now responsible.Investment grants8,    The figures for investment grants assume that payment in eachyear will be in respect of four quarters&apos; investment expenditure, andthat the standard rate of grant will remain at 20$, and theDevelopment Area rate at 40%.    The figures take account of the latestevidence on the trend in capital investment by industry, theproportion of it that will be eligible for investment grant, and theproportion of it that will attract the higher Development Area rateof grant.   Forecasts of this expenditure have been unavoidablyuncertain as it depends not only on the way in which these factorsdevelop but also on the timing of applications for grant.    It isnow clear that substantial additional grant expenditure will berequired in 1969-70, as compared with previous estimates, and thepresent figure for that year Included in Table 2.6 allows for thefurther provision which, pending a final appraisal, will be proposedin a Winter Supplementary Estimate.2.6(c)CONFIDENTIAL
9.     It is also clear that some of these factors will require a higher level of grant expenditure than had previously been forecast in 1970-71and 1971-72 also.   One factor in this revision of estimates is theexperience gained as to the proportion of industrial investment whichis eligible for grant at the national and Development Area rates of grant under the terms of the scheme.   Another is the higher rate of growth in certain categories of capital expenditure.   Allowance hasnow been made for these factors In the figures for 1971-72, thoughthe revised forecasts remain subject to variation.10.   While the growth in productive investment which the grant schemewas designed to stimulate is to be welcomed, this additional grantexpenditure has entailed a substantial charge on the contingency reservewhich must militate strongly against further measures to increase oraccelerate the flow of grant payments to industry in presentcircumstances.    In the longer term account will have to be taken of current studies on the relative cost effectiveness of the scheme.11.   The bulk of additional payments under the Selective employment tax (SET) arrangements and regional employment premiums are paidby the Department of Employment and Productivity to qualifyingprivate employers in the development areas.   A relatively small amountis paid by other Departments to nationalised industries in respect ofthose parts of their undertakings which qualify in the development areas.   SET additional payments are being abolished with effect from1 April 1970 but because payment is made in arrears some provision is necessary in 1970-71 and, for belated claims, again in 1971-72.The regional employment premium will continue to be paid.Board of Trade and Ministry of Technology services12. The administrative expenses of the Board of Trade on their services to industry and trade, and those of the Ministry of Technology on
investment grants, promotion of local employment and some other services, come under this heading.Assistance to coal industry13.   Under the Coal Industry Act 1967 measures to alleviate socialhardship are due to end in March 1971, although some expenditure willspill over into 1972 and 1973.    It was announced in the Queen&apos;a speech that a Bill will be introduced to continue after March 1971 theGovernments powers under the 1967 Act.    The estimate of  18.8 million for 1971-72 in Table 2.6 takes account of this new commitment.2.6(e)

fohich they support at universities, and by bodies which they aid byIgrants.   They support university research by grants to research workers and by awards to postgraduates for research training and for advancedcourses in science and technology.   Grants for scientific purposes,including international fellowships, are given to the Royal society and to the Royal Society, Edinburgh.&apos;3,    The science budget also covers subscriptions to internationalscientific bodies.    In 1969-70 these amount to  12.2 million.   the science Research Council is responsible for United Kingdomcontributions to the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO),the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) and to the NATOScientific Research and Training Programme;   the Medical Research[Council for the contribution to the International Agency for ResearchI on Cancer;   and the Department of Education and Science for that tolithe European Molecular Biology Conference.m,   The main fields of research covered by the Councils are plants,animals, food and agricultural engineering (ARC);   biological, clinicaland tropical medicine research (MRC);   geology, hydrology;   oceanographyfflarine biology, fisheries and conservation (NERC);   astronomy, spacei and radio nuclear physics, engineering, chemistry and sciences not[covered by the other Councils (SRC).

1,    Table 2.8 above covers most of the expenditure of the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) and the Department of Agricultureand Fisheries for Scotland (DAFS) along with that of the forestry commission, and some minor items of other Departments and localauthorities.Agricultural support2,    This expenditure covers the implementation of the price guarantees,the provision of grants and subsidies to farmers, and the associatedadministrative costs.    There are special difficulties about forecastingthe future cost of agricultural support.    The levels of the guarantees and subsidies will he affected by changes made at futureFarm Price Reviews,   But, even if there were no changes in guaranteed prices, the cost of implementing the guarantees would be liable to markedvariations according to the levels of supply and of market prices.    Thefigures for agricultural support have therefore been prepared on thefollowing conventional basis, and do not attempt to predict futurevariations.3.    The figures for 1969-70 correspond   to the Estimates for the year as submitted to Parliament before the 1969 Price Review, adjusted totake account of the estimated effect of that Review   in that financialyear.   The figures for 1970-71 and subsequent years take account of theestimated full-year effects of the 1969 Price Review but, in most other respects, project an unchanged figure for agricultural support.    Inpractice, the cost of agricultural support may result in higher or lowerexpenditure than the figures in Table 2.8, depending on the factorsdescribed above.Other assistance to agriculture^ This includes the bulk of the remainder of the expenditure of MAT?!1and DAFS on agricultural and horticultural services, and administrative
costs;    it includes the advisory services.    Here again, as with agricultural support, some expenditure has been estimated on aconventional basis with no attempt to predict future variations,e.g. stabilising payments to the bacom curing industry, animal diseasecompensation, payments under the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement.   Theincrease over the forecast period is due mainly to the developmentof policies under the Agriculture Act 1967 in respect of farmamalgamations and rural development policy, and to the modernisation of wholesale horticultural markets.Fisheries5.    This estimate reflects the higher level of support for theindustry authorised by the Sea Fisheries Act 1968.   The amount of support provided from year to year cannot, however, be forecast withaccuracy because it depends on operating results and in the case ofthe inshore fleet on decisions taken by Ministers in an annual review.As part of the Government&apos;s support policy for the industry provision has also been made for a higher level of expenditui-e on grants and loans for vessels and equipment.Forestry6.    The estimate covers support for private and state forestry.The period will see an expansion in the Forestry Commission&apos;s planting programme, particularly in Scotland.

$4.   Table 2.9 covers expenditure by the Government and bylocal authorities.      Government wholly finances the construction,[improvement,   maintenance and lighting of trunk roads(motorways and all-purpose roads) and makes specif ic grants (normally75 per cent) towards the cost of constructing and improving principalroads.    All other expenditure (including maintenance and lighting ofprincipal and non-principal roads, as well as improvement of non-principal roads) is a local responsibility.[2.   The number of vehicles using the roads continues to rise by abouti 5 per cent every year and it is estimated that by the end of 1971-72: nearly half the 5*4-00 miles   of trunk roads will be very heavily loaded.Urban traffic is also steadily increasing.     These factors call for an expanding programme of road expenditure.13,   Continuing improvements to routes which carry the bulk of the; traffic and the relief of urban congestion are essential to promote theeconomic and social well-being not only of the individual regions but of the country as a whole.4.   The planning, design and construction of major road schemes can take seven years or more so that decisions on policy are of a long-term nature.     Current land use and transportation studies willestablish the framework for future public investment in urban road and traffic management schemes.     The $re en Paper  &quot;Roads for thePiture&quot;, published in March 1969, with its new approachj; to inter-urban road planning, seeks to establish guidelines into the; 1980s.    Similarly, in Scotland and Wales future plans have been drawnup after consultation with the interests affected, giving emphasis toI the importance of roads in promoting regional development - see &quot;The[Scottish Economy, 1965-70&quot; (Cmnd. 2864) &quot;Scottish Roads in the 1970s&quot;j(Cmnd. 3953), and &quot;Wales, The Way Ahead&quot; (Cmnd. 3334).
Other expenditure includes provision for research and developmentjmich will reflect the expansion of work on road building and thegreater emphasis being put on road traffic and transportation.    Moreuse will he made of extra-mural research contracts particularly with[industry.16,   Local authority expenditure on improvement and maintenance of roadsI(other than principal roads), lighting and car-parks is expected to riseslightly as a result of some relaxation of the restrictions imposed in1968-69 and 1969-70*   This expenditure is assisted through the rate support grant but is not directly subject to central control.2.9(b)

1,    Table 2.10 covers the main elements of Transport, expenditureexcluding expenditure on Roads, which is covered in Table 2.9.2,    The largest element in the programme is grants toBritish Rail for the maintenance of unremunerative railway passenger services.     However, expenditure of about  62 million in 1969 on these will be gradually reduced as measures are taken to increase operatingefficiency and to close down some services which represent poor value for money.     It is also expected that there will be some assumption offinancial responsibility by local communities for services which they wish to maintain in their areas,3.    Another large element in Government support for British Rail isthe grants which are being paid for a limited period as an incentive to the elimination by the Board of surplus track and signallingcapacity.     This surplus capacity cannot be eliminated overnight anda five year programme has been agreed, now well under way, for itsgradual disposal.     Again, these grants will gradually taper away,from  15 million in 1969 to  5 million in 1973 after which they will cease.4.   A similar system of tapering grants has been instituted in respectof the unprofitable activities which the Nation Freight Corporation (NFC)took pver from British Rail, relating to rail freight, sundries.   TheTransport Act 1968 enables grants to.be made to the NFC of up to 60 million in all towards their losses in this respect in the five years1969 to 1973, and it is intended to run down the grants from the openinglevel of  17 million to a fraction of that amount in 1973, if the. losses have not been eliminated by then.5.   The main element of the Transport programme outside thejnationalised industries is port investment, which is put at about\SA0 miiii0n for each of the years 1970-71 and 1971-72, based on estimates2.10(a)
provided by individual port authorities adjusted in the light ofrecent experience.     In the longer term port investment will dependin the main on the policies of the proposed National Port Authorityannounced in the White Paper on the Re-organisation of the Ports(Cmnd. 3903).     This Authority will control the major ports of thecountry which handle about nine-tenths of seaborne trade of theUnited Kingdom, and will be responsible for &quot;reviewing the investment plans for these ports.   But this is unlikely to affect the pattern of investment much before 1973-74.6.    The Government intend to continue their substantial support of bus operators through the rebate of bus fuel duty, estimated at about 21^ million in 1970-71 and 1971-72.     In addition bus operators areexpected to receive about  8-  million each year through the new busgrant schme introduced by the Government.     Local authorities who make grants for rural bus and ferry services will receive a 50 per centcontribution from the Government.7.    Other major expenditure on public transport will arise from thescheme introduced by the Government to allow grants to be paid to public authorities in respect of expenditure on infrastructure projects which, assist the development of urban passenger transport facilities.Expenditure for this purpose is likely to rise from about  5^ million in 1968-69 to about  12 million in 1970-71 and to some  24  million in 1971-72.    The increase in these expenditures reflects a growingappreciation of the important role of public transport in producingpractical and acceptable solutions to urban transport problems.8.    Prom 1st January 1969 onwards the figures for &quot;other passenger transport&quot; include expenditure by the Greater London Council on london Transport, which for earlier periods is included with thecapital expenditure of the nationalised industries (Table 2.22).2.10(b)
9,    Expenditure on road safety and research is increasing and giving agood return in social and economic terms.   In particular road safetypublicity and road user training is helping to maintain the improvementin road casualty figures which occurred toward the end of 1967.10.   Civil aviation and shipping services cover expenditure ataerodromes operated by the Board of Trade, on air navigation and miscellaneous services provided by the Board, capital expenditure bylocal authorities at municipal aerodromes, Board of Trade expenditureon shipping services, and net loans to the shipping industry.2.10(c)

1,   The figures set out above are broken down into investment in new dwellings together with improvements and net mortgage lendingon the one hand and subsidies on the other.   The estimates ofexpenditure on housing investment in the public sector and improvement grants and mortgage advances to the private sector reflect action taken to increase or improve the housing stock both public and private.   The figures for subsidies do not bear a similarrelationship to work done in the years in question, though they arean essential feature.of housing policies.   These latter figures,as well as those for mortgage advances, are on an outturn price basis,because of the problems which arise in adjusting them to constant prices.(3)Investment and improvements2.   The larger element in these figures represents the capitalexpenditure (mainly financed out of borrowing) on public sector housing by local authorities and new town corporations.   It embracesnew house building, the acquisition of slums for clearance orold houses for improvement, and improvements to the public sector housing stock.   A smaller element consists of payments of improvement grants to the private sector.3*   These estimates are on the basis that approvals of ne^ hemibuilding in the public sector in Great Britain will con time at fc,;about their present level but with some shift of emphasis from neirconstruction to the rehabilitation of older houses following theHousing Act of 1969.   In England, the 135 priority authorities withthe worst housing problems of over-crowding and sluw clearance will\ continue to be allowed to build to capacity and elsewhere priority; will be given to the replacement of slums, overspill and housingfcr old people.

meet the continuing need for new houses to replace slums, to providefor economic growth, and to overcome local shortages and mal-distribution of the existing housing stock.k.    The estimates also include the net cost (after taking accountof repayments received by local authorities in discharge of previousloans) of mortgage lending by local authorities to private persons and housing associations.   New advances by local authorities in1969-70 will be at the  55 million level for England and Walesannounced in July 1969 and the same figure has been included in the1971-72 estimate; this item, however, can be varied more readilythan others and the Government have already announced that the ceiling on new advances by local authorities in 1 970-71 will beincreased by  us million:   the figures take this into account,i Subsidies5.    The subsidy figures in these estimates comprise two elements.The first, and larger, represents subsidy payments by the centralgovernment to local authorities.   These payments are made under a! Beries of Acts, the most recent of which is the Housing SubsidiesI Act 1967.   Under this Act (and the equivalent legislation in] Scotland) subsidies are directed towards the cost of interest on! loans raised by local authorities to finance approved buildingI programmes and are designed to bridge the gap between a h per cent interest rate and representative actual rates of interest.The smaller element consists of contributions from the local authorities&apos; General Rate Funds to lower the level of rents charged.2.11(b)CONFIDENTIAL

1,    The heading * local environmental services&apos; covers a wide variety of services which are almost entirely the responsibility of localauthorities.   They can be divided broadly into the three groups shown under &quot;Capital expenditure&apos; in the table above.   In so far as capitalexpenditure by local authorities is financed by borrowing it requiriesloan sanction from the central government.2,    The first group, which covers basic and essential services, isconcerned with public health and the reduction or removal of pollution.,It includes water supply, sewerage and refuse disposal, miscellaneouspublic health expenditure and clean air policy.   The pressure forincreased expenditure on these services is considerable.   Industrialgrowth, increase in population and improved standards of living create an inescapable and rapidly rising demand for water, sewerage and refusedisposal.   As the scale of these services increases the technical problems also increase and they become more costly.   For instance, the rising demand for water involves getting supplies from less accessiblesources.   It also involves a higher standard of purification of theeffluents discharged into rivers, which in turn means that the replacement of overloaded, out-dated and inefficient sewage purificationplant becomes increasingly urgent.   On refuse disposal, the growingshortage of convenient places for tipping requires increased expenditure on incinerators, plant and vehicles.3.    The second group comprises a variety of services for the improve-oent of the environment.   It includes playing fields and swimming bathsand other recreational areas such as country parks, as well asexpenditure on town and country planning, which is primarily the redevelopment of central urban areas but also the reclamation of dei ,licland.   The administrative costs of local authorities, expenditure oniocal authority offices and on computers also come in here.2.12(a)
1 Despite the strong case for expenditure on this group of services,i they are generally less urgently required than the first group, , andj expenditure on them is expected in total to he kept roughly level in:\ order to allow room for the extra growth required for the first group.I l)..    The third group comprises direct expenditure hy new townI development corporations mainly on industrial and commercialj development.   Other public expenditure on new towns is grouped with[ the main programmes such as roads and housing (water and sewerageI for new towns fall within the first group of local environmentalI services).   The figures for this group show some growth as the working on the more recent of them gathers momentum.! 5.    Similar considerations apply to current expenditure.   TheI figures here are only an estimate of what local authorities inI aggregate will spend and a detailed sub-division is not attempted.2.12(b)

1,    Most expenditure on law and order services is governed by social and demographic considerations such as the levels of crime and traffic, the number of prisoners, the needs of children in public care and the growth of fire risks and in the incidence of fires.   The loadwhich all these impose is increasing and, despite improvements in methods, organisation and equipment, calls for more expenditure,especially on staff in the services concerned.   Most of the expenditure is incurred by local authorities;    the central government contributebyway of the rate support grant, and for certain services (notably the police)   by specific grants.Police2.    The forecasts assume increases in police and civilian strengths(including traffic wardens).Prisons3.    It is assumed that the prison population will continue to rise(from nearly 39,000 at the beginning of the period), that there willbe a progressive increase of staff to deal with the increased population and new establishments; and that capital provision will be made for new prison places to relieve overcrowding and to carry forward the longoverdue modernisation of existing prison buildings.Probation and after-carek*    The estimated increase in expenditure is mainly the result ofan expected increase in the number of probation officers.   Provision,is also made for an annual increase in the number of places involuntary after-care hostels.Child carep.    Expenditure arising from the implementation of the Children andl^young Persons Act 1969 will be first felt in 1970-71.

Most of the increase in expenditure is attributable to the urban programme, a new programme of expenditure on community services in areas of special social need.   This programme also provides the funds for the community development project, which is an experimental projectfk evaluate the social and community services in a limited number ofdeprived areas and to consider how to make these services more effective.Increases in expenditure also arise from the c riminal injuriescompensation scheme as a result of a continued rise which is expected in the number of applications.9.

\,   Table 2.15 above shows details of expenditure on, education andlocal library services in the period 1968-69 to 1971-72.   In 1968-69this expenditure was over  2,200 million - equivalent to more than6 per cent of the size of the gross national product - and localAuthorities, with the help of rate support grant, spent more than10 per cent of it.   These services employ well over one million people,[half of them teachers.12,   This expenditure covers the complete range of provision   fromnursery education to computers for university research.   The maindeterminant of the growth in expenditure is the increase in numbers of pupils and students at every level.   Between 1968-69 and 1971-72total numbers in schools will rise by about 7 per cent - in primary schools by 6 per cent from 5.3h million to 5.66 million and inI secondary schools by over 9 per cent from 3.33 million to 3.63 million.Expenditure incurred to meet these increases needs to be planned wellI in advance;   major decisions on educational expenditure generallyI have their main effect on the education service in the period roughly: four to eight years later.B*   There will be a further large increase in numbers in secondary schools from the beginning of 1973 following the raising of the school leaving age.   The Government has authorised new building work worthfi120 million for this purpose.   This and other capital expenditure onIsecondary schools will help reorganisation on comprehensive lines.I   numbers of students (full-time equivalents) in further and highergtocation as a whole, which embraces the range from part-time dayplease courses to work at postgraduate level, are expected to riseI over 10 per cent between 1968-69 and 1971-72.   Universities and^lieges of education and further education will continue to expand2-15(a)
accordingly.   Between 1967 and 1971 the proportion of the age-groupentering full-time and sandwich courses in higher education isexpected to rise from lh per cent to about 20 per cent.   This expansion and the corresponding contribution from part-time students will increasthe flow of highly qualified manpower to the economy.5,    To maintain standards of provision for rising numbers, current expenditure on schools must rise over the period to 1971-72 by about per cent and on post-school education by rather more than10 per cent.   Table 2.15 shows that current expenditure on primary and secondary schools is expected to rise by 11 per cent and on further and higher education by 15 per cent.   Some margin of] expenditure is therefore available for the improvement of standards.6,    In the schools, the number of qualified teachers available isI expected to rise by 15 per cent between 1968-69 and 1971-72, aboutI twice the rate of increase expected in the number of pupils.   ThisIwill make possible a continued reduction in the number of over-largeclasses, especially in primary schools, a major objective ofeducation policy.   Resources will also continue to be made availablefor the replacement of some old school and university buildings andIto improve facilities in colleges of education and further education,I particularly at the polytechnics.17&apos;   The range of the education services will be widened when the open University&apos;s first courses begin in January 1971.   nursery education In socially deprived areas will benefit under the urban programme^ and there will be a steady growth in expenditure on sport,jthe youth service, adult education and public libraries.(61I ^ee Section 2.13, paragraph 82-15 (b)

1,    About 60 per cent of this expenditure is on hospitals, 22 per centon general practitioner services,  14 per cent on community health and welfare services and 4 per cent on welfare foods and other services.This pattern will broadly continue over the next five years.    Expendi-ture at constant prices on the service as a whole is planned to increase by about 3.0 per cent in 1970-71 over 1969-70 and 4.3 per cent in1971-72 over 1970-71.Hospital capital expenditure2,    Progress in replacing and modernising hospital buildings willcontinue on the lines set out in the Hospital Building Programmej(England and Wales) (Cmnd. 3000) and the Review of the Hospital Plan^or Scotland (Cmnd. 2877).    The programme is intended not only to match the movement and increase in population but also to tackle progressivelythe problem of obsolescence; the total number of beds available will not significantly increase.    Expenditure covers a wide range of schemes[from small projects affecting parts of hospitals, completed in a fewweeks, to new hospitals, taking several years to plan, build and bringlinto use.   Maximum value for money is sought through control of costsjand the setting of standards.    Work on the introduction of industralisedSbuilding techniques and the use of standard designs is being developed.Hospital running costs5.    It is expected that the numbers of in-patients treated will continueto increase at a rate of about 3 per cent per annum during the period,&quot;it that this can be met without increase in the number of beds byImprovements in efficiency.    The cost of the hospital services willcontinue to rise with the increasing use of drugs and supporting servicesIPen. as pathology and X-rays, the use of new forms of treatment, theprovision of improved facilities, and the&quot; need to devote more resourcesJ10 hitherto deprived classes of patients, particularly the mentallyijandicapped.   The cost of staff represents about 70 per cent of the total
expenditure on running hospitala, and increased automation and improved training and deployment will enable them to be used to thelest advantage.   The numbers of highly trained and senior staff to run the service are largely determined by decisions taken years before, andihe training arrangements will be directed to ensuring that the numbers and quality of staff required in the late 1970s and the 1980s areavailable.    These aims can be achieved only through continuing attentionlo savings which can be made by increasing productivity, economy in theuse of resources and by improved efficiency in organisation, management,and the deployment of services.Eamily practitioner services\,    This heading covers general practitioner, pharmaceutical, dentaland ophthalmic services provided under the National Health Service,Expenditure is largely determined by the demand for treatment and the developing capacity to meet it.    Increased provision reflects small increases in the number of doctors and dentists; improvements in theirpractice arrangements which enable more and better treatment to begiven; and the tendency for prescription numbers to increase and for(7)more effective, and usually dearer, drugs to be developed.Community health and welfare services.    It is expected that the main growth points in these local authority services will be the building of health centres, which an increasing number of general practitioners are using, and the development ox&apos; those services which particularly meet the needs of the mentally disordered,pe elderly and the handicapped.   About half the capital expenditure under this heading will continue to go to providing homes for the elderly.I ^The dental and ophthalmic services would have cost more but forincreased charges for dentures and lenses introduced in August 1969.16(b)

i     The schemes of social security cash benefits make up the largestof the public expenditure programmes.   National insurance benefits(principally retirement pensions) account for over two-thirds of totalexpenditure on these schemes.    The non-contributory schemes, financedwholly from general taxation and consisting of war pensions,supplementary benefits and family allowances, make up the balance apartfrom administration.2,    Table 2*17 above shows., on /the basis of existing benefit levels,the estimated distribution of expenditure between the various benefitsup to 19.71-72, compared with how it was distributed in 1968-69.Demographic factors3,   At present there are 7.1 million retirement pensioners; by the endnf 1972, because of increasing numbers of old people, with a largerIproportion entitled to pension, and because of a continuing trend towards earlier retirement, as well as lighter mortality, there areexpected to be 7*6 million.   At present there are 6.9 million childrenfor whom family allowances are payable;   by 1972 it is expected thatthere will be 7.1+ million.    In the field of short-term benefits,allowance has had to be made for an underlying upward trend insickness benefit claims.   For all these reasons there would, a stable 2.17 illustrates, be a substantial increase in the future costfof social security benefits even apart from changes in the levels ofBenefit.(Increases and improvements6*   The Government&apos;s policy is to maintain the value of contributory benefits 3114 ^0 d-0 everything possible to ensure thatI Pensioners and other beneficiaries should continue to share in theBption&apos;s rising living standards.    It is not however practicable to1precast the exact date and amount of future benefit increases, which
have to be settled in the light of the circumstances prevailing at thetime.   The forecasts of social security expenditure in Table 2.17,while taking full account of all the known demographic factors andof the new earnings related schemev   ,   are therefore,purely.!illustrative so&apos; far as levels of benefit are concerned.    Theyindicate how costs would, rise even.at existing levels of benefit,and do not of course imply that benefits will stay at the same levelduring the period under review,5,    Unlike the other major public expenditure programmes a decision toichange the levels of social security benefit (as distinct from thejfundamental structure of the scheme) need only be taken a few monthsjbefore the new rate is payable.   The rates can therefore be adjusted tojtake account of the growth in national income and the developing needsjof the community.   But increased expenditure on social security benefitjhas to be met by higher insurance contributions and taxation raisedifrom the  nation   as a whole.   The extent to which it will be possiblejto make further real improvements in the level of benefits, over and1 (9)above expenditure required to take account of price movements     , there-ore depends on the rate of growth of the national wealth; and such^improvements represent an important potential call on the contingency reserve.National Superannuationj6.

The largest part of the MPBW expenditure relates to office buildings, with smaller provisions for Government training centres,scientific and research buildings and building research anddevelopment work, museums and galleries and miscellaneous buildingssuch as the Royal Mint and the Stationery Office.2.    Three quarters of the total relates to current; expenditure,including rents, rates, maintenance, running costs of government buildings and also staff costs.   As regards the rest, of the1*39*1 million forecast for 1971-72 new buildings account for 3h.7 million.   The increase in total expenditure is largelyattributable to an increase in expenditure on new building work,[mainly for computer centres and other office buildings.   A considerablenumber of computer centre projects is   in hand.   A programme to buildnine regional computer centres for the Inland Revenue was announced[recently.   Besides providing a more efficient service this programme is expected to save eventually about 6,000 staff.   Expenditure onjother offices provides for schemes to carry out the Government&apos;aipolicy of dispeirsing staff from London, to house additional staff andjto replace accommodation which is sub-standard or uneconomic.Stationery Office.3*    The figures show expenditure by the Stationery Office to meetthe requirements of Government Departments, together with theptationery Office&apos;s administrative and other costs.

i,   The public expenditure estimates for Northern Ireland which areghovm in Table 2.21 above have been prepared by the Northern IrelandDepartments.   The Northern Ireland Government is responsible for thedministration of these services and the expenditure is not subject to detailed control from Westminster.   The bulk of the expenditure is metLorn Northern Ireland&apos;s assigned share of United Kingdom taxation, butthis revenue is supplemented in particular cases under agreed arrange-&quot;pents.   The level of expenditure on these services is in generaldetermined on the basis of parity of services between Northern Irelandand Great Britain.   However, expenditure on assistance to industry andiemployment is related to the level of unemployment in Northern Ireland,Ihich has been persistently much higher than in the development areasof Great Britain.The figures in table 2.21 represent public expenditure for whichthe Northern Ireland Government is responsible, and do not thereforeInclude expenditure on such items as defence and most agriculturalIsupport, which is contained in the relevant United Kingdom programmes.Ifee figures include the increase in public expenditure inHorthern Ireland announced in the Communique issued following discussionsIjetween the Home Secretary and the Northern Ireland Governmentjcmnd. 4178).21(a)

1,    The capital expenditure of the nationalised industries has been rising in the past decade and is expected to continue at much thepresent level from 1969-70 to 1971-72.   An upward trend is expectedagain thereafter.   This overall pattern is the net result of a numberof changes in the main programmes.Telecommunications2,    Demand for telecommunications, both inland and overseas, requires ahigh and rising level of investment throughout the period.    The main objective will continue to be the improvement of the quality of service.In addition to the growth of traffic and the connection of new customers,the capital programme caters for further modernisation, the expansion ofthe data transmission service and measures to aid productivity.    Theestimates include provision for coverting the few remaining manualtelephone exchanges to automatic working and extending subscriber trunkdialling (STD) to all customers.Fuel3,    Investment by the fuel industries is expected to decline untilj 1972-73.   Within this pattern the National Coal Board&apos;s investment is likely to remain at about present levels (subject to the developmentof its participation in oil and gas exploration).4.    Electricity investment consists of a fairly steady rate ofexpenditure on the distribution system and a variable element ofexpenditure on generation and transmission.   The latter is likely toI SO on falling until about 1972, while demand for electricity inEngland and Wales moves into balance with the plant expected to beavailable.   The forecasts allow for ordering two new power stations in1970 - Heysham in England and one in the west of Scotland.   TheGovernment have recently approved the inclusion of stations at Drax and
Sizewellf and the Isle of Grain, in the Central Electricity GeneratorsBoard&apos;s longer term programme.    The case for starting a secondstation in England in 1970 will be reviewed early next year.    The timing of later orders will be considered subsequently in the light of thedemand forecasts and other relevant factors,5,    The gas industry1s expenditure is directed to the rapid introduc-tion of natural gas through the establishment of a pipeline system for transmission of the gas and the conversion of consumers&apos; equipment to use it:    expenditure is expected to reach a peak in 1970-71 and to fall away gradually thereafter.Steel6,    The British Steel Corporation^ investment plans for the longterm are still tenative and the estimates shown in Table 22 arepreliminary figures.    Some increase from the present level ofexpenditure seems likely in the next few years.Transport7.    The re-equipment of the two state airelines is forecast to resultin BEA&apos;s expenditure peaking in the middle of the period, and BOACsrunning at a high level from 1970-71 onwards and rising to a peak at theend of the period,8.    The investment of the other parts of the nationalised transportsector will probably continue at a steady level throughout the period.The proposed nationalisation of much of the ports industry will in due course have the effect of including the investment of the major ports in the figures for the nationalised industries sector, but this will not of course add to the total real demand on resources.9-    Of the other major transport undertakings, the National freight corporation will direct much of its investment to replacing vehicles2.22(b)
but some also to making profitable use of opportunities as they arise.The National Bus Company is also concerned mainly with vehicleprogrammes, with their buses needing replacement at a fairly even rate.Much of the annual investment of the Scottish Transport Group also is devoted to replacing buses but in addition they have a steady programmeof expenditure on new ships to modernise the fleets serving the Clydeand the Western Islands of Scotland.10,   The future course of British Rail&apos;s investment will depend on thedevelopment of the Board&apos;s corporate planning; in the meantime it is assumed that railway investment will continue at about the same rate as for the last few years.Shortfall11.   For the nationalised industries as a whole, experience shows that capital expenditure in the aggregate tends to fall short of the approvedfigures.   For the purpose of forecasting total investment by the nationalised industries, therefore, reductions (shown as &quot;shortfall&quot;)of  100 million in 1969-70,  125 million in 1970-71 and  150 million in1971-72 have been made from the aggregate of total expenditure on fixed assets by the individual industries given in Table 2.22.2.22(c)

Table 2.23 provides separate expenditure figures relating tovices in Scotland for which the Secretary of State&apos;s departments directly or indirectly responsible.   Besides expenditure on nationalvices such as defence, overseas aid, technological assistance andial security for which allocations are possible only on an arbitrayis, they exclude investment by Great Britain Departments and theionalised industries in Scotland.The Scottish figures show differences in the pattern ofenditure by comparison with Great Britain as a whole, correspondingdifferences in circumstances and needs.   One of the mainferences is in housing.   Because of Scotland&apos;s reliance on rentedsing and because the housing programme is being maintained at a level to meet the needs of slum clearance, urban renewal andUBtrial relocation, Scotland has a proportionately large sharepublic sector housing investment.The responsibilities of the Secretary of State&apos;sartments in relation to civil defence, roads and public lighting,sing and local environmental services is virtually the same as thosethe corresponding English Ministries.   Differences in the coverageother expenditure blocks are (briefly) as follows:-Transport:   The Scottish figures cover only rural bus and ferrygrants, infrastructure expenditure, support to theScottish Transport Group, certain shipping companies,and departmental administration.   They do not includefuel grants, new bus grants, support to British Railthe National Freight Corporation, the British WaterwaysBoard, the Port Authorities and civil aviation.2.23(a)
Other assistance to employment and industry:    The figures relateonly to assistance to the coal industry (by way of grants to the two Scottish Electricity Boards forusing extra coal) and to expenditure by the highlands and Islands Development Board and the Scottish TouristBoard.   They exclude Redundancy Fund payments, SETadditional payments, payments of regional employmentpremiums, investment grants and certain other grants.Research Councils:   The figures cover only agricultural research in Scotland financed from Scottish Votes;    they do not include Scotland&apos;s share of expenditure from the science, Social Science, Medical, Agricultural, and natural Environmental Research Councils.Agriculture, fisheries and forestry:    This includes the Scottishshare of the costs of agricultural support and other agricultural and fishing services met separately by theDepartment of Agriculture and Fisheries for Scotland.Other expenditure on agricultural support and on animal health services which is met by the Ministry ofAgriculture Fisheries and Food is excluded, as well asexpenditure by the Forestry Commission.Education and local libraries:    The figures include all expenditure by the Scottish Education Department andlocal authorities, including expenditure on schools,further education, teacher training, youth service etc.Expenditure by the University Grants Committee inScotland is excluded.2.23(b)
Responsibility in respect of social work services, exercised ingland partly by the Home Office under the law and order head andrtly by the Department of Health and Social Security under the health and welfare head, is now grouped together in Scotland in view of thejetting up of local authority social work departments with effect from 17 November 1969 &apos;and the coming into operation (sometime towardsthe end of 1970-71) of the new system of children&apos;s hearings to replace the juvenile courts under Part III of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.Total expenditure on social work services is expected to rise from just over l7im in 1969-70 to about  20m in 1971-72.   In all tables in this white Paper, however, this expenditure falls partly under law and orderBnd partly under health and welfare.5*   Scotland&apos;s share of the nationalised industries&apos; total investmenti9 covered by the Great Britain figures in Table 2.22.2.23(c)

Expenditure within the Secretary of State&apos;a responsibility
The expenditure figures for Wales in Table 2.2U belate solely to services for which the Secretary of State is responsible.   they include not only expenditure which is the direct responsibility ofhis Department but also expenditure by local authorities, hospitalsLa other agencies operating in Wales, for which the Secretary ofState has indirect responsibility.I,   Table 2.24 shows that this expenditure was  208 million in1968-69.      It is expected to increase to  237 million in 1971-72.Nearly 50% of the total is expenditure by the Welsh Office, theremainder being expenditure incurred by local authorities and theother public bodies concerned.   Where there are differences in the pattern of expenditure in Wales compared with that for Great britain as a whole, they correspond with differences in circumstances and needs.3.   The table does not show the full extent of public expenditureIn Wales.   Other Government expenditure (for example, on education and social security) and expenditure by the nationalised industries are also of great importance to Wales and are of concern to theSecretary of State in view of his responsibilities for the oversightof Government activities in general throughout the Principality.Arrangements have therefore been made, to enable the Secretary of8jtate not only to look at his own programmes in relation to thecorresponding English and Scottish programmes but also to take alew of the Welsh parts of other Ministers&apos; programmes.1*   The Secretary of state  s responsibilities in relation to roadsjd public lighting, Housing, local environmental services and health^d welfare are virtually the same as those of the corresponding%liah Ministers.I 2.2h(a)
,   The figures for &quot;other expenditure&quot; relate to a variety of items such as rural bus and ferry grants and infrastructure expenditure3D transport, the expenditure by the Wales Tourist   Board, and grants to the National Library of Wales and the National Museum of Wales.Key do not include expenditure for which the Ministry of transport the Board of Trade are responsible in support of British Rail,tile National Freight Corporation, the British Waterways Board, thePort Authorities and Civil Aviation.   Nor do they include Redundancyfind payments, SET additional payments, payments of regional employment premiums, investment grants or certain other grants.2.2U(b)
AI-1*f APPENDIX ITiOflAL AUTHORITIES&apos; FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE government ,   There are 1210 operating units of local government in England,234 in Scotland and 181 in Wales, and together with the localauthorities in Northern Ireland they are responsible for some 30 perlent of total public expenditure.   The great bulk of this expenditure is incurred by a relatively few large authorities; for example over two-thirds of total local authority expenditure in England is theresponsibility of less than one-seventh of the total number of^authorities.2,   local authorities are in the first instance responsible for most ofthe expenditure on roads (other than trunk roads), housing, localenvironmental services, law and order and (largest of all) education.P,   Many aspects of local government will be affected by there organisation which is to take place in England and in Scotlandfollowing the reports of the two Royal Commissions on Local Government,aid also in Wales.4i   The present financial arrangements between the central governmentand local authorities differ between capital expenditure and current expenditure, with closer control over capital.   All such expenditureinitiated by local authorities on projects financed by borrowing requiresloan sanction.   In some major programmes - housing and schools - a specific approval is also needed for the start of projects.    capital grants for principal roads are approved for individual schemes.   most other projects do not receive capital grants, but the Government meets asubstantial part of the cost through continuing annual grants towardsfce Merest charges on the borrowing from which the. projects are^ced.   There are special Government subsidies towards the interest
glares incurred on housing; these subsidies, together with other government subsidies and the subsidies paid from the rates to balance thelocal authorities&apos; housing revenue accounts, are shown in the subsidiesIgures in Table 2.11, with the capital costs of new houses shown underleheading &quot;Investment and improvements&quot;.   Interest charges resultingIon other capital programmes count as part of the revenue expenditureliich receives rate support grant under the arrangements explained inparagraph 6 below; these interest charges are not, however, apportionedI the tables for the various functional programmes.%&apos; It is far from easy to translate programmes of these capital projects[Into forecasts of annual expenditure. Generally speaking the estimates of be phasing of the expenditure year by year are worked out by Departmentsfrom their central experience rather than provided by the local authoritieshemselves. It is hoped that the development of the relationships between departments and local authorities following reorganisation will facilitatepproved arrangements for forward programmes.I,] Estimates of the total revenue expenditure of local authorities asI whole are discussed with the local authority associations for therapose of determining - rate support grant.   These determinations takepace every other year for the coming two-year period.   The last waspde in 1968 in respect of 1969-70 and 1970-71; the next is due to bepdenext year, in respect of 1971-72 and 1972-73.   The total figuresped in such determinations are accompanied by forecasts of the revenueIpditure expected to be incurred on each of the functional programmes,I &quot;dividual local authorities are thereafter expected to be guided byI ,s indication of relative priorities.   However, the actual amount ofpnue exPenditure incurred by an individual local authority, whetherPaced from its rate revenue or from rate support grant, and theffiled allocation of this total between individual services, are inlhands of that authority.
APPENDIX II.COMPARISON. WITH PAST PUBLISHED ESTIMATES OPFORWARD programmes,    The following table compares the estimates in this white paper of expenditure in 1969-70 and 1970-71 with those given forthe corresponding categories of expenditure in the White Paper ofFebruary 1969 &quot;Public Expenditure, 1968-69 to 1970-71&quot; (Cmnd.3936)revalued at 1969 Survey prices.2.    Of the larger changes in 1969-70, the estimate for &quot;other assistance to Employment and Industry&quot; incorporates a revised estimate of the proportion of manufacturing Investment eligible for investment grant.   The increase in the estimate for Agriculture,Fisheries and Forestry is largely attributable to the 1969 farm price Review.   As against these Increases in 1969-70, there are lower estimates for &quot;Other Military Defence&quot; (a re-phasing of progress payments on U.S.-built military aircraft, together withan overall reduction in the cost of the programme) and LocalEnvironmental Services (new information on expenditure by localauthorities).   The small net increase in the provision for identifiedexpenditure programme has been met from the Contingency Reservewhich originally stood at  75 million.3*    As regards 1970-71 , there are, for the reasons explained in the preceding paragraph, increases for &quot;Other Military Defence&quot;,&quot;Other Assistance to Employment and Industry&quot; and &quot;Agriculture,Fisheries and Forestry&quot;.   But these are offset by reductions,including a reduction of  76 million in the Defence Budget, whichthe Government have made in the plans for other programmes.

NOTES ON METHODOLOGYI,   These notes explain the conventions and classifications used In theIhite Paper.   A fuller account of the principles underlying thispresentation and of certain technical aspects of it is given in theOovernmenfs Green Paper of April, 19^9*      particularly in Appendix II.definitions and Coverageif,    In order that the figures can be consistent as far as possible withjfhe statistics and forecasts of national income and expenditure, theyfollow the methods, sources and definitions which the central statistical Office use for public sector transactions in the national( 2)income accounts.    &apos;   The public sector comprises central government(including the National Insurance Funds), local authorities and public corporations (including the nationalised Industries).   Apart from trans-lotions on operating account by the nationalised Industries and othertrading bodies, all current and capital transactions are covered,fransfers between the public sector and other sectors are included butinternal transfers, such as central government grants and loans to localauthorities and public corporations, are generally eliminated.    Indirectlaxes, including selective employment tax, paid by public bodies   areincluded as part of the cost of the programmes to which they relate andare credited as receipts by the authority to which they accrue.Subsidies to public authorities&apos; trading services and to public corpora-tiona are also included, since they are paid to their operating accounts.3.   The figures in this White Paper exclude imputed rents which are used in the national income statistics to measure the value of the useglade of publicly-owned fixed capital assets In the provision of publicgjjervicesj   this is because of the difficulties of estimation anddeficiencies of coverage.    Since imputed rents would be entered both asa receipt and a payment, their inclusion would make no difference to theI figures for the balances in the tables which show both receipts andexpenditure by the public sector.1 ^   At the back of the Blue Book, &quot;National Income and Expenditure&quot;, aI *able lowing the Treasury analysis of public expenditure provides figuresI for past financial years on a basis which is consistent with the calendarpar figures shown elsewhere in the Blue Book.   Expenditure in. 8 table is analysed by programmes according to the classificationf^by the Government for taking decisions on public__ft) ihj,,.,,I   miic Expenditure:   A New Presentation,&quot; Cmnd U01 7Ascribed in &quot;National Accounts Statistics:   Sources and Methods&quot;COMFmSNlTIAL HMSO, 1968APPENDIX III
expenditure.   The same classification is used in the tables analysingExpenditure by programmes in the White Paper.Price Basis5,      The Blue Book shows expenditure for the past at outturn (orcurrent) prices; that is, the actual prices at which expenditure was incurred during the year in question.   But for the purpose ofGovernment decisions the forward estimates are made on a constant price basis.   This enables comparisons to be made of changes indemands on resources arising, directly or indirectly, from public expenditure in successive years, and the growth of total public expenditure to be related to what is acceptable in the light of the likely growth of the economy as a whole.6.     The estimates of current expenditure on goods and services are on a similar price basis to that used in the 1969-70 Supply Estimates,apart from the increase in rates of selective employment tax intro-duced in the April 1969 Budget.     Those for gross domestic fixed capital formation are mostly at March 1969 prices.In some cases, however, such as roads and education, they relate tothe price basis currently in use for planning purposes, which maydiffer from March 1969.7.     The expression of transfer payments - payments which do notI involve a direct purchase of goods and services - at constant prices cau\ only be on an arbitrary basis: for example, relating them to general purchasing power.    Some grants and subsidies, such as grants toj universities and the aid programme, are in fact expressed in moneyIterms, that is, at the amount expected to be disbursed in each year,irrespective of price changes which may by then have occurred.   although this treatment progressively overstates the demands on resources which such money expenditure would transfer, there is nothing in the changeI in the amount of money being provided from year to year that can beI specifically attributed^o the effect of price changes.   An overallj adjustment related to/estimated movement in the price level of theoutput of the economy as a whole^is therefore included in the line i &quot;Native price effect and other adjustments&quot; in the relevant tables.Social security benefits are treated differently, in the mannerexplained below.   Where subsidies are intended to reimburse deficits,t&amp;e estimates may be entirely notional.   Agricultural subsidies aretae most important example.   The estimates of debt interest are&apos;as measured by gross domestic product at factor cost
CONFIDENTIALprojections at outturn prices deflated to constant prices by the ice deflator applicable to the gross domestic product.3,     For reasons explained in paragraph 30 of the Green Paperestimates of public sector receipts are in some tables set alongside the estimates of expenditure.   Taxes and other receipts (other thansocial security contributions), including charges for goods and services, have in the first instance been estimated at outturn prices.They have then been deflated to estimated 1969-70 outturn prices in themanner described for those items of expenditure originally estimatedat outturn prices,9,    In all the tables showing expenditure by programmes social security benefits are expressed in terms of existing levels of benefit6ince, as explained in Section 2,17, it is not practicable to\ forecast the exact date and amount of future benefit increases.     But1 in order that the total of public expenditure will provide a measure1 of the estimated demand on resources the line &quot;Relative price effectively and other adjustments&quot; contains a net entry for social security  comprising two elements - (a) a downward adjustment relating to forecast movement in prices and (b) a notional upwardadjustment for biennial upratings on account of such price movements.; On the receipts side social security contributions have been calculated in a similar manner.   The entries against this item reflect the continuation of existing rates of contributions, and a netadjustment to allow for movements in prices and a notional1 biennial uprating is made in the line &quot;Other receipts&quot; in Text Table 1.2and in the line &quot;Taxes and other unallocated receipts&quot; in Tables 1.7to 1.10.10.   In order that estimated receipts may be compared with estimated expenditure on a consistent price basis a further overall adjustment,included within &quot;Relative price effect and other adjustments&quot;, convertsthe expenditure figures at 1969 Survey prices to estimated 1969-70outturn prices.Relative Price effect the definition of constant prices applied to the measurementof Public expenditure described above follows that used in thenational income statistics.   This means that no account is taken of possible increases in rates of pay beyond the sum already agreed for financial year 1969-70 - and reflected in the 1969-70 Supplys mates.      The output of those employed in the public
Mctor is taken as equal to their pay;   productivity and pay are taken&quot; constant.\2, As a result of the use of this convention, the estimates of public expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product at constant prices will progressively understate what the proportion would be at current prices.   This is because increases in productivity in theprivate sector will be reflected in increased output at constant prices,while increases in productivity in the public sector will be ignoredexcept in cases where a given task is performed by fewer staff.Furthermore, rising productivity in the private sector will be accompanied by rising real earnings which tend to be matched by public sector real earnings if the desired distribution of the labour force is to be maintained.13,  One way of making allowance for this situation is to add to the constant price series a growing amount equal to the expected futuredifference (derived from past trends) between the share in total outputof public expenditure on current goods and services at current pricesland its share at constant prices.   Approximate calculations suggest thatIthis difference is of the order of 1^ to 2 per cent a year of public expenditure at factor cost on current goods and services.   The relativesize of the difference has, however, varied from year to year and may be^expected to continue to do so.   This is the basis of the adjustment forthe &quot;relative price effect&quot; insofar as it applies to public consumption(current expenditure on goods and services).    It has not yet proved possible to allocate it by programmes, though clearly the programmes which involve employing relatively large numbers of people, e.g. health and education will account for most of it,   A similar adjustment hasbeen applied to those transfer payments which have been classified asresourees(4).   The relative prices of other expenditures may also movedifferentially and adjustments should in theory be made for these.   Butin practice the size of the corrections is not likely to be significantsome of them may be in a downward direction;   no allowance has,[therefore, been made for them.p* The end product of all these adjustments is a set offlections which discount the effect of general price changes, as^ See paragraph 18 below.A II1-4
do all constant price estimates, but also attempt to allow for changesi iin relative prices which projections of quantities and of employmentalone cannot do.Presentation of adjustments15,  The estimates for individual programmes have been entered in the detailed tables of Part 2 without any of the adjustments described inthe preceding paragraphs.   They have been carried through on the sameprice basis into the summary tables in Parts 1 and 3*   With the[exception of overseas aid and social security these estimates are[referred to as &quot;at 1969 Survey prices&quot;.   The line &quot;Relative price!effect and other adjustments in the summary table includes all the adjustments necessary to convert the expenditure estimates to 1969-70outturn prices, the basis on which the totals of public expenditure are expressed.   The adjustment line also includes an allowance for shortfall in the years 1969-70 and 1970-71 and for statistical adjustments (timing;and roundings) o   The allowance for shortfall is included to correct atendency towards over-estimation of the figures in the early years ofthe period ahead.   The total adjustment shown in the tables for theyears 1968-69 to 1971-72 is made up as follows:  million11.   Adjustment of cash pro-grammes to constant prices(i)2.

As explained in paragraph 34 of the Green Paper, in order to giveabroad indication of the use of resources implied by different types ofpublic expenditure, the relevant transactions are set out in three;groups - resources, transfers, taxation etc., and assets.   The principleslunderlying the allocation of items to these three groups are described inParagraphs 3 to 5 of Appendix II to the Green Paper.   The actualallocation used for the purpose of this White Paper, given below, islonsonant with the present availability of data on public sector receiptsPA expenditure.

$otribution of expenditure and receipts to programmes19,    All expenditure, irrespective of the authority by which it is incurred, has been allocated in the tables to one or other of twentyfunctional programmes.   The public expenditure of Northern Irelandand the capital expenditure by the nationalised industries (includingthe broadcasting authorities and the Covent Garden Market Authority)are brought together under single headings; and so is debt interest.In Tables 1.7 to 1.10 all receipts from sales and charges andfrom contributions (national insurance, national health and RedundancyFund) have been allocated to programmes and as far as possibleearnings (trading surpluses, rent, dividends and interest) have alsobeen attributed to programmes in accordance with the allocation of! the associated expenditure on assets.   A relatively small amount of rent, dividends and interest, which it is not possible to allocate,is included   with receipts from taxation and certain othermiscellaneous items of revenue in the line &quot;Taxes and otherunallocated receipts&quot;.20.    In the case of nationalised industries and other publicenterprises, gross trading surpluses have to provide for interest charges on capital and (where appropriate) tax payments.   Thisreduces the amount available to the public enterprise for grosscapital formation.   In order that their residual financingrequirement should not be understated and that the expenditure totalsshould correspond with previous presentations, the appropriateinterest and tax payments have been deducted from the tradingsurpluses and entered among unallocated receipts.21.   Expenditure on overseas aid is included within line 1 of category (A) in Table 1.2 net of loan service payments:    it represents the net resource cost of this expenditure within the continuing aid programme.   In the figures of total public expenditure (line 14 ofJable 1.2, and in the other tables of the White Paper where this totalappears) overseas aid expenditure is included gross of loan service\Payments; this is the basis on which the programme is plannedA III-. 8

The remainder ofpublic expenditure on overseas aid - i.e. the balance between thefigures in line 1 and those in line 1h of Table 1 .2 - is includedline k of category (B) of that table; and line 8 of that tableincludes the corresponding amount received in repayments of capital and payments of interest on earlier aid loans.   This treatment ofexpenditure on overseas aid is also followed in Tables 1.7 to 1.10.
