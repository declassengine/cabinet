WHITE PAPER ON PRODUCTIVITY, PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY AFTER 1969

Note by the First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity

I circulate herewith a proof copy of the White Paper. The White Paper was considered by the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Future Prices and Incomes Policy on Thursday, 4th December. Most of the amendments agreed by the Sub-Committee are now included. One or two additional drafting amendments were agreed by the Sub-Committee and will appear in the final printed version.

2. The printed proofs do not contain Section F dealing with Guidance on Prices and Charges. This is because the Ministerial Sub-Committee decided that officials of the Departments most directly concerned should be asked to redraft this section. Agreement has been reached between officials of those Departments on a text. I am circulating this herewith and would propose to my colleagues that we should adopt this agreed text for inclusion in the White Paper.

3. There is one further point on prices. When I saw the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) this morning, they pressed me strongly to agree that a review should be held of the goods covered by the "early warning" system in order to exclude those products which, in their view, are subject to competitive forces and thus not in need of price surveillance. They asked that this should be stated in the White Paper and that the list of products at present covered which appears in Appendix 2 should be deleted. Clearly we cannot agree to a review now on the basis sought by the CBI and I think we should say so. We will, need, however, to review the "early warning" arrangements in the context of the establishment of the Commission on Industry and Manpower (CIM), and it might soften our rejection of the CBI&apos;s request if we include a reference to this in the White Paper. Both points might be met by adding the


following at the end of paragraph 31*&quot;Tho Government considers that it would he right for the present arrangements to continue unchanged, or with only minor modifications in tho period until the establishment of the CIM.     It proposes,however,   to review the arrangements for oarly warning with those concerned in the context of tho establishment of the CIM in orderto make appropriate longer term arrangements *&quot;Having declared our intention of not reviewing tho &quot;early warning&quot; listnow, I think we could consider mooting the CBI&apos;s subsidiary point bydropping tho list itself from Appendix 2.4.     ELnally,the Ministerial Sub-Committee agreed that some changeswore desirable in Section G dealing with dividends.     I am thereforeattaching a rcvisod version of this section which I propose should boinserted in place of the soction in the printed proofs.     Tho changes are matters of drafting and presentation rather than substance.B.A.C.Department of Employment and Productivity, S.W.15th Docomber, 136$-2-

A. introduction. The challenge facing successive Governments since the war has been to find ways of pursuing a policy of steady and sustained growth. Successdepended on a new approach which would find ways of breaking the hithertoautomatic link between expansion and inflation which had led to balanceof payments crises and had forced Governments to check growth. It was fromthis belief that the productivity, prices and incomes policy was born, when inDecember 1964 Government, employers and trade unions in this countrysigned a Joint Statement of Intent which embodied a new approach to theproblems of Britain&apos;s economic development.2. Since that time the policy has played an important part in the Govern-ment&apos;s two-pronged strategy of correcting the grave deficits in our balance ofpayments while laying the foundations of sustained long-term growth. Duringthis period the operation of the policy has taken different forms as the natureof the economic challenge facing us has changed and, inevitably, heavy strainshave been put on it as priority has had to be given to resolving the immediateshort-term problems of our overseas deficits.3. But the principles which inspired the policy remain as valid as theyever were. Indeed, Britain is not alone in struggling to find ways of stimulatingexpansion without over-stimulating demand and so inflating costs. It is a problem which increasingly plagues all industrial economies, and othercountries are seeking a solution as earnestly as Britain is. But for this country,with its special dependence on international trade, the need to find a solution is imperative. The Government believes that a productivity, prices and incomes policy must continue to play a key role in any expansionist andsocially just economic strategy for Britain. It believes, too, that despite thedifficulties experienced in recent stages of the policy, neither employers norunions would wish to return to an irresponsible free for all, either in pricefixing or in wage bargaining.4. The purpose of this White Paper is to describe the framework withinwhich the Government believes the policy should develop. Improvements inour economic position have made it possible to remove the more stringentcontrols of the 1967 and 1968 Prices and Incomes Acts. But until our economic recovery is more firmly established, relaxation of our guard would be foolish.5. That is why the Government has decided to continue in force its powers under Part II of the 1966 Act. But the White Paper also provides the basis onwhich a long term policy, built on the voluntary acceptance of its aims asvisualised in the Joint Statement of 1964, can be developed in the years ahead.

B. REVIEW OF THE OPERATION OF THE policy. Any productivity, prices and incomes policy depends for its success onchanging peopled attitudes. The architects of the policy in 1965 saw it as anevolutionary process which could only yield results over a considerable periodof time. But for Britain in 1965 time for slow change was not available. In thedeliberately stimulated consumer boom period up to October 1964 everyonehad been encouraged to take rising living standards for granted regardlessas to whether they had been earned by higher productivity and exports.The Government was unable to bring home to people urgently enough thefact that it was this artificial boom which had precipitated in 1964 the highestoverseas deficit since the war. In 1965 and the first part of 1966 wage ratescontinued to increase at about 7-]-% a year while productivity was rising byabout \\a/0 a year. In July 1966, the Government decided to introduce aspart of a package of measures to deal with the balance of payments situationa prices and incomes standstill for six months, followed by a period of severe restraint until July 1967. But after this period there was a sharp increase in earnings, which rose at an annual rate of 9%.7. In November 1967, the   sterling was devalued and this had two results:first, it offered a great opportunity to effect a fundamental and lasting improve-ment in our competitive position, provided that our competitiveness was notonce again eroded by rising costs; and secondly, it increased the cost of our imports and led inevitably to an increase in prices generally. As the national board for Prices and Incomes put it in its Third General Report (Cmnd. 3715):&quot;We are thus faced with the paradoxical position that the act of devaluationmakes a prices and incomes policy more necessary than before while alsomaking its execution more difficult&quot;. Once again it became necessary to give an urgent short-term role to prices and incomes policy. The stringent powersof the 1968 Act over both prices and pay were needed to drive home the factthat Britain simply could not afford to throw away the advantages of devaluation by allowing a vicious price/wage spiral to force up unit costs.In this the policy was remarkably successful as the following table illustratingmovements in pay and prices in the main phases of the policy shows:Increases (at annual rates)Period	Hourly	Earnings		Wages, Salaries	Wage	(seasonally	Retail	per unit of	Rates	adjusted)	Prices	outputApril 1965-June 1966	7-4	7-6	51	7-0July 1966-June 1967	2-8	1-7	2-5	0-3July 1967-March 1968   ..	9-2	8-8	2-8	4-3April 1968-December 1968	4-5	7-9	5-5	1-9January 1969-September 1969	4-3	6-6	51	not availableNotes(a) The percentage increases quoted are those from the average for the quarter precedingeach period to the average for the final quarter of the period. Quarterly figures have been used which eliminate random fluctuations in the monthly figures.(b) Hourly wage rate figures are taken from the DEP&apos;s index of basic hourly wage rates andrelate to manual workers. Earnings figures are taken from the DEP&apos;s monthly index of weekly average wage and salary earnings. They relate to all industries and services andare seasonally adjusted.
8. In 1968-69 pay agreements were, by and large, kept within the guide-lines of the 1968 policy. The index of wage rates after March 1968 rose morethan the 3^% ceiling, but this was mainly due to productivity agreementsinvolving larger increases which were permissible under the policy. earnings in 1968 rose much faster, but then so did productivity, helped by rising output.One of the main aims of the policy during this period was to stimulate a new approach to productivity bargaining and its success in doing this undoubtedlycontributed to the exceptional increase in productivity which took place in1968 and which held down unit costs. At the same time industry co-operatedwillingly over prices policy, and the Government maintained a vigilantexamination of major price increases. As a result of all this by the end of 1968prices had risen only moderately over and above the 4j% increase whichflowed inevitably from the effect of devaluation on import prices and the increases in taxation needed to make devaluation work. In a period, therefore,when rising prices and expanding industrial activity might well have led to anuncontrollable spiral of pay and price increases, the rise in unit costs betweenMarch and December 1968 was successfully contained to an annual rate of9. It is too early to say what the rise in unit costs has been in 1969; but from the third quarter of 1969, pay settlements have once again begun to breakthrough the restraints of the policy. Settlements reached in September 1969averaged over 6%; in October they averaged about 84-%; largely due to increases paid to some groups in the public sector which matched increases in earnings achieved in private industry where local pay arrangements hadinflated earnings. It is against this background that future developments ofthe policy must be reviewed.10. The lesson of the past few years is that the use of a productivity, prices and incomes policy for short-term purposes can only have a short-term effect.The long-term role of the policy is essentially an educational one: designed tobring home the fact that continuing steady expansion of the economy depends on our striking the right balance between an immediate increase in consump-tion and the long-term needs of economic development. In doing so, it widensthe area of democratic choice. On the one hand we can choose to plan the risein incomes so that it does not endanger exports and the investment on whichproductivity, high real earnings and a high level of employment depend.On the other, we can claim the right to extort whatever increases in incomeswe can get individually regardless of the consequences and thus force govern-ments to control excess demand by slowing down the economy once again.In moving towards the long-term development of the policy the Governmentwill be placing more reliance on its educational role but the need to learn the lessons of economic choice is as urgent as ever it was. Old institutions and longestablished attitudes need to be changed. And all those who exercise marketpower in the economy, whether in the fields of goods, services or labour, need to be accountable for their actions to the community at large.
C. THE AIMS OF THE POLICYII. From the beginning, the policy has tried to give the community anopportunity of achieving three aims: to keep prices more stable than in the past;to achieve faster growth in the real standard of living;to gel a more rational and fair relationship between the incomes of variousgroups, and in particular to improve the position of low paid workers.12. Slopping prices rising as much as in the past means relating increases in money incomes to the rise in output. But it also means seeing that producers of goods and services do not exploit their market power at the expense of other sections of the community.13. Raising the real standard of living of the country means more capital investment in industry and more rapid adoption of new techniques. But it alsomeans making much more effective use of the time workers spend on the job,and persuading them to accept links between increases in their pay and in-crcascs in their productivity.14. To secure a fairer distribution of incomes means that some of us must accept a little smaller increase in our incomes over the years in order that thosewho are worse off can have more. There is no magic fund out of which we canimprove the position of low paid workers.15. In all these aims, the community has a choice which the government cannot make for it. If we want price stability, then we cannot all have large increases in pay every year regardless of Ihe rise in productivity. If we want ourreal standard of living to rise, we must be prepared lo change the way in which work is organised and carried out. If we want to improve the position of thosewho are worse off, the rest of us must he prepared lo accept a little less our-selves.16. The Green Paper &quot;The Task Ahead&quot; suggested thai Ihe rise in output per worker over the next few years would he of Ihe order of 3% a year. In 1968,there was a particularly large increase in output per worker. But this does notappear to have been repealed in 1969; and il would be most imprudent, andtotally at variance with past experience, to base policy on the hope that therewill be an early change in the rate of increase of output per worker. So ifincomes rise by an average of more than about 3%, a year, Ihe result will inevitably be a rise in prices caused by higher labour costs.17. Over Ihe pasl decade, incomes have in fact risen by much more than 3%a year. The average increase in earnings has been 6 or 6J % a year. The simpleand inevitable result of this has been a rise in prices year by year averagingsomething like 3%. Everyone objects lo rising prices. The lowest paid workers and those on small fixed incomes suffer most from them. Yet the country as awhole has not been prepared to accept that stable prices are simply incom-paliblc with large increases year by year in incomes which have not been earnedby higher productivity.18. Moreover, the evils flowing from a rise in money incomes faster thanthe rise in output are not confined to a rise in prices. It reduces the incentive to save. Our export position deteriorates and this requires deflationary measuresto put the balance of payments right.19. The Government believes that what the community as a whole reallywants is a steady rise in real incomes coupled with a broad measure of price
stability. This is what the policy aims at giving the community a chance to achieve over the next few years. Whether it succeeds depends not just on whatthe Government does, but on what choices individual men and women make.People can have large increases in pay but with inflation which takes awaymuch of the benefit. Or they, can have smaller money increases whose real value is greater because prices are kept stable and steady expansion is possible.In this sense any incomes policy is essentially a voluntary policy operatingthrough the decisions of employers and trade unions.20. None of these aims can be achieved by a prices and incomes policynarrowly conceived or operated in isolation from the other measures theGovernment is taking to strengthen the economy, increase industrial efficiency,improve the structure of the labour market and create a just society. but within this wider strategy, a prices and incomes policy is essential to achieve the following aims: establishing on a firm and continuing basis the principle of links between pay increases and the more effective use of labour;securing fundamental improvements in the methods of pay negolia-tion and settlement;creating wage and salary structures which will avoid successive leap-frogging settlements and eliminate friction;improving the position of low paid workers, particularly by re-organisations which will make better use of their efforts, and by theintroduction of equal pay for women;raising the efficiency with which labour and capital equipment are used in all sectors of the economy private industry, publicly ownedindustry, and the public services;ensuring that the larger industrial units now being brought into cx-istence use their resources efficiently and to the benefit of the con-sumer, and do not use their increased market power to operatepricing policies or pay policies which fail to lake proper account ofthe wider public interest.
I). FRAMEWORK OF THE POLICY21. Any productivity prices and incomes policy needs a framework withinwhich those concerned with the determination of pay or prices can work inorder to achieve the aims of the policy. There are three essential elements insuch a framework:guidance on t ho principles of the policy;notification of proposed pay settlements and price increases to theGovernment so that discussion can take place as to whether llicyconform to those principles;reference, where necessary, of individual cases to an independentauthority so thai il can examine in depth whether they arc consistent with the policy, and can advise on how Ihe principles of the policycan be applied more effectively.Guidance on the principles of the policy is set out in Section E of this white paper in relation to incomes and in Section F in relation to prices and charges.This guidance is inevitably in general terms: but il is intended to be appliedto their individual circumstances by all those concerned with settling rcmuncra-tion or with fixing prices and charges, including arbitrators, statutory wage and price fixing bodies and independent review bodies.The role of (he National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBP1)22. One of the outstanding achievements of Ihe policy since its inceptionhas been the part played by Ihe NBPI in influencing Ihc conduct ol collective bargaining, stimulating interest in Ihe more cllcclive use of labour and scrulin-ising the case for price increases. The lirsl duty of the Board, on receiving a reference, has been to ascertain and publish the facts; and Ihe 130 or so reports which il lias produced since it was sol up have buill up a valuable body ofinformation on Ihe factors making for inflationary pay settlements and un-justifiablc price levels. During the more stringent phases of the policy Ihemain task of the Board has been lo advise whether or nol (be individual pay settlements or price increases referred to il were in line with proposals forpolicy set out in the While Paper current at the time; and since Augtisl 1967the Government has only been able lo use its full standstill powers where an adverse report has been made by the Board. But in forming a view on Ihcsecases the Board has always sought to take a positive rather than a negative line,making constructive proposals as to how proposed pay settlements might bebrought into conformity with Ihe policy or how a proposed price increasemight be avoided by absorbing costs. In its first Report (Cmnd. 2695) theBoard said that il saw itself as &quot;promoting change by conducting a continuingdialogue with  managements, unions and indeed Government&quot;. Il has acled inthis spirit.In its first Report (Cmnd. 2695) the Board said that it saw itself as &quot;promotingchange by conducting a continuing dialogue with  managements, unions and indeed Government&quot;. It has acted in this spirit.23. Some of the most valuable work of the Board has been done throughwider studies of such general subjects as payment by results and job evaluation.The Government has also desired to emphasise the Board&apos;s constructive roleby using il to examine pay structures in a particular industry in order to try and influence subsequent negotiations, or lo examine the relationship between
costs and prices before a price increase was urgently sought. In such cases it ispossible to allow the Board more time for a study in depth than the threemonths normally available when a specific pay or price increase has to beconsidered.24. As its work has developed the Board has increasingly stressed that the effective examination of specific pay or price increases inevitably leads onto the consideration of wider questions about the operation of a firm or industry: how, for instance, it is tackling the problem of labour costs, whetherit is making full use of capital equipment, whether it is investing adequatelyand whether its pricing policies generally are in the public interest. Thesewider issues touch at many points the functions of the Monopolies Commissionin considering whether monopolies or oligopolies operate in ways contraryto the public interest, and the work of the two bodies has tended increasingly tooverlap. It is for this reason that the Government has decided to establish anew body to be called the Commission for Industry and Manpower (C1M) tobring together and develop the work at present carried out by the Mono-monopolies Commission and the NBPI, and legislation to achieve this will be presented in the current session of Parliament.25. The Government will continue to refer to the NBPI, and in due course,to the CIM, proposals for increases in prices and claims for increases in payor pay settlements notified under the early warning arrangements wheneverthese appear to require detailed examination. The Board-and the Commis-sion will be required as at present to examine them in the light of the guidanceset out in the White Paper. But the study in depth of wider issues of generalimportance to the development of the policy in the public sector as well as private industry will continue to be an important part of their activities.26. In September 1967 the Government decided that all major price in-creases proposed by the nationalised industries would be referred to the NBPI.The Government has now had the benefit of the Board&apos;s advice in a numberof these cases, and will continue to seek that advice where, on the merits of aparticular case, it considers it would be helpful. In the case of the nationalised industries, as in the case of the private sector, there will be occasions when theBoard can report most constructively on the basis of an examination of the relationship between costs and prices before a price increase is urgently sought.The Board&apos;s work in this field will be continued by the CIM.27. The Board has already carried out a wide ranging efficiency study ofone nationalised industry and has undertaken smaller scale studies in others.It is now beginning work on a new major study. The Government believes thatwell conducted studies of efficiency, undertaken at appropriate intervals,can make a contribution to management in the nationalised industries andto the work of Ministers responsible for policy in this field. It considers thatthe CIM like the Board will in appropriate cases have a role to play.Continuation in force of Part II of the 1966 Act28. The Government has always recognised that the full range of powersavailable under the 1967 and 1968 Prices and Incomes Acts to delay the implementation of pay and price increases was called for only in exceptional circumstances and as a short term measure. The delaying powers under the
1967 and 1968 Acts expire at the end of 1969 and will not be renewed. TheGovernment has however laid before Parliament a draft of the necessary order in Council continuing Part II of the 1966 Act in force for a year begin-ning on 1 January 1970.29. The purpose of the powers now being sought is twofold. In the firstplace they will enable the Government to require early warning of proposedpay and price increases. Such notification is essential to the operation of anyprices and incomes policy, as the Trades Union Congress has shown in askingits affiliated unions to inform the General Council of impending pay claims.The Government welcomes the steps which the TUC is taking to examine suchclaims and to invite the union or unions concerned to discuss them in the lightof its own criteria, but it believes it is also necessary for the offers made andthe settlements reached in response to claims to be considered in the light ofthe guidance given in this White Paper.30. It is equally important that proposals lo increase the prices of goods or services of particular economic significance or importance to the cost of livingshould be notified to the appropriate Government department so that they canbe scrutinised. In many cases this examination has been enough to producemodifications. Between March 1968 and November 1969, for example, about18% of the price increases notified were modified or withdrawn after dis-cussion with government departments.31. The early warning system has always operated on a voluntary basis.The Government is grateful for the co-operation of industry and hopes thatthe voluntary basis can continue without the use of its reserve powers. Asummary of the present arrangements for notifying pay claims and proposedpay and price increases is given in Appendices 1 and 2.32. Examination of proposals by Government departments may reveal theneed for deeper scrutiny by the NBP1. The second purpose of the Part IIpowers is to enable the Government to delay the implementation of a proposed increase of pay or prices for up to three months pending the Board&apos;s enquiry and report. In this way the Board will be given a chance to examine whetherthe proposals are consistent with the principles of the policy and there will bean opportunity to try to secure any necessary modifications before the pro-posals are implemented.33. The Government hopes that it will not be necessary to perpetuate thesedelaying powers in the legislation to set up the CIM. However the Govcrn-ment believes that such powers are essential if the vital role of the NBPI is tobe maintained in the coming months. The functions of the new Commissionand the powers that will be necessary to enable it to discharge them effectively,are to be discussed with both sides of industry.
E. GUIDANCE FOR PAY NEGOTIATIONSGeneral Character of Pay Settlements34. To keep prices as stable as possible has been an objective of the policy since the Joint Statement of Intent was signed by representatives of employers,unions, and the Government in December 1964. The cost of living can beaffected by a number of factors including the level of import prices and ofindirect taxation. During 1968 prices were unavoidably inflated by the effects of devaluation and the measures necessary to make it work. But price risesdue to these influences are now levelling out and the main determinant of price levels in the coming months will be how far we are successful in relatingincreases in money incomes to increases in output.35. In the next few years output per worker is likely to go up by about 3%a year. Therefore if we are to avoid a steep increase in the cost of living,money incomes should only rise at about this rate. This was the basis of the&quot;norm&quot; of 3-3 % for pay increases which formed the starting point of thepolicy in 1965. If productivity rises faster than expected then so can incomes.The principle was accepted in 1965. It is still true today.36. This means that most wage and salary settlements need to fall in the range of 2^-4^ % increase in a year. A range within which most settlementsneed to fall has been given because no single figure can be appropriate to thecircumstances of all negotiations. Nor indeed will the average figure be thesame from one year to the next. The appropriate level for a particular settle-ment within this range will depend on a variety of factors affecting the firm or industry, including the rate of increase in labour productivity, the extent towhich low paid or women workers are involved and the labour marketsituation. Opportunities must be given for changes in the relative pay ofdifferent groups of workers.37. Special care must be taken where basic rates are negotiated at thenational level but a substantial part of total earnings springs from payments of various kinds fixed by individual employers. If these local elements tend torise faster than the basic rates as they do in some industries then increases in the national basic rates need to be kept at a lower level than in settlementswhich effectively determine the real level of earnings. In the former cases anational settlement needs to be in the lower part of the range or indeedbelow it if it is not to be inflationary. This principle is recognised by the tuc in its own guidance to unions on pay claims contained in their 1969Economic Review.38. Some settlements&apos; in any year will exceptionally lie above the top of thenormal range if the other objectives of incomes policy are to be achieved en-ecouraging a more rapid rise in productivity and securing a better relation-ship between the pay of various groups of workers. But such settlements need to be exceptional, not normal, if there is to be reasonable price stability.39. In the following parts of this section, the main factors which come under consideration in individual pay negotiations are reviewed. In most cases what needs to be considered is their bearing on the point within the range of 2-]-4^% at which a settlement should fall. This section also reviews the exceptional circumstances in which it might be appropriate for a settlement to be concluded for a group of workers at a level outside the normal range.
40. Tho factors considered are:Productivity and lJtliciency AgreementsReorganisation of Pay Structures1 o\v Paid Workersliqual Pay for WomenLabour Market RequirementsPay in the Public Services41: The various reasons which may exist for increasing pay should beconsidered together. For example, there is no logic in arguing (hat an increasein pay of x&quot;,, is needed in order lo recruit an adequate Inborn force, and then in addition paying ail extra y&quot;,, as die workers&apos; share of a productivity deal.The y &quot;,, increase may well in itself raise pay sufficiently to recruit the necessary labour. All increases in pay, in any industry or linn, including those within Iherange, should, as far as possible, be covered by an increase in output pei workciin that industry or linn.Productivity and Kllicicncy Agreements42. A central feature ol Ihe productivity, prices and incomes policythroughout its development has been to encourage management and workerstogether to find ways of increasing productivity, anil lo relate pay lo perlormance. And under Ihe stimulus of Ihe policy, productivity bargaining has inthe past lour years spread widely through industry. Over 6 million workers have been involved in over 3,500 productivity agreements.43. The rapid spread of productivity bargaining has not occurred without raising some doubts and indeed criticism. Some have fell that productivitydeals represented little more than Ihe sale ol restrictive practices (&quot;selling Iheinlc-book&quot;) which should never have been allowed lo develop. This is loonarrow a view of inosi productivity agreements. Itui more fundamentalcriticisms were also made.44. Productivity agreements usually provided for changes in wmkingpractices to be aeeepted by the workers concerned in relurn lor higher pay.But what then of Ihe position of workers who hail never placed any restrictionson changes in working practice, and readily accepted the role ol managementlo organise work in the most elfeclive way? Would nol Ihe I rend lo productivitybargaining encourage, such workers in future in demand a price for theiracquiescence in change?45. Other critics argued thai Ihe real scope for productivity bargainingwas relatively narrow; thai many productivity agreements would have littleetfeel in raising output per worker; thai some agreements were &quot;phoney&quot;,designed simply to comply with Ihe form of incomes policy and not itssubstance; that there were some workers for whom il was inappropriateto specify changes in working practice; and that increases in one firm led to claims from those doing similar work in other firms with no similar justification.4h. Thirdly, concern was growing al Ihe possible repercussions olproductivity agreements covering particular groups of workers rather than all workers in a firm or industry. Specially large increases might be earned by aparticular group in return for a change in working practices. Hut llus leadedto lead in due course lo consequential increases to oilier workers in theestablishment (supervisors, maintenance workers, ollice stall) in order lo
maintain what was regarded as a sound pay structure. Moreover, speciallylarge increases in one year might raise expectations of similar increases in later years, when no similar increases in productivity would be possible.47. In these circumstances, the Government decided it would he helpful ifthe NBPI carried out a fresh review of the situation. The following conclusionsemerge from the Board&apos;s Report No. 123, &quot;Productivity Ameements&quot;(Cmnd. 4136) of August 1969:(i) productivity agreements have on the whole promoted good industrial relations;(ii) productivity bargaining has reduced costs: its clfect was thatproductivity rose more than earnings;(iii) productivity agreements should not be once-for-all a Hairs: ncgotia-tions linking pay and productivity are a continuing possibility:efficiency should be constantly raised on the basis of close and continuing co-operation between managements and workers;(iv) non-manual workers can contribute as effectively as manual workers to a more economical use of all the factors of production: and formsof agreement are needed which can be used for their particular circumstances.48. The NBPI concluded that the kind of points raised in paragraphs43-46above required that its earlier guide-lines for effective productivity agreements should be revised and broadened. In particular the Board wished to formulatethem in terms clearly applicable to all types of workers, both manual and non-manual, including those workers for whom it is not appropriate to specifychanges in working practices. The revised guide-lines for efficiency agreements,including productivity agreements, are set out in Appendix 3.49. In some industries cllicicncy agreements arc made more difficult for individual firms to conclude because the terms of national agreements and theprocess of collective bargaining itself take forms more appropriate to the days when the aim was to reach all the important decisions about pay at industrylevel. In these industries both sides need to look again at their arrangements.Sometimes it would be right to concentrate nationally on setting adequateminimum standards and providing a proper framework within which elliciencyagreements can be concluded at company level. Guidance from the centre,both by employers&apos; associations and by trade unions, can greatly help efficiencybargaining to develop on sound lines.50. In the next phase of the policy pay increases should wherever prac-ticable be negotiated in the context of an efficiency agreement which should aim at increasing the efficiency with which use is made of the capital equipment and labour in the undertaking. The principles set out in Appendix 3 arc clearlyapplicable to most workers: maintenance workers as well as productionworkers: ollice staff as well as factory workers: supervisory and professionalstaff as much as any other workers: workers in the public sector as well asthose in private industry and commerce. This overcomes the difficultypreviously experienced in applying a more narrowly conceived &quot;productivitybargaining&quot; in respect of many groups of workers.51. More thorough costing and monitoring of agreements is needed in manycases. The NBPI in its report drew attention to the shortcomings of manyfirms in this respect. Full account must be taken of possible consequential pay
increases to oilier workers in the establishment, and Cull allowance made loran adequate return on extra capilal employed.52. Consumers must share in the benefits of higher productivity throughstable or lower prices if all sections of the community arc lo share in risingnational prosperity. In most cases rising productivity docs not spring entirely from major changes in working practice or working methods. In sonic partsof the economy modern technology enables output per worker lo be increasedspecially rapidly and without extra effort. In these cases particularly il wouldbe quite wrong for all I lie benefits of increased productivity lo be enjoyed by workers and shareholders in the enterprise. So a reasonable share must beused for (he benefit of the community as a whole.53 Incomes policy has always accepted thai workers who have contributed by their efforts to a rise in productivity are entitled lo share in its benefitsthrough higher pay. In some cases a reasonable share for Ihe workers con-eerned may permit a pay increase higher than Ihe normal range for settlements.But in many cases the rise in productivity will be no more than sullicicnl loenable pay increases within the normal range to be made. Increases in productivity should not in any case be treated as an isolated element in pay settlements divorced from other grounds for raising pay.Reorganisation of l&apos;ay Structures54. The efficient use of labour and other resources can be made impossibleby out of date even chaotic pay structures which have grown up over years,even decades, and which bear little relation to the realities of present dayworking methods. Where such a slate ol affairs lias developed there may be no alternative lo a thorough-going rationalisation of the whole grading, and pay structure and of the distribution of duties amongst Ihe workers.55. Such a fundamental reorganisation may well involve increases in pay which, on average, work out above the normal range. This may be justifiedboth for the employer and for tlie community al large if it opens the wayto substantial improvements in I lie efficiency willi which labour is used. Amore rational pay structure based on job evaluation may also reduce Ihe risks of leap-frogging pay claims amongst Ihe various groups of workers, andeliminate causes of dissatisfaction among workers. The NBIM has produced a valuable report on Job Evaluation (Cnind. 3772) and some of the main pointsfrom this report are given in Appendix 4.56. The full gains from such a reorganisation will however only be realised in the long term. This makes il particularly important to associate a funda-menlal reorganisation of pay structure with  the conclusion of an elliciencyagreement through which the gains expected from the reorganisation are achieved.57. Of course all pay systems and structures need lo be kepi in line willichanges in the methods of work and systems of organisation. But this shouldbe a continuous process, and there should he no need for exceptionally largepay increases to be given in connection with such limited changes. Majorreorganisations should become necessary only infrequently perhaps once ina decade.58. Major reorganisations of pay structure have been carried through inmany firms and industries in the past live years, lint others also require major
changes. Some have already been examined by the NBPI, or in other ways.The Government accepts the responsibility for carrying through changes whichbecome necessary in the public services with which it is concerned. It will giveall the help it can to those trying to achieve reforms in other sectors of the economy.Low Paid Workers59. One of the weaknesses of the system of free collective bargaining hasbeen its inability to solve the problem of the low paid. Many of them are poorlyorganised, and even where they arc well organised they do not commandeconomic power. That is one of the reasons why they are badly paid. Under asystem where wage increases go to the strong, the low paid have difficulty in holding their own, let alone improving their position.60. One of the main aims of any productivity, prices and incomes policy must be to remedy this failure of a free-for-all system. Since 1965 the policy has offered opportunities for improving the relative position of the low paid.(For instance, under the criteria laid down in the policy for 1968-69, low paywas held to be sufficient justification for increases up to the ceiling and indeedabove the ceiling if other workers in the group were willing to let the low paidhave priority). But the decision to give such priority was left to the employersand unions concerned; and although the gap between low paid and higher paid industries narrowed slightly it was not greatly reduced.61. The challenge which faces us as a socially just society is what steps wecan now take to improve the lot of the low paid in an increasingly affluentsociety. This will call for a conscious, deliberate effort by all those involved Government, employers and trade unions. The first step must be to identifywho arc the low paid and why they are low paid. The initiative taken by theDepartment of Employment and Productivity in launching a new EarningsSurvey in September 1968 covering all industries and occupations now enablesus to discover the exact distribution of earnings behind the averages, byoccupation, age and region, and thus to locate the lower paid groups. It hasalso sought lo identify some reasons for low pay: whether for example it is associated with any particular age level, with payments in kind or with mentalor physical disability.62. The survey shows that in October 1968 1 in every 12 adult maleworkers in this country had total earnings before lax for a full week of less than 15, and nearly I in 30 less than  13 a week, at a time when the average adultmale worker earned more than  25. The position of women was much worse;one in every 4 adult women had earnings for a full week of  10 a week or less,and nearly 1 in 12 less than  8 a week. The Survey shows that certain industries had a particularly large proportion of workers below these levels (farming,catering, and retail distribution are obvious examples). But detailed analysisreveals that the great majority of low paid workers are scattered throughoutindustries whose workers, taken as a whole, are well paid. It shows too, thatthe reasons for low pay vary from group lo group, almost from individual to individual. In some cases the reasons for their low pay would be difficult to overcome. For example, some people are low paid because they are young andinexperienced; others because they have passed their productive peak. Someworkers prefer low paid jobs because they arc less exacting and more suited totheir abilities, and therefore oiler them their best hope of having a job. Earnings
arc also a fleeted in some cases by the number of hours worked or by theexistence ol&quot; lips or payments in kind. All this means that no single figure canrepresent a general definition of &quot;low pay&quot; applicable to workers in all circumstances-stances. And the problem is in many cases too complex to be met by blanketincreases covering a whole industry, or even a whole occupation.63. In recent years it has been suggested that the inequalities of a systemof free collective bargaining could be redressed by introducing a statutorynational minimum wage or minimum earnings level. The Government setup an inter-departmental working party lo study the implications of a national minimum wage and its report * was published for the purpose of providing afactual basis for informed discussions which the Government now hopes willtake place. The study shows the complexity of the problem of helping Ihe lowincome groups. For instance about two-thirds of the households in the country with an income of less than  15 a week would not benefit from a national minimum wage as they do not contain any wage earners. Again, a national minimum wage would have a very uneven effect  in relieving poverty because it could not take account of family circumstances. The question of low paycannot therefore be separated from social service policy. But an even greater difficulty arises from the fact that by far the greater number of low paid workers are scattered through industries where Ihe general level of pay is relatively high. If, therefore, other wage earners in these industries merely lookIhe establishment of a national minimum as a new base on which to rebuildtheir existing differentials, the cosl of living would rise sharply; and the low paid would in the end be no betlcr off. Unfortunately Ihere is at present little evidence that higher paid workers would not take advantage for their own purposes of the attempt to help the low paid through the establishment bylaw of a national minimum.64. I low, then, can the problem ol&apos; low pay be tackled? The first need is tostrengthen trade union organisation among these low paid groups and thiswill be one of the aims of the Industrial Relations Bill. Many of Ihe occupationswhere low pay predominates are al present covered by Wages Councils andil is arguable that this protection, which was once essential, is actually ahindrance today lo the development of effective voluntary collective bar-gaining. The Industrial Relations Bill will make it easier to dismantle IheWages Council machinery in (hose industries where this has become desirable in Ihe workers&apos; interests.65. Secondly, many groups of workers arc low paid simply because theirproductivity is low. Much could be done by employers, with the co-operationol&apos; unions, to change working methods and so help the low paid lo achievehigher earnings by sharply raising their productivity. 11 ere again the Ciovcrn-mcnt has given a lead by Ihe emphasis it has laid on the productivity aspects ofthe policy. The NBPI has spell out the possibilities for improving Ihe earningspotential of low paid workers in such activities as clothing manufacture,local government and the National Health Service. In some cases good pro-gross has been made in applying the Boarcfs suggestions; in others manage-mentally still seems unaware of, or indilfcrcnt to, the new techniques required.One of the tasks of the recently created Manpower and Productivity Serviceof Ihe DEP has been lo help management and unions to follow up the possi-* National Minimum W;ifjL-. Report ol an lnler-Dcp;iilmenl;il Working Piirly. IIMSO 1969.
bilities opened up by the Board&apos;s reports. The Government intends that theMPS shall play an increasingly active role in seeing that the proposals of theBoard (and later the CIM) for improving the productivity and therfore the earnings of the low paid are followed up urgently.66. But when all this has been done the solution of this problem will stilldepend primarily on the attitude of negotiators in industry. The only hope ofthe low paid lies in a conscious decision by their fellow workers that theywill accept a reassessment of differentials both between different industries and within an industry. Some differentials are of course fully justified properlyreflecting additional responsibility or rewarding the acquisition of new skills.But this is by no means true in every case; and that is why the Governmenthas welcomed the increasing use of job evaluation, not only in manufacturing industry, but for such groups as local government manual workers and ancillary workers in the National Health Service in order to establish theworth of jobs on an objective basis. This can often lead to a reappraisal ofthe worth of jobs which are at present low paid.67. One way of helping many low paid workers is to give priority to theimprovement of minimum earnings levels as has been done in engineering,rubber manufacturing, food manufacturing and the motor vehicle retail and repairing trade. This enables much larger increases to be given to the low paid workers than to the rest of the workers in the industry.68. But neither job evaluation nor minimum earnings levels nor any othertechniques will succeed in improving the real position of low paid workersunless employers and unions wish to do so. There can be no lasting improve-ment in the position of the low paid, either relatively or in real terms, if everyincrease they win becomes a new &quot;floor&quot; on which the existing spread ofrates of pay is re-erected automatically, thus engendering not social justice butinflation. Recent wage claims by dustmen and firemen aroused a good deal ofpublic sympathy in the belief that the pay of these groups of essential workers had fallen behind those of workers in manufacturing industry. Yet oncesubstantial increases had been granted, others many of whom are on higherlevels of pay promptly began to argue that these settlements entitled themto similar increases. It is this attitude of mind which, if it continues, will stultifythe Governments efforts to improve the position of the low paid.69. What is needed is a real improvement in the position of those who arelow paid in the context of particular situations, of particular needs, and ofparticular systems of pay negotiations. To do this the Government&apos; intends to ask the NBPI (and later the CIM) to initiate investigations in depth intothose cases where low pay is a major problem and to suggest the means bywhich progress can be made ease by case, industry by industry.70. Where low paid workers form comparatively small pockets in more highly paid industries, it should be possible to improve their position as partof a pay settlement falling within the normal range. In a few industries,however, the general pay level is low; here any radical improvement in theposition of the low paid can only be achieved by a settlement above the nor-mal range, and the Government recognises that in these cases such a scttle-ment may be appropriate, particularly in association with measures to in-crease efficiency. That is why the Government accepted as justified in February
1969 a wage increase above the ceiling for farm workers. I lowever, the numbers involved in these generally low paid industries form a very small part ol&apos; thenational labour force; and increases above Ihe normal range in such industries should not mean an intolerable addition to the national wages bill providedI lull workers in oilier heller paid industries do not take this as o signal to stepup their own claims.71. The Government will be guided by the approach in this While Paper indealing with its own employees. But here loo the unions will have the re-sponsibility of deciding whether, and to what extent, they arc prepared loco-operate in giving priority to the low paid within settlements which on average fall within the normal range.72. The Government invites unions and employers to join with il in work-ing out, within the context of the policy outlined above, solutions to the pro.lvlems of those low paid workers who have been unjustifiably left behind in Ihescramble of wage bargaining. Only in this way can social justice be achieved without imperilling our economic recovery.Kqual Pay for Women73. As the National Minimum Wage report points out, women comprisethe great majority of low paid workers. Any policy designed to lift Ihe levels of low pay will therefore he concerned lo a very great extent with women.74. There are many reasons why women earn less than men. Differences in average earnings reflect such facts as thai women may be employed in lessskilled jobs or work little overtime. But women also earn less because their rates of pay, including Wages Council rales, arc commonly only four-fifths ofthe corresponding meifs rales, and because industries where very low pay isfound lend to have a relatively high proportion of women who are employedin small firms, and whom the trade unions find it very difficult to organise., 75. Il is for these reasons, as well as on grounds of natural justice, that theGovernment has decided lo legislate on equal pay. II has announced its inlon-tion to introduce legislation which would make discrimination in rcmuncra-tion on grounds of sex illegal by the end of 1975. The full implementation of equal pay means that there will be a statutory obligation to give many womensubstantial increases over the next six years to bring their rales up lo ihe levelof mcn&apos;s rates. In negotiations between now and 1975 there will therefore needlo be increases in many womcn&apos;s rales substantially greater than those inmcn&apos;s rales.76. Overall, the Government estimates that the introduction of equal paywill increase Ihe national wage and salary bill by between 3% and 4% be-tween now and Ihe end of 1975. This is not a large amount in comparison will)Ihe increase of perhaps 20% in output per head which is likely lo occur during that period. Overall il should be possible lo accommodate il without raisingsignificantly Ihe average yearly increase in money incomes throughout the economy. Indeed in many individual firms il should be possible to move lowards ecpial pay without taking pay settlements outside Ihe normal range.77. The cost of introducing equal pay will however be spread unevenlyover Ihe economy, and will fall particularly on linns employing a high proportion of women at rales well below those of men doing similar work   In
such cases the Government recognises that the introduction of equal pay willhe possible only through pay settlements which on average work out above(he normal range.78. As with low paid workers generally women workers are, in many cases,used less efficiently than they might be. Indeed low rates of pay have in Ihepast reduced the incentive to use womon&apos;s labour more productively. Surveysin many industries have revealed the opportunities for reorganising womcifswork so as to raise their productivity. And if these opportunities are taken this in itself will cover al least part of Ihe cost of introducing equal pay.7(). By definition moves towards equal pay for women cannot be used asarguments for increasing men\s rales of pay; nor should Ihey be used as argii-inents for increases in the pay of those women who already enjoy equality in rates. Equal pay for women is one move towards a fairer and more rationalstructure of pay. Like all such moves il involves changes in traditional paydifferentials. The community must accept these changes as a necessaryconsequence of accepting Ihe principle of equal pay.Labour Market Requirements80. Many pay increases are defended by employers on the grounds thatIhey are necessary to keep their pay in line with &quot;market rales&quot; and so enableIhem to retain their workers or recruit additional labour. These arguments arenot confined to situations where there is an immediate labour supply problem.Employers often argue that they need lo increase Ihe pay of their workers eitherlo match rates paid in oilier undertakings, or changes in rales or earningselsewhere, because otherwise labour supply difficulties would soon emerge.They argue thai il is both foolish, and unfair to their workers, lo wail untilthe situation deteriorates visibly. For their part, unions often place great weight in negotiations on changes in the pay of oilier groups of workers whohave had increases since (heir last settlement.81. Without doubt some weight must be given in pay negotiations lo Ihecflecls of pay on Ihe maintenance of an adequate labour force. Clearly for thispurpose some account must be taken of comparisons wiih Ihe pay of workersdoing similar jobs in Ihe same area, or with the pay for different jobs lo whichworkers could move. And in jobs requiring special skills or training pay has got to be kept at levels which will encourage an adequate rale of recruitmentin the long term.82. The question which needs to be asked in terms of incomes policy is how much weight should be attached to these factors, as compared with thelinking of pay lo performance, or with  producing a stable and equitable pay structure. In practice arguments based on so-called labour market require -mcnls and, therefore, on comparisons with the pay of others have oftenplayed and continue to play too large a role in pay negotiations; when Ihishappens they are an inflationary clement in pay settlements.83. In national negotiations immediate labour supply difficulties willrarely constitute a sound argument for an increase in pay above I lie normal range. The labour supply situation differs from one part of Ihe country loanother often from one firm to another. No single increase in pay is likelylo be apt for all. An individual employer may however lind himself unable lo
recruit enough labour to meet an expansion of his business; or may face anincrease in labour turnover, and in particular may find some of his bestworkers leaving for other jobs where they can get higher pay.84. However, simple comparisons with levels of pay in other firms or with changes in rates paid by other firms are usually so over-simplified as togive only poor guidance as to the case for a pay increase on labour supply grounds. As regards absolute levels of pay there is now ample evidence of thefact that quite large differences in earnings by the same type of worker be-twecn one firm and another in the same area can exist for long periods oftime without leading to a loss of labour by the firms with  lower pay. In suchcases Ihe difference probably reflect other factors making it preferable to workfor one employer rather than another. Many factors may influence an individ-ual workers choice of employer and job. A case for a pay increase on thegrounds that rates or earnings in a particular enterprise are below those of similar jobs in other enterprises demands (even il&quot; other conditions arc satisfied)a most careful analysis of all the facts about the conditions of employment, andthe job itself and actual earnings. Jobs which, on the face of il, appear to be thesame may be found under detailed examination lo have significant differences;or earnings may turn out to be much the same, although rates differ.85. Simple comparisons made with changes in pay in other jobs are alsounlikely in themselves to provide clear grounds for any particular increase.In the first place, all depends on the assumption that at some previous date Iherelationship with pay in the other jobs was appropriate; and there is seldommuch evidence of this. In the second place, comparisons are only too oftenwilh changes in some general index of wage rates or earnings and not with the changes in pay of jobs in the same area to which the workers concerned couldmove.86. In any ease, an effort lo deal with actual or impending labour supplydifficulties simply by increasing pay is seldom likely to be the solution.Employers need to consider with  their workers whether: an efficiency agreement (or a revision of an earlier one) would meetthe situation by both reducing the labour requirement and increasingthe rewards for the job;full advantage has been taken of all possible scope for internaltransfers, training and retraining of the existing work force;the causes of excessive overtime, absenteeism or labour turnoverhave been established and appropriate action taken;methods of attracting and recruiting labour are themselves adequate.87. Such measures are particularly important since straight increases in pay are often unlikely permanently to secure extra labour or to prevent a lossof labour. A labour shortage in a particular firm is often no more than areflection of a general shortage of that kind of labour in the area. In suchcases an increase in pay by one firm is likely simply to be copied by other firms;in the end the pay increases will not have helped significantly to meet the labour shortage concerned.88. All this means that too much weight must not be placed simply onkeeping rates of pay in line with those of other workers as a means of main-taining an adequate labour force. Nevertheless, it is one factor which employersneed to consider; and it may well affect the level of pay increase within the
normal range which is appropriate in a particular case. But to make pay in-crcascs above the normal range merely on labour supply grounds is something which needs very strong justification indeed. And it should only be contem-philed if, after taking account of the consideration mentioned in paragraphs86 and 87:-(i) detailed information is available about comparative pay and earningsfor clearly similar jobs; and(ii) the discrepancy revealed is so substantial that even with an increasein pay at the top of the normal range the employer is still likely to beleft with serious labour supply difficulties.89. Even when no special problems of labour supply exist, comparisons with the level of pay in similar occupations, or with average increases in pay of all workers, often assume a crucial role (cither implicit or explicit) in pay negotiations. This springs perhaps from a widespread, and no doubt natural,feeling that when the national wealth is increasing year by year the increase should be shared throughout the working population. No doubt it also springsfrom an equally widespread, if less admirable, feeling that each worker is entitled to have as large an increase as the next man or woman. If the general level of pay increases were no greater than the increase in national production,the use of comparisons as the basis for pay increases might not be positivelyharmful, although it would obstruct many desirable changes. But in presentcircumstances, general use of the &quot;comparability&quot; argument as a basis forpay increases is a recipe for inflation. This is particularly true of claims basedon: the mere maintenance of traditional relationships which have no economic justification;the restoration of differentials between higher and lower paid workers following an increase given deliberately to improve theposition of the lower paid;the restoration of pay relativities which have altered over the years asa result of changes in the social structure;the matching of pay increases earned by other workers underefficiency agreements.90. This is not to say that comparisons with changes in the pay of other workers are wholly irrelevant in considering pay. Supervisors need lo be paidmore than line workers, and craftsmen should normally earn more than un-skillcd workers in the same plant. Chaotic pay structures can only lead to future trouble. Moreover, in skilled occupations the question of future re-cruilmenl may be highly relevant.91. It is important that workers in an enterprise should feel they arc beingfairly treated. It is not enough to reduce the emphasis on comparability.Management must also create other opportunities for improving pay. and care must be taken to see that pay differentials are not changed so fast or sofar as to create serious difficulties in labour relations. All these matters mustbe considered in deciding on the appropriate size of pay increase within thenormal range for settlements.Pay in the Public Services92. Subject to what is said below, the guidance set out in this While Paper
applies to the settlement of pay in the public services as much as to thesettlement of pay in (lie private sector ami in the nationalised industries.The Governments continuing policy is thai workers in the public services should be treated on the same busts as those in other sectors of the economy.93. Sonic special problems always arise in settling pay in the public services. In the fust place, the nature of the jobs done by many workers in thepublic services (eg. teachers, doctors and nurses) makes it impracticable lomeasure their output lor ihe purpose of making a direct link betweenefficiency and pay. This docs not mean their efficiency cannol be raised but ilhas lo be done by other means. Secondly, though Ihe cost of labour can be measured as readily as elsewhere, a market price cannol normally be assignedlo Ihe value of its output because ihe output is no! sold in a competitive market,This removes one of the major factors which bear on pay in oilier sectors of the economy. Thirdly, movement in and oul of (he public services lends lo be restricted no! only by the career nature of much of the employment, bul also by the limited opportunities for employment elsewhere in (he same kind of jobfor some occupations in Ihe public services. This means lhal an unduly low level of pay in a public service, if il were allowed lo develop, might lake a relatively long time lo show itself in labour supply difficulties. Finally, sinceIhe Government is directly or indirectly involved in all pay settlements in Ihemost of public services, there arc strong pressures for broad uniformity oftreatment, in spile of Ihe large numbers and varied occupations involved.94. These problems mean lhal, for many public servants, more reliancehas to be placed in determining pay on llie closes! comparisons possible withIhe pay of workers doing similar jobs in Ihe private sector. In exceptional cases such as Ihe police, for whom (here are no counterparts in the private sector, close comparisons arc nol possible and, where Ihe method ol comparison has to be used, more generalised comparisons with  pay elsewhere are difficult lo avoid.95. In all cases where comparisons are used as a basis for determining pay and increased pay cannol be directly linked lo increased efficiency, Iheattainment ol higher levels of efficiency will continue lo be sought by oiliermeans. Indeed, (he more extensive use of comparisons in determining the pay of public servants imposes a unique responsibility on employers, unions and workers lo seek to maximise efficiency by every possible means preciselybecause there will be no direct pay incentive for so doing.96. The Government will continue its practice of asking llie N 111*1 and later Ihe CIM lo consider particular pay issues arising in the public services in relation lo Ihe guidance sel out in Ibis While Paper. Kill even more impor-tant, the Government intend lo use Ihe Hoard and ils successor to makeperiodic reviews of I he pay structures in various parts of the public servicesand, in particular, lo advise on ways in which changes in pay structures andIhe organisation of the work can increase (he efficiency of the service, concerned.Sonic General Considerations97. The guidance set out in I lie previous parts of this section has beenrelated primarily lo pay settlements. II is mainly concerned therefore withincreases in rales of pay, whether al llie national or local level, whclher of wageor salary earners, rather than with individual earnings, which will be affected
by the number of hours worked; by levels of output under payment by resultsschemes; by pay increments or merit awards within pay scales; by pay increases on promotion lo more responsible jobs. These factors, if under proper control,do not increase labour costs per unit of output.98. However, increases in rates of pay need to lake account of some other major factors affecting earnings. For example, a reduction in normal hours oran increase in the length of holidays must be treated on all fours with anincrease in rates of pay. Such changes will increase unit costs of productionjust as much as a pay increase.99. Although increases in rates of pay above the normal range representthe biggest inflationary risk, other elements in pay can easily be handled in aninflationary manner by employers, as enquiries by Ihe NBPI have repeatedlyshown. Overtime can be used simply as a way of raising earnings rather thanbecause it is essential. Payment by results schemes can easily get out of control;guidelines prepared by Ihe NBPI for assessing whether a payment by resultsscheme is working successfully or is in need of overhaul are set out in Appendix5. Posts may be upgraded or merit pay given as an alternative lo raising basic-rales. Some lypes of incremental scale may be found in practice to cost moreyear by year, creating a kind of &quot;salary drift&quot; corresponding lo &quot;wage drifl&quot;*.In such cases Ihe resultant increase in earnings can well be seriously inflationary.There is no virtue in an employer keeping a pay settlement within the normal range if increases in average earnings far exceed the range in these ways.100. Il is wholly undesirable for pay settlements It) be reached at intervalsshorter than twelve months. If one pay settlement follows another al an interval of less than a year it is impossible lo assess properly Ihe effects of theearlier one in achieving what il set out lo do. lime is needed lo assess Iheworking out of the cosls ami benefits of a productivity agreement or lo see whether a rise in pay has had the effect  expected on recruitment or labourturnover. Moreover, increases at short intervals for workers in one industry are disturbing lo those who work in other industries. In many cases, payagreements covering periods longer than twelve months would be appropriate.101. Where an agreement takes effect after an interval of more than a year from the last one, Ihe normal range can be adjusted proportionately lo lakeaccount of Ihe longer period, lint (here is no reason why a settlement whoseoperative dale is more than I 2 months after Ihe last one should, merely on this account, be above A\&quot;/,.* This possibility is discussed fully in I lie N llt&apos;1 Rcporl on &quot;Siiliny Si inclines&quot; (Cinnd. &apos;l 17H)

(;. GUIDANCE FOR DETERMINING DIVIDENDS114. From the outset of Ihe policy in 1964 (lie (ioveiiunenl has emphasisedits intention to use its fiscal powers or other appropriate means to correct anyexcessive growth in aggregate profits, whether distributed or not, as comparedwith the growth of total wages and salaries. Total company profits, as well asthe profits ol individual companies, fluctuate sharply from year lo year(usually increasing in periods of expansion of production) whereas totalwages and salaries increase each year. It is therefore Ihe trend in profits thatis relevant, rather than short-term fluctuations. In fact Ihe trend over Ihe past20 years has been for profits lo form a somewhat lower proportion of the totalgross domestic product. Since 1965 there has been, contrary to some sugges-tions, no increase in dividends on ordinary shares. Ihe figures arc given in the table below. This shows that in l%X less was paid out than in cither 1.965 or1966.Dividends on Ordinary Shares  million1965   .. 1,7351966 1,6871967   .. 1,576196S    .. 1,630Source: CSO.115. The 1968 Budget introduced a 31 &quot;,, ceiling on increases in individualcompany dividends as a necessary re-inforcemenl of this policy- It was a short-term measure associated with stringent control of other incomes and prices.116. A ceiling for dividends paid out by individual companies is undesirableas a long-term policy. A fixed ceiling can seriously distort Ihe ability of expanding linns lo raise adequate additional capital in Ihe market. Il mayexpose linns to take-over bids on terms which do not properly reflect Ihe valueof the undertaking to be acquired. Control of individual dividends blurs the distinction amongst investors between linns which are expanding their profitsthrough increased elliciency and linns which are not energetically improving their position. It does not encourage new investment lo go where il will yieldthe highest return, and so make Ihe greatest contribution lo higher national productivity.I 17. Moreover control of profits distributed by individual companies maynot in itself reduce the share of Ihe national product going lo the owners ofcapital; nor in Ihe long run Ihe amount of spendable income available Idindividual shareholders. For il profits are not distributed they are likely In beploughed back into Ihe business or invested outside; and either way Ihe gainsbelong lo Ihe shareholders and are likely in due course lo be reflected in llievalues ol Ihe shareholding over lime. Over a period oI years a restriction indistributed profits may do lillle more than replace current income by capital gains which arc taxed al a lower rale. For these reasons Ihe II &quot;,, ceiling schemefor dividends will come lo an end on 31 December 1969.118. Il will still continue lo be necessary for companies lo observe modernlion when distributing profits. The continuation in force of Part II of IhePrices and Incomes Act 1966 will mean that the Government will continuelo have the power lo require notification of individual dividend increases ifIbis seems desirable. The Government will also continue lo have Ihe power
to refer to the NBPI-and later to the CIM -eases where the growth of profits and dividends appear to be based on price levels made possible by excessivemarket power and will do so in appropriate eases. However since the dividendsof quoted companies are declared publicly the Government considers it unnecessary at the present time to ask for direct notification of declarations.
Rents119. Rent affects the household budget of millions of families. During1968 and 1969 the Government successfully prevented undue increases in rents.120. In the private sector, the great majority of unfurnished tenancies otherthan those which are still controlled arc subject to the rent regulation systemset up by the Rent Act 1965. In general the rent of such tenancies can beincreased only as the result of the determination of a fair rent by a rent olliceror rent assessment committee. In some cases Ihe rent will previously have beenlow, and the determination of Ihe new rent can involve sharp increases. UnderPart 111 of the Prices and incomes act 1968 Ihe Housing Ministers have ensuredthai such increases occurring during the hitler half of l%K and in 1969 willhave been spread out, or &quot;phased&quot;, in annual stages.121. Part 111 of this Act also required local authorities to obtain Iheconsent of the Housing Ministers to any increase in Ihe rents of council houses. Many local authorities followed the Governments advice andvoluntarily refrained from making avoidable rent increases. Hut in some casesIhe Housing Ministers had lo use their powers to prevent rent increases whichwere not justified by rising costs or which an authority could avoid by, lorexample, using housing account balances. In addition Ihe Government adopted the recommendation of the National Board for Prices and Incomes that Iherents of any Council should not be increased by more than 7s. 6cl. on averagein a 12-month period. Ministers have also been unwilling to authorise increases of more than l()s. a week for any individual house in any year.122. The powers in the 1968 Act governing rent increases expire at theend of 1969. The Government considers that restraint in rent increases must continue lo be an integral part of prices and incomes policy. Measures aretherefore being taken to continue the restriction of sharp rent increases for afurther period, and a Bill is before Parliament.123. For regulated tenancies, the Government has brought forwardlegislation under which phasing of rent increases is lo continue for two more years. This will apply lo rents registered up lo the end of 1971, and willcomplement the phasing arrangements already introduced under Ihe I lousingActs of&quot; 1969 for rent increases resulting from the conversion from rent control to rent regulation of houses in good repair, or from grant-aided improvements.124. As regards council rents, the Government believes that the principlesjustifying increases are now well established and understood, and should as faras possible be applied by the local authorities themselves. The HousingMinisters have accordingly agreed with Ihe local authority associations thairents would be increased only to meel unavoidable increases in costs on thebasis of guidelines which are being recommended lo their members forobservance during the period 1 January 1970 lo 30 June 1971.125. The legislation provides that any increase which in any 12-month period exceeds 7s. 6d. a week on average, or l()s. a week for any individualhouse, will require the prior consent of the appropriate Minister. This is unlikely to be given save in the most exceptional circumstances.126. Ministers will continue to ensure under the existing arrangements that restraint in rent increases is applied lo houses owned by New Towns andthe Scottish Special Housing Association.
Kates127. Rales, as a form ol&apos; taxation, are outside Ihe scope of prices amiincomes policy: they are necessary to help pay lor the range of services provided by local authorities. Belter services are bound lo cost more money.The (. iovcrnmen! has taken steps lo reduce the impact of rales on householdersby providing special grants which have reduced the amount m the   I hey haveto pay. In England and Wales the reduction has been 5d. in Ihe   in 1967/68,lOd. in Ihe i&apos; in 1968/69 and Is. 3d. in Ihe   this year; the reduction in 1970/71will be Is. 8d. in the  . As a result of this, and of the savings made by localauthorities, domestic rates were held steady, on average, in 1967/68 and1968/69, and went up by only -\\ &quot;,, in 1969/70. In addition the income limils forrate rebates were raised from October 1968 and this has helped many householders with small incomes, particularly those with large families. In Scotland,where rale poundages are higher than m England and Wales, special grantshave reduced Ihe amount which householders would otherwise have hadto pay by lOd. in thef in 1967/68, Is. 8d. in Ihet in l968/69niid 2s. 6d. in Ihe  this year. With this assistance, domestic rates increased on average by only 7d.in the   between 1966/67 and 1968/69. Il is not yet possible to say what Iheposition will he in 1969/70, because of Ihe later rating year in Scotland.
ARRANGEMENTS FOR NOTIFYING PAY claims and PROPOSED PAY INCREASESPrivate Sector1. The Trades Union Congress operates arrangements under whichaffiliated organisations are asked to inform the General Council of all impend-ing claims. The TUC keep the Department of Employment and Productivityinformed of developments in respect of affiliated unions.2. Unions and staff associations etc. not affiliated to the TUC notifyclaims direct to the DEP.3. The Confederation of British Industry operates arrangements to providethe Government with information about claims, formal offers, references to arbitration and terms of settlement reported to il by its members. So far as national claims and settlements are concerned, the CBI itself collects theinformation and passes it on to the DEP. Information about local and cdm-pany negotiations is supplied to the DEP direct by member firms and cm-plpycrs&apos; organisations.4. Employers&apos; organisations which arc not members of the CBI, and firms which are neither members of the CBI nor members of member employers&apos;organisations are expected to supply information about claims, formal offersand terms of settlement direct to the DEP.5. The information about claims and proposed settlements should specify:(i) the nature and terms of the claim,(ii) the proposed dale of implementation,(iii) the number and category of workers covered,(iv) the date and terms of the previous settlement covering this group of workers,and  (v) an assessment of the justification for the proposed improvementin the light of the guidance given in this White Paper.6. While the guidance given in this White Paper applies to all settlements,the information to be submitted under the early warning arrangementsrelates to claims and proposed settlements which might be significant (e.g.because of the nature of the claim, or the possible repercussions on the pay ofother groups) and, in any ease, lo all those involving more than 100 workers.7. All notifications to the DEP should be addressed to:The Department of Employment and Productivity,1PG B2,8, St James&apos;s Square,&apos;  London, SW1.Public Sector8. Similar arrangements exist in the public sector for reporting informationlo the Government departments concerned.
Confidentiality of Information9. Information which the Government receives under these arrangements will be treated as confidential (although references to the National Board for prices and Incomes-and later to the Commission for Industry and Man-power   will be announced publicly as hitherto).
ARRANGEMENTS FOR NOTIFYINGPROPOSED PRICE INCREASESPart A. general . Proposed price increases should be notified to the appropriate Goyern-ment department (as indicated in part B of this appendix) not less than four weeks before the date from which the price increase is to take elTect. the precise information required in particular cases has been worked out between government departments and the industries concerned. Generally, these arrangements call for information along the following lines to be provided:(i) a description of the goods or services, including any changes beingmade in the product or in the service offered,(ii) the present price and the proposed price and the price trend over theprevious three years,(iii) the annual sales value of the goods or services concerned,(iv) the reason for the price increase and, where this is due to cost increases, an explanation of these together with a statement of thepart played in total costs by, e.g. labour, raw materials and other costs,and (v) an assessment of the justification for the proposed increase in thelight of the guidance given in this White Paper.2. The Government departments concerned also keep under review:(i) the trend of manufacturers&apos; prices of certain goods where advancenotice of individual price increases is not practicable, e.g. because offluctuations in raw material prices. These goods are listed in Part Cof this Appendix,and (ii) the prices of a number of basic foodstuffs. These are listed in Part Dof this Appendix.3. Similar arrangements to the foregoing exist for price increases proposedby nationalised industries and Government departments.4. Information which the Government receives under these arrangements will be treated as confidential (although references to the National Board for prices and Incomes and later to the Commission for Industry and Manpowerwill be announced publicly as hitherto).5. All these arrangements may be subject to amendment from time to timein the light of changing circumstances.

NATIONAL BOARD FOR PRICES AND INCOMES GUIDELINES FOREFFICIENCY AGREEMENTS (INCLUDING productivity agreements)The following guidelines are reproduced from paragraph 133 of NBPIReport No. 123, &quot;Productivity Agreements&quot; (Cmnd. 4136). Each guidelineis accompanied by a brief note intended by the Board to clarify its meaningand intended practical application.1st GuidelineIt should be shown that the workers are contributing towards the achievement of constantly rising levels of efficiency. Where appropriate,major changes in working practice or working methods should be specifiedin the agreement.The objective of efficiency agreements is to make possible the constantraising of efficiency; this will require close and continuing co-operation be-tween managements and workers so as to achieve and maintain the higheststandards in the use of both equipment and manpower. The second sentencehas special reference to agreements which specify major changes in workingpractice to which workers have agreed. Such changes should always be spelledout if there is any possibility that commitments in more general terms will lead to difficulties of interpretation or will not be given full expression inpractice.2nd GuidelineMeasurements of efficiency should be based on the application of relevant indices of performance or work standards.Managements should devise and use appropriate yardsticks for measuringthe contribution of workers of all kinds towards achieving rising levels of efficiency and develop an information system which makes full use of the dataobtained as a result. For many manual operations work-studied standardsare applicable and should be used, but work measurement can also be appliedto a wide range of clerical and other non-manual work. For other workers inother situations it will be necessary to use more broadly-based indicators of performance, if necessary on a group basis.3rd GuidelineA realistic calculation of all the relevant costs of the agreement andof the gains attributable to the workers&apos; contribution should normallyshow that the effect is to reduce the total cost of output or the cost ofproviding a given service.&quot;Relevant costs&quot; may include, for example, the cost of redundancy pay-ments or a proportion of consultants&apos; fees where they are an integral part of anagreement, and these should be apportioned as necessary over a reasonable period rather than charged only to the first year following the agreement.
The &quot;gains attributable to the workers&apos; contribution&quot; may result from more effective working methods, the fuller utilisation of existing capital equipment,the adaptation of working practices lo enable full and prompt use to be madeof new equipment and reduced capital investment (if for example revisedscheduling and shift-working make possible a smaller transport Heel). the reference to a reduction in cosls assumes a calculation for the purpose of whichunrelated cosls, e.g. the price of raw materials, are left out of account.4th GuidelineThere should he effective controls to ensure that projected increases inellieiency are achieved and that higher pay or other improvements aremade only when such increases are assured.In order to observe this guideline managements must operate effectivecontrols, including an information system which makes it possible to estimatein advance and subsequently monitor the extent to which increases in efficiencyare in fact being achieved. In so far as the information system shows thai pro-gress exceeds or falls short of the original projection, some adjustment may need to be made. In any case due allowance should be made for the accrual ofsome of the achieved gain lo the consumer. Particular care also needs lo belaken to distinguish the contribution of workers from other sources of more efficient working.5lh GuidelineThere should he clear benefits to the consumer by way of a contributionto stable or lower prices.This guideline is of particular importance in areas of rapid economic ex-expansion, since the most needs to be made of opportunities to reduce prices inthese areas in order to contribute as much as possible to raising the real incomes of the community as a whole. In some cases the community.may benefit byan improvement in quality while prices remain unchanged or by the use of thegains to compete more effectively in export markets.6th GuidelineAn agreement applying to one group of workers only should hear thecost of consequential increases to other groups, if any have to he granted.An example would be if supervisors have lo be given a pay increase loprevent Ihe disappearance of a differential as a result of a pay increase grantedto the workers whom they supervise. The need for consequential increasesunrelated to increases in ellieiency should, however, be reduced as much aspossible by enabling other groups of workers lo conclude their own elliciencyagreements or by including them within the scope of the original agreement.
7(li (midcliiicNegotiators should avoid selling levels of pay or conditions whichmight have undesirable repercussions elsewhere.Where large increases in pay are shown to be justified negotiators should consider Ihe possibility of staging the increases over a period of time or,alternatively, of a non-recurring lump sum payment, failure to do so mightraise expectations for future increases which could not be fulfilled and might also because of the exceptional size of the increases have repercussions whichwould eventually rebound on Ihe undertaking granting llie original increase.
JOB EVALUATIONI. Attention is drawn to NBPI Report No. S3, &quot;Job Evaluation&quot; (Omul.3772) from which the following information has been taken.2. The Board say that job evaluation means the comparison of jobs not of men by formal procedures to determine their place in a hierarchy and thusoilers a basis for a structure ol pay which, while initially it cannot depart loofar from the historical pattern, can he accepted as having reason behind it.It thus contrasts with ad hoc decisions about Ihe pay of individuals or groupswithout regard lo the pay structure as a whole. Since it is an attempt lo foundan entire structure of pay on rational principles, Ihe Hoard conclude that ilcan diminish tension on Ihe shop floor, and is in this respect a valuableinstrument from the view point of management, and of Ihe unions, and of thecommunity as a whole.3. The Board point out that the introduction of a scheme will normally be attended with an increase in costs, if only because those who have beendowngraded will either receive personal allowances or have their payunchanged, while those who are up-graded will have their pay increased. II isdesirable, therefore, for the introduction of a scheme lo be accompaniedwherever practicable by arrangements making for increased productivity so asto offset as much as possible the extra cost to be incurred. Even in the absence,however, of arrangements relating to productivity, il should be feasible in theBoarcPs view lo estimate the cosl of Ihe scheme as compared with whal labour costs might otherwise have been. II is possible, nonetheless, that the benefit will be long-term and a short-term increase in costs cannot be avoided.4. As far as the maintenance of Ihe scheme is concerned, the Board saythat, while job evaluation establishes a base structure of pay, there is normallyimposed on this structure a super-structure containing a number of componentse.g. merit payment, bonus based on piece rales. Unless these other com-components in pay are controlled Ihe base structure established by job evaluationmay be overwhelmed. To lake account of possible pressures upon the structure,il is important to provide from Ihe beginning for procedures for evaluatingnew and revised jobs.5. Eor the same purpose of controlling all components in pay, Ihe Boardsuggest that:(i) in all companies a senior manager should be made responsible forpay administration, policies and procedures, and for ensuring thaithese are known through Ihe organisation;(ii) the same senior manager lo have as part of his responsibilities theconduct of regular audits of the job evaluation scheme and pay structure at intervals of not more than 3 years. (Where payment by results systems are in operation, Ihey should be audited at the samelime see Appendix 5.)6. The Board recommend thai Ihe audit should:(i) plot current base rates and earnings against grades;(ii) analyse all rcgrading applications over the relevant  period byjustification, type of job and grade;
(iii) examine the percentage distribution of employees between grades andthe reasons for any change;(iv) examine the current relationship between the relationships derivedfrom job evaluation and those implied by other pay components;(v) cheek the number and cost of &quot;personal allowances&quot; in each yearsince the implementation of the scheme to ensure they are decreasingat the projected rate and to assess the feasibility of transfers lo higherevaluated jobs for Ihe workers involved;(vi) check the number, cost and trend of &quot;job allowances&quot;.7. The Board say that they do not envisage pay increases taking place before a job evaluation structure has actually been installed and they emphasise that benefits over time should more than outweigh costs so that some gainmay accrue lo the consumer.
PAYMENT BY RESULTS SYSTEMS1. Attention is drawn to NBPI Report No. 65 &quot;Payment by ResultsSystems&quot; (Cmnd. 3627) from which the following information has been taken.2. The Board say that payment by results (PBR) may be broadly interpretedto mean any system of wage or salary payment which is related to factors in aworkers performance other than time spent at his employees disposal. PBRsystems may be adopted for a number of reasons, of which the most generalis that they arc thought to provide an incentive to greater effort or application.The Board draw a distinction between &quot;conventional&quot; PBR systems, includingindividual or group piecework and incentive bonus schemes, and &quot;alternative&quot;systems to which the term &quot;payment by results&quot; is sometimes applied. Thelatter includes such systems as the several forms of &quot;measured daywork&quot; and various plant-wide incentive schemes. The following relates to conventionalsystems.3. The Board say that the important points are that a scheme should provide an authentic and effective incentive and that it should be under control.They suggest general guidelines for assessing the operation of existing PBRsystems.4. A PBR system is working successfully where: (i) the rate of increase of average hourly earnings (excluding overtimeand increases paid under industry-wide agreements or their equivalent in non-federated firms, and excluding also increases demonstrablyattributable to increased worker effort) is 14% or less a year;(ii) the proportion of average earnings (excluding overtime) which lakesthe form of variable output bonus does not exceed one quartcr*;(iii) standards of performance arc set by work measurement carried outby adequately trained staff whose consistency in rating is regularlychecked;,(iv) enterprise or industry agreements establish clear ground rulesseparating the process of pay negotiation from the selling of workstandards and ensuring uniformity of practice in respect of the latter;(v) the &quot;learning curve&quot; or &quot;improvement effect&quot;! is taken into account when establishing work standards for new jobs and new workers, orrevising them for old jobs;(vi) the differentials between the pay of different occupational groups are determined in detail by job evaluation, or a systematic and com-prehensivc agreement (or both), and are specified, not merely interms of basic rates, but of &quot;standard earnings&quot; or Ihe equivalent;(vii) the suitability and administration of the system has undergone a major investigation within the past 3 years.* This figure is not mcanl lo he interpreted rigidly. Il would apply in a typical case.t The &quot;learning curve&quot; or &quot;improvement ellect&quot; is discussed in paragraphs 45 to 47 of the Board&apos;sReport.
5. The Board give a second set of guidelines which provides signs of loss of control (a "red light") by which firms can identify their payments systems as urgently needing overhaul;

(i) the rate of increase of average hourly earnings (excluding overtime and increases paid under industry-wide agreements or their equivalent in non-federated firms, and excluding also increases demonstrably attributable to increased worker effort) exceeds 21/2% a year;

(ii) the proportion of average earnings (excluding overtime) which takes the form of variable output bonus is over one-third †;

(iii) the use of work study or measured work standards is not attempted by management, or is prevented or limited by workers;

(iv) all or most prices and times are fixed by bargaining between individuals or small groups of workers and management representatives, and there is no clear separation of the processes of standard setting and pay negotiation;

(v) no account is taken of the "learning curve" or "improvement effect" § when establishing work standards for new jobs and new workers, or revising them for old jobs;

(vi) there are obvious anomalies in the pay of different occupational groups, and between workers in different departments;

(vii) the suitability and administration of the system has not been fully investigated within the past 5 years;

(viii) where the information necessary to establish (i) to (vii) is lacking.

6. Where managements find themselves between these positions, they should regard this situation as an "amber light", indicating that control is beginning to slip and should be prepared to take remedial action if it worsens further.

† This figure is not meant to be interpreted rigidly. It would apply in typical case.

§ The "learning curve" or "improvement effect" is discussed in paragraphs 45 to 47 of the Board&apos;s Report.

F-    GUIDANCE^ FOR DETERMINING PRICES AND CHARGES1.      An effective prices policy forms an essential part of anyattempt to secure steady expansion without the inflation whichusually accompanies it,.    In a modern industrial society in which,most industries are dominated by a small number of firms,  it is increasingly difficult to rely on traditional competitive marketforces alone to protect consumers.     Indeed,  there are few partsof the economy in which conditions of even near perfectcompetition exist.    In this situation continuing vigilance overprices is needed.2.      Such vigilance is the more important because price risesinevitably tend to intesify the pressure of wage demands.Unnecessary price rises will therefore exacerbate  the problem of keeping the rise in incomes in line with the rise in output.If workers are to be persuaded not to press inflationary wage claims,   they must have confidence that greater price  stabilitywill follow.    They must be confident also that their  co-operation in increasing productivity and technological developments in industry will be reflected not simply in higher profits but alsoin a reduction in prices as costs are reduced.3.      The need for a positive prices policy grows as themovement towards larger industrial units proceeds.    Market power is being concentrated in a smaller number of firms.    The Governmentrecognises the need for this concentration.    If industry is tomake full use of technological development,  if it is  to command the resources needed for modern research and development,production must in many cases become concentrated in fewer units.That is why the Government established the 1958-59.    That is why it has itself brought forward proposals for rationalisation incertain industries.    That is why it has raised no objections tothe great majority of industrial mergers,4.      Production will therefore in many industries be  concentrated in a few large firms.    But the Government has always recognisedthat this greater size and greater concentration may involverisks to the public intex^est against which proper safeguardsmust be created.    That was one reason why the Government in 1965
F/2extended the monopolies legislation to cover service industries and mergers.    That is one reason why the NBPJ has been asked toexamine proposed price increases in several industries whereproduction is concentrated in a small number of firms.    Thatant,is MmA reason why it is proposed to establish the new commission for Industry and Manpower.5.      The possible dangers from the creation of oligopoly in so many manufacturing and service industries have been clearlyrecognised.    Concentration is intended to yield economies of scale in production and marketing which should be reflected inlower prices.    But where an industry is dominated by a small group of firms their actions must be to a greater extent influenced by the likely reactions of their few main competitors.    In sucha situation the  significance of price competition may be lessenedand other forms of competition assume greater importance.    Or a highly efficient firm may set prices at a level above that whichwould yield an adequate return on capital thus taking the pressureoff the less efficient firms in the industry.6.      Another danger arising from conditions of near monopolyor oligopoly is that the pressure to explore all possible methodsof reducing costs may be lessened by the relative  fase with whichprices can be raised.    This is a particular problem in relationto labour costs.    There is a risk that a dominant firm,  or asmall group of firms,  may not consider it worth their while to try to  secure productivity based pay settlements rather  thaninflationary ones it seems not too difficult to pass on the resultant costs  through higher prices.    In some cases,- a furtherstimulus may be needed to achieve fully efficient use of labourand other resources,  to ensure that pay structures and negotiatingprocedures are designed to relate pay to performance and to avoidleap-frogging settlements.    For example-,  the  development of plantbargaining as against national pay agreements could haveinflationary effects unless there are adequate incentives to avoidsuch inflationary settlements.7.      Enlightened management can and does ensure that thesedangers in industrial concentration are avoided,  and itsadvantages secured.    The principles underlying the prices
IV 3policy are widely accepted and applied by industry.    Moreover,as import tariffs are being reduced British industry has to takegreater account of competition from firms abroad and thisprovides a new protection to the consumer in some parts of the economy.    But the need will remain for machinery through whichthe community can be satisfied that the principles are being applied in particular cases.8.      The conditions to be satisfied before price increases arcmade were first  set out  in the White Pajocr on Prices and incomes policy in April,   1965.    They are reproduced in appendix 6.Two major points are involved.    First,   there  can. be no questionof simply passing on in higher prices particular increases in costs of labour,  materials or capital.    The economic andfinancial position of the enterprise must be  considered as a whole.An increase in labour costs or material costs may well be offset by reductions in other costs.    Any attempt automatically to passon particular increases in cost is quite contrary to this principle.9.     The second major point is that full and realistic account must be taken in considering price  levels of the possibilitiesof cost  savings to offset  cost increases.in whole  or part  through-out the  firms activities.    This must take account not  only of savings alroady achieved but also of the opportunities thatexist to reduce costs in the future.    This is the principle whichhas been applied by the NBPI in considering proposals  for price increases, in both the private and public sectors.10.    Taking the economy as a whole,  labour costs are overwhelminglythe largest single element in the final prices of the goods and services bought by consumers.    However,     the upward trend in productivity means  that unit labour costs will not be risingas fast as wage and salary rates.    Proposals  for price increases which include any element to cover increases  in labour costsneed therefore the most  careful scrutiny.    Most firms ought  tobe able to absorb all,  or most,  of the cost of pay settlementswhich fall within the normal range.    Firms will be expected toshow good grounds for not absorbing at least this amount of thecost of any pay settlement.    The  cost of any settlements arisingfrom an efficiency/productivity agreement should automatically be
F/kmet - an indeed more than met - from the savings flowing fromthe agreement,11.    The prices of some products - particularly foodstuffs andraw materials - are much affected by changes in the supplies available  for seasonal or other reasons.     Increased prices will then be unavoidable;  but where prices rise for these reasons theyshould fall again when supplies are plentiful.12.    Decisions on price levels  inevitably involve decisions onthe appropriate level  of return on the  capital  employed in thebusiness.    No  single figure  can be appropriate  either for all industries,   or for all firms in a particular industry.Exceptional efficiency,  rapid technical innovation or a high degree of risk may properly be associated with a higher return on capital in a particular firm or industry than would be appropriate for others.    The return on capital achieved inrecent years  in a particular firm is however not somethingsacresanct,     It requires to be  examined in the light of changing circumstances  and is always relevant to the  consideration of price increases.     In some  cases,   increases in costs  can andshould be absorbed in whole or in part by a reduction in the profit margins,    The Government will continue to  examine withspecial  care price increases proposed where  the return on capitalhas been maintained at a high level in a situation where pricecompetition is weak.    On the other hand,  price increases maysometimes be  essential  if firms are  to  secure,   either byploughingback profits or by attracting capital in the open market,resources  essential to  enable them to modernise and expand their production and to reduce costs.    Indeed in some efficiententerprises the return on capital may for  special reasons havefallen to so low a level as to  jeopardise their long-termfuture.    The Government does not believe that any general reduction in the level of return on capital invested in Britishindustry, where privately or publicly owned,  would be helpful inthe context of the essential modernisation of the economy.    but what is true of the average level is not necessarily true of individual enterprises.
F/513.     In short,   the  aim of prices policy is not to keep all priceslow at any cost.     It is to ensure in each, enterprise that changesin prices genuinely reflect  costs  and take account of thepossibility of cost  savings.,     General price  stability onix beachieved only if,   in certain, sectors,  price reductions occur to offset inevitable increases  elsewhere.     In these  sectors  of the economy where  technical innovation or rationalisation of facilities  offers  opportunities  for cost reductions well  inexcess of the national average,   this needs to be reflected in price reductions.    A prices  and incomes policy which worksfairly for the whole  community requires  that the whole benefit ofthe  cost reductions in these  sectors should not go  to  the workers and shareholders in the firms concerned.    The circumstances inwhich price reductions are called for are set out in Appendix 6,
SECTION G      GUIDANCE IN &quot;RELATION TO DIVIDENDS1.   Prom the outset of the policy in 196k the Government hsSemphasised its intention to use its fiscal powers or appropriate means to correct any excessive growth in aggregate profits, whetherdistributed or not, as compared with the growth of total wagesand salaries,  after allowing for short-term fluctuations in profitlevels.    Total company profits,   as well as the profits of individual companies,  may fluctuate considerably from year to year,    whereas the total of wages and salaries increases year &quot;by year.    The trend in profits and dividends is therefore normallymore relevant to prices and incomes policy than the figures for particular years for individual companies.2.   In I968 the Government introduced a 3h/0 ceiling on increases in individual company dividends as a necessary reinforcement of themore general policy of restraint.    It was always intended as ashort-term measure associated with the stringent powers overother incomes and prices introduced at that time.    Although thepolicy provided for increases in the dividends of individual companies the total of dividends paid on ordinary shares in 1968was in fact less than the amounts paid in either 1965 or 1966. Thefigures are given in the table below: -Dividends on Ordinary Sharesr  million1965 1,7351966 1,6871967 1,5761968 1,630.   Source: CSO3.   On general grounds a ceiling for dividends paid out by individual companies is undesirable as a long-term policy,  and-1-
CONFBDENT1ALand it involves substantial disadvantages in particular cases.For example,  fixed dividends limits can affect the ability of companies to raise in the open market additional capital needed for the efficient functioning of their business.    A fixed limitmay expose firms to take-over bids on terms which do not fairlyreflect the value of the undertaking to be acquired.    In timealso, fixed limits would imps a the flow of capital into themost productive channels.k.    Moreover,  a rigid control of dividend payments by individual companies may not in itself reduce in the long term the shareof the national product accruing to owners of capital .Enforced retention by companies of profits may to some extent be reflected in the long term in capital gains which can berealised.    Although therefore limitation of dividends may be helpful as a short term measure,   it is not necess-Drily in thelong term an effective instrument of greater social equity,which is better achieved by taxation and other means.5.    For these reasons the 3^/0 ceiling scheme for dividendssill come to an end on December 31st, 1969.    However,  the needfor moderation in the distribution of profits to shareholdersremains as a proper counter-part       the other elements ofthe prices and incomes policy.    Under Part II of the Prices and incomes Act 1966,  the Government will continue to have thepower to require notification of individual dividend increasesif this seems desirable.    It will also continue to have the powerto refer to the N.B.P.I.-and later to the CIM -    cases wherethe growth of profits and dividends appear to be based on price levels made possible by excessive market power;  ond will do soin appropriate cases.    However,  since dividends of quotedcompanies are public knowledge,  the Government does notconsider it necessary at the present time to ask for notification of dividends declared.- 2 -
