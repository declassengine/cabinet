HIS DOCUMENT 23 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majestys GOVERNMENT) 1691.168COPY NO.16 th i J)   glsbggA-Li^CABINETTHE GENEVA PftOTOCOL AND USE OFNote by the Prjhna MmisterThe parties to the Geneva Protocol of 1925 renounced the use against each other in war of asphyxiating;, poisonous, or other gases,and of ail analogous liquids, materials or devices.    In February,, 1930the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs,Mr. Dalton, in reply to a Parliamentary Question on the scope of the protocol, said 2&quot;Smoke screens are not considered poisonous and do not therefore come within the terms of the Geneva Gas Protocol.Tear gases and shells producing poisonous fumes are,,however, prohibited under the Protocols, !sin November, 193QS in a memorandum to the Preparatory Commission forthe League of Nations Disarmament Conference9 the United KingdomGovernment stated the view that the Protocol applied to Lachrymatorygases.    Delegates from 11 other governments accepted this \view,     Theonly other delegate to make a statement at the time was that of the UnitedStates, who held that, the question should be given further study.2.     We are likely soon to be required to say whether we remain of theview which we stated in 1930,    The subject has again become topical for two mam reasons.    The first is that it has engaged the attention of theUnited Nations and of the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament in geneva.    The second is that the United States Government has recentlydecided to renounce the first use of incapacitating chemical weapons, whileadding that it interprets the Geneva Protocol as permitting the use in war of riot control agents (such as CS gas which has been used recently by our forces in Northern Ireland),,     In answer to queries from the WashingtonEmbassy, the Americans explained that they regard incapacitating chemicalsas &quot;agents such as the psycho-chemical BZ which produce systematicsymptons, e. g. headache, nausea, incomer dictation 8 which last for hoursor days after removal from exposure!&quot; and that the United States wasrenouncing the right to make first use of such agents, while reserving theright to make use ia war of agents which have transient effects disappearingwithin minutes of removal from exposure and which are widely uned by governments for domestic riot control.    it is understood that this Americanreservation applies not only to CS but also to the earlier form of tear gasCN, and to the vomiting gas DM,
3,     On the other han.df it can be maintained that chemical, agents,,whether regarded as lethal or incapacitating (including harassingmaterials) are all toxic agents.    The terms &quot;lethal&apos;8 and &quot;incapacitating&quot;agents are not absolute terms but imply statistical probabilities ofresponse,    Toxicity of -these gases varies in different animal species andin different environmental conditions,,      Depending on circumstances^, not all individuals will die from an attack with a given lethal agent, whereaspagain depending on circumstances8 some might succumb to an attack withan incapacitating agent.    Normally tear gases (lachrymators) used as riotcontrol agents have a negligible par lability of fatal outcome, butlachrymators have been widely used in warfare as harassing agents, inorder to enhance the effectiveness of conventional weapons.    From ascientific point of view, CS may be iar less lethal than ether agents of war,but it cannot be differentiated qualitatively from other agents which, we regard as banned,,4.     Up to now it has been possible to avoid making any statement ofHer Majesty!s Governments present interpretation of the Protocol, butit is clear that, sooner rather than later, we shall be asked to say whetheror not we regard our forces as free to use riot control agents in wai%The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee has therefore considered thelegaL, foreign policy and defence implications of the matter, and hasconcluded that there are in practice two possible courses of actions(a) To reaffirm the 1930 interpretation of the. 1925 Protocol without qualification;, while making it clear that we would not object, ifany other  state expressed the view (as the Americans have)that the Protocol does not prohibit the use in war of riot controla gents 0(b) To reaffirm, our 1930 statement,, but to explain that the use inwar of recently developed riot control agents such as CS, whichwe did not regard as significantly harmful., was not in our viewcovered by the Protocol,5.     The arguments in favour of each of these courses of action are summarised Ln Annexes A and B 3v*$ao pd,,  Annex C contains a summaryof a note by the Attorney-General on ihe legal aspects.6.     The majority of the Committee favoured the couz^se of actionsummarised at 4(b) above    But they felt that the Cabinets before beinginvited to endorse this conclusion^, shoxiild have an opportunity to considerthe political repercussions of a statement on these lines.10 Downing Streei?

ANNEX .ASUMMARY OF THE VIEWS OF THE FOREIGN and commonwealth office the United States and Australia are the only members of the united nations whose Governments have stated that they regard riot control agentsas excluded from the prohibition contained in the Geneva Protocol,    It is widely known that in 1930 the United Kingdom Government took the lead in trying to establish that the prohibition applied to the use of tear gas in war.If we were now to adopt the opposite interpretation we should lay ourselvesopen to charges of having done so in order to please the United states administration and because we approved of the way in which the americans have used riot control agents in the war in Vietnam,    Such action would gravely prejudice oixv standing in the interactional disarmament negotiations and the reputation which Britain now justly enjoys as the country which hastaken the lead in trying to deal with the growing menace of chemical andbiological weapons,2,     In theory8 riot control agents could be used in war, at any rateagainst an enemy which did not have gas masks g to save life rather than totake it*    But in practice they have frequently been used in Vietnam to force the enemy into the open so that he can more easily be attacked withconventional weapons.    To date, something like 7,000 tons of CS have been used in military operations in Vietnam, and the weapons involved have notjust been grenades which are lobbed by hand, but high capacity spraydevices? long range artillery shell and heavy bombs0    It would be flying in the face of the facts to say that this agent has been used In Vietnam inaccordance with the principle of minimal force,,    Furthermore, in circum-stances in which both sides have gas weapons, escalation might inevitablyoccur,3.     It has been argued that CS is so much less toxic than older teargases, that its invention has created an entirely new situation.   But the geneva Protocol prohibits the use in war of &quot;asphyxiating-, poisonou.f3or other gases&quot;, and the fact that CS is neither asphyxiating nor poisonousin normal quantities is irrelevant^ it is still an &quot;other&quot; gasj like thelachrymatory and other irritant gaset; treated as noxious substances by theLeague of Nations experts in their report of 1924,    The summary of anote by the Attorney-General at Annex C is relevant here,,    Moreover, the americans have not used only CS in Vietnam,   In the earlier stages of thewar they also used the vomiting gas DM, and they have used the tear gas CNSwhich was invented in 1869, and came into general use for riot control soon after World War 1* before the Geneva Protocol was drafted.    CS is lesstoxic than CN during brief exposure but has more extensive physical effectsthan CN, producing sharp buraing pains   in nose8 throat and chest andcausing a ehoking sensation.-1-
^4,     It could bo argued that. It would be illogical to permit the use of cm gas in peace agalnot our own citizens while prohibiting its use in war against the enemy,    However, when used in peace it is used as an alter-native to potentially lethal weapons? in war, the risk of its being used toincrease the effect of lethal weapons, or cf its use resulting in eocalation^is so great that the wisest, course is to prohibit it altogether.       But if wewere to reaffirm trie Labour Go-&quot;ernment!s 1930 interpretation we should still be legally free to use CS to deal with disturbances of any kind in ourdependent territories, or indeed in any situation short of an internationalarmed conflict,50     The Americans do not expect, us to adopt their interpretationsthey have not asked us to,    What they want is acceptance that there isambiguity in the wording of the Protocol, and that their interpretation ispermissiblea    They are likely to be grateful for any lead we can give inthis direction,-2-
ANNEXESSUMMARY OF THE VIEWS OF THE MINISTRY OF defence i.       CS, which in scientific terms is a smoke and not a gas, can bebrought within the terms of the Geneva Protocol only on the grounds thatit is significantly harmful or deleterious to man,    This argument is bothincorrect and politically damaging(a) It is not true that CS is significantly harmful or deleteriousto man.    It is no more toxic than screening smoke in similar concentrations, and this is not banixed by the ProtocolsAnd it is only a third to a quarter as toxic as Gfl, which it haswidely replaced,,    Although it is possible to postulate extremecircumstances in which, like wood smoke, exhaust gases andeven human breaths it could be harmful, no case has beenauthoritatively recorded in which it has caused significantharm to man;  it causes only sharp and temporary discomfort.(b) If it were argued that CS smoke was significantly harmful to man,it would be very difficult to justify its use in civil riots or in helping to arrest dangerous criminals,,    Yet the use of CSsmoke in these circumstances has often saved innocent liveswithout causing harm to those against whom it was used.    Andit provides the Police and the Army with a much more humaneoption than batons, bayonets, bullets or bombs02.     It has been suggested that its most likely use in war would be to&quot;flush out&quot; an enemy in order to kill him by other means,,(i)   But the use of CS to &quot;flush out88 an enemy offers the option of taking prisoners, and is therefore much better, even inthis role, than its immediate alternatives, napalm andhand grenades,,    In fact, even in Vietnam., the Americansus it for this purpose only in a minority of cases? and theyhave told  us privately that they intend to renounce this usein the future,(ii)    H CS were banned on these groundsv we would be logical toban also the other methods of &quot;flushing&quot; enemies, such assmoke screenings fire, flooding and defoliants,(iii)    In any case, there are no grounds whatever for believing that it was with this use of tear gas in mind thatMr. Dalton argued in 1930 that fcea.r gas was covered bythe Geneva Protocol.3.     The fact is that since 1930 science has provided the Army and thePolice with a humane and harmless alternative to older methods.    CS hashelped to keep down the number of injuries and deaths in Northern Ireland,and it can be used with advantage in a variety of situations in v/ar and peaceas a means of limiting conflict and hence preserving life.-1-,
4.      The United States Government has made it clear that it isprepared to accept the 1925 Geneva Protocol only on the basis that it doesnot ban the vise in war o  riot control agents0    It would be impossible tojustify an unqualified reaffirmation by Her majesty&apos;s Government of the protocol without deploying arguments which,, besides being unsound(see paragraph 1 above), would also focus pablic attention on differences between the United States and ourselves j would allow every country inthe world to adopt its own interpretation of the Protocols and would causeendless difficulties over definition of substances and the circumstances inwhich they could be used.    It is difficult to see how this could improveBritain&apos;s posture in the disarmament negotiations,,5,     On the assumption that the abandonment of the 1930 interpretation of the Protocol is regarded as politically unacceptable, we should reaffirmit subject to the explanation that, since technology in the last 40 years has provided us with a smoke which is neither asphyxiating nor poisomm&amp;*nor significantly harmful or deleterious to man - and which provides ahumane alternative to other weapons - we do not consider that it is covered by the Protocol.    The mail?, agent we have in mind at present isCS, but other agents might be developed in future.    We would certainlyproscribe mustard gas and the older forms of tear  gae such as CN andvomiting gas such as DM.     This interpretation would be strongly borne out by the use in the French text of the word Hsimilaires&quot; where theEnglish text refers to &quot;other&quot; gases, and it would be broadly in line withthe distinction drawn by the Americans between &quot;incapacitating chemicals&quot;and &quot;riot control agents&quot;.-2-
ANNEX CSUMMARY OF A NOTE BY THE ATTORNEY-general.      The Geneva Protocol^, 1925, prohibits the use in war of*&apos;aephyxj.atiiigP poisonous or ether gases&quot;,,    The question is whether&quot;other gases&quot; include tear gases,2,     The terms of the Protocol do not unambiguously include teargases.    Some limit has to be implied in &quot;other gases&apos;\ otherwisebenefic*nl gases like osygen might be included.   It is a question of deciding where to draw the line.    Legal considerations suggest thatcertain cocvV-conclusions are to be preferred,3a     The word &quot;other&quot; in the phrase &quot;other gases&quot; refers to gaseswhich are neither asphyxiating nor poisonous.    The use of &quot;other&quot;immediately following &quot;asphyxiating&quot; and &quot;poisonous&quot; suggests thatthese &quot;other gase6&quot; roust share certain characteristics of asphyxiatingand poisonous gases.    It does not in my view contemplate that thegases must be lethal or permanently damaging.    Nor is the degree ofinhumanity a criterion which can in law be read into the Protocol,,4,     The factor shared by asphyxiating and poisonous gases whichgoverns the meaning of &quot;other&quot; is that they are significantly harmful ordeleterious to man,    The French text &quot;ou simiiaires&quot; suggests the samecollusion,50      The information supplied to me suggests that tear gases aresignificantly harmful or deleterious to man.    The development of CS gaswith lower toxicity than tear gases used in the first World War does notplace CS gas outside the Protocol,,    The interpretation of the Protocol asprohibiting all gases which are significantly harmful or deleterious to man,applies to such gases known in 1925 or developed later,    CS gas despite itssophistication;, is still significantly harmful or deleterious to man, aswitness uses of it in Vietnam, and the Home Officers recent warning toChief Constables,60     Some borderlfcie cases cause difficulty9 e, g0 gases which are used as a smoke screen.    These are not prohibited by the Protocol,In applying the Protocol I think it right to take into account the xwfcspwof the normal use to which a gas is put,    CS gas as normally usedproduces - and is intended to produce - effects sufficiently harmful asseriously (although temporarily) to incapacitate people stayiug within itsrange, whereas screening gases normally used do not.To     The prohibition of the use of tear gases is somewhat anomaloussince they are not prohibited for internal purposes0    This does not prevent the adoption of an interpretation of the Protocol which on other grounds is legally justified,,    There are other areas ha which a. statersfreedom to act in international matters is more restricted than its freedom in purely domestic matters? further,, it was fully recognised
internationally in the 1930!s that the continued use and lawfulness of tearga;: tfor &amp;&amp;y.ernal purposes was compatible with its unlawfulness during warand a state is not wholly free to use tear gases even internally withwhatever freedom it wishes.,8.     The interpretation of the Protocol in relation to tear gases must take account of Her Majesty! a Government publicly adopted interpretationin 1930 that tear gases were within the scope of the Protocol,     To take adifferent view now requires very convincing evidence justifying a change,and this does not exist.    The views of other States in the 1930!s, taken together with our own stand at the time, is very persuasive as to theinterpretation given to the Protocol near the time when it was concluded,The negotiating history of the Protocol sheds little light on the properinterpretation but the inclusion of tear gases within the Protocol . wos&amp;Jdnot be inconsistent with the general circumstances leading to the adoptionof the PTotocol.9.     While the matter is not beyond some doubt, it is in law in myopinion very much the better view that tear gasesp and in particularGS gas, are within the Geneva Protocol.-2-
