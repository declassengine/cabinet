(THIS DOCUMEMT IS THE PROPERTY OP HER BRITAjWK! MAJESTYlS GOVERNiiCEMT)4th December J-9.69CABINETCONCOrjTEMemorandum by the Llini&amp;tj3ii^i\Teohnolo[^fThe Cabinet decided at its meeting on 25th March(CC(69) 14th Conclusions, Minute 4) to postpone a decision on whether ornot to withdraw fron the Concorde project until the end of 1969.   Ishall be mooting M. Mondon, the French Minister of Transport, on18th Dooonber and need then to be in a position to tell hin whether wopropose to continue with the project after the end of the year and, if so, on what basis.Prog^qss,. of ^tho^, fjijjjht tost s2.     Since their first flights earlier this year the French end theBritish prototypes have between then completed 150 hours of test flying.The French prototype has now reached a Hach number of 1 .3 and isexpected to reach 11=1.4 before, in accordance with the programme, it isgrounded for necessary modifications.     The British prototype which is atpresent grounded for planned modifications should start flying againearly in 1970 and will then extend the flight regime up to the oarcraffscruising speed of 1=2.3.     The results from the flight tests so far are extremely satisfactory.The handling qualities are very good over the wholo speed rangeinvestigated so far and the behaviour of the aeroplane and its engines isexcellent.    The flight trials havo proceeded during these early stages inthe programme much faster than officials would have expected in viewof the complexity of the aircraft and its flight programme.4.     Concorde has now been flown at subsonic and supersonic speeds bypilots from Air Franco, BOAC, Pan An and OTA.   The pilots flew thoaircraft up to a Mach number of 1 ,2 and were allowed to investigateemergency and failure conditions without restriction.   The emergencies-1-COPY NO.
included flying the aircraft with three major components inoperativeduring approach - &apos;thc worst handling caso we are likely to face&apos; - and deliberate engine failure at supersonic speed and during take-off andon landingo   Their joint report concludes:   &quot;For all the flight conditionsflown during this first phase the aircraft was pleasant and easy to fly, imposed no excessive workload on the pilot oven in failure conditions,and there should be no problems in training airline pilots and engineersto handle the aircraft&quot;.The tests still to be done5*     It is expected that some measurements of performance at 1,1=2 can be made by the end of Juno 1970.   The results of the full Mach 2 tests Trillnot, however, bo fully assessed in the terns of the likely performance ofproduction aircraft before next Autumn,   There will still be some uncertainty about the likely performance of production aii-craft but thepresent wide margins of uncertainty in officials&apos; estimates (seeparagraph 12 below) should be significantly reduced.6.     The firms&apos; target date for obtaining a certificate of airworthinessis mid-1973 with the aim of having a few promotion production aircraftdelivered and in service in time for the summer of 1973*   Officials1estimate remains that the most likely date for certification is betweenend 1973 and mid 1974*   Boeings target date for entry into serviceof the United States Supersonic Transport (US/SST) is 1978; bearing inmind&apos;the present status of the two programmes, officials consider thatConcorde has a lead of at least five years over the -American aircraft.The latest Concorde Directing niCgjnnittoe Report7*    The latest report to British and French Ministers by the ConcordeDirecting Committee is at Annex A.     The present position is summarised below.Paylo ad/jtexige j?e rf ormance8.    Officials&apos; current estimate of the payload at entry into service is between 500 lb and 1,500 lb less than the estimate of 15,0001b which reported last March (C(69) 27) as compared with the target payload oninitial entry into service for the Paris/New York summer design mission of20,000lb,     Officials consider, however, that improvements to the-2-
propulsion system now under active development by the fims could lead toa payload at entry into service of 16,000 lb to 17,000 lb.   Officialsfurther consider that these improvements combined with minor changes in operating conditions (speed and holding altitude and a slight reductionin the regularity of service) should allow the target payload of20,000 lb at entry into service to be achieved.   Provided the aircraft is acceptable in other respects, these changes should be acceptable toairline s.9.     Since March the firms&apos; estimates of payload have diminished by aboutthe same amount as those of the Concorde Directing Committee (CDC) butthey continue to bo 11,000 lb to 12,000 lb above officials&apos; estimates.The firms would accept that some of this difference represents an optimisticview on their part but they still consider that they can achieve a payloadof 20,000 lb at entry into service without resorting to. changes in operating conditions or regularity,10.   The reductions in officials estimates of performance at entry into service apply also to their estimates to be achieved about two yearsafter entry into service.     iarlines would not accept reductions inregularity at this time and officials therefore consider that a fundamentalredesign of tho nozzle system is necessary if the aircraft target payloadtwo years after entry into service of 25,000 lb is to be assured.11.   Preliminary studies completed so far by the firms suggest that a fundamental redesign of the nozzle system would increase paj^loads byabout 5,000 lb.   Officials will not be able to make a firm judgment ofthe validity of this redesign or its likely cost until June 1970 whenfirms will have submitted a detailed assessment.   The cost of thisredesigned nozzle would be substantial.12.   Officials&apos; basic estimate of the performance is itself subjectto considerable uncertainty (i about 8,000 lb) which cannot be reducedsubstantially until the autumn of 1970 when results from sustained flightof the prototype at supersonic cruise speed should have been assessed.Offioials&apos; present estimates of pry load thus still cover a bracket whichat its higher end would lead to the conclusion that Concorde will be a technical success but which at the lower end would lead to the conclusionfeat Concorde would be a technical failure.-3-
13*   Although there is still this uncertainty about Concorde!s performance,there is no reason, at present on technical grounds to believe that Concordewill not achieve its payload/range target, or to justify our withdrawing from the project on technical grounds.Airfiel/dJ^oi^se14.   Noise measurements have now been made on the two prototype aircraft.Those suggest a marginal decrease (1-2 perceived noise in decibels(PN&amp;B) in flyover and lateral noise but the remaining uncertainties are such that officials do not wish to revise their assessment at the presenttine.   The measurements indicate an increase in the estimate of approachnoise bringing Concorde&apos;s noise levels up to those of current civil aircraft.   officials current assessment of the position is as follows -Approach noise is likely to be about the sane as that of the boeing 707 or DC 8 aircraft;Lateral noise will almost certainly be higher than that ofexisting aircraft - the most likely figure being about 3 PNdBhigher;Flyover noise on some days is likely to be 2/3 PNdB above the levels currently permitted at London and New York.15*   As a result of full scale ground tests on a preliminary version of an improved silencer the firms consider that noise levels for flyovercould be reduced by about 2 PNdB and for lateral by about 1 PNdB.Officials believe that there is a good chance of these improved silencersbeing available for entry into service assuming officials estimate ofend 1973/mid 1974.16,   While therefore engine noise remains a cause of concern, thesituation is more encouraging than when I last reported in that the uncertainties have boon substantially reduced and there is now betterprospect of Concorde meeting existing noise levels at Kennedy andHeathrow on entry into service.-4-
Development Costs17.   In March 1969 the CDC reported that their latest estimate, at January1969 prices, was  727-841m.; converted to a January 1966 price basis thisbecame  596-680m.   Since that date estimates have been affected by wage andoverhead increases on both sides of the channel, by the devaluation of the franc, and by a number of minor adjustments to the programme.   The net effectof these changes is to produce an estimate of  727m. at current prices,exactly the same as tho January 1969 estimate though of course at a laterprioo basis.   This estimate does not however include any allowance for further increases in overhead rates at the four firms as a result of the delay instarting the production programme.   Nor does it include any allowance for thedevelopment cost of a substantially improved nozzle.18.   Because of devaluation, the upper bracked of the development cost hasbeen marginally reduced.   This gives a revised estimate at current prices of 727-836,.   Converted to January 1966 prices this becomes  601-680m.   A tablecomparing the estimates at the various price bases is at Annex B.Attitude of the airlines and airline orders19.   The present options, which have already been renewed once, expire atthe end of June 1970.   Officials consider however that, assuming the results from flight trials at 1=2 can be assessed by the autumn of 1970, the firstairline orders are unlikely to be placed until the first quarter of 1971.   Afurther renewal of the options will therefore be necessary.20.   BOAC and Air France are now considered to hold the key to airline orders.Other airlines are unlikely to place orders for Concorde until they are sure that it will be coming into service with BOAC and Air France.   Pan Am, inParticular, would because of their difficult financial position like to delayordering Concorde in the immediate future but would no doubt feel alsoobliged to order the aircraft if they knew it would be operated by its competitors.-5-SSjECRHT
21.   BOAC say that the studies they have carried out so far suggest thatirrespective of the route operated Concorde is likely to worsen their financial position.   BOAC have so far refused to commit themselves to expenditure forecasts which imply they will buy Concorde unaided.   They have in the past suggested that the Government might buy Concordes and lease themto BOAC.   The recent precedent of aid for BEA following orders for the bac 1-11/500 and the Trident JB will not have escaped their notice.   There istherefore a strong possibility that they will refuse to operate Concordewithout a subsidy.   Studies however by an outside consultant suggest thatBOAC should be able to operate Concorde profitably.Commercial Prospects22.   I agreed with M. Mondon at our meeting on 22nd September that UnitedKingdom and French officials should up-date the 1967 report of the ConcordeEconomic Prospects Committee (CSPC).   The French, however, in the event have been reluctant to devote any effort to this task and in the time available it has proved possible to do no noro than to have an initial exchange of views on the assumptions that should be used in up-dating the CEPC report.The United Kingdom Members (Treasury, Foreign Office, Board of Trade, Mintech)under the chairmanship of Mr. Jukes of the Ministry of Transport have therefore produced their own report, a copy of which is at Annox C.23.   Assessments of the likely market for Concorde vary considerably.   BACat a selling price of $22m. forecast sales of 250 aircraft up to 1980.   AMintech market study, upon which the CEPC assessments are based suggests, ata higher selling price of $26n. (officials latest estimate of the selling price for 100 aircraft), a central estimate of sales of 135, with a possiblevariation of f 45.24.   The CEPCs conclusion is that at a soiling price of $26m. sales of concorde up to 1980 are likely to fall within a range of 50-150 with thebalance of probability being that sales will fall towards the bottom end oftho range rather than towards the top.25.   Tho foreign exchange benefits and implied preferences associated withthese estimates are as follows;(iTOTEs   All money figures (col. 2-6) in the&apos;following tables are in  m.and net of import content      8 per cent of cost).   The discountedfigures have been discounted to present values at 10 per cent).-6-

In assessing tho market for Concorde there are a number of considerableuncertainties such as how much passengers will be prepared to pay for speed, loadfactors and the effect of competition from the United States SST.   Inevitably,therefore, any market estimate involves a number of subjective judgements.   Iconsider the BAC estimate to be optimistic.   But I really do not feel able in viewof all the uncertainties to give a personal assessment of where the market forConcorde is likely to lie within tho very wide range in the estimates produced bythe CEPC and the Mintech study. he present financial position27.   The total United Kingdom share of Concorde extramural development costs of-727s. at current prices is now estimated at  352n., of which over  200m. will havetoon spent by December 31st 1969.   If Concorde wore cancelled at that datoadditional cancellation costs would probably amount to between  20m. and  30m.-7-SECRET
Assuming that there is no further escalation in tho basic estimate of  352m.,cancellation on December 31st would therofore imply a saving of about  120m.,to which should be added about  15m. of outstanding intramural and othermiscellaneous development costs.    If we continue to June 30th 1970 wo shallincur a further  25m. on extramural development plus  2/3m. on intramuraldevelopment and  7m. on production: say  35m. in all.   Cancellation on June 30th1970 would thus imply a not saving of a little under  100m.   If wo continueto December 31st 1970 we shall incur a further  25m. on extramural development,and  3m. on intramural development and  11m. on productionj say  75m. in all.Cancellation on December 31st 1970 would thus imply a net saving of  55m,Those figures do not take account of any possible losses that might be incurred on production.Production Programme28.   In addition to the manufacture of the first three aircraft which will beused in the flight test programme, both the French and ourselves have recentlygiven authority for the firms to incur commitments until the end of the year on the start of manufacture of aircraft 4-6, the ordering of some long datedmaterials for aircraft 7-10 and material ordering for initial batch ofproduction engines.Production Financing29.   The working capital required for Concorde production is currently being-assessed but will be substantially in excess of the  125m. provision in theIndustrial Expansion Act.    It is envisaged that the banks will lend up to 25m. with a Government guarantee, and the Government will lend the rest.    Inaddition up to  30m. will be required for special capital assets.   We have also accepted that the Companies should be indemnified in certain circumstancesagainst the liability to repay the money and against losses on production.   the sums at risk could be considerable.   I warned the House at the time of theIndustrial Expansion Bill (Official Report, 13th March, 1968, Col. 1547) that inthe extreme circumstances of a cataslarophe  to the project at a late stage theGovernment&apos;s total liability on production could amount to  200m.-8-
SECRET

30. The negotiations with the United Kingdom companies suggest that there is little possibility of persuading BAC to accept the risk of losses on the first 100 aircraft and Rolls Royce the risk of losses on the first 260 engines. The only scheme which at this stage seems to be negotiable is one in which the companies would receive a minimum return on capital employed, although one substantially below the standard non-risk rate for Government contracts, even if the particular aircraft batch or production programme as a whole resulted in a loss to the Government.

Discussion with the French

31. In a letter of 5th September (copy at Annex D) agreed with the Attorney General, I wrote to M. Mondon setting down our interpretation of my agreement(copy at Annex E) with his predecessor M. Chamant. At my meeting with M. Mondon on 22nd September I stressed the importance we attached to that agreement. In particular, I emphasised that we considered any automatic obligation to continue would have ceased after the end of 1969 and any future commitment thereafter would only be such as the two Governments might from time to time agree. M. Mondon would not accept this interpretation and challenged the basis of my agreement with M. Chamant which he suggested related to the date of Mach 2 flights and not the end of 1969. Eventually we agreed, without prejudice to our respective legal positions to set up a Working Group of officials to make proposals to the two Governments by 30th November 1969 on the best way for the Governments jointly to pursue Concorde.

32. This Working Group has been unable to reach agreement on the legal position. The United Kingdom members of the Working Group tabled the proposal that, if we decided to go ahead with the project, it should be continued by stages agreed from time to time and that in the event of disagreement at the end of any stage it would be open to either Government to withdraw if it wished to do so. The French have rejected this proposal as unacceptable. In their view it would not be reasonable for one Government to withdraw unless a serious problem had arisen when both Governments would wish to withdraw; and future decisions should be arrived at jointly as envisaged in the original Memorandum of Understanding.

33. In view of this failure to reach agreement on the legal position, the Working Group will probably recommend (the United Kingdom draft of their report is at Annex F) that the best way of proceeding with the project would be to continue in the first instance until June 1970 without prejudice to the respective legal positions of the two Governments; and to review the position at the end of June 1970.


SECRET

34. I am quite clear that there is no prospect of persuading the French to accept our interpretation of the legal position and prolonging the legal argument can in my view only sour Anglo/French relationships which could well have adverse repercussions in wider fields.

Legal Position

35. The Attorney General&apos;s advice (a copy of the Attorney&apos;s opinion is at Annex G) is that we need no longer attach the same weight as hitherto to the consideration that unilateral withdrawal night involve us in the payment of damages; and that while we could not be sure of success before the International Court if we decided to withdraw from the project at the end of the year, the Court would, in view of the uncertainties and the amount of money still at stake, be likely to find in our favour.

36. The Attorney further considers that, if we wish to continue with the project after the end of the year, this could be done on a basis that did not prejudice our case that any automatic obligation to continue with the project ends at the end of this year and that any future commitment extends only so far as we may from time to time agree. It would obviously be preferable if we could get the French to accept our interpretation of the position. But as I have indicated above there is no prospect of this. The Attorney considers that in these circumstances we would safeguard our case by making it clear that our continuation of the project was without prejudice to our interpretation of our legal position as set out in my letter to M. Mondon on 5th September.

Possible courses of action

37. There are, I suggest at this stage three possible courses of action:

(i) to withdraw from the project at the end of 1969

(ii) to continue until June of 1970.

(iii) to continue until December 1970.

Course No. 1

38. The present prospects of Concorde are not in my view such that we should or could justify withdrawing from the project at the end of the year. The flight tests have gone extremely well, better than any one anticipated they would have done. The performance is necessarily still uncertain but officials


SECRET

believe Concorde can achieve its target payload. Nor do I consider that there is any chance of persuading the French to agree that the prospects of concorde are such that the project should be cancelled at the end of 1969. Concorde is undoubtedly coming under increasing financial scrutiny by the French Government but the funds required for both development and production until June 1970 have been authorised. The French view is that it is too early to appraise the technical and commercial prospects of Concorde and that it will not be until there are some measurements of Mach 2 flights in June 1970 that we will know whether Concorde is likely to be a success or not. If therefore we decided to withdraw at the end of the year, it would be a unilateral decision taken in the face of French opposition.

39. Such a decision would be bound to sour our relations with the French. This would be extremely unfortunate since it would be a time when the Six will be considering our application to join the Common Market and the French are more kindly disposed to our application than they have been in the past. Our reliability as a partner would be seriously called into question. It would also deal a severe blow to the recently agreed technological links with the Six.

40. If we withdrew before the performance of Concorde can be more accurately assessed, there would be other serious consequences:

(i) It would remove the possibility of earning large foreign exchange benefits.

(ii) It would disrupt the great assembly of resources and skills now devoted to the project and would have widespread consequences for the skills, the standing and the morale of the aircraft industry as a whole.

(iii) Cancellation could load to a loss, in the short term of 7,000 - 12,000 jobs in Bristol in BAC and the British Engine Division of Rolls Royce; elsewhere the problems would be on a smaller scale. In terms of industrial organisation, BACs Bristol Division would be unlikely to survive and a drastic reconstruction of the whole firm would be required. In general, equipment sub-contractors would not be badly hit, although a few specialist firms might be.


SECRET

(iv) But this is to underrate the general and long-term effects. We should be giving up the only major advanced technological project in which we have a world load, and inflicting a blow to morale which would have repercussions far beyond the confines of the aircraft industry.

(v) We would face an extremely difficult political situation. The flight tests to date are know to gone extremely well. Following the first flight of the British prototype, there has been a considerable increase of public interest in Concorde. A reputable public opinion poll completed in June showed that three out of five people were in favour of going ahead with Concordo and only one in four was in favour of cancelling it. If we were to withdraw now, the firms would argue that Concordo was demonstrably on the road to success and the balance of technical argument is such that we would not easily refute them. We would be accused of having lost our nerve.

I cannot recommend this course.

Course No. 2

41. Proceeding until June 1970 would involve additional commitments of £25m. on development, £2-3m. on intramural development and £7m. on production. Although we should have some measurements from the Mach 2 flights by June, the present uncertainties about the production aircraft&apos;s performance will not significantly be reduced until the results from the Mach 2 flights have been fully assessed. This will not be before the autumn in of 1970. We also cannot expect any meaningful reaction from airlines until they have assessed Concorde&apos;s performance. I would certainly propose, assuming we continue with the project, to review the position with the French Minister of Transport at the end of June 1970. But we would not, for the reasons explained, be very much clearer about the prospects of Concorde then than we are today. I think therefore, if we decide to continue with the project, we have to recognise that it would be unrealistic to limit our commitments until the end of June 1970.

Course No. 3

42. Proceeding until the end of December 1970 would involve commitments of £50m. on development, £5m. on intramural development and £18m. on production. The advantage of this course of action are;

(i) The assessment of the Mach 2 flights should be available by the autumn of 1970. We should therefore be much clearer about the likely performance of the aircraft.


SECRET

(ii) We should by December 1970 have a clearer indication of the airlines intentions, even though they are unlikely to place orders until the first quarter of 1971.

(iii) If we decided at the end of December 1970 that the prospects were such that we did not feel justified in continuing with the project, we could defend our decision on the grounds that the aircraft had been given every chance to prove itself but all the signs and information coming out of the performance and commercial assessments were so discouraging that we did not feel able to continue with the project.

43. I believe that for these reasons the right course is for us to proceed with the project until the end of December 1970. What I have in mind, subject to the agreement of my colleagues and the advice of the Attorney General, is that, when I meet M. Mondon on 18th December, I should repeat our interpretation of the legal position and try, if possible, to obtain M. Mondon&apos;s agreement to it. When as I am sure he will, M. Mondon rejects our interpretation, I should say that, without prejudice to our interpretation of the position, we are prepared to continue with the project until the end of December 1970, on the understanding that we reviewed the position together at the end of June 1970. If both Governments decided jointly at that stage to proceed further, we would continue until the end of December 1970 when the two Governments should again jointly review the position. In the event of disagreement at the end of December 1970, however, it would then be for each Government to decide for itself what it should do. I would, following my meeting with M. Mondon confirm in writing our position and the basis on which we were prepared to continue. I would also make it clear that our agreement to proceed on this basis was of course without prejudice to our rights in the event of a fundamental change in circumstances.

Recommendation

44. I seek my colleagues agreement to my informing M. Mondon, when I meet him on 18th December, that we are prepared to continue with Concorde until the 31st December 1970 on the basis I have indicated.

confidential annex AC.D.C. 38dated 21st November 1969.CONCORDE DIRECTING committee report TO BRITISH AND FRENCH MINISTERSPROGRESS ON FLIGHT TESTSSince their first flights earlier thi3 year the two prototype aircraft havebetween them completed 150 hours of te3t flying.     Prototype 001 first flewsupersonically on 1st October and has now reached a Mach number of 1.3;   it isexpected to reach 11=1.4 in its present configuration.     The second prototypeshould start flying again early in 1970 and will then extend the flight regimeto 1.1=2.0.2     Progress on flight trials has been particularly good:    the planned milestoneshave been achieved within the expected timescale and the rate of flying has beenremarkable for a new and complex aircraft.3     The handling qualities are very good at subsonic and supersonic speeds andthe behaviour of the aeroplane and its engines is excellent.4     This satisfactory situation has allowed pilots from Air France, B.O.A.C.,Pan Am and T.W.A., representing all the customer airlines, to fly the aircraft.Their reactions were uniformly enthusiastic.     The summary conclusion of theirreport reads:    &quot;the aircraft was pleasant and easy to fly and imposed noexcessive workload on the pilot even in failure conditions&quot;.5     Taking account of flight experience so far there Is good reason to expect that measurements of performance at 11=2 can be made by the end of June 1970 butthe Concorde Directing Committee considers the results from these tests will notbe fully assessed in terms of production aircraft performance before next Autumn.PERFORMANCE6     The Concorde Directing Committee considers that although officials&apos; currentestimate of the payload at entry into service is between 500 lb. and 1,500 lb.less than the estimate of 15,000 lb. reported in March 1^69, improvements to thepropulsion system now under active development by the firm could lead to apayload at entry into service of 16,000 lb. to 17,000 lb.     These improvementscombined with the minor changes in operating conditions and regularity noted inCDC.32 should allow the target payload of 20,000 lb. at entry into service to beachieved.7     The firms are considerably more optimistic in their estimates of payloadthan the Concorde Directing Committee:   their calculations lead to a payload ofthe order of 25,000 lb. at entry into service and although they would accept that even with their assumptions, 20,000 lb. would be a more realistic figure, theywould not accept the Concorde Directing Committee1s estimates.8     The Concorde Directing Committee considers that a significant improvementhi nozzle performance is necessary to assure the target payload   of 25,000 lb.two years after entry into service.     The Concorde Directing Committee hasauthorised the firms to study a new nozzle system which, according to current/official
official estimates would increase the payload by about 5*000 lb.9     No decision on this new nozzle can be taken before mid 1970 but if at thatdate   the technical aspects are satisfactory, the Concorde Directing Committeewould recommend the adoption of this change subject to an examination of the repercussions on cost and programme and including the possibility of introducing the new nozzle on the first production aircraft.     The Concorde DirectingCommittee is not able to provide a valid estimate of the development cost3associated with this redesign before preliminary studies have been completed.10    These assessments of performance are subject to considerable uncertaintieswhich will not be substantially reduced until the results of sustained flighttesting of the prototypes at cruising speed are available and have been assessed;this assessment will not be available until the autumn of 1970.TIMESCALE FOR INTRODUCTION INTO SERVICE11    The Concorde Directing Committee&apos;s view remains that the most likely date for certification is between end 1973 and mid 1974*     They accept that the firms should continue to work to mid 1973 as a target.     These dates assume the firmswill continue to work to production programme 730B.12 The Concorde Directing Committee considers that Concorde now has a lead ofat least five years over its American rival.AIRFIELD NOISE13    Since C.D.C.32 noise measurements have been made on the two prototypeaircraft.     These suggest a marginal decrease (l-2 PNdB) in flyover and lateralnoise, but taking account of the remaining uncertainties, the most likely situationis as follows:Approach noise is likely to be about the same as that of the Boeing 707and DC8 aircraft;Lateral noise will almost certainly be higher than that of existingaircraft - the most likely figure being about 3 PNdB higher;Flyover noise on some days is likely to be 2-3 PNdB above the levelscurrently permitted at London and New York.14   As a result of full-scale tests on preliminary versions of an improvedsilencer the firms consider that noise levels for flyover could be reduced byabout 2 PNdB and for lateral by about 1 PNdB.115   The noise situation on Concorde is still marginal.     However, the Concorde) directing Committee believes that there is a good chance of these improvedI silencers being available for entry into service assuming officials&apos; estimatesI of end 1973/mid 1974.&apos; SONIg BOOM16   The first prototype aircraft has produced a number of sonic booms during,i CONFIDENTIAL /its- 2 -

A series of quantitative and qualitative assess-cients of Concorde1 s boom is due to take place within the next week or two.RUNWAY LOADING17    The modification proposed by the firms to increase the undercarriage trackhas been accepted as a design option.     This modification combined with proposedstrengthening of the runways has led to an improvement in the situation atJ.P.Kennedy airport.     Studies on the runway loading situation at other airportsare continuing in co-operation with the firms.DEVELOPMENT COSTS18    The annual review of development costs from the four firms is not due untilthe end of the year:   this report accordingly presents a revision of officials&apos;estimates only.19    In CDC.32 the Concorde Directing Committee estimated the basic development cost to be  727M (8,971MF) at January 1969 prices including profit.20    The Concorde Directing Committee&apos;s current basic estimate at October 1969prices after talcing account of devaluation of the franc and certain minorprogramme and wage and overhead increases is  719M (9,420MP) inclusive of profit,but the Concorde Directing Committee considers that there is now no prospect of selling the two pre-production aircraft to a civil customer and  8M must be addedfor thi3 reason giving a basic estimate of  727M (9,520MP).21    Converted to January 1966 prices by the method used in earlier reviews thisbasic estimate of  727M (9,520MP) becomes  601M (8,29LMF).22    These estimates do not include any allowance for further increases inoverhead rates at the four firms as a result of postponement of the production programme;    some increase under thi3 head is nevertheless likely.     Neitherdo they include any allowance for the development cost of an substantiallyimproved nozzle.23    As in CDC.32 the current basic estimate contains only such margins as arejudged sufficient to allow for such unplanned work as may normally be expectedto arise in the course of the programme currently envisaged.     The ConcordeDirecting Committee considers that the upper limit of  84IM (lO,319MF) on aJanuary 1969 price basis should remain.     At October 1969 prices this becomes 836M (10,968MF)COMMERCIAL ASPECTS24    The firms&apos; revised estimate (October 1969) of unit selling price is $22Mbased on 150 aircraft and $23M based on 100 aircraft.     The Concorde DirectingCommittee considers that a selling price based on 100 aircraft will be not lessthan $26M at January 1969 prices.25    Even if results from flight trials at M^2.0 can be assessed by the/Autumn
CONFIDENTIAL- 4 -Autumn of 1970? the Concorde Directing Committee considers that the first contracts with the airlines are unlikely to be signed until the first quarter of 1971-26    While the technical uncertainties are diminishing the commercial questions are becoming of increasing significance.     A number of difficult problems, suchas the selling price to be quoted in contractual negotiations will have to besettled between the Concorde Directing Committee and the firms during 1970.   the concorde Directing Committee has therefore instructed the Concorde ManagementBoard to submit within three months a report on these commercial aspects.27    The market for Concorde is being studied separately.PRODUCTION PROGRAMME28   Following the decision of the two Governments to start production, theauthorisations   required until the end of 1969 for the production of aircraft and engines are being given immediately.     Authorisations for materials and manufacture beyond this date will be agreed between the French and british ministers before the end of the year.AECCTfllEHDATIONS OF THE CONDORDE DIRECTING COMMITTEE29   The Concorde Directing Committee wishes to put forward the followingrecommendat ions;(a) Vigorous continuation of the development programme;(b) Contimxation of development effort on the 601 and 621 series engines;(c) Continuation of preliminary studies on revised nozzle designsallowing the achievement of payloads at least equal to the specifiedtargets;(d)Continuation of desiin the noise levels..work on improved silencers giving a decrease

UK/CEFC(69)10 (Summary and conclusions)Summary and conclusions.    In the time available we have not been able to make as detailed a study aswe would wish.   We have, however, attempted to re-assess the calculations madein the last CEPC Report, taking advantage of certain improved techniques of assessment.2.    The French have appeared reluctant to put any effort into the review and ithas not been possible to hold any meetings with them.   The Report thereforerepresents solely the results of the review by UK officials.3.    Concorde is now expected to enter service between the end of 1973 and themiddle of 1974..   But there is considerable uncertainty whether Concorde will achieve its payload/range performance and whether its airfield noise levels willbe acceptable.   We have assumed for the purposes of this Report that bothconditions will be met.4.    We have taken officials latest estimate of total development cost of 727-836m and of a selling price of ^26m ( 10.8m).   The basic developmentestimate of  727m does not include any allowance for the development of the newnozzle system which is now considered necessary to assure the target payload of25,000 lbs. two years after initial entry into service.5.    We have assumed that Concorde is now likely to be operated as a single classaircraft at standards approaching first class and with a single relatively highfare.6.   With this seating Concorde1s operating costs per seat mile will be about90$ above those of the mixed class Boeing 747, Its main subsonic competitor.   Ifairlines are to buy Concorde they must be convinced that they can offset thishigher cost by higher load factors and higher fares.7.    The later entry into service both of Concorde and of the US SST would, if no other factors had changed, have increased the market (which we have taken upto 1980, as compared with 1975 in the 1967 CEPC Report) by about a half.   Thishowever is more than offset by unfavourable factors such as the higher firstprice of Concorde and its worse operating economics.8.    With Concorde&apos;s present operating economics the prohibition of all overlandsupersonic flying would result in only a small decrease in the market as comparedwith the partial sonic boom restriction case.   In view of this and the hardeningattitude against supersonic overflying we have assessed the market on the basisof a complete ban on all supersonic flying overland.9.    A theoretical market study by the Ministry of Technology suggested a centralestimate of sales of 135 with a possible variation of * 45.   We consider that theway in which this study had been conducted is a substantial improvement on thatundertaken for the CEPC in 1967.   This theoretical study could not however take into account all the factors concerned, but it was useful in helping us to forma practical judgement on the possible sales of Concorde.&apos;0.  We are not convinced of the case for the detailed allowances made in themarket study for what passengers will be prepared to pay for higher speed and foran additional slide-over of tourist class passengers due to Concorde class, meals,service and comfort.
1,   In addition it is necessary to take account of certain other factors whichire likely to depress the market.   These include:(a) airlines&apos; uncertainty about their ability to maintain thehigher load factors necessary to enable Concorde to be operated economically(b) uncertainty about the IATA fare structure for supersonicaircraft(c) airlines&apos; difficulties in financing the massive investmentinvolved, given their existing heavy commitments forsubsonic aircraft(d) airlines&apos; reluctance to purchase any supersonic aircraft and thus the possibility that they may wish to defer theirmajor ordering until the B.2707 becomes available(e) airlines&apos; uncertainty about noise restrictions that might become operative during the period of use of Concorde12. When account is taken of these various factors we consider that sales of concorde are likely to fall within a range of 50-150.   Concorde&apos;s successfulentry into service could lead to airlines placing substantial numbers of orders.But in our view the balance of probability is that sales will fall towards the bottom end of the range rather than towards the top.   Any increase in price above$26m or deterioration in operating economics below target would increase the probability of sales being near the bottom of the range.13.  There is no possibility on our estimates of recovering the  200ra which the uk will have spent on development up to the end of this year.U. *e estimate the discounted losses in resource terras on future expenditure(development and production) as lying between about  50m and  160m, according tothe numbers of aircraft actually sold and the final figure for cost of development.These losses imply a foreign exchange preference of between 10$ and 90$.   Thereis a higher probability that the loss (and the preference) will be towards thehigher end of the range.   Thus although there will be a foreign exchange gain itis likely to be at the expense of an excessive cost in resources.M5.   In addition, it may be necessary to reduce the price below the $2 6m assumed in orderito achieve sales. BOAC may require a subsidy to buy or operate Concorde.   Otherairlines are unlikely to order until BOAC or Air France have done so.   This maywell lead to losses greater than those set out in paragraph 14 above.The Government is also at risk over the losses which would arise if the project had to be cancelled as a result of a technical failure late in thedevelopment programme or in the extreme case of a &quot;Comet&quot; type disaster.   In the, worst case the losses could amount to  600m.j 7. Finally, we would emphasise that overshadowing this market uncertaintyremains the basic uncertainty whether Concorde will achieve its target payload/range performance and whether its airfield noise levels will be acceptable.   We\ understand that the present uncertainties about performance will not bej significantly reduced until the autumn of 1970.P/JKI November, 1969
UK/CEPC(69)lO(Final)REPORT 0? THIS UK CONCORDE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMITTEE1      Officials were asked by M. Mondon and Mr. Benn at their meeting on22nd September 1969 to up-date the report submitted by the Concorde economic prospects Committee (CEPC) in January 1967.   UK Officials had done some preliminary work before the meeting and have continued with their review since then.   The French have, however, appeared reluctant to put any effort into the review.   It has not therefore been possible to hold any meetings with them,although we have sent them for comment a note setting out the changes inassumptions corresponding to the first 25 paragraphs of this report.   No replyhas yet been received.   This report therefore represents solely the results ofthe review by UK officials.   A list of the members of the UK Working Group is at annex A.2      A copy of the summary and conclusions of the 1967 CEPCs report is at annex B.   Since that report, there have been important changes in the estimated in-service date of Concorde and of the American SST, and in the estimateddevelopment costs and selling price of Concorde.   There have also been changesin the assumptions about operating costs, fare structure, load factors, passengerpreference and  supersonic route structure.   An important change in the detailedassumptions concerns fare structure.    Airlines are now tending to think in termsof operating Concorde as a single-class fixed fare aircraft with comfort and amenities approaching subsonic first-class standards with a capacity of about112 seats.3      We examine first the more important changes that have occurred since theCEPC report.   We then indicate in the light of these developments the likelyeffect on the potential market for Concorde and the return to the UK economy.Assessment of technical performance and likely timescaleZ+      In 1967 Concorde was expected to be in service in 1971.   The CEPC, while recognising the risks of unexpected difficulties and delays, considered thatthere was a reasonable chance of Concorde achieving its performance and meeting this timescale.    Officials now expect Concorde to enter service somewhere betweenthe end of 1973 and middle of 197^.   The payload/range performance of Concorde isstill subject to considerable uncertainty.   Officials&apos; current estimates are that   allowing for certain improvements in the propulsion system now being developed, could lead to a payload on entry into service of 16/17,000 lb.   the target figure of 20,000 lb. on entry into service would still be achieved ifminor changes in operating procedures and airline regularity, which should benegotiable with the airlines, are accepted.    In order to assure the target of25,000 lbs. two years after entry into service, a new engine nozzle system isnecessary.   The costs of this cannot yet be quantified but would be substantial.They would be additional to the basic estimate of  727M (see paragraph 12 below).5      Officials&apos; estimate of payload on entry into service is itself subject toa margin of uncertainty of the order of   8,000 lb.   Officials&apos; estimates thu3cover a bracket which at its higher end would lead to the conclusion thatConcorde will be technically successful but which at its lower end would mean that Concorde was a technical failure.   The margin of uncertainty in these estimates cannot be substantially reduced until the results of sustained flighttesting of the prototyDes at cruising speed are available and have been assessed.This will not be before June 1970 at the earliest and more likely in the autumn of 1970.
5     Engine noise at entry into service is also a serious cause for concern.Lateral noise at take-off will almost certainly be higher than that of existingairliners and flyover noise on some hot days is likely to be about 2 to 3 PNdBabove the levels currently permitted at New York or London.   It is considered,however, that there is a good chance of improved silencers being available atentry into service which would reduce the noise levels for flyover by about PNdB.   With., however, the introduction through the 1970&apos;s of quieter subsonictypes, permitted airport noise levels are likely to be lowered, not raised.   Wehave assumed that Concords will not be prevented from operating economically atkey airports on noise grounds, but this cannot be assured.7     We have assumed for the purposes of this report and the estimates of themarket in it that the target payload/range will be achieved, and that airfieldnoise levels will be acceptable.   The conclusions of our report rest on thisbasic condition being fulfilled.8     The effect of any shortfall in performance would depend on the extent towhich the target payload was not met.   A minor shortfall might be made acceptable to the airlines, and thus not significantly affect sales.   But any major short-fall in the target payload would quickly reduce the aircraft&apos;s economic prospectsto the point at which it would become unsaleable.American and Russian competition9     At the time of the CEPC report, the Americans were expected to have an SSTin service towards the middle of 1974-   The Boeing swing-wing design, however,ran into difficulty and had to be abandoned.   Boeing subsequently submitted a fixed-wing design (the Boeing 2707) to the Federal Aviation Agency.    Although itis understood that the interdepartmental Committee set up to review this programmerecommended against proceeding with the aircraft, President Nixon announced inSeptember 1969 that, subject to the necessary appropriations being granted by congress, the US Administration would go ahead with the project.   The Boeing 2707is being designed to fly at Mach 2.7 compared with Concorde&apos;s Mach 2 and to carry250 passengers as against Concorde&apos;s 128 in mixed class or 112 in a single classconfiguration.   The DS Administrations stated aim is to have prototypes flying in 1972 with the aircraft coming into service in 1978, but we would consider these dates optimistic by 1-2 years.10    Concorde at present thus has a lead of at least four years over the Boeing2707.   By the time the Boeing comes into service there should be enough traffic to support both aircraft with Concorde being gradually switched to other routeswhen the Boeing comes in on the Atlantic routes.   In this respect the Boeing canbe considered as complementary rather than a rival to Concorde.   The shadow effectof the American SST and the availability of airline finance could, however,depress sales below the theoretical market demand (we return to this point inpara35 below).     Airlines might decide to buy only a few Concordes to gain SSTexperience but defer their major ordering until the Boeing SST comes into service.On the other hand, the American recognition of the advent of SST operation could,given Concorde&apos;s lead, stimulate the demand for Concorde by airlines wanting toestablish themselves in this new field from the beginning.   It would, however, inour view be unwise to count on any significant number of Concorde sales afterthe American aircraft has come into service - say after 1980.I&quot;1    The Russian SST (the Tupolev U() is slightly ahead of Concorde and theRussians claim that it will enter airline service in 1972.   The Russians havehitherto been relatively ineffective competitors in the field of civil airlinersExcept in the Eastern Bloc, which we have excluded from our estimates) and it isdoubtful whether the TU 1^4 will provide much competition to Concorde outside this area.   It might, however, secure some sales outside America and Europe,particularly if the Russians are prepared to offer it at a cut price. . ^-2 -..
K^estimated development costs12    The earlier CEPC report drew attention to the possibility that the thenestimated development cost of  500M at January 1966 prices, though already anincrease from the original figure of  135M, might even at that time be too low,and that an increase of say 10 to 20$ might not be out of the question.   Thelatest estimate on a January 1966 price basis is  600M excluding any overallcontingency.   In October 1969 prices the latest estimate, excluding contingencyis  727M.   This estimate also does not make any allowance for the cost, whichwould be substantial, of the new engine nozzle system discussed in paragraph above.   When the contingency of  109M allowed by officials has been added, thisproduces a bracket of  727-836M.   Of the basic estimate of  727M,  330M remains to be spent, of which  150M would fall on the UK.   It has been assumed that the contingency, if it is called on, would fall equally on both sides.   If the fullcontingency were used, this would raise the outstanding share of the cost to the uk to  205M.Estimated selling price13    In 1967 officials considered that, with no levy for research and development,the average unit cost of production for a run of 100 aircraft at a rate of threea month would be about  6.5M.   It is understood that officials are now recommend-ing that the selling price for a similar production run but including a sliding scale of levy of 4.-10$ will not be less than $26M (i.e.  10.8M).   The calculationsand conclusions in this paper are based on the figure of $26M.   It should be notedhowever, that this will not necessarily be the actual selling price, since thiswill depend on the sales policy that still has to be agreed.Operating costs14    In the GEPC report, account was taken of competition from the Boeing 707.This will no longer be the main subsonic competitor given the delay in the date of concorde&apos;s coming into service.   The 707 will by 1974 have given ground to the boeing 747.   We have therefore taken the Boeing 74Vs operating costs as thedatum for comparison with Concorde.   Allowing for the fact that Concorde will carry less freight, and assuming it has 112 seats, its operating costs per seat-mile will in effect be about 90$ above that of the 747, assuming 367 mixed classseats at a mean range of 4*000 kilometers and a Concorde price of ^26M.   Ifairlines are to buy Concorde, they must be convinced that they can offset thishigher cost by charging a correspondingly higher fare for each seat, or by a combination of filling a higher proportion of its seats and charging an appropriatehigher fare.- load factors15    The CEFC considered that Concorde should, particularly in its early yearswhen relatively few are in service and it has no American SST competitor, be ableto operate with a high load factor.   We do not dissent from this view.   Since,however, Concorde will now be entering service later when traffic will haveincreased, load factors generally may be higher than those previously used.   Thiswould suggest average load factors over a ten year life of perhaps 68$ (supersonic)and 55% [subsonic) instead of 65$ and 52.5$ in the earlier study, with the sameratio of supersonic to subsonic load factors.   The assumption of a higher loadfactor for Concorde compared with the Boeing 747 stems partly from its smallercapacity, partly from the fact that the traffic it will attract will be much lessseasonal in character, and partly from the fact that during the early years of operation there will not be enough Concordes in service to meet the estimatedpassenger demand.   But we recognise that the assumption about load factors is ofcrucial importance to the assessment and must be uncertain./Sucersonic
Supersonic fare surcharge.16     In the GEPC assessment the required Concorde fare surcharge was calculated on a fairly simple approach in terms of the ratios of Concorde to subsonic seat-mile operating costs and load factors, with an allowance for subsonic freight.In assessing the relative seat-mile operating costs, comparable seating standardswere assumed, e.g. mixed class or all tourist class, in both Concorde andsubsonic aircraft.17    This approach assumed that the Concorde fare structure and associatedamenities would be essentially similar to those on subsonic aircraft, thedifference being a constant percentage surcharge for Concorde passengers in each class.   It implied that the proportion of passengers choosing Concorde in eachfare class would be roughly the same, so that the constant percentage surchargepaid by each Concorde passenger over what he would have paid if Concorde had notbeen available gave a direct measure of the ratio of Concorde to subsonic averagerevenue per passenger.18    The simplified approach is no longer considered valid, particularly at thelevel of fare surcharge which now seems to be necessary.   It is unrealistic to expect that the significant and growing proportion of passengers who travel onsubsonic aircraft at low promotional fares will transfer to Concorde to the same extent as the normal tourist and first class passengers.   The manufacturers andsome airlines, including Pan Am, are now thinking in terms of Concorde beingoperated as a single class aircraft with standards of comfort and serviceapproaching first class levels (e.g. 110/112 seats instead of 128/132 touristseats as used before) and a single relatively high fare, taking all the first class passengers from subsonic aircraft operating on the same routes togetherwith a proportion of tourist and other passengers.   We believe that this is alikely outcome.19    In this type of operation, the subsonic aircraft on Concorde routes will loseits first class passengers and a proportion of the higher fare tourist passenger.The average revenue per passenger which the subsonic aircraft might otherwise have earned in the absence of Concorde will be decreased.   This will be largely offset by the increased seating capacity and reduced catering costs consequent on the deletion of the first class compartment, but a small net loss will remain.   Thisresidual loss on the subsonic aircraft will have to be compensated by pitchingthe Concorde fare at a level such that the return on investment for the fleet asa whole will be the same as would have been achieved by subsonic aircraft in theabsence of Concorde.Passenger preference20    Concorde&apos;s load factor and hence fare will depend on the percentage of passengers who will wish to travel by Concorde, i.e. the 1 supersonic slide-over&apos;.Factors in their choice will be:a) the time saving offered by Concorde compared with subsonic aircraftb) the higher fare on Concordec) the value which individual passengers set on savings in their journeytimesd) any other attractions of Concorde such as comfort (e.g. ^-abreastseating and, in the case of the proposed special single class Concorde,seat pitch and catering standards approaching first class levels) andgeneral psychological attractions./In- u -
In considering these factors, allowance should of course be made for the effects of sonic bang restrictions and any additional stops for refuelling on the timesaved and on the operating cost.21 The CEPC, in establishing the passenger preference factor in its earlierassessment, took a formula suggested by the US Department of Defence, namely:Supersonic passengers        i x time saving/mean journey timeSubsonic passengers Fare surcharge/mean fareIt was recognised that this formula was of doubtful validity, but it, was the bestapproach available at that time.   It is open to the criticism that it is basedlargely on American experience and therefore reflects largely American income levels and valuations of time saving, which will not be typical of other regions of the world, and also that it is derived from oast experience which covers onlyrelatively small changes in journey times and costs.    It gives somewhat implausibleresults at high levels of fare surcharge; a significant demand continues even at very large surcharges whereas in practice demand would be expected to becomenegligible beyond some point.22    .\&apos;e believe that a better approach to passenger preference is to assume thatpassengers are prepared to pay a certain proportion of their family earnings inorder to save a certain amount of time in absolute terms, the so-called &quot;timevaluation&apos; approach.   This would be expected to give different answers for business and leisure time.   The time valuation approach is also not whollysatisfactory.    It is attempting to forecast sociological trends and motivationsin a relatively unknown area some years ahead.   There is therefore a large areaof uncertainty.Sonic bang23    In the last CEPC report, an attempt was made to assess the effects onConcorde1 s market of sonic bang restrictions.   Two cases were considered:a) a complete ban on all supersonic flying over landb) a partial ban, with no transition bang overland and no supersonic, flying over Land with a population density greater than 16 personsper square mile.Since the CEPC last reported, there has been a hardening of attitudes againstsupersonic overflying.   The Federal German Government has indicated that it willnot permit supersonic flying over populated areas.   The US Secretary of transportation issued a statement recently that supersonic flying will be prohibited over copulated areas at least until the sonic bang problem has been1 solved1 .   Every supersonic aircraft will produce a bang.    (The intensity of thebang depends on the weight and shape of the aircraft, on meteorological conditions and the speed and height at which it is flying.   There is therefore no technicalsolution to the sonic bang).   As in the previous CEPC assessment, we think it right to assume a ban on supersonic flight on overland US domestic routes.    fig growth24 Since the last assessment, traffic growth rates have been slightly revisedupwards. Estimates have been made region by region in relation to past trends.In global terms, the current forecasts correspond to the following:-   tL,5
	1966-	-1975	1975	-1980	Traffic Ratio	Mean Growth rate p.a.	Traffic Rstio	Mean Growth rate p.a.Routes over 2500 nm	2.9	12^6	1 .55	9*1500-2500 nm	2.8	12-36	1.5	750-1500 nm	2.55	11.?	1.45	These figures are in general accord with the consensus of views heldby the various authorities.Potential concorde routes25    In the previous CEPC assessment Concorde was assumed to be oprated only onroutes on which the longest sector fell within the range of 1250-3250 nauticalmiles.   Discussions with operators have since shown that Concorde is likely to beooerated on longer sectors than this (with an additional fuelling stop) and alsoshorter sectors  (as a fill-in, to maximise revenue) possibly down to 750 nms.Such stage lengths would however lead to an increase of seat-mile operating costs and this increase would lead to off-setting increases in the&apos; surcharge requiredwhile on the shorter routes there would then be only a small saving in time.Nature of present study26    In the time available it has not been possible to carry out a full study ofthe market potential for Concorde.    We have, however, attempted to re-assess the calculations made in the last CSPC report in the light of the factors discussedabove.   At the same time advantage has been taken of the opportunity to improve the techniques of assessment.   The   Ministry of Technology have carried out forus a theoretical assessment of the market on t&apos;&quot;i:s basis, and the results of this are given at Annex C.   We have not been able to examine the assumptions on whichthis study is based, many of which are necessarily uncertain, in the detail wewould wish.27    Although this study has attempted to build up the market on a logical basis on certain stated assumptions, it had, of necessity, to adopt a theoreticalapproach that could not take into account all the factors concerned.   Thus, while we consider that the market study is a substantial advance on that undertaken forthe CSPC in 1967, and is useful in helping us to form a judgement on the possiblesales of Concorde, we do not consider that it would be right to attach too muchweight to the precise figures   produced by the study.    In particular, theCommittee is not convinced of the strength of the case for certain numericalfactors included in the assessment, and these are discussed further below.Moreover, the study inevitably takes no account of such factors as the availability of finance and other constraints on airlines, such as uncertainty about IATA farestructure, Government attitudes to noise.   The following paragraphs therefore  setout firstly the broad conclusions of the theoretical study on the likely market,and secondly the qualifications and the modifications we think it necessary tomake to them./28. 6 -
23    The 1967 C3PC report estimated, on the assumption of partial sonic boomrestrictions, a potential market for 162 Concordes up to 1975 but, considered thatin view of all the uncertainties the possible range of sales up to 1975 was from80 to 180 with a central estimate of 130.   The CEPC warned, however, that therewas a higher ch nice that total sales would be either relatively small orrelatively large than that they would fall somewhere near the middle of the range.The main changes29    Since Concorde is not now expected to enter service until 1974, and the US33T Until 1980, we have taken as the datum year for Concorde*s markt 1980 ascompared with 1975 in the CSFC report.    If no other factors had changed and inparticular if Concorde&apos;s costs had remained the same, the growth of trafficdaring this period would have increased the market for Concorde by something over100 aircraft.    This favourable factor is however more than offset by unfavourablefactors working in the opposite direction.   The initial price of the Concorde isnow higher.   Its operating economics are worse and the seating capacity issmaller (on the assumption that Concorde is now likely to be offered as a singleclass aircraft only).   We also consider that the extra price a passenger would pay for the higher speed was somewhat overstated in the last report.30    In the last CEPC report it was considered that the effect of a completeprohibition on all overland supersonic flying, as opposed to partial sonic boomrestrictions, would be to reduce the market for Concorde by some AO aircraft.    Ourpresent market study suggests that with the worse operating costs of Concorde nowassumed, its use would be heavily concentrated on the high density trans-oceanroutes (where the traffic density would be still higher than assumed in our lastreport owing to the later date we are now taking).    As a result, the prohibitionof all overland supersonic flying would result in only a small decrease in themarket as compared with the partial sonic boom restriction case.   This would notbe the case if Concorde1s operating economics were better.   Moreover, after 1980,assuming the Boeing 2707 has entered service by then, Concorde will need to beswitched to less dense routes and a complete ban on overland supersonic flyingwould make it more difficult for Concorde to be operated profitably on these routes.   The extent of the possible sonic boom restrictions may therefore stillbe a significant factor in an airline&apos;s decision whether or not to buy Concorde.In the light of the above factors and because of the hardening attitude againstsupersonic overflying (see paragraph   23 above) we consider that the market shouldbe assessed on the basis of a complete ban on all supersonic flying overland.31    When account is taken of these and other factors, the theoretical marketstudy summarised in Annex C indicates that at a price of /526m, there should be a potential market for 135 sales up to 1980.   The uncertainty in this arithmeticalcalculation is put at * 45.   At  28m, the estimate comes out at 125 i 40; and at- 332m, at 100 * 30.    As already indicated however, we regard these figures as requiring heavy qualification -and as providing only the starting point for ajudgement on the broader factors.Hojifiiigtions to, theoretical study32    The Committee is dubious about the allowance made in the theoretical studyfor in additional slide-over of tourist class passengers due to Concorde classoeals, service and comfort.   We feel that although there may be some such effect,there may also be factors working in the reverse direction.   The spaciousness andthe abilitv to move around in the 747 may itself be an attraction.    We therefore consider that it would be better to regard this as one of the uncertain factorsthat might push the demand in either direction.   We also consider that the &quot;valueof time&apos;&apos; method of approach to the amount that passengers are prepared to pay fhigher speed, is better than the Department of Defence method adopted last time/The- 7 -or
The estimate made should therefore represent the centre of an uncertain range -and there are necessarily uncertainties about the value of time approach.   these factors should in our view therefore lead to some writing down of the figures given in Annex C.33    The calculations in Annex C assume that the surcharge on Concorde fares willbe route by route, according to the traffic conditions and relative costs of concorde.   This surcharge varies widely between routes but an average value wouldbe about 50% on the standard low season subsonic economy fare.    (The present first class surcharge also varies widely, the average for BOAC routes being about 15%)&apos;This is necessarily an unrealistic assumption.   Some more simplified approach islikely to be adopted and the actual agreements reached under IATA on surchargemagnitude may well be somewhat less favourable to the operation of Concorde.   this could therefore also lead to some reduction in the market.   On the other hand,airlines might adopt a different approach.   For instance, they might charge fullfirst class fares for normal flights in Concorde but keep up the load factor by offering promotional fares at certain off-peak periods.   This might result in a slightly more favourable outcome than we have assumed.34.    Among the more general factors which could seriously depress the market forConcorde are uncertainty on the part of the airlines whether Concorde will be ableto achieve the high load factor necessary to enable it to operate economically,uncertainty about what fare structure IATA will fix for supersonic aircraft, the financing problems of airlines, the competition of the Boeing 2707 and possibly also of the Russian TU 144, and uncertainty about the restrictions governments might seek to impose on supersonic transports.   We consider each of these problems in turn.35    Airlines will be cautious about committing themselves to buy Concorde unless they can see a satisfactory return on the heavy investment involved.   They willhave to be convinced that they can offset Concorde&apos;s higher operating costs (atpresent estimated about 90$ higher per seat-mile than those of the 747 as defined in para 1 4) by filling a higher proportion of its seats as well as a higher charge for each seat than the 747.   Any improvements to the 747 would make the costcomparison even more unfavourable to Concorde, and it is quite possible that a747 in stretched form will be an offer to the airlines by the time Concorde isentering service.   The market study has assumed an average load factor over10 years of 68$ for Concorde as against 55$ for subsonic aircraft.    Airlines may go slow in ordering Concorde because of doubts whether in fact they will be ableto retain sufficiently high load factors for Concorde, particularly when thelarger US SST comes into service a few years later.36   A critical factor in the decision of airlines of whether or not to buyConcorde is likely to be the availability of finance.   Airlines throughout the-world are at present faced with a massive investment problem to finance their purchases of Airbuses, Jumbo Jets and SST&apos;s.   In 1968, IATA member airlines had more than 1000 subsonic and supersonic aircraft on order, representing a total value of around $15,500m, which is more than the total value of the existingfleets ($14,500m for 2,460 aircraft).   Each airline contemplating a purchase ofConcordes will have regard primarily to its own financial situation, includingits current profitability, the extent of its financial commitments, and the way in which the purchase would affect it3 profitability.   It is possible that in sucha situation an airline might.decide to defer purchase of supersonic transports andto concentrate its activities for the time being on squeezing as much profit aspossible from its subsonic fleet.   Alternatively, and more probably, the decision0j- an airline already heavily committed to subsonic aircraft might be to purchasea smaller number of Concordes than it would have if its commitments in respect ofsubsonic aircraft had been smaller.   On the other hand, it is arguable that if one- 8 - /or
or two leading airlines purchase.se a substantial number of Concordes otherairlines will be under pressure to purchase Concordes also whatever their financial position.   On balance, however, we believe the critical financialposition of airlines is more likely to depress the market for Concorde.37    There is little doubt that airlines would like to put off purchasing SST&apos;sas long as possible.   They might well in these circumstances, particularly ifthey are short of finance, decide to buy only a limited number of Concordes anddefer their major 3ST ordering until the bigger and faster Boeing 2707 becomes available, although there is no evidence th^t Boeing&apos;s operating economics willbe any better than those of Concorde.   On the other hand airlines may want toestablish themselves in the 3ST field as soon as possible and this couldstimulate the demand for Concorde.   On balance, however, we believe that the shadow of the Boeing 2707 will depress Concorde sales.   It is also possible thatsome sales might be lost to the Russian TU38    The remaining factor which could reduce Concorde sales is uncertainty on thepart of the airlines about the amount of engine noise which the authorities invarious countries will tolerate and the likely extent of sonic boom restrictions.Airlines will have to assess their investment over at least a 10 year life andthey may well be concerned that in the course of this time noise regulations inparticular could be introduced which would have an adverse effect on their SSToperations.39       There can be no certainty about the weight the various airlines are likelyto give to the consiieration3 discussed above.    A note at Annex 0 does howeverset out what is known about boac&apos;s and other airlines&apos; attitude and the picturethat emerges is one that in the main confirms the pessimistic conclusions theCommittee has reached.   The possibility does indeed emerge that if BOAC and AirFrance finally decide to buy Concorde they would only take up about half theiroptions and other airlines might follow suit.The probable market40    When account is taken of all these Uncertainties and of the factors which arelikely to depress the sales of Concorde we consider that, with a price of $26m foran aircraft of the target specification, the numbers of Concordes sold by 1980could fall within a range of 50-150.   There is a higher chance that they will be either relatively small or relatively large than that they will fall somewherenear the middle of this range.   We further consider that the balance ofprobabilities is that sales are more likely to be towards the bottom end of ourrange than towards the top.41    If the price should rise above $26m or should there be any deterioration tooperating economics, this would increase the probability of sales falling towardsthe bottom of the range.42../ We would emphasise that all our estimates assume that the aircraft will achieve its target payload/range and that airfield noise levels will be accept-able.   As already indicated there are considerable uncertainties on both counts.Failure to achieve the target payload range or unacceptable noise levels would reduce the possibility of the sales we have indicated.Financial returns and risks43    Even on our most optimistic market assumptions there is no possibility ofrecovering the  200m which the UK will have spent on development by 31st December,nor of the additional  20/30m to which we are committed.   This amount has- 9 - /been
been irretrievably lost.    In considering the likely return to HMG we take account only of expenditure still to be incurred after 31st December 1969.Developmentu    The latest estimate of the UK share of extramural development expenditure from January 1st 1970 is between  150m (the UK share of the basic estimate) and 205m (the UK share of the basic estimate plus contingency).   To this should beadded intramural and support costs of some  15m, giving a total of  165/220m.Discounted at 10$ to present values and less unavoidable future commitments of 20/3Om this equals  100-150m.45    The sale price of $26m includes provision for R&amp;D levy on a sliding scalefrom 4 to 10$ on aircraft and 10$ on spares.   In terms of development expenditurealone and excluding the sums already spent or committed, the loss on a d.c.f.basis to HMG from the sale of 50, 100 and 150 aircraft would be:  million, discounted to 1969 at 10&amp;I ales 50100      150100Future development costs(less unavoidablecommitments)Revenue from 4-10$ levyLoss118911139100247615024126150100        150406040110Production46    In addition to the sums required for development, the Government will have to advance or guarantee the working capital to bridge the gap between productionexpenditure and receipts from airlines.   Production finance arrangements have yet to be concluded with the firms but it is envisaged that the firms will to aconsiderable extent be indemnified against the risk of losses, particularly in theearly stages of the production programme.   This expenditure as well as thedevelopment expenditure already discussed would also be at risk.47.   The selling price of $26m assumes that education costs are spread over100 aircraft.   To the extent that sales fall short of this figure, there would bea loss to HMG on production additional to the loss on development referred to inparagraph 45-   Against there would be some profits on sales of spares.Overall economic assessment48    We now consider the balance of payments benefits likely to flow from the concorde project, compared with the resource cost of the development and productionof the aircraft, with the aim of calculating the implied preference for foreign exchange involved in continuing with the project.49    The resource cost is taken as future expenditure on development and productionless that part which is imported and is thus not met from domestic resources.   Thebalance of payments benefits are taken as the total receipts arising from sales of the Concorde similarly excluding the import content of the aircraft.   Inaddition, it is assumed for the purposes of our calculation that UK airlines would,they did not buy Concorde, buy imported aircraft to the same value10The/expenditure
Ipenditure on these alternative aircraft is regarded as a balance of paymentsLefit for the purposes of our economic assessment.     The figures for resourcelost (&quot;expenditure&quot;) and balance of payments benefits (&quot;receipts&quot;) are discounted$0 1969 values.     The difference between them is the net loss of domestic re-prces used..Thi3 loss is expressed as a percentage of balance of payments benefitI order  to show the implied preference far foreign exchange.

Moreover development exnenditure is very likelyI I higher than the present basic estimate and hence the losses nearer the top end21 the range in the above table.- 11 -
50. We would also emphasise that these calculations take no account of lossesyhich might arise as a result of a severe technical setback at the time that large sums have been committed to production.     Nor do they take any account of the factthat the early aircraft may deliberately have to be sold at a loss in order to getsales off the ground or the probability that BOAC will argue that they should begiven an operating subsidy if they are to buy and operate Concorde.     We consider these points below.Contingent losses51    If a comparable disaster to the &quot;Comet&quot; disaster occurred at, say, the endof 1975 (i.e. when Concorde had been in service for two years) and we had preparedfor a production run of 100 aircraft, we would face a total loss on development and production of around  575-620m (ignoring the  200m already spent on development).We have no reason to believe that such a disaster is at all likely but we think it right   to point out the magnitude of the sums at risk if it were to occur.52   A lesser but by no means inconsiderable loss would arise if the project were cancelled as a result of technical failure late in the development programme andafter considerable sums had been committee on production.     If for example, Concordewere cancelled in December 1971 then in addition to two years&apos; further development\ expenditure (about  100m) production expenditure of about  75m (including unavoidableI future commitments) would have to be written off, giving a total loss of close on&apos;  200m.    Whilst we consider it unlikely that Concorde would have to be cancelledafter reaching so late a stage in its development, the possibility cannot be excluded.I- Selling of early aircraft at a loss: 53   The early sales will be critical and the manufacturers may in order to get: sales under way have to sell the aircraft at a price which will not be adequate tocover the full cost of manufacture, interest charges and levy.     Sales at less than; the price officials have indicated is necessary to cover all costs and charges; (&amp;6m for 100 aircraft) would increase the loss discussed in para 50 above, unless the lower price itself resulted in a higher level of sales.Ij 3pAC operating subsidyI %   BOAC and Air France are likely to hold the key to Concorde orders in that thetwo main American carriers (PanAm and TWA) are unlikely to order Concordes until they are clear that they are coming into service with either BOAC or Air France.BO/LCs current studies suggest that the operation of Concorde will result in a loss of  1-2m per aircraft per year.     The level of profit or loss denends on thelevel at which Concorde fares will eventually be fixed;   tills is difficult to forecast at the present time.     BOAC consider that studies by an outside consultantsuggesting the possibility of profitable operation are over-optimistic and, if their own assessment is&apos; confirmed, there could be a loss to them of, say,  10m ayear.    The recent orecedent of Government aid for BEA following orders for the1-11/500 and Trident 3B will not have escaped their notice.     There is a strongprobability therefore that they will argue for a subsidy in order to operateConcorde.     Such a subsidy has not been taken into account in calculating the overall economic assessment.Concorde Economic Prospects Committeeiigggfoer 26 1969.- 12 -

Appendix MSummary and conclusions of the reportof the Concorde Economic Prospects Committee 196*7.1.    Although the best possible estimates have been made of development costs and large contingencies included, there is   a risk, inevitable with such atechnically advanced project, that Concorde may not be completed on time (in service in 1971) or within the estimated development expenditure  500M (7000MF).2. In addition to the development expenditure, some  150-220M (2000-3O00MF),probably covered in great part by aid from the State, will have to be invested in production. This investment is exposed to substantial risks, and even moremight be lost if there were a major technical setback.3,    The expected costs performance and date of introduction of the US supersonic transport (US SST) are of crucial importance in the assessment of the commercial prospects of Concorde.   If the US SST programme achieves its present objectives(including entry into service in 1974/75) it may not only capture the greaterpart of the total SST market after 1975, but also affect the sales of Concordebefore that date.   Present evidence suggests that the date and performanceobjectives of the US SST will not both be met, but it would be optimistic toassume that the Americans will not be able to overcome at least some of thedifficulties now foreseen.4. If Concorde enters service later than now planned, the gap before the US SSTcomes into service may be shortened and the market for Concorde thus reduced.5.    tie do not consider Russian competition to be a likely threat, because oftheir poor commercial performance in selling aircraft.6.    Engine noise in and around airports is still a cause for concern, as it maybe difficult to reduce it to the level required by future noise regulations, thuslimiting Concorde&apos;s use.   The development programme designed to reduce the noiseis important and should be pursued vigorously.7.    Much more important, the sonic bang will restrict the market.   We have estimated that restriction of supersonic flight to sparsely-populated territory(the most likely restriction) would reduce the marked to about 75$ of what itmight be if there were no sonic bang restrictions at all.   A complete ban onsupersonic flight over land would reduce the market to 55%-60%.-8.    Concorde&apos;s operating cost per seat-mile is estimated to be about A0% more; than that of the average subsonic jet which will be operating at the same time.It should be possible to offset this by a fare surcharge of about 15% and al higher load factor (proportion of seats filled) averaging 65% over Concorde&apos;sI life (compared with 52.5% for the subsonic jets).I&quot;.    Our own central estimate of the sales of Concorde is 130 up,to 1975 (ofl which about 50 would be purchased by North American operators).   But our calcula-Stions show a probable range of 80 to .180 (i.e., only a 50% chance that actualI sales will be within this range).   This means that any assessment made today i3! merely an assessment of probabilities and that the project is of necessity a; gamble, depending not only on our ability to develop a technically satisfactoryi aircraft, but also on factors beyond our control.
10.   The total market for SST&apos;s between 1976 and 1980 might be equivalent toabout 80 Concordes, but the number of Concordes sold will depend on the relativeeconomics of Concorde and the US SST.   It would not be safe to rely on a large volume of sales of Concorde in this period.11.   Important decisions will need to be made soon regarding the monthly rate ofproduction and the time by which this rate is to be achieved.   A balance has tobe struck between starting too early (which would entail costly modifications tothe aircraft during or after production in the light of experience gained in development) and delaying the start (which would entail a higher monthly rateconcentrated over a shorter period if the market were still to be caught, andwhich x^ould be expensive).   We feel, however, that whatever the precise timing,production should be on a scale adequate to meet the expected market by 1975.12.   It will be necessary in due course for the two Governments to decide on thepolicy to be adopted with regard to the levy.   This will depend on whether they wish to maximise the financial return on their investment, or rather to maximisethe number of aircraft sold.13.   In financial terms, the prospect of any positive return on the total investment in development and production appears remote, and a large loss likely.It is doubtful whether more than, say, one third of the  500M (7O00MF) in development costs can be recovered, without allowing for any interest on this sum.The public money to be invested in production will also be at risk.I4.  However some weight should be put on the fact that, whereas most of theexpenditure is in British or French currencies, the earnings will mostly be inforeign exchange (though often after a delay, because of the need to allow credit to some customer airlines).   These foreign exchange earnings or savings might amount to some  1 ,70014 (23,500MF).15.  The future load which Concorde will place on the British and French aircraft industry represents about 15$ and about 30$ respectively of their present strength.   It is the only remaining long-haul airliner project in Europe and its future is important for the maintenance of European progress in advanced aircrafttechnology.16.  Given the market uncertainty and taking into account the magnitude of thegamble, Concorde will have the best chance of technical success and substantialsales if the project is pressed forward vigorously and is seen to have the fullbacking of both Governments.G/JK
AppcncJii x CConobrdo Market Assessment1,     This Annex sets out tho assumptions and ronultn of tho market assess-ment performed, for the Committee by the Staff of DAC, Ministry of Technology,during September/October, 1969.   Part I gives a &quot;brief outline of tho method and the main assumptions, and Part II suirimari &amp;&amp;a the results obtained,METHOD AND MAIN ASSUMPTIONSMarket Year and Competition2.     For the present calculations the market is estimated up to 198O, judgedto be the latest year in which the aircraft might be free from directcompetition with the Booing SST.   Wo allowance is made in the centralestimates for any &quot;fore-shadow1 effects of the latter.   The subsonic aircraft operated in competition or in combination with Concorde will vary from amixture of Boeing JO&apos;If , long range trijetrj and Boeing 747s in 1974 to amixture of long range trijets, Boeing 747s and perhaps stretched 747s in thelato 1980s.   The standard Boeing 7471 at the relatively low price at whichinitial aircraft are being offered bo BOAC, has been taken as representativeof average subsoncic seat-mile operating costs for Concorde assessmentpurposes.   Bearing in mind on the one hand that the long-range trijets willhave seafc mile operating costs some 5-10$ higher than those of the B.747 andon the other hand that any stretched 747 would presumably have operating costs lower than the- present version, this is thought to be a reasonableaverage assumption.Concorde Seating and Fare Structure3.     Following the current trend in airline thinking, and in order to simplify the calculations as far as poaaible, Concorde is assumed to havea one class seating layout, with a single * supersonic class&apos; fare betweenany given city pair.   A seating capacity of 112 has been used, allowing aseat pitch of about 37 inches - better than the current tourist-classstandard (34 inches) but not so great as current first-class standards(30 inches upwards depending on the operator and route).   Full first-classmeals and service are assumed for all passengers, with appropriate allowance in the operating cost calculations.Boeing 747 Seating Layouts4.    In the datum all-subsonic fleet with which Concorde or combinedConcorde/subsonic fleets are notionally compared, the B.747 is assumed to be operated in a mixed-class layout with 27 first-class seata and340 tourist-claas seats.   When operated as the subsonic component of a combined Concorde/subsonic fleet the B.747 is assumed to be operated inan all-tourist configuration with 397 seats.Operating Costs5.     Operating costs of the Boeing 747 and Concorde (in the absence ofsonic boom limitations) are calculated according to the agreed Anglo/French formulae and assumptions given in Concorde Management Board PaperNo, 176(a) with adjustments for different standards of meals and service.For the central estimate a Concorde selling price (including levy) of$ 26m is assumed in 1969 money values.   For the B.747 the corresponding1969 price is taken as $17.7m.6.    The operating coots used in the calculations are varied with stagelength and, in the case of Concorde, for the effects of sonic boomlimitations (subsonic legs or diversions to avoid land - below).   Inthe absence of sonic boom effects typical calculated ratios of Concordeto B.747 operating costs at the prices quoted above are:-/Stage
CONFIDENTIAL-2-Stage length (km)Ratio of costs per aircraft-miloRatio of costs per seat-mile(mixed-class B.747)2000 4000 60000.570 0,531 0.5161.67 1.74 1.697,     Two criteria are used for assessment purposes.     In the first the concorde fare on each route, assessed individually, is set such that thereturn on investment in Concorde and its associated spares and ground equipment   is equal to that which would have been achieved by a datumall-subsonic fleet of mixed-class Boeing 747&apos;s carrying the same traffic on that route in the absence of Concorde.    (A return on investment of10^o was assumed for this purpose;   variation of this assumption wouldhave only a second-order effect on the relative Concorde surcharge since it affects both the Concorde and tho subsonic datum fare level).     In thesecond criterion trie Concorde fare is chosen so as to make the return on investment for a mixed fleet of Concordes and tourist-class 8*747*3 equalto that of the datura all-subsonic fleet.     The main calculations have beenmade on the first criterion, the totals then being adjusted for the effect,of the higher Concorde fare needed to meat the second criterion.      in both criteria allowance is included for an assumed loss of nett freightrevenue on Concorde equal to 8?o of total revenue compared with the B.747V8.    A consequence of assessing the Concorde faro individually for eachroute (or group of similar routes), is that the surcharge defined say, asthe percentage increase in Concorde fare over the standard subsoniceconomy fare varies considerably from route to route *      For the purposeof assessing the potential market for Concorde this approach is considered to be the correct one, but it must of course be appreciated that airlinessthrough IATA, may in practice adopt a surcharge policy which results in aconsiderable variation in economic viability from route to route.Load Factors9c    We have no reason to change the ratio of Concorde to subsonic loadfactor which was assumed for the January 1967 CEPC study, i.e* 65*.&apos;32*5oHowever, since we are now considering a market year of 1 9$0 rather than1975 both values have been increased by the same factor so that they become 68:55.     These load factor values are understood as averages forall routes and for the whole year.     The higher figure attributed toConcorde stems from its smaller size, one class layout and because,appealing les3 to non-business passengers, its traffic will be lesssubject to seasonal flucrteaationo than that of the subsonic aircraft.Traffic end. Route Characteristics10.   1966 has been taken as a base year for traffic projections.     Worldtraffic in this year has been broken down first into about 30 major routegroups according to the terminal- areas, (e.g. West Europe to U0S. east coast, West Europe to East Africa etc),,     Each of these major groupshas been split into two categories according to whether or not there isa stage in excess of Concorde10 capability (taken as 6000km), and thenfurther sub-divided into smaller groups distinguished by different meanstage length brackets...     At this point, certain routes have been discarded
as being unsuitable for Concorde, viz.(a) Hout03 mainly over populated areas.     This removes all WestEuropean arid most U.S, domestic routes from further consideration,(b) Routes for which tho mean stage length is below 1250 km, since it has been judged ab in it id in these cases that the operating costs would be too high and the time saving too low for viableoperation11,   Each of the remaining 104 groups has been assessed in detail forConcorde operation allowing, in the case of stage lengths greater than6000 km, for tho additional time and cost of a technical stop to enableConcorde to operate the route in question.       A traffic forecast hasbeen made individually to give 198o traffic on each route group, the overall average growth rate for 1966-80 being 11^ p.ac Also foreach route group, estimates have been made of the passenger breakdownby country of residence and purpose of travel, and the number of stagesflown by a typical passenger,,Sonic Boom Restrictions12.   Restriction (a) of para. 10 has already removed most of the boom-sensitive routes.     On the remaining routes two sonic boom criteria areapplied, namely a partial overland boom restriction avoiding supersonicflying over land areas with population in excess of 16 per square mile,and a full overland boom restriction avoiding supersonic flying over allland areas apart from a section of the North Canadian Polar route which lies within the Arctic Circle (on this route Alaska, populated Yukon andBaffin Island are overflown subsonically),     rfo estimate the effects onoperating costs and block times of these restrictions the; proportion ofeach of the remaining routes which is affected in the two cases has been assessed, allowing for minor diversions which would enable land to be avoided,,     Baaed on J.C. Floyd&apos;s detailed work on B.O.A.C. routes,generalised relationships are then applied connecting the time and costpenalties with the fraction of the route distance over which supersonicflying is prohibited.     Because of the prior application of condition(a) of para. 10, the difference between the partial boom restriction and full boom restriction cases is relatively small in the present assessment.Estimation of Relative Fares13.   rjhe following table shows the global average values assumed for the1980 passenger breakdown by fare class in the absence of Concorde, andthe 1980 subsonic fare rates by class, relative to the standard economy(or thrift) class levelsClass Relative Proportion of Proportion of-fare rate        business passengers      Total passengersFirst	1.75	o.-i 4	0.075Economy High Season	1,15	0.11	0.075Economy Standard	1.0	0.55	0.55Excursion	0.75	0.20	0.25Croups and I.T.s	0o7	0	0.25These figures are in fact typical of B00cA0Co routes at the present time.14.   From the assumed load factor ratio and the estimated relative operating costs, the ratios of Concorde to B.747 average revenue per passenger requiredto satisfy the return-on-investment criteria of para. 7 can be calculated interms   of Concorde price, mean stage length, and the factor expressing theeffects of sonic boom restrictions and technical ytops on operating costs.
CONFIDENTIAL-4-Corobining those calculations with the route data of paras. 10 and 11 andthe class structure and ft.re rates of para. 1 J gives the ratio of thosingle-class Concorde fare to the B.747 standard economy fare winch mustbe applied on each gi^oup of routes in ordor to satisfy the return-on-investment criteria.15,   The speed slide-over calculation (see below) requires an estimate ofthe cash surcharge paid, considered in relation to incomes.     This hasbeen obtained from the relative fare estimates by using the economy classfare rates which apply currently (1969) on each route.Passenger Preference due to Speed16.   For each route group, an estimate has been made of the journey timesaved by a typical passenger if he chooses Concorde, taking account ofvariations in average stage distance, the number of stages flown by atypical passenger, the effect of boom restrictions on Concorde blocktime and delays due to extra- re-fuelling stops by Concorde where thoseare necessary,,17.   The passenger slide-over to Concorde on account of speed attractionalone has been determined for each route group by aggregating the slide-over fractions in each subsonic fare class (which are different on accountof the subsonic fare variation by class).     It has been presumed thatthere would be no slide-over from Croup and Inclusive-Tour passengers.The basic method for estimating slide-over is by a !value-of-time1hypothesis which presumes that the proportion of passengers with a family income equal to or greater that I is equal to the proportion willing topay KI for unit journey time saving.     In order to determine the constant .K,   jet vs. prop competition during 1959-60 on certain North Atlantic andOS domestic sectors has been studied^ together with longer-tern trends ofthe growth of air travel relative to other mode3 in terms of speed, fares and income levels.     These studies lead to the conclusion that if family income is converted to an hourly basis using 2000 working hours per year,the factors relating apparent valuation of time saving per hour to family income per hour are1.25 for business passengers0.75 for non-businosKJ passengers.It should be noted that those factors relate to frjndly. income becauseinformation on this is available, for example, from Port of New YorkAuthority surveys818o   In order to use these figures to estimate the slide-over due to speedattraction, it has been necessary to make a prediction of the distributionof family income among air travellers in tho market year.     Detailed surveysby the Port of New York Authority have been analysed for this purpose, andit has been concluded that air travellers1 income distribution depends mainly on whether the journey is for business or non-business purposes, and on theaverage income of families generally in the travellers country of residence.A small correction has been applied to account for variations in incomedistributions among the general family populations from one country to anothehi making a forecast for 1980, it has been presumed that incomes generallywill grow, relative to subsonic fares, at yfo p.a,19.   As on alternative to the &apos;value of time&apos; approach, an assessment liasalso been made using a modified version of the American Department of Defense
g/rkformula which was used in the January 1967 study for C.B.P.C.20,   An estimate has boon made for each route group of the additional,slide-over from non-first claon oubsonic panoongora bcicauoa Concorde wouldoffor a higher standard of moaln, service and comfort often at a lowersurcharge than tho currant first class.

Thus,relative to past trends in subsonic first claws attraction it has boonproourood that Concord o* r.i amenity attraction is roughly halved on accountof tho smaller time spent in the aircraft, and halved again to allow,somewhat arbitrarily, for the standard of seating etc. being somewhatbelow the probable 1980 subsonic first-class standard and for an improvementin the subsonic tourist class standard.Concorde Numbers21.   To obtain the gross potential, market, the traffic carried by Concordein each route group has boon convoluted into aircraft numbers lining an output per aircraft appropriate, to the moan otage distance flown and blockspeeds achieved, consistent with values implicit in tho operating eastestimates.     Finally,   a rough estimate has been mad a of tho extent to v/hichthe demand for Concorde might fall short of the gross potential marketbecause the traffic level on some of the routes included doeo not permit anadequate frequency of service.
CONFIDENTIALII     MARKET NUMBERS UP TO I98O(See also Summary Table in para 3*0Variation with Concorde Price22.     For an arbitrary datum case, defined by- full sonic boom restriction- allowance for speed attraction only&quot;value of time&apos; hypothesis for speed attraction- no adjustment for possible effects of low Concorde frequency on some routes- Concorde fare determined by equal returns on investment for Concordeand datum mixed classthe estimated Concorde market up to I98O varies with Concorde priceaa follows:-Concorde price (1969) P-kra         28m        $32mMarket to 1980 161 lk2 Ilk23&apos;i     At the selling price of $26m used for the central estimate inthe main body of the Report, the market under these arbitrary datumconditions is thus 152 aircraft.      The following paragraphs describe thevarious modifications which are required relative to this arbitrary datumin order to arrive at the DAC estimate of the most likely Concorde marketat a selling price of $26m.Sonic Boom Restriction2k.     Adoption of the partial boom criterion instead of the full boomcriterion used in paras 22 and 23 would increaso the estimated market by* aircraft.     Since this is a relatively small addition, and since theInternational climate with regard to sonic booms over populated areasseems if anything to be worsening, no credit is taken for any relaxation in our central estimate:    this will be based on the full boom restrictioncaee.Criterion for Choice of Concorde Fare Level25.     On our theoretical basis of assessment the use of a Concorde faregiving equal ROI for a mixed Concordc/subnonic fleet and an all-subsonicfleet, instead of one giving equal ROI for Concorde and an all-subsonicfleet (as used In the datum case) would result in a reduction in theestimated market of about 20 aircraft.     However, in Floyd&apos;s practicalstudies of BOAC and Pan Am operations no difference was found between these tv/o criteria.     In view of this, and since it is by. no means obviouswhat the choice of criterion ought to bo or will be in practice (it islikely to vary from airline to airline),     the appropriate course seemsto be to split the difference in arriving at a central estimate.     A education of 10 aircraft Is therefore applied to the starting figure in para 23.pJg gorde Amenity Attraction26.     Wo have no doubt that the first-class standards of meals and service and. tho higher seat pitch proposed for a oinglo-class Concorde comcompared with normal tourist standards will cause an additional slide-overto Concorde from tourist-cloas passengers.CONFIDENTIAL/for.....
26. (continued)for whom the supersonic fare surcharge is marginally too high to justifytransfer to Concorde on the speed attraction alone.     With a factor ofone-half to allow for improved 3.7^7 tourist standards and for Concorde&apos;sseating standards not being fully up to first-class levels, the calculationsindicate an additional amenity slide-over equivalent to a further marketof about 50 aircraft. Taking   a conservative view,    the centralestimate is increased by only half this number, i.e. 15 aircraft or about10% of the total.27.     In the January 1967 assessment for CEPC there was no additionalamenity attraction for Concorde since at that time the aircraft was assumed to be operated in a similar (eg. mixed-class) configuration to its sub-sonic counterparts.     It is worth noting that the additional passengerattraction of 10% which we have used in the central estimate is appreciablyless than boac&apos;s current assessment for North Atlantic operations, whichranges from 15% to 35% depending on Concorde fare level.     The figures maynot be fully comparable (e.g. our assessment is on a world-wide basiswhejseas boac&apos;s is specific to the North Atlantic) but if boac&apos;s assessmentis correct it implies that we have indeed been conservative in halving ourinitial estimate of 30 aircraft.C on c or de1 Frequency28.     The basic market estimates make no allowance for the possibility that on some routes where the potential Concorde traffic is low the frequency of service may be too low to allow viable operation by competing carriers.This limitation is difficult to assess with any confidence on a theoreticalbasis since the oxitcome will be heavily dependent on commercial factors:it can to a certain extent be avoided, as it is at present, by the airlinesgetting together on the routes concerned, either in full pooling arrangementsor in agreements to inter-leave their services eo as to provide an accept-able overall frequency level.29.     It is also difficult to determine in advance what will constitute&amp;n acceptable Concorde frequency level from the passenger&apos;s point of view.Although a frequency of not less than one flight per day would be desirableit is possible that a significant passenger demand for Concorde would stillexist if the frequency were lower than this, dates of travel and of businessmeetings   being chosen with reference to Concorde timetables in order to save journey time and fatigue..50.     Within the central market estimate of about 160 aircraft before anyfrequency cut-off is applied (para Jik below), about 110 aircraft are de-ployed on high-density routes such as the Atlantic, Pacific and US to SouthAmerica and the Caribbean area, leaving about 50 aircraft on the less denseroutes where frequency limitations may arise in varying dogree.     A maximumreduction for possible frequency limitations would thus be about 50 aircraft,but in our view such a figure would be unrealistic, implying that airlinesmake no attempt to satisfy the potential passenger demand for Concordeexcept on high density routes.     This is unlikely to occur:    some, at least of the demand is likely to be met either by airlines acting together fromthe beginning (pooling etc.) or, if this does not happen, by single airlinestaking the commercial risk of deploying limited Concorde flights in thehope of &apos;scooping the pool&apos;.     If they were successful this would lead tothe competitive deployment of Concorde by other airlines, probably giving rise eventually to pooling or inter-leaving arrangements to avoid over-deployment.
Sumaary of Central Assessment3^. The figures suggested by .DAC for central assessment purposes are summarised in the table below for a Concorde selling price (1969) of $26m:Arbitrary datum with full boomrestriction (para 22)Partial boom restrictionCriterion for Concorde fare levelConcorde amenity attractionFrequency limitationSpeed attraction functionCalculated range Used in Centralrelative to datum   estimate0 to * 50 to - 200 to * 3020 to - 500 to + 401520- 10* 15- 30 to - 35* 10Central estimate at ^26m13535.

Aa in the January 196? assessment for the CEP , an attempt has beenmade to quantify the overall uncertainty in the central assessment by corn-fining the component uncertainties on a statistical basis.     The allotmentof uncertainties is a notoriously subjective process and independent assess--uenta were therefore made:    the results obtained were in good agreement,^he uncertainties considered included those already covered by specific/calculation ...Jl.     In an attempt to get 3ome very broad indication of a possiblelower 11 salt for the frequency cut-off, the Concorde routes have been examined to see where the eotiriated Concorde frequency is less than the arbitrary level of one per day; lf.it .is assumed that on these routes noConcordeo will be operated the market is reduced by 20-25 aircraft.32.     It is difficult to judge where to choose within the overall range of 20 to 50 aircraft.     For the reasons discussed in paras 29 and 30 it iethought unlikely, in a commercial as opposed to a theoretical situation,that the answer will be towards the upper end of this bracket, and our judge-ment is that the reduction will be .30-35 aircraft.Method of assessing Concorde Speed Attraction33.     The uncertainty concerning the choice of the passenger preferencefunction expressing the attraction of reduced journey time is represented by a difference (increase) of about 40 aircraft between the datura estimate,using the &quot;value of time&apos; hypothesis, and an alternative estimate using a modified version of the American Department of Defense formula.     The latter,ie currently favoured by Floyd and was used, in its unmodified form,in the january 1967 assessment for the CEPC.     Although the modification to theDOD formula is in the sense of reducing the assumed attraction of speed, i.e.bringing it slightly closer to the &apos;value of time&apos; hypothesis, it is never--theless considered that the answer is likely to lie nearer the latter thanthe former.     For the central estimate a value lying one-quarter of the waybetween the two methods is adopted, i.e. an increase of 10 aircraft relative to the &apos;value of time&apos; hypothesis.
36. (continued)calculation ranges arid listed in para J4* together with the generaluncertainties in the calculation procedures and assumptions as a whole(e.g. traffic growth, operating costs, load factors, US SST foreshadowor stimulus, additional traffic generation due to higher speed, etc).37.     The results suggest that there is a 50&amp; chance of the answerlying within about t 25 aircraft (t l8^%) of the central estimate, i.ebetween 110 aircraft and 160 aircraft.     In terms of the lower limitthis means a 1 in 4 chance of the answer lying below 110 aircraft ata selling price of ,fs26ra.38.     Within tighter confidence limits, there is an &amp;0% chance ofthe answer lying within i 45 aircraft (i: 3%) of the central estimate,i.e; between 90 aircraft and l80 aircraft.     In terms of the lower limthis means a 1 in K) chance of the answer lying below JO aircraft ata selling price of ,co2bm.39-     If the aircraft price or any other factor is varied so as to alter the central estimate from the figure of 135 arrived at in thisassessment, the percentage variations given above (lSj^o, 33%) shouldbe retained, i.e. the variation in aircraft numbers should be sealedpro-rata with the central figure.DAC, Ministry of Technology
CONFIDENTIAL UK EYES ONLYCONCORDE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS COMMITTEEAppendix DAIRLINES1  ATTITUDE TO CONCORDEBOAC   (Note by the Board of Trade)When Aiglo French collaboration on Concorde began, a memorandum of under-standing was negotiated between the Ministry of Aviation and BOAC, which statedthat BOAC would order Concordes not more than six months after first flight ofthe aircraft or other mutually agreed date, provided certain conditions werefulfilled.   One of these was that Concorde must be competitive with subsonicaircraft operating at the time of its introduction.   BOAC hage eight deliverypositions reserved on the production line;    six among the first 18, and two later on.2.    Since that time BOAC, who have entered a highly profitable period, have repeatedly stated their formal position on Concorde, which is that they will buy the aircraft if it comes up to specification and if it genuinely holds out theprospect of profitable operations.   By this they mean, at the very minimum thatthey want an aircraft which will put them in no worse a position than if theywere operating without it.   Like all leading airlines, they will not commit themselves till they have firm performance guarantees and they will wish to bargain over finance.3.    In the course of informal discussion about the Concorde, BOAC have expresseddepressing views about the prospects for profitable operations.   This is not because the Corporation is in any way prejudiced against the aircraft, but becausethe extensive studies which they have done and are continuing to do all appear topoint in the same direction.   Assuming that payload/range and other specificationsare met, BOAC estimate that Concorde&apos;s average seat mile costs are almost doublethose of the 7A7.   BOAC maintain that the amount of genuinely new traffic whichConcorde will attract will be minimal and that, since it will be dependent on existing and projected subsonic traffic flows, the natural supersonic routes willbe among the dense and highly variegated traffic flows.   In BOAC&apos;s network, onlyLondon - New York appears practical.   They have of course, simulated Concordeoperations to Montreal, to Tokyo via Frobisher, and thence to Hong Kong andSydney, to the latter through USA, but in every case either the frequency was insufficient, or the traffic did not exist to give consistently high load factors,or the service was not attractive in terms of time saved.    Indeed BOAC do notbelieve that load factors for Concorde can remain as high as 70$ throughout the life of the aircraft even on the densest routes since supersonic competitionswould tend to increase with time.A-    BOAC admit that much depends on the assumptions of slide-over and faresurcharges.   Last year they estimated that, with six Concordes costingapproximately  11m. each and a fare surcharge of 15$, their profits would drop byabout  10m a year.   Since then, a great deal of work has been done by BOAC, andthey have readily collaborated with Floyd on their study of Concorde operations in a mixed fleet on boac&apos;s network.   BOAC still believe In a mixed layout ofabout 20 seats as first class and 96 as economy (3A&quot; seat pitch).    They maintain that a flat surcharge of 15 to 20$ throughout will give a bigger supersonicmarket.   The Corporation has also carefully studied a one class configuration of112 seats (four abreast at 37&quot; seat pitch).   The problem here is that at a rateof surcharge approaching the present first class premium there would not be enough first class passengers for six Concordes a day to New York (here BOAC areassuming two Pan Am, two TWA, and two BOAC services), while at a   lower surchargeCONFIDENTIAL UK EYES ONLY /which
CONFIDENTIAL UK EY3S ONLYwhich would aim to attract present, economy passengers the benefit would be lostsince it would be tantamount to giving present first class passengers a handsomegift.   Whichever system is used, BOAC have consistently come up with a worseanswer in terms of their overall operations.   Finally BOAC have pointed out thesensitivity of the profitability estimates to Concorde&apos;s price.   This has beenborne out by the Floyd study which showed that if the price of 2^M dollars were raised to 28M dollars profit margins are badly hit.5.    On purely economic grounds therefore BOAC lo not see. a prospect of largenumbers of airline orders for Concorde.   They admit however, that should a strongcompetitor purchase the aircraft for Atlantic operations, then it would be fairlylikely that BOAC would follow suit since there would be a grave danger of the corporations better-class traffic being lost.   BOAC would be less likely to compete supersonically in other markets, such as the Pacific.   Their needs might therefore be for no more than 3 or 4 aircraft.6.    Consistent with their formal position, BOAC have 30 far refused to commit themselves to expenditure forecasts which imply they will buy Concorde unaided.They have in the past suggested that the Government might buy Concordes and leasetham to BOAC;   the recent procedent of aid for 3EA following orders for the bac 1 -11/500 and Trident 3b cannot have escaped their notice, and there is there-fore a strong possibility that they will refuse to operate Concede withoutsubsidy.   For several years past, the Board of Trade has accordingly incorporatedprovision in boac&apos;s investment programme, with the Corporations&apos; knowledge, forprogress payments on Concorde estimated to fall due in the period of the review.This year the practice was repeated though the net addition, totalling 25 million to 1973/4, was relatively small because BOAC estimated that purchase of the concorde would result in a saving of  AOm on new subsonic aircraft during theperiod to 1973/74-7.    BOAC are well aware of possible operational difficulties such as runwaystrength, payload/range and noise characteristics of the aircraft, and they havestressed that they are assuming that all these difficulties will be overcome.    if for any reason it were not possible to use Heathrow and/or J.F. Kennedy airport,for instance, there would be no point in a BOAC purchase.8.    It is the policy of the Board of Trade that, where possible, the cost ofancillnry equipment and expenditure directly resulting from the introduction ofthe new aircraft should be included in investment appraisals.   BOAC have estimate that, depending on the number of aircraft involved, this could add up to about15-30$ to the basic price of Concorde.Other airlines9.    In addition to BOAC and. Air France fourteen airlines, half of them American,hold options on Concorde.   Their attitude to the project is fairly uniform:   theyare unenthusiastic about supersonic operations in general, and about the very heavy investment, which purchase of Concorde would involve in particular;    on thispoint, postponement of Concorde&apos;s in service date has slightly eased the airlinesProblem by giving them more time to absorb the impact of the B.7a7.    From thispoint of view the airlines would probably welcome any further delay in Concorde1sin-service date.   Nevertheless the&apos;world&apos;s airlines as a whole expect to beentering a period of declining profitability and are very concerned thatConcorde&apos;s operating economics may make matters worse.   Noise is naturally afurther cause for concern./OnCONFIDENTIAL UK EY13 ONLY
CONFIDENTIAL UK EYES ONLYOn the other hand all the option holders renewed the original options whichexpii^ed on December 31st 1968, and all accept that supersonic airliners are boundto come some time and that their operation will become important, to any trunkairline&apos;s competitive position.    If therefore Concorde achieves its targetperformance and enters service with BOAC and Air France there is no doubt that,other airlines whose route structure is adapted to Concorde operations will buyit.   This is likely to apply in particular to boac&apos;s and Air France&apos;s mostdirect competitors on the ocean routes such as Pan Am, TWA, Air Canada, Qantas andAir India.G/JKCOMF1 DENT IAL UK EYES ONLY
ANNEX DSeptember, 1969Thank you for your letter of 28th August.I look forward to meeting you in Paris on 22nd September.I very much hope that, after further consideration, you will be able to agreeto ray suggestion that the Concorde t.economic Prospects Committee should be reconvenedand asked to report by the end of November.    There have been a number of importantchanges in the situation since the C.E.P.C. last reported nearly two years ago.I regard it therefore of the greatest importance that we should have in time forour review at the end of the year an up-to-date appraisal of the position.    Wehave already put some work in hand on our side but I would much prefer it if the assessment can be undertaken jointly.We will not, as you say, have for our review in December our results fromriach 2 flights.    But I must nevertheless ask that we have a fullscale review then in accordance with my agreement with your predecessor M. Chamant.The British Government attach great importance to the review of the projectagreed last year during my talks with M. Charnant.    Though we then expected thatthe Mach 2 results would te available we decided on a fixed dated in part becauseexperience had shown how the programme could slip and the costs escalate with no clear point, other than one fixed by us jointly, at which we could really review the position.Paragraph 2(d) of M. Chamant&apos;s letter of 27th September stated specificallythat in the event of the estimated development costs at the end of 1969 being morethan  600,000,000 in January 1966 conditions each of the two Ministers will proposeto their respective Governments an amendment to the protocol of 196-2 allowing each government&apos; to be released from any automatic obligation to continue the projectjointly.    M. Charnant and I agreed that we should place a limit on the commitment of our respective Governments to development expenditure, irrespective of whetherinformation had become available from the trials at M - 2 when the limit was reached.It would not be consistent with the understanding between M. Chamant and myself that our two Governments should decline to accept the proposal that we will submit to them in the circumstances that have arisen.   We accepted M. Chamant&apos;draft of the agreement because he pointed out that as the original Concorde agree-raent was between Governments it was for Governments to amend it.    However,  the essence of our understanding was clear to both of us and it follows that in practical terms the position from the end of this year will be that the commitment/ofMonsieur Raymond MondonFrench Minister of Transport32 Avenue du President KennedypARlS, I6e
of our respective Governments should be limited to what may then be agreed between them following the December review.I greatly look forward to the pleasure of meeting you to discuss this greatproject which so many hopes in Britain and France rest.(3GD.) ANTHONY&quot; WEDGWOOD BENNG/B14C

At the end of 1969* a decision to be taken on the continuation of the project based on commercial prospects:(a) Orders from four major airlines, including at least oneAmerican airline:    project to be continued.(b) No prospect of orders:    project to be terminated.. (c)    Prospect of orders but at the price of modifications to theaircraft involving increased development costs and a further delay in the programme:    Ministers to discuss the continuanceof the project based on a comparison of prospects and increased cost and time scales.(d)   In the event of the estimated development costs at that datebeing more than  600 M (8,300 MF) in January 1966 conditions,each of the two Ministers to propose to their respective governments an amendment to the Memorandum of Understandingcf 1962 permitting each Government to be released from anyautomatic obligation to continue the project jointly.3.     If in the meanwhile the Concorde Directing Committee considers thatthere is no longer any hope of sales or of maintaining the development costsbelow the limit of  600 M (8,300 MF) in January 1966 conditions, it will, ofcourse, report to the Ministers who will then consider the situation but willnot require to be informed step by step of the development of sales prospectsbetween now and the end of 1969&quot;./Text

ANNEX FUK DRAFTDraft report of Working Grpjrrj to theFrench Minister of Transport and theBritish Minister of technology.    We were set up by Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn and M.

Mr. Wedgwood Benn and M. Mondon when they met on22nd September were not able to reach agreement on theinterpretation their respective Governments placed on theexchange of letters between Mr.  Benn and M. Chamant and theeffect this had on their reciprocal obligations under theMemorandum of Understanding.    The deliberations of the working group were governed by the necessity to do nothing to prejudice the different contentions of the two Governments as to theextent to their reciprocal obligations after the end of 1969.3.

Arrangements havebeen made to continue the discussions with a view to producingan agreed report as expeditiously as possible hut it will notce possible to do this before the meeting of Ministers on the18th December.
MFZX GDRAFTCONCORDETHE LEflAL POSITION AT THE END OF 1969Memorandum by the Attorney GeneralMy colleagues will wish to know, first, my views on what thelegal position would be if they decided to withdraw unilaterallyfrom the Concorde project at the end of this year.2,    I last advised the Cabinet on our legal position in amemorandum of 17th March 1969 (c(69)29).   As respects our rightto withdraw unilaterally at the end of this year if theestimated development costs exceed  600m in January 1966conditions, I said that the Benn-Chamant agreement did not interms give us an agreed right of unilateral withdrawal.   Thiswas because the agreement imposed no express obligation on theFrench Government to accept a recommendation by the french minister that there should be an amendment to the Memorandumof Understanding of 1962 releasing   each Government from anyautomatic obligation to continue the project jointly.    I went onto advise that if, however, the French Government refused toaccept such a recommendation, we could withdraw unilaterallywithout running a serious risk of having to pay damages unlessthe Court were to take the view that commercial prospects wererelevant and that those prospects were good, or unless the french had offered us reasonable terms for continuation that we ought tohave accepted.3.    When he met the Minister in September, M. Mondon expressedthe view that, if he were to recommend to the French Government anaoenduent to the lieaorandun of - Understanding of 1 962 releasing- each government from air autonatic obligation to continue, there would beao obligation upon-the French Government.  0 accept it.-. It seems clearthat Mfcigondon will not resilefrom thlo position when he meets theMinister on. 18th December. For... the pflrpoee of this - opinion, I assumetherefore that we will be in the situation envisaged in my memorandum of 17th March referred to above.A.
ll.    In considering whether we could withdraw unilaterally atthe end of the year without running a serious risk of having to pay damages, the first question that arises is whether theInternational Court would take the view that commercial prospects were relevant and that those prospects were good.For the purpose of making an assessment at the present time,I will assume that the Court would take the view that commercial prospects were relevant.   Are those prospects good?5,    The French, according to the Minister&apos;s memorandum, have been reluctant to put any effort into a reassessment of thecommercial prospects of Concorde.    They have taken the line that it is premature to form a view on commercial prospectsuntil Concorde has flown at M.2.    A study of the commercial prospects has however teen carried out &quot;by UK officials (annex to the Minister&apos;s memorandum).    But as he explains in thememorandum, other studies reach different conclusions.    Clearlywe are not yet in a position to assess the commercial future ofthe aircraft in terms of airline orders as envisaged inparagraph 2a of the Benn-Chamant agreement (Annex E to theMinister&apos;s memorandum).    Nor can we say that there is no prospect of orders - paragraph 2b.    If the matter came beforethe International Court, there would inevitably be argument asI to what the commercial prospects were.    If one thing is clear! at the present time it is that the commercial prospects are ati least very uncertain.    This being so it is difficult to see how; the Court could determine them to Toe good.    But if we were now! to withdraw the Court might share the view of the French that weI ought at the very least to have waited for the results of thejM,2 flights when it should he known whether the aircraft willme saleable.6*    Making the &quot;best assessment I can against this background of, imponderables, my conclusion is that the Cabinet need no longerI attach the same weight as hitherto to the consideration thatI bilateral withdrawal might involve us in the payment of damagesI We could hot he sure of success before the International Court,put if the Cabinet decided that on other grounds they wereJ Prepared to withdraw from the project, my advice is that, in/ view
view of the uncertainties and the amount of money still at stake,the Court would &quot;be likely to find in our favour.7,     If the Cabinet decided to withdraw, the second questionmentioned in my memorandum of 17th March might arise.    On our decision being communicated to the French., they might come forward with proposals for continuation.    If we reached this position we would have to consider what we should do at thattime lest refusal might involve us in lialbility to paydamages.8.    My colleagues will further wish to know my views on thequestion whether, if they decided to continue with the develop-ment programme and the currently agreed production programme(730B), this could be done on a &quot;basis that did not prejudice our case that any automatic obligation to continue with the project ends at the end of this year, and that our- commitment for the future would extend only so far as the Cabinet may fromtime to time decide.    I think that this position could besecured.   During the course of his meeting with M. Mondon on18th December the Minister should try if possible to obtainM. Mondon&apos;s agreement that any automatic obligation is at anend.   But, as it is almost certain M, Mondon will not agree,the Minister should make it plain that our continuation with the project is without prejudice to our contention as set out in thefirsjs sentence of this paragraph: he should say that, to make ourposition perfectly clear, he will write to M. Mondon accordingly.My colleagues will understand that by taking this course we wouldnot establish beyond doubt that any automatic obligation was infact at an end.   This we could not do without French agreement.But we would have put it firmly on record, if the matter evercame to Court, that our continuation with the project should notbe taken as an abandonment of our position.Law Officers&apos; Department^ ^JlkgJLs.. 1969.
