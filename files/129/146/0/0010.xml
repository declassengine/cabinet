DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)GMU64 COPY-NO,      fig4fch December, 1969CABINETCONCORDEMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeThere are some important aspects of the Concorde question which fall within my responsibility and it may be useful if I supplement theMinister of Technologyss paper by the following eemmentss-Noiae2,      Concorde will almost certainly be noisier than present aircraft insome respects,,    Other aircraft introduce?! between now and 1974 will haveto meet new and lower noise limits agreed internationally and will be significantly quieter fchan Concorde.    Pressure for abatement of noisenuisance grows year by year and we cannot be certain that public opinionwill regard Concorde noise as tolerable when it is introduced in 1974.    Thisis even more true of the United States than of this country.3.      Even on the ay sumption that the improved noise levels forecast inparagraph 14 of the Minister of Technology^ paper are not exceeded, weshould have to exempt Concorde from the mandatory fly-over noise limitsimposed on operators at Heathrow and this decision, which would, hebitterly resented, would have to be taken before the first quarter of 1971 asa condition precedent to any order from British Overseas airways corporation (BOAC) and Pan American ITodd AlinSfnys (&quot;ir^nAm),    Whetherthe Port of New York Authority (PNYA) will be ready ^similarly to oblige(the restrictions are much the same at J.F, Kennedy Airport) must be amatter of considerable doubt as the PNYA are under no commercialincentive to bend, the rules.    It is to be hoped., as suggested in paragraph 15of the Minister of technology^ paper, that noise will be somewhat reducedby the time Concorde comes into service0    But as stated in paragraph above, quieter conventional aircraft will then be coming into service and itmay be that by 1974 any reduction in Concorde-s noise will be offset by thelower limits on take-off noise both at Heathrow and at the J0F, KennedyAirport,
The sonic boom4.       The paper by the Minister of Technology does not discuss the sonicboom.    The Concorde Economic Prospects Committee (CEPC) Report(paragraph 30) suggests that the prohibition of all oveiland supersonicflying would result in only a small decrease In the market for Concorde ascompared with a situation in which stipersonic flying was allowed oversparsely inhabited territories.    This is because It is assumed that, withits high operating costs,, Concorde would be heavily concentrated on thehigh density, long stage tiansoceanic routes.    I am sure it Is right toassume that supersonic flight over land will be prohibited.    I will submit a paper shortly suggesting,, as did my predecessor in July,, that wc shouldImpose a ban on supersonic ov&amp;HXying of ihe united Kingdom and attswma-sait at the same time as the Order covering test flights is made,BOAC*s present views5.      It is evident that if we go ahead with Concorde and it meetsreasonable performance specifications we must do all we can to ensurethat BOAC operates the aircraft.    As the report by fche United KingdomCEPC shows, Concorde^s operating costs are about 90 per cent above thoseof the 747,    Its operation can only be profitable if both a sizeablesurcharge (up to 50 per cent) on ordinary economy fares is imposed and ahigh average load factor (officials have assumed 68 per cent) Is maintained.BOAC agree that It is possible that, provided the right regime for farescan be negotiated in the International Air Transport Authority (IATA),Concorde taken by itself can be operated without loss on busy routes suchas London-New York.    But boac&apos;s view described in detail in Annex D ofthe CEPC Report, which I have no reason to doubtj, is that this would bedone largely by creaming off traffic from subsonic services and that their operations as a whole would be less profitable if Concorde were used.Their present estimate is that overall they would lose  l- 2 million annuallyon each Concorde.    This view would be reinforced if BOAC had to operatean early mark of the aircraft which was deficient in payload or regularityin service.6.      BOAC are therefore likely to be able to demonstrate that there isno commercial justification for a purchase of Concorde.    They considerthat the studies by an outside consultant, mentioned In paragraph 21 of theMinister of Technologyrs paper, are over-optimistic;, particularly on likelyload factors on routes other than London-New York.    This is mainly because BOAC do not expect enough economy class passengers to be willingto pay a high surcharge on the ordinary fare to enable fche requisite loadfactor to be achieved on these others? routes.    Admittedly it could be argued that BOAC would make a smaller loss by operating Coxxcorde than they wouldincur without it if their rivals, such as PanAms put it into service on      ,important competing routes.    Buts as paragraph 20 of the Minister of technology*s paper states, PanAm and other airlines are unlikely to place orders for Concorde until they are sure that it will be coming Into service with BOAC and Air France.-2-
7,      We have no powers to direct BOAC to purchase Concorde and itwould not be desirable to take powers in the forthcoming Civil Aviation Billto give a specific direction to the Airways Board to do so    We shall therefore have to rely on persuasion.    BOAC will have in mind their own experience over -die purchase of the VC 10 and BEA!s more recent experience over the Trident 3B suftd will certainly ask to be indemnifiedagainst financial loss consequent on their acceding to a Government request60 take Concorde against their commercial judgment,,    If in the&apos;mid&quot;-seventies they are in only a marginally profitable position^       isquite probable given the greatly Increased capacity coming into servicesthis could result in a subsidy which would require legislation^    Even ifBOAC are still making sizeable profits from 1974 onwards,, ^,-hen the concorde is expected to enter serviceg we could not conceal the fact if weassisted them by giving them a lower financial objective and by acceptinga lower, or nils return dividend on their public dividend capital.    Suchdevices would be an obvious disincentive to other potential purchasers.8.       Moreover the recent White Paper on Civil Aviation Policy(paragraph 78) has committed us to the view that any support for thedevelopment of British aircraft should be g?ven directly to the manufacturing industry.    That would seem to me to be the moredefensible line to follow in this case,, but plainly we shall have to act in concert with the French, who must have the same problem with Air France,and I would not seek a decisior on this point now.The Concorde*s commercial prospects .      The CEPC came to the conclusion that sales of Concorde,, provided it comes up to scratch technically s are likely to fall within a range of 50to 150.    Concorde^s successful entry into service could lead to airlinesplacing substantial numbers of orders,, but the Committeess view was thatthe balance of probability is that sales will fall towards the bottom end ofthe range rather than towards the top.    Any increase in the price above$26 million, or deterioration in ojjerating economics below target? would increase the probability of sales being near the bottom of the range.10.      My own view is that even the lower figure of 50 may be too optimistic.    This is because our recent talks with BOAC and theinformation we have about other airlines point to the likelihood that allairlines will be very cautious in their ordering.    It could well bes forinstance, that BOAC will only be prepared to order sufficient aircraft forthe more suitable routes such as New York, which would mean thair takingthree or four aircraft instead of the eight on which they at present haveoptions.    If we were to accept this and other airlines were to follow suit,total sales might well fall below 50.    If this proves right, Concordessprospects as an export are rattier worse than allowed for in the CEPCReport.-3-
Discussions with, the French11.       We must bear In mind the likely consequences for our relations withthe French Government, set out in&quot;the Minister of Technology*s paper, ifwe force cancellation on them now, particularly if they do not accept curestimates of the commercial prospects.    Whether or not they themselvesreally wish to put more money into the project they would no doubt welcome the chance of putfciuig the blame for cancellation on us and we might find our action turned to our disadvantage in Evirope both in connection v/ith our application to join the European. Economic Community and in other waysas well.12,      I am convinced that if Cabinet decides to continue the project for afurther period^ we must as soon as possible confront the French with ourown view of Concorde*s commercial prospects to find out if they agree,and if not why not.    If we are right in thinking these prospects are extremely poor this must be a major fac-or in determining whether the project goes on.    I understand that the Minister of Technology will be giving M. Mondon the CEPC Report.    If possible we should obtain an agreed Anglo-French expert report well before any further joint review which might take place in June, 1970.R.M.Board of Trade8 S..W.1.4th December, 1969
