CONFIDENTIALDRAFTINDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN GOVERNMENT LABORATORIESA NEW ORGANISATION EOR THE SEVENTIESForeword by the Minister of technology the deployment of skilled manpower is one of thecentral political questions of the twentieth century.    Itprofoundly affects the kind of society in which we live.This is a major concern for the Government, because thearrangements which have evolved during the present centuryhave brought under direct Government control a substantial proportion of the scientists, engineers and technologistswho carry out this country1s research and development.This subject is also of profound interest to the public asa whole, whose future will be greatly affected by thedecisions made in this field.2.     Despite heavy national spending on research and develop-ment we have not profited fully from this investment, forour rate of economic growth has been running at a lower level than that of many of our competitors.    TheGovernment has therefore concentrated, in developing itspolicies for research and development over the past fewyears, on measures that will most assist industry toimprove its performance.    Thus the Government has broughtabout a shift from defence research to civil tasks?    wehave reduced the emphasis on the aerospace and nuclearindustries - both having very strong defence associations -in order to release effort in support of a wider range ofindustry;    we have sought to put more emphasis on extra-mural rather than intramural research;    and, finally, muchgreater encouragement has been given to the exploitation of innovation by which the results of research are carried through to full-scale application./3.
3.     This redirection of effort has had importantconsequences for the Government laboratories in theMinistry of Technology and in the United Kingdom atomic energy Authority;    the number of staff they employ hasbeen reduced and their programmes of work largelyreshaped.   Furthermore, the enactment of the atomic energy Authority Bill which is coming before parliament would alter the size and shape of the AEiL considerably,because its production organisations would be &quot;hived-off&quot;into two separate companies - a nuclear fuel company anda radiochemical company.    The Government believes therefore that the time has come to consider a fundamental reorganisation -sation and a further redirection of the research anddevelopment resources of the Ministry of Technology andof the Atomic Energy Authority.4.     This Green Paper outlines a proposal to set up a new corporation, outside the Civil Service, to run civil research and development laboratories of the Atomic energy authority and of the Ministry of Technology under a singlemanagement.    The National Research Development corporation would also be assimilated into this new organisation sothat its expertise in the exploitation of innovation wouldbe brought to bear directly on the new Corporations work.The new Corporation would carry out most of its work for both Government and Industry on a contract basis, to ensurethat its programme reflected the needs of its customersand that the industrial work was carried out in an appropriate environment.5.     The implications of these proposals are considerable,and they raise important issues which merit wide publicdebate before decisions are.taken by the Government.    ThisGreen Paper is published to provide a basis for such a debate.
DRAFT - GREEN PAPERINDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN GOVERNMENT LABORATORIESA NEW ORGANISATION FOR THE SEVENTIESI.      INTRODUCTION;    A PATTERN OF CHANGEGovernment laboratories have become increasingly active in industrial research and development throughout thiscentury, constantly developing and adapting to meet new needs,but always in harmony with a central under-lying theme.    Thiswas expressed in a White Paper (Cmd. 8005) as follows:-&quot;A special need exists at the present time for new machinery and for additional State assistancein order to promote and organise scientific research with a view especially to its applicationto trade and industry ....    If we are to advanceor even maintain our industrial position we must,as a Nation, aim at such a development of scientific and industrial research as will placeus in a position to expand and strengthen our industry and to compete successfully with themost highly organised of our rivals.&quot;2.     This White Paper appeared in 1915;    its publicationfollowed the realisation, soon after the start of the first world War, that the nation had become dependent for manyvital products on manufacturers abroad where science had- often been more effectively applied to manufacturingprocesses.   Even earlier, at the very beginning of thiscentury, the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) had beeninaugurated with Government support, because it had become evident that Great Britain was falling behind othercontinental nations in industrial technology, whereas atthe middle of the 19th century this country had led theworld.   NPL, which developed into one of the greatlaboratories of the world for the determination of standards,/became
became one of the most important components of the Departmentof Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) which was formed in 1916 and was to remain in eeistence as a body separate from the executive departments of Government until its responsibilities were assimilated into the Ministry of technology in 1965.3.     One of DSIR&apos;s early actions was to launch a scheme forco-operative industrial Research Associations  (of which thereare now 43)9 to demonstrate widely the value of appliedscientific research at a time when only enlightened firmsdevoted resources to that end.    Industry now spends in totalmore than  500 million a year on research and development,but its distribution varies enormously between industries.Some 40$ of the net output of the aerospace industry hasbeen devoted to research and development, and about 30$ ofthe net output of the electronics and telecommunicationsindustry, much of it on Government account.    On the otherhand, the figures for mechanical engineering and for ships and marine engineering, for example, are about 3$ and 1.5$respectively.4.     Over the years a number of additional research stations and laboratories working in specific fields were built up within DSIR.    These carried out R&amp;D mostly of an industrialcharacter in the national interest, which could not suitablyor conveniently be carried out by individual industries,their Research Associations,  or within Universities.    Thereare now nine of these Industrial Research Establishments(IRSs) in the Ministry of Technology.5.     These developments took place in parallel with the growth of Government responsibilities for R &amp; D in the defence field,and in particular special arrangements were made to provide foran-extremely rapid increa.se in work on atomic energy.    This/was
was originally carried out in Government establishments,but in 1954 the Atomic Energy Authority was brought into existence because the Government decided that responsibilityfor all atonic energy work, both for defence purposes andfor the increasingly important civil applications, should betransferred to a non-departmental organisation more akin toa large industrial undertaking.    As the industrial uses of atomic energy had become more important, large areas of theR&amp;D activity controlled by the Authority had assumed aprimarily civil nature, and in recognition of the changedcharacter of this nuclear work, ministerial responsibilityfor atomic energy was vested in the Minister of Technologyon 1st January, 1965-6.     The Minister of Technology was also given responsibilityfor the National Research Development Corporation (NKDC)which had been set up in 1949 to develop and exploitinventions mainly resulting from public research, and was later empowered to support research likely to lead to aninvention.7.     In these ways powerful groups of the Government&apos;sR&amp;D resources were brought together in the new Ministry of technology.    Early studies were made of how best to organisethese resources for maximum effect, but it was decided to concentrate first on the reorganisation of the nuclear plant and fuel industries, which had come into existence largelyas a result of the success of the sea&apos;s work.    This reorganisation, achieved with the help of the industrial reorganisation Corporation, resulted in the creation of thetwo design and construction companies which are now seeking to exploit all sea reactor systems at home and abroad, andare progressively taking over from the Authority the design and the later stages of development of commercial reactors.As the final stage in this industrial restructuring,/proposals
proposals are coming before Parliament to establish, the nuclear fuel business of the Authority as a publiclycontrolled company.    As was foreseen, these changes makeit necessary to consider whether the organisation of otherparts of the sea should be modified to secure the most effective use of its resources in conjunction with theGovernment&apos;s own research establishments.8.     Earlier, in 1963, a Committee of Enquiry into theOrganisation of Civil Science (The Trend Committee) had recommended the establishment of a number of research councils and the creation of an Industrial Research andDevelopment Authority.    The Research Councils were set upin 1965, but the inclusion of major parts of DSIR in thenew Ministry of Technology superseded the Committee&apos;proposal for an Industrial Research and development authority.    Since then many activities pioneered by DSIRhave been developed in the Ministry of Technology andintegrated with its executive responsibilities, making them no longer suitable for separation from the Departmentssponsorship activities.    But now that the time has come,  asthe Committee foresaw might happen, for a change in theconstitution of the Atomic Energy Authority,  and now that several years&apos;  experience have been gained in the Ministryof Technology of directing Government R&amp;D towards theneeds of industry, the case for a new form of organisationworking on new ground rules has to be reconsidered.-4-
II.    THE PRESENT SCENEGovernment Laboratories&apos; varied programmes9.     One of the main reasons for setting up the Government&apos;industrial research establishments was to encourage theapplication of science and   research in British industry,and much of their effort has been deployed in support ofindustry generally.    The aim was to disseminate widely theresults of research and information about technologicaldevelopments, rather than to co-operate with individual firms in particular projects on a confidential basis.Advisory services to industry therefore form an essential element of the work of these establishments.    They alsoincorporate many test facilities which are available as a central service to industry and which individual firmscould not afford to set up.10.    Government laboratories have also undertaken large-scale projects which were judged to be beyond the resourcesof individual industrial organisations.    An example of this type of activity is the sea&apos;s responsibility for the develop-ment of civil nuclear technology.11.   Governments themselves have found they increasinglyneed the advice of their own research staff,  for example,  inthe preparation and implementation of legislation, and inmatters which are clearly of national concern, such asroads and fire research, and environmental problems likenoise and pollution in all its aspects.12.   Finally, because the vitality of R &amp; D organisationsdepends on the survey of scientific horizons beyond their immediate programmes of work, these laboratories have alsoundertaken basic research./Recent Trends
Recent Trends13.    Important changes have been superimposed upon this general pattern in the past few years in order to implement the Government&apos;s policies of directing research increasinglytowards the needs of industry and of encouraging industry to exploit the results of such research.    A great deal ofdiscussion has taken place on the need to direct scientificeffort to the industrial purposes it has to serve.    This hasbeen reflected in a new attitude among the scientists,engineers and technicians in the Research and development establishments,  and a great deal has been done to realigntheir programmes;    this realignment must become a moredominant characteristic.14.    If the firms capable of applying new inventions orprocesses develop them in their own laboratories earlyexploitation is obviously more likely;    and the larger units which are a feature of those sectors of British industry which have been recently restructured are obviously betterequipped to undertake the research and development they need and are more likely to appreciate its potentialities.In parallel with this development the Government has there fore sought, wherever it has been appropriate, to change the emphasis from intramural to extramural research.There is,- however,  a limit to this process. There are largenumbers of smaller firms, and even the largest are not always self-sufficient.15. V/ithin the Ministry of Technology&apos;s programmes defence research and Development has been reduced while the emphasisof past programmes on military aerospace and nuclear work isbeing reduced in order to build up support for a wider range of industries. In the civil R &amp; D establishments, despite arising demand for their services, general increases in staff have not, however, been allowed, but a considerable and/deliberate
deliberate effort has been made to redirect programmes ofwork towards problems of immediate concern to industry, and likely therefore to bring early benefits to the economy ofthe country and in the balance of payments.The Organisation of industrial research and developmentresources today16.    The research and development resources which theGovernment can deploy in support of industry should beconsidered against this background of change and develop-nent.    The majority are now the responsibility of theMinister of Technology, and this Green Paper is concernedwith the way in which they might be organised and managedin the future.17.    The changes contemplated would not affect all theMinistry&apos;s research and development resources.    The aero-space establishments,  of which the Royal Aircraft Establish-raent is the largest, support civil aerospace projects inaddition to their main defence programmes, and wherever possible they encourage civil applications of the resultsof defence research work.   But these establishments, which&apos;are being reduced in size, are inextricably part of theMinistry&apos;s defence procurement organisation and no changein this relationship is proposed.    Nor is it intended thatthe Research Associations should be directly involved inany proposed reorganisation;    the present arrangements forthe allocation of the substantial Government support forthis form of co-operative industrial research,  and for theMinistry of Technology&apos;s association with the review of programmes of work, will continue.18.    The work of certain of the Ministry&apos;s smaller civillaboratories is essentially governmental, rather thanindustrial in character.    Where appropriate, - and provided/satisfactory
satisfactory arrangements could be made to safeguard thecareers of the professional staff involved - these mightremain in the Ministry of Technology or be transferred toother Government departments following the precedents ofthe move of the Road Research Laboratory to the Ministryof Transport, and of the Building Research Station to theMinistry of Public Building and Works.19.    The research and development resources supported bythe Ministry of Technology with which this Paper is mainly concerned therefore comprise the following threeelements:-(a) Industrial Research EstablishmentsThe Ministry of Technology controls threecivil multi-purpose R&amp;D establishments -the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), theNational Engineering Laboratory (NEL),and the Warren Spring Laboratory (WSL) -and two smaller but essentially industriallaboratories - the Hydraulics ResearchStation (HRS) and the Forest ProductsResearch Laboratory (FPRL).    these establishments contain in all nearly 1,500professional staff from a wide spectrum of scientific and technological disciplines,putting an impressive range of expertise atthe service of Government and industry.(b) The Atomic Energy AuthorityThis is the largest Government-sponsoredorganisation for Research and Developmentalthough it also has production responsibilities.Its creation, growth and development duringthe past 16 years illustrates dramatically the pace of change in new technologies.    the atomic energy establishments were set up bythe Ministry of Supply shortly after the war/to meet-8-
to meet defence needs, and when the authority was incorporated in 1954 it inherited sone17,000 employees.    Y/ithin 8 years thetotal was more than doubled, to 41,000and since then the number has beenreduced to some 31,000.The Authority successfully fulfilled bothits main military and civil purposes.Out of its research and development programmes have grown a new power sourceand a new nuclear fuel industry.    12% ofthe country&apos;s electricity was generatedin 1968 by nuclear power stations, and in1968/69 the authority&apos;s factory atSpringfields produced nuclear fuelelements equivalent to 30 million tons of coal.    The proposed transfer ofthis factory and other production plantsto nuclear fuel and radiochemicalcompanies would still leave an R &amp; Dorganisation bigger than that set up in1954, but its programme is no longerlimited to nuclear work.    The Authority1sdefence and reactor development programmes are now.declining, having achieved theirinitial aims, while there has been a growing appreciation of the s^ope for applyingin other ways the techniques and skillsdeveloped for nuclear purposes.Section 4 of the 1965 Science and technology Act gave the Minister of technology power to require the Authority/to ..-9-
to &quot;undertake programmes of non-nuclearwork.     This work now amounts to about 4sM. a year; payments to the Authoritityin respect of such work amount   to about igM a year.     The extent to whichindustry seeks the Authority&apos;s assistancein a wide range of fields indicates thatthe service available is valued.    Oneof the intentions is to assist the balance ofpayments situation, and some contributionhas been made to this.    For example,industry has, with the Authority&apos;ssupport, secured important orders fordesalination plant in the face ofinternational competition. &apos;Some non-nuclear work, and some work in aid of the nuclear&quot; reactor programme,is undertaken by the Atomic WeaponsResearch Establishment (A7/RE) but it remains essentially a defence establishmentwhereas a new organisation wouldconcentrate on civil industrial research and development.    It might at thattime be judged appropriate to transferA\7RE to the Civil Service,  either tothe Ministry of Defence or to the Ministryof Technology, v:/hen it might be possibleto rationalise AWRE&apos;s work with that of otherdefence research establishments./(c)-10-
(c)     National Research Development corporation in the past twenty years NRDC has accumulatedskill in the exploitation of inventionsand wide experience of joint ventures with industry.    It has secured some notablesuccesses, and in 1968-69 it broke even,for the first time, on its revenue account;moreover the forecasts made by theCorporation for the next few years suggestthat it will continue to operate successfully.Nevertheless NRDC&apos;s activities are atpresent on a limited scale, and advantagesshould accrue from widened opportunities for its management capabilities.Its commercial know-how and knowledge ofindustry&apos;s needs should also be brought tobear more directly on programmes ofgovernment industrial R&amp;D, to involve thegovernment&apos;s research staffs more fully inthe exploitation of their inventions.The Management of the Ministry of Technology&apos;s Resources20.    These resources are all sponsored and financed by one Ministry, but in a variety of ways.    The industrial research establishments are staffed by civil servants and subject to central controls;   NRDC, as a statutorycorporation, has freedom to act within the terms ofits statute; while the h^ ?an only function, in non-nuclear matters, in response to a specificrequirement from the Minister./21 ..-11-
21.   Measures have been taken however to ensure thatprogrammes are closely related to the needs of industry.Increasing use is being made of the Programmes AnalysisUnit, which is a joint venture between the Ministry of technology and the Atomic Energy Authority, to assess the potential economic benefits which might berealised, before R &amp; D programmes are undertaken.In addition, in a number of civil technological fields,Advisory Committees mainly consisting of industrialistshave been set up to advise the Minister of Technology onprogrammes of research carried out or supported byhis Department, with particular emphasis on theirrelevance to industrial needs.Current problems22.    The simultaneous development of work for industry which is taking place within the Ministry of Technology&apos;sown organisation, staffed by civil servants, and inan independent statutory corporation (the sea)raises the problem of how to avoid overlappingprogrammes and conflicts of interest.   although these difficulties are being tackled and may be over-come, it is difficult to envisage a completelysatisfactory solution, unless the resources can bebrought together under the same management regimesonly then could programmes be fully rationalised andthe greatest benefits be secured.   Rationalisationtherefore requires a reshaping of the Government&apos;industrial research and development resources by bringing them together in one organisation.23.    A combined body would have to be within or outsidethe Civil Service.   To set it up inside the CivilService would be a move away from industry and would run counter to the &quot;hiving-off&quot; approach the PultonCommittee favoured.    A separate body,  outside the/Civil ..-12-
Civil Service, would be better able to rationaliseprogrammes, and to operate more flexibly, and wouldbe freer to associate its research and developmentresources more closely with industry.24.    The non-nuclear work the sea does for industry can   not however be divorced from its nuclearactivities.     This makes it particularly difficultto plan the future of the reactor establishments,which work closely with the research establishment at Harwell in carrying out jointly the reactordevelopment programmes; the reactor establishmentsare also working on some very valuable non-nuclear projects&apos; and they are inevitably running down sharply in staff numbers as a result of thesuccess of the earlier reactor research programmes.These are all arguments for keeping the ReactorGroup establishments together at present with theAuthority&apos;s Research Group establishments atHarwell and Culham.    On the other hand, industry&apos;sneeds for reactor research facilities will grow asthe restructured nuclear plant industry gainsstrength, and the CEGB&apos;s need for research anddevelopment on the operation of their nuclear power stations will expand as new nuclear systems for electricity generation are commissioned.     the nuclear plant and generating industries must therefore be more closely associated with reactorR&amp;D, as their own programmes build up.   Any new organisation should therefore manage Governmentfinanced reactor establishments in a way which willpositively foster this closer association, whileseeking, in the meantime, to arrange for more workto be undertaken by the reactor establishments under/contract ..
contract from the industries.    Ia time the balanceof ef ort on. reactor R&amp;D could progressively heshifted away from the new organisation and moretowards the industries concerned, including theproposed nuclear fuel company as well as the nuclear plant firms and the generating hoards.25.    A new organisation would have to tackle amore fundamental defect in present arrangements.Experience in this country and abroad suggeststhat no Government Department can decide centrallywhat research programmes are best designed toserve the needs of industry.    As a general rule,only the &quot;customer&quot; knows what he wants, andby his readiness   to pay for it makes the &quot;supplier&quot;aware of his requirements,    This proposition hasto be qualified for the reasons given in paras. 9,10 and 14 above, but it is of crucial importance.A contractual relationship between Governmentlaboratories and their &quot;customers&quot; is essential ifthe programmes and size of these establishments isto be directly related to real needs.,The proposed solution26.    For all these reasons - the need to rationaliseprogrammes in sea and Ministry of Technologyestablishments; the need to link Governmentlaboratories more closely with industry so they canbetter understand and more readily help to solvesome of its problems; and the need for work tobe undertaken increasingly on a contractual and commercial basis - the Government is consideringsetting up a new organisation, outside the CivilService, in which all these research and developmentresources would be brought together under asingle management./27 ..-14-
III.    A BRITISH RESEARCH.. AND. DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION27.    The proposed new body would be a statutorycorporation, possibly called the British Research andDevelopment Corporation (BPDC).    Its aims and functions would be: -(i)    to encourage and support the development and application of innovation and technologicalimprovement in industry for the benefit of the uk economy;    and to carry out research anddevelopment for this purpose, both itself and in collaboration with industry and on repayment;(ii)    to carry out research programmes necessary inthe public interest,  including basic research,and other specific programmes of v^ork requiredby Government Departments and other public authorities;(iii)    to exploit where appropriate innovations resultingfrom Government financed programmes carried outby other agencies.28.    BRDC would comprise the existing resources of the/ISA&apos;s Reactor and Research Groups,  of the Ministry&apos;s mainindustrial research establishments and of the NationalResearch Development Corporation.    It would be a powerfulorganisation, at the outset employing between h.,000 and5,000 professional staff with a gross expenditure of about 70M annually.    The numbers of professional staff andbudgets of the separate organisations are given in an annex.29.    Government work, including Government work of an industrial character such as the Reactor R&amp;D programme,would inevitably comprise the bulk of the BRDC&apos;s programme and would provide the greater part of its revenue for someyears to come.    Basic research, advisory services and statutory work might be funded by a Grant-in-Aid, butspecific tasks or projects for Government departments wouldbe charged at full costs.    A gradual change to a contractual relationship should help to bring about a/marked
marked change of attitude within departments, whichwill have to pay for the work they want done, as well aswithin the Corporation, which will have to satisfy itscustomers.    Financial expenditure would be reallocatedbetween the Ministry of Technology and the departments which would assume responsibility for the cost of R &amp; Dprojects, but there would be no increase in totalGovernment expenditure.30.    The biggest single element of BRDCs programme would be the reactor development programme.    This is currently costing some  27M a year but this level ofexpenditure is expected to decline in the next fiveyears.   Whereas at present the sea is responsible both for advising the Government on the size and shape ofthis programme, and for carrying it out, BRDC would be relieved of the former task and its role would be limitedto executing the programme under -contract from theGovernment.    The Government itself would be advised byan Atomic Energy Board.    The Minister of Technologyannounced in July 1968 the government&apos;s intention toestablish.,  this board;    its exact powers and dutiesremain to be worked out in detail, it would include representatives of the design and constructioncompanies, the Generating Boards and the proposed NuclearFuel Company, and one of its main tasks would be to seethat the national effort in support of nuclear power isdeployed to the best advantage.31.   The Minister of Technology would appoint the Boardof the Corporation and the Ministry would finance suchbasic research programmes as seemed desirable.    Adequatearrangements would be necessary for the Department todetermine or guide the broad lines of its programmes,but the Corporation would be free to undertake on itsown initiative work or investments on which it expectedto recover its costs.    it would however be required to operate within the general framework of the Government&apos;industrial policies.    Special arrangements   will be/made-16-
made to ensure that regional considerations will &quot;betaken into account in BRDC&apos;s activities, especially inrelation to the location of its establishments.32.    Given this degree of freedom, BRDC would be able to engage in joint ventures with industry sharing costs andrisks.    The inclusion within this new Corpor-ation of theNRDC would assist the development by this new body of an appropriate outlook to exploitation of new developments and bring about the benefits which have been discussedwithin para. 19c above.    In effect the inclusion orintegration of 1TRDC into the new Corporation would providethe essential element in its management structure whichdirected its attention to the need to secure a return onits work and investment.    There would, of course, be no restriction on BRDC&apos;s activitiesi in exploiting inventionsmade by other bodies, as NRDC does now.33.    For reasons already explained the BRDC would berequired to arrange for most of its work to be undertaken on a contractual basis?    In view of the Government1s wideresponsibilities, it would inevitably be the major customer.The &quot;Government&quot; takes many forms however, and it wouldbe a healthy discipline for departments and organisations to have to pay directly for the programmes they sponsor.The &quot;bulk of the civil work carried out at the research and Development Establishments for Government could beundertaken under contract from the Departments concerned.Statutory responsibilities would continue to make heavycalls on Research and Development resources, as wouldother activities within the Establishments such as advisoryservices:    and programmes of relevant basic research must continue.    All this work carried out in the public interestmust continue to be financed direct from public funds.3h*    The Corporation&apos;? work for industry should clearly be conducted on a contractual basis, on repayment or as jointlyfunded ventures, because industrial participation is the simplest test of the value to industry of the work inGovernment Establishments.    It is not possible to estimate/exactly-17-
exactly how much of such work industry would want;hut if a new Research and Development organisationwere set up which&apos; would live to a growing extent onits earnings from contracts, joint ventures, royaltjrarrangements, etc., its success in meeting the needsof industry would play a part in determining the eventual level at which it operated.    Such success would,over a period, make it possible to reduce the level ofGovernment subsidy for industrial research, and theextent and nature of such work undertaken in Governmentlaboratories would thus . be increasingly determined by industry itself.affinp; arrangements35.   Arrangements will be made for the present staff ofthe various organisations that would comprise the new body to be transferred with their work to the proposedcorporation.    This would bring together staff, some ofwhom acre at present civil servants, and a larger numberof sea staff.   Their present conditions of service differ in various respects but arrangements would be made, inconsultation with the staff representatives, to ensurethat their terms   of employment with the corporation were no less favourable than those they now have.    Theterms and conditions of service of employees recruitedafter it is established would be a matter for theCorporation:    but it would be important to ensure thatstaff could transfer readily between the Corporation,industry and other research organisations both within and outside the civil service.    Changes in superannuationarrangements which would facilitate this are being examined as part of the present joint official and staff side review of civil service superannuation.&apos; IT CONCLUSIDN36.    It is an important national objective to ensure thatthe valuable resources which are devoted to research inGovernment-financed laboratories in the Ministry of technology and the Atomic Energy Authority should make the/greatest-18-
greatest possible contribution to industrial success, andthat they should be of the right size for this purpose.A major effort is being made to secure this objectivewithin the present organisation lout it is and will beinhibited so long as these resources are fragmented and lack the full driving force of a common management orientatedto the requirements of its customers, in an organisationexposed to the pressure of the market.    The Government istherefore considering setting up a new statutory corporation to manage these powerful resources.37.    There is already a greater awareness that the future will be shaped increasingly bj the decisions that are reached on the deployment of highly qualified manpower:such views have been expressed in Parliament and throughthe work of the Select Committee on Science and Technology.However,  the importance of the specific issues set out inthis Green Paper makes it desirable that there should be afull and informed public debate before decisions are taken.It is the purpose of the Paper to stimulate such a &quot;debate.-19-
