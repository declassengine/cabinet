C(69) 157 COPY NO.?.4thNovember, 1969CABINETpQLJCE^n.Li-MyTUAL ATOAJ^SPECIAIi^poW&apos;ers&quot;actsMemorandum by the Secretary of State for defence i sympathise with the Home Secretary!s motives in proposing(C(69) 15 6) to table an amendment to the Police Bill which would preclude any Great Britain policeman provided for the assistance ofthe Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) under the mutual aid provisionof the Bill, from exercising the powers conferred upon the RUC by theSpecial Powers Acts and the regulations made under thema    But Sheintroduction of such an amendment would raise great difficulties forthe Army in Northern ireland      It would also have implications for thefuture Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR).2C Members of HM Forces on duty are empowered under Section 7of the 1922 Act and under certain regulationss-(a) To exercise the powers of a constable in effecting arrestsin respect of any crime or any offence against theregulations (Section 7 of the Act),(b) To search premises and vehicles ^i&amp;ouS % -/arrant(Regulation 4)o(c) To stop and search vehicles (Regulation 5),(d) To stop and search persons on suspicion of carryingfirearmse etc,   (Regulation 6).,(e) To stop persons and require answers to questions(Regulation 7).(f) To arrest without warrant on suspicion of action prejudicial to the preservation of the peace, etc (PvCguktion 1.1 (1) -the remaining sections of Regulation 11 do not confer any powers upon members of HM Forces),(g^    To require persons from outside Northern Ireland tosatisfy the police authorities that their presence inNorthern Ireland is not detrimental to the preservation ofthe peace, etc.   (Regulation 20).ffltf; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
(h)    To require the production of any article,. book0 document,etc   (Regulation 21)*(j)    When an order is issued by the civil authorities, to stopany person leaving a designated ship in. a designated port(Regulation 37),Most of these powers have been used regularly and necessarily by theArmy since it wa3 called in to aid the civil power in August-, and I would regard all of them (except possibly that conferred by Regulation 37)as essential in present circumstances for the Army5s effectivefunctioning,,3,     If we refused to allow British pc?.$$era u&apos;: a*a  $n Jiolp the RUCto operate the provisions of the Special Powers Acts, attention would befocused on the fact that Servicemen are using certain of these powersall the time in support of the civil power in Northern Ireland^    the inevitable public pressure to deny the use of these powers to the troops would be difficult   to ree;!6t? and yet we would have to resist it if theArmy were to continue fulfilling its present respomAbilities in NorthernIreland.4.     Moreover, if British policemen sent to help in Northern Irelanddid not have these powers, they would surely be very much less effective in the sort of situation for which their presence would be required,,And this would bring forward the stage at which troops might have to becalled out in. aid of the civil power,5.     Similarly, any inadequacies in the powers of the police inNorthern Ireland could require the use of the Ulster special constabulary earlier than would otherwise be necessary - and perhaps in circumstances in which their operations were not fully controlled onthe spot by the RUC with its British components,,    This is something thatwe wish to avoid at all costsa6.      The analogy between using British police to help the RUC and using military forces in support of the civil power is obviously a closeone, even though their roles are different,    If we made the concessionthat the Home Secretary proposes as regards the British police.^ manyMPs would undoubtedly insist that the UBR Bill should be similarlyamended.   I should have to resist this pressure since powers of thekind that the Army is now using are of the essence of the role that weenvisage for the UDR.7.     The fundamental point is whether we can continue to toleratethe existence of the Special Powers Acts and regulations in NorthernIrelandg  or whether we shoxald bring the strongest pressure to bear on northern Ireland Ministers to repeal the Special Powers Acts and substitute for them some more acceptable legislation which, would give us and them the powers which it is both sensible and essential for us
both to have,    if we bring in an amendment to the Police Bill, we shallweaken, not increase,; this pressure on Northern Ireland Ministers,I propose therefore that we should concentrate on the fundamentalissue, and reject the proposal to amend the Police Bill in the sense proposed by the Home Secretary.D.
