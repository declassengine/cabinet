DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(69)1668th December. 1969COPY NO.CABINET^ AI^QOVEJW^^^^I^EH^^iZB Pi.       *-J?e?re^ayy of,State for LocalGovernment and. Regional PlanningWe aim to publish a White Paper early in the New Year setting out the main changes which we propose to make to the structure of localgovernment in England in the light of the Redcliffe-Maud report.,   the comments we have received on it and the discussions we have had withthe local authority associations,,    In this paper I set out the main con-elusions of the Ministerial Committee on Local Government Reorganisationon structure, and I seek the Cabinet^ agreement to them.    There will befurther points which will come before the Cabinet at a later stage.The main features of the Redcllffe-Maud prop033!3The four main elements cf the structure recommended byRed-cliffe-Maud were?(a) Throughout most of the country, local government functions would be concentrated ir. the hands of a single tier of58 unitary authorities, with populations generally between25 0,000 and .oj?.e mMSioa arad      reusing jurisdiction werareas combining town and country.,    The Commission sawgreat strength in the unitary principle, arguing that the all-purpose authority can take a comprehensive view of the needsof its area and that its responsibility is clear fur all to see.(b) However, in the three metropolitan areas of Merseyside, Selnecand the West Midlands there would be a two-tier structuregenerally comparable to that in Greater London.    Phumingj,transport and major development functions would be exercised by a metropolitan authority, and a second tier of largemetropolitan districts (?0 in all) would be responsible among other things for the main personal services of education,healths welfare, child care and housing (though some overallhousing functions would also resfc with the metropolitanauthority).
(c) At a lower level in the unitary areas there would be local councils operating - at least initially - within the areas ofthe present county boroughs^ non-county borotighs, urban districts and parishes.    Their main function would be torepresent local opinion^ but they would have some limitedexecutive powers to provide local amenities and facilities.    TheCommission also thought that, with the consent of the unitaryauthority, some of the larger local councils might share in theadministration of some of the main statutory services.    In themetropolitan d stricts9 the Commission recommended that local councils should be optional - to be established if the local inhabitants wished it.(d) At the regional or provincial level,, the Commission proposedthat provincial councils should be elected by the main localauthorities, but they should also have co-opted members.These Councils weuld replace the existing regional economic planning councils and would settle (subject to Ministerialapproval) the provincial strategy and planning framework within which the unitary and metropolitan planning authorities would operate.General reactions and ccmclu^ion^3.     The comments on the Commission^ report have reflected a great variety of opinion.    There is almost universal support, however, for thethree principles which we accepted when the report was published; that a major rationalisation is needed, that there should be a substantial reduction in the number of authorities with statutory responsibilities, andthat the new units should reflect the interdependence of town and country.4.     The views of the mal&apos;2 local authority associations are influenced,naturally, by the way in. which their member authorites would be affectedby the proposals.    Both the County Councils1 Association (CCA) and theAssociation of Municipal Corporations (AMC) support the main essence of the report - unitary authorities throughout most of the country j but two-tiers in the more populous areas.    But the AMC want more and smallerunitary areas, and are prepared to see some executive functions given tothe pr-ovinees; while the CCA want some additional metropolitan areas,but fewer and larger unitary areas.     The CCA are also concerned aboutthe effectiveness of the Redcliffe-Maud local councils as a democraticcomplement to the unitary authorities, and so they favour in addition theestablishment of area or district committees of the unitary authorities(referred to in paragraph 19 below).    The Rteal District CouncilsfAssociation (RDCA) and the Urban District Councilsr Association (UDCA)both want two tiers of local government everywhere, each responsiblefor statutory services % the CCA have recently flirted with the same idea,but are clearly divided amongst themselves on this issue.(2)
5, The dissenting memorandum from Mr. Derek Senior, whosuggested a general two-tier solution, has attracted some but notwidespread support,6.     We cannot reach conclusions on the organisation at provinciallevel until the Grcwther Commission has reported.    But for the rest,the Ministerial Committee support the main principles of the Redcliffe-M&amp;rsdstructure^. that is, unitary authorities In most parts of the country,two executive levels in the metropolitan areas, and local councils.    Thispattern differs from those proposed for Scotland by Wheatley and for wales in the WMte Paper; both, these envisage two tiers.    We think,however, that the differences between the three countries adequatelyjustify a difference in local government structures, especially if a two-tier structure in Scotland and Wales is supported by national sentiment.7.     However, while wishing to depart from the Redcliffe-Maud proposals as little as possible and to stay within their broad framework, the ministerial Committee nevertheless propose certain modifications asfollows.Metropolitan areas^8.      The Commission believed that a two-tier structure was neededwhere the area required for planning, transportation and major develop-ment   contained too large a population for the administration of the personal services by a single authority.    Hence their proposal for threemetropolitan areas in Merseyside, Selnec and the West Midlands.9.     We accept the Commission&apos;s case for two tiers In these areas andalso the need to draw the boundaries of the metropolitan areas widely, asthe Commission have done.    We propose, however, a come whatdifferent distribution of functions in the metropolitan areas, and also anincrease in the number of such areas.10.     As to the division of functions, we take the view that educationwould be more efficiently and economically planned and provided if itwere made a function of the metropolitan authorities rather than themetropolitan districts,    True, this would mean that it would be separated from the other personal social services and from the main housingfunction.    Nevertheless, we believe that on balance it shotild be a top-tierfunction.11.     There might also be functional advantages in making themetropolitan authority wholly responsible for housing, in view of theproblems of redevelopment and obsolescence in the conurbations.    but such a change would greatly reduce the credibility of the metropolitandistricts.    Although, therefore, we think that the metropolitan authority should have somewhat stronger housing functions than the Commissionrecommended, we still favour leaving the main housing function with themetropolitan districts.    This io of course the position in London, wherereorganisation has already taken place.-3-
12.     I turn to the number of metropolitan areas.     The Royal Commissionconsidered but rejected other possible candidates besides the three theyfinally recommended,,    Subsequently, proposals for additional such areas have beer, made by the CCA, the Party, and a considerable number of independent critics.    And there are indeed several parts of She country where it would be desirable to have a single planning authority coveringtwo or more adjacent unitary areas, and where a metropolitan authority might also have advantages for education, housing and in some casestransportation.    An increase in the number of two-tier authorities wouldmoreover slightly increase the number of councillors exercising real power.Against this, however, we have to set th*j general advantages of a unitarysystem, and the danger that if we extend a two-tie i system to a largenumber of areas it will be difficult to resist the pressure to adopt itthroughout the country.13.     In the light of these conflicting arguments, we   examinedparticularly six additional areas where the case for a metropolitan two-level structure has been urged most strongly.(i)   We are unanimous in thinking that additional metropolitanareas should be created in West Yorkshire (Redciiffe*Maud areas 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) and South Hampshireajnd^eJsJe^o^iyLgju (areas 57 and 5 8).    The WestYorkshire area has formidable problems of planning and obsolescence;   Hampshire is an area of exceptionallyrapid growth which needs to be planned as a whole.(ii)   A majority of the Committee favour on merit (thoughrecognising the political problem) a metropolitan area in Central Lancashire (areas 18, 19, 20 and 21).    Thefour proposed unitary areas are not self-sufficientsBlackburn and Burnley, in particular, already haveproblems in common; and, if the proposed CentralLancashire New Town goes ahead, the case for treatingthe whole area as a single rmit for planning purposes willbe even stronger.(iii) Nottingham/Derby (areas 29 and 30) and Sou*h &quot;Yorkshire(areas 12, and 13) had only minority support in theCommittee, though I personally strongly favour Notts-Derbyon the same grounds as South Hampshire.(iv) We unanimously rejected a new metropolitan area builtround Tjfnejidej though we accepted that Northumberlandraised a special problem which might have to be dealtwith at a later stage and, its amalgamation with Tynesidein a single unitary authority considered.4-
14.     The present population of England, outside Greater London, is38.1 million.    The extent to which we would be moving towards ageneral two-tier system by creating additional metropolitan areas canbe gauged as follows s-Cumulatiye Total(a) Redcliffe-Maud metropolitan areasMerseyside 2. lmSeinec 3. 2roWest Midlands 3. Om 8. 3m(b) West Yorkshire 2.2mHampshire and Isle cfWight 1,1m 11. 6m(c) Central Lancashire 1. \in 12. 7m(d) Derby /Notts 1.9mSoath Yorkshire 1. 4m 16. OmJi we created all these eight as metropolitan areas then, with greater London, the total population in England living in areas of two-tiergovernment would be 23, 8 million out of 45. 9 million.15.     Our conclusion is that we should create at least two additionalmetropolitan areas in West Yorkshire and South Hampshire,    A majorityof the Committee supported a metropolitan area in Central Lancashire,while recognising that other considerations besides intrinsic merit might come into play.    A minority supported Notts/Derby and South Yorkshire,But we all agreed that we must provide machinery to allow for futurechanges in the light of new developments and the growth of population;e. g. Humberside and the Northampton/Bedford area (which containsMilton Keynes and other growth points) aspe areas, in addition to those mentioned above, which may need overall planning authorities at a later stage.Unitary Areas16.    Some people have advocated additional unitary areas, notably theAMC and Sir Francis Hill and E.eg Wallis in their note of reservation tothe report    On the other hand, Jack Longland (in another note ofreservation) and the CCA would favour somewhat fewer.    The creation ofmore and smaller unitary areas would be bad both for planning and for education; indeed it can be argued that fcr both these services we should move towards larger units than the report proposed instead of smaller.We are therefore unanimously against creating more unitary areas, andwe would not exclude the possibility of reducing the number of such areasat a later etage by amalgamation,,-5-
Local Councils17.     Redcliffe-Maud proposed that all existing councils except RDCsshould be kept in being, at least for a period of five years, as local councils.    They would not exercise main statutory functions, but wouldhave the right to be consulted by the unitary authorities, and the powerto incur expenditure for the benefit of their locality and to provide purely local facilities, and Amenities.    This proposal has been heavily criticised,especially as the local councils would vary in size from Sheffield down tothe smallest parish.    Nevertheless a large majority of the ministerial committee believe that it would be politically impossible simply to abolish all existing councils (e. g, in small and medium-sized towns);and indeed most of us believe that local participation is good in itself.18.     We therefore sought to find a way to give the concept of local councils more reality than it has in Redcliffe-Maud.   We agree with thereport that these councils should have limited   executive and spendingpowers in the field of local amenities.    We agree that they should htve a consultative function.    And we would add also that they should be able tomake appointments (for example) to governing bodies wf &amp;cI*ools,management committees for old peoples&apos; homes, local employment committees,youth employment committees and local sports councils.19.     But we have tried to find for them an additional positive function,We do not agree with Redcliffe-Maud that even the larger local councils should have any responsibility for the operation of the main statutoryservices, because this would lead directly to divided responsibility   andconfusion.    But we think we can find such a function by another route.We recommend that the legislation should require unitary authoritiesto prepare schemes for decentralising the administration of appropriatemain services to district committeeev and that the local councils should nominate some (perhaps half or even more) members to serve on these committees.    These committees would be committees of the unitaryauthority, whose staff would service them.     A committee system ofthis kind is supported by the CCA and is already operated by certain countries in particular fields, chiefly development control.    Not all themain services are suited to this form of decentralised administration,but it could cover, for example, development control, housingimprovement work, countryside questions, parks, sports and recreations;the CCA, the UDCA and the RDCA would add the social work services aswell.    We need further consultation among Departments and with the localauthority associations on the range of these decentralised services.    but whatever the exact range, we would substantially increase the attractive-ness of serving on a local council by arrangements of this kind.20.     Local ^councils of this kind would seem well adapted to the needsnot only of rural parishes, but of the many hundreds of 6mall and medium-sized towns.    But they would not make much sense in the 20 or30 large b-oroughs with populations sraj&amp;gl&amp;g from 100,000 up to one million,Eventually-, therefore, local council boundaries will have to be reviewed,and the larger towns may have to be split up.    We agree with-6-
Redcliffe-Mavid that it wculd be Impracticable tc review the enormousnumber of areas involved as part of the introduction of the new system,,On the other handa it should not be necessary (as the Commissionproposed) for the existing areas to remain unchanged for at least fiveyears while the new system settled down,    The sensible solution would therefore be to publish our main conclusions in the White Paper,, and then to discuss with the associations the procedure and timing of the review oflocal council areas, and in particular the possibility of special arrange-ments in me large towns which will also be the headquarters of the unitaryauthorities and where the co-existence of the unitary authority and a localcouncil could raise awkward problemsa    (We shall also want to discussthe need for local councils in metropolitan districts and the machineryfor ascertaining local wishes on this point),Conclusion21,       The Ministerial Committee are, of course,, also consideringother matters which will be dealt with in the White Fapers including localgovernment finance and the further consultations which we shall need tohave on areas and staffing matters,,    But in ihe meantime,, I seek mycolleagues11 agreement to the conclusions on the structure of localgovernment outlined aboveS&quot;(a)    That the Redcliffe-Maud proposals for the unitary,, metropolitanand metropolitan district authorities be accepted,, subject to -(i) education being made a top-tier function in themetropolitan areas8 and the housing functions ofthe metropolitan authorities being strengthened?(paragraphs 10 and 11)$(ii) the creation of additional metropolitan areas in west Yorkshire,, South Hampshire and the isle of Wight,, and perhaps Central Lancashire(paragraphs 13-&quot;15)0That we should reject the creation of more unitary areasa but should not wholly exclude the possibility of amalgamating someof the unitary areas proposed by Red cliff e- Maud -ego Northum.berland/Tyneeide (paragraphs 13 and 16)0(c)    That the Redcliffe-Maud proposals for local councils be acceptedsave thats (paragraphs 17-20)(i) local councils should have no responsibility for theoperation of the main services;(ii) statutory arrangements should be made to ensure thatthe unitary authorities decentralise the administrationof suitable functions to district committees to which local councils would also appoint members?(b)
(iii)   we should have discussions with the local authority-associations, after the White Paper has been published,on such aspects of the local council proposals as the subsequent review of areas, the future of local councils in metropolitan districts, and the special situation intowns which will be the headquarters of the unitaryauthorities.(d)    That we defer decisions as regards provincial arrangementstmtil the Crowther Commission have reported,    (paragraph 6).C, A.0 CaStorey&apos;s Gate, S.W. 1.8th December, 1969-8-SEGRET
