RELIEF FOR BIAPRAPaper by the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeand the Ministry of DefenceSummary1.    Ihe need is estimated at 500 tons of food and medicines aday,2. Failing a land or river route (on which there seems no prospect of agreement), a daylight airlift offers the bestpractical way of meeting this need.3. The ICRC could, with the agreement of the parties, operatesuch an airlift from Cotonou up to a maximum of 500 tons a day at a cost of about  48,000 per 500 tons.4.   The RAF could pperate a similar airlift under similar conditions but from RAF resources alone could only lift amaximum of 100 tons a day.     The extra cost would be about 50?000 per 500 tons in a sustained operation (and there, wouldbe extensive detriment to Defence capabilities.)    Political-agreement would be even more difficult to obtain than for ICRCaircraft.5-   RAF airdrops (by parachute or free dropping) would also bepossible on similar conditions and this would permit the dropping of about  60   tons a day at a cost of some  70,000- 80,000 or more for every 500 tons dropped by free drop;    aonce-for-all parachute drop could deliver about 350 tons in ashort period at a cost (including the value of equipment written off) of about  240,000, but this could not bo continued.     Many
of the problems now preventing daylight flights would also apply to airdrops, including Biafran demands for guarantees,inspection and call-down difficulties and identification.The Federal Government is unlikely to agree and the Biafransare not likely to accept drops by the RAF.6.    The Royal Navy could fairly readily provide one aircraft carrier.jarand helicopters for a limited period of about 13 days next month but during that .period only about 500 tons in all couldbe lifted (i.e.  only one day&apos;s requirements in 15 days) at atotal extra cost of  150,000- 200,OOQ.     A sustained operation on this scale would., seriously affect naval and RAF capabilities.A carrier and helicopter operation on a big enough scale to boworth mounting would require large-scale American participationbut the United States Government have told us in confidence that they are unwilling to contemplate such participation inview of the cost, logistic difficulties and political objections.     The total cost of delivering 400 tons a day isestimated by the Americans to be about  1 million per week, not including the capital cost  of the aircraft if speciallypurchased for the operation.     The Federal Government has inany case rejected the plan as an affront to its sovereignty..The ICRC fear that it may detract from the main effort to get agreement on daylight flights.      Other governments agreeabout the cost and other difficulties.conclusion.   The top priority should bo support for the ICRCs efforts- 2 -
to secure agreement on daylight flights, which are &quot;by far themost practical of those proposals which stand any chance ofbeing agreed by tho two sides.      Wo do not believe that thehelicopter/carrier plan or air drops are likely to offerpracticable and acceptable alternatives;    and for daylightflights the ICRC are likely to be more acceptable to bothsides than the RAP.
A.    Ne ed g__rf-Bi af r a8.      The- latest estimate (&quot;by an American Government medicalteam who were in Biafra in November) of the population in theenclave is 3.2 -million.9.      Joint Church Aid have recently said that they are flying in en average 200 tons cf relief supplies nightly (6,000 tons per month).      In addition, supplies are being fl^wn in by theFrench Red Cross and Africa Concern - probably about 1+00-590tons monthly.10.      Estimates of need by the relief organisations vary from,000 to 18,000 tons per month; probably 15,000 tons (500 tons per day) is as good an estimate as can be made.      The short-fall is therefore about 8,000-9,000 tons per month.      But sinceany agreed plan for taking in relief will need to replace theexisting (illegal) night airlifts,  rather than to supplementthem,  the target figure should be about 500 tens per day.- k -CONFIDENTIAL
B. Land Corridors/River Routes11. There is no doubt that the best solution of all would be aland corridor or river route.     The following schemes have beenput forward during the last 18 months:(a) At the Niamey peace talks in July 1968, the Biafranswere reported to have proposed two routes;    a demilitar-ised zone from Port&apos; Harcourt through Igrita, and a rivercorridor along the River Niger to Oguta.      The majorpoint of difference arose from the proposed establishmentof a demilitarised zone, with international supervision.This was unacceptable to the Federal Government.(b) At Addis Ababa, in the summer of 1968 the Emperor of ethiopia proposed routes;(I) by road, rail and air to the Enugu-Awgu area;(ii) by sea to Burutu, and thence by barge to the Aba area;(iii) by road to Asaba and then by ferry to the Onitsha area..The Federal Delegation agreed to those proposals with theexception of the river route which they wanted to go fromWarri to Asaba.     The Biafrans rejected both land routes andwould agree only to a river route to Oguta.      This was unacceptable to the Federal side on the grounds that Ogutawas only about eight miles from Uli airstrip and theneutralisation of the route to Oguta would in effect shieldUli, their main military target, from capture.(c) The Lowenstein plan the American Congressman, Mr. Allard Lowenstein, put
forward a plan in December 1968 by which relief supplies could be sent from outside Nigeria in day-light to the Obilago airstrip (by then in the hands ofthe F.M.,G.) and taken from Obilago by road into therebel-held areas.     The airstrip and supplies were tobe controlled by international inspectors.     TheFederal Government agreed to the proposal and made apublic offer in February 1969 to allow the route to bepoliced by O.A.U. civilian observers but the Biafransrejected it on the grounds of military security.v(d) The Luns Plan (January 1969)This was for. a river route from Degema in River state to Oguta but because of practical difficulties aboutthe route, and since it threatened .to.cut across theObilago proposal which.was then still being considered,the plan was not proceeded with and not put to either side.(e ) Cross River routeThis suggestion was put forward in January 1969 by theU.S. Government which provided two landing ships(LSMs), the Dona Mercedes and Dona Maria, and arranged for them to bo chartered by the ICRC.      These ships(subject to the river water level) could navigate the cross River to Biafran territory.     When the water level is high (from May to October) they would have a capacityof about 900 tons and according to the original- 6 -
estimates, some of which were later called in question,could together deliver about 7s00-^ tons a week to Biafra.From mid-December until May the water level in the CrossRiver would be too low for the LSMs to operate.    Althoughboth sides agreed publicly in principle when the plan was put forward, the F.M.G. later withdrew their approval and the Biafrans subsequently declared it unacceptablein the absence of a third party guarantee (they finallydemanded that the U.S. Government alone should undertake this).      The Biafrans also objected to Federalinspection of relief vessels .entering Nigerian waters.12.      The Americans still see no hopeful signs of acceptancefor the proposal.     There was no indication that the F.M.G.held altered their opposition to the route on grounds ofmilitary security; the opposition of the local populationsin the South-Eastern state,  and Biafran objections, must beregarded as unchanged.
C.   Daylight flights13.      Negotiations &quot;between the I.C.R.C.,  the Federal Governmentand. the Biafrans for daylight flights have been going on since june when the I.C.R.C. night flights were suspended, following the shooting down on 5 June of an I.C.R.C.  relief aircraft bythe Federal Government.      The I.C.R.G.  and the F.M.G.  signedan agreement on 13 September 1969 under which supplies could be flown to Uli between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. limited only by the capacity of the aircraft and airstrips involved and subject toinspection outside Federal area, the Federal Government&apos;s rightto call down selected aircraft for inspection in Lagos andthe understanding that the exercise would be without prejudice to Federal military operations.      This last stipulation wasclarified on 9 December in an announcement by the federal government that the .Federal Air Force would not attack Uliairport while I.C.R.C. aircraft were there during daylighthours and that Federal aircraft would not. e&apos;scort or followI.C.R.C. flights engaged in the relief operations..     TheFederal Government also undertook not to take militaryadvantage of the I.C.R.C. daylight airlift.1    Biafr?a agreed to daylight flights in early August subjectto these being without prejudice to the use of Uli.airport fortheir own operations.      They rejected the Federal agreement of13 September on the grounds that the clause stating that theflights should not prejudice Federal military activityendangered their own security and called for internationalguarantees against Federal military exploitation of the flights.A high level I.C.R.C. Mission in mid-October failed to secureBiafran agreement and the Biafrans also rejected assurancesby the Federal Government transmitted by the Americans.- 8 -
Logistic considerations15.    The ICRC estimate that daylight flights could carry up to amaximum of 500 tons daily, limited only by facilities at Uli.Tho ICRC could have 4 aircraft operational at two days&apos; notice;and. they reckon that sixteen aircraft  (some of which might beprovided and operated by organisations other than the ICRC, if both sides agreed) in all would be needed to deliver the maximum amount of 500 tons daily to Uli.     The ICRC estimates that 4aircraft, delivering 120 tons a day, would cost  350,000 per month.(or  48,500 for every 500 tons).     The unit cost woulddrop as the number of aircraft increased.Present position*16.    The ICRC intend to press the Biafrans hard to accept day-light flights on the,basis of the Federal Government1s assurances of 9 December and will probably seek to send another Missioninto Biafra for further discussions.Conclusions17.    Failing agreement on road or river routes, daylightflights offer by far the most practicable means of deliveringsupplies to Biafra and the ICRC (with much help from ourselves)have brought the two sides very close to agreement..     We andothers should be careful to avoid prejudicing the continuingefforts of the ICRC by launching alternative schemes, with a lesser capacity, which could well tempt Colonel Ojukwu to with-hold his agreement to daylight flights in the hope of gettingother arrangements which would bettor serve his political andmilitary interests.
D. R.A.F. airlift to Uli18.   Ministers have several times told Parliament that.M.G. would be willing to provide R.A.F. resources for anairlift of relief supplies into Biafra provided that bothsides agree and guarantee the safety of the aircraft andcrews.     This offer was made most recently by the PrimeMinister on 8 December.Logistic considerations19.   An R.A.F. airlift would require similar political conditions to those needed for I.C.R.C. operations, inparticular:    the agreement of both sides to the unimpededuse of airspace;    satisfactory assurances from both sidesabout the immunity of aircraft from air and ground attack;Biafran agreement to station a small R.A.P. party at Uli;P.M.G. assurances that Uli would be immune from attack bothby day and by night (the latter because R.A.P. personnel would be there continuously, and because some aircraft mighthave to stop overnight).20.   A preliminary reconnaissance of facilities, both at themounting airfield, Cotonou, and at the receiving airfield, Uli,would be essential to the success of the operation.     In advanceof this, our calculations are partly guesswork.     Assuming,however, that a force ff 8 Hercules or Argosy aircraft wereoperated at maximum capacity from Cotonou, and assuming.that-efficient loading and unloading arrangements were provided byother authorities at Cotonou and Uli, we estimate that about100 tons per day could be lifted, using the Hercules, or 60tons a day, using the Argosy.
21 .   We doubt that any larger force than 8 aircraft could be sustained in operation for any length of time over the extendedlines of communication with which we should be operating.     Wemust also assume, in the absence of a proper examination of facilities on the spot,  that Cotonou is strictly limited in thetotal number of aircraft it can handle,  and that if other authorities were operating concurrently, the scope for R.A.F.operations would be curtailed or eliminated.22.   The extra cost of R.A.F. operations on the scale describedwould be about  300,000 a month, using the Hercules (rather less using the Argosy).     A total R.A.F. party of about 150personnel, including a small detachment at Uli, would be needed(and is allowed for in the estimated costs).     A sustainedoperation would absorb a very large proportion of the totaleffort of the R.A.P. Hercules (or Argosy) force in view of the continuing air support which would be required for theoperation.     This would lead to large scale cancellation ofexercises, severe reductions in joint operational training ofcrews and the need to draw heavily on civil resources to make good the transport capacity which would otherwise be used for regular logistic movements world-wide.Political considerations23.   Colonel Ojukwu has repeatedly said that he will not acceptrelief or other aid from the British Government so long as weare supplying arms to the Federal Government.     He is thus less likely to agree to accept relief carried in R.A.F. aircraftthan in aircraft of the I-.C.R.C. or other Governments lesscommitted than H.M.G. to support of the Federal cause.CONFIDENTIAL- 11  -
The Federal Government might agree to allow R.A.F. aircraft to carry relief to Biafra through Federal airspace but probably only on the same conditions as those agreed with theI.C.R.C. for daylight flights - inspection on take-off,  rightof the Federal Government to call down individual flights for inspection at Lagos, no flights except between 9 and 5, andthe operation to be without prejudice to federal militaryoperations (as defined in the statement of 9 December).The Biafrans,  even if they were prepared to accept the R.A.F. &apos;as such, would probably also insist on international guaranteesagainst federal military exploitation of the airlift, and make their agreement subject to the continued use of Uli for theirown purposes.     They would also turn back, without permission to land, all flights called dwwn for inspection at Lagos.2h.   The active co-operation of the I.C.R.C. and the Governmentsof Dahomey or Equatorial Guinea would be essential;    theattitude of the new Dahomey Government is not yet known.25.   The conclusion must be that the I.C.R.C. or,  less probably,seme uncommitted Government or group of governments, is muchlikelier than the British Government to get the agreement ofboth sides to an airlift on acceptable terms.      If such agree-ment were to be secured and a daylight airlift established(probably by the I.C.R.C.), there might be a possibility laterof R.A.F. participation within the operating limits imposed bythe two airfields;    but the real need in those circumstances would be for financial contributions by H.M.G. and otherGovernments towards the cost of the airlift, rather thancontributions of aircraft or crews which are now and wouldprobably continue to be available in adequate numbers frommore neutral sources.
E. Air drops26. The possibility of dropping supplies, with or withoutparachutes, into Biafra has been considered by HMG (e.g. ina Chief of Staff assessment of September 1968) and others on many occasions and the ICRC has even done experiments usingSwiss crews and aircraft. The Canadians also regard this,technique as offering possibilities and a Canadian emissaryhas just visited Lagos to discuss the idea with the federal government.Logistic considerations27.     However conducted, air dropping is less efficient thanconventional airlift: fewer supplies can be moved by a givenforce in a given time; some supplies dropped are lost orspoiled; more men and more elaborate arrangements for handlirgsupplies are needed.    Its main advantage is that it would not require the use of Uli, but the other conditions essentialto a conventional operation would still be needed, inparticular: the agreement of both sides to unimpeded use ofairspace; immunity of aircraft to attack (aircraft engagedin air dropping are peculiarly vulnerable); Biafran agreement to the use and at least rudimentary marking of selecteddropping areas.   A preliminary reconnaissance, with theagreement of both sides, would be essential, including an air reconnaissance of the terrain.28.     For a free drop operation of the kind which the Canadiansappear to be studying we estimate that a force of 8 Herculesor Argosies operating (as before) from Cotonou might liftabout two thirds of the supplies which could be moved by* - 13 - ;   ;CONFIDENTIAL
the same force operating on conventional daylight flightsinto Uli, i.e. something of the order of   60   tons a day,using the Hercules, or about 2+0 tons a day, using the Argosy,(a proportion of these supplies being inevitably spoiled orlost at the receiving end).    The RAF party needed in WestAfrica would he about doubled, to roughly 250 personnel.The extra costs would be rather greater than for conventionalairlift, i.e. something approaching  350,000 per month.    the operational penalties would be as described for conventionalairlift.29.     Air dropping by parachute-borne containers is more effective than the free drop being studied by the Canadiansand has operational advantages (though it remains a less efficient use of aircraft capacity than conventional airliftinto a receiving airfield).    But it cannot be continued for more than a very short time unless arrangements exist forthe rapid and continuous return of parachutes and containersto the mounting airfield.    In the absence of such arrange-ments - which could not be expected in Nigeria - the RAFcould drop no more than a total of 350 short tons of supplies,writing-off in the process the whole of its available stock of parachutes and containers over and above the stock-level which needs to be retained if we are to maintain our cspabiliiyfor other possible operations.   A once-for-all operation onthis basis could be conducted within about a week at a totalcost (including the value of parachutes and containers) ofapproximately  2^0,000.    The operational penalties, though- 14-
significant, would be substantially less than for thesustained operations considered above.Political considerations30.     It would only make sense to consider air drops if day-light flights (and surface routes)had been completely ruled out, which is not yet the case; it is more efficient and economical to unload supplies on the ground and more can beprovided by that means than by air drops.   The advantageclaimed for air drops is that they circumvent the problemssurrounding the use of Uli, the Biafrans&apos; main link with the outside world and the Federal Governments main militarytarget.   However, the Federal Government&apos;s statement of 9December should have removed the main Biafran fears aboutUli; and many of the other obstacles to agreement on daylightflights would arise equally over air drops - in particular the Biafran demand for international guarantees, problemsover inspection before take-off, the Federal right to calldown aircraft for supplementary inspection on federal soil,the Biafran refusal to accept aircraft so inspected, and(from the Federal Government&apos;s point of view) the difficultyof preventing drops of. arms and ammunition mingled with therelief drops.31.     The Federal Government has reacted negatively tosoundings by the ICRC and the British High Commissioner aboutair drops.   Their attitude is that they have offered fair and effective arrangements for daylight flights; if the rebels, for their own military and political reasons, refuse- 15 -
to accept those offers, then they should take the con-sequences: there is no onus on Lagos to consider other proposals which are disadvantageous in Federal eyes to theFederal cause, as compared with daylight flights, whichbring no advantage or disadvantage to either side.Conclusions32.     Air drops might be regarded as a possible fall-backsolution in the event of daylight flights and surface routesbeing definitively ruled out.    Even then Federal agreement is unlikely.    If the agreement of both sides in such circumstances could be obtained, the Biafrans would belikelier to agree to air drops by the ICRC or uncommittedGovernments than by the RAF, in view of the allegedBiafran fear of British military intervention on theFederal Government&apos;s behalf under the guise of deliveringrelief supplies.- 16 -
F.     Helicopters operating from aircraft carriers33.     The idea of using helicopters (either from land &quot;bases orfrom carriers at sea) has also been considered several timesby H.M.G. and others.     An American &quot;Committee of Conscience&quot;headed by ex-Vice President Humphrey and Mrs. Martin Luther Kingput forward proposals on these lines in October v/hich werewelcomed by the Biafrans and castigated on Lagos radio.     Thisstimulated some renewed consideration of the proposal in response to a request by the Prime Minister, but the foreign and Commonwealth Office came to the conclusion that the political objections were likely to be overwhelming.     The U.S. government itself originally put the idea to both sides without any clearresult, and subsequently dropped it as costly and impracticable.On 9 December Sir A. Douglas Home put forward the same proposal as the main plank (with an initiative for a United Nations arms embargo) in the Opposition&apos;s policy on Nigeria.      Ministerspromised to examine the idea and there have been extensivespeculations in the press and an Early Day Motion in the Houseof Commons in support of it.     A statement of H.lv;.G&apos;conclusions as a result of their study of the proposals isexpected before the Christmas recess.Logistic considerations3U.     The Royal Navy could; provide a commando carrier,H.M.Sa Bulwark, for assistance with the task of relief duringthe period of two or three weeks from the middle of January1970.     With an augmented helicopter force of about 20 Wessex V:sshe could deliver about 500 tons of relief supplies intoBiafra within that timescale.- 17 -
35.     Although it would he mnst convenient for the ship to embark the relief supplies at Devonport she could probablyarrange to pick them up from Cotonou during her passage out to station off the Nigerian coast.      It would be necessary to divert a tanker to resupply the Bulwark and her aircraft withfuel during the course of the operation.36.     In Biafra an unloading area would need to be selected andmarked out.     This would call for the co-operation of theBiafrans and for the advance deployment of a small uniformedteam, with appropriate communications, from Bulwark who wouldtravel to the unloading point a day before the operation was dueto commence and remain there for its duration.37.     The helicopters would be operating at low level overterritory largely under the control of Federal Nigerian Forces.It would be a pre-requisite r*f the operation that both sidesshould agree to respect their neutrality and that effectiveorders should be given to ensure that there is no ground fireagainst the relief flights.38.     The effect of using Bulwark for this operation would be to delay, by a month, her arrival in Singapore, and she would misssome of the earlier stages leading up to Exercise Bersatu Padu.There would be some interference with helicopter work up and exercise programmes.   ,-39. The extra cost of providing this measure of reliefwould be  150-200,000.Political considerationskO,     The Federal Government have told Lord Carrington, theOpposition&apos;s emissary, that they are not prepared to entertainthe proposals for helicopters and carriers.      The Nigerians- 18 -
say that this (rr.v air drops) would be an affront to theirsovereignty which General G*won could not possibly contemplate:indeed a senior Nigerian official has said that if General Gowonwere to agree to a helicopter operation he would immediately beoverthrown.     The pros and cons are generally similar to thoseof air drops (i.e. avoidance of the problem of Uli, but most ofthe same other difficulties as those arising *ver daylightflights, such as Biafran demands for international guarantees,and problems on inspection and touch-down on federal territory).There is no more reason to expect these problems to be solved inthe context of helicopters than there has been so far in thatof daylight flights.     Moreover the fact that the helicopterswere coming from carriers in international waters makes thescheme politically more attractive t** the Biafrans (andcorrespondingly more objectionable to the Federal Government)in that the relief could be p6rtrayed as coming from outsidewithout any tangible collaboration or fiat from Lagos - thusapparently confirming that Biafra was effectively independent,and that starvation was being averted in spite of the federal government rather than because of them.ht.     As with an R.A.F. airlift or R.A.F. participation in airdrops, British participation in a helicopter and carrieroperation would probably be less acceptable to the Biafransthan that of other less committed Governments,  notably thatof the United States whose deeper involvement Colonel Ojukwuhas consistently sought.42.     Our consultations with the American, Canadian and DutchGovernments and with the I.C.R.C. show that they are all agreed that daylight flights are by far the best method of
delivery of supplies by air.      They point out that the cost perton delivered by helicopters from carriers would be colossal(according to the Americans,  1 million a week to deliverU00 tons a day plus  20 million for the purchase of helicoptersif specially acquired for this operation) and the amount whichcould be delivered by an exclusively British operation (500 tonsin 15 days) would only cover the I.C.R.C&apos;s immediate medicalneeds:    subsistence feeding alone would require the delivery of500 tons per day.     The American and Dutch Governments and theI.C.R.C. agree with our view that the chances of gettingagreement to the scheme are very slim.     The I.C.R.C. fear thatthe launching of such a scheme would have adverse effects onthe peace talks and on peace efforts and African public opiniongenerally.     Above all the I.C.R.G. and the other governments which we have, consulted fear that the launching of a new plan for&apos; using helicopters would distract attention from the realissue of daylight flights and provide an excuse for the Biafransto withhold their agreement from the I.G.R.C. plan for adaylight airlift which is preferable on all counts.k3.     The Canadians do not wish to be drawn into discussions on helicopters.     The Americans cannot agree to be publiclyquoted as being unwilling to join in such a scheme or ascondemning it as they are currently offering to discuss theidea with the Humphrey Committee.     Their public position isthat a helicopter scheme w*uld be an undertaking of greatmagnitude posing very seri^-s technical and political problems.The Dutch share eur view of the technical and financial difficulties.- 20 -
Conclusionskk.      The amount which could, he delivered by helicopters fromcarriers is so small compared with (a) the enormous,  costlyand elaborate effort involved,  and (b)  the amount which can hedelivered by daylight flights,  that such an operation is not worth further consideration except in the unlikely event of allother and preferable possibilities of delivering relief beingcompletely ruled out.      A British effort on its own would be unable to do anything like enough to make any perceptibleimpact on the need in Biafra.     American participation on ahuge scale would be an essential ingredient of a carrier/helicopter operation large enough to take in enough suppliesover a long enough period to make a real diffi.re.nce;  and theU.S. Government are not prepared to contemplate such an operation.      In any case, the political obstacles to securingthe agreement of the Federal Government to such an operationseem likely to be insuperable;  and the Biafrans would objectto British participation.- 21 -
General Conclusions and RecommendationsU-5 .    (1) The best way to get relief supplies into Biafrawould be by road or river.     But the political and militaryobstacles to agreement hitherto on any specific route or onthe conditions for neutralising.and policing it are likelyto continue to preclude agreement.(2) The next best method is daylight flights and the continuing effort of the I.C.R.C. to get agreement on these should be strongly supported as a main priority.     No effort should be spared to persuade Colonel Ojukwu to drop his demands and preconditions for daylight flights (and if he persists in them, to expose his responsibility for the consequences).(3) If a daylight airlift were to begin&apos; and becomeestablished, there might be a chance of agreement by colonel ojukwu to R.A.F. participation;    but he would be unlikely toagree to this at the outset, and anyway the need will be for money rather than aircraft or crews (and the number of aircraft which the two airfields can take is limited).(h) Other possibilities such as air drops or ahelicopter/carrier operation should be regarded as possible(but unlikely) fall-back solutions of last resort, to beconsidered only if and when all hope of daylight flights orsurface routes has been abandoned.     Any of these plans wouldencounter most of the same obstacles as now prevent daylightflights, and all of them would be much less efficient and effective.(5) R.A.P. or R .N.&apos; participation in any of thealternative schemes is unlikely to be acceptable in theirinitial stages;   but it might be possible later, if really
needed to supplement what is being done by the relieforganisations and subject to the operating limitations ofthe airfields.     However,  the most useful contribution which H.M.G. could make even if any of the schemes were to be putinto operation would probably be financial rather than bythe provision of aircraft, crews or carriers. -Foreign and Commonwealth Officeand Ministry of Defence.17 December, 1969.- 23 -
