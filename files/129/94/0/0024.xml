SECRET :THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1958C. (58) 174 Copy No. g 327th August, 1958CABINETICELANDIC FISHERY LIMITSMemorandum by the Minister of State for Foreign affairs in an effort to find a modus vivendi which would avoid a clash off Icelandon 1st September, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) last weekdiscussed a proposal under which Iceland would have obtained exclusive fishing rights off the north-west and south-west coasts in return for an understandingthat fishery limits would not be extended elsewhere. The idea had merits onconservation grounds, but it has been rejected by the Prime Minister of Icelandand his party (the Progressives).2. As an alternative, the Icelandic Foreign Minister has instructedMr. Andersen (the Icelandic representative in NATO), to arrange for the NATOSecretariat to put forward a formula under which Iceland would, in the shortterm, be content with a fishery limit of six miles while claiming twelve. In addition,three new base lines will be claimed by Iceland and possibly an area closed toall fishing as well. The Foreign Minister originally suggested to Mr. Gilchrist,our envoy at Reykjavik, that this new proposal should be linked to the UnitedStates proposal at the Geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea (i.e., six miles of territorial waters, plus six miles of exclusive fishery jurisdiction subject to the recognition of historic fishing rights). But in NATO, Mr. Andersen has said thatthere must be no reference to the United States proposal at Geneva.3. Meetings of experts took place in NATO on 25th and 26th August. Thedraft which emerged from their morning meeting on 26th August is at Annex A.It will have been subject to further discussion by the time this paper is taken by ministers.  Mr. Andersen will in particular try to secure the deletion of Article 3.4. Even if Ministers agree to the formula at Annex A, its acceptance bythe Icelandic Government would still be in doubt. The Communists in Icelandhave threatened to leave the Government Coalition if any foreign trawlers are allowed to fish within twelve miles. Their resignation would probably force ageneral election in which the Communists would probably win additional seats.The Prime Minister may be unwilling to run this risk.5. M. Spaak, the Secretary-General of NATO, is anxious that some modus vivendi should be found to avoid a clash inside NATO, and this view is shared byother NATO Governments, especially by the United States, Canada and FederalGermany. Dr. Adenauer, Chancellor of Federal Germany, fears that a clash between the Royal Navy and Icelandic coastguard vessels might strengthenneutralist and pro-Soviet tendencies in Iceland and perhaps lead to the defectionof Iceland from NATO. This would, of course, be a severe blow to NATO as awhole. Moreover, the defection of Iceland would make it impossible to control the access of Soviet submarines to the North Atlantic.6. If the Icelandic Government refuse to come to a modus vivendi before 1st September, a public statement by Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be required.A draft is at Annex B.A. N.Foreign Office, SW.1,26th August, 1958.54026
Annex ADRAFT AGREEMENT DISCUSSED IN NATO ON 26th AUGUST, 1958(Text received by telephone.   Not authentic.   The Secretariat will not have theauthentic text ready until 11 am. 27th August, 1958)ICELANDIC FISHERY limits the Governments of .....................................................................,recognising the exceptional character of the Icelandic economy, which isoverwhelmingly dependent upon the coastal fisheries for the livelihood of thepeople,bearing in mind also the Resolution on Special Situations Relating to CoastalFisheries (A/CONF.13/L.56) adopted at Geneva on 26th April, 1958, at theUnited Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea,recognising that the United Nations may in the near future convene a SecondInternational Conference to consider inter alia the extent of fishery limits,[hoping that an overall solution resolving existing differences of view on thismatter will be found]and desiring to conclude a temporary Agreement for the regulation of fishingaround the coasts of Iceland pending the conclusion of a further general convention on the Law of the Sea, have agreed as follows:  Article 1The Governments of ............................................. undertake that, asfrom 1st September, 1958, they will recognise that the area six miles in breadth asdelimited in the attached map shall be reserved exclusively for Icelandic fishing[on the understanding however that within this area no trawling or Danish seinenetting will be allowed].[Note. The United Kingdom representative at these meetings said that he wished to retain in this Article a reference to &quot; areas of the high seas which liebeyond three and within six miles of the coast of Iceland as delimited in theattached map.&quot; The German representative suggested the inclusion of a referenceto &quot; areas of the high seas outside the territorial sea and within six miles.&quot;]Article 2The Government of Iceland undertake that, for the duration of the present agreement, they will take no measures to prevent the vessels referred to in Article 1from fishing within those further areas of the high seas which lie between the sixmile limit referred to in Article 1 and a limit of twelve miles similarly measuredfrom the coasts of Iceland.Article 3[Nothing in the present Agreement shall be deemed to prejudice the views heldby any of the contracting Governments as to the limits in international law of territorial waters or of exclusive jurisdiction in fishery matters.][Note. The Icelandic representative pressed for the omission of this Article.The United Kingdom and German representatives insisted on its retention. the icelandic representative argued that the inclusion in the preamble of the clause in square brackets would justify the omission of this Article. This argument doesnot satisfy the Foreign Office legal advisers.]
SECRET,3i V &quot;T        &apos;.- r.-,A\rUele&apos;4-c^ !;;-.-v v-/:V. -&quot;     v&apos;The present Agreement shall remain in force until the conclusion of a furtherG eneral Convention on the Law of the Sea. &apos;    - -[Note. Two alternative versions of this Article were proposed. The first,put forward by the Secretariat after discussion with the United&quot; kingdom representative, read as follows:  &quot; Unless a further General Convention on the Law of the Sea is concludedwithin a period of three years, the parties agree to meet together to review thepresent Agreement on the basis of the situation existing at the time of itstermination.&quot;The second alternative was proposed by the French representative. It read as follows:  &quot; Si aucune convention generate n&apos;intervient avant 1&apos;expiration de trois ans,les parties s&apos;engagent a proceder a de nouvelles negotiations pour laprolongation de cet accord, soit dans sa version actuelle, soit dans une formeamendee.&quot; (If no general convention has been achieved before the expiry of three years, the parties undertake to enter into new negotiations for the prolongation of this agreement, either in its present form, or in an amendedform.)]Annex draft OF A STATEMENT TO BE ISSUED IF NO MODUS VIVENDI WITHICELAND IS REACHEDICELANDIC FISHERY limits the views of Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom concerningthe decision of the Government of Iceland to extend Icelandic fishery limits to twelve miles were set out in a statement published on June 4,1958.2. Since that date, Her Majesty&apos;s Government and a number of otherGovernments concerned have made prolonged efforts to secure by negotiation anagreement which would safeguard the future of the fisheries around Iceland and take account of Iceland&apos;s dependence on these fisheries.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious that the unilateral action proposedby the Icelandic Government should not prejudice the prospects for the holding of a second conference on the Law of the Sea to deal with the questions leftunresolved by the conference held at Geneva earlier this year, in particular the breadth of territorial waters and fishery limits. For this purpose, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment were prepared, and remain prepared, to negotiate an interim arrangement until another conference on the Law of the Sea can be arranged.4. In the discussions which have taken place since the Icelandic government announced their intention of extending their fishery limits, two alternative interim arrangements have been suggested. The first would have involved a series of measures which would have ensured an adequate share of the total catch aroundIceland for Icelandic fishermen. The measures would have included the reservation of important areas for small-boat fishing, and a limitation on the total catch in the waters around Iceland. Such arrangements would have contributed to the conservation of the fish stocks. The second alternative was that Icelandic fishery limits should be extended to six miles, with the possibility of certain adjustments in Iceland&apos;s favour.5. The Icelandic Government have not yet agreed to enter into these or anyother interim arrangements.
[6. To show their good will and their appreciation of the special position of iceland, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have requested the owners and skippers ofBritish fishing vessels not to fish within six miles of the Icelandic coast until someinterim or lasting arrangement has been concluded.l,7. Her Majesty&apos;s Government cannot, however, agree that the icelandic government have the right to arrest the fishing vessels of other nations on the high seas, in&apos; pursuance of fishery regulations unilaterally adopted and not recognised as legal by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. They have therefore arranged to stationFishery Protection Vessels of the Royal Navy off the coast of Iceland to protectagainst arrest any British vessels fishing between six and twelve miles. these arrangements will not lead to any clashes unless the Icelandic Government instruct their coastguard vessels to arrest British fishing vessels on the high seas. In theview of Her Majesty&apos;s Government, the issue of such instructions would be incompatible with international law.8. Her Majesty&apos;s Government remain anxious that the Icelandic Governmentshould agree to negotiate an interim arrangement which would eliminate allpossibility of incidents until the whole question of the breadth of territorial waters and fishery limits can be dealt with at a further conference on the Law of the Sea.
