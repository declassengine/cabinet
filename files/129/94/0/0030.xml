l SECRET , &quot;    IgO(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0 C(58) 180 COPY NO.5th September, 1958CABINETSALARIES OF SCOTTISH TEACHERSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in his memorandum, C. (58) 177, the Secretary of State puts thecase for accepting the recommendation made to him by the national joint Council to deal with salaries for teachers in Scotland that teachers&apos;salaries should be increased forthwith by 5 per cent because of the risein the cost of living since the last revision of Scottish teachers&apos; pay scalesin November, 1956.   He wishes to do this mainly on the grounds that:-(a) the recommendation has reached him after the reference toarbiters provided for under the constitution of the National Joint Councilif the teachers&apos; panel and employers&apos; panel cannot put forward an agreedmajority recommendation (as they could not on this occasion);(b) it relates to an increase in the cost of living which has already taken place and, as stated in Appendix A to C. (58) 125, such interimincreases have been given in the past during the triennial cycle which isthe normal period for the review of teachers&apos; salaries.2.     Acceptance of the recommendation will, at the very least, in itselfinvolve a considerable increase in expenditure at a time when we are trying to reduce it by economies.   The Secretary of State recognises thatif the Bumham Committee employers&apos; panel rejects the substantial30 per cent claim now lodged, they would find it difficult not to make acorresponding offer to English teachers of a 5 per cent cost of livingincrease.   It seems to be inevitable that a counter offer of this nature would be made and in all probability it would be accepted.   The cost wouldbe  12 millions in a full year, of which just over  7 millions would fallon the Exchequer.   A supplementary estimate of half the latter sum wouldbe required by the Ministry this year.   And, in that event, under Section69(l)(c) of the Education (Scotland). Act, 1946, supplementary provisionof about S.\ million would have to be automatically voted for Scotlandand spent on other educational services even though, as the Secretaryof State says in paragraph 4 of C. (58) 177, he already has the necessary funds to meet the cost of a half year&apos;s grant on this award.3.     The immediate financial consequence is a matter of fact.   one can only conjecture what the indirect consequences might be, but I mustdraw attention to the following possibilities:--1-
(a) I have recently refused the Minister of Health&apos;s request that a second interim increase be given to doctors and dentists withinthe National Health Service.   The last major revision of doctors&apos;and dentists&apos; remuneration was in 1952 for general practitioners and1954 for hospital staffs.  After a 24 per cent claim had been submittedby the British Medical Association in June, 1956, the Royal Commissionon Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Remuneration was set up in March, 1957.In May, 1957 an interim increase of 5 per cent (10 per cent to juniorhospital staffs) was granted pending the findings of the Royal Commission.The claim was subsequently increased to a total of 29 per cent and asecond interim increase was requested in June this year.   The cost ofa second interim increase of 5 per cent would be about  6 millions for Great Britain, all of which would fall on the Exchequer.   The Ministerof Health has already warned me that, though he has accepted my rejection of a second interim increase for the time being, he will find if difficultto continue to maintain that position.   The approval of an interim costof living increase for teachers, within the triennial cycle of their majorsalary reviews, the last of which dates from November, 1956 only, willadd substantially to our difficulties in rejecting another approach fromthe British Medical Association for a second interim increase for doctors who since their settlements in 1952 and 1954 have had no more than the5 per cent increase given in 1957.(b) The teachers have always been regarded as an occupationwith which the middle ranks of the Civil Service can be compared. A5 per cent advance by teachers will add to the difficulties of resistinga claim by the Civil Service for a further general increase of the type theysecured in July, 1957.(c) Salaries in the university field (last increased in August, 1957because of increases in comparable fields including teachers) are alsosensitive to movements in teachers&apos; pay.(d) A considerable number of classes of staff in the national health Service, with current salary scales dating from the end of 1956or the beginning of 1957, have recently put in, or are about to put in,new pay claims.   These would be all the more difficult to resist ifteachers&apos; pay were increased by 5 per cent.(e) It may be that the teachers&apos; increase can be differentiated from industrial wage claims, though even in this field acceptance of this awardwill increase our difficulties.4.      The indirect consequnces of accepting the Secretary of State&apos;proposal may therefore be considerable.5.     I am bound also to argue that on merits the settlement proposedis unjustified.   It is not an acceptable principle that increases in the costof living should of themselves justify immediate increases in the salaries of professional and executive grades at short intervals: they should be absorbed in the normal cyclical review of salaries where such exists.Teachers&apos; emoluments range from  475 to about  2,500 for the headmastersof large schools.   Except at the very beginning of their careers therefore,teachers earn more than the average wage and should be able to carryminor changes in the cost of living.   The teachers&apos; normal triennial reviewrelates to dates which have been April, 1945, 1948, 1951, 1954 and 1957(theoretically).   On the last occasion the review, which was generally
admitted to be generous, was advanced to October (England and Wales)and November (Scotland) 1956 to deal with the difficulties caused bythe increased superannuation contributions required by the TeachersSuperannuation Act, 1956.   Nevertheless, it was stated by both ministers at the time of the 1956 review that that settlement should run for thenormal period of three years unless there was a major change in circumstances.   I am aware that interim increases on cost of livinggrounds have been given in the past, once in August 1952, and again in Scotland only in April, 1956.   But in 1952 the cost of living had risen by some 13 per cent since the triennial review of April, 1951, and itwas deemed to justify an immediate increase of 6 per cent in salaryscales.   The 7 per cent interim increase of April, 1956 was givenagainst an increase in the cost of living of 11 per cent between April, 1954and that date.   There has been no such sharp increase on this occasion:the cost of living rose by 6 per cent only between July, 1956 and march, 1958 - the period on which the Scottish teachers&apos; found their claim.6.     I do not think we should accept the argument that because interimincreases have been approved in the past we must continue to acquiesce in them, when the rise in the cost of living is far from severe and at atime when we are striving to moderate increases in wages and salaries.7.      For all these reasons I felt bound to ask the Secretary of state to bring his proposal before the Cabinet.   The alternative policiesare to postpone or reject the recommendation.8,     I see the force of the Secretary of State&apos;s arguments against usinghis powers so as to delay the implementation of the recommendation fora short period, say to 1st April, 1959.   It is true that such defermentwould save about  4 millions on the education grant for this year (on theassumption that the English teachers are granted a similar increase)and would go some way towards postponing the repercussions in paragraph 2.It would, however, be in some ways as difficult as more radical action,and it would mean acquiescing in an unjustifiable anticipation of theperiodic review of teachers&apos; salaries.9.     The alternative is a rejection of the recommendations, with astatement to the effect that the findings of the arbitrators and the viewsof the Council will be taken into account at the next triennial review.   i recognise that the refusal to implement a recommendation - based onarbitral findings - would be a dfficult matter, but though difficult it wouldbe far less damaging than the consequences of acquiescence.10.    The particular circumstances distinguish this case from normalarbitration cases and protect us, if we reject the recommendation, from the accusation that we are sabotaging the sanctity of arbitration.   In the firstplace this arbitration determines not what the pay should be but whatrecommendation should be made by the parties to the Secretary of State whois the final statutory authority.   The Secretary of State himself is not a party to the dispute on which the arbitration has taken place.   There isalso the fact that the existing settlement was accompanied by a cleardeclaration by the Government as to its duration and the circumstances in which alone the Government would approve a departure.   Lastly there-3-
is the fact that the Secretary of State warned both parties in advance that he did not consider that a major change in circumstances had takenplace and that a new settlement ought to await the normal three yearreview.I understand that neither the Governments declaration in 1956nor the Secretary of State&apos;s letter to the parties was brought to theattention of the arbiters, who did not therefore have the wider considerations before them.   This materially reduces the sanctitywhich need be attached to their decision.li.     I consider therefore that it is essential that the Secretary ofState should stand on his statutory responsibility to exercise his discretion not to approve the recommendation - onfche grounds that circumstances do not measure up to the major change which Ministersindicated at the time of the November 1956 settlement would be requiredto justify any change in Scottish Teachers&apos; salary scales before 1st April, 1960.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.5th September, 1958
