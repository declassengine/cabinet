SECRET.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1958C. (58) 158 Copy No.   5g18th July, 1958    &apos; - -    . .CABINETHOSPITALSMemorandum by the Minister of health i have read with interest the memoranda C. (58) 148, C. (58) 149 andC. (58) 153 of the Minister of Education and the Secretary of State for Scotland,in which they propose to increase capital expenditure on secondary and primary schools and on the expansion of training colleges.2. I have, of course, no wish to criticise these proposals as such. But, in viewof the limitations of capital investment, it would be unrealistic to ignore the factthat rapid expansion in one social service may prejudice the proper aspirations of another; and I must point out that hospital building has a major claim, widely recognised and long deferred, on available resources.3. The sums available for hospital capital works in England and Wales didnot exceed  10 millions in any year from 1948-49 to 1955-56, with  13 millions in1956-57,  18 millions in 1957-58 and  20 millions for the current year, and 22 millions has been provisionally agreed for 1959-60. This is inadequate tomeet the need of the hospital service. No survey of the complete need for capitalexpenditure has been made, but these amounts fall far short of whatwouldbe requiredin order to complete all the new hospitals for which there is a strong case and toimprove those which require improvement. The Guillebaud Committee of enquiry into the Cost of the National Health Service recommended that &quot; having regardto the advanced degree of obsolescence of many hospitals in this country, and tothe very large arrears resulting from the virtual cessation of hospital building since1938 ..... 30 millions annually would be a desirable rate of capital expenditure for the National Health Service at which to aim over the seven years succeedingthe year 1957-58.&quot; This figure, which of course has never been attained, hasalready been overtaken by the further need for capital development arising from further arrears and from the Report of the McNair Committee for an increase inthe intake of dental students.4. Part of the Minister of Education^ proposals aim at the replacement of unsatisfactory existing buildings. In the hospital service there are a very largenumber of buildings which similarly ought to be replaced. More than 300 hospitalsare more than 100 years old, nearly 1,200 more than 50 years old, many of themquite unsuited to modern forms of treatment. They include, particularly amongthe mental hospitals, many buildings which, despite such modernisation as hasbeen possible within our small capital programme, are really a scandal in the modern world. As yet no new hospital has been completed in England and Walessince the war. But there are areas in which entirely new hospitals should beprovided, and in some of the New Towns in particular there is no hospital.5. In the considerable publicity which has been given to the tenth anniversary of the start of the Health Service, with its mixture of praise and blame, criticism of the capital provision for hospital building has been strong and unanimous. TheMinister of Education is rightly anxious to gain the confidence of the educationalworld. The scale of provision for hospitals to date cannot command the confidence of the medical world or of the public as a whole.53757secret&apos;
secrW-6.  I have asked, in my investment submission to the Treasury, for  27 millions for 1959-60,  31 millions for 1960-61 and  34 millions for 1961-62.7. But a programme for the longest possible period ahead is just as necessaryfor hospitals as for schools if hospital authorities are to be able to plan theirdevelopments on sound lines. I appreciate that the Cabinet cannot reach conclusions about the level of investment until they have an opportunity of studying- the. results of the review mentioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his,memorandum C. (58) 152. I would, however, point out that the announcementof a decision to complete more schools, and also to improve or replace out-of-dateschools, which was not accompanied by a decision similarly to expand the hospitalcapital programme would lead to very considerable public and political criticism which I do not think we could easily defend.D. W.-S.Ministry of Health, W. I,17th July, 1958.
