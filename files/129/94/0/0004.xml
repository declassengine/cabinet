CONFIDENTIALDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1958C. (58) 154 Copy No. 5 917th July, 1958CABINETCOMPENSATION FOR COMPULSORY ACQUISITION OF land memorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the Minister of Housing in C. (58) 151 seeks Cabinet approval for the inclusion in next session&apos;s programme of a Bill to change the basis of compensation for compulsory acquisition of land. I do not dissent in principle from the proposed new basis, and further study of its application to Glasgow overspill andredevelopment operations has somewhat relieved my fears of criticism in thatcontext.2. I am however not yet fully convinced of the political wisdom of legislatingin this sense at present. We shall, of course, be attacked for what will berepresented as conferring a benefit on landowners at the public cost. What is perhaps more serious, we shall be in real danger of provoking a Labourdeclaration not only to reverse the change at the first opportunity, but alsopossibly to go further and undo the freedom which the 1954 settlement conferred on the private market in land.3. No doubt because the private market in land is less active in Scotlandthan in England and Wales and the difference between the two price levelsconsequently less marked, there is among Scottish Backbenchers little pressure for, and even some opposition to, legislation at this time. But should the cabinet decide to legislate next session, it will be essential that the new basis should apply in Scotland as well as in England and Wales. In that event I very much hope thata single Great Britain Bill will prove practicable, and the work of drafting is proceeding with this in view.J. S.
