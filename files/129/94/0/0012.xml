SECRET - g5(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 162 COPY NO. S S21st July, 1958CABINETTERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Minister of defence i have seen the Lord Chancellor^ paper (C.(58) 156) recommendingan international conference tc secure agreement   on a six-mile limit forterritorial waters.2.        I fully understand the disadvantages of leaving things in a state of uncertainty.   Nevertheless, I must point out that if a conference extendedterritorial waters to six miles, without at the same time establishing theright of innocent passage for military aircraft over the three to six-milezone, we should be faced with the grave strategic consequences set out below.(a) Our military aircraft would be unable to fly into Gibraltar from the atlantic, and vice versa.; without Spanish or Moroccan consent.   This might make it impossible to use Gibraltar as a base for operating maritimeaircraft in the Atlantic, or as a staging post between the United Kingdom andthe Trans-African air route which in future may well become our only saferoute to the Arabian Peninsula and the Far East.(b) Our military aircraft could not fly into Singapore, except with the permission of the Malayan or Indonesian Governments.   The Indonesian government would almost certainly be obstructive;  and, although Malayais at present co-operative, it is quite possible that she will sooner or lateradopt a policy of neutralism.(c) Access by air to Hong Kong would be awkward and sometimesdangerous, without overflying Chinese territorial waters.3.        The Lord Chancellor has suggested that we should seek thenecessary overflying rights by negotiating bilateral agreements.   But,having once agreed at an international conference to a six-mile territorial sea, we should have hopelessly prejudiced our position.   It is no goodimagining that Spain would be ready to help us at Gibraltar, Indonesia at singapore, or Communist China at Hong Kong.4.        I wonder, therefore, whether it would be possible, in convening theproposed conference, to restrict its terms of reference to the problems con-cerned with the use of the sea and to exclude the problems of the use of theair space above it.   If this course is not thought practical, I would preferthere to be no conference and no agreement at all, thus leaving us free todispute the right of other countries to extend their territorial waters byunilateral decision, as we have recently done in the case of Iceland.D.S.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1.21st July, 1958
