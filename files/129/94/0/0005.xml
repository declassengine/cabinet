THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1958The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited. It is issued for the personal use of.............................. .............. ..............TOP SECRET Copy No.C. (58) 15518th July, 1958CABINETLEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME: 1958-59 session memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy seal the Cabinet will wish to be informed of the progress made in the formulation of the legislative programme for the 1958-59 session since their last discussion(C.C. (58) 29th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. For convenience of reference the classified list of Bills which the Cabinetthen considered is annexed to this memorandum. In the light of subsequentdevelopments, the list should be amended as follows:  (a) List A.1 should include a Bill amending the Representation of the PeopleAct as regards the use of cars to take voters to the poll.(b) In List A.2 the Reserve Forces Bill (from List C) may need to besubstituted for the Bill to extend the Navy, Army and Air ForceReserves Act, 1954; and provision should be made for a Bill to extenddiplomatic privileges and immunities to a representative of Euratomin this country.(c) List B.2 should include:  As New Items(i) Assistance to small farmers.(ii) Assistance towards house purchase.(iii) Increased grant-aid to denominational schools.On Promotion from List C(i) Affiliation Orders (Enforcement in the Commonwealth).(ii) Visiting Forces Act (Amendment).(iii) Rights of Light (War-damaged Sites).(iv) International Road Transport.(v) Hire Purchase Registration.3. After a further review of the prospects the Future Legislation Committeeare satisfied that all the Bills in List A.1 must be accepted as essential, and I invitethe Cabinet formally to approve their inclusion in the programme. Reasonableprogress is being made in the preparation of these Bills.4. It is, of course, impossible as yet to determine the final selection ofContingent Bills (List A.2) which will need to be included. The Cabinet havealready decided, however, not to introduce legislation on industrial arbitration and53751
immigration; and, on present information, it seems probable that the following bills will also not be required:  Malta.Ceylon (Consequential Provisions).Blackbushe Aerodrome (Common Rights).Public Works Loans.The remaining Bills in List A.2 are under consideration or must await laterdevelopments.5. Of the five main Bills in List B.1, it is now agreed in principle that thosedealing with:  (i) Mental Care and Treatment,(ii) Factories,(iii) National Insurance (the new pensions scheme),should be included in the programme. The Bills on:  (iv) Compensation for Compulsory Acquisition of Land,(v) Economic Controls,are awaiting a decision of policy by the Cabinet. The Ministers concerned hope tobe able to submit proposals before the recess.6. Unless any of the Bills in paragraph 5 is finally rejected, it will be difficultto find time for many of the &quot; other programme Bills &quot; in List B.2. It seems most unlikely in any event that it will be appropriate to proceed with any of thefollowing:  (i) Colonial Loans Guarantee (unless it can be combined with the colonial development and Welfare Bill in List A.1).(ii) Consular Conventions (Anglo-Italian).(iii) Medical Auxiliaries.(iv) Matrimonial Proceedings in Magistrates&apos; Courts.(v) Family Allowances and National Insurance.  (A Franks Committee Bill:not the projected Bill on major pensions policy.)(vi) Minicoy Lighthouse.I suggest, therefore, that the Cabinet might now decide that none of the Billsmentioned so far in this paragraph should be included in the programme for next session. The Ministry of Supply Act, 1939 (Amendment) Bill and, temporarily,the Credit Trading Bill can be dealt with in the Economic Controls Bill. MeanwhileI will reserve my position on the possibility of a joint Criminal Justice andMagistrates&apos; Courts Bill.7.   There remain the Bills on:  (i) New Towns      1 To which the Cabinet have already decided to give(ii) Wages Councils J   priority.(iii) Assistance to small farmers (to which we are committed).(iv) Assistance towards house purchase.(v) Increased grant-aid for denominational schools (which the Minister ofEducation hopes to submit to the Cabinet before the end of July).(vi) Licensing and insurance of nuclear reactors.(vii) Deer (Scotland).(viii) Building legislation (Scotland),(ix) The Wolfenden Report.8. In deciding how many of these Bills we will include in the programme wemust bear in mind that:  (a) It will be desirable to reduce, if possible, the demands on our supporters inthe last full session of the present Parliament.(b) Even a programme confined to the Bills in Lists A.1, A.2 and B.1 mayexhaust practically the whole of the legislative time likely to be available and may leave little, if any, margin for emergencies in the form oflegislation, debates, &amp;c, which are unforeseeable at present but maysuddenly emerge as essential.
9.   I invite the Cabinet, therefore, to decide that:(1) On the assumption that all the five Bills in List B.1 are adopted, onlythe first six Bills in paragraph 7 should be regarded, at this stage, aspotential additional candidates. The final decision on their inclusion in the programme must be deferred until later. (This would not preclude the inclusion of the Deer (Scotland) and Building Legislation (Scotland)Bills, provided that these can be dealt with, at all stages, in the ScottishGrand Committee.)(2) The responsible Ministers should now seek policy clearance, where necessary, for these Bills and issue drafting instructions as rapidly aspossible.(3) A programme consisting of the five major Bills in List B.1 together withsuch of the other six Bills as we can accommodate will constitute animaginative and politically acceptable indication of the Governmentsforward policy.R.
