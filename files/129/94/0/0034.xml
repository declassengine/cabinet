(58) 184 Copy No.   649th September, 1958CABINETEUROPEAN FREE TRADE AREADEFINITION OF ORIGIN-TEXTILESNote by the Paymaster GeneralThe attached paper by officials sets out the details of what is a particularly difficult problem. There is a conflict of interest between the United kingdom industry and the interest of the Commonwealth. It is clearly impossible to satisfyboth sides, and, whatever the solution finally achieved, it is likely to causedissatisfaction to both. In the circumstances I have felt that we ourselves shouldtake the initiative in this matter as little as possible, because the more the final solution appears to have been forced upon us the better.2. I agree with the general line proposed by officials and I ask my colleagues to endorse it. There may perhaps be advantage in pointing out that whatever is decided at this stage about textiles need not be the final and lasting solution. Weare hoping to check the import of Asiatic grey cloth into this country and while weare doing so it would seem foolish to encourage the import of Continental goodsmade up from Asiatic greys. But the check is presumably only a temporary one,and if, as seems logical, our long-term policy must be to permit the import of Asiaticgreys and for the British industry to concentrate more on the more specialisedprocesses, it is clear that, in the long run, it will be of interest to the UnitedKingdom to have the maximum freedom of trade in articles so produced.R. M.Office of the Paymaster General, S.W. 1,8th September, 1958.54014a
DEFINITION OF ORIGIN : TEXTILESIn the Free Trade Area negotiations on origin, a particular problem arises inconnection with textiles (including clothing) where there is a sharp conflict of interestsof the United Kingdom industry and the Commonwealth. This conflict must be resolved if our negotiators in Paris are to be placed in a position to reach agreement on origin rules for textiles in the Free Trade Area. The first stage is to decide whatis likely to be the best line of compromise and this would then have to be discussed with the United Kingdom industry and with the Commonwealth: we are committed to discuss the problem with the United Kingdom industry before reaching final agreement in Paris and with the Commonwealth before making any major change inour existing policies.Views of the United Kingdom industry. In the course of the Free Trade Area negotiations, the United Kingdom has proposed the extension to textiles of the same general rule proposed for all other products that if not less than half the value has been added within the Area, that should be enough to confer Free Trade Area origin for tariff purposes.3. There is, however, exceptionally strong opposition to the adoption of sucha rule both from the United Kingdom industry and from certain Governments,notably France and Italy. Their main fears are that cheap Asian textiles particularlygrey cloth, will be able to qualify under the origin rules after processing in europe and in that way the European textile industries, particularly spinning and weaving,would be very seriously damaged. To avoid any risk of this happening, the industry has proposed the adoption of a highly restrictive definition of origin, commonlyreferred to as the &quot; cumulative process rule.&quot; Under this no textile article wouldqualify for Free Trade Area treatment unless all the manufacturing processes hadbeen carried out within the Area right from the fibre stage to the finished garment.Deputations from the textile industry have urged the President of the Board of Tradeand the Paymaster General to accept their proposal. Ministers have replied that theGovernment could not, at least during the early stages of the negotiations, agree to drop the 50 per cent, rule for textiles. In declining to accept the textile industries&apos;proposals at the time they were submitted, Ministers did not exclude the possibilityof a change of policy later in the negotiations involving United Kingdom acceptanceof more restrictive rules. No undertaking was, however, given that we should be willing or able to go as far as the industry wanted.The Scope for a Compromise Proposal4. The Paris negotiations have now reached the point where it is clear that itwould be very difficult to secure international agreement to the 50 per cent, rule fortextiles.5. We think that agreement could be reached in the negotiations on an originrule for textiles based on process definition to the exclusion of a percentage criterion.The &quot; cumulative process rule &quot; would, however, be subject to various difficulties and objections. It would not be negotiable in Paris without seriously prejudicingour stand for reasonably liberal origin rules in other sectors. There would be very strong opposition to such an extreme proposition from Switzerland, and possiblyother more liberally-minded countries, who have supported us throughout the origindiscussions. Further, such a proposal would almost certainly be against thelong-term interests of the United Kingdom; its restrictiveness would provide additional scope for administrative protection against United Kingdom exports andwould thus put our trade at a disadvantage in the markets of the Six, since no originrules will inhibit trade between the Treaty of Rome countries.6. Moreover, the textile exporting Commonwealth countries (India, pakistan and Hong Kong and, for rayon, Canada) have a material interest in seeing that the origin rules for textiles are kept as liberal as possible in order that the Free trade area as a whole, and the United Kingdom in particular, should be as large a market
for their semi-finished products as possible. The cumulative process rule wouldbe open to strong objection from the Commonwealth because it would excludetotally goods made from Commonwealth textile products from the benefits of a free trade Area, and would be likely to introduce a restrictive pattern into the Free trade area generally.Possible Compromise Proposals: Formula &quot; A &quot;7. A formula which is not as restrictive as that put forward by the UnitedKingdom industry would be as follows:  The performance within the Area (which is defined as excluding colonies)of any two of the four main processes (spinning, weaving, finishing and making-up), should be enough to confer Area origin, except that for made-upgoods three processes would be required and for yarn only one. In other words,to qualify for Free Trade Area tariff treatment: -Yarn must be spun in the Area.Grey cloth must be spun and woven in the Area.Finished cloth must be woven and finished in the Area.Made-up goods (e.g., sheets, garments) must be woven, finished and made-up in the Area.For ease of reference this formula is called Formula &quot; A.&quot;8. It is not possible to compare the effect of Formula &quot; A &quot; precisely with theother formulae considered above. It is less restrictive than the United kingdom industry&apos;s proposal because it permits the use of non-Area yarn in making finishedcloth and made-up goods. The industry will almost certainly protest in the firstinstance, but, if they are carefully handled, the majority in the industry can probably be persuaded to acquiesce in the end in the adoption of Formula &quot;A&quot;;but there will inevitably be dissentients, including notably the spinners. On theother hand, Formula &quot; A &quot; is likely nearly always to be more restrictive than the50 per cent, rule and much more restrictive for garments. In particular it willexclude from Free Trade Area tariff treatment all non-Area grey cloth, no matterhow much value may have been added by finishing and making-up in the Area. Itis, therefore, likely to be unwelcome to Asian textile producing countries and inparticular to India, Pakistan and Hong Kong.9. The main arguments for accepting Formula &quot; A &quot; as a basis for discussionwith the Commonwealth and the industry are:  (a) It would go a long way towards meeting the views of the United kingdom industry and breaking their united front of strong opposition toGovernment policy. The Board of Trade believe that any less restrictiveformula would leave the Government faced with the united opposition of the industry.(b) Whereas it would clearly have been very difficult to negotiate the 50 percent, rule, there is a reasonably good chance that something on thelines of this formula might be agreed in Paris during the sector-by-sector consideration of origin rules.(c) The Board of Trade consider that Free Trade Area origin rules shouldtake fully into account the implications of the voluntary agreementsnow under negotiation for the restriction of United Kingdom imports into the home market of Commonwealth cotton cloth and made-upgoods. The United Kingdom making-up industry might claim that itwould be inequitable to accept duty-free imports of European garmentsmade from Commonwealth cloth when their own supplies of such clothwere limited, and direct imports of made-up goods from theCommonwealth were also limited. The Commonwealth relations office and the Colonial Office consider this argument to be out of place(see 12 (v) below).Possible Compromise Proposals: Formula &quot; B &quot;10. Consideration has also been given to another compromise formula,referred to elsewhere in this paper as Formula &quot; B.&quot; This would be identical withFormula &quot; A &quot; for yarn, grey cloth and finished cloth, but for made-up goods thenormal qualification would be more liberal: made-up goods should qualify if they
have been finished and made-up in the Area, the only exception being that simplemade-up products, such as sheets and towels, where little value is added by thefinishing and making-up process, would be subject to the three-process rule as inFormula &quot; A.&quot;11. The essential difference between the two formulae is that, underFormula &quot; B,&quot; nearly all garments would qualify if made from non-Area grey cloth,whereas, under Formula &quot; A,&quot; all made-up goods, whether garments or householdtextiles, would have to be woven in the Area.12. The arguments which have been put forward in favour of Formula &quot; B &quot;and against Formula &quot; A &quot; are:  (i) Formula &quot; A &quot; represents a greater departure from our hitherto liberalapproach to the definition of origin and the Commonwealth may argue that it is not consistent with the concept of an &quot; outward-looking &quot; free trade Area which we have so far been advocating.(ii) The Commonwealth hoped that the loss of Preference  and  newdiscrimination which are inevitable in a Free Trade Area would be offset by their having a better market for their materials and semi-manufactures. They will claim that Formula &quot; A &quot; would deny them thepossibility of making such a gain on cotton cloth. (In fact, whatever therules of origin, there never was any great possibility that a substantialtrade would develop in Europe in processed Asian cloth. Inter-industryarrangements limit some of it at present, and it is probably inevitable that either similar arrangements or Government action would prevent any substantial development of it in future. It can therefore be claimedin discussion with the Commonwealth that Formula &quot; A &quot; would notalter the situation very much one way or the other.)(iii) The margin of preference on cotton textiles is guaranteed to India, and though the loss of this preference in itself is unlikely to damage Indianinterests (since any increased imports into the United Kingdom from europe will be likely to be at the expense of Lancashire), the more restrictive the rule of origin the greater the price we shall have to pay inrenegotiation of our contractual preferences.(iv) The Government of Hong Kong attach importance to the fact thatEuropean liberalisation is extended to her, and the rules of originapplied in connection with it are relatively liberal. They fear that lessliberal rules of origin for tariff purposes in the Free Trade Area might also be adopted for quantitative restriction purposes, and be applied in determining whether direct imports are of Hong Kong origin.Although we have told the Hong Kong Government that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment take the view that nothing should be done in the free trade Area which would constitute a backward move from the present organisation for European Economic Co-operation practice, thetendency to assimilate the rules for tariff and quantitative restrictionpurposes will probably be increased by the adoption ofFormula &quot; A.&quot;(v) The point at (c) in paragraph 9 above is open to the counter-argument that the arrangements now under negotiation with the Commonwealthare for three years only to permit adjustment, and that during thatperiod the duty changes will hardly be great enough to affect the issue.During that period, no question arises of duty-free competition fromgoods made up on the Continent from Commonwealth cloth.(vi) Any Free Trade Area proposal felt to be damaging to the textile interestsof India, Pakistan and Hong Kong might prejudice either the reachingof a voluntary agreement or the willingness of the industries of thosecountries to work any agreement when reached. The Governor of hong Kong considers that, if it became known that we were supportingFormula &quot; A,&quot; the prospects of an inter-industry agreement would benil. It would, however, be impossible to hold up discussions in Parisuntil decisions are reached on the agreements with the Commonwealth.Conclusion13. It will have to be decided before October whether we should aim at a compromise in the Free Trade Area discussions, and, if so, whether it should
be on the general lines of paragraph 7 (Formula &quot; A&quot;) or paragraph 10(Formula &quot; B &quot;). In a matter of such delicacy Ministers will wish to know theviews of Commonwealth Governments and the United Kingdom industry before taking a final decision. From the point of view of securing the co-operation ofthe United Kingdom industry Formula &quot; A &quot; is to be preferred, though there isof course no certainty that the industry can be persuaded to acquiesce even inthis fairly restrictive proposal. From the Commonwealth point of view andfrom the point of view of furthering the agreements on textile imports now under negotiation with the Commonwealth, Formula &quot;B&quot; is the better; theCommonwealth Relations Office and the Colonial Office point out that evenFormula &quot; B &quot; is likely to be unwelcome to the Commonwealth. It is not possibleto say which formula would be more easily negotiable in Paris. Formula &quot; B &quot;would be more attractive to the Swiss and the Scandinavians, whereas the Frenchand Italians will want the most restrictive solution they can get.14. The presentation in Montreal of this difficult and possibly explosivesubject will call for careful handling. It is recommended that we speak on thefollowing lines:  There is now no prospect of negotiating a 50 per cent, rule for textiles.Such are the differences of view in Paris that we shall be hard put to it tokeep textiles within the scope of the Free Trade Area at all. The only prospectfor agreement, as we see it, is on the basis of a process definition of origin with no alternative percentage rule. We cannot say what process definitionwill prove negotiable. Our own textile industry would like the cumulativeprocess rule (paragraph 3 above), but Her Majesty&apos;s Government does not propose to support that. The effectjye choice lies between something on thelines of Formula &quot; A &quot; and Formula &quot; B.&quot; Our judgment is that the formula which will emerge in Paris is unlikely to be more liberal than &quot; A.&quot;We see no alternative to speaking on these lines. If we were to indicate to theCommonwealth that Formula &quot; B &quot; was our objective or even that &quot; B &quot; mightbe acceptable in Paris, and we were then driven to Formula &quot; A &quot; by pressure from the United Kingdom industry or other Organisation for European economic co-operation countries, Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be in a mostembarrassing position.15. It is visualised that consultation with the United Kingdom industry would be initiated in the latter part of the week beginning 15th September, i.e., afterthe subject has been broached in Montreal but before the industry delegation leavesfor Hong Kong. It is recommended that (subject to any unexpected developments in Montreal) we tell the industry that any restrictive formula would be unwelcome to the Commonwealth. For that and other reasons, the Government could not support the cumulative process rule. Even Formula &quot; A &quot; would, in our judgment,be likely to cause much difficulty with the Commonwealth. On the other hand,Commonwealth Governments could probably be persuaded to acquiesce insomething on the lines of Formula &quot; B.&quot; We should warn the industry thatinsistence by Her Majesty&apos;s Government on &quot; A&quot; would be liable to have an adverse reaction on the prospects of negotiating an inter-industry agreement.If, however, the industry express strongly the view that they could not acquiesce in any proposal more liberal than Formula &quot; A,&quot; we should defer further discussionwith them for the time being.16. Ministers are asked to authorise approaches to the Commonwealth andthe United Kingdom industry on the lines of the two preceding paragraphs.Board of Trade, Whitehall, S.W. 1,5th September, 1958.
