Officials have prepared a general brief, which I am circulating withthis paper. They have also prepared papers on three matters namely, agriculture,textiles and financial assistance for the under-developed countries on whichpolicy decisions are now needed. I have circulated these papers separately,together with a further paper on agriculture.General Brief for Montreal Discussions2. I hope that my colleagues will agree with the general line in this brief.The main points are as follows:  (1) We must continue to take the Commonwealth completely into our confidence in all these matters, as we have in the past.(2) The &quot; origin &quot; problem will need careful explanation, but, apart from thevery difficult question of textiles, on which there is a separate paper(C. (58) 184), our interests are very much the same as those of theCommonwealth. The line it is proposed should be taken on this problem is within the general limits that were approved earlier thisyear by the Economic Policy Committee and the Prime MinistersCommittee and set out in C. (58) 110, which I circulated to mycolleagues but which, owing to the French political crisis and the suspension of the negotiations, we did not in fact discuss. This linewill also constitute the instructions of our representative on the steering Board for Trade during the discussions which start next week in Paris.3. The other two main points in the general brief, namely, agriculture andfinancial assistance for the under-developed countries, are discussed in separatepapers.R.

COMMONWEALTH TRADE AND ECONOMIC CONFERENCEMAIN BRIEF ON FREE TRADE AREA AND EUROPEAN ECONOMICCOMMUNITYI. Consultation with the commonwealth the United Kingdom Government have given the following commitments toother Commonwealth Governments about consulting them on the Free Trade Areanegotiations:  (i) The communique issued at the end of the Meeting of commonwealth finance Ministers at Mont Tremblant:  &quot; It was also agreed that there is need for effective machineryfor continuous consultation among Commonwealth countries on matters related to the European Economic Community and theproposed Free Trade Area.&quot;(ii) Paragraph 129 of the Report of the Second Preparatory Meeting of officials in June 1958:-&quot;They [the United Kingdom Delegation] renewed their undertaking that full consultation with the rest of the Common-wealth would continue and that thus, if any changes of policy wereto be examined, account would be taken of Commonwealth views.&quot;(iii) In the course of that meeting the United Kingdom representatives are recorded as having reaffirmed past assurances that the United kingdom would not undertake any commitments in major fields, such as originand agriculture, without full prior consultation with the Commonwealth.2. But we have not only a commitment to consult the Commonwealth; thereis a very positive interest for the United Kingdom to consult as fully as possible at montreal, in particular on origin, agriculture and finance for peripheral countries.It is true that the present state of the Paris discussions does not make this easy, sinceall of these negotiations will not effectively begin until the Montreal Conference isended. But, during the meeting of the Inter-Governmental Committee in October,some specific issues will arise on which the United Kingdom must be in a positionto commit itself without a pause in order to obtain and consider comments from all or some Commonwealth countries; if not, the prospect of reaching a satisfactory solution to the Free Trade Area negotiations will be seriously reduced and theUnited Kingdom may be held responsible for slowing down the pace of thenegotiations.3. In these circumstances, how can we fulfil at Montreal our commitments to consult the Commonwealth? The following sections on origin, agriculture and finance for the peripheral countries show that it is our intention to speak as fully andfrankly as possible to the Commonwealth; we intend to give them an account of our objectives and those of other countries and to explain what aspects we think aresusceptible of settlement. In fact, over a great part of this field, we shall disclosemuch of our negotiating position in advance: we must impress on theCommonwealth the need for discretion about these discussions. If this is done at montreal, and there is no serious adverse reaction from individual commonwealth countries, we should then be able to press ahead with the Free Trade Areanegotiations in September and October without necessarily having specifically to seek the views of Commonwealth Governments on particular points before or duringthe Inter-Governmental Committee meeting and await their replies.4. This would not exclude the probability that, if a wholly new method ofdealing with a particular problem were to appear and this had evidently important implications for one or more Commonwealth countries, we might want to discuss
the matter with those countries before reaching a final decision in Paris. This mayprobably be true in the case of agriculture, where we must clearly consult theCommonwealth if we intend to depart in any way from our assurances regarding thepreservation in full of Commonwealth interests in the United Kingdom market for food, drink and tobacco.5. The handling of the origin question is particularly important. TheCommonwealth have agreed &quot; that the achievement of an outward-looking free trade Area on the lines proposed by the United Kingdom is of high importance,both politically and economically.&quot; In so agreeing, Commonwealth countries haveagreed in principle that their preferential position vis-a-vis the members of the free trade Area in respect of goods covered by the Free Trade Area will graduallydisappear. In a few cases these preferences are bound contractually, and in due course we shall have to negotiate out of such commitments with the commonwealth countries concerned, but that negotiation cannot come during the course of the free trade Area negotiations themselves or we shall never finish.6. Apart from this consideration, Commonwealth countries themselves have akeen and legitimate interest in the rules of origin adopted for the Free Trade Area.Restrictive origin rules, which would be welcome to certain European countries,would be potentially damaging to the Commonwealth because they would handicapusers of Commonwealth and other non-Area materials inside the Free Trade Area.On the other hand, rules which were highly advantageous to the commonwealth would not be generally acceptable in Europe. But the interests of the Common-wealth and ourselves are very much the same in this and we shall do all we can tosecure liberal origin rules. We must, however, beware of committing ourselves to detailed consultation with the Commonwealth, or individual members of it, on allthese points as they arise or we shall end by losing whatever little freedom ofmanoeuvre we have left. It is most important, therefore, to avoid entering into any new commitments either collectively to all Commonwealth Governments in theConference or informally with individual Governments.7. There is a further point what is meant by consultations? It is important that this word does not come to mean Commonwealth agreement. By anundertaking to consult we mean an undertaking to consider Commonwealth views before reaching our final decision. As regards Colonial interests, Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment have of course a special responsibility and in deciding what is &quot; inthe United Kingdom interest&quot; at any stage we must necessarily take into accountas part of the calculation possible repercussions on the Colonies.8. The course we are taking is not without risks. On the one hand, wecannot afford to find ourselves in October in the position of having to getCommonwealth acquiescence in the details of what we may wish to agree to asa matter of urgency in the Free Trade Area negotiations. Were that to happenthe chances of getting a Free Trade Area at all, and if at all on reasonable terms,would be significantly reduced. On the other hand, if later on commonwealth countries can claim that they were not adequately consulted and warned of theconsequences of action contemplated by the United Kingdom, we shall not only have political trouble, but we shall be prejudicing the whole future of our tradingrelations with the Commonwealth. In this situation, the only course open to usis to take the Commonwealth into our full confidence at Montreal and to try tocarry them with us as far as we can.9. We should explain to them that at the meetings in Paris in Octobermatters may move very fast and that it is unlikely that we shall be able to seektheir views on particular points and await their replies before committing ourselves,perhaps on issues which cannot at this stage be foreseen. Otherwise we maylose an opportunity to clinch the negotiation. We shall, of course, continue tokeep them closely informed of developments and to take into account in reachingour decisions any comments which they are able to send to us quickly. Theymight therefore care to satisfy themselves that they will be in a position duringthe discussions in Paris to send us, if necessary with extreme urgency, any commentsthey wish to make on the information we shall be sending them.II. Origin10. It is proposed that we should explain in detail and with frankness theline which we propose to take in the discussions during the next two months inParis on these questions, in order both to discharge the obligation which we havetaken to consult the Commonwealth and also to ensure that, if we are able to
settle in Paris substantially on the lines suggested, we shall be able to avoid the delays of further Commonwealth consultation. The following are the main points:  (a) Our objective will still be to secure the adoption of what has come tobe called &quot; conventional origin rules &quot; a combination of &quot; percentageof added value &quot; and &quot; processes &quot; together with an agreed basic materials list. This does not mean that we rule out the possibilityof certain special and exceptional arrangements, on the lines indicatedin (e) to (/;) below, within some sectors to guard against deflectionsof trade in advance.(b) In general, we shall seek to deal with deflections of trade as and whenthey arise by suitable procedures. If this proves acceptable, the main problem here will be whether members of the Free Trade Area shouldbe entitled to take measures of defence against deflections of tradeunilaterally, subject to subsequent justification in the Organisation,or whether they should be entitled to act only after they have been authorised to do so by the Institutions. We should prefer the latter, butthis may not be negotiable. The solution of this problem will alsodepend on how the main discussion on Institutions proceeds.(c) In agreeing to an examination of the origin problem sector by sector wehave not changed our basic approach, as described above, but it hasbeen necessary to agree to this in order to facilitate the Frenchwithdrawal from their extreme position.(d) There is good reason for hoping that we shall not find ourselves facedwith a claim that there should be, as a matter of principle across the beard, compensation charges in default of tariff harmonisation.(e) Basic materials. Our objective will be to seek agreement among theSeventeen that origin rules in respect both of basic materials and semi-manufactures made from them should be based on the assumptionthat there will be low or zero external tariffs on basic materials. Itwill not be our aim to prevent countries from retaining higher tariffsif they wish but only to preclude them from invoking the proceduresdesigned to prevent the undermining of those high tariffs by deflectionsof trade. If we cannot get agreement to this across the board, wemust seek to limit the area in which it is not accepted as narrowly aspossible. Provided the number of cases where exceptional treatment is provided for can be kept small, it may be possible to work outarrangements providing for more restrictive origin rules or even for adminsitrative procedures such as compensation charges under suitablesafeguards to deal with problems of deflections of trade in respect ofthis limited list.(/) Engineering goods. We hope to secure agreement to define origin forthe whole of this sector on the basis of &quot; percentage of added value &quot;combined with the basic materials list. We are also willing to agree on an alternative list of processes. A proposal may be made for somerules of tariff alignment, whereby the members of the Free Trade area would undertake to charge the same external tariff on components ason complete machines with a view to discouraging assembly. while there are objections in principle to such alignment over the wholefield, this is in the main in accordance with our existing practice andit may in the end be worth while accepting it.(g) Chemicals. Here we hope in the end, and after very great difficulty, thatthe conventional origin rules will be accepted. In view of the Frenchdifficulties, it may be necessary to envisage especially flexible procedures for dealing with deflections of trade in this sector.(h) Textiles.[To be completed in the light of Ministerial decisions.]III. Agriculture[To be completed in the light of Ministerial decisions.]IV. Financial Assistance for the Peripherals[To be completed in the light of Ministerial decisions.]
