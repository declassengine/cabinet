secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1958C. (58) 171 Copy No.31st July, 1958.CABINETNIGERIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Nigeria Constitutional Conference, which adjourned in June 1957 to await the reports of certain Commissions to whose establishment it had agreed,will resume in London on 29th September. Its composition will be much as before:there will be 70 to 80 Nigerian delegates and advisers broadly representative ofNigerian opinion as a whole.  The Conference is likely to last most of October.The 1957 conference. At the 1957 Conference I agreed to the creation of an office of federal prime Minister and to an all-Nigerian Federal Council of Ministers presided overby the Governor-General, whose members would be appointed by the Governor-General on the Prime Minister^ recommendation. The United Kingdom interest was secured by the agreement of the Conference that the Governor-General should retain until independence his general reserved powers to act without consulting his ministers or against their advice, and his responsibility, in his discretion, for external affairs and defence, for the use of and operational control of the Police and for theFederal Public Service.3. It was also agreed, in fulfilment of the undertaking given by my predecessor in 1953, that the Eastern and Western Regions should be grantedRegional self-government. This mainly involved the withdrawal of the generalreserved and discretionary powers of the Governors of these Regions. largely because of the obvious possibilities of abuse of power by inexperiencedGovernments I obtained agreement to the distribution of some of the powerspreviously held by the Governor among independent bodies such as the public and Judicial Service Commissions, and to the inclusion in the Regionalconstitutions of safeguards for the integrity of certain other organs of government.It was also agreed that the Governor-General should be empowered to interveneif a self-governing Region threatened the functioning of the Federal government or the continuance of federation. In addition constitutional changes were agreed for the Southern Cameroons and the Northern Region. The Northernrepresentatives said they did not want Regional self-government until 1959.The Present Position4. Most of the changes agreed were brought into effect last August. the leader in the Federal Legislature of the Northern People&apos;s Congress, AlhajiAbubakar Tafawa Balewa, became the first Federal Prime Minister and sought tocreate a &quot; national&quot; Government to work for early independence by including inhis team Ministers from the Action Group, who are the dominant Party in theWest but weak in the Federal Legislature, in addition to members of the national council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (N.C.N.C.), the major Party in the East,and of his own Party, the Northern People&apos;s Congress (N.P.C.). The Prime minister is sagacious and able and relations between him and the Governor-General arefrank and cordial. He is openly anti-Communist, he is under no illusions about thedifficulties of the task facing both himself and the country, and his policy is likelyto be as pro-Western as the narrow Muslim outlook of his principal Northern53809
supporters will allow. (In his Party hierarchy he is only deputy to the leader, thevain and pompous Sardauna of Sokoto, Premier of the Northern Region.) HisGovernment, however, has been only a moderate success. Because the fortunesof the Federal Ministers are closely bound up with those of the main RegionalParties from which they come they have not always found it possible to develop a true Federal outlook, and where these Regional interests have clashed theMinisters have sometimes been content to record disagreement.5. In the West the grant of Regional self-government has on balance been justified. The Action Group Government, led by the Premier, Chief Awolowo,have proved reasonable and competent administrators and, although with the steady run-down of the cadre of overseas officers there is bound to be some declinein standards of administration, the advanced educational programme of the Regionshould in time provide sufficient replacements. The Premier aspires to nationalleadership and has to this end formed a close alliance with the principal Oppositionelements in the North and East.6. In the East government has seriously run down. Dr. Azikiwe (&quot; Zik &quot;),leader of the N.C.N.C. remains in power as the personification of Ibo tribalism,but his chronic unwillingness to tolerate around him men of independence of mindhas brought into being a Regional Executive Council, almost all of whom arenonentities. Some of the Federal Ministers drawn from his Party, notablyDr. Mbadiwe, have recently lost their posts through constant but so far ineffectivewarfare against his personal dictatorship of party affairs. His star may be on thewane. At present he has no serious rival as leader of the Ibos, who are much thelargest race in the Region, and although it would be much healthier for Nigeriaif his hand were removed from the helm, the time has passed when Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment could take any effective action to hasten this process. He must beleft to the disillusionment of his own people.7. The vast Northern Region is still well behind the others in &quot; progress.&quot;Two-thirds of its 18 million people are strict Muslims, accepting the authority oftheir Emirs. Educational progress is still slow and there is no prospect for ageneration of the Region being able to replace from its own resources the overseasofficers who have served them so well. The North fears and dislikes the moreeducated Southerners and if they were not economically bound to the Federationwould be glad to be quit of it. The Emirs have for the most part recognised thatthey must come to terms with democracy and support the party at present in power,the N.P.C. The Premier, the Sardauna of Sokoto, is himself of a princely family.The Public services. Since the East and West became self-governing the overseas officers therehave been entitled to retire with lump-sum compensation. This will be the positionin the North when it attains Regional self-government next year and in the federal public Service on the attainment of independence. The premature retirement of experienced overseas officers is the gravest single threat Nigeria faces to thecontinuance of good government. A Colonial Office representative visited Nigeriaearlier this year to enquire into means of meeting this threat. A White Paper isbeing published this week setting out the proposals put to the Nigerian governments as a result of his mission and of their response. The Federal and NorthernGovernments have broadly endorsed the proposals and this should go some wayto encouraging officers in their services to remain. The East and West contemplateapplying the proposals to selected officers only and from these Regions the exoduswill no doubt continue. At best and whatever efforts are made, overseas officersin Nigeria are now a wasting asset.Prospects for the Conference(a) The Problem of Minorities9. At last year&apos;s Conference the minority Parties forcibly represented theirfears of exploitation after self-government by the majority Parties, with their mainlytribal and religious bases, and pressed for the setting up of separate States of theirown. After bitter discussion I was invited to appoint a Commission to enquire into the question. The Commission, under the Chairmanship of Sir Henry Willink,is about to submit its Report, which will be the main item of the resumedConference agenda. It will recommend no new States; some of its proposals arelikely to provoke fierce controversy.  The Action Group, which seeks national
power as the champion of minorities everywhere, will probably expressdissatisfaction and continue to fight for new States as a main plank in its platformfor next year&apos;s Federal elections.(b) The Police10. Either &quot;in connection with the question of minorities or as a separate itemthere will probably be renewed pressure, which I shall resist, for the bulk of theFederal Police to be divided up into separate Regional forces.(c) Fiscal Questions11. Dissatisfaction over the existing division of revenue between theFederation and the Regions and over the powers to raise revenue led last year tothe appointment of a Fiscal Commission. The report of this Commission, of which sir Jeremy Raisman was Chairman, is about to be published and will be consideredby the Conference.   It is unlikely to prove a major bone of contention.(d) Self-government for the Northern Region12. The Northern Regional Government have informed me that they wishto be granted Regional self-government from the 15th March, 1959. In accordancewith my predecessors undertaking, I am bound to accede to this request. the pattern of self-government in the East and West will largely be followed but becauseof the backwardness of the Northern Region I shall try I cannot put it higher to retain some greater powers for the Governor than those retained by the governors of the East and West, and to obtain assurances about the incidence ofMuslim law and the retention of much of the present structure of the ProvincialAdministration.(e) The Question of Independence13. At last year&apos;s Conference I was pressed by all Parties to agree to independence first in 1959 and then, when this was seen to be impracticable, on the specific date of 2nd April, 1960. After a series of discussions I gave an undertaking in the following form:  &quot; I understand that it is proposed that some time about January 1960 thenew Nigerian Parliament will debate a resolution asking Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment to agree to full self-government within the Commonwealth by a date in 1960 which will have been mentioned in the resolution .... on receipt of your resolution Her Majesty&apos;s Government will consider it withsympathy and will then be prepared to fix a date when they would accede tothe request. We could not at this stage give any undertaking that the date would be the same date as asked for in the resolution, though we would do our utmost to meet the resolution in a reasonable and practicable manner.... Her Majesty&apos;s Government would of course be very much guided intheir choice of a date by the way everything was going, by how the two Regionsnow about to enjoy Regional self-government had taken the strain of this greatstep forward, and by how the country as a whole had faced up to the problemsof minorities, on which a Commission would already have reported.&quot;The Nigerian delegations expressed their disappointment but did not rejectthis undertaking and informed me that they would revert to the demand for independence on 2nd April, 1960. The Prime Ministers &quot; national &quot; Governmentwas formed to work for independence on this date and at the coming conference i shall be under renewed pressure to accede to the date with or without conditions,or at least to go some way beyond the undertaking given last year.14. I propose to reaffirm last year&apos;s undertaking but not to go beyond it.The weaknesses in the North and East that I have described are likely overthe next year or two to become more pronounced as overseas officers begin toleave the North after Regional Government next March and as the exodus fromthe East continues. The &quot; national&quot; Government at the Centre has developedno national outlook or community of interest. I understand that at the Federalelections late next year the Northern People&apos;s Congress and the N.C.N.C. (whoare normally kept apart by mutual suspicion and by Northern dislike of dr. Azikiwe), alarmed by the determination and organising ability of the ActionGroup, are likely to combine to keep the Action Group out of power. Such a combination would offer no great reassurance for competent or courageous Federal
Government. The tribal divisions that remain in Nigeria are so deep that the unity and stability of the country cannot yet be taken for granted. All these arereasons for going slowly. But in view of the decline in the number of overseasofficers in post and of the mounting pressure for early independence, the freedomof action left to Her Majesty&apos;s Government is small if Nigerian goodwill is to bemaintained. I cannot go back on the undertaking I gave last year but it is in my view essential that, before making the final decision to give independence, her majesty&apos;s Government should be able to assure itself that the new federal government elected late in 1959 can properly claim to represent majority opinion in the country and has a reasonable prospect of maintaining the unity and stability of the country.15. If this undertaking is strictly adhered to it is unlikely, even if all goes well,that independence could come as early as April 1960. Provided that a competentFederal Government is formed late in 1959 there will need to be final discussions between this Government and Her Majesty&apos;s Government early in 1960 and then the drafting and passage of legislation here, so that the second half of 1960 seemsthe earliest practicable time for independence to come. I expect to have informaltalks with the Federal Prime Minister before the coming Conference and I shalldiscuss this question with him.The Trust Territory of the British Cameroons16. The Northern British Cameroons is administered as part of the northern region and has always declared itself content so to remain. The southern Cameroons has its own Government which to date has been financially dependenton the Federal Government and has ultimately been responsible to the Governor-General. The recommendations of the Fiscal Commission are likely to give theSouthern Cameroons a fair measure of financial independence and theirrepresentatives are committed to asking at the coming Conference for full Regionalself-government. With Nigerian independence approaching, this small government must quickly learn to stand on its own feet and I propose to agree to a substantial increase in its responsibilities but probably not at present to full internal self-government on the model of the major Regions.17. Before Nigeria becomes independent the people of the British Cameroonswill have to make known their wishes for their future. The United NationsMission, which is making a regular visit to the British and French Cameroonslater this year, is being asked to consider the procedure for consulting the peopleof the British Cameroons. I hope that as a result of their recommendations therewill be separate popular consultations (probably by plebiscite) in the North andSouth early in 1960, and that we shall be able to ensure that the choice put to thepeople is one between joining an independent Nigeria and continuing under trusteeship pending a final decision about their future. There is little doubt thatthe Northern British Cameroons will choose to stay as part of the Northern Region.The choice of the Southern Cameroons is less certain. The Parties supporting the present Government are in favour of becoming a separate Region in anindependent Nigeria: the main Opposition party is in favour of continuation of trusteeship with an eye to joining up with the French Cameroons in time.18. I invite my colleagues to note the present position and seek their concurrence in the course outlined above. The Conference may well be a difficult and possibly a stormy one.A.
