ALAN NUNN MAYTMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsDr. Alan Nunn May has again applied for a passport.   He says that he wants to go to Austria on holiday and he expresses the view that whatever reasons may have prompted previous refusals are no longervalid.   As the Cabinet decided in January, 1956, (CM.(56) 4th ConclusionSiMinute 5) that any application that might be made by Dr. Nunn May forthe grant of a passport for the purpose of travelling to Eastern germany should be rejected, I feel that it is a matter on which I should consultmy colleagues.background. On Dr. Nunn May&apos;s release from prison in December, 1952,the Cabinet decided that if he applied for a passport, his application shouldbe refused (C.C.(5Z) 108th Conclusions, Minute 6).   This decision took account of precedents which suggested that, in the very rare cases wherethe activities of an individual are notoriously undesirable or dangerous,Parliament may be expected to uphold a decision to refuse him a passport.Subsequent applications by Dr. Nunn May for a passport have also been refused, principally on the ground that if one were issued to him he mightdefect and that his defection would seriously lessen the chances of persuading the Americans to adopt a more liberal policy over the exchangeof information about atomic matters,3. I brought the matter before the Cabinet in 1956 because I hadlearnt that the East German Government might offer an appointment to dr.  Nunn May.   In the memorandum which I then submitted (C.P.(56) 14)I pointed out that we did not believe that Dr. Nunn May&apos;s defection wouldin itself be harmful to our security or beneficial, from the point of viewof nuclear research, to a potential enemy.   I also drew attention to thefact that if he were determined to leave the country he could do so withouta passport.   Discussion of the matter in Cabinet showed that there was general agreement that, even though Dr. Nunn May could not be prevented from travelling to Eastern Germany, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should at least refrain from giving him any facilities for such a journey.   in reaching this conclusion the Cabinet had particularly in mind the viewof H.M. Ambassador at Washington that the prospects for Anglo-american co-operation on atomic energy projects would be gravely prejudiced ifDr. Nunn May took up employment in Eastern Germany.-1-
Present considerations .On the other hand, there is evidence to suggest that he is putting downroots in this country.   Recently he bought one annuity outright and ispaying annual instalments on another:   both will be paid to him when heis 65.    He is also contemplating taking out an education protection policy for the benefit of his son.   There is also some evidence that he isinterested in buying a house.   Dr. Nunn May&apos;s financial position appearsto be sound and when the intermediary who in 1956 offered him employ-ment in East Germany visited this country recently, she made no attempt,as far as is known, to contact him.5. The chances of Dr. Nunn May defecting thus seem small andwhen the formalities connected with our new agreement with the UnitedStates Government on the exchange of atomic information have beencompleted and Congress has gone into recess, which should be early inAugust, the possibility of trouble from the United States will be much diminished.    Very shortly, therefore, the considerations which in 1956caused the Cabinet to decide that Dr. Nunn May should be denied a pass-port will only apply with very much reduced effect.   There are still noscientific or security objections to his travelling abroad.6. I therefore recommend that at a decent interval after theformalities connected with the new agreement have been completed andwhen Congress has gone into recess, a passport should be issued to dr. Nunn May to enable him to travel to Austria.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.I.Zsth iuiy. iw     1 THIS IS A COPY. THE ORIGINAL ISI RETAINED UNDER SECTION 3 (4)OF THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT-2-
