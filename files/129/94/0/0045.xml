SECRET^THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF iffiR&quot; BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNME!Printed for the Cabinet. September 1958C. (58) 19526th September, 1958CABINETHOUSING policy memorandum by the Lord chancellor the proposals of the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of housing and Local Government for a new policy on home ownership, which ate:set out in detail in Annex A to this memorandum, have been discussed by &amp;Committee of Ministers under my chairmanship.2. The principle of the scheme is to make more money available to thebuilding societies in order to enable the societies to grant more, and morefavourable, mortgages to prospective owner-occupiers. The Government would1lend money to societies participating in the scheme, up to an aggregate total of,&apos;say,  100 millions, and the societies would undertake to grant 95 per cent,mortgages (a) to any credit-worthy borrower wishing to buy a house valued at not more-,than  2,500 and built before 1919. The total amount of these loans:would, in the case of each society, form the limit of the government&apos;s&apos;loan to the society;(b) to the extent that their own funds were adequate to meet the demand, forthe purchase of houses valued at not more than  2,500 and built between i1919 and 1940. - mIn either case the mortgage would be repayable over not less than 20 years and the:rate of interest would not exceed that payable on the societies&apos; ordinary mortgages, i3. It is here that we run into difficulty. Building societies currently lend money on mortgages at 6 per cent, and borrow at about 5 per cent., the differencerepresenting provision to meet expenses, losses, &amp;c, and the accumulation 0f;necessary reserves. But if the Government were to lend money to the building societies at a rate in the region of 5 per cent., they would be lending at a rate notonly lower than that at which they themselves have to borrow (5^-5f per cent.), butlower also than that at which they lend to the nationalised industries and New TownsCorporations (5J per cent.) and to the local authorities (6 per cent.),4.   We should then be vulnerable to criticism (i) for, in effect, subsidising the building societies and those who buy housesthrough them;(ii) for binding ourselves to lend money to the societies at rates fixed, not byus, but by themselves; and(iii) for  giving  home-ownership  unjustifiably  high  priority  as  againstdevelopment of the nationalised industries and the New Towns and thewhole range of social investment by local authorities, including, inparticular, slum clearance.In addition, we should subject ourselves to strong pressure from the local authoritiesto reduce the rate at which they can borrow from the Public Works Loans Board,and so imperil the whole of our interest rate policy.
5. These objections are formidable. Nevertheless, the Ministers who have examined the scheme are satisfied that it is a good one; that, in the light of possible alternatives, it represents the most efficient means of giving effect to our policy; andthat we should therefore go forward with it, provided that the inherent difficulty ofthe interest-rates can be minimised, if not wholly resolved.6. How will this best be done? The building societies will probably welcome the scheme and wish to participate in it. Provided, therefore, that we do not commit ourselves publicly to using them for our scheme and leave them in some doubt whether we might not, after all. prefer to work through the agency of thelocal authorities, we may be able to persuade them in negotiation to pay interest at 5  per cent, or, less probably, even 51 per cent, on money borrowed from theGovernment. The subsidy element in the scheme would then be only a smallone and would be the more defensible when it is remembered that a statutorysubsidy equivalent to at least 1 per cent, is given to both housing in the New Townsand slum clearance. Moreover, while it would remain true that the rate of interestpaid to the Exchequer by the building societies would vary in accordance with changes in the rate which they charge their own borrowers, those changes are themselves determined largely by the modifications which the Government makefrom time to time in their own interest rate policy.7. But to the criticism that we were giving too high a priority to housepurchasers compared with other forms of social investment there would still beno..complete answer. We could only say that this was our policy; and it wouldbe essential that we should make no concession to the inevitable pressure to givesimilarly favourable treatment to the local authorities and the nationalised industries.Improvement and Conversion Grants. Side by side with the house-piircnase. scheme is a revised system of improvement and conversion grants worked out by the ;Minister of Housing. Details are at Annex B. Broadly, the proposals is: that in,future local authorities should have no discretion to refuse applicationsfor graht,: provided that the applicant can satisfy the appropriate conditions. A&quot; standard improvement&quot; would be instituted, which would automatically attractgrant (up to a maximum of, say,  150) on half the cost of the work. The owner&apos;ssharei would, where he took advantage of the new house-purchase scheme, be advanced&apos;by&apos; the building society. Non-standard improvements and conversionswould continue to be subject to approval by the local authority and, when approved,would attract grant, as of right, up to a maximum of  400 on a pound-for-poundbasis. And in order to encourage the improvement of rented accommodation,local authorities in England and Wales (or possibly the County Courts: this point is still under consideration) would be empowered to fix rents for improved houses and conversions, subject to a minimum equal to the permitted rent under the rent Act. ;9. The Committee were satisfied that this revivification of the present systemof improvement grants would be of real value, both on merits and politically. Thenecessary legislation could be combined with that for the house-purchase scheme..  . 10.   Conclusion. We therefore recommend the Cabinet . (a) to approve the proposals for a scheme to assist house purchase throughthe building societies, on the lines set out in Annex A, provided thatthe societies agree to pay interest on money borrowed from theGovernment at a rate not more than \ per cent, lower than the ratecharged to their own borrowers;..... (b) to authorise the Minister of Housing to make a statement of theGovernment&apos;s intentions in general terms, without committing us to.,, the building societies; .: ii)v \c) to approve the proposals for a revised system of improvement andconversion grants, as at Annex B.       - ii.0c?i !^;:::I;-S: &apos;. :&quot;; :V;;&apos;:. k.House of Lords, S.W. 1,r: :      20th September, 1958.     .&apos; &apos; &apos; &apos;,&quot;,
ANNEX AHOME OWNERSHIPMemorandum by Secretary of State for Scotland and Minister of housing and Local Government and Minister for Welsh affairs there is a big unsatisfied demand for home ownership in many parts of thecountry. As a party we believe firmly in a property-owning democracy.Undoubtedly, progress towards this can be most readily encouraged by a spread ofhome ownership. Some of our back-benchers have lately made proposals tofacilitate the purchase of houses for owner-occupation, and the indications that havebeen given in the Press that the Government has a plan to assist home ownershiphave shown that there would be wide popular support for the right kind of scheme.2. We have been going carefully into the possibilities of further help for people who want to buy a home of their own, and are now in a position to lay our proposals before our colleagues.3. The main obstacle to-day to an extension of home ownership is not the rateof interest, nor the need to put down a deposit, but the difficulty of getting a loanon mortgage because the demand on the building societies exceeds their available resources. The simple and effective remedy is for the Government to make money available for mortgage loans. If the Government do so, they must of course see thatthe loans to borrowers are made on reasonable terms.4. To make additional money available for the finance of house purchasewould not require any new lending machinery. In the building societies theorganisation already exists. By far the greater part of the money lent for house purchase is advanced through these societies, which exist solely for this kindof business. Because of their long experience, and also because their organisationnow covers every town and village in the country, the building societies are in ourview the most effective and satisfactory channel for making Government money available to increase the flow of mortgages for house purchase.5. As a result of informal discussions with the heads of the Building Societies&quot;Association, we are satisfied that a workable scheme could be devised which wouldbe quickly effective and likely to give a substantial impetus to a spread of homeownership. The Treasury see serious difficulty about one (cardinal) feature of thescheme. This is explained in paragraph 11 below. This apart, they concur in theessential features of the scheme, which would be as follows:  (i) Government loans would be made to approved building societies subject to conditions approved by the Treasury.(ii) Approved building societies would be those whose deposits can qualify forTrustee status under rules to be prescribed by the Chief registrar of Friendly Societies.(iii) The maximum amount of money to be advanced to any approved building society would, at any rate at the outset, be limited to the total amount ofthe loans made after a certain date by the society to owner-occupiers forthe purchase of private houses valued at  2,500 or less and built before 1st January, 1919 (see below about newer houses). The total advancesfor this purpose would not, however, exceed an agreed percentage of the deposit and share capital of the society (excluding for this purpose thespecial Government deposit).(iv) The total maximum amount of money to be advanced to all approvedbuilding societies would be fixed by the empowering legislation. To start with, a figure of  100 million is in mind.(v) Building societies would pay interest on the money lent by the government at a rate something in excess of the rate they pay (including tax) on their share capital. The initial rate would be negotiated with the building societies, and this would.then automatically vary with changes in the share capital rate.
(vi) Building societies coming into the scheme would undertake to grant 95 percent, mortgages to any credit-worthy borrower wanting to buy a housebuilt before 1919. The basic advance on the mortgage would be at least[80 per cent.], the balance being secured by an insurance policy. The. whole of the small lump-sum premium for this policy would be lent tothe borrower in addition to the 95 per cent, advance.(vii) The mortgage would be repayable over a period of not less than 20 yearsunless the mortgagor wanted a shorter period. The rate of interestpayable by the mortgagor would not exceed the rate recommended bythe Building Societies&apos; Association for the time being for individualmortgages for private houses for owner-occupation.(viii) Building societies would also undertake to advance 95 per cent, mortgageson identical terms for houses built between 1919 and 1940 and valued at 2,500 or less, in so far as their funds are adequate to meet the demandfor such mortgages (see paragraph 7 below),(ix) The scheme would be given effect through agreements to be made by the responsible Housing Minister with each approved building societywilling to participate.6. The categories and value of the houses to be covered by the scheme as denned at (iii) and (viii) in the preceding paragraph, are not intended to be fixedonce and for all. They would be incorporated in the scheme on introduction andwould be given a fair run. But with experience some modifications may be found desirable. The empowering legislation would provide for either of these matters tobe varied by Order.7. The proposal in paragraph 5 (iii) above would not mean that the benefit ofGovernment participation in the scheme would be restricted to houses built before 1st January, 1919. It is merely a convenient way of defining the scope of theGovernments liability. At present building societies are lending some  40-50millions a year on the purchase of pre-1919 houses, and so one effect of the new scheme would be to free this additional amount of money for lending on newernouses. It is believed also that Trustee status for deposits would lead to anadditional inflow of funds. Societies participating in the scheme should thereforebe able to give many borrowers, whose needs are not now being met, a 95 per cent,mortgage on small inter-war houses.8. More money should also be available for advances on the normal basis,i.e., up to 90 per cent., on post-1945 and currently-built houses though borrowershave far less difficulty in getting mortgages on these houses than on the older ones.It is indeed likely that the scheme will lead to a gradual increase in new private house-building, and this is a point that will have to be watched carefully from the investment standpoint.9. It is thought that there will be about 150 approved building societies eligible to participate in the scheme. Between them, they would probably represent morethan nine-tenths of the business done by all building societies. Would-be borrowerswill therefore have a wide choice of society from which to borrow, and this should lead to effective competition between the societies to attract new customers underthe scheme.10. As examples of the possibilities of the scheme, a man buying a housevalued at  1,000 (many older houses in the Provinces can be bought at this price)would have to find only about  84 for deposit, legal costs, &amp;c, and then would payable fraction over  7 a month on his mortgage. He could get a mortgage on these terms if his income was about  7 10s. a week. For a house costing  2,000, theman would need for deposit and expenses about  160, and then would have to payabout  14 a month, requiring an income of about  15 a week. At current wagelevels the possibility of home ownership would thus be opened to a very largenumber of working-class families.11. The point of difficulty referred to in paragraph 5 above arises inconnection with the terms on which funds are made available from the exchequer to the building societies. To enable building societies to grant mortgages under thescheme at the rate they charge on their normal business, the rate of interest charged to them by the Treasury though something above the rate (including tax) paid bythe societies on their share capital will be somewhat less than the current cost tothe Treasury. This flows from the fact that building societies finance their normalbusiness from short-term borrowing, whereas the Government funds would have
to be raised by long-term borrowing. Thus, at the present time with the building societies&apos; normal lending rate to mortgagors standing at 6 per cent., the building societies (after taking into account their administrative costs, income tax and profits tax, and allocation to reserves for depreciation) could not afford to pay more thansay &quot;5^ per cent, to the Treasury. The current cost to the Exchequer of long-termborrowing by the issue of marketable securities, however, is slightly over 5  per cent,and the current rate for Exchequer advances to the nationalised industries and theNew Town Corporations is 5  per cent. In other words, the scheme would involve an element of subsidy from the Exchequer to the building societies and theirborrowers.12. There is no practical escape from this difficulty if the scheme is to be worked through building societies (which appears to us far better than to set up aspecial Government agency, which is what the back-benchers&apos; memorandumproposed). Nor would it be possible to disguise the fact that in making thisarrangement the Government are making a breach in their general financial policy.If this is done, the justification must be that the Government attach such high socialimportance to the encouragement of home ownership throughout the country,particularly on the part of the small man, that they think it right to make a specialexception for this one limited purpose. They are doing this in a way that will fit in with the normal working of building societies, without however makingGovernment money available to the societies at any less cost than the societies areordinarily accustomed to pay for their own borrowings. The rate of interest to bepaid by the societies will, in fact, be slightly more than the rate they normally pay.But it would have to be made clear that there could be no question of making any similar Exchequer concession to other borrowers for any purpose, such as the nationalised industries, local authorities and the New Town Corporations.13. It may be suggested that the scheme might be operated through the agency of local authorities rather than of the building societies. This point is likely to betaken by the Opposition, who will no doubt argue that local authorities could do the job not only as effectively but more cheaply. Most of the local authorities have atsome time or other lent for house purchase, and their general practice is to charge the borrower about -]- per cent, more than they themselves have to pay for themoney. Therefore, if local authorities were allowed to borrow on the same terms asthe building societies, they would be able to lend at about \ per cent, less than thebuilding societies. Alternatively, if they were allowed like the nationalised industries to borrow at 5f per cent, (the present Public Works Loans Board(P.W.L.B.) long-term rate is 6 per cent.) they would be able to advance house loansat 6 per cent., i.e., on the same terms as the building societies.14. But either arrangement would be open to very serious objections. Itwould not only mean enabling local authorities to borrow at a specially low rateof interest: it would also involve assuring them of free access to the P.W.L.B.for this purpose. This would, in two respects, be contrary to the government&apos;s policy, which is to allow local authorities to borrow from the Exchequer through,the P.W.L.B. only when they cannot raise the money they require in the market,and to charge them a rate of interest reflecting the credit of a local authority ofgood standing in the market. (This rate is inevitably somewhat higher than thatpaid by the Government itself.) Such a breach of the policy would risk bringing the local authorities back to the Exchequer for the whole&apos;of their borrowings;they would immediately argue that a number of their other services, and indeedother parts of their housing service (such as slum clearance), are more important than the encouragement of home ownership, and accordingly that borrowing for those services should be given similar treatment. To give the local authoritiesfree access to money at 5i per cent, would also, of course, lead to difficulties withother borrowers in the public sector, such as the nationalised industries.15. To operate the scheme through the local authorities would also involveenabling them to borrow freely at a reduced rate for all their lending for house purchase, since it would be quite impossible to charge them one rate of interest for loans for pre-1919 houses and another (higher) rate of interest for loans for post-1919 houses. But such a proposal would provoke a storm with the building societies, who would bitterly resent Government action to enable local authoritiesto lend over the whole field of house purchase on what would be, for the localauthorities, specially favourable terms. Under the first alternative in paragraph 13,indeed, the whole pattern of borrowing would be disrupted; the local authorities would be able to undercut the building societies.
16. For all these reasons it would be in our view undesirable to bring localauthorities into the scheme, either in place of the building societies or alongsidethem. Fundamentally, participation in the scheme by local authorities is unnecessary. The building society organisation covers the whole country and isable to offer an efficient service to borrowers wherever they may be, while its resources for lending will now be substantially enlarged. The making of advancesfor house purchase is an ancillary function of local authorities and the amount ofbusiness done by them is small in comparison: in recent years the total amountadvanced by them has been between  50 and  70 millions a year as compared with 350 to  400 millions by building societies. To bring in the local authorities-there are about 1,750 of them in Great Britain would complicate the workingof the scheme without giving (apart from this point about interest rates) anycommensurate practical advantage. If the scheme were to be operated through them instead of through the building societies, it would also be necessary to legislate to put compulsion on those local authorities who do not at present operatetheir powers for making advances.17. Confidential discussions on the scheme have recently taken place withthe local authority associations in England and Wales. (A meeting with theScottish local authority associations is to take place later this month.) At those discussions the local authorities did not make a point of pressing that they shouldbe allowed to participate in the scheme. As has been said above, giving assistance towards house purchase is a minor interest for the local authorities, in comparisonwith their major interests in building houses, schools, &amp;c. They concentrated uponthe terms on which Government money would be made available to building societies and upon the fact that this would be lower than the RW.L.B. rate. Thelocal authorities have frequently represented that the P.W.L.B. rate is artificiallyhigh, and the line they are likely to take if the scheme goes forward is not to criticise the provision of a special rate of interest for building societies, but to seizeupon this arrangement as a fresh argument in support of their claim for a lowering of the P.W.L.B. rates for all their borrowing. Such a claim would of course haveto be firmly resisted for the reasons explained in paragraph 14.18. Though the  50-70 millions a year lent by local authorities for house purchase is a small part of the total advances made for this purpose, their contribution is not negligible. It is desirable that they should continue to lendto the best of their ability. Building societies have power to lend up to 100 per cent,of the cost or valuation of the house. They use these powers sparingly, but thereare cases in which 100 per cent, advances are appropriate, e.g., where an advanceis being made to the sitting tenant of a controlled house who is able to buy at lessthan vacant possession value. Local authorities, on the other hand, are limited by statute to the making of advances not exceeding 90 per cent. They have represented from time to time that this limit should be increased. If they wereenabled to lend up to 100 per cent, there is no reason to think that they, any morethan building societies, would use the power without a proper sense of responsibility.But it would enable them to give a greater measure of assistance to purchasersof smaller houses who cannot put down a deposit of as much as 10 per cent., andthis might be especially useful in helping older people. We propose therefore thatthe law be altered to permit local authorities, if they so wish, to make advancesup to 100 per cent, as building societies can.19. If the Cabinet approve the scheme as a whole, we suggest that a statementoutlining it should be made in the Debate on the Address. This will be necessaryin order to avoid the risk of a general hold-up on house purchase business; unless,following the Queen&apos;s Speech, it is quickly known which classes of borrower willdirectly benefit under the scheme, all borrowers will tend to hold back, whetheror not they are seeking an advance of as much as 95 per cent. Such a statement,&apos;is also necessary to enable formal negotiations on the details of the scheme togo forward with representatives of the building societies (the discussions so farheld have been in strict confidence and without commitment on either side^. Itwill then also be possible for the Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies to publish the rules to be made governing conferment of Trustee status on building societydeposits.20.  There will be such wide public interest in the proposals that we mightincur criticism if there were any undue delay in introducing the necessary legislation it is therefore desirable that the preparation of a Bill should be put in hand assoon as possible.
21.  This paper has been agreed with the Treasury as a basis for discussion.22. We hope that notwithstanding the difficulties about the rate of interestdiscussed in paragraphs 11-14 above our colleagues will agree to recommend tothe Cabinet:  (a) to give approval to the proposals set out in paragraph 5 above;(b) to agree to the making of a statement explaining the proposals during the debate on the Address; and(c) to authorise the preparation of a Bill to implement the proposals in thecoming session.J. M..H. B.17 th July, 1958.ANNEX BIMPROVEMENT GRANTSMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local Government and minister for Welsh AffairsThe Secretary of State for Scotland and I have already circulated our proposalsfor home ownership (Annex A). If our scheme is adopted, there should be asubstantial increase in owner-occupation, particularly of older houses. Many ofthese older houses need modernising to make them fully satisfactory homes, and theGovernment may be criticised if it encourages people to buy these houses withoutat the same time helping them to bring them up to date. Indeed, the Labour Partyin their proposals for future housing policy link the making of special advances tointending owner-occupiers with an obligation to improve the house.2. Powers already exist to help house owners to modernise their homes withgrants from the Exchequer and the local rates. These powers were originallyenacted by the Labour Government in 1949, but they were little used until theywere modified by a further enactment in 1954 (when the present Prime minister was Minister of Housing) and an intensive publicity campaign was launched toensure their wide use. This gave a big stimulus to the use of these grants, raising the number to about 40,000 a year in Great Britain, but despite continued effortssince then it has not been possible to increase this rate, though it has not fallen.I have therefore been at work on a revision of the scheme which would, I believe,result in more owners, particularly owner-occupiers, taking advantage of it.3. My new proposals have been agreed with the Treasury and with theSecretary of State for Scotland, who would propose, subject to modification tomeet Scottish conditions, that broadly similar arrangements should apply in thatcountry. They have also been discussed in confidence with representatives of thelocal authority associations in England and Wales and are, I think, generally acceptable to them. There may be some criticism from individual local authorities of the proposal (see details below) to take away from authorities their presentdiscretion to refuse to make a grant, but I do not believe that this will be serious.(The Secretary of State for Scotland will be discussing the proposals with the localauthority associations in Scotland next week.)4. I have also reached agreement in principle with the representatives of thebuilding societies that if the proposals for home ownership are adopted, then an owner who has bought a house under that scheme will, if within two years fromthe date of purchase he modernises his home with the aid of a &quot; standardimprovement grant&quot; (see paragraph 7 below), be lent the money he needs to payhis share of the cost of the works of improvement. The Treasury are sympathetic to this extension of the house-purchase scheme, which will of course involve some increase in the amount of Government loans to building societies in respectof pre-1919 houses.
5. The proposals outlined below will apply in their entirety to England andWales but only in part to Scotland. Broadly, the difference will be that while thenew arrangements for grants to private owners will also apply in Scotland, nochange is contemplated there in the present system of grants to local authorityimprovements. In addition, because of the differences in rent structure in Scotland,it would not be practicable to make any alteration in the permitted level of rentsto improved houses or conversions in advance of the 1961 revaluation.New scheme. The present provisions for making improvement and conversion grantswould be repealed and replaced by a new system. This new system would involvetwo main changes:  (a) Whereas at present there is no obligation on a local authority to operate the grant scheme, in future applicants for grant would be able to claimit as a right provided that they could meet the conditions set out below.If these conditions were satisfied, local authorities would not have discretion to refuse grant.(b) A &quot; standard improvement&quot; would be instituted, which would auto-matically attract grant up to a specified maximum amount.Standard Improvements7. The applicant would have to show to the satisfaction of the local authority that the house he wished to improve was structurally sound and was or would be ina condition of reasonable repair, and that it lacked certain standard amenities.These would broadly be the provision of a bath in a bathroom, an adequate hotwater supply, and an indoor W.C. If the owner then installed these amenities, thelocal authority, when the work was completed, would pay half the cost of the work as shown by the receipted bills (or other sufficient evidence) up to a maximum grant.At present it is envisaged that this maximum should be  150 if all the worksincluded in the standard improvement were carried out, lesser maxima being fixed for individual items forming part of the standard improvement.8. There would of course be cases in which some of the items included in thestandard improvement were already in the house, but not all. In such a case theapplicant for grant would receive grant pound for pound up to the appropriatemaxima for the absent items. It would be a condition of grant that if none of the items were in the house, the whole of the standard improvement must be carriedout, and that if some were there, all those necessary to complete the standardimprovement would have to be installed. This would mean that the presentrequirement that the cost of the work should be at least  100 would be dropped,since in some cases the cost of the items needed to complete the standardimprovement would be less than this sum.9. There might also be cases where the owner wished to carry outimprovements other than the &quot; standard improvements.&quot; In such cases theproposals for improvements would continue, as now, to be subject to approval by the local authority, but provided the owner was prepared to carry out a schemeto the satisfaction of the authority he would be entitled to grant up to the presentmaximum of  400.Conversions10. It would not be possible to have a standard conversion attracting a specified amount of grant, since houses suitable for conversion vary so much instructure and arrangement. As in the case of non-standard improvements,proposals to convert a house into more than one unit, or to convert other buildingsinto a house, would continue to be approved&apos;^ hoc bv the local authority as atpresent. The authority would, however, be required to p&quot;av grant up to a maximum of  400 on a pound-for-pound basis provided that the conversion was approved.Local Authority Contributions11. As at present,., local authorities would be required to contribute one-quarter of the total, grant from the rates, the other three-quarters coming fromthe Exchequer.
Local Authority Improvements and Conversions12. Grants for houses owned by local authorities in England and wales would be assimilated as closely as possible to the system of grants for private owners. The present deficiency grant would be scrapped and instead localauthorities would be paid three-eighths of the cost, i.e., the Exchequer share ofthe grant to a private owner. Where a local authority was carrying out the standardimprovements, payment could probably be made on a certificate by a responsibleofficer that certain costs had been incurred. For other improvement work or forconversions, costs would have to be approved by the Department before theExchequer share was paid.Conditions of Grant13.   Before grant could be paid on any house, the local authority would haveto be satisfied that it would, after improvement, have a life of not less than 15 years.The period during which restrictions attach to the rent and sale of the house asa consequence of receiving grant would be reduced from the present 20 years to10 years.Rents of Improved Houses and Conversions14. Most of the improvement grants made so far have been given to owner-occupiers, and that may continue to be the case. It is however important toencourage the improvement of rented accommodation also, and to increase theamount of accommodation available by the conversion of larger houses. Thedifficulty here is the limited rent which under the Rent Act landlords are allowedto charge if they undertake improvements or conversions with the aid of grant.In the case of an improvement, the rent limit is normally twice the gross valueof the property before improvement, plus 8 per cent, on the owner&apos;s share ofthe expenditure on the improvement. In the case of conversions, the rent limit istwice the gross value of the new unit of accommodation. In both cases, becausepresent-day building costs are high, there is a general consensus of opinion thatoften the permitted rents are too low to make improvement grants attractive tolandlords.15. To single out these cases to the extent of specifying higher rent levelsfor them, while leaving the Rent Act limits to continue to apply to other rentedhouses and flats, would in my view be too difficult to contemplate, especially so soon after the passing of the Rent Act. There would however be no such difficultyif provision were made for higher rents to be fixed by local authorities at their discretion. This would in fact be to revert (in part) to the position as it was beforethe Rent Act. I have in mind therefore to restore to local authorities in Englandand Wales the power to fix rents for improved houses and conversions, subjecthowever to a minimum equal to the permitted rent under the Rent Act.16. I am confident that Government supporters and the public generallywill welcome it if we eliminate what experience has shown to be the principalobstacles to a wider use of the present scheme. That is what my proposals are designed to do.  These obstacles are:  (a) Refusal of some local authorities to give grants at all, either for reasons of prejudice or economy.(b) Capricious refusal of grants to some individuals because the local authoritybelieve that the owner has sufficient money to carry out the workhimself.(c) Arbitrary reduction of the grant to a small proportion of the actual costof the improvement.(d) Long delay in getting agreement to actual proposals for improvement.(e) Discouraging effect of the present rent conditions on the improvement ofrented property.17. Legislation is necessary to implement these proposals. I do not, however,believe that it would give rise to much controversy. The Opposition are committed by their own legislation and by their current proposals on housing policy to theprinciple of improvement grants, and local authorities in general will welcome
the revised arrangements, because they clearly see the advantage to them of ensuring that houses are kept up to date and in good repair, and guarding against their slipping down into slums.18. For the reasons given in paragraphs 1 and 4, I also consider that theseproposals are essentially joined with the scheme for encouraging house purchase.19. I therefore ask my colleagues&apos; approval to the scheme outlined inparagraphs 6 to 15 above, and to the inclusion of the necessary legislation in thehouse purchase Bill.H.
