t(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)COPY NO.CABINETEMERGENCY LAWS (REPEAL) bill memorandum by the Lord ChancellorReview of powers in our General Election Manifesto in 1955 we pledged ourselves to eliminate &quot;wartime powers and regulations which trespassed upon Britishliberties&quot;.   We have already progressed a long way to this end and manyemergency regulations and enactments now in force (notably those relatingto the acquisition and use of land) are being replaced by legislation now or recently before Parliament, or to be introduced next session(Factories Bill).2.     The Emergency Legislation (Ministerial) Committee haverecently completed a review of those which remain, all of them in theeconomic sphere.   We must recognise that, in contemporary conditions,there are certain controls which no Government could afford to be without.   The object of the review has therefore been, first, to dispensealtogether with as many of the remaining controls as possible;  secondly,where powers must be retained, to freeze them so that existingindispensable controls can continue to be exercised but no new ones canbe introduced by any future Government without fresh legislation.   Witha few exceptions to which special attention is drawn below, no new powers are proposed.   The Home Affairs Committee have approved theEmergency Legislation Committee&apos;s proposals, and have authorised meto report on their behalf to the Cabinet.3.     Where all the purposes for which a particular Regulation or Actis still used can now be dispensed with, the Regulation or Act itself is tobe revoked (Annex A).   Where some of the purposes for which a power is used can go but some must be retained, the power itself is to be retainedbut modified so that it can be used only for the specified purposes(Annex B).   Subject to a decision on the Defence (Armed Forces)Regulations - paragraph 5 below - we are satisfied, after careful scrutiny,that we cannot do without the controls we propose to retain.   their number may appear substantial in comparison with those which are to begiven up;  but the real reduction in powers is achieved less by revokingthe powers themselves than by circumscribing the use of those which remain.Form of bill.     A draft Bill prepared by the Chancellor of the Exchequer isat Annex C.   The Bill:--1-C.(58) 16018th July, 1958
(a) sweeps away most of the emergency legislation on which theDefence Regulations at present depend (Clause l);(b) provides that certain specified Regulations, under which indispensablepowers are at present exercised, shall remain in force by virtue of the Bill itself (Clause 2);(c) restricts the purposes for which the continued Regulations maybe used to the purposes for which they are used now (first schedule);(d) continues in force (and extends - cf. paragraph 7 below) certain powers of the Minister of Supply at present depending on emergency legislation; and continues the Board of Trade&apos;spowers to trade in jute and jute products (Clause 3).We propose that, with one unimportant exception, the life of the Billshould be limited to five years.Defence (Armed Forces) Regulations5.     There is one issue on which we have been unable to reach agree-ment - whether or not to continue these Regulations, which enable troops to be used in civil emergencies, including strikes.   If we allowed theRegulations to lapse, troops could not legally be used for civil purposesunless and until an emergency had been proclaimed under the emergency powers Act, 1920.   This was the position before the war and some of usfeel that the decision to use troops in a strike is not one which should betaken lightly or made too easy.   On the other hand, conditions have changed and industrial situations may well occur in which it is necessaryto use troops, but in which it would be inappropriate (and perhaps evenultra vires) to proclaim an emergency.   In any event, officers cannot beexpected to give commands whose legal validity is in doubt.   Continuanceof this power by the Bill is likely to be contentious but, if we once let itlapse, it would be even more difficult to recover it by legislating in isolation.   We invite the Cabinet to decide this issue.Other points on the bill.     The Bill includes provision for the control of distribution and priceof goods, the supply of which has been interrupted by an externalemergency (as with the rationing of petrol during the Suez intervention).This provision will be found in paragraphs l(l)(d) and 8 of the first schedule.   Orders made under this power would be subject to affirmative resolution of Parliament.7.     Clause 3 continues the extended powers (to supply overseas governments, dispose of surpluses, etc.) conferred on the Minister ofSupply by emergency legislation since his original Act of 1939, but at thesame time (sub-section 2(e)) extends them further by empowering himto undertake non-military work at his research and development establish-ments.   This is the only wholly new power of any importance in theBill.-2-
8.     The Bill includes no power to control distribution and price ofcoal and coke.   If conditions next winter make it necessary, these powerscan be resumed by an amendment of the Bill.9.     The only emergency legislation which we shall not have dealt withif this Bill is enacted consists of one or two Acts which, though technicallyrelated to the emergency, are to all intents and purposes part of ourpermanent statutory code on, e. g. , rent control, and one or two whichwill automatically become spent with the passage of time.White Paper10.     The purpose and method of operation of the Bill are a littlecomplicated.   We therefore propose that a White Paper should be presentedearly in the 1958/59 session, explaining the effect of the Bill and itsrelationship to the annual cc--iinuance of emergency legislation.Conclusion11.      On behalf of the Home Affairs Committee, I invite the Cabinet:-(l)  to agree that a Bill on the lines of the annexed draft, subjectto any revision which may prove necessary, should beincluded as  a Main Programme Bill in List B.1 of thelegislative programme for next session; and that a white paper explaining its effect should be presented earlyin the session; and(2) to decide whether the Defence (Armed Forces) regulations should be continued in force by the Bill or allowed tolapse, either in December of this year or when the Billcomes into operation.K.House of Lords, S.W.1.18th July, 1958-3-
