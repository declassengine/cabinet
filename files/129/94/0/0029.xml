secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. September 1958C. (58) 179 Copy No.   654th September, 1958CABINETCIVIL expenditure memorandum by the Prime MinisterSince the Cabinet last discussed the level of civil expenditure (C.C. (58) 63rdConclusions, Minute 4) I have been considering what further action we might take in order to secure, in good time, the economies which are absolutely essential ifwe are to be able to give a convincing account of our financial stewardship.2. Economies cannot be achieved without difficult decisions of policy. TheChancellor of the Exchequer will shortly be discussing certain proposals with theMinisters concerned and I ask them to give him their full co-operation. I hopethat, in the light of these discussions, it will be possible for the Cabinet to reach decisions during October, as a firm basis for the subsequent scrutiny of the 1959-60Departmental Estimates.3. In addition, there is one type of saving to which all Departments can contribute. Despite great efforts, administrative costs remain too high, and wemust make a further resolute attempt to reduce them. I therefore ask all ministers to put in hand immediately a fresh review of the scope of their Departments andto report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer by 1st October what administrativeactivities they are able to curtail or eliminate. Some of these functions are relicsof war days; some are more recent growths. They may be useful, but not essential.A broad indication of where the axe could fall is all that is needed at this stage.I suggest that Ministers may find it helpful to give their Parliamentary Secretariesa special responsibility for ensuring that this review is carried out thoroughly andis completed by the specified date.4. Many Departments maintain, often as an unquestioned legacy from theneeds and circumstances of earlier years, certain activities which are of much
less value than they were when they were started. Each of these should bescrutinised rigorously in the light of the simple test &quot; If we were asked to institutethis service now, should we really think it necessary and justified? &quot;&apos; Unless the answer is clearly and certainly &quot; Yes,&quot; the fact that it may still have some valueor may be rather painful to terminate should not be allowed to stand in the wayof its elimination. Similarly, we tend to collect too much information and too many statistics either in an undefined hope that they may prove of some usesome day or because we started collecting a particular set of figures long ago and cannot bring ourselves to discontinue it now: Here again we cannot afford toindulge the inertia of habit, and we must make a fresh attempt to confine ourselves to collecting only such information as is of substantial and continuing importance.It is not a disgrace, even for a Government, not to know everything and not to beable to answer every trivial enquiry.5. I have given two examples of economies in administrative costs. If wecan succeed in reducing this type of non-essential expenditure, we shall savesome money and no less important we shall be able to concentrate time and effort on the essentials of administration instead of dissipating them on marginalactivities. I ask all Ministers to review the functions of their Departments inthe critical spirit which I have indicated.H. M.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,3rd September, 1958.
