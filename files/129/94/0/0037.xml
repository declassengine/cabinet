(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)....C.(58) 18710th September, 1958CABINETTINNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer the annexed note by the Permanent Secretary, Board of Tradedescribes the position that has arisen with the Tin Scheme.   Mycolleagues will wish to consider whether the effect of a breakdown of thebuffer stock arrangement on our relations with Malaya and Nigeria andthe imminence of the Commonwealth Economic Conference would be suchas to justify unilateral intervention by the United Kingdom in support ofthe International Tin Agreement.2. I feel that all of the practicable courses of action examined in this note are fraught with great difficulties and I am very doubtfulwhether we should embark on any of them.    Probably a loan to Malaya,if she wished to take action, would be the least damaging.D.H.A.COPY NOTreasury Chambers, S. W.l.10th September, 1958
INTERNATIONAL, TIN AGREEMENT;IMPENDING BUFFER STOCK CRISIS.Note by Sir Frank LeeBACKGROUND1. The Buffer Stock has to buy any tin offered to it at  730a ton.   It is already holding over 25,000 tons.2. The Buffer Stock&apos;s financial resources have been providedby (a) original capital contributions of  16.9 millions from six producing countries (Malaya, Nigeria, Indonesia, Bolivia, Thailand and the Congo)(b) a special supplementary fund -)  just over  1 million also put up in recent months by the producing countries (c) an overdraft from the Chartered Bankof  4. 5 millions believed to be secured on the whole of the Buffer Stock&apos;sthen holding of tin.3. The restrictions against Russian tin came into effect from30th August.   The hope was that they would relieve the immediate pressure on the Buffer Stock.   But it has always been recognized that the best hopeof the survival of the scheme lay in a recovery&apos;in American buying coupled with the full effect of the curtailment of exports to which the producing countries have been subjecting themselves since mid-December last.(These are to be intensified from 1st October to a cut of 50 per cent from the present cut of 40 per cent)4. It is known that a good deal of tin is being held off the market in the interests of helping the scheme - e. g. Consolidated Smeltersare thought to be holding something like 1,000 tons.   If there were a breakin price efforts might be made to realize some of these stocksbefore the price went to very low levels.THE IMMEDIATE OUTLOOK5 The Russians are entitled to a quota of 750 tons for the quarterbeginning on 30th August.6. But 835 tons of tin arrived from Russia shortly before30th August and are therefore not caught by the restriction.  Another 50 tonswill arrive in a few days time.  Another 1,050 tons (for which irrevocableletters of credit have already been opened) is ready for shipment, and some800 tons of this is expected to arrive by the end of this month.7. It follows that even if we were to take the unusual course of refusing entry to part of the 1,050 tons despite the fact that the wholeof this has been paid for, the following quantities would come on to themarket:-Tons(a) Free of quota 835(b) Counted against thecurrent quarters quota    750      i. e.    50 tons at sea plus700 tons out of 1,050 tons total...... 1,585 tons-1-SECRET
8, Therefore the Buffer Stock will in all probability have to beable to absorb at least 1,585 tons during, say, the next 4-6 weeks.9. On 5th September it was thought that the Buffer Stock,s funds would be completely exhausted.   But we understand that that afternoonthey were able to obtain a loan of  500,000 from Hambro&apos;s Bank.10. These resources will have been reduced by Buffer Stockpurchases on 8th September - the turnover of 360 tons on that day was abig one, and it is probable that a substantial part of this tin had to be bought by the Buffer.   As against this, some part of the tin sold to the Buffer may have come from the 835 tons referred to in paragraph above.11. It seems clear, however, that unless the Buffer Stock can obtain additional resources, it will be unable to support the floor priceof  730 a ton beyond the end of the week.   No one can be certain whatwould happen then, but the price break might be very severe (say, to 450 a ton).12. If the floor price is to be held until the end of the year, theadditional resources required (leaving on one side the favourablepsychological effect of undertakings of support) would be substantial -e. g. at least enough to absorb, say, 900 tons of tin (and possibly more)in the next three months, and to be able to absorb more Russian tin at thebeginning of the next quota period.POSSIBLE SALVAGE ACTION13. It is likely that producer members of the Tin Council will meet this week to discuss the situation.   But it seems very unlikely that theywill be able to put up additional funds.14. The United Kingdom Government are under no commitment tomake any finance available to save the scheme.   We have faithfullycarried out our obligations as a member of the scheme and took the lead(though perhaps late in the day) in restricting imports of Russian tin.15. A severe break in the floor price would be a great shock to producing countries, and the two Commonwealth countries involved -Malaya and Nigeria - might well expect the United Kingdom Government tocome to the rescue.    (A severe break in price would be particularly difficult for the small Chinese producers in Malaya. )16. Accordingly consideration has been given to possible ways in which immediate assistance could be given by the United KingdomGovernment if it were decided that this should be done.   The followingpossible courses have been reviewed:-(a) A guarantee to the BankThis would enable the Chartered Bank to extend furtheraccommodation to the Buffer Stock.   But the Treasury are advised that thepowers available under the Borrowing (Control and Guarantees) Act of 1946-2-
cannot be used to give a guarantee in respect of advances to an internationalBuffer Stock and that no other statutory powers exist which would enable this to be done.(b) Release of some security by the Chartered BankThe Bank&apos;s advance of  4. 5 millions is understood to be coveredby a lien on the whole of the Buffer&apos;s holding of tin at the time when theoverdraft was given (worth at current prices  16/17 millions).   But theBank of England&apos;s advice is that it would be fruitless to press the chartered Bank to release part of this security for other lenders, even ifthese could be found.(c) Loan to the Malayan Government under Section 3 of theExport Guarantees Act, 1949The idea would be to lend the Malayan Government, say, 1 million, or rather more with which they would support the Buffer.But (a) loans under the Export Guarantees Act are tied to United kingdom goods but a way might be found round this at the expense of somecomplication (b) Malaya has no immediate resources which could be advanced to the Buffer and recouped from the loan (c) the terms of the loanmight be thought onerous by the Malayan Government and a further advance by it to the Buffer would increase the risk of ultimate loss to Malaya ifthe price broke (d) it is almost impossible to believe that such a loancould be negotiated in time - i.e. by the end of this week.(d) A &quot;straight&quot; loan to the Malayan government this would presumably take the form of an advance fromthe Civil Contingencies Fund and ex post facto authority given by meansof a special supplementary Vote for the Commonwealth Relations Office.This would be straightforward but (i) it would be unprecedented so far asloans to Commonwealth Governments are concerned and (ii) the difficultiesat (c) and (d) above would equally apply.(e) Purchase of tin for the United Kingdom stockpileThis is the course urged by the Governments Tin Adviser(Mr. Waite) - i. e. that the Government should be prepared to buy upto 1,000 tons of tin.   This would be straightforward as far as time isconcerned.   But:-(i)  The bulk of the present stocks held by the Board of trade were financed by money voted by Parliament for thepurchase etc. of commodities for strategic purposes.But any purchase of tin now would manifestly not befor such purposes and would have to be justified openlyas a purchase designed specifically to support theprice of tin.-3-
sscrst238(ii)  Powers still exist enabling the Board of Trade to tradein tin and other commodities.   But Ministers have said in Parliament that those powers will not be used(except in the very special case of jute goods) andthe powers are due to be abolished in thenextsession of Parliament.(iii)  The purchase would be a very risky use of the taxpayersmoney.   There can be no confidence that the floorprice of  730 a ton will be held, even if such apurchase is made, and the likelihood would be that further purchases would have to be made or that 1heavy losses would ensure.    The United Kingdom Governmenthave indicated that they will not press for a reductionof the floor price below  730 a ton in the period up to31st December next.   But whatever is done in the nextfew weeks in an attempt to hold up the price, eventsmay well show that  730 floor cannot be held not-withstanding our undertaking.(iv)  If the United Kingdom Government show themselvesprepared to spend public money directly to support a given commodity price, the precedent would belikely to be very embarrassing.   If tin, why not woolor copper or zinc?(f) An appeal to the United States GovernmentThe United States Administration already hold an enormousstockpile of tin but has not bought any supplies since January, 1957.The United States Government are, of course, vitally interested inthe stability of Bolivia.   But it seems difficult to make an appeal to theUnited States Government to add still further to their holdings of tin inorder to support a Commodity agreement of which they are not a member,in the absence   of any action by the United Kingdom Government which isa member.   Moreover (i) the pre-war tin restriction scheme was bitterlyresented in the U.S.A. and tin has remained a sore spot with Congress(ii) it is very improbable that any immediate favourable answer would be forthcoming and (iii) we are likely to be in difficulties with the american administration over unacceptable proposals which they are currentlyputting forward or sponsoring in respect of lead and zinc.4
