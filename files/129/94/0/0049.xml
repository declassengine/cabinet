THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTO SEE AND  M$RETURN BY.BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet,... Sgptemben 1958C. (58) 19950//* September, 1958-Copy No.57CABINETOIL supplies memorandum by the Minister of power am circulating separately to the Cabinet a paper recommending an increasein stocks of oil held in this country. My colleagues may care to have as background to that paper a few facts about the part played in our economy by oil supplies and our growing dependence upon them.2. The following table shows the present value of the trade in oil to thiscountry:  (a) United    Kingdom    oil companies&apos; profitsearned overseas(b) Current earnings  from united Kingdom goodssupplied to oil com-panies:  British      ......American......  millions a year140(c) Oil for United Kingdomconsumption......(d) Increase in assets abroad(e) Change in United King-dom overseas monetary position       ......  millions a year3201001801004204203. Although the world demand for oil is likely to continue to increase, itdoes not follow that our participation can continue to be conducted on the favourable basis shown above.4. The demand for coal as a primary fuel has shown little increase sincethe war and at present it is declining. One of the results of this decline has beenthat the miners&apos; Union are campaigning for a restriction of oil imports.5. The following table illustrates the growth of oil imports, exports and consumption in recent years:  Exports and HomeImports       Ships&apos; Bunkers    Consumptionmillion tons million tons million tons1938        ......      11-7 1-9 9-01950        ......      19-2 3-4 15-31957        ......      38-9 9-7 24-754113SI^CRTET^
6. During this period our economy has been expanding and the demand forthe primary fuels consequently growing, but the share of oil has grown still more rapidly, as these figures show:-Total demand for primary fuels(million tons coal     Coalequivalent)1938     ......      189 931950     ......     225 901957     .....,     247 84Shares of Nuclear and oil     Hydro power(percentages)7 -10 -15 17. So long as we can earn good profits on our overseas trade in oil andmatch our dollar cost by earnings in other currencies, we do not feel any adverseeconomic results from our growing dependence upon oil. But that growth is sorapid that I am sure my colleagues would wish to take special note of the situation.M.Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,30th September, 1958.
