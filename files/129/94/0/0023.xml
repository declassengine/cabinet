secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   August 1958C. (58) 173 Copy No.26th August, 1958CABINETCYPRUS: UNITED STATES BROADCASTING FACILITIESMemorandum by the Foreign secretary as explained more fully in Annex A, the United States Government requestedus last November to provide facilities to enable them to install and operate in Cyprusa 500-kW. transmitter to relay Voice of America (VOA) programmes to middle eastern countries (known as Project Delta).2. This request has raised certain difficulties for us but in my view they arean acceptable price to pay for an arrangement which should, on balance, be greatly to our advantage.3.   The difficulties I have in mind are:  (a) an arrangement of this kind is workable only between countries whoseinterests and policies are closely identified. Such powers of control aswe shall be able to assume must necessarily be of a mainly formalcharacter: we can hope on occasions to exercise a modicum of restraint,or to influence the nuances of presentation; but we clearly cannot expectVOA to follow the British line where it diverges substantially from theAmerican. In the event of a temporary serious cleavage between the policies of our two countries, particularly in relation to the Middle East,the arrangement might give rise to difficulties and criticism, but our existing arrangements for relays from this country of the Voice ofAmerica have never led to embarrassment, and the risk here is Iconsider, entirely acceptable;(b) although, as Western voices, the VOA and the B.B.C. are complementary to each other in the broad political sense, they are in fact competitiveand we might be criticised for helping to boost a rival to our nationalbroadcasts. I think such criticism would be short-sighted. with increased power, the VOA might indeed draw some listeners away fromthe B.B.C.&apos;s Arabic Service; but any loss to us would be amplycompensated by the provision of a powerful distraction from CairoRadio and an additional Western voice;(c) the frequency used by the VOA from their present relay station, andwhich they would continue to use from Cyprus, is not allocated to the americans or ourselves under the Copenhagen Plan: and theresponsibility for using an unauthorised frequency in Cyprus for ProjectDelta would fall on Her Majesty&apos;s Government. After consultationwith the General Post Office my Department recommend that we can accept the formal position of delinquents under the Copenhagen Plan,for the frequency which we ourselves are already using for our Cyprusrelay is unauthorised; but it must be recognised that interference from&quot; Delta &quot; with the broadcasts of the Valencia (Spain) and Wroclaw(Poland) stations is likely to be appreciable. A copy of the technicalreport on this aspect of the matter by General Post Office engineers isattached at Annex B. We will ask the Americans to agree to minimise53937
interference with Poland in the manner suggested, but there is apparently nothing to be done so far as Spain is concerned, unless asatisfactory alternative frequency for Delta can be found on the medium wave band: and this in the view of the General Post Office is unlikely. This may mean that Spain will be less co-operative in thefuture about minimising the interference from their stations to theB.B.C. Home Services, which is most prominent in parts of Scotlandand the North of England. Departments&apos; views on this possiblecomplication are that the risk is acceptable in the context of the overalldesirability of promoting Project Delta.4. There are, on the other hand, good reasons for acceding to the Americanrequest. We should be demonstrating our confidence that United States and UnitedKingdom policy in the Middle East will continue to be closely identified. Weshould also, at no cost to ourselves, be giving the Americans a very practical measureof help in a project which promises a major reinforcement to Western broadcastingin the Middle East. Their present facilities are unsatisfactory and they have beenunder strong Congressional pressure to do something about them; and we shouldbe strengthening our own hand when we next want to obtain American support for some other enterprise in the information field. Lastly, it is in our general political advantage to increase the Americans&apos; interest in the future of Cyprus,and the deployment of fresh American installations in the island can be important from this point of view.5. Our negotiations with the Americans have reached the point where,although one or two questions of detail are outstanding, I am reasonably confident that they can be settled in a manner satisfactory to both sides without materiallyaffecting the project. On this basis, 1 am therefore inviting my colleagues in theCabinet to consider the question. I consider that its advantages outweigh thedifficulties that may arise from it. I propose therefore that, assuming a settlementof any outstanding points of detail, I should arrange for an agreement to be negotiated with the Americans subject to the points outlined in this memorandum and the Annex to it.6. It will take eighteen months or so to install the station. It is in both ourand the American interest to let work begin as quickly as possible if we agree inprinciple to the Project. It is for this reason that I invite the endorsement of mycolleagues at this stage to my proposal.S.   L.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,25th August, 1958.
ANNEX a project DELTAFollowing a proposal put to the Foreign Secretary by the United states secretary of State, Mr. Foster Dulles, during the Prime Minister^ &quot; inter-dependence &quot; talks with President Eisenhower, the State Department submitted toour representatives at a meeting in Washington last November a detailed request for facilities to install and operate a 500 kW. medium-wave station to relay to middle eastern countries &quot; Voice of America &quot; programmes transmitted from Washington.Cyprus is technically the most satisfactory base for broadcasting to the Middle East,and the Americans had failed to obtain facilities in Turkey or Greece, apart fromthose permitting the operation of their present inefficient floating relay station inRhodes.2. Early this year it was agreed by the Ministers directly concerned that weshould go as far as possible to satisfy the American request and, after consultationsbetween interests which included the Foreign Office, Colonial Office, G.P.O. andthe Governor of Cyprus, arrangements were made for Diplomatic Wireless Serviceengineers to collaborate with engineers of the Cyprus broadcasting station in a survey of the island with a view to finding sites for receiving and transmittingstations suited to the American requirements and acceptable to our interests.Various such sites were found in the Paphos area, and these were later inspected by&quot; Voice of America &quot;engineers, who selected a pair of sites in the extreme south-westcorner of the island. The joint Defence Communications Committee in Cyprus haveconfirmed that there is no objection to these sites from their point of view.3. The Government of Cyprus approve the project in principle and state thatthe acquisition of the land would present no difficulty. (The area involved is400 acres, of which only 50 acres would need to be purchased; the remaining350 acres would be subject to an agreement conferring &quot; pole rights.&quot;)4. The matter was discussed at a meeting of the United Kingdom-UnitedStates Information Working Group last month. During and since these discussions the Americans have:  (a) accepted that Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be bound to assume formalpowers of control over the output of the station;(b) undertaken, with reference to (a), to furnish radio scripts on request, forscrutiny post facto (advance indication of programme content would be derived from United States &quot; Information Policy Guidances,&quot; which areregularly furnished to the United Kingdom);(c) agreed to limit to Arabic and English the languages in which broadcastswould be relayed, on the understanding that we would be willingto consider any subsequent request for the use of an additional languageor languages (e.g., Persian): Greek and Turkish are specificallyexcluded;(d) accepted the contingent liability involved in the possible need to build arelay station for the local Turkish language programme of the Cyprusbroadcasting service, should it be found that this programme sufferedinterference from Project Delta;(e) undertaken to rely on Cable and Wireless Limited for their operationaltraffic to the full extent that the latter can meet their requirements;(/) accepted the need for a formal agreement between Governmentscovering these points and the status of United States personnel connectedwith the station; such agreement to be in addition to a licence from theGovernment of Cyprus.August 1958.
ANNEX BPROJECT DELTAReport by the General Post OfficeWe have studied the attached information forwarded by the Foreign Office,giving theoretical polar diagrams proposed for &quot; Project Delta.&quot; Our commentsare as follows:  (1) It is clear that two quite different orientations of the major beam are proposed, one southwards towards. Egypt and Arabia, and the othereastwards towards Syria and Eastern Turkey. No doubt it is theintention to provide phasing controls for the feeds to each of the fourmasts to give either one condition or the other according to programmecontent.(2) The Valencia station is bound to suffer appreciable, if not quite serious,interference at night-time.(3) The Copenhagen Plan station at Szczecin should be reasonably wellprotected when the South Beam is in operation, but would receive quiteserious interference when the East Beam is used.(4) The situation could be considerably improved, so far as Szczecin isconcerned, by rotating the position of the array to shift the wholediagram anti-clockwise by 10o. This would probably not affect the coverage of the station substantially and is a suggestion which might usefully be put to the Americans.(5) Copenhagen Plan stations occupying adjacent channels should not receive any serious interference.(6) The polar diagrams put forward are theoretical only, and the practicaldiagrams finally achieved may well be less satisfactory. nevertheless the aerial design proposed if modified as suggested should minimise the problems of interference. It is emphasised that, to maintainacceptable conditions, the phases and amplitudes of the signals fed tothe four masts will need to be held to critical tolerances throughoutthe operation of the station.August 1958.
