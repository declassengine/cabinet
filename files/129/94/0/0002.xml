secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  July 1958C. (58) 152 Copy No. 5915th July, 1958CABINETGOVERNMENT expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in my previous Paper on Government expenditure (C. (58) 111)1 undertook toreport again to my colleagues when further figures became available.2. In paragraphs 6 and 7 of C. (58) 1111 showed the Budget Estimates for thecurrent year and forecasts for the next two years as affected by firm decisions takensince the figures had been prepared. The resulting picture, as at May 1958, was asfollows:  1957-58 Out-turn      1958-59 Estimate      1959-60 Forecast      1960-61 Forecast 4,138 million  4,259 million*  4,391 million  4.463 million3. Revised forecasts of civil expenditure have now been received fromDepartments. They are higher than the previous forecasts by about  40 million for1959-60 and  70 million for 1960-61. The principal reasons for this are:  (1) an assumption of 2 per cent, unemployment instead of 1-6 per cent.;(2) an increase in the forecast costs of agricultural subsidies at their present levels;(3) an increase in the expenditure previously proposed for the Atomic energy authority?s capital programme.4. The figures in paragraph 2 provisionally included for the Defence budget in 1959-60 and 1960-61 a figure of  .1,465 million before deducting German aid(i.e., the same as in the 1958-59 Estimates). The Defence Departments have now prepared forward Estimates for 5 years of the cost of the defence programme on thebasis of present policies, and the figure before allowing for German aid ( 12 million in each year) is, instead of  1,465 million,  1,538 million in 1959-60 and 1,572 million in 1960-61. Though some reduction may be possible in these figureson the basis of existing policies, it is clear that defence expenditure cannot be contained at the present years level without some major changes of policy.5. The picture which emerges as at the end of June 1958 is therefore asfollows:  1957-58 Out-turn      1958-59 Estimate      1959-60 Forecast      1960-61 Forecast 4,138 million  4,259 million t  4,500 million  4,640 million6. As before, these figures in general assume existing policies (as at June 1958)and no change in the level of wages, prices, and other costs from the level obtainingearly this year.  They make no allowance for any change in the present level of* This is the Budget Estimate figure.

agricultural subsidies, for any difference in amount between the new general grant to local authorities and the total of the specific grants which would be paid without it, or for any change in the National Insurance Scheme.7. A number of decisions affecting expenditure have been taken since I circulated C. (58) 111. Some of them (e.g., extra expenditure on University awardsand polio vaccine, savings due to abolition of coal rationing and a rephasing of thecivil aviation works programme) have been allowed for in the above figures. Others(e.g., extra buildings for the school meals service, and larger awards for students atsandwich courses) have not: the latter class total about  3 million in each of the next two years.8. There are a number of other possibilities, of which some were mentioned inC. (58) 111 and some are new:  (a) Assistance to small farmers.(b) Advances in education.(c) Further expenditure on Cyprus, Aden and Malta.Ul) Extra expenditure on University awards as a result of the new Committee.(e) Increases in the pay of doctors, dentists, teachers, and police.(/) Increased expenditure on the Armed Forces as a result of the GriggCommittee&quot;s report.(g) Further services in development areas.9. It is now necessary to take into account increases in wages and prices.These have already moved up to some extent since the forecasts were made, andsomething must be allowed for the possibility of a further rise. Increases over thelevel at the end of 1957 of, say, 2 per cent, in non-industrial salaries, 4 per cent,in industrial wages, and 2 per cent, in prices, would add about  80 million to thetotal of Government expenditure.10. The above paragraphs take no account of the cost to Votes of any further&quot; reflation &quot; measures. These, if decided on, would be of a short-term nature,affecting expenditure this year and next.Conclusion11. I said in C. (58) 111 that &quot;&apos; if we are to contain Government expenditure during the remainder of this Parliament and have any chance of further taxreductions, we must continue to adopt a very severe attitude to proposals forfurther expenditure unaccompanied by corresponding savings.&quot; The revisedfigures certainly confirm this judgment. Yet our ambitions in most fields ofexpenditure are still growing.12. I shall shortly be presenting my colleagues with the results of my reviewof investment expenditure in the public sector during the next few years. I shallbe suggesting that it would be right to resume a moderate degree of expansion in investment. This expansion in investment, if my colleagues agree to it, will outpacethe probable growth in the national income, and for this I think there is a sound economic case. But of course the corollary is that other demands on the national resources must grow less quickly than the national income in order to make room for a greater growth in investment. On the above figures, Government votedexpenditure (of which only a small proportion represents capital investment) is far from fulfilling the necessary condition.13. I see no escape from the necessity of some important policy decisions.If they are to have any effect next year they must be planned now.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1,14 th July, 1958.
