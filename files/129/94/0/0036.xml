SALARIES OF SCOTTISH TEACHERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for ScotlandDuring the discussion of my paper C. (58) 177 about the recommendation,following arbitration, for an increase of 5 per cent in the basic salaries of Scottish teachers I was asked to provide more information about the status of the National Joint Council and the circumstances of the recent arbitrationhearing (C.C.(58) 70th Conclusions, Minute 4).    I now attach copies of thefollowing documents -Annex 1 -Section 79(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1946, which provides statutory authority for the existence of a council or other body to make recommendations with regard to the salaries of teachers;Annex 2 -The letter sent to the National Joint Council by my assessoron the council, containing in its final paragraph my viewthat no major change in circumstances had arisen sincethe 1956 salaries regulations were made;Annex 3 -The letter sent by the National Joint Council to theChairman of the Arbitration Tribunal explaining thecircumstances in which the tribunal had been appointed and the dispute which they were asked to determine;Annex 4 -The terms of the tribunals finding.I also attach in an appendix quotations from statements made by Ministers during debates arising from the dispute over the rejection of the Whitley Council agreement ona salary increase for certain National Health Service workers.2. The provisions set out in Annex 1 about a council to deal withsalaries of teachers in Scotland were first enacted in 1945 when there was already in existence a body called the National Joint Council which had beenformed by the education authorities and the Educational Institute of Scotland-1-(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)^ C.(58) 186 COPY NO,      &amp;^J10th September, 1958CABINET
(representing the teachers) to be available for consultation when salary-scales were being prepared under an Act of 1918.   The constitution ofthis body was then amended and the council approved for the purposesof the Act.   Each council lasts for a period of three years and is thenreconstituted.   On each occasion the Secretary of State approves thecouncil and its constitution.3.   The constitution of the council contains the following section -&quot;DECISIONSNo deliverance shall be made by the council unless arrived atwith the approval of a majority of the total representatives of the institute and of a majority of the total representatives of the Associations.....In the event of a deadlock a decision may be left to the Chairman, provided a majority of each side agrees to this procedure, failing which the mattershall be referred to a tribunal of three arbiters, to be appointed by theLord   President of the Court of Session. &quot;This was the procedure followed on this occasion and in accordancewith their former practice the council agreed, in deciding to seek thedecision of arbiters, that they would submit the determination of thetribunal to the Secretary of State as their recommendation.   Annex 3 sets out the detailed reference which the council made to the arbiters.4.   I would not dissent in substance from what is said by the Chancellorof the Exchequer in paragraph 10 of C. (58) 180 about normal arbitration and it is true that in this case, although the Exchequer bears 60 per cent of the cost of any award, the Secretary of State is not a party to the arbitration hearing.   But whatever may be felt about &quot;normal&quot; arbitrationthe hard fact remains that the procedure here has been accepted in thepast both by the council and by the Secretary of State to be arbitration and has been so described officially.   For example, on the only previous occasion on which the council found it necessary to refer a matter to arbitration the then Secretary of State in publishing draft r egulations referredas follows to the procedure:-&quot;the council were unable to agree what recommendations to submit.....and, in accordance with their constitution, the problem was referred to arbitration.   The arbiter*s finding, which have now been submitted by thecouncil to the Secretary of State as their recommendations, were inthe following terms.....&quot;5.   In view of (a) the nature of the distinction between&quot;proper&quot; arbitration and the circumstances of this case, (b) the general understanding held in the past and (c) the specific declarations which havebeen made on behalf of the Secretary of State in which the procedure hasbeen described as arbitration, it would, in my opinion, be extremelydifficult, if not impossible, to convince either the Joint Council, the profession or the public that there is any material difference between theprocedure used in this case and normal arbitration, &quot; --Z-S EC RET
6.   With regard to previous negotiations, only one issue has in the past been taken to arbitration.   The Secretary of State at that time accepted therecommendations of the National Joint Council based on the arbiter&apos;sfindings, though he suggested the inclusion in draft regulations of provisionsdesigned to lessen anomalies which had existed earlier and which would havebeen continued had the recommendations been applied in all respects.On receipt of representations, however, and after a meeting with thecouncil he decided to include in the final regulations, without modification,the scales recommended.7.  The Secretary of State has never rejected any major recommendationof the council though he has on occasion made minor modifications, forexample in 1956 he altered an agreed recommendation (in which arbitrationwas not necessary) for a flat rate increase of  55 into an award of  per cent in order to preserve relativities between the various scales.8.   I fully appreciate the Chancellor of the Exchequer^ arguments on thepossible repercussions of a 5 per cent increase though it should be pointedout that all the groups which he mentions have received salary increasessince the date of the last teachers1 increase.- Nevertheless, I- am stronglyadvised that the results of rejecting the council&apos;s recommendation willbe very serious indeed.  As I indicated in C.(58) 177, the existing machineryfor negotiation might well break down.   In that event I should have toendeavour to replace it with another council: but the teachers would in all probability decline to co-operate.   There would certainly be a prolongedcampaign in the Press and elsewhere and the effect on the special effortsI am making to improve recruitment to the profession would be mostharmful.   Morover in view of the attitude of the teachers in the past overthe increase in superannuation contributions, when they refused to collectschool savings - a refusal which they still maintain - it is very probablethat they would decline to co-operate in the school meal service and inother extra-curricular activities. Perhaps most damaging of all, however,they might refuse to shoulder the extra burdens of oversize or doubleclasses caused by the acute and growing shortage of teachers.9.   In the event of an increase being approved with effect from 1st October,no announcement need be made of the decision until the last few days inSeptember when 1 would issue a circular to education authorities withprovisional regulations.10. One point arose in our discussion about the effective date of thenext general revision of salaries.   In Scotland this is accepted to be1st April, I960, because, when the date of the last revision was brought forward from April, 1957, to November, 1956 the Secretary of Stateindicated that the settlement then reached should, unless there was a major change in circumstances, stand for the full period of what would normallyhave been the triennium.    In England, however, the then Minister ofEducation indicated that the settlement reached with effect from 1st October, 1956, should &quot;continue in force for the normal three-year period of time&quot; and 1 understand that this has been interpreted to mean that the next review will have effect in England from 1st October, 1959.J.S.M.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.9th September, 1958
Annex 2Letter from Secretary of State&apos;sassesor to National Joint Council25th June, 1958.Dear Sirs,I am directed to refer to the meeting of the  Negotiating Committeeof the Council (Committees B and C) on 14th March at which information was requested &quot;as to how far the cost of any interim increase which itmight be decided to award could be met from sums available in theEducation (Scotland) Fund&quot;.2.   As announced in Circular No. 156 dated 12th June (copy enclosed) therate of the rate-deduction  in the education grant formula has been reduced from 9d to 6d in respect of the financial year 1958/59.   With the rateof the rate-deduction at this reduced level it would still be possible in thefinancial year 1958/59 to meet from the Fund the grant of 60 per cent onan increase in teachers&apos; salaries within the limit of the present claim:the increase could, of course, be operative for only part of that financialyear, and its full effect would not be felt until the following financial year.The effect of the decrease in the rate of the rate-deduction will be thatthe amount of the rate-deduction, which would have been about  2,775,000if the rate of the rate-deduction had remained at 9d, will be about 1,850,000, representing a gain to the authorities of about  925,000.3.   In communicating this information I am asked by the Secretary of state to say that the Committee and the council will no doubt appreciate thatthe availability of moneys within the Education (Scotland) Fund is not theonly matter for consideration in deciding whether to reommend to himan interim increase in teachers&apos; salaries.   In particular he would remind the council that, as stated in the Departments letter of 31st October, 1956,the regulations which came into effect on the following day were made on theassumption that, unless there was a major changein circumstances, the scalesincorporated in them would remain unchanged until 31st March, I960.   In hisopinion no major change in the circumstances has arisen since that letter was written so that any claim for an increase would appropriately fall to beconsidered in the course of the next general review, which is due to begin in the autumn of this year.Yours faithfully,3cxxx3cThe Hon. Joint Secretaries, &apos;National Joint Council to deal withSalaries of Teachers in Scotland.Annex section 79(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1946Before making regulations under this section, the Secretary of state shall intimate his intention to make such regulations to any council orother body which includes among their objects the making of recommendations with regard to the salaries of teachers, being a council or other bodyconstituted with his approval by agreement between the education authoritiesand the teachers employed by them, or, failing such agreement, by him,and he shall have regard to any recommendations- made by the said council or other body.
Annex 3Letter from National Joint Council to Chairman of Tribunal of ArbitersEdinburgh, 28th July, 1958.W.R.. Grieve, Esq. , Q.C.Dear Sir,National Joint Council to deal with Salaries of teachers in scotland the Lord President of the Court of Session has been requested interms of the constitution of the above Council to nominate a tribunal of three arbiters to determine a dispute which has arisen in relation tothe salaries of teachers and intimation has today been received that he has appointed the following to constitute the three arbiters on the tribunal andthat they are all prepared to act:-W.R. Grieve, Esq. , Q.C., 38 Moray Place (Chairman)Ian M. Davidson, Esq., S.S.C., 10 Albyn Place, andC.W. Davidson Smith, Esq., C.A., 2 York Place.2.   The Education (Scotland) Act, 1946 (9 and 10 Geo. 6 Ch. 72) provides insection 79(2) that before making regulations under this section (which dealswith the salaries of teachers) the Secretary of State shall intimate his intentionto make such regulations to any council or other body which include amongtheir objects the making of recommendations with regard to the salaries of teachers, being a council or other body constituted with his approval byagreement between the education authorities and the teachers employed bythem, or, failing such agreement, by him, and he shall have regard to any recommendations made by the said council or other body,3.   On 11th December, 1956, it was intimated to the Secretary of State thatthe constituent bodies of the council had agreed that the council should continue as at present constituted for a further period of three years ending on31st March, I960, subject to a modification of the provisions in the constitutionabout arbitration.   This modification was that references should be madeto a tribunal of three arbiters appointed by the Lord President of the Courtof Session instead of to a single arbiter so appointed.   On 15th March, 1957,intimation was received from the Scottish Education Department that theSecretary of State had considered the position and had continued his approvalof the council under and for the purposes of sub-section (2) of section 79of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1946.   Intimation was also given that theSecretary of State had reappointed Sheriff Sir Robert Maconochie as chairman of the Council for the same period.4.   The council consists of twelve representatives of the EducationalInstitute of Scotland and twelve representatives of education authorities.Article 12 of its constitution provides that no deliverance shall be made by thecouncil unless arrived at with the approval of a majority of the totalrepresentatives of the Institute and of a majority of the total representativesof the associations . . . and that in the event of a deadlock a decision may beleft to the Chairman, provided a majority of each side agrees to this procedure,failing which the matter shall be referred to a tribunal of three arbitersappointed by the Lord President of the Court of Session.
5.   The salaries of teachers employed by education authorities in Scotlandare at present regulated by the Teachers1 Salaries (Scotland) Regulations,1956, (SI 1956 No. 1656 (S. 76)), copy of which is enclosed.  Amendingregulations were made on two subsequent occasions but the amendments wereminor in character.6.  At the meeting of the council held on 17th January, 1958, theInstituted representatives raised the question of an interim increase in the salaries of teachers and the matter was remitted to the appropriatecommittee.   The committee did not arrive at a recommendation and the .matter was finally dealt with by the council at their meeting on18th July, 1958.    At that meeting the Instituted representatives desired that having regard to the increase in the cost of living index figure   sinceagreement was reached on the recommendations which formed the basisof the 1956 regulations and having regard also to the increase in the rateof superannuation contributions now payable by teachers the existing basicsalaries should be increased by 7 per cent.   The Associations&apos;representatives intimated that, while they agreed that regard should be hadto the effect which increases in the cost of living had in determining the salaries of teachers, the appropriate increase on this occasion could not reasonably be arrived at by the method proposed by the teachers&apos; -representatives and that, having regard to past increases on a cost ofliving basis, an increase of 3 and one half per cent should be made onthe basic salaries of teachers    The Instituted representatives stated thatthey were not prepared to agree that the method proposed by theAssociations1 representatives for determining the cost of living increase was an appropriate one and that even if it were, the percentage increaseproposed did not adequately represent the position.   The respective sideshaving failed to reach agreement the question was raised whether a decision should be left to the Chairman but both sides indicated that they were notprepared to follow this procedure.   The council in terms of Article 12 oftheir constitution resolved that the matter be referred to a tribunal of threearbiters to be appointed by the Lord President of the Court of Session.Both sides agreed to submit the determination of the tribunal to theSecretary of State as the recommendation of the National Joint Council.7.   We have written the other members of the tribunal in similarterms and have advised them that we are communicating with you as chairman in regard to the procedure etc. in the arbitration regardingwhich we shafl.be glad if you could meet us.Yours faithfully,(Sgd.)
