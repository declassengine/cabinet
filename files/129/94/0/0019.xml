(TH-I DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 169 COPY NO.   ) \29th July. 1958CABINETLOCAL UNEMPLOYMENTNote by the Minister of Labourand National service circulate for the approval of the Cabinet a copy of a statement(Annex A) that the Presido-it of the Board of Trade wishes to make on &quot;Wednesday as a Written Answer to a Parliamentary Question.This draft statement which has been agreed by the Sub-Committee ofthe Economic Policy Committee of which I am Chairman, deals witha change in the policy governing the issue of Industrial DevelopmentCertificates and publishes a list of places where there is persistenthigh unemployment which would qualify for Government assistance under the Distribution of Industry (industrial Finance) Act (Annex B).2.      The statement was submitted for approval to the Chancellorof the Exchequer who was, however, unable to clear it before he left for Paris.I.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W.I.28th July, 1958
ANNEX a future I.D.C. POLICYWritten Parliamentary Question and AnswerQuestion To ask the President of the Board of Trade whether he is aware of the industrial congestion in certain parts of the country and of the needfor new industry in others and if he will make a statement.Answer As the House is aware, it is not the practice of my Departmentto issue Industrial Development Certificates - save in the most exceptional circumstances - to firms wishing to set up new factories in the morecongested parts of the country.   The certificates issued in those placesare almost entirely for extensions or efficiency projects which it wouldbe uneconomic to separate from the existing buildings.   I propose infuture to examine all sue&apos; - pplications, both for new buildings and forextensions, even more critically than in the past and to extend the practiceat present applied in the Greater London and Greater Birmingham areas to other parts of the country where unemployment is low.   I recognisethat this may mean refusal to allow a project to go forward in some particular place even though the labour could be found there.   But thereare other places where the need for new industry is much greater andit is these in particular that I should hope to benefit from this decision.I realise that the location of a new development in one of these placeswith high and persistent unemployment may result in a firm having tobear increased costs both in building the new factory and in connectionwith the movement of its plant or its key workers, or in the marketing ofits products.   It is precisely to meet this sort of problem that theDistribution of Industry (industrial Finance) Act has been passed, and forthe benefit of firms wishing to take advantage of its facilities I amappending to this statement a list of the places which we should regard as having at present a high rate of unemployment which is likely to persist.   Applications for assistance for projects in other places willnot necessarily be ruled out if they would relieve unemployment in the places listed.   From time to time we shall issue a revision of this list./List as set out in Annex B follows./These new arrangements mean that in places where there ispersistent high unemployment, Government assistance for new projectswill be given only by the Treasury acting on the advice of the development areas Treasury Advisory Committee.   Although the Development fund will not therefore operate for the alleviation of unemployment, it willhave a role to play in rural areas particularly in Scotland and Waleswhere the prevention of depopulation is the main problem.
