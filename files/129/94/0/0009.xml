;(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 159 COPY NO.26th July, 1958CABINETBROADCASTING policy memorandum by the Lord ChancellorDecisions are, or will soon be, required on the following questions:-(i)     . an additl?.al television programme;(ii)       the programme contractors&apos; profits;(iii)      television viewing hours;(iv)      commercial sound broadcasting service;(v)       subscription television;(vi)      (a)    development of music by wire;(b)    technical co-ordination between televisionservices;(vii)      a technical but very important question - theadoption of a higher standard of line-definitionresulting in higher-quality television pictures.2.     A Sub-Committee of the Home Affairs Committee have discussedthese problems, of which the first two are by far the most pressing.    Weare satisfied that the decision on the first must be against the introductionof additional television programmes - for which there is only immediateroom for one and, as yet, no real demand from viewers.   . On the otherhand, the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.), the independent television Authority (I.T.A.) and subscription television interests,including the cinema, have staked claims.    To tbe problem of theprogramme contractors immense profits, which are already attractingpublic criticism, we are satisfied that there is no solution with any realprospect of success under the law as it stands.3.     We cannot postpone announcing a decision on a third television programme and a refusal to introduce it will make us unpopular inquarters well able to influence public opinion.    On each of the other problems, the decision - whatever it is: and on (iii) and (iv) it could betaken by Ministers without difficulty - will bring us unpopularity in one quarter or another.    The question on which we invite the views of our colleagues is whather we should incur the odium of announcing our-1-S EC RET
decisions - in particular, on the third programme - and admitting purinability to curb the contractors profits or whether we should set up anindependent Committee of enquiry as a shield.4. The issue is a wholly political one, since we are satisfied thatwe could, in fact, find the right answers for ourselves, apart from the difficult one of the programme contractors&apos; profits.5.     The arguments in favour of appointing an independent Committeeare these:-(a) We could announce that there would be no third television programme pending the result of the enquiry, to whichthis and the other problems (including the contractors1profits) were being referred.(b) The enquiry would not be completed until after theGeneral Election.    The unpopular decisions would thenbe announced by the Government in office after theElection.(c) An enquiry, or enquiries, will in any case need to be heldin connection with the expiry of the B. B. C*s licence andcharter, which expire in June, 1962, and the future ofcommercial television, which is provided for onlyuntil July, 1964.    Even if the two enquiries weretelescoped (by a temporary extension of the B.B.C*slicence and charter without enquiry), it would benecessary to set up the enquiry not later than mid-1960and preferably earlier.    To extend its scope to cover the problems now facing us and to advance its date to,say, early 1959 would have the double advantage ofproviding us with a defence against unpopularity now and ensuring that we choose the membership and terms of reference, which are important, ourselves.6. On the other hand, we are impressed with the objections to appointing an independent Committee at the present stage:-(a) A wide-ranging enquiry of this kind would inevitablyarouse apprehensions of all kinds in the B. B. C. , theI.T.A., the programme contractors and, through them,the public - and this at a time when apprehensions will do us no good and when there is no real need to arousethem.(b) Conversely, we should get little or no credit forinstituting the enquiry, which could easily berepresented as a delaying tactic.    Nor is it by any means necessary: the pressure for a third programmed could be resisted on the ground that there is no public demand for it and we do not need an enquiry to find the answer.(c) If an enquiry were in progress at the time of the Election,we should be inhibited from claiming credit for theintroduction of commercial television.-2-
(d)    It is too soon after the beginning of commercialtelevision to start an enquiry into its future.    Asingle enquiry covering the current problems, the renewal of the B.B.C. licence and charter and whatis to happen when the Television Act expires wouldhave too wide a range and there are obvious objections to having two enquiries.7. We have felt that the political dangers of either course are such as to justify our bringing the issue before the Cabinet, whom wetherefore invite to decide whether or not we should announce in the nearfuture that an independent Committee will be appointed to advise on a third television programme, the programme contractors profits andother problems.    If a Committee is to be appointed, its terms ofreference might be:-&quot;To review the broadcasting services in the UnitedKingdom, including the dissemination by wire of broad-casting and other programmes and to make recommenda-tions: to advise on the future of the services to beprovided both by the B.B.C. and the I.T.A. and on thefinancial and other conditions under which these twoorganisations should conduct their services. &quot;K.House of Lords, S.W.1.25th July, 1958.-3-
