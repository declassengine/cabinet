Printed for the Cabinet.   September 1958C. (58) 178 Copy No.5th September, 1958CABINETCOMMONWEALTH TRADE  AND ECONOMIC  CONFERENCENote by the Chancellor of the exchequer am circulating herewith a Report by the Ministerial Committee on theCommonwealth Trade and Economic Conference and would be grateful for ageneral endorsement of the line which it is proposed that the United kingdom delegation should take at Montreal on the various topics mentioned.2. Annex A of the Report summarises a particular issue which has come before us about United Kingdom Building Societies. As the Committee were notunanimous on this matter we should value an opinion from the Cabinet on whether we should offer to introduce legislation to permit these societies to operate in commonwealth countries.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,3rd September, 1958.THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
REPORT BY THE MINISTERIAL  COMMITTEE ON  THECOMMONWEALTH TRADE  AND ECONOMIC  conference the Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference is due to open in montreal on 15th September. This report, outlines the position which it is recommended that the United Kingdom Delegation should be prepared to take up at Montreal on the main topics likely to be discussed.2. The main document with which the Conference will be concerned isthe Report of the Preparatory Meeting of Commonwealth Officials held in June.The agenda of the Conference is set out in the foreword to the Report by officialswhich is annexed to this paper (Annex B).Objective of Conference3. The agreed objective and the main issues round which discussion willrevolve are set out in the opening paragraph of the Report:&quot; 1. The principal economic objective of the Commonwealth is easy to identify and simple to state. It is to foster economic expansion throughoutthe Commonwealth. This must be based on more trade, more capital which involves more savings and more development, with special attention to theless developed parts of the Commonwealth. This can come about only in an expanding world economy and only if sterling, which is the currency in whichthe greater part of Commonwealth trade is conducted, is strong. From theseconditions it follows that Commonwealth countries must be concerned notonly with their own development, trade and currencies but also to encourageexpansion of trade throughout the world, to reduce trade barriers and topromote a continued strengthening of sterling.&quot;4. Nevertheless while the objective is clear enough, it is not easy to define or to reach agreement with other Commonwealth Governments upon the precisemeasures to be taken to attain it. There will certainly be difficulties therefore notonly of substance but of presentation, i.e., the Communique.Background Factors5.   The following main factors form the background of the Conference.(a) Commonwealth TradeAll will subscribe generally to the objectives of free multilateral trade, andno one will want a discriminatory Commonwealth bloc. On the other hand,in practice, some countries have made (Australia) and others are seeking tomake (New Zealand) severe reductions in Imperial Preference and showtendencies to want to be free to discriminate in quotas against British imports.Indeed New Zealand seems prepared to contemplate a denunciation of herOttawa Agreement with the United Kingdom for this reason. Although weare bound to face the fact that some members of the Commonwealth will makebilateral deals to dispose of their products, even if this involves givingpreferential quotas to the purchasers, and that we ourselves use dollardiscrimination which affects Canada, we might well urge the maximum non-discrimination in quotas and tariffs between Commonwealth countries.(b) European trade the Conference will meet against a background of uncertainty about theFree Trade Area. This will need mosf careful handling; at the meeting of officials there was great interest in this matter and a good deal of suspicionabout the United Kingdom&apos;s future policy. However this matter is handled and much of it is essentially a matter for official rather than Ministerialdiscussion we are bound to face very searching and close Ministerialquestioning at Montreal; and indeed we shall need to clear our line with theCommonwealth as much as we can if we are to avoid future hold-ups in our negotiations in Europe.
(c) World trade we may hope here that the prospect will be more assured than at the timeof the two official meetings, especially if the signs of United States recoverycontinue and commodity prices retain or perhaps increase their recent gains.This latter may reduce, but will not eliminate, the pressure for commodityschemes.(d) Commodity Policies and Agricultural ProtectionismIn present circumstances we shall be under pressure to consider commodityschemes for price stabilisation of primary products. We must recognise thatsevere short-term price fluctuations do cause real difficulties for primaryproducers but we shall have to avoid any general commitment either in respectof finance or of commercial policy which schemes such as these normallyentail. Our agricultural policies will also be criticised and although we have agood case, our statements on this subject will require careful handling.(e) DevelopmentHere the major problem is India. The arrangements made at the recentmeetings in Washington under the Chairmanship of Mr. Black, President of theInternational Bank for Research, and Development (I.B.R.D.), if accepted byall concerned, will provide both a reasonable assurance of India&apos;s solvency inthe short-term and an important precedent for similar cases in the future.We do not want development to be the dominating theme at Montreal,though some other Commonwealth countries may well seek to make it so. Butwe shall be under great pressure, and we shall have something to propose tomeet this (see paragraphs 14-18 below).(f) The Position of CanadaWe shall have to bear in mind that the Canadians will want somethingstriking to show, and, in particular, something which has a special bearing on Canada&apos;s position. This is why Canadian officials have placed suchemphasis on convertibility and non-discrimination as major themes.(g) The United StatesA Commonwealth Conference held in Canada will be closely watched bythe United States Government and Press. The possible consequence forrelations with the United States Government of any decisions taken, e.g., ondollar discrimination and the presentation in the United States of theproceedings of the Conference will need constantly to be borne in mind.United States suspicion of Commonwealth exclusiveness dies hard.(h) International Monetary Fund and International Bank for reconstruction and DevelopmentThere is little doubt that an increase in the resources of the international monetary Fund (I.M.F.) and the I.B.R.D. is necessary and would be widelysupported by Commonwealth Governments. The position of the UnitedStates is crucial, but now that President Eisenhower has publicly advocatedthis course the problem at Montreal will be simplified. But the ideas putforward by the President and Mr. Anderson, the Secretary of the United states treasury, concerning an International Development Agency have difficulties for us and further thought is being given to the line we should take both withthe United States and at Montreal.6. This is the general background against which we shall meet. We certainlycannot hope for any major immediate development of policy such as took placein 1932 and 1952. Nor indeed would it serve our interests to seek to secure one;the truth of the matter is that in many spheres Commonwealth policies are movingforward on the right lines. It is not new policies we need but more consistency in following our existing policy. This is not to say that there cannot be usefuldevelopments in fact we recommend some below. But it will be a usefulachievement if this Conference leads to a more effective system of Commonwealthconsultation and co-operation in economic matters.
Main Issues7. Against this background, comment is made below on some of the main issues which will arise, together with an indication of the line we propose to take on them.Freer Trade and Payments: Restrictions and Discrimination8. We are likely to get agreement that the policy of freer trade and paymentsagreed at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos; Economic Conference in 1952should be reaffirmed. But there will be pressure on the one hand to reducediscriminatory import restrictions against the dollar at a faster rate than we thinkwise, and on the other hand to retreat from the freer trade and payments policy by imposing or condoning further quantitative restrictions in particular cases.We propose to announce at Montreal a further reduction in our import restrictionson dollar machinery, a measure of liberalisation in Colonial dollar imports, andthe freeing of restrictions on canned salmon. These will be useful concessionsand we must endeavour to secure the maximum tactical advantage from them.Agricultural Protection9. Most Commonwealth countries will see agricultural protection as a greatimpediment to the expansion of world trade. We shall be urged to be less restrictiveourselves in order to afford to Australia and New Zealand the position in our market which they look on as the counterpart to the preferences they give us intheirs. Our case is a good one and we shall not&quot; go beyond assuring theCommonwealth that it is our intention to continue to increase agriculturalefficiency, to lower costs and so make it possible to reduce supports still further.A statement on this subject has been agreed between Ministers.10. We shall also be pressed to join with other Commonwealth countries inurging upon non-Commonwealth countries less restrictive agricultural protection and less damaging disposal of surpluses; and in particular to be prepared to join in seeking more realistic rules in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT) regarding trade in agricultural products. These things we shall be preparedto do within limits.European Free Trade Area11. These problems relating to agriculture come to a head in the attitudeof Commonwealth countries to the European Economic Community and theirfears of how the negotiations for a Free Trade Area may develop, which has ledsome of them to press to be included in the negotiations in some way. We shall haveto explain our agricultural policies at Montreal and in particular to make sure that what we may offer in Europe in respect of production policies and levels of support would not come as a surprise to them. It would be important, however,not to refer specifically to an &quot; understanding &quot; or to indicate its precise formbecause it would then lose all its value as a bargaining counter in the Europeannegotiations. This will certainly be one of the most difficult issues to manageat Montreal. We shall also explain to the Commonwealth how we see thenegotiations in general developing in the autumn, the issues with which we arelikely to be faced and how we should aim to handle them. We should hope thatthis exposition will give us cover for moving forward with the negotiations in Europe for some time without further detailed consultation with theCommonwealth.Commodity Policy12. Recent movements in some commodity prices, which have led to achange in the terms of trade against primary producing countries, have broughtabout renewed and lively interest among Commonwealth countries in the problemsof commodity trade. We agree that excessive and violent fluctuations in pricescan be to the disadvantage of both producing and consuming countries and wesympathise with the difficulties of primary producers to-day. But we believe thata high and expanding world demand is the best solution. The need for andpracticability of international commodity schemes can only be determined through a commodity by commodity study. While we approach this with an open mind,few commodities survive this test. We shall certainly be pressed to rejoin theInternational Wheat Agreement when it is renegotiated and we shall say that we
will play our part in the 1959 Wheat Conference, but our attitude to a new agreement will depend on whether we judge it to be of a kind which will dealwith the fundamental problems, in particular with production policy and the wheatsurplus. We are not the only Commonwealth country with cause to find theprospect of a rise in the world price of wheat distasteful.Liquidity and International Institutions13. Closely linked with commodity problems is the question of liquidity:whether the world has sufficient reserves to sustain a high and expanding level oftrade and the vicissitudes which must necessarily go with it. In view of the recentUnited States initiative, the prospects of securing international agreement to some increase in the resources of the I.M.F. and the I.B.R.D. are good, and we shallbe able to take note of both the need for this and the possibilities at Montreal. Theprovision of the Commonwealths share of the increased resources of these institutions, particularly in respect of gold, raise some difficult points which will bediscussed.Development14. An increase in the resources of the I.B.R.D. will be of major importancein ensuring the continued flow of finance for development since one-third of theI.B.R.D.&apos;s lending to date has gone to Commonwealth countries. The needsof Commonwealth countries particularly the under-developed ones for development finance are bound to be pressed at the Conference. The problem is whether savings can be increased to add to the flow of capital to the less-developedparts of the Commonwealth; whether we need special steps to channel the flow ofcapital in the right direction; and whether we are well organised to secure for theCommonwealth the best possible share of the capital which is available in theworld.15. We have had a prolonged study of various institutional arrangements(such as a Commonwealth Development Bank) by which capital flow might beincreased but we have not found anything which would deal with the problemsor which would be negotiable with the rest of the Commonwealth. The fact ofthe matter is that institutions do not of themselves generate either savings or capital.16. We have reached the conclusion that what is needed in practice isGovernment to Government loans which should be made available under a policywhich is selective, flexible and purposeful. We therefore propose that we shouldmake loans, under Sections 2 and 3 of the Export Guarantees Act in appropriate cases. We would not commit ourselves to any fixed annual rate or to the period of repayment. We must keep flexibility on both; what can be done from time totime must depend on world economic conditions, the state of our own economy and other similar factors. Such loans would be directed primarily to the needsof independent Commonwealth countries. So far as the Colonies are concerned,we propose that the Bill to extend the Colonial Development and Welfare Acts,which is to be introduced in the next session, should also provide for a new systemof Exchequer loans to the Colonies to supplement, within an agreed annual ceilingand for approved loan programmes, the amounts which Colonial Governments canraise on the London Market.17. These Exchequer loans to the independent and Colonial territories willbe an important departure from and adjunct to the policy set out in the white paper on the United Kingdom&apos;s role in Commonwealth Development publishedlast year. The Canadians have already told us of their intentions regarding aid to the West Indies, which we much welcome. We hope that Australia also willbe prepared to do more to help in Commonwealth development (not necessarilyby using the same means as we do), perhaps on a regional basis where their interestslie, e.g., in South-East Asia and the Pacific. The latest indications from Australiaon this point are not encouraging.18. The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (C.D.F.C.) has agreed to accept capital subscriptions from Commonwealth Central Banks or,if necessary, Governments to enable it to expand its activities in the field of privateinvestments, provided the Company retains its present private character and freedom from official control over its policies or from political influence on its investmentdecisions. We have approached the Commonwealth on this. We are alsoexploring the possibility of a line of credit from the I.B.R.D. to the colonial development Corporation and the C.D.F.C.
Training of Commonwealth Students19. It seems to us that considerable impact might be made at the Conferenceand in the communique if we outlined the very substantial efforts which havealready been made by this country to assist the education and training of commonwealth students, particularly in the field of science and technology, and indicated our intention that Commonwealth and other overseas students shouldcontinue to have a generous share of the increased opportunities which are nowbeing created in the United Kingdom for higher education. We doubt if theextent of our efforts is properly understood in the Commonwealth. other commonwealth Governments might wish to indicate also what they are doing,and we might consider together what scope there was for co-operative action toimprove existing arrangements.20. Since we informed the Canadians of our wish to raise this topic theyhave proposed a broad and reciprocal programme of Commonwealth scholarshipsand senior teaching fellowships totalling a thousand or more a year. Such ascheme has obvious attractions and merits our general support though we couldnot commit ourselves on numbers or other particular aspects until the universities and other educational authorities had been consulted. Indeed it could be argued that adequate provision already exists for university scholarships at undergraduateand post-graduate levels and that in order to make the best use of any extramoney available we should introduce into the scheme provision for such activitiesas improved training facilities for the teaching of English overseas. We proposetherefore to adopt a welcoming but flexible approach to the Canadian proposal and to suggest that a further study should be made by experts of the mostsuitable type of scheme from the standpoint of a collective efforfto meet the realneeds of the Commonwealth. This study might also examine other means bywhich co-operative action might be taken by Commonwealth countries to improveexisting arrangements for training students from other Commonwealth countries.In the handling of this whole topic we shall need some room for manoeuvre andsome discretionary authority for our colleagues in the light of the degree ofenthusiasm shown by other Commonwealth Governments.Commonwealth Consultation21. Finally, we think it would be desirable, and publicly attractive, toformalise the arrangements for Commonwealth economic consultation. the periodical meetings of Commonwealth Finance Ministers and Economic ministers would become a meeting of a Commonwealth Economic (Consultative) Council(or Agency or Organisation) and the various official meetings would becomemeetings of subordinate Committees of this body. We contemplate that it mightbe given a permanent headquarters in London; but not a permanent secretariat.We would propose also to urge at Montreal that within the framework of thisCouncil we should regularise and make annual the present arrangements for senior Commonwealth officials from the various capitals to meet together somemonths before the annual Ministerial meetings for authoritative discussion ofeconomic trends and policies.September 1958.
ANNEX A -Overseas Investment by United Kingdom Building Societies ^At the June meeting of Commonwealth officials it was suggested that theUnited Kingdom Government might take amending legislation to permit UnitedKingdom Building Societies to invest funds within limits in the Commonwealth asmortgages on housing there. Similar proposals had already been made by australian Ministers, when the Prime Minister was in Canberra.In favour of action to permit United Kingdom Building Societies to operate in the Commonwealth it could be argued (a) that the extension into the Commonwealth of the activities of UnitedKingdom Building Societies might act as a useful stimulus to localsavings;(b) it might reduce demands on the United Kingdom for help in financingCommonwealth development programmes involving housing;(c) it might be a popular gesture with Commonwealth countries and withcertain United Kingdom Building Societies.On the other hand (a) it becomes more difficult to protect the interests of the small UnitedKingdom depositors in the Societies if their activities are extendedoutside the United Kingdom;(b) there is still an unsatisfied demand in the United Kingdom for building society mortgages;(c) only one major United Kingdom Building Society is known to favour this idea; the remainder are against it;(d) legislation might therefore be somewhat controversial;(e) it is likely that Building Societies would make only small use of the facility,if granted, and any hopes in the Commonwealth of considerableinvestment from the United Kingdom through this means would be disappointed.
ANNEX BSECRETCOMMONWEALTH TRADE AND ECONOMIC CONFERENCE, 1958MEETING OF OFFICIALS, JUNE 1958FOREWORD1. We met in London from 2nd to 21st June, 1958, to prepare a report to ministers.2. We took as the basis of our work the communique issued after the meetingof Commonwealth Finance Ministers held at Mont Tremblant in September 1957and the memoranda circulated by Commonwealth Governments following our firstpreparatory meeting in February. The text of this communique and a list of thesememoranda are appended for convenience of reference.3.  The Agenda proposed for the Ministerial Conference is as follows: (1) The significance for Commonwealth countries of changes taking place in world trade.(2) Measures to expand trade between Commonwealth countries.(3) Progress towards the common objective of freer trade and payments.(4) Economic and trade problems in regard to agriculture and other primaryproduction.(5) Sterling area prospects.(6) The progress and direction of economic expansion in the less-developed countries of the Commonwealth and the sources of capital and technical assistance that may aid in their further development.(7) Arrangements for continuing Commonwealth consultation on economic matters.(8) The prospects and implications, especially for Commonwealth countries, ofthe European Economic Community and the proposed Free trade area.4. Explanatory notes on this Agenda are contained in an appendix to our report.5. In addition to the report which follows, the other documents before ministers in September will be:  (i) Up-to-date assessments of (a) recent world economic developments;(b) sterling area prospects.(ii) Background memorandum by the Commonwealth Economic Committeeon Commonwealth Trade, 1950-57.(iii) Reports by the Commonwealth Economic Committee on (a) the improvement and expansion of the Committee&apos;s existing work;(b) an extension of the Committee:s activities into new economic fields.6.   A particularly secret report relating to gold has also been prepared.7.   In order to expedite our discussions, we set up three Committees:  (i) a Steering Committee, to consider general problems;(ii) a Committee on Trade Policy;(iii) a Committee on Financial Policy and Development.A number of Working Groups were also ,set up. Our report reflects this organisation, but most of the sections are self-contained.8. We propose to meet again from 11th to 13th September in Montreal toundertake a final review of the material for Ministers immediately before theConference opens.London, S.W. 1,21st June, 1958.SECRET53623 a

I.-introduction. The principal economic objective of the Commonwealth is easy to identifyand simple to state. It is to foster economic expansion throughout theCommonwealth. This must be based on more trade, more capital which involvesmore savings; and more development, with special attention to the less developedparts of the Commonwealth. This can come about only in an expanding world economy and only if sterling, which is the currency in which the greater part of commonwealth trade is conducted, is strong. From these conditions it follows that Commonwealth countries must be concerned not only with their owndevelopment, trade and currencies but also to encourage expansion of tradethroughout the world, to reduce trade barriers and to promote a continuedstrengthening of sterling.2. These goals cannot be achieved unless Commonwealth countries pursuethem in close collaboration both among themselves and with other countries whichhave broadly similar interests. Because of their close links and their establishedhabits of working together, consultation and co-operation between commonwealth countries have a special importance. The machinery for consultation is alreadyextensive and works well, but certain suggestions for improving it are containedin this report. It must also be recognised, however, that co-operation with theUnited States, with European countries, and with international institutions willbe essential if these purposes are to be fulfilled. How this co-operation could best be achieved will require consideration at Montreal.3. We have met at a time both of uncertainty and of opportunity. In part the uncertainty arises because of the recession in the United States, a recessionwhich has cut more deeply than any since the end of the war, and which willhave increasingly serious repercussions for the rest of the world the longer itcontinues. At the same time there has been some tendency for the growth ofindustrial production in other countries to slow. down. We shall reassess theposition before Ministers meet.4. These developments have led some countries to suffer from the fallingprices commanded by many primary commodities and this in turn has accentuatedthe problems of inadequate reserves and inadequate flows of external capitalrequired to sustain the progress of much needed development programmes.Finally, there is doubt about the outcome of the Common Market in Europe andof the negotiations for a European Free Trade Area. All this has led to a revival of fears for the success of the move to freeing trade and payments, of the possibilityof a return to restriction, and the formation of discriminatory regional blocs.5. On a recent assessment of prospects for the sterling area it appeared thatthe area as a whole might prove to be roughly in balance with the rest of the worldduring 1958. This forecast allowed for a sizeable deficit on current account beingroughly offset by an inflow of non-sterling capital on both public and privateaccount. Within this total picture a very substantial current surplus on the partof the United Kingdom would have been more than matched by a current deficit in the rest of the sterling area, the gap being bridged by capital inflow. However,the trend since that assessment was made gives rise to doubts whether the netoutcome for the year will be even as favourable as this. This too will be reassessedbefore Ministers meet.6. Despite these uncertainties the time is not without its opportunities. Forexample the pound sterling is now stronger and the United Kingdom&apos;s reserveshave grown. The urge to expansion in many countries has not wavered and this in itself is a hopeful factor, provided it is coupled with stability of currencies.International institutions like the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment (I.B.R.D.) and the International Monetary Fund (I.M.F.) have beenplaying an increasingly important role. Above all, there are signs of renewedco-operation by the United States in the foreign economic field through trade,promotion of capital flows and a disposition to strengthen the international institutions.7. Meanwhile economic trends during the past few years have brought intosharper focus a number of basic problems which perhaps have hitherto receivedinsufficient attention.   The scarcity of liquid reserves limits expansion of trade
and curbs development programmes. The amounts of capital that would berequired by the less-developed countries, if their economic growth were to go forward at a rate tolerable to their Governments and peoples, have proved to bemuch larger than expected, while the scarcity of capital throughout the worldhad also been insufficiently realised. For some of the countries committed toprogrammes of economic growth, these problems have been complicated by theirnecessary reliance on only a few commodity exports. Many Delegations stressed the difficulties created for them by wide fluctuations in commodity prices, byprotectionism, and by the declining ratio of the value of exports of primarycommodities to the value of total world trade. Some means should be found,they urged, to make their earnings from the export of such commodities moredependable.8. In the light of all these circumstances, we have considered what initiativesmight profitably be taken at the forthcoming Commonwealth Conference. our conclusions are set out- in full in the succeeding sections of our report. Here we wish to mention only a few of the possible initiatives that we have discussed.They are singled out for special notice either because of their intrinsic importanceor because they require particularly careful consideration by commonwealth governments before the Conference meets.9. Some of us thought that the moment presented a challenge and that itmight be opportune for a decisive move to implement the declared objective of extending a multilateral system of trade and payments over the widest possiblearea and of establishing full convertibility of sterling. It was suggested that, evenif no action on convertibility was taken, one of the outcomes of the conference should be a decisive announcement by Commonwealth Governments either thatthey were putting an end to discrimination forthwith or that they had decided onits entire elimination over a short period of time. In support of this proposal itwas urged that there was no longer economic justification for discrimination by various Commonwealth countries against dollar suppliers and that a morefavourable occasion for taking such action was unlikely to occur. Others, however,argued that the complete removal of discrimination must be a matter of timing and judgment. Where discrimination damaged efficiency, there was a strong case for abolishing it even at some immediate cost to the balance of payments. Thedecision in this matter lay with individual countries, and among factors to betaken into account by them in forming a judgment would be the state of theUnited Kingdom reserves, their own balance of payments, the balance of payments of the sterling area as a whole, and the probable duration of the United Statesrecession. It was very important that any forward move should be capable ofbeing sustained. It was agreed that this matter should be reviewed by commonwealth Governments in the interval before the Conference meets inSeptember.10. Consideration was given to the serious problems involved for commonwealth countries by the prevalence of wide fluctuations in somecommodity prices and by the impact of agricultural protectionism. It was agreedthat the need for action in this field was urgent and important, and that in viewof this, Commonwealth Governments should examine, commodity by commodity,what steps could be taken, through existing commodity schemes or otherwise, tobring about a moderation in price swings, and so more stable conditions for trade.It was also agreed that urgent attention be paid to the way in which agriculturalprotectionism is increasingly distorting the pattern of international trade andcausing hardship to many of the more efficient producers of agricultural commodities.11. The capital requirements of the less-developed countries are large and urgent; they are a matter of special concern to the Commonwealth as a whole.We have paid special attention to means by which these requirements can bemore fully met and have considered a number of ideas for new institutions andfor increased use of existing institutions. Among these ideas has been the proposalfor a Commonwealth Bank. This proposal has certain advantages but it is alsoattended by difficulties. Much depends upon the extent to which it could mobiliseadditional savings either from within the Commonwealth or elsewhere. Thereis also a question whether the establishment of such an institution might not leadto a reduction in lending to Commonwealth countries by the I.B.R.D. ministers may wish to examine this issue in the widest Commonwealth context.
12. It was agreed that the ability of the I.B.R.D. to borrow should beincreased so that it might continue to provide assistance to under-developed andother countries on a larger scale. It was the general view that the quotas ofmembers of the I.M.F. should be increased as a means of introducing a higherdegree of liquidity into world transactions and also providing some cushion againstthe effects of fluctuations in commodity prices. For the success of these measures,however, action by the United States Congress is needed. Therefore in this matter,there are two points to which we draw particular attention: (a) The need for care in public handling of these matters between now andthe Conference;(b) The need for careful consideration of the presentation of these mattersat and after Montreal in the light of developments between then and now.13. We have been heartened by the degree of agreement that has beenreached at this meeting of officials. Commonwealth Governments will, of course,want to reconsider and re-define their positions and may also want to re-shapesome of the proposals that have been put forward.- We feel confident, however,that there is material in the succeeding sections of our report capable of beingfashioned into a successful initiative to be taken at the Commonwealth Conferencein September an initiative which could be of major importance in fostering an expanding Commonwealth in an expanding world economy.II.-FREER TRADE AND PAYMENTS14. It is our firm belief that Commonwealth countries should continue towork to achieve a multilateral trade and payments system over the widest possiblearea. Such a policy unites the Commonwealth, links it more closely with the restof the world and thus helps to strengthen the world economy to the advantage ofall Commonwealth countries.15. The Canadian Delegation suggested that a combination of events might lead to conditions being suitable over the next few months for a move tothe formal convertibility of sterling and that even if no action on convertibilitywere taken, there might be agreement at the Montreal Conference either toremove all discrimination against the dollar at a single step or to establish a purposeful short-term programme for its elimination. In their view, continueddiscrimination was not justified on balance of payments grounds; it frustratedCanadian access to Commonwealth markets for which she had granted valuableprivileges in the Canadian market; it was contrary to the interests of the importing countries themselves; and was inconsistent with a general system of multilateraltrading. They also suggested that fhe movement of events and opinions in 1958.in the United States might make particularly appropriate a Commonwealth initiativetowards non-discrimination.16. There was general agreement that the timing of a move to formalconvertibility of the pound was a matter of judgment and that this judgment mustbe exercised by the United Kingdom. There was also general agreement that withthe present degree of convertibility of the pound, the case for continueddiscrimination against dollar payment was substantially weakened. The UnitedKingdom and some other Delegations felt unable to recommend an immediate, or indeed a timed, commitment to remove discrimination. These Delegationsconsidered that where discrimination damaged efficiency there was a strong case for abolishing it even at some immediate cost to the balance of payments; but ifabolition placed additional strains upon the balance of payments by causingabsolute increases in the value of imports, it was very doubtful whether the sterling area was yet in a position to shoulder such a burden. In such a situation, alternative courses might be to increase restrictions against other currencies to compensate forrelaxations of dollar discrimination or to take additional disinflationary action toreduce the demand for imports in order to eliminate discrimination. In their view,both these courses seemed inconsistent with their general policies and likely in thelong run to work against the interests of those countries which desired a rapid move towards the removal of discrimination. The decision lay with individual countriesin this matter and among the factors to be taken into account by them in forming a judgment would be the state of the United Kingdom reserves, their own balance
of payments, the balance of payments of the sterling area as a whole and the possibleduration of the United States recession. The general objective should be tocontinue to remove discrimination as rapidly as was consistent with prudence,bearing in mind the importance of being able to sustain any forward move.17. In all this there was no disagreement on fundamental policy; differenceswere of emphasis, of timing and of judgment. We recommend to Ministers thatthey should review the position of their Governments on these matters in order thatthey may be fully discussed at the Conference.18. We also discussed further a proposal, which had been considered by commonwealth Governments before, that a body might be set up composed of senior officials from Commonwealth countries, the United States, european countries, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the I.M.F., todiscuss in a single forum the problems of world trade and finance. This proposal has, however, come up against the obstacle that the United States, which mustnecessarily be a fully participating member of any such group, has strong objectionsto making formal arrangements, outside existing international institutions, for consultation on matters of broad economic policy. The Western european countries, whose co-operation is also essential, have also shown no enthusiasm for setting up such a group. In addition, it is becoming increasingly clear that countries are hesitant to agree to regional representation; and such a body, if it were to consist of representatives of all countries having an important interest in world trade and payments, would become something approaching a world economicconference. One possibility is that use could be made of the I.M.F. and, inparticular, of its annual meeting to bring about discussion at a high official levelof these problems.19. It is evident from many passages in the report that it will be important to secure co-operative action on the part of the United States Government and ofEuropean Governments. How to secure this co-operation involves a number of questions. Should it be sought comprehensively on all such issues, or should it besought on individual issues? Should it be sought collectively by the Commonwealth,individually by the Commonwealth Governments concerned or by action throughthe existing international institutions? These are questions of considerabledelicacy which will call for consideration by Ministers; in the meantime no publicity should be given to any idea of an approach to the United States or to europe.III.-TRADE20. About half of the total trade of the Commonwealth is exchanged withinthe Commonwealth and half with the rest of the world, and it must be the aim ofevery Commonwealth Government to foster trade both within and outside theCommonwealth. All other considerations apart, Commonwealth countries cannothope to flourish by endeavouring to develop trade between themselves alone; world markets are vital, particularly to provide outlets for the expanding production which must.be envisaged if standards of living are to be protected and improved.In accordance with conclusions reached in previous Commonwealth deliberationsit is not intended, nor is it desirable, to seek the creation of a discriminatoryCommonwealth economic bloc.21. We recommend that against this background Ministers should considerall the possible measures which Commonwealth Governments might take to expandthe trade of Commonwealth countries with one another and with the rest of theworld, while seeking to avoid excessive short-term fluctuations in commodity prices.IV.-INTRA-COMMONWEALTH TRADE22. We found it convenient to deal with a number of matters under this general heading, although many of them arise equally in trade with the rest of theworld.Tariff Preferences and Trade Agreements23. The principal method by which Commonwealth countries assist their trade with one another is the system of tariff preferences which was fully developedat the Ottawa Conference in 1932.   Since then many preferences have been reduced
under agreements with foreign countries, and the &quot; specific &quot; preferences have lostvalue with the fall in the value of money, thereby reducing the effectiveness of someintra-Commonwealth agreements. Commonwealth Governments, in negotiatingthe GATT, agreed that they should no longer be free to accord increased preferencesto one another, although existing preferences could be maintained. The extent towhich different Commonwealth countries give preference to one another variesconsiderably, and there is in some instances a lack of balance. In other cases thebalance has changed. More recently a number of Commonwealth governments have reduced the level of preferences accorded by them and further modifications in the preferential system may be found necessary from time to time. Nevertheless,the continued existence of a wide field of preferences in intra-Commonwealth tradeis of real importance. It would be desirable to reaffirm the importance of the rolethat preferences have played, and continue to play, in Commonwealth economic relations.24. Furthermore, we recommend that Commonwealth countries should take every opportunity to negotiate with one another with a view to encouraging their trade and should, if appropriate, renegotiate their bilateral preferential agreements to ensure their continuing usefulness. It was felt that wherever possibleCommonwealth Governments, subject to the limitations which they have acceptedunder their GATT obligations, should extend equally to the trade of all other commonwealth countries any new tariff benefits resulting from these negotiations.Possibility of revalorising &quot; specific &quot; tariff preferences25. It has been represented that it would be in keeping with the &quot; spirit&quot; ofthe no-new-preference role of the GATT that Commonwealth Governments shouldbe allowed to restore these preferences to the ad valorem incidence which they had before the war. This proposition has been considered jointly on other occasionsby Commonwealth Governments and the view then taken was that it stood no chance of being accepted by the Governments of other countries which would beinjured by such a change; it was also thought that Commonwealth interests wouldbe injured by the revalorisation of bound &quot; specific &quot; duties in the tariffs of othercountries, particularly the United States, which could be a likely corollary. Wehave considered the matter again and it appears to us that these conclusions stillhold good.Removal of trade barriers26. In general, thanks to the use of sterling and long-established economiclinks, trade flows fairly freely between Commonwealth countries, but there are anumber of barriers to which attention must be drawn. These include the use of tariff and other devices to protect domestic industries, the widespread use ofagricultural support arrangements, and the application by most countries from timeto time since the war of quota restrictions for balance of payments reasons. special problems -have also arisen as the result of efforts to accelerate the pace ofdevelopment in certain parts of the Commonwealth.(i) Tariff protectionCommonwealth Governments have generally recognised the desirability ofgiving tariff protection only to industries which appear likely to prove economic or are of strategic importance and of fixing the tariff as low as possible, consistent withthe provision of adequate protection for the industry concerned. It is desirablethat Commonwealth Governments should endeavour to ensure that trade withother Commonwealth countries is not unnecessarily affected through the applicationof protective duties, e.g., care might be taken in defining the goods concerned, andthe duties should not be applied over a wider range of goods than necessary.Special attention should be paid to any difficulties in this respect (e.g., where anincrease in the duty on foreign goods is necessary but will result in a higher rate than is needed against Commonwealth imports). In all such cases theCommonwealth Government concerned will no doubt seriously consider thepossibility of taking some alternative action, consistent with its international obligations, which might achieve the desired aim without doing needless injury to commonwealth trade.
Position of the less-developed countries27. The special difficulties of countries in the process of economic developmenthave been recognised in Article XVIII of the revised GATT and nothing in thepreceding sub-paragraphs relating to trade barriers is intended to prejudice the flexibility and freedom conceded to such countries.Encouragement of intra-Commonwealth trade by other methods28. Commonwealth Governments stimulate and encourage intra-Common-wealth trade in a considerable number of specific ways which we should aim toextend and develop:(a) Government services. These provide active help and information toexporters in their search for trade openings (and these services arereadily made available to other Commonwealth countries if they do not possess their own).(b) Tourism. Most Commonwealth Governments have official organisations for the development of tourist facilities, and their information and experience is gladly made available to the corresponding agencies ofother Commonwealth countries.(c) Trade missions. Much is already done, but more could still be done, by commonwealth Governments with the help of leading business men intheir country to stimulate maximum keenness in industry to win more(ii) Agricultural support, arrangementsOne of the most striking features in the post-war years has been the way inwhich international trade in agricultural products has been distorted by the wideuse of agricultural support arrangements in most countries along with the use ofquota restrictions and other practices to which they lead. Such supports have also had adverse effects on intra-Commonwealth trade in these products and on the economies of some Commonwealth countries. Suggested action by commonwealth governments in this field is discussed in paragraphs 58-59 below.(iii) Quota restrictions(a) General balance of payments restrictionsAll Commonwealth Governments recognise that, in a balance ofpayments crisis, quota restrictions may be applied in order to bring thesituation quickly under some measure of control. Quota restrictions,however, are not a lasting solution to the problem. In so far as the causes of imbalance are internal, the remedies must primarily be soughtthrough appropriate monetary and fiscal policies. In so far as the causes are to be found in the policies of other countries, action primarily by these countries will be necessary to remove or alleviate the adversefactors operating. In the meantime it is necessary to watch thatuneconomic industries do not develop to replace goods which cannotbe imported. This matter is covered by appropriate articles in the gatt to which Commonwealth countries have subscribed. We wishto underline the importance of non-discrimination in the administrationof quota restrictions. The establishment of restrictive quotasautomatically creates apparent opportunities for trade bargains betweenthe countries which apply such restrictions; for each can give additionalimport quotas in exchange for similar concessions to its own exports.It may be impossible in some cases to avoid discriminatory arrangementsbut in general the administration of quota restrictions should not be such as to give unduly favourable trade opportunities to another country at the expense of any Commonwealth country whose trade in the classof goods concerned is being restricted.(b) Restrictions against imports from dollar countriesWe discussed the trade aspects of this issue at some length.The general conclusion of the whole matter is summarised inparagraphs 15-17 above.
business in Commonwealth markets; trade missions, suitably organised and planned, and backed by strong and continuing publicity, can sparkoff a more general selling effort by industry.id) Trade fairs. Participation in trade fairs can also be supported by officialaction.ie) Business visitors. Customs administration can be conducted in a manner that will not discourage the business visitor and the tourist, and ingeneral Government policies in respect of the admission of businessvisitors from other Commonwealth countries have important effectsupon the expansion of trade.if) Government purchases. In the field of Government purchases generallyCommonwealth Governments should, if necessary, issue instructions toensure that when Government requirements are obtained from abroadthe fullest possible opportunity is given to suppliers in other commonwealth countries. The Pakistan Delegation stated that their government might have to depart from this practice for special reasons connected with the disposal of surplus commodities.Shipping29. The important part which shipping plays in the growth of commonwealth trade was discussed. Attention was drawn to the need for the provision of shipping services adequate for the requirements of trade. Representatives of some commonwealth countries drew attention to some apparent anomalies in existingfreight rates and the effect which these might have on the ability of producers to compete in international trade.30. Shipping services are international in character and must be operated onan economic basis. The study of the differences in costs and services of differentshipping routes is necessarily a complex matter. As a general rule, most shippingproblems are best settled by direct discussion between, on the one hand, the shipping companies and on the other the shipper (or, in some instances, the Governments)concerned.31. We suggest that Commonwealth Governments should furnish more complete information about the apparently anomalous rates of the kind mentionedin our discussions, and perhaps examples of other difficulties, so that they may be studied by Commonwealth officials in London before the September Conference.32. It was also considered that full use might be made of the CommonwealthShipping Committee, by those Governments which are members of it, for the reviewof shipping problems which affect Commonwealth interests.Protection of intra-Commonwealth trade against injury from unfair tradepractices33. We refer in section VI to the need for international action to remedy themain causes of distortions in international trade in agricultural products. At thesame time we note that the GATT provides that countries may take action againstimports of dumped or subsidised goods where these cause, or threaten to cause,material injury to the trade of another country. Most commonwealth governments already possess the necessary statutory powers to enable them touse this provision in appropriate cases. Those which do not yet possess such powers might consider taking the necessary steps to acquire them.V.-TRADE OF THE COMMONWEALTH WITH THE REST OFTHE WORLD34. In section III we drew attention to the importance of world markets forthe Commonwealth. The concept of the expansion of world trade on a multilateralbasis underlies the whole work of these preparatory discussions. Much of this ground and its wider implications are covered in sections I, II and XIII of our report. In section VI we deal with the role of the GATT in relation to agriculturalprotectionism. In the present section we examine three particularly important aspects of world trade as it affects the Commonwealth. In doing so, however, we
have not ignored the advantages that are to be derived from positive steps whichmight be taken by individual Commonwealth countries to promote their exportsto non-Commonwealth countries. We have already referred in paragraph 22 to thefact that many of the ways of promoting intra-Commonwealth trade which havebeen discussed in section TV can be used also to develop trade with other countries.Trade with the United States35. The economic policies of the United States are of the greatest importance for Commonwealth trade. The United States is the largest market for commonwealth exports and the general level of economic activity in the UnitedStates is very significant because of its direct bearing upon the volume of UnitedStates imports from the Commonwealth and on the volume of international trade generally. It is therefore vital for all of us that the United States Governmentshould be successful in maintaining a high and expanding level of demand. It isalso important that the United States should pursue liberal trade and externalinvestment policies and should continue to recognise the need of under-developed countries for effective support for their economic development. In this connection the levels of the tariffs and other measures affecting imports, the high agriculturalsupports and the stockpile policies of the United States are especially relevant.36. We have noted the firmness with which the United States administration has pursued liberal trade policies. For example, of twenty-nine Tariff Commissionrecommendations for increases in duty on &quot; bound &quot; tariffs since 1948 only tenhave been accepted by the Administration. It has so far fought successfully, witha noteworthy public campaign, to extend the Trade Agreements Act for five years a longer extension than it has ever had; it has recently been seeking ways to avoid giving effect to the Tariff Commission^ recommendations for higher duties orquota restrictions against lead and zinc imports; and it has persuaded congress to accept the Foreign Aid Programme with very little reduction.37. On the other hand. Congress have imposed some limitations on theadoption of liberal tariff policies and the Administration has postponed trying to get Congressional approval of the Organisation for Trade Co-operation whichwas proposed in the Review of the GATT. Furthermore, the administration has recommended subsidies for domestic lead and zinc producers and it seems possible that it will ultimately make some further concessions in the directionof protecting the less efficient lead and zinc producers. Above all, in regard to agricultural protection, with which we deal at length in section VI, theAdministration has in fact followed policies which have limited or shut outcompeting imports from the Commonwealth and have led to the creation ofUnited States surpluses, the disposal of which has caused serious damage to thetrade of other countries.38. One particular aspect of United States policies to which we gave special attention was the disposal of surpluses. This has taken place on a large scalewith considerable effects on the trade and on the balance of payments of commonwealth countries. While we are satisfied that United States policies inthis field have benefited some countries, particularly under-developed countries in balance of payments difficulties, and have sometimes resulted in net increases in consumption which would not otherwise have occurred, we consider that thedisposal of surplus can cause, and indeed has caused, damage to other countriesproducing the commodities in question, including some Commonwealth countries.39. We refer in paragraph 48 below to the need to moderate agriculturalprotectionism, but there can be no assurance that changes will be achieved quickly.Two suggestions were advanced for alleviating the surplus disposals problem inthe meantime.40. In the first place there might be advantage in a further examination of principles. This could take place in the Food and Agriculture Organisation(F.A.O.) and in the GATT. The principles for surplus disposal formulated byF.A.O. are being re-examined in that organisation. It is suggested that commonwealth countries with particular experience in this sphere should give special attention to this re-examination. This should be directed towards improving the code of principles for surplus disposal in the light of the actual experienceof countries supplying, receiving, or affected by, commodity transactions on
non-commercial terms. Furthermore, in the GATT there is a regular review of experience under the existing provisions of the GATT for supplying and receivingcountries to consult other Contracting Parties whose normal trade is likely to beaffected by surplus disposal transactions. This regular review thus presents anopportunity for strengthening the consultative arrangements generally anddiscussing the trade effects of surplus disposals. In this way the GATT can make an important contribution to consolidating and improving the operative principles governing surplus disposals. Full advantage should be taken by commonwealth countries in their discussions before the Thirteenth Session of GATT to considerthe appropriate action in the GATT for achieving these objectives.41. Secondly, we think it desirable that there should be the fullestconsultation possible between Commonwealth countries about individual aidtransactions. Consultations already take place but it is desirable that they shouldbe extended; it is hoped that recipient countries would not leave the responsibilityof consultation to the supplier of aid, but would at the earliest possible stage consultother Commonwealth countries likely to be affected.Trade with Europe42. The problem here is different from that with the United States. TheUnited Kingdom has clearly stated that it is part of its policy in working for a free trade Area so to affect the policies of the Common Market as to make them liberalrather than protectionist in emphasis. Concern is felt by all commonwealth countries lest the Common Market should develop into a strongly protectionistbloc. There is, too, the danger that the negotiations for a Free Trade Area mightthemselves result in other European countries pressing their interests to the point where protectionism spreads more widely.43. In the negotiations for a Free Trade Area the United Kingdom may beable to achieve an arrangement which satisfactorily safeguards its interests inEurope and, indeed, protects trade in many of the commodities produced by commonwealth countries. However, the successful negotiation of a Free trade area would not necessarily moderate the protectionist tendencies of the common market in respect of all important products which the Commonwealth exports to europe. The principal items affected are agricultural products and industrial rawmaterials. It is important that this very significant aspect of the Commonwealth^trade with non-Commonwealth countries should not be neglected.44. In section VI of our report a line of approach is suggested: that GATl&apos;be adjusted to cope more realistically with agricultural protectionism generally,including that of the Common Market.45. The Australian Delegation suggested, as another possible way ofminimising the adverse effects of protectionism, the negotiation of commodity agreements in which European and non-European countries could reconcile their national commodity policies. However, this approach has not been fully debatedand requires&apos; further examination before being considered by Ministers at montreal. But what is clear is the need for watching developments in this importantarea of Commonwealth trade interests. We recommend that Ministers giveconsideration to the most effective means of safeguarding these interests.46. In the meantime, and because of the possible imminence of decisions bythe Common Market, Delegations thought that no opportunity should be lost ofimpressing on the Common Market, through normal diplomatic channels, theserious concern felt by Commonwealth agricultural exporting countries about the potential effects on them of the agricultural policies being formulated under theprovisions of the Rome Treaty.Trade with the Sino-Soviet bloc47. We have given attention to certain special problems which arise in tradewith the Soviet bloc and China. We express the hope that progress is being madein securing a reduced and more realistic list of goods on which strategic controlsshould operate in the light of present conditions. Certain recurrent problems arise in regard to trade and payments with these countries and we think that it wouldbe helpful for Commonwealth Governments to exchange information fairly
continuously on these matters, e.g., through the machinery of the CommonwealthLiaison Committee. The quota and barter system on which these countries base their trade with others cuts across the multilateral trade and payments system whichis the objective of Commonwealth Governments. We hope that trade with theSoviet bloc and with China will expand and that these countries will eventually findways to accommodate their trade system with the multilateral system of the rest ofthe world. Meanwhile, we think that Commonwealth Governments should so faras possible resist any requests from these countries for import quotas which wouldbe unduly favourable having regard to the quotas applied to other commonwealth countries for the same class of goods. A Soviet bloc country might assert thatsuch specially favourable quotas, or some other specially favourable arrangement,is necessary to balance its bilateral trade with a Commonwealth country. In that event, the Commonwealth country could usefully draw attention to the advantage that would accrue to world trade if the Soviet bloc country, or the bloc as a whole,used its transferable sterling to finance multilateral trade as an alternative tobilateral deals. We recognise, however, that some Commonwealth governments may find it necessary to make trade arrangements with the Soviet bloc countries,and with China, on a barter or near-barter basis.VI.-AGRICULTURAL PROTECTIONISM: THE ROLE OF THE GENERALAGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE48. An urgent and serious test facing Governments in international trade is how to limit and reduce the effects of agricultural protectionism.49. The Contracting Parties to the GATT have already recognised that theexisting provisions of the GATT have not proved effective to deal with the impact of agricultural protectionism on international trade and that some revision of the gatt may be necessary. Accordingly they have set up a panel of distinguishedeconomists to report on trends in international trade particularly as regards primary products and the effects of agricultural protectionism. The report of this panel isexpected to be available in September and will be considered by the ContractingParties at their next Session starting in the middle of October.50. The problem of the relations between the European Common market and the rest of the world is particularly acute in the field of agriculture. the member countries of the Common Market rely on import restrictions and state-trading to make effective their protectionist agricultural policies. As theCommon Market develops, the member countries will wish to operate more andmore as a unit in the domain of agriculture as in other economic matters. Thereare strong indications that they will also pursue a protectionist policy under whichthey will permit imports from the rest of the world only to the limited extent thatan expanded agricultural production within the Common Market cannot satisfydemand within its area. This would withdraw an important sector of trade fromthe operation of rules aiming at the expansion of international trade. The problemsposed by. the Common Market are thus closely linked with the problems createdmore generally by agricultural protectionism.51. The emergence of the Common Market has only brought to a head the inadequacy of the GATT, as at present operating, to deal with agriculturalprotectionism. This, for primary producing countries generally, results in a seriousimbalance in the GATT. These countries accord most-favoured-nation (m.f.n.)tariff treatment to the products of industrial countries, which, however, do not always give effective reciprocal m.f.n. treatment to imports of agricultural products.52. The Australian Government has stressed the need for continuous liaison between the GATT and the Common Market and has also put forward tentativeproposals for some formal accommodation, e.g., a contractual relationship betweenthe countries of the Common Market and the other contracting parties to the gatt on the matters in dispute between them. We are agreed that these problems including the Australian proposal and any necessary strengthening ofthe inter-sessional machinery of the GATT require special attention by commonwealth countries over the coming months, and it is proposed that commonwealth Delegations should discuss them together at Montreal and at aspecial pre-GATT Commonwealth meeting in October.
w&apos;&quot; 1353. These problems are of the first importance. We are agreed in recognising the importance of maintaining and strengthening the GATT as the internationalinstitution for dealing with problems of trade on a world-wide basis. Unless itcan deal effectively with these problems, the GATT may cease to enjoy theconfidence of important trading countries and, in consequence, lose its effectiveness.VII. PROBLEMS OF COMMODITY TRADE54. The problems of commodity trade are of great concern and importance for all Commonwealth countries. Indeed, in the view of most Delegations these problems represented one of the most important, if not the most important singleitem to be considered at Montreal. Excessive and sometimes violent fluctuations in the prices of primary products can be to the disadvantage of both producers and consumers and involve serious difficulties for the economies of a number of commonwealth countries. Primary producing countries must achieve a greater measure of predictability in their export incomes if they are to implement stableinternal economic policies. This is especially true of those countries whose exportincome, and hence development, is significantly dependent upon receipts fromprimary products, particularly when only a limited range of such products dominatestheir export trade. There is also a real problem associated with the fall, due to a variety of factors, in the relative share of world trade enjoyed by the non-industrialised countries. The position is reflected in, and accentuated by, the factthat in recent years the rate of economic growth has tended to be faster in highly-industrial countries than in those less developed.55. These difficulties can give rise to serious dangers, political no less thaneconomic. The goals of rising living standards and stable political institutionscannot readily be achieved, except in a context of reasonably steady and predictable,as well as adequate, economic growth. Moreover, political and economicinstability in Commonwealth countries, which are widely distributed geographically,would weaken the forces making for peace and stability in many different parts ofthe world.56. The situation is one which calls for action by Commonwealth and otherGovernments. But it is a complex one. A whole range of problems is involved.Conditions vary from commodity to commodity, as does the impact of the situation on different Commonwealth countries. The association of countries outside theCommonwealth, especially the United States and the major European countries,is essential to a solution in many cases. Thus there can be no one solution: theproblems must be considered under a number of heads.(a) A revival of demand57. The restoration and maintenance of rising demand in the United Statesand other industrial countries is obviously a vital factor which would exercise a beneficial effect on the prospects for many primary products. Indeed rising living standards everywhere and the resultant increases in demand would be important factors in overcoming the problems in commodity trade.(b) Measures to limit agricultural protection58. Most countries in varying degrees support or subsidise their agriculture.But in many countries the high levels of support or subsidisation increasinglydistort the pattern of international trade to the disadvantage of relatively more efficient producers by generating export surpluses (whose disposal is then oftenencouraged by export subsidies, dumping and other special aids) and by restrictingopportunities to sell in Commonwealth markets and elsewhere. Commonwealthexporters are adversely affected both currently and as regards their future prospects. These problems need urgent attention. We think it important that individual Commonwealth countries should review their own policies in this field.But in the case of a great many commodities internationally concerted action to moderate agricultural protectionism is also essential. It is possible that, on some commodities, action confined to Commonwealth countries would be helpful.59. We refer in Section VI to the urgent importance of strengthening the gatt in order to enable it to deal more effectively with these problems.  The
New Zealand Government has suggested that Commonwealth Governments mightmaterially assist by agreeing (i) not to increase existing levels of supports for farm prices and incomes andto reduce these as rapidly as possible to minimum levels consistent with social, strategic and other legitimate requirements;(ii) to accept as an objective that guaranteed or support levels should, overa period, not exceed the general level of prices in international markets and take action as soon as possible to make existing practices conform with this;(iii) to urge in the appropriate international forums the adoption of these principles by other countries.These principles, which are strongly supported by certain Commonwealth countries,present difficulties in some respects for others and will require further study. we agree that Ministers should be invited at the forthcoming Conference to give themost careful attention to the problem of agricultural protectionism with a viewto arriving at a statement of principles and a course of action which would guideCommonwealth countries both in their own national policies and in international discussions.(c) Protection in other fields60. The protection of relatively uneconomic production by high tariffs orother devices can also be an important element in the case of some non-agricultural commodities. An obvious example is the protection of high cost production of minerals and metals by certain European countries and by the United States.The degree to which the United States intends to give further encouragement toher base metals mines should be clearer by the time of the Montreal Conference.An opportunity to bring pressures to bear on these countries should arise in theinternational meetings which are in prospect later this year to consider the problemsof copper, lead and zinc. The protection of jute goods by certain countries is another example in this category.(d) Stockpile and surplus disposal policies61. Changes in the tempo of Government stockpiling, particularly by theUnited States, have had important effects upon the stability of prices and productionof the commodities concerned for some years past. Any new disposals from theUnited States&apos; stockpiles would have great significance for commodity markets.It is clearly most important, especially in present circumstances, that Governmentsholding such stockpiles should, before making disposals from them, consult fully with the Governments of countries which may be affected. Both the United Statesand the United Kingdom Governments have recognised the importance of this,but the current situations in the commodities concerned are such that it is of theutmost importance that consultations concerning any proposed disposals be close and continuous.62. The problem of the disposal of surplus agricultural products (e.g. cotton)is primarily one stemming from United States policies. It is for consideration whether-it would be wise or appropriate for Commonwealth Governments to supplement their individual representations by some special joint approach to theUnited States Government on a suitable occasion concerning its disposal policies in respect of some commodities, especially cotton. But the timing and form of anysuch approach, if this were thought desirable, would need careful consideration.(e) Stabilisation measures63. Some countries have useful internal stabilisation schemes. But these have their limitations. Stabilisation schemes on an international basis can only beconsidered commodity by commodity. Some commodities may not readily lendthemselves to such schemes. In the case of others the formulation of schemes may appear to be a difficult undertaking, but this is no excuse for refraining fromdetermined attempts to achieve schemes where the basic conditions are appropriate. For the most part action must be taken on a wide internationalbasis: in respect of the majority of commodities the participation of the UnitedStates and the major European countries will be necessary to be fully effective. Inthe absence of the co-operation of these countries, Commonwealth arrangements should not be ruled out.
64. An important objective is to avoid excessive short-term fluctuations inprices and any attempt to achieve this without regard to long-term market trendsis likely to fail, especially having regard to the great advances since the war in thedevelopment of substitutes for many products.Review of commodities65. Against the background of this analysis we have made a review of theprincipal commodities of importance for Commonwealth countries. The summaryof this review, set out in Appendix D, shows that the following are the cases whereconcerted international action is of particular concern to the Commonwealth:  (i) Existing commodity arrangements. Schemes for sugar, wheat and tinalready exist, while one for olive oil is about to start. It is most desirable that such schemes should be continued and broadenedwherever possible e.g., by accession of new countries as membersof the International Sugar Agreement. The International wheat agreement will be coming up for renewal next year. The UnitedKingdom Government will be taking part in the discussions and itcontinues to be the hope of the Australian and Canadian governments that the United Kingdom Government will find it possible to rejoin thescheme.(ii) Possible new commodity arrangements. The principal commoditiesunder this head are rubber, copper, lead and zinc. The problem onrubber is a difficult one given the relationship with synthetic rubber,the essential need for participation by the United States, and thedifficulty of effective participation by Indonesia. The InternationalRubber Study Group has studied the problem in the past and certain proposals are again under current examination. There would be great advantages for Malaya and Ceylon if an effective scheme could beevolved. International meetings are planned for later this year toconsider the problems of copper, lead and zinc. It is desirable that allinterested Commonwealth Governments should be ready to participateactively in these discussions, and to examine objectively the problemsof, and prospects for, stabilisation arrangements in these commodities.Whilst these should clearly be sought on a wide international basis, ifthis cannot be achieved the possibility of action confined to theCommonwealth should be examined. In the case of rubber and non-ferrous metals the future of United States stockpiling and the use ofexisting stockpiles is a matter of great importance and relevance. Itwas noted that discussions between producing countries were about totake place in the case of tea and the possibility of later considerationof the need for international action has been recognised with respect tocoffee and cocoa.(iii) Other international action. It was agreed that in the case of meat, dairyproduce, wheat and coarse grains the need is for effective national and international action to deal with the difficulties created by policies ofagricultural protection. Commonwealth Governments should beprepared to give a lead in securing effective international discussionof these problems.Possible approach to the United States Government66. The discussions showed that at some time and in some agreed way itwould probably be desirable for Commonwealth countries, either collectively orindividually, to secure the co-operation of the United States Government in a freshapproach to this whole range of problems not only in regard to commodityschemes as such but also in respect of agricultural protectionism and of surplusdisposal and stockpiling policies.Action in the period before the Montreal Conference67. This whole range of commodity problems will be before Ministers in montreal. It was however agreed that this fact should not preclude action beforeMontreal if appropriate cases came up. It was also agreed that it might be desirableto arrange for further and fuller discussions at the official level about certain
VIII.-FINANCE AND DEVELOPMENT68. We have studied the problems of finance and development in the light ofour general objective: namely, the need to ensure the steady expansion of tradeand development within the Commonwealth as part of an expanding world economy. In order to attain this objective there is a consequent need for all commonwealth countries to encourage more savings, to attract more outsidecapital, and to conduct their domestic policies in a manner which will contribute to the soundness of sterling and their own currencies. There is also need to ensurethat international economic institutions continue to play an increasingly importantrole.United States recession69. We have considered the future course of the United States recession inview of the fundamental implications which it has for these sections of our work.The recession has gone deeper than other post-war recessions in the United States.Despite this, however, there has been a continuing outflow of gold and dollars fromthe United States to the outside world on a substantial scale. This is of greatimportance from the point of view of world liquidity. There is obvious room fordifferences of views about the precise course of United States activity over thecoming months. But we are all agreed that the United States does not appear tobe on the threshold of a rapid recovery which would have the effect, in the nearfuture, of bringing levels of output up to the peaks attained in mid-1957. Someof us indeed feel that no marked recovery will take place during the current year,and are apprehensive lest this position may continue into 1959.70. The need for us to bring our assessment up to date, in the light of developments before September, is thus re-emphasised.IX.-STERLING AREA PROSPECTS71. The picture for 1958 put forward by the meeting of Commonwealthstatisticians held in May, 1958, was as follows:  (a) The sterling area as a whole might prove to be roughly in balance on external account with the rest of the world. The two main elements inthis likely overall result were, first, that the United Kingdom would havea large balance of payments surplus on current account; and, second,that&apos; overall other members would have a very large deficit on current account (involving heavy drafts on their reserves) which would, in aggregate, be greater than the surplus of the United Kingdom.The position of approximate balance, however, postulated (i) a reduction of imports by certain countries through monetary andother means; and(ii) an increasing inflow of capital on public and private account.(b) The reserves of the sterling area countries other than the United Kingdomtaken as a whole might begin to fall less rapidly in the second half of1958 than in the first half, with the result that their reserves should begin to stabilise towards the end of the year.72. We have further reviewed the position and prospects of each countryindividually. It is clear that the balance of payments deficits of many countries will in fact be larger than those set out above, with the result that there will be greater stringency of reserves and therefore greater danger of further traderestriction. Apart from any consequential impact of this on the United Kingdom,the United Kingdom assessment of its own economic prospects was confirmed.individual commodities (not confined to those mentioned in Appendix D, butincluding, e.g., iron and manganese ores) in the period before the MontrealConference.   The United Kingdom representatives undertook to be responsible   ffor arranging such discussions if these proved desirable.
X.-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT77. Our discussions have emphasised that economic development is centralnot merely to the economic progress of the Commonwealth but also to the whole structure of Commonwealth relationships and the maintenance of free institutions.The problem is one of great size and urgency and occupied a major place in our deliberations.78. The past decade has witnessed far-reaching changes in the less developed countries. The achievement of independence for many of these countries and thewidespread political awakening in under-developed areas generally has intensifiedthe demand for economic and social advancement. This has been reflected in the wider adoption and execution of development plans. While these countries havemade a considerable effort to mobilise internal resources, the compulsion for development has been such that in most cases their development plans have gonebeyond the limits imposed by the resources locally available. The difference hasbeen partly made up by external capital. The United Kingdom and the UnitedStates have played the major role in providing this: more recently the Soviet Unionhas begun to play an increasing part. Much capital has also been provided by international institutions or under international auspices. In a number of cases there has also been a running down of foreign exchange reserves. Nevertheless, thetotality of resources available has not matched requirements and in some cases thishas necessitated a curtailment of development plans. Difficulties have been aggravated, in the past year or so, by reductions in export earnings of some less developed countries brought about by falling commodity prices.79. It has been recognised that, as far as possible, the financial requirements for development have to be met from domestic savings within individual countries.It is, therefore, essential that domestic policies should encourage the growth of suchsavings. All the developing Commonwealth countries must, however, in varying degrees, also seek to attract capital from abroad if they are to maintain the rate ofdevelopment at an acceptable pace. Those with low incomes and limited savings73. In reaching these conclusions the sterling area countries have basedthemselves upon the following assumptions:  (a) No marked increase in industrial activity in areas outside the Communistbloc is likely during the remainder of 1958.(b) There is no early prospect of any appreciable rise in commodity prices.74. In these circumstances we doubt whether the pressure on the reserves of sterling area countries is likely to be nearing its end during this year. If this is so, the dangers of further restrictions on trade for balance of payments reasons arelikely to increase and persist into 1959. It is in this that we see the threat ofcumulative contraction of Commonwealth and world trade and economic activity.75.  We submit the following conclusions: (i) It is of the highest importance to the prosperity of the Commonwealththat the main industrial countries should resume steady economic growthas soon as possible. Such countries are better able to do this if they arein a strong external financial position.In this context, we took note that it is the policy of the UnitedKingdom Government to resume a policy of moderate and sustainableexpansion as soon as it is possible safely to do so.(ii) Any intensification of restrictions on trade or payments should be avoidedif at all possible, since the trend towards freer trade and payments, ifinterrupted, might be difficult to resume.(iii) The flow of capital into the sterling area should be maintained and ifpossible increased.76. Arrangements are being made for officials to bring the assessment of sterling area balance of payments prospects up to date before the MontrealConference.
are in most need of this source of finance: for they cannot hope to maintain from internal sources alone that pace of development which is needed for the survival of free institutions.80. But there is a world shortage of capital. This is due partly to the rapidtechnological changes of the past decade in the more industrialised countries; these changes have led to an intense demand for capital within their own borders.Further, in a number of other Commonwealth countries where national incomes are relatively high, developments are also proceeding which require external capital.In these circumstances of competition for capital there is a tendency for externalcapital to be concentrated in an unusual degree on projects offering an attractiverate of return. While such capital imports release local resources for social andgeneral development, thus making balanced development possible, they tend toflow to those countries where opportunities for profitable investment are greatest,and these may not be the countries which have the greatest need.81. The continuing challenge is to find the means by which internal savingsmay be mobilised for development and external capital attracted from new orexisting sources and from institutions inside and outside the Commonwealth. an allied question is whether a deliberate effort should be made to achieve anyredistribution of the existing flow of capital. These are matters of the deepestconcern, not only to those Commonwealth countries where standards of living arelow, and the need for development paramount, but to all Commonwealth countriesincluding those in more fortunate circumstances. This concern has been reflected in bilateral aid arrangements within the Commonwealth including those made underthe Colombo Plan which has played an important role in commonwealth development. The Colombo Plan has made available to the less developed member countries both capital and technical assistance to a growing degree. international institutions, especially the I.B.R.D. (discussed in paragraphs 97-99 below), have alsoplayed an increasing part over the past decade in the field of development. Inaddition, mention should be made of United Nations initiatives which have recentlyled to the creation of the Special Projects Fund and the proposals for theestablishment of the Special United Nations Fund for Economic Development.Steps to Attract Capital82. The policies of Governments are of importance in creating a favourableclimate for overseas capital. The essential point is whether such an inflow is reallywelcome, and is made to feel welcome, or whether it is regarded with suspicion.The general soundness and record of the economic policies being pursued by countries wishing to attract capital is a fundamental factor. Specific factors suchas domestic legislation in the fields of taxation and exchange control and the mannerin which such legislation is administered are also important.83. Attempts have been made in the past to codify good debtor behaviour but these have encountered difficulties. While these possibilities are being further examined in various quarters, it is questionable how far a code of this kind wouldinfluence potential investors. In the last analysis, it is actions rather than words which are important.The Scope for New Commonwealth Institutions(a) A Commonwealth Bank84. We have considered whether the supply of capital for commonwealth development could be improved by the setting up of new institutions or the mergingof existing institutions. In particular we have examined a proposal for a commonwealth Bank or Development Agency, the main features of which couldbe as follows:  (i) Membership would be open to all Commonwealth Governments.  each member would subscribe to the capital of the Bank in proportions to beagreed and would in addition undertake a liability in respect of theuncalled capital. The paid-up capital would provide assets which theBank could lend or against which the Bank could borrow.(ii) Subscriptions would be payable in gold, dollars or sterling.  In certain cases, dollar or sterling securities might be accepted.
(iii) The Bank would seek to borrow in New York and in other capital marketsoutside the Commonwealth. It might also borrow in London subject tothe normal control exercised over access to the market. It might alsoseek to raise loans in Commonwealth countries in order to cover thelocal currency needs of particular projects. Finally, it might in certain cases guarantee loans raised by individual countries.85.  The main objects of such a Bank would be:  (i) To mobilise and increase the volume of capital, whether from official or private sources, both from inside and outside the Commonwealth.(ii) In particular, to enable those countries of the Commonwealth who areunable to borrow on their own credit in foreign capital markets toobtain indirect access to funds from those sources. The essence of theproposal is that Commonwealth Governments might be able to raise a larger amount of capital by pooling their credit than they could by continuing to borrow individually. Even if they could not do this, theresult of such collective borrowing might be to effect some redistributionin favour of the countries less able to borrow on their own credit perhapsat the expense of the stronger.86. We have considered what effects such an institution would have on the mobilisation of savings both inside and outside the Commonwealth, and on theattitude of international institutions.87. As regards the mobilisation of additional resources within theCommonwealth, the United Kingdom is the only Commonwealth country which isa net long-term exporter of capital. The total volume of United Kingdom overseas investment is already high and it would be unwise to assume that it could be significantly increased. We have considered whether a portion of the sterling balances of Commonwealth countries which are held, to a large extent, in liquidform, could in some way be used to enable a Commonwealth Bank to undertakelong-term lending operations. Such an operation, however, would not in itselfcreate additional savings and any increased capital outflow from the UnitedKingdom which resulted would, therefore, add to the strain on United Kingdomresources.88. The principal sources outside the Commonwealth from which a commonwealth Bank could hope to raise capital would be the New York market and, to a lesser extent, Continental European markets. At present the funds available in Continental European money markets for lending to a commonwealth Bank are likely to be limited. Some doubts have been expressedwhether a Commonwealth Bank would be able to borrow appreciable sums on theNew York market at favourable rates of interest. It is, of course, the case that, inaddition to the value that the New York market would attach to the guarantees of Commonwealth Governments, any dollar assets held by the institution couldserve as additional collateral for borrowing.89. A question of very great importance is whether the establishment of a commonwealth Bank would increase or decrease the financial resources whichthe I.B.R.D. is likely to make available to Commonwealth countries. On the onehand, the views of the I.B.R.D. are that it has so far been able to finance all soundprojects which can be financed on a repayable loan basis within the limits imposed by a country&apos;s credit-worthiness; that it has had, as yet, no occasion to refuse a loan to a Commonwealth country on the grounds that finance is not available;and that to the extent that finance becomes available from other sources e.g., froma Commonwealth Bank it might possibly feel obliged to reduce its owncontribution so as to keep the total below the credit-worthiness ceiling. Thepossibility must also be faced that the I.B.R.D. might expect commonwealth countries to turn first to their own financial institution before coming to the I.B.R.D.On the other hand, the I.B.R.D. does operate jointly with other outside lendinginstitutions in financing particular development projects. There might well bepossibilities in a Commonwealth Bank undertaking schemes jointly with theI.B.R.D. in this way, provided that the Commonwealth Bank was conducted on a sound commercial basis. Moreover, some doubt has been felt regarding the validity of the I.B.R.D.&apos;s view that it has always so far been able to finance all soundprojects within a country&apos;s credit-worthiness ceiling; there are grounds for believing that the I.B.R.D., for reasons of banking prudence, tends to spread its
operations over its member countries and in some cases has for other reasons limited the amount which it was prepared to lend. Some Delegations expressed the viewthat the totality of loans made to members by the I.B.R.D. is sometimes less thanthe limit of the I.B.R.D.&apos;s own assessment of their credit-worthiness; a commonwealth Bank might help to bridge this gap.90. There might be scope for a Commonwealth Bank to raise loans in commonwealth countries with the approval of the domestic government concerned.91. A view was expressed that a Commonwealth inter-Governmentalinstitution, confronted by requests for loans exceeding in total the funds available,would be faced with embarrassing problems of allocation.(b) The Commonwealth Development Finance Company (C.D.F.C.)92. It was noted that the C.D.F.C. had hitherto only been able to operate on a limited scale and that this was due, in part at least, to the difficulty in recentperiods of raising further capital at rates of interest which would be appropriate to development finance. We have considered the possibility of commonwealth governments or Central Banks subscribing additional capital to the C.D.F.C.This is a private body and any such proposal would of course have to be discussed with and agreed to by the management. Difficulties might arise if a substantial proportion of its capital came from public funds. On the other hand, the injectionof further official funds might stimulate increased participation by private interests.93. In some cases existing legislation would prevent Commonwealth central banks from acquiring an equity risk in a private concern. The Delegation of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland indicated that the Central Bank of theFederation would be able to make a small subscription to the C.D.F.C.: other delegations undertook to invite their Governments to look into the question.(c) Merging the C.D.F.C. and the Colonial Development Corporation (C.D.C.)94. It was suggested to us that the activities of the C.D.F.C. and the C.D.C.might be merged. Such a suggestion is however impracticable since the C.D.F.C.is a private Company whereas the C.D.C. derives its funds primarily from official sources, the responsible Minister is accountable to Parliament for the generaloperations of the C.D.C. as a United Kingdom public corporation, and theCorporation was intended as one of the instruments through which the UnitedKingdom Government discharges the special responsibilities it has for its dependent territories. The Corporation is however enabled to perform managing agency and advisory services in any Commonwealth country, at the request of theGovernment of that country, on a repayment basis.(d) A United Kingdom Export-Import Bank95. The suggestion was made that the United Kingdom might set up an export-Import Bank on the lines of the United States Bank. Powers already existunder the Export Guarantees Acts, 1949 and 1957, which enable the UnitedKingdom to extend credits for the purchase of United Kingdom exports of goods and services; the period of repayment of such credits is not limited by statute. Itwas felt moreover, that the setting up of a permanent institution of this kind withfixed powers for borrowing and lending was more appropriate to a country in astrong creditor position such as the United States. The United Kingdom needs to be in a position to pursue a more flexible policy than the United States in theamount which it can lend at any time.The Increased Use of Existing Institutions96. Having considered the possibility of setting up new institutions to mobilise capital, we examined how far existing institutions could play an increasedpart in Commonwealth development.(a) The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development97. The I.B.R.D. has played a vital and increasing role, in recent years, in providing long-term capital for Commonwealth development. Approximately$1,200 millions, or close to one-third of total I.B.R.D. lending since the beginningof its operations, has been made available to the following Commonwealth
countries: Australia, Ceylon, India, Pakistan, South Africa, the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, the East Africa High Commission and the Federationof Nigeria. It is understood that further loans to some of these and at least one other Commonwealth country are under active consideration. Although someI.B.R.D. lending has been in the form of sterling, the bulk of the loans granted havebeen United States dollar loans. Thus, the I.B.R.D. has been the largest singlesource of United States dollars for development projects available to commonwealth countries.98. In addition to its financial resources, the I.B.R.D. has placed at thedisposal of less-developed countries a fund of knowledge and expertise in the field of development and has provided advice and assistance in the actual planning ofdevelopment operations.99. The I.B.R.D&apos;s capital structure is such that, if its current rate of lendingis maintained or increased, its ability to raise funds in two or three years&apos; time willbecome seriously impaired. We agree that a strengthening of the ability of theI.B.R.D. to borrow provides the best assurance for an increased flow of officialcapital to the less-developed areas. Our views on how this may best be done areto be found in paragraphs 112-113 below.(b) United Kingdom Export Credits100. We considered whether the periods for which Governments are preparedto insure suppliers&apos; credits could be extended. Those of us whose Governmentsinsure such credits thought that this would be an inappropriate means of providingwhat would, in effect, be long-term capital with a Government guarantee. However,the United Kingdom Government have stated that if there were a continued declinein the level of world trade, they might be ready to consider using the powers which existed under Sections 2 and 3 of the Export Guarantees Acts, 1949 and 1957,outside the normal insurance scheme, for economic assistance to the commonwealth and other overseas countries, and to maintain export activity in the UnitedKingdom. This might involve the provision of guarantees or finance over longerperiods than at present. The main purpose of such assistance would be to assistprimary producing countries in meeting short-term balance of payments difficulties.The United Kingdom Delegation took note, however, of the suggestion that such powers might also be used to provide longer-term development finance.Technical Assistance101. The chief sources of technical assistance, which is so vital for economic development, are the Technical Co-operation Scheme of the Colombo Plan, UnitedStates technical assistance programmes, the Expanded Technical AssistanceProgramme of the United Nations, the programmes of the Specialised agencies and the arrangements made by the Colonial Office in respect of the dependent territories of the United Kingdom. Technical assistance is also afforded throughbilateral and other capital aid projects. There are the mutual technical assistancearrangements between the United Kingdom and Ghana, and the Foundation for mutual Assistance in Africa South of the Sahara. Canada is giving technical assistance to Ghana and the West Indian Federation, and Australia to Ghana.102. Our discussion of the useful role played by technical assistance, in itsmany and varied forms, brought forward a number of suggestions for the attentionof those responsible for technical assistance programmes in both sending and receiving countries. In general, the sending countries reported that their difficulty was not so much to find the money, but to find the right men and women; it wasa human rather than a financial problem. This emphasised the need for imaginationand flexibility both in attempting to locate people to serve and also in offering themconditions of service that would be attractive. At the other end, the receivingcountries were agreed that they should exercise their best endeavours to make gooduse of any services supplied. In this connection, the Indian representative saidthat his Government had established machinery to co-ordinate all the varioustechnical assistance schemes, bilateral and multilateral, at work in his country; this machinery had eliminated a good deal of duplication and waste of effort. certain other Governments have similar machinery. It was also generally agreed amongstthe receiving countries that they placed particular value on the services of personswho were willing to come and work &quot; on the ground,&quot; in a practical way, teachingby personal example.
Summary105. The problem of finding adequate resources to meet the needs of the under-developed countries of the Commonwealth is central both to the economic progress of the Commonwealth and to the maintenance of our free institutions.Its size and urgency have given it a major place in our deliberations. There is however a world shortage of capital relative to demand. The more industrialised countries are passing through a period of rapid technological change and some ofthe countries in the Commonwealth with relatively high levels of national incomealso have pressing needs for capital.106. Countries seeking external capital for development must create and maintain a favourable climate for it. Domestic savings however form an important,and in most cases the principal, source of development capital. Neither of theseforms of capital will be forthcoming unless sound economic policies are followed.107.   Our main conclusions are (i) There are advantages in the establishment of a Commonwealth Bank, butthere are also difficulties. Ministers may wish to review this matter inthe widest Commonwealth context (paragraphs 84-90).(ii) The possibility  of expanding  the resources of the  C.D.F.C.  by contributions from Commonwealth Governments or Central Banksmight be looked into further in consultation with the company, to whomthe outcome of our deliberations on this subject should now becommunicated with a view to ascertaining, before the MontrealConference, whether any further action can be taken (paragraph 92).(iii) There is a strong case for increasing the resources of the I.B.R.D. whichhas made a very important and increasingly valuable contribution to commonwealth development. A strengthening of the I.B.R.D. appearsto be the most promising step which could be taken in the field ofdevelopment (paragraphs 97-99). Our specific ideas on how this objective might be achieved are set out in paragraphs 112-113.(iv) The United Kingdom has stated that it is ready to consider in certaincircumstances making greater use of the facilities available under sections 2 and 3 of the Export Guarantees Acts, 1949 and 1957, and took note of the suggestion that such powers might be used to providelonger term finance (paragraph 100).(v) Within the Commonwealth, bilateral aid arrangements, including those under the Colombo Plan, have made, and are making, importantcontributions to Commonwealth development. These arrangementscover both capital and technical assistance. Ministers may wish toconsider the enlargement of capital assistance (paragraph 81) and the specific suggestions relating to technical assistance (paragraph 102).Other Matters(a) Double Taxation103. It was suggested that in certain cases the provisions for double taxationTelief were defective, in that they frustrated the operation of pioneer industry andother tax concessions granted by some Commonwealth Governments. So far asUnited Kingdom legislation is concerned, it was also suggested that the provisions for relief in favour of overseas trading corporations might be widened since in theirpresent form they militate against the establishment of local subsidiary companies.These proposals, however, involve difficult technical issues. They would require an amendment of United Kingdom legislation and the United Kingdom Delegationundertook to bring this matter to the notice of H.M. Ministers.(b) Building Societies104. It has been suggested that the United Kingdom Building Societies shouldbe permitted, and perhaps encouraged, to invest some part of their funds in theCommonwealth, as mortgages on housing there. This proposal would involve an amendment of United Kingdom legislation (The Building Societies Act, 1874).
XI.-LIQUIDITY AND INTERNATIONAL INSTITUTIONS   :108. The I.B.R.D. and the I.M.F. have played a great part in the growth ofthe world economy respectively by-(i) channelling investment funds from the more highly developed countries to the less developed countries;(ii). making assistance available to countries facing short-term balance ofpayments difficulties.109. These two institutions must continue to play a major role in theexpansion of world trade and development (the role of the I.B.R.D. has beendiscussed in paragraphs 97-99 above): steps must therefore be taken as a matterof urgency to increase their resources. We hope that at the next annual Bank-Fund meetings positive recommendations will be made to this end.110. United Kingdom and Canadian officials have each recently heldinformal discussions with members of the United States Administration on thismatter. While United States officials are not unfavourably disposed to actionon these lines and although certain references have recently been made to theproblem by public figures in the United States, the Administration has as yettaken no decision. United States officials have emphasised that serious difficulties would be caused for their Government if it appeared that they were being brought under concerted international pressure on this matter.111. In the light of these general considerations we make the followingspecific proposals.International Bank for Reconstruction and Development112. The scale of the I.B.R.D&apos;s operations will inevitably have to be reduced in the not too distant future, unless some action is taken to increase its ability to borrow. This depends primarily on the uncalled 80 per cent, subscriptions ofthe member countries and, in particular, of the United States. The I.B.R.D&apos;sborrowings are now mounting towards this ceiling and, as pointed out inparagraph 99, unless this is raised the I.B.R.D&apos;s ability to raise funds will before long be impaired. The crucial factor is therefore to secure an early increasein the United States uncalled subscription; it is unlikely that this could be achieved without a general increase in uncalled subscriptions.113.   Our conclusions are (i) There should be an all-round increase in the 80 per cent, uncalledsubscriptions of all members of the I.B.R.D.: this has the advantageof not involving any immediate capital payment on the part of member countries.(ii) It was the general view that the importance of securing this increase is such that, if it were necessary, member countries should be preparedto consider a further increase in their gold subscriptions and in therelease of their own currencies. Member Governments should consider this matter further before September.International Monetary Fund114. There is a strong case for extending the resources of the I.M.F. CertainDelegations have made the point that the quotas which were fixed at the originaldiscussions leading up to the establishment of the I.M.F. were in their view too low. The value of world trade has subsequently increased greatly. We have nodoubt that the resources of I.M.F. are without question now inadequate.,115.  Our conclusions are (i) There should be an overall increase in the quotas of all member countries of the I.M.F.(ii) Payments in gold of 25 per cent, of any quota increase would raisedifficulties for many Commonwealth countries, some of whom expressedthe view that means should be sought of relieving them of this obligation.
(iii) There is a case for adjusting individual quotas which are out of line. Wecannot say whether it will be more advantageous to tackle this question at the same time as the question of a general increase in quotas. Thiswill need &quot;further consideration but our major aim should be to avoid any delay in the achievement of the main objective set out in (i) above.116. The Delegation of the Federation of Malaya said that they had no specific instructions from their Ministers on this subject and therefore reservedtheir position in this matter.Sterling Drawings from the I.M.F.117. The United Kingdom Delegation reported that the United KingdomGovernment would now look with favour on drawings of sterling from the I.M.F.by sterling area or non-sterling area countries. No public announcement to this effect is likely to be made before the next annual Bank-Fund meeting; but if casesarise in the interim they will be considered in the light of the United Kingdom&apos;snew policy in this regard.XII.-COMMONWEALTH CONSULTATION118. To be effective, Commonwealth consultation must not only provideopportunity for the exchange of information and views : members should also havea full understanding of the thinking underlying each others policies if they are togive each other efficient mutual support. The Delegation of the Federation of malaya have stressed that the arrangements for consultation should give all members opportunity to express their views on important topics.Existing Arrangements119. The existing arrangements for consultation between commonwealth governments on economic matters are described in Appendix E. Briefly, they include: diplomatic channels; the Commonwealth Liaison Committee; meetingsof the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations with High commissioners in London; personal messages between Ministers; conferences, Ministerial and official; specialised organisations; and the Commonwealth Economic Committee.The general experience of Commonwealth Governments is that this machinery forthe exchange of information and views is well fitted for its purposes and workssatisfactorily. What is important is that it should be fully used. There would bevalue in including in the communique of the Montreal Conference reference to theexistence of this machinery, as many aspects of it are not widely known and, taken as a whole, it is impressive.320. Personal contact between Ministers, and between senior officialsresponsible for advising on policy, provides the most effective consultation inmatters of importance. Finance Ministers already have the opportunity for suchcontact each year at the time of the Bank-Fund meetings. Ministers have also theopportunity for discussion of economic matters at Commonwealth Prime Ministers&apos;Meetings, at such special conferences as the Montreal Conference, and on visitsbetween capitals.Meetings of Senior Officials121. In recent years senior officials from all Commonwealth countries have met together more frequently. These meetings have been found to be of great value and might be put on a more regular footing, despite the inevitable difficulty whichsenior officials have in leaving their headquarters for the time required. ministers may conclude that senior officials should meet normally once ayear. There would beample material to make an annual meeting valuable and, if it were public knowledge that such meetings would be held fairly regularly, the risk of their giving rise tospeculation could be discounted. At the same time flexibility is desirable. Meetingsmight sometimes be arranged in connection with other meetings, for example thoseof Commonwealth Prime Ministers. But in years in which this is not convenient,senior officials might normally meet in the first half of the calendar year, in orderthat their meetings should fall about mid-way between the annual meetings of commonwealth Finance Ministers which are held at the time of the Bank-Fund
Meetings in the autumn. Such meetings of senior officials could be used to initiatepreparatory work for the meetings of Finance Meetings. They might be held indifferent Commonwealth capitals as convenient. Appropriate arrangements couldbe made as occasion demanded for the interests of the Colonies to be represented.A Consultative Council or Organisation122. One possibility which may have presentational advantage would be togive a name to the structure of meetings of Commonwealth Finance Ministers, andof senior officials, the Commonwealth Liaison Committee and the commonwealth economic Committee. The &quot; Commonwealth Economic Consultative Council&quot;has been suggested. Other alternatives put forward were &quot; Commonwealth Tradeand Economic Council,&quot; &quot; Commonwealth Economic Consultative Organisation &quot;and &quot; Commonwealth Organisation for Trade and Economic Consultation.&quot;123. The South African Delegation, however, have taken the view that thepresent arrangements, under which senior officials have meetings when necessary,are adequate and that no change in these arrangements is desirable.The Commonwealth Liaison Committee124. The Commonwealth Liaison Committee provides a useful forum for afrequent exchange of information and views. The value of discussion in that committee depends on the experience of the members: the Committee&apos;s usefulnessmight be further enhanced if a conscious effort were made to maintainrepresentation at as high a level as possible.125. Hitherto its meetings have been largely confined to the exchange ofinformation. It may be that more substantial discussion would be possible ifspecial meetings were arranged sufficiently in advance for members to get directionsfrom their Governments.A Commonwealth Economic Secretariat126. We have considered a suggestion that Commonwealth governments should go further and establish a Commonwealth Economic Secretariat in Londonwhich would prepare for meetings of Commonwealth Ministers and officials oneconomic matters, keep current economic developments under review, particularly those liable to affect the strength of sterling, and send regular reports to commonwealth Governments. Our general feeling is that such a step would not be advisable at present. Such an organisation would make additional demands onskilled man-power which is in short supply. We do not think it should be givenexecutive functions. Nor do we think it should replace the existing direct channelsfor consultation between Commonwealth Governments, and it might therefore have little work to do. However, from time to time, it might be appropriate forthe Commonwealth Economic Committee to be asked to arrange for the preparationof special reports for use at Commonwealth meetings.The Commonwealth Economic Committee127. The Commonwealth Economic Committee is considering the possibilityof expanding its scope and functions as a result of an invitation extended to it bythe Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in 1957. We were informed bySir Gilbert Rennie, the Chairman of the Committee, that its recommendations to commonwealth Governments will be contained in two reports dealing respectivelywith the improvement and expansion of its existing work and with an extension ofthe Committee&apos;s activities into new economic fields, and that it is hoped that bothreports will be available at the time of the Montreal Conference.XIII.-EUROPEAN  ECONOMIC  COMMUNITY  AND  european free TRADE AREA128. Our consideration of this question was handicapped by the fact that, atthe time of our meeting, the negotiations in Europe had been suspended in con-sequence of the French crisis, and the conditions in which they might be resumedwere uncertain.   But we had several discussions on various aspects of the problem.
129. We were given by the United Kingdom Delegation a very full accountof the development of the negotiations for a Free Trade Area in Europe and of theposition reached at the time of our meeting. It remains our belief that the achieve-ment of an outward looking Free Trade Area on the lines proposed by the UnitedKingdom is of high importance, both politically and economically. We have notedthe particular difficulties with which the United Kingdom is faced, especially those relating to problems of origin and to the treatment of agriculture. Some of us have felt concerned lest the United Kingdom, under pressure of negotiation, should be driven to make concessions on these matters which would be damaging to widertrading relationships and to Commonwealth interests. In particular, there was some anxiety lest, in the matter of agriculture, the Free Trade Area should add tothe damage to international trading relationships which was feared from theEuropean Economic Community; and lest the draft Agreement on agriculture ahould open the way to a wider number of European countries being associatedwith the European Economic Community in discriminatory commodity arrange-ments which might be objectionable. The United Kingdom Delegation pointedout that they could not safeguard the interests of other Commonwealth countries inthe markets of European countries. But they reassured us that no departure inthe declared United Kingdom policy was in contemplation. They renewed their undertaking that full consultation with the rest of the Commonwealth would continue and that thus, if any changes of policy were to be examined, account wouldbe taken of Commonwealth views.130. Some Delegations expressed their concern that in the course of thenegotiations decisions should be taken or prejudged which would affect the interestsof their countries without their being able to exert their influence in good time.They wished to find a way by which Commonwealth countries could be associatedmore directly with the European countries in the negotiations in order to ensurean earlier mutual understanding on the problems which were arising. The UnitedKingdom Delegation did not think that this suggestion would be acceptable tothe European countries and considered that it might hinder rather than advance the negotiations; but they undertook to bear in mind the desire for closer Common-wealth contact with the negotiations and to take advantage of any opportunity which might present itself for making an advance on these lines. In the meantime,the United Kingdom would continue to keep the Commonwealth fully informed of the progress of the negotiations.
Appendix AMEETING   OF   COMMONWEALTH   FINANCE   MINISTERS,SEPTEMBER-OCTOBER,   1957-COMMUNIQUEThe meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers at Mont Tremblant endedto-day. The Ministers welcomed the presence for the first time of two new members, the Finance Ministers of Ghana and the Federation of Malaya. the meetings were held in an atmosphere of cordiality and understanding. Thefollowing are the agreed conclusions on the three questions that were discussed:  1. The Pound SterlingA strong pound sterling is vital to the stability and economic progress not only of the sterling area and its individual members but also of the world tradingcommunity as a whole. At this meeting the Ministers warmly supported recentstatements on sterling made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in London and washington and recognised that its strength depends upon the joint and individualpolicies of the members of the sterling area. Essentially this involves each member-country living within its available resources. This does not and should not imply a static policy, for the resources of each country can be augmented by suitablepolicies directed towards strengthening its competitive position, increasing itssavings and promoting freer and expanding trade and payments and a larger flow of international capital.2. European Economic IntegrationThe Ministers reviewed the progress made towards the ratification of the Treatyof Rome establishing the European Economic Community and the effect of this treaty on the interests of the Commonwealth. They noted that the treaty would receive further consideration in international organisations.United Kingdom Ministers reported on the progress made following the UnitedKingdom initiative for the establishment of a Free Trade Area in Europe. TheCommonwealth Ministers recognise that the establishment of an outward-lookingFree Trade Area in Europe would broaden the advantages to be derived fromeconomic integration in Europe not only by the United Kingdom but by all theother participants. This was regarded as important as it could contribute to agreedCommonwealth policies of expanding world trade.It was also agreed that there is need for effective machinery for continuousconsultation among Commonwealth countries on matters related to the european economic Community and the proposed Free Trade Area.United Kingdom Ministers reaffirmed the undertakings previously given bytheir Government about the safeguarding of Commonwealth interests in the UnitedKingdom market for foodstuffs including drink and tobacco.3. Commonwealth Trade and Economic conference the Ministers approved the proposal of the Canadian Government thata Commonwealth Trade and Economic Conference should be held at a convenientplace and time in 1958 and agreed to recommend this proposal to their governments. The changing pattern in trade production and developmentthroughout the world presents all Commonwealth countries with new problems and new opportunities. They considered that the time is most opportune to assessthese problems and opportunities jointly with particular reference to:  (a) the significance for Commonwealth countries of changes taking place in world trade;(b) measures to expand trade between Commonwealth countries;(c) progress towards the common objectives of freer trade and payments;(d) the progress and direction of economic expansion in the less-developed countries of the Commonwealth and the sources of capital and technical assistance that may aid in their further development;ie) economic and trade problems in regard to agriculture and other primaryproductions;
Appendix BEXPLANATORY NOTES ON CONFERENCE AGENDAItem 1This item will cover discussion of world economic developments and theexpansion of trade between the Commonwealth and the rest of the world.Subsidiary topics for consideration, which are inter-related, will include:  (i) an assessment of the impact on world trade and payments, and on commonwealth countries in particular, of the various trends which aredeveloping, including trends in the United States economy anddevelopment of United States policies;(ii) questions of Commonwealth economic relations with the Sino-Soviet bloc;(iii) the problem of shortage of reserves and liquidity both in the short and thelong term.Under (iii) the following aspects might be examined:  (a) the world price of gold and its impact on the problem of internationalpayments and on gold production;(b) the roles of creditor countries and possible courses of action to dealwith the liquidity problem;(c) the importance of sterling as an international currency andco-operative measures to strengthen it.A special procedure might be followed for considering the gold item at theConference.Item 2This item would provide an opportunity to discuss matters of concern to commonwealth Governments in the field of intra-Commonwealth trade againstthe general economic and financial background emerging from Items 1 and 6.Ministers might start with an examination of the development of the present pattern of Commonwealth trade, and against this background, study questions of preferencesand quantitative restrictions; examine the impact of these and other factors, such asocean freight rates, on intra-Commonwealth trade and consider any proposals whichmight lead to the expansion of intra-Commonwealth trade.Item 3Under this heading the Conference would consider progress towards elimination of trade discrimination, convertibility of currencies, and related matters; and examine the impact of regional developments on such progress.Item 4This item would cover the general trade situation of primary producing countries, and particular problems such as agricultural protection, includingsubsidies and other barriers to trade in primary products and raw materials. Itcould also cover surplus disposals, stockpiling policies, commodity prices and international commodity arrangements. Any proposals for stabilisation of prices could be examined.(/) the prospects and implications especially for Commonwealth countries ofthe European Economic Community and the proposed Free Trade Area;(g) arrangements for continuing Commonwealth consultation on economic matters.It was agreed that the detailed preparatory work for the Conference includingthe formulation of the agenda and other procedural matters should be entrusted to a committee of officials and that this committee should be convened in Londonearly in 1958.
Item 5This item would cover discussion of the implications of the latest availablebalance of payments forecasts (on both current and capital account) for the sterling area, both in relation to the fundamental issue of strengthening sterling and to theeconomic situation of Commonwealth countries, e.g., the effect on their exchangereserves. This may lead on to some consideration of the policies that might befollowed collectively and individually by Commonwealth Governments in the lightof the balance of payments picture which emerges.Item 6Under this item Ministers could examine problems arising in the developmentof Commonwealth countries and possible means of overcoming the difficulties involved. They could examine the considerations which impede the generationand flow of capital; the existing institutional and organisational arrangements and what they have achieved; the possibility of developing new institutionalarrangements. They might also consider the problems of commercial credit inrelation to the export of capital goods and the sources and arrangements forprovision of technical assistance.Item 7Under this item the existing arrangements for continuing Commonwealthconsultation on economic matters might be brought under review, and consideration might be given to the adequacy of these arrangements and to proposals for improving or adding to them.Item 8This item would provide an opportunity for Ministers to take further accountof the effects on individual Commonwealth countries of the Treaty of Rome; andthe United Kingdom could report on the state or outcome of the European free trade Area negotiations. It would provide an opportunity for an exchange of views between Ministers on the impact of the Treaty of Rome and the Free trade area on the GATT.

Appendix DSURVEY OF PRINCIPAL COMMODITIESI. Commodities covered by International Agreements actual or prospectiveWheatThe Australian and Canadian representatives believed that, despite the absenceof the United Kingdom as a participant, the International Wheat Agreement had brought stability to wheat prices, although admittedly it was still defective in certain respects. A Conference will be held early in 1959 in order to arrange the renewal of the Agreement. The United Kingdom would participate in such discussions.The hope was expressed by a number of Delegations that the United kingdom would see its way to rejoin the Agreement, and those Delegations were preparedagain to re-examine all points of difficulty.Reference was also made to the fact that production of wheat in western europe at support prices higher even than United States support levels exceededproduction in the United States of America itself. This emphasised the problem for the international trade in wheat that must be faced in the near future in viewof the possibility of a managed agriculture associated with European integration.SugarIt was agreed that both the International Sugar Agreement and theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement had been of value in helping to stabilise sugarprices. The International Sugar Agreement will be reviewed at an international conference in September 1958. It was desirable that the Agreement should becontinued and that Commonwealth countries should where possible work for the strengthening of the Agreement, e.g., by the accession of new members. TheCommonwealth Sugar Agreement is at present in force until 1965.TinIt was recognised that during the two years of its life the Tin Agreement hadbeen useful despite the severe strain to which it had been subject in maintaining the present floor price. It was desirable that it should be continued and additionalmembership sought.Olive OilIt was noted that this scheme (which affected only one Commonwealthproducer Cyprus) was about to be launched. The United Kingdom had signifiedits readiness to join as a consumer.II. International action currently in progress to examine commoditystabilisationRubberIt was noted that the formulation of a satisfactory stabilisation scheme forrubber would present serious difficulties having regard to (i) the relationship withsynthetic rubber and (ii) the need for the participation of the United States and(iii) the difficulty of effective participation by Indonesia. The International RubberStudy Group had devoted much attention to the problem and was currently engagedin some further study of it. The hope was expressed that despite the difficultiesthe study would point the way to a possible scheme.Non-ferrous MetalsIt was noted that separate conferences were being convened in September,under the auspices of the Interim Committee for the Co-ordination of international commodity Arrangements (I.C.C.I.C.A.) when the possibility of international action would be considered in respect of (i) copper and (ii) lead and zinc. Thehope was expressed that interested Commonwealth Governments would participate in these discussions and do their best to make them successful. It was recognisedthat it would almost certainly be necessary for any remedial action to be taken on a wide international basis.  In the event of an international scheme proving
impossible, the possibility of some action by the Commonwealth countries aloneshould be examined, although it was recognised that there were likely to be serious difficulties about this.III. Limited action in progress or contemplatedTeaInformal discussions about the possibility of resuscitating a tea regulationscheme were about to begin between representatives of India, Pakistan, ceylon and Indonesia. The hope was expressed that the East African territories might agree to join such discussions at the appropriate time.IV. International discussions proceeding but no Commonwealth action necessary at presentCoconuts and Coconut productsIt was noted that an International Study Group is to meet in the Philippinesto discuss these products. It was agreed that pending such study no action by commonwealth Governments was called for at present.Coarse GrainsA working party of the F.A.O. is considering the coarse grain situation. Theproblem is, however, a very complicated one due to the multiplicity of varietiesand sources of supply. It was agreed that no additional action by commonwealth governments was necessary at present.CoffeeA meeting had been convened in Washington between representatives of anumber of coffee producing countries and some consumers. The question of whether (i) any scheme would result from the meeting, or (ii) East African territories would wish to participate in any such scheme was still uncertain.CocoaA meeting of the International Cocoa Study Group was held in Hamburg from16th-23rd May, 1958. It had not proved possible to reach agreement on a commodity scheme. The Government of Ghana recognised that there was littlepossibility of a scheme at the present time. There might, however, be a need fora scheme at some future time.V. Situation dominated by United States disposals policiesCottonIt was recognised that a feasible commodity scheme for cotton would be most difficult to devise, given the multiplicity of varieties. The basic factor in the cottonsituation was United States support price and disposals policies. It was highly desirable to avoid a situation in which the United States sold its surpluses abroadirrespective of the damage which might be done to Commonwealth and otherproducers. It might well be advantageous for Commonwealth Governments, eithercollectively or individually, to make representations to the United states administration on this subject. Commonwealth Governments should considerwhether, in the context of increasing intra-Commonwealth trade on a non-discriminatory basis, they could encourage increased purchases within their countries of Commonwealth cotton.VI. Situation dominated by protectionist policiesMeatIt was agreed that for meat the problems essentially centred upon (i) undulyhigh price supports in certain countries, (ii) protective policies, including subsidies and quantitative restrictions, in many countries and (iii) the effect of quarantineregulations, e.g., in the United States, Germany.SECRET53623 F
Dairy produce the same broad factors applied as in the case of meat, but with dairy produce the problem was more urgent and acute. International co-operation as well as national action was required to minimise the damage being done to the international trade in dairy products through protectionist policies. Some international action had already been initiated in the F.A.O. and O.E.E.C. and this should be continued and intensified as much as possible.JuteNo question arose of a stabilisation scheme. The problem here was aggravated by the protection given by the United Kingdom and certain European countries to the domestic production of jute goods. The representative of India urged thatit was most desirable that these protective measures should be reduced or eliminated.VII. NO IMMEDIATE INTERNATIONAL OR COMMONWEALTH ACTION NECESSARYSisalWhile the recent trend of prices has given concern to producers in commonwealth countries, it was agreed that no concerted action by way of aninternational stabilisation scheme or on the part of Commonwealth countriescollectively was called for at present.WoolThis was not a product which called for consideration at the present time byany international or Commonwealth group. It was noted that suitable machineryalready existed for international consultation.RiceThe F.A.O. Sub-Committee is devoting attention to certain problems ofproduction and marketing but it has not as yet been thought necessary to considerthe question of a price stabilisation scheme.APPENDIX EEXISTING ARRANGEMENTS FOR COMMONWEALTH CONSULTATIONOrdinary Channels1. The normal method of consultation between the United Kingdom andother Commonwealth Governments is by telegram and letter through theCommonwealth Relations Office in London and either the United Kingdom high commissioners in other Commonwealth countries or Commonwealth high commissioners in London. There is a great deal of correspondence through these channels, both on daily matters and on long-term problems. In addition,the presence of Commonwealth economic representatives in London enables a wide range of personal contacts, both as between members of High Commissioners&apos;offices, and between them and Ministries concerned with economic and financialaffairs in Whitehall. Similarly, other Commonwealth Governments havemachinery for mutual consultation through their High Commissioners in eachother&apos;s capitals. In the nature of things, it is on these channels that theCommonwealth^ main reliance for effective machinery must depend.The Commonwealth Liaison committee. This Committee was established in 1948 to supplement existing channelsfor keeping Commonwealth countries fully informed on matters connected withthe European Recovery programme. In 1949 its functions were expanded to coverdiscussion of financial and economic questions of general Commonwealth interest,and in 1955 it took over the remaining functions of the former Sterling AreaStatistical Committee. It meets frequently in London, ordinarily every two orthree weeks, but more often if necessary. Its principal role is to act as a forum for the exchange of information and views on current questions and since 1956it has been of particular value for the discussion of developments relating to the
European Economic Community and the European Free Trade Area negotiations.In addition, following discussion of the Committee&apos;s functions at theCommonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; Meeting in 1954, the Committee hasoccasionally and with sufficient notice for Commonwealth Governments to brieftheir representatives, discussed longer term questions, and senior officials from commonwealth capitals have sometimes attended special meetings. TheCommittee does not attempt to formulate co-ordinated views but helps to provideGovernments with the background information to enable each of them to decide on their own policies. Minutes of its meetings are circulated to all commonwealth governments. Telegrams are sent in advance of minutes if the subject mattermerits urgent communication.Meetings between the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and commonwealth High Commissioners3. It has long been the practice for the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to meet Commonwealth High Commissioners collectively as occasionrequires. He holds such meetings periodically to enable United Kingdom ministers concerned with the Free Trade Area negotiations to discuss these negotiationswith High Commissioners.Personal Messages4. When desirable, personal messages on economic matters are exchangedwith the Ministers of other Commonwealth Governments by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations or other United Kingdom Ministers. TheChancellor of the Exchequer sends a regular monthly message on the state of thegold and dollar reserves and the position of sterling direct to other commonwealth finance Ministers and receives messages direct from them. He also communicateswith them on other matters. The Paymaster-General, who is the Minister in theUnited Kingdom Cabinet charged with the responsibility for conducting the UnitedKingdom Governments negotiations for a Free Trade Area, sends personalmessages direct to the Ministers concerned in other Commonwealth Governments,the latter, of course, being free to correspond directly with him in the same way.Conferences: ministers. Since 1945 there has been one plenary Commonwealth EconomicConference, in 1952, similar in character to the Conference which is to be heldin Montreal this September. Meetings of Commonwealth Prime Ministers sincethe war have also usually in some part dealt with matters of common economicand financial concern. In addition, there have been meetings of commonwealth finance Ministers in July 1949, January 1952 and January 1954. In September1954 Commonwealth Finance Ministers met after the annual meeting of theI.B.R.D. and I.M.F. Since then the practice has arisen for Commonwealth finance ministers to take the opportunity of this annual Bank-Fund Meeting to hold an informal meeting to discuss matters of mutual concern. The adoption of this practice has had the advantage of preventing the risk of speculative movements in sterling which meetings of Finance Ministers held at irregular intervals and perhaps in an atmosphere of crisis might occasion.Conferences: Officials6. Since 1955 the practice has developed of holding regular meetings of commonwealth officials concerned with balance of payments statistics. before then, a number of similar meetings were held in connection with theCommonwealth Economic Conference of 1952 and with meetings of commonwealth Finance Ministers. A similar meeting was held in May 1958in connection with the forthcoming Commonwealth Trade and EconomicConference. Conferences of British Commonwealth Statisticians were held on two occasions before the war, and the Conference has since been revived as a regular event at five-yearly intervals; Conferences were held in Canberra in 1951and London in 1956. Official meetings have been held on an ad hoc basis fromtime to time, for instance that held in 1957 to discuss the European economic community and Free Trade Area. There is a regular practice of commonwealth representatives at the GATT Sessions meeting before the Sessions. It is alsocommonly the practice of Commonwealth Delegations on international economic
Specialised Organisations7. There are a number of specialised Commonwealth organisations which,to some extent or other, come within the province of Commonwealth economicconsultation. These are the British Commonwealth Scientific Offices, theCommonwealth Agricultural Bureaux, the Commonwealth Air Transport Council,the Commonwealth Shipping Committee, the Commonwealth TelecommunicationsBoard, the Empire Forestry Association, the Commonwealth Institute and theStanding Committee on British Commonwealth Forestry.The Commonwealth Economic committee. This Committee was set up in 1925 as a result of the Imperial EconomicConference of 1923, and its original terms of reference have been enlarged fromtime to time by subsequent Imperial Conferences. The functions of the Committeeare to provide economic and statistical services on subjects affectingCommonwealth production and trade, as well as to examine and report on any economic questions which member Governments refer to it. This work is atpresent performed by means of (a) reports to Governments on economic questions of common interest;(b) the regular issue of economic information on the production, trade and consumption of important commodities; and(c) the provision of supplementary information on subjects coming withinthe Committee&apos;s general field of activity.The Committee consists of members nominated by their respective Governments.It is financed by contributions from all the Governments of the commonwealth and reports to those Governments. Its work is factual and analytical. Thepublications of the Committee include Reports to Governments, and regular orperiodic publications in commodity series and of Intelligence Services. (TheCommittee is at present considering whether its scope could be further expandedas a result of a remit of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in June 1957.)bodies and at international conferences of an economic nature, to maintain a closeliaison among themselves. The meetings of the Consultative Committee of the colombo Plan in particular provide a helpful opportunity to the officials of member Governments for informal discussion of development problems.
