July I95SC (58) 170 Copy No.29th July. 195SCABINETCIVIL AVIATION: KUWAIT AIRLINEMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Civil aviation at the Cabinet meeting on 15th April (C.C. (58) 31st Conclusions 3) thePrime Minister asked that the situation over Kuwait Airways should be jointlyreviewed by the Foreign Secretary and myself and recommendations submittedto him.2. In a minute to the Prime Minister of 21st April the Foreign Secretaryexplained that, after protracted negotiations with Kuwait Airways, neither british overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) or its associate Middle East Airlines(M.E.A.) (a Lebanese company in which B.O.A.C. have a financial interest and considerable influence) had been able to conclude an agreement. Thus a vacuumwas left which outside elements might fill. Some of these, e.g., an Egyptian airline,would have been very undesirable politically. The Foreign Secretaryrecommended that Hunting Clan, an independent British operator who was interested, should negotiate with Kuwait Airways but that negotiations shouldnot be allowed to break down without reference to Ministers. In his minute theForeign Secretary drew attention to the problem which arises when B.O.A.C.cannot commercially justify activities desirable in the wider national interest. ThePrime Minister agreed the recommendations.3. Subsequently, Hunting Clan reported that the best deal likely requiredan indemnity by Her Majesty&apos;s Government against losses up to  150,000. Theywere informed that there could be no underwriting or subsidy and efforts weremade to solve the situation by promoting an understanding between Hunting Clan,B.O.A.C. and M.E.A., but Hunting Clan decided to withdraw. B.O.A.C. thenreceived an unexpectedly favourable response to a last appeal made on a personalbasis to the Chairman of Kuwait Airways.4. The Chairman of B.O.A.C. informed me that this reply reopened thepossibility of an agreement on lines which had been tentatively but unsuccessfullysuggested before, but B.O.A.C. still considered their probable costs, includingliability for losses and for interest on the capital of their Arab partners, wouldoutweigh the commercial advantages, even though B.O.A.C. would have themanagement and operational and commercial control.5. However, the peak traffic season being imminent, this offered both a finaland urgent opportunity to retain the British aviation interest in Kuwait. i therefore asked the Corporation, in the national interest, to reopen negotiations and to conclude an agreement on the best terms possible even if it involved themin a loss. This they agreed to do and a contract was signed in time to beginoperations early in June as required by the Kuwaitis.6. The Chairman of B.O.A.C. tells me that the contract guarantees KuwaitAirways a minimum profit of  22,500 per annum and the equal sharing of anyprofits in excess of this sum. It is not yet possible to assess the full financial implications but an initial rough estimate suggests that B.O.A.C. may incur a lossof  100,000 at any rate in the first year which will be one of exceptional difficulty.

7. In asking the Corporation to negotiate this contract, I assured theChairman that B.O.A.C. would not be expected to take responsibility for any loss necessarily incurred. This does not necessarily mean, that a subsidy will bepaid, but it may mean that B.O.A.C. will feel obliged in their Accounts for 1958-59to draw attention to the fact that they include a commitment incurred at therequest of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.8. I thought my colleagues should know the final outcome of these negotiations.H. W.Ministry of Transport and Civil A aviation, W. I,28th July, 1958.CONFIDENTIAL
