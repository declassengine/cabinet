(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 172 COPY NO. ST/30th July, 1958CABINETCIVIL AVIATION;  JET AIRCRAFT NOISEMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and civil aviation have repeatedly said in Parliament and elsewhere that, beforeallowing the new big jet aircraft to have unrestricted use of Governmentairports in build-up areas, I must be satisfied that the level of noise isnot such as to cause intolerable disturbance.    In adopting this attitudeI have been keeping in step with the Port of New York Authority.2.      These aircraft cannot be banned from our airports indefinitelyand, now that aircraft designers are taking noise reduction seriously, thetime has come to consider the conditions under which they might beallowed to operate.    The Port of New York Authority has now allowed the boeing 707-120, equipped with JT3C-6 engines and noise suppressors, to begin trial runs, subject to certain restrictions and I am sure we mustmove in the same direction.3.      Unfortunately for us, the problem faces us first with the RussianTU. 104.    When we entered into an agreement with the Russians forreciprocal British European Airways and Aeroflot services between thetwo countries, it was on the explicit understanding that we must besatisfied, before services began, that the noise level of the TU. 104 wasnot unacceptable to us.    We were given to understand that the russians would fit noise suppressors and submit the aircraft to tests by ourexperts.4.      This has not been done.    Meanwhile, Aeroflot has commencedoperations between Moscow and Amsterdam, and between Moscow andBrussels and will shortly operate also to Paris.    Thus British EuropeanAirways1 projected service to Moscow is being held back, while their competitors in the Netherlands, Belgium and France are enabled to flyinto Moscow.5.     I have recently learned, through airline channels, that Aeroflothave found themselves unable to fit noise suppressors to the TU. 104without an unacceptable loss of power.    Despite repeated reminders, Ihave not had this information direct from the Russian Government.    Afurther reminder has been sent within the last few days.    I have noreason to suppose that the Russian difficulty in reducing the noise of theTU. 104 is not genuine and in face of the attitude of the continental countries mentioned above, we are in danger of being regarded asobstructive for political rather than practical motives.    At the same time,I must have regard to feelings of residents around London Airport, theonly airport which, for a variety of reasons, can be used for a regularAeroflot service.-1-SECRET
SECRET-    1086.     In all the circumstances, I propose, even if I do not within a week or two hear directly from the Russian Government on the subject, to announce that I should be prepared to allow the TU.104 to operate toand from London Airport subject to certain fairly severe restrictions,which I would specify in my announcement.    I am studying what these should be.    They will certainly have to include operations only during&quot;waking&quot; hours and they may involve weight limitations and particularoperating techniques in order to keep noise to a minimum.    It follows that when the time comes, other big jet aircraft would also be allowedto use London Airport.    I propose, however, to suit the conditions ineach case to the noise characteristics of the particular aircraft.    TheComet has a much lower noise level than other jet aircraft and from present evidence it does not appear that any restriction will be called for.7.     I should be glad to know that my colleagues agree with what i propose.H.W.Ministry of Transport and CivilAviation, W.l.29th July, 1958.-2-
