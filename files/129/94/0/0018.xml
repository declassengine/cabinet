(58) 168 Copy No.8th August, 195SCABINETEGYPT: FINANCIAL negotiations note by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate notes by officials on the present state of the financial negotiations with Egypt.(Signed) NORMAN  BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th August, 1958.53864a
SECRETEGYPT : FINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONSINOTE BY OFFICIALSTalks have been held in Geneva with Dr. Emary, Governor of the NationalBank of Egypt, from 29th July to 2nd August, on the lines approved by the Cabinet(C.C. (58) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 4). These were that the Delegation were authorised to offer a lump sum of  35 millions with sequestration charges of 2 millions plus a bonus of up to  5 millions, as a means of inducing the Egyptiansto advance on their previous offer ol a lump sum of  25 millions. A report by the leader of the United Kingdom delegation is attached (II).2.   It emerged from these talks:  (a) that the Egyptians are not prepared to advance on their figure of 25 millions. We therefore made no offer to reduce our own figure of 35 millions;(b) that the Egyptians estimate that  4-5 millions (in Egyptian pounds) are due in sequestration charges. Of this  2 millions are payable on revenues ofsequestrated property, and for the most part has already been collected.The remainder,  2-5 millions, is the charge on the sale price ofEgyptianised property. The Egyptians maintain that this cannot be collected from the new Egyptian owners, and that it must therefore bepaid either by the owners of property now under sequestration or must come out of the lump sum.3.   There appear therefore to be three courses open to us:  (a) If it is considered that, for political reasons, we should seek a very early agreement with Egypt, we could accept the Egyptian terms. In form, thismeans a lump sum of  25 millions, but, unless we are prepared to see theowners of desequestrated property pay the  2-5 millions sequestrationcharges on Egyptianised property, the net figure would be  22-5 millions.(b) We could wait and see whether the Egyptians were prepared to modify their attitude.(c) We could put forward a compromise offer of our own.   This might rangebetween:  (i) a gross figure of  30 millions, less  2 - 5 millions for the sequestrationcharges on Egyptianised property, giving a net figure of 27-5 millions;(ii) a gross figure of  27-5 millions which, on the same basis, would leave a net figure of  25 millions.4. Which course should be adopted involves primarily a political decision.The factors to be weighed in reaching this are principally:  (a) An agreement at this juncture would give Nasser  40 millions at his freedisposal.(b) It would be idle to think that such an agreement would buy his good behaviour.(c) On the other hand, we are losing trade at the rate of some  10 millions ayear and the Germans and the Japanese are trying to dig themselvesinto our old position,(r/) We need Egypt and Syria for our commercial sea and air communications.(e) There will never be a good moment for reaching an agreement, and if wewait too long we shall find ourselves in the same position as the americans towards China.(/) It would be useful to have diplomatic relations to obtain reports of eventsat first hand and to talk to the Egyptians face to face.   We believe that most of our Arab friends would welcome a restoration of our relationswith the United Arab Republic.53864
(g) The property is deteriorating and the longer we delay an agreement themore we are likely to have to pay by way of compensation.(h) The present position cannot be maintained indefinitely.   Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment would be subjected to strong pressure either to seize the sterling balances (which would have serious consequences for confidence in sterling) or to pay full compensation from the Exchequer (whichwould involve a very&apos;heavy liability) For this reason, we should need to obtain an agreement soon and the issues to be considered wouldbe those of timing and tactics rather than principle.5. The balance of the above arguments would seem to favour making afurther effort to reach an early agreement with the Egyptians. Since they will not accept our proposals, the choice for us is either to put forward a compromise orto accept their oiler. We need not yet resign ourselves to abandoning any attempt at improving the Egyptian olTer. However, we do not think that the Egyptiansare themselves likeiy to propose a compromise nearer tc our own point of view.Therefore, the initiative must be with us.6. For this purpose, we have the opportunity to deal with Dr. Emary inSwitzerland until he leaves on 18th August. (If an early Summit meeting had beenin prospect, there would have been much to be said for leaving the subject to beraised on the side with the Egyptians there.  It is as much political as financial.)7. In the circumstances, we recommend that we should try for a compromise between the limits in paragraph 2 (c) above, viz.,  30 millions gross ( 27-5 millionsnet) and  27-5 millions gross ( 25 millions net). We should, at the same time,repeat that the signature of an agreement would be conditional on a satisfactory agreement with Shell, with whom the Egyptians have just resumed direct negotiations.S. We must recognise that if we are to take the initiative in this way, weshall be in a weak negotiating position, and may be left with the alternative of accepting the Egyptian terms and having no agreement at all.9. If an agreement can be reached on the figures, there should be no difficultvin settling the other points, such as capital transfers and payments to the officialsdismissed in 1951, which Dr. Emary seems ready to accept without demur.6th August, 1958.IIMINUTE BY THE LEADER OF THE UNITED KINGDOM DELEGATIONI attach (III) a report on the talks in Geneva with Dr. Emary.2. The net result is that we have made some useful progress on the text ofthe draft agreement on which there are now no major points of differenceoutstanding. The difficulty is over the figures. On sequestration charges they want  41 millions (in Egyptian pounds). We did not name a figure but could hardlyaccept more than  2 millions except in return for agreement on the lump sum. here the gap is still between  25 millions and  35 millions.3. In conversation with Mr. Hamilton, Dr. Koestner save him to understandthat Dr. Emary was prepared to accept a figure in the region of  35 millions. Hewould feel pleased if he got something below this.4. The final breakdown appeared to be due to instructions from Cairoreceived only towards the close of the talks. The order was &quot; no concessions.&quot;The reason for this we cannot tell, but we know from past experience that PresidentNasser is apt to refuse his negotiators the concessions they ask for.5. There is evidence that the Egyptians are still very short of foreign exchange and unless they get an agreement with us or help from some other quarter will haveto sell gold from the currency cover before long.6. It looks as if they are about to reach agreement with the French. Thiswill leave us looking rather out in the cold but it will not earn them anythingsubstantial in transferable currency.  It will however help them to sell their cotton.
7. Dr. Emary was most friendly throughout and particularly at our farewellmeeting.  I think he would still like an agreement soon.(Signed) D. H. F. RICKETT.IllREPORT BV THE UNITED KINGDOM delegation from 29th July to 1st August we had a second series of meetings in Genevawith Dr. Emary, Governor of the National Bank of Egypt, and sought to reach agreement on the lines approved by the Cabinet (C.C. (58) 62nd Conclusions,Minute 4). It was hoped to obtain a lump sum of  35 millions; but in return forthis we were authorised either:(a) to add not more than  5 millions to a reasonable figure (say  2 millions)for the sequestration charges payable in Egyptian pounds; or(b) to offer to compound all sequestration charges for a reduction in the lump sum which would thus become a net payment.Talks on this ended on 1st August when Dr. Emary stated that he had definite instructions not to offer more than  25 millions with sequestration chargesamounting to  4-5 millions.2. Before leaving for Geneva we had asked Dr. Emary for full details of thecharges levied by the Sequestrator-General on British property and for an estimateof the further amounts likely to be levied under existing Egyptian legislation. a tour first meeting on 29th July Dr. Emary stated that about  E.4 millions was estimated to be due in sequestration charges up to the present time. Of this E.1 -8 millions represented a levy of 10 per cent, on the gross receipts from british property from November 1956 to the present date, while  E.2-2 millionsrepresented a levy of 10 per cent, on the estimated sale proceeds of British property.We said that charges under this latter head should clearly be regarded as havingbeen taken into account in the calculation of the lump sum. Dr. Emary disagreedand thought that they should either be deducted from the lump sum or be borneby owners of property still under sequestration. He said that he was still awaitingfull answers on the points on which we had requested information. We stressed the importance of full information about sales of property and all- charges leviedon it. We did not discuss the size of the lump sum; but we made it clear that wecould not agree on a figure if sales of British property were continuing. Dr. Emaryaccepted this point.3. At our second meeting on 30th July Dr. Emary stated that he was stillawaiting the answers to our questions. In ihe meantime after discussion withdraw. Zaki, Egyptian Minister of Finance, he had come to the conclusion thatthe total of sequestration charges would have to be kept separate from the decisionon the amount of the lump sum, on which he again avoided discussion. He thensaid that his Government were sending out their legal expert. Dr. Afia, who shouldbe able to deal with all outstanding textual points in the draft Agreement by theend of the week. If agreement on the amount of the lump sum and sequestrationcharges were reached, there should remain little to do to complete it and arrangefor its signature. The following day Dr. Emary told us that he was still awaitinga reply from Cairo and in the meantime had nothing to add to what he had said.In the course of discussion on the text of the draft Agreement Dr. Emary agreedto consider a proposal that the rate of exchange for pre-zero applications for capital transfers should be the official rate in force at the time when the applications were made.4. At our third meeting on the morning of 1st August Dr. Emary reportedthat he had received the figures requested. These showed that the Sequestrator-GeneraFs expenses had amounted to  E.4-5 millions, of which  E.2 millions wouki1by the end of August be covered by his 10 per cent, charge on gross receipts fromBritish property under sequestration. He reiterated that the remaining  E.2-millions would have to be collected from owners of sequestrated property. Itcould not be collected from the Egyptian purchasers of Egyptianised property
since they had already paid the price fixed by the Valuation Commission. moreover the total value of all Egyptianised property as assessed by the Commission would only amount to about  E.22 millions which was already short of the  25 millions which he (Dr. Emary) had in mind for the lump sum; and there was no question ofthe Egyptian Governments finding the money out of its budget. UnfortunatelyDr. Alia had been delayed en route to Geneva; and it proved impossible at thismeeting to make any progress on outstanding issues. Later, however, at lunchDr. Emary told Sir Denis Rickett that he had full powers to initial an agreement which, if completed by the week-end, would only require final signature to enterinto effect.5. Accompanied by Dr. Alia Dr. Emary continued the talks in the evening.He produced a list of Egyptianised property which seemed generally to tally withthe information at our disposal. He also reported that all properties of under200 feddans of agricultural land had been Egyptianised (the value of these is not known). He then took Sir Denis Rickett aside and reported that he had deliniieinstructions not to offer more than  25 millions for the lump sum withsequestration charges totalling  E.4-5 millions and asked if this was acceptableor, alternatively, whether Sir Denis Rickett would make a counter-proposal,though he could not ask for this. In subsequent discussion it seemed clear that noproposal on the lines of  35 millions minus a sum in respect of sequestrationcharges would stand any chance of acceptance by Dr. Emary, though he indicated that he would be willing to report back anything we could offer on the lines of 25 millions plus. Sir Denis Rickett said that there was no offer we could makeof this kind. He therefore agreed that it was not possible to make further progress,although the lawyers should meet under Mr. Crowe&apos;s chairmanship the following morning to settle outstanding drafting points in the text of the draft Agreement.At this meeting neither side was in a position to give away any points of substance,but Dr. Afia was most co-operative and good progress was made. We now have a text which should require very little work to be acceptable to both of us, once the major.issues are out of the way.6. During the course of our negotiations we stressed the importance of anagreement with Shell. Dr. Emary agreed and arrangements are in train for Shell&apos;representatives to visit Cairo on 5th August.7. In the course of his farewell conversation with Dr. Emary on 2nd AugustSir Denis Rickett indicated that, while we were not able to discuss a lump-sumunless it were in the region of  35 millions, he thought that something might stillbe done to meet Egyptian difficulties on the lines previously discussed, i.e., by offering something extra for sequestration charges. He added as a personalsuggestion that we might be willing to meet part of these additional charges bybuying Egyptian pounds for sterling provided tnat the Egyptian Government agreedthat the sterling should be used to finance capital transfers by United kingdom nationals from Egypt (over and above the  5,000 per head already provided for under the draft Agreement). Dr. Emary took the point but gave no Indication thathe thought that such an arrangement would be acceptable. Nevertheless he partedexpressing the hope that agreement would be reached.8. Up to the moment of the evening meeting on 1st August Dr. Emary,while giving no direct indication that he was prepared to offer more than 25 millions, had given the impression that he thought&quot; that final agreement mishtwell be reached before the week-end. His final insistence that his instructionsprecluded any compromise above  25 millions thus came as somewhat of a surprise.In the absence of any clear evidence about the reasons for this apparent volte-facewe could only assume that he had either been hoping for &quot;some last-minuteconcession on our part or had been playing for time while awaiting a decision from cairo on his final instructions.  We believe that the latter is more probable.3rd August, 1958.
