IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENTI seek the authority of the Cabinet to introduce early in the nextParliamentary session a Bill to renew the expiring Navy, Army and AirForce Reserves Act, 1954 and to make certain extensions in the powersto call up reservists without a Proclamation.2.     Our forces should be capable of undertaking internal security duties and minor actions of short duration (e.g. , recent operations in cyprus, Muscat and Jordan) without having to recall reservists.    for limited war operations, it would be necessary, as in the Suez emergency,to recall a certain number of reservists in order to bring the unitsconcerned up to full strength and to provide certain additional supportingunits and administrative backing.    In the event of a threat of global war,it would be necessary to recall very large numbers of reservists toundertake home defence duties (including Civil Defence) and to reinforceour forces on the Continent.Territorial Army3.      It is politically desirable that the reservists required for limitedwar operations should be able to be recalled without having to issue a proclamation which gives the impression of a grave national emergency.4.     The Government at present have power to recall without a proclamation, for oversea service, Section A of the Regular army reserve, and Category 1 of the Army Emergency Reserve.    However,the numbers available from these sources are insufficient to meet ourlikely requirements for limited war operations.5.     It is therefore proposed to establish a special section of theTerritorial Army, to be composed of men who voluntarily accept a liability to be embodied for service at home or overseas without a proclamation.    In return, they would receive a special bounty, inaddition to their mobilisation gratuity.6.      This proposal would not involve increasing the maximum of45,000 reservists, who, under the existing laws, may be called up withouta Proclamation.Renewal of 1954 Act7.      In the event of global war or major emergency, it will continueto be necessary for all three Services to rely on reservists whose-1-C.(58) 19425th September, 1958CABINETRESERVE FORCES bill memorandum by the Minister of Defence
liability to recall rests on the Navy, Army and Air Force ReservesAct of 1954 (i. e. , regulars and national servicemen who have completed their normal period of reserve service).   This Act expiresin June, 1959.    It is therefore proposed to renew it for a further fiveyears, but to restrict its application to men who joined the Forcesafter 1948, thus excluding the older men called up under war-timepowers.recommendation. I accordingly ask the Cabinet to approve that legislation shouldbe introduced early in the coming session:-(a) to create a special section of the Territorial Army,composed of men who voluntarily accept a liability to be embodied without a Proclamation;(b) to renew the expiring Navy, Army and Air ForceReserves Act, 1954 for a further five years, inrespect of men who joined the forces after 1948.D.S.25th September, 1958.-2-
