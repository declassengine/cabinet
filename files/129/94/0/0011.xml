HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 16121st July, 1958COPY NOJLLCABINETFINANCIAL TALKS WITH EGYPTNote by the Chancellor of the exchequer attach a note by officials which incorporates a report of the talksrecently held in Geneva between the Governor of the National Bank ofEgypt, Dr. Emary, and the Treasury representative.2.        The upshot of these talks was that Dr. Emary would be willingto recommend a lump sum payment by the Egyptian Government of 35 millions on the understanding that there should be some increase inthe sequestration charges which would be payable on British property.He mentioned a figure of  2 millions to  3 millions but he is not committed to this, and has asked for as much as  10 millions.3.        I think this proposal may provide a satisfactory solution and i recommend that it should be explored in further informal talks.   i recognise that in present circumstances we may not wish to conclude anagreement which would release a large part of the Egyptian sterling balancesEven if, however, an agreement in principle was reached in this way, itwould still be necessary to resume formal negotiations and complete the drafting of the agreement.   We could always delay this final stage ifnecessary.D.H.A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.21st July, 1958X
ANGLO- EG Y FT IAN FINANCIAL negotiations note by officials on 1st July the Cabinet approved in principle the resumption offinancial negotiations with the Egyptian Government on the basis indicatedin C.(58) 133 (C.C.(58) 51st Conclusions, Minute 4).   The Treasuryrepresentative, Sir Denis Rickett, accordingly held three meetings in geneva with Dr. Emary, Governor of the National Bank of Egypt, between12th and 15th July.   A copy of his report is attached at Appendix I.2.        From this it seems clear that it should be possible to reach anearly agreement with Egypt on the lines discussed below.   But ministers will wish to decide whether in the present circumstances they agree that negotiations should be continued on the present informal basis.   If agree-ment can be reached on the general principles and size of a lump sumsettlement, formal negotiations on the text ^f an agreement would still be needed.3.         There are the following advantages in continuing discussions withdraw. Emary:-(a) the discussions are secret and have attracted no publicityhere;(b) if agreement can be reached in principle it will be moredifficult for the Egyptians later to raise their terms;(c) if, for any reason, we subsequently wished to defer theconclusion of a final agreement, it would still be possibleto adopt delaying tactics during the final discussions aboutdrafting;(d) there would be no releases of sterling until the final Agreementcame into effect.It would, however, clearly be unwise to continue discussions with Dr. Emaryunless our intention was to reach agreement with him in principle in thenear future.   Otherwise, we should risk undoing the progress so far made.Possible basis for agreement4.        Hitherto we have been concentrating on first reaching agreement onthe amount of the lump sum on the assumption that it would thereafter bepossible to reach agreement quickly on the other outstanding issues.Dr. Emary has now suggested that it might be possible for the Egyptiansto accept a figure of  35 millions for the lump sum if we for our part could agree to find some way of increasing the yield to Egypt from sequestrationcharges (by, say,  2-3 millions).5.        Under Egyptian law the Sequestrator-General is entitled to levy atleast 10 per cent on gross receipts of all property in his charge, and tolevy 10 per cent on the prices realised from the sale of property and frommaturing loans, etc.   These charges are clearly not related to theSequestrator-General&apos;s administrative costs.   They could conceivably-1-
amount to many million pounds, depending on how they were applied since,according to the claims registered with the Foreign Office, there is about 180 millions worth of British property in Egypt.   As an opening bid in our negotiations we have already proposed that sequestration charges shouldnot exceed 2 per cent on net income plus a small percentage on bankbalances; but it is clear that the Egyptians would not agree to this.   It is unlikely that in any event we should want to break off negotiations on thispoint alone.   The French are apparently prepared to accept the Egyptianlegislation.6.        From a negotiating point of view therefore there are advantages inlinking together the amounts of the lump sum and of sequestration charges,since thereby we might secure concessions from the Egyptians in returnfor modifications that we would always have been ready to make.   Moreover,we should be increasing the lump sum which is payable in sterling by adding to sequestration charges whi^?. are payable in Egyptian pounds (if we adoptthe method in paragraph 9(a) below).7.        We therefore consider that it should be possible to reach agreement on a lump sum if discussions were continued on the basis of Dr. Emary&apos;suggestion.   As a first step it will be necessary to agree on a reasonablefigure for the administrative expenses of the sequestrator which he is obviously entitled to recover.   For this our representatives might suggest,say,  1 million a year.8.        The next step would be to arrive at a figure for the additional sum to be levied in sequestration charges in consideration of a lump sum paymentof  35 millions.   We should endeavour to settle for  2 millions.   If our representatives feel obliged to go higher than this they could go to 5 millions as a maximum.9.        It would then be necessary to devise some means of levyingsequestration charges in such a way as to produce a sum equal to theadministrative expenses of sequestration plus the &quot;bonus&quot; in considerationof a higher lump sum.   Two methods seem possible:-(a) If the Egyptians insisted on applying their own legislation, theywould have to provide us with their valuation of the property liable tosequestration charges.   (So far as can be judged this would not necessarily be related to the total of the claimants&apos; estimates since in general assets which have produced no income appear to be exempt.)  This would show us the produce of a sequestration charge of X per cent.   It would also benecessary to know what amounts had already been exacted and on what basis.Under this arrangement, the Egyptians would collect the sequestrationcharges and those paying them might be permitted to claim in respect ofpart or all of them against the lump sum.(b) Alternatively, it might be simpler to compound sequestrationcharges against the lump sum which would thus become a net payment.While this would reduce its total it would be of considerable advantage to British owners to be relieved of this charge.   It would also preventextortionate charges by the Egyptians in contravention of the agreement.
SECRET - 6010.       If it is agreed that negotiations should be continued on the lines suggested, it is recommended that we should tell Dr.  Emary that we are ready to resume discussions on the basis of a compromise linking theamount of the lump sum with sequestration charges and that, for the purposeof these discussions, it would clearly be important that Dr. Emaryshould be able to provide information about the value of the assets liableto sequestration charges and of the amount collected up to date.Other points raised by Dr. Emary11.       During the course of his discussions Dr. Emary raised a numberof subsidiary points on the text of the draft Agreement which was handed to him.   These are discussed at Appendix II.18TH JULY,&apos;- 1958-3-
APPENDIX IANGLO-EGYPTIAN FINANCIAL NEGOTIATIONSReport of discussions between Dr. Emary andSir Denis Rickett in Geneva, lZth-15th July was in Geneva from Saturday, 12th July to Tuesday, 15th July.During that time I had three meetings with Dr. Emary.   On the secondevening we also had dinner together with Mr. Iliff of the International bank for Research and Development.2.        At our first meeting I handed over to Dr. Emary the revised draft agreement based on the principle of a lump sum payment.   I said that in agreeing to negotiate on this basis, we must not be taken to have acceptedthe figure of  25 millions which Dr. Emary had mentioned in his conversationwith Mr. Hamilton of the BanK of England.   We had been encouraged toconsider seriously the idea of a lump sum settlement only because, in his first conversation with Mr. Iliff on this subject, Dr. Emary had mentioneda figure of  40 millions as being a possible compromise between theEgyptian estimate of  25 millions for the value of our claim and the Briti shestimate of  55 millions.   This approach seemed to us to hold outpossibilities of negotiation.   But I saw no prospect of agreement with a figure as low as  25 millions.   Dr. Emary said that the figure of 40 millions made no allowance for Egyptian claims.   What he was askingwas that we should in effect pay  15 millions for war damage.   If we would do this they would write a letter stating that their war damage claim hadbeen offset against the value of the Canal Base.3.        I said that we recognised that the lump sum approach had certain advantages.   It enabled us to get over the difficulty about neutral arbitration,but it could not be used to conceal a substantial payment for war damage.If the United Kingdom Government accepted a figure as low as  25 millionsthey would have the greatest difficulty in explaining to Parliament why theyhad settled the British claims for so low a figure.   It would at once besuspected that the settlement concealed a payment for war damage and thiswould cause very serious political difficulty.   Nor could we justify asettlement, the benefits of which to the two parties would be so unequal,since out of the total Egyptian balances of  77 millions the egyptians would secure an immediate cash release of  52 millions while we shouldhave to settle our claims for the comparatively small sum of  25 millions.We could not accept anything appreciably below  40 millions but would consider any offer close to that figure,4.        Dr. Emary said that anything of the order of  40 millions wouldbe quite impossible for them.   It seemed to him that he had managed thingsvery badly.   In putting forward the figure of  25 millions he was giving onlya personal estimate of the figure at which it might be possible to reach agreement.   He had mentioned this figure to no-one on the Egyptian side.The official offer was  10 millions.5.        After a good deal of further discussion he undertook to ring upDr. Zaki - the Minister dealing with home finance - in Cairo and reportwhat I had said.   In the meantime he would study the draft agreement andhave a further meeting with me the next day,-4-SISGRET
6.        I raised the question of the Shell negotiations and asked what wasthe meaning of the statement he had given Mr. Hamilton that negotiations could be resumed but no useful purpose would be served by discussion ofthe organisation for the distribution of petroleum products.   Dr. Emarywas very vague on this point and it was clear that he was not familiar with the question which is a matter for the Ministry of Industry.   Iemphasised the importance of resuming the Shell negotiations and gettingsome result frim them before any agreement between Governments was signed.7.        At our second meeting Dr. Emary gave me a number of comments on the draft agreement (reported in telegram No. 348 from U.K. ^Delegation,Geneva, to Foreign Office).   The main point of substance was on sequestrationcharges where the Egyptians were still asking for a much higher percentageto be levied not only on income producing but als o on non-income producingassets.8.        Dr. Emary then said that he had consulted Dr. Zaki who had saidthat the figure of  40 millions was quite impossible.   He (Dr. Emary)was in some doubt how to proceed.   Perhaps the Egyptian Governmentshould now raise its offer from  10 millions to, say,  15 millions or 20 millions.   I said that this would have the worst possible effect on thenegotiations.   I-.would never have come to Geneva to discuss an Egyptianoffer of  10 millions.   If the only result of my visit was that the Egyptianoffer appeared to have been reduced from  25 millions to  20 millions,United Kingdom Ministers would feel that we were merely playing with thequestion.   Dr. Emary then said that he would require further time to consult Cairo.   He would send a copy of the draft agreement home bymessenger the next day, together with a full written account of our discussions and a recommendation to the Egyptian Government.   Could put off my departure for 24 hours and have lunch with him on the followingTuesday?  I said that I would certainly do this.9.        At our last meeting Dr. Emary said that he had been in touch withCairo and had now decided to offer  25 millions officially on behalf of theEgyptian Government.   He had been obliged to do this on his own responsibility.   Dr. Zaki had wished him to offer  17j millions.10.       I said that I was glad to hear that the offer of  25 millions was nowofficial, but for the reasons I had given at our first meeting, it was quiteunacceptable to us.   As I had told him then, we could not go substantially below  40 millions and  35 millions was our lowest figure.11.       After a good deal of further discussion, Dr. Emary said that itmight perhaps be possible for him to accept the figure of  35 millionsprovided that we could do something for him on sequestration charges.Perhaps we could find an extra  2 millions to  3 millions in this way.   I said that we would be prepared to examine what, if anything, could be doneon sequestration charges though we had to bear in mind the interests ofthe different classes of claimants.   The owners of sequestrated assetsincluded many small xoenland it would be impossible to place too much ofa burden on them.   Dr,. Emary then said that there should be no difficultyin finding an extra  10 millions by this means.   I reminded him that his request had been for  2 millions, and that I had certainly not agreed thatwe could find as much as that.   Wo could not agree to a scale of charges which would be manifestly unreasonable.-5-8ECHET
1Z.      Dr. Emary then reverted to the question of the exchange rate and asked why we could not fix the lump sum at E 35 millions.   This might then be converted into sterling at a discount of 15 per cent.   This would be considerably better than the present discount for export pounds of 25 per cent.13.       I said that this suggestion was quite impracticable.   The Britishclaims filed with the Foreign Office were all expressed in sterling and itwas well-known that the Egyptian Government would meet them out of the sterling balances at present blocked.   While it might be true, as Dr. Emaryhad argued, that the price for assets sold in Egypt would normally be fixed in Egyptian pounds and remitted at the current rate of exchange, the ownerin negotiating the price would naturally take account of this.   If we were tonegotiate a lump sum which, when converted into sterling, produced as little as  25 millions, the British claimants would ask why we had not madeallowance for the fact that the Egyptian pound was at a discount.14.      Dr. Emary pressed me not to reject this idea altogether since itmight be helpful in bridging the gap between our respective positions.15.      It was finally agreed that a further meeting should be held inSwitzerland to which I would bring with me one or two other members ofour delegation.   I would send a message to Dr. Emary fixing a date forthis meeting.   We could then discuss the question of sequestration charges and see whether an arrangement could be found which would enable Dr. Emaryto recommend that a lump sum payment of  35 millions should be made.In the meantime the negotiations with Shell should be resumed immediately.The Company have now suggested to the Egyptians that this might most conveniently be done in Geneva.-6-
APPENDIX IICOMMENTS OF DR. EMARY ON THE DRAFT AGREEMENTWITH egypt in the course of his discussions with Sir Denis Rickett, Dr. Emaryraised the following points on the draft handed to him:-(a) Article IIIHe objected to giving property owners rights under Artide V(e)to re-open tax questions in the Courts and argued that any such claimsshould be covered by the lump sum.   It was explained to him that this clauseaimed at restoring certain rights of British subjects and had nothing to do with compensation.   We recommend that this point should not be conceded.(b) Article IV (Capital ^nsfers)Dr. Emary thought that paragraph (2) should be suppressed and that capital transfers applied for before 27th July, 1956, should come within thescope of paragraph (l) so that they would qualify for an immediate releaseof  5,000.   It is, however, difficult for drafting reasons to bring pre-zerocapital transfers within the scope of paragraph (l) since the applicants forthese transfers may wish to return to Egypt.   Paragraph (2) can, however,be amended to make it clear that we expect at least  5,000 to be releasedimmediately; and we consider that Dr. Emary can be persuaded to agreeto the retention of this paragraph.As forecast in paragragraph 6(2)(b) of C.(58) 144, Dr. Emaryobjected to the exchange guarantee in paragraph (3) of this Article and statedthat the best the Egyptians could offer was non-discriminatory treatment,i. e., the rate provided for under their Exchange Control regulations.   Wedo not regard this provision as of overriding importance and suggest that sir Denis Rickett should be granted discretion to accept Dr. Emary&apos;s offerif this would lead to progress on other points of difficulty.-7-
