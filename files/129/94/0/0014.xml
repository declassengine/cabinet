(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 164 COPY NOv26th July, 1958CABINETSTATE OPENING OF PARLIAMENT;FACILITIES FOR TELEVISIONNote by the Secretary of State for the Home department and Lord Privy SealThis question has been examined by the Committeeof Ministers, under my chairmanship, which the Cabinet appointed for the purpose.   I will report orally to the Cabinet.2. I attach three appendices, prepared by the Postmaster-General, indicating the technical implications of -a) televising the ceremony;b) making a colour film;c) some alternative suggestions.R.A. B.Home Office, S.W.I.25th July, 1958CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEX ITELEVISION facilities on the assumption that television inside would be confined to the Royal Gallery and to the House of Lords Chamberthe probable technical requirements are as follows:-2. Royal Gallery(a) Three cameras each occupying, with operater,a four foot square.    They would need to be atthe top of the stands erected for those invitedto witness the Procession.   Two would be atone end of the Gallery and the other half-way along.(b) Twelve two-kilowatt lamps situated well aboveeye level to supplement the normal lighting.3. House of Lords Chamber(a) Four cameras - all in the Gallery.   One wouldb e at the Throne end, two at the other end, andone in a mid-position.   Each, with operator,would require a four foot square.(b) Twenty-four two-kilowatt lamps above theGallery.(c) A concealed microphone above the Throne if aconnection to the existing sound amplificationsystem was not adequate.4. As regards the extra lighting in both places, no glareor excessive heat should arise.   The lighting would not be comparable with that in the Abbey at the time of the Coronation.   More powerfullighting was necessary there because of the requirements of colouredcinema films made of the ceremony.5. The commentator would be located with the mobiletransmitting unit outside the building.6. Access to both the Royal Gallery and the House of LordsChamber would be required the previous day or night.CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEX IIFACILITIES FOR COLOUR FIJLMCamerasIt is estimated that three camera positions would benecessary:-(a) On a concealed platform built above the centresection of the passage-way at the back of theStrangers&apos; Gallery.   This would not interferewith the seating.(b) In the centre bay of the Peeresses&apos;Gallery on theeast side.   A structure would have to be built to enclose the bay.   A narrow slot would haveto be made to allow the camera to swivel, inorder to command views both of the Throneand seats within the well of the House.(c) In the second bay (from the north end) on the westside of the Peeresses* Gallery.   Here to a structurewould have to be built to enclose the bay and an arrow slot made to allow the camera to swivel.Each of the two bays in the Peeresses1 Galleries would have to begiven up entirely to the cameras.Lighting2. It would be necessary to replace the existing bulbs in thechandeliers with similar bulbs with silver reflectors.   These wouldgive a whiter, more intense light.   In addition it would be necessary tomount eight two-kilowatt lamps above the panelling below the windowsalong the east and west sides of the House, making a total of sixteenlamps.   It would not be possible to camouflage these to any great extent.Fourteen of the two-kilowatt lamps would be directed down and acrossthe House, the remaining two on the dais of the Throne.   All the cables would be concealed.   The overall effect of this would be toincrease the intensity of the existing lighting by about six times, toa level about the same as at the Coronation.3. The lighting requirements are, of course, only estimates.4. If permission were granted for a small colour camera tobe taken into the House on five or six occasions during the recess the lighting requirements could be more accurately assessed.    Experimentcould be made starting with the existing lights and building up the intensity by first changing thebiibs in the chandeliers and later addingsupplementary lighting by degrees.   It might be that these tests wouldreveal that less lighting was necessary than at present estimated.5. A lighting and camera rehearsal would be necessary about two weeks before the Opening of Parliament to allow time for changes to be made.-2-CONFIDENTIAL
6. Lights could be fitted with dimmers; it is suggested thatthe lights should be brought slowly up to strength starting abouteight minutes before the Queen arrives and then left on.Cost of Colour Film7. The colour film is estimated to cost about  10,000.Two-thirds of the cost should be recoverable from United Kingdomand oversea distribution; but, say, net cost estimated at  6,000.ANNEX IIIPOSSIBLE COMBINATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES(a) Colour Film and TelevisionThe camera positions and lighting would be as for acolour film.(b) Colour Film. Television and NewsreelThe conditions would be the same as for colour filmand television.   No extra lighting or room for cameras would berequired.(c) Television and Newsreel onlyThe conditions would be the same;  but the lightingcould be reduced by approximately 30 per cent, the reduction being achieved either by reducing the number of two-kilowatt lamps along the east and west Galleries or by using lights of a lesser intensity.(d) Still PhotographsIf facilities are given to either television or newsreels,the press will undoubtedly consider that they should also beallowed to take still photographs in the Chamber.   They will seekfacilities for a minimum of three, and possibly four, still cameramen.No flashes would, of course, be necessary.-3-CONFIDENTIAL
