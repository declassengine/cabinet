(this document IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY-^ GOVERNMENT)The draft White Paper on Pensions has been examined by a small body of Ministers under my chairmanship;  and the text which theMinister of Pensions has now circulated (C.(58) 189) incorporates variousamendments which we agreed.   I commend it to my colleagues as beingas clear and convincing a statement of the Governments proposals as the complex subject matter allows.2.     We also considered the desirability of making available, at thesame time, a more popular version of the White Paper, prepared by theCentral Office of Information and published by the Stationery Office.The text is appended to this memorandum.   But it is necessary to consider,before we take this step, whether it would expose us to the charge ofinfringing the established convention that public money should not be spent on official publications explaining proposals which are to be thesubject of legislation in the near future.   Precedent is deceptive in thismatter.   In 1942 the Government of the day published &quot;The beveridge report in Brief&quot;;  and in 1944 they published both &quot;The National health service: the White Paper Proposals in Brief&quot; and a popular version of&quot;The Social Insurance White Paper&quot;.   But in none of these cases wasimmediate legislation in prospect;  and each of these &quot;popular versions&quot;was designed to explain to the general public the main outlines of a schemeof relatively long-term social reform rather than to describe in detaila particular project which was to be the subject of more or less immediate legislation.   (The White Paper on the National Health Service, for example,was described by the Government as putting forward definite proposals,but not fixed decisions, &quot;for discussion in Parliament and the country&quot;;no date was given for legislation to implement these proposals, and in fact the Bill was introduced more than two years later, after the GeneralElection. )  &quot;Operation Rescue&quot; is perhaps a closer precedent.   But thatpamphlet provoked adverse criticism in Parliament on the grounds whichI have mentioned above;  and we shall clearly be liable to renewed attack of the same kind if we publish, in the interval between the party conference (when our project will first be launched in general terms)and The Queen*s Speech (which will make clear our intention to introduce a Bill), a popular version of the Pensions White Paper prepared by theCentral Office of Information.C.(58) 19123rd September, 1958CABINETPENSIONSMemorandum by the Lord chancellor
3.      Moreover, the issue is not merely &amp;n issue of principle, i. e. ,that the integrity of the Government information services should not becompromised.   It is also a tactical issue, i.e. , that we might be unwise to allow the initial impact of our proposals to be marred by the controversy,which the Opposition would certainly provoke, on this relatively trivialquestion of the method of presentation of our scheme.4.      I have, therefore, thought it desirable to invite the Cabinet toconsider whether it would be to our advantage to publish, officially, a popular version of the White Paper on the lines of the attached draft orwhether it might be better to make a special effort to secure the maximum of publicity for our proposals in the Press and by similar means.K .Lord Chancellors Department, S.W.I.23rd September, 1958
DRAFT POPULAR LEAFLETSECURITYI NOLD    AGEThe Government&apos;s Plan for a new National Pensions Scheme,
This short booklet is based on the White Paper &quot;Provisionfor Old Age - The future Development of the National InsuranceScheme&quot;.     It does not purport to contain all the material inthe White paper to which reference should be made for more detailed study and the text of the Government&apos;s proposals.1
A secure Income in Old Age .......... enough to live on during the years of retirement.     That*s something weall want.How we set about it is largely the personal responsibility of each one of us during our working lives.     Some put money aside to accumulate into aprivate nest-egg.    Others take out private insurance policies.    A growing number - more than a third of the total working population including nearly one half of the men - belong to pensions schemes connected with their jobs.But the foundation on which most of us build is the retirement pensionprovided through National Insurance.    &quot;Our aim must be to strengthen and extend this foundation.This year the National Insurance Scheme is going &quot;into the red&quot; - thecost of pensions and benefits is outstripping contribution income.     Andthe proportion of old people is growing.     Today it is one in seven;   in 1979it will be nearly one in five.     So if we go on as we are the gap between costand income - which income already includes  125 million a year from the taxpayer -will widen year by year to reach about  260 million a year in ten years1 timeand about  2*00 million in twenty years&apos; time.How is National Insurance to be put on a sound financial footing for thefuture?    And how at the same   time can the present national provision for old age be improved?     That is the problem.In putting forward their plan the Government hope to encourage public discussion on a topic vital to the national well-being.When could a new pension plan start?     It&apos;s impossible to be precise atthis stage.     A Bill id 11 have to be discussed in Parliament.     But in view ofthe reorganisation involved for everyone concerned it could not come intoeffect before April 1961.What is wrong with the -present National Insurance SchemeContributory pensions since their start in 1926 have always been a flat-rate payment in return for a flat-rate contribution.     Today the real value of the pension,  2 30s. a week for a single person and  ^ for a married couple, is higher than in any previous year.But the limitations of a flat-rate system set an important socialproblem.     The contributions - and so the benefits - must necessarily be fixed ata level which the lower paid can afford.     The speed of the convoy is kept tothat of its slowest ship.Drawing of ConvoyAnd despite their encouraging growth, occupational schemes do not cover two-thirds of the workers in industry and seem unlikely to cover nearly everybodyat any rate for some time to come.Then there is the question of cost.     The cost of national insurance pensions is shared between individual employers, individual insuredpersons and taxpayers as a whole.     Pension   rates are linked tocontributions and when pensions have been increased, as on five occasionssince the war, the contribution has also had to go up.     But the pensioner, although getting the increase, has paid no more contributions.And nearly everyone else has improved his prospective rights without paying for them in full,      A married man who with his wife today starts to draw
pensions of  4 a week can with his employer have paid at most contributionssuffioient for a pension of 6s. a week even if ha has contributed since theschema began in 1926.This is why the National Insurance Schema is running into the red this year,fcnd the number of pensioners is growing steadily while the number of contributorswill remain about the same.The national insurance scheme must be placed on a sounder footing if the conception of benefit as of right is not to be undermined.   And at the sametime something must ba dona to help those outside adequate occupational schemes to earn pensions whioh have some relation to their earnings.    Howcan all this best be achieved?A Graduated Schema is the SolutionWhat is the alternative to a flat-^rata scheme?   A system of contributions and pensions related to earnings.And to what range of earnings should graduation apply?   The Government believethat it would not ba right for the State to force everyone to contribute more fortheir old age than is reasonably necessary*   To dictate how people should otherwisespend their income during working life would undermine the individual&apos;a sense ofresponsibility for his own affairs.   Moreover an excessive extension of the state scheme could do grave damage to occupational pensions schemes.Support from the taxpayer for National InsuranceWhy is support given from general taxation for our national Insurance scheme?Because without it tha lower paid worker cannot, even with the aid of his employer, provide himself with an adequate pension.   Under a system of oontributionsgraduated according to earnings, the support from taxation could be concentratedwhere it is most needed.The Growing Importance of Occupational Pensions SchemesDuring the past twenty years more and more of us have oome to belong topensions schemes connected with our jobs.   Today their membership approaches9 million, more than one third of the working population.   And the proportion isstill growing steadily.The schemes vary considerably in rules and benefits.   But all have threefeatures in common.   They are more closely adapted to tha needs of the individual and his employment than any universal scheme can be.   They promise him an improvedstandard of living in old age.   And their invested funds help to create the realwealth on which the future standard of living of the old must depend.Occupational schemes are a national asset and nothing should be done to impedetheir continued useful growth.Tha Place of Occupational Schemes in the National SettingHow best can occupational schemes be enabled to develop alongside a new national schema?   It is generally agreed that everyone should be covered by thepresent flat rate provisions.   But with tha introduction of a State system of graduated oontributions and pensions, it is no part of the Government&apos;s polioy to force those adequately covered by an occupational scheme into the graduated partof a State scheme as well.They therefore consider there should ba an option to contract employees out ofthe graduated part of the State scheme.   But this could only be allowed if:o   the occupational schema provides everyone contracted out with pension rights at least as good as the most anyone could get under the new State schemeo  pension rights at least up to this amount are pre served when a manchanges his jobo   the occupational scheme is financially sound.Graph showing Income and Expenditure, in particularexpenditure on retirement pensions. _
THE GOVERNMENTS PLANSome of the reasons which make a change in the present scheme essential and some of the principles involved have already &quot;been outlined.The Government believe that    National Insurance must be placed, on a sound financial footing.o    A start should be made with providing workers who oarmot be covered by anadequate occupational scheme -with some measure of graduated pension related to their earnings.o    Occupational psnsions schemes must be encouraged not hampered, in their development.A graduated Pension SchemeInsttad of bhe present flat-rate contribution everyone ever 1g who is employed end not &quot;contracted out&quot; will pay contributions graduated accordingto earnings.     There will be a minimum weekly contribution for all earnings up to  9s with a percentage on all earnings from there to  15.     In fact itwill work rather like taking a taxi, with a fixed charge on the clock assoon as you start, carrying you for a certain distance, and then ticking up.This minimum contribution (shared with the employer) will be 15s. 4d. -8^- per cent of  9 - for an employed man and 13s. 6d.* for an employed woman,which will take you up to  9 a week earnings.     These minimum contributionsinclude the separate National Health Service contribution and the contribution for Industrial Injuries.     The clock will tick up on earnings above  9 a week at the rate of 8-g- per cent of earnings, divided equally between employer and employee.Compare the new contributions for men and women earning  9 a week or lesswith the present ones.Men WomenNew Present New PresentPaid by Employee 8s. 4d. 9s. lid. 7s. 7d. 8s.

ML.     18s.     2d.      13s.   6d.     14s.     9d.The rooult is that for a joint contribution of 2s. lOd. less than nowpaid men earning  9 a week or less will be entitled to all the presentpensions and benefits in full.     And so will women whose earnings are  or less for a joint contribution of Is. 3d. smaller than now.* The woman&apos;s minimum contribution is less because her National health service and Industrial Injuries contributions are lower, and hercontribution does not include payments towards the National insurance benefits for dependants.

The rules will be, as outlined on page^j that no employee contracted out can as a result get lesspension than he would have got if he paid maximum contributions to the state scheme, whether he later changes his job or not. These employees and their employers will continue to pay the present contributions for the time being,which will qualify them for the present flat-rate pensions and benefits.How the Taxpayer will support National Insurance under the New PlanEach year  170 million will be paid by the taxpayer to the new scheme.   Thisis rather more than one quarter of the income from the minimum contributions.And it includes the same amount of support from the taxpayer for the contributions of the self-employed and the non-employed as at present.The taxpayer&apos;s support for the Industrial Injuries scheme will also continueunchanged.   So for employees, taxation will provide towards National Insurance atotal sum equal to about 2 per cent of weekly earnings of  9.The Graduated PensionHow much will the graduated pension be?   Each person1s pension will depend onthe total of graduated contributions he has paid since the start of this new scheme.The graduated pension will be built up shilling by shilling, each bought for so many &quot;units of contribution&quot;.   A  1 of graduated contribution paid by the employee, whatever hio age when it is paid, will, with the matching  1 from the employer, count as a unit.   For a man fifteen units will add one shilling a week - 2   12s. a year - to the standard retirement pension of  2   10s. a week if he issingle and  4 if he in married.   A woman will need 18 units for each extrashilling on her pension, because she can draw it five years sooner than a man andis likely to go on drawing it to a greater age.Like the flat-rate pension, the graduated pension will be paid, subject toretirement and an earnings rule, at the ages of 65 for men and 60 for women or later, and in any case regardless of retirement and the amount of earnings fromthe ages of 70 for men and 65 for women.   Those in the graduated scheme who putoff their retirement beyond the minimum age, will earn bigger graduated pensions.
The present system of flat-rate widows benefits for widows under 60will continue.     But the widow of a man who has been paying graduated contributions will get on retirement an addition to her retirement pension equal to half the additional pension which her husband was drawingor had earned whilst alive.     This will be on top of any graduated pension3he has herself earned.Examples of the graduated pensions for people with different earnings and starting to contribute at different ages are given on the middle pa es.How the New Flan will work for people-of various agesan^at different levels of earningsif tj   wLevel ofWeeklyEarnings 10 12 14 15TotalWeeklyContribution17s.20s. 43.23s.10d.25s. 6a.Age atEntry30425057Total Weekly retirement pension at 65Single Men   Married Men 2 15s. 3 3 1s. 2 17s. 4 5s. 4 10s. 4 11s. 4 7s.WOMEN 10 12 1515s. 2d.18s. 6d.23s. 8d.304054Total Weekly retirement pension at 60_ 2   13s. 2   17s. 2   14s.The Self-Employed, the Non-Employed and JuvenilesThe Government consider that graduation should not apply to the self-employed.     They have no employer with whom to share a pension contribution,but they are now able to provide for their own old age with similar taxreliefs to those given to the employed who belong to occupational pension schemes.The self-employed, the non-employed and juveniles will not be affectedby the new scheme.     Their contributions v/ill remain at the present ratesfor the time being.Married WomenThey will be able, as at present, to choose not to pay their own shareof the miniiiium or flat-rate contributions, other than Industrial Injuriescontributions.     But those earning above  9 a week - unless contracted out as members of an occupational pension scheme - will have to pay their shareof the graduated contribution on their earnings between  9 and  15a week.And of course thoy will get graduated pension for these contributions onthe some terms as single women in addition to any pension from their husband1or their own insurance..6
National Insurance Must be Made Financially Sound Now and for the FutureWe saw earlier that the growing deficits of the National insurance fund are due to the award of full pensions to those who cannot have contributed enough to pay for them   and to the growing proportion of old people.    We must, therefore, build into the new National Insurancestructure now safeguards against future financial instability.   *Under the new system, the income from contributions will rise as national earnings rise.    But this rise in income will lag behind therapidly rising cost of pensions.    So contributions will have to beincreased at five yearly intervals within the first twenty years.These increases in the graduated contributions of both employees and employers, to meet the rising cost of pensions, will be ? per cent aside of earnings between  9 and  15a week.    This means each increase will range between 5d. a side on the minimum contribution and 9d. a sideon the maximum contribution.     Comparable increases will also be made inthe minimum contributions and in the flat-rate contributions for the self-employed, the non-employed and those contracted out.These five yearly increases in contributions have been kept as smallas possible and as a result will to begin with eliminate the gap betweenincome and cost in some years but not in all.    By the end of twenty years the yearly accounts will be showing a surplus.Below is a forecast to illustrate how the ever-widening gap under thepresent scheme can be brought under control by the New Plan.Security in old age is something we all want.     But only by acalculated measure of self-denial during our working years can we create the resources to achieve it.
