(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 185COPY NO. (n Q9th September, 1958CABINETTERRITORIAL, V7ATERSNote by the Minister of State for Foreign affairs attach a p:-.-..^ prepared by officials containingrecommendations on the policy to be adopted when the forthcoming session of the Unitc-i Nations General Assembly discusses theproposed second Conference on the Law of the Sea.2.        These recommendations represent agreed views at theofficial level by the Departments concerned with this problem.I endorse them, and if the Cabinet agree, would propose to instruct the United Kingdom Delegation at the United Nationsaccordingly.   As these recommendations are in line with what we understand to be the United States views, we could, once thisis confirmed, concert tactics with the State Department,particularly on securing the maximum support in advance for thispolicy.A.N.Foreign Office, S.W.1.9th September, 1958
LAW OP THE SEAThe Cabinet meeting of July 22 invited the Secretary of State, in consultation withother Ministers, to obtain the views of theGovernments of the United States and theCommonwealth countries on the holding of asecond   Conference on the Law of the Sea tosettle matters outstanding from the    geneva conference.We have now received views from thefollowing   Commonwealth countries:   Canada,Australia, New Zealand, India, Pakistan andGhana.    Tentative and informal views havealso been obtained from the United StatesState Department.As the United Nations   General   Assemblyopens on September 16, it does not seem thatwe can afford to wait for further or moreauthoritative views before reaching a firm UnitedKingdom position, for which we would seek themaximum support in advance of United Nationsdiscussion.The views received on the various issues involved are set out below:-(a)   Holding of the conference the United States, Canada, Australia,New Zealand, India, Pakistan and Ghanaare in favour of holding a further conference.(b)/
(b) Scope of the conference the United States, Canada, Australia,New Zealand, Pakistan and   Ghana favourconsideration of both the breadth of theterritorial sea and exclusive fisheryrights.   Other countries have not expressed a view on this point.(c) Timing of the conference the United   States,   Canada, Australia,New Zealand, Pakistan and   Ghana favour the convening of the Conference as soonas possible.     We gather that this meanssometime in 1959* probably early summer.India favours a delay until perhaps 1960.(d) A possible   General   Assembly resolution calling upon members to refrain from making unilateral claims pending further&apos; international action the United States do not favour a resolution in these terms.     Canada, Australia, NowZealand and   Ghana agree to the proposal.The Pakistanis have not made up their mind.(e) A   General Assembly resolution proposingregional agreements on fisheries.This is not welcomed by the United States orby Canada or Ghana.   Australia and NewZealand would support such a resolution.Other countries have not expressed theiropinions, although the Indians have statedthat thoy have no special interest inexclusive fishery rights.It is submitted that the following line should
be taken by the United kingdom delegation at the United nations general Assembly in regard to theproposed second Conference on the law of the Sea:-*(a) Holding; of the conference it is generally in the longterm interests of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment that the secondconference should be held,and it is therefore recommendedthat our delegation should support this.(b) Scope of the- conference the Cabinet on July 22, reached no final conclusion on this point, butdecided that the views of the friendlycountries should be sought - without committing Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentfinally - on the question whetherthe United Nations General assembly should adopt a resolution limiting the next conference to the breadth of territorial waters and recommend-ing Member States to negotiatefishery agreements among themselves.It is recommended that theUnited Kingdom Delegation should support a resolution in favour ofa conference dealing with both the breadth of territorial waters andfishery limits, but nothing else,for/
for the following reasons:-(i) The tv/o issues were dealt withtogether at the   Geneva   Conferenceon the Law of the   Sea, aid it islogical on the face of it that thenext conference should tackle themtogether.(ii) Soundings so far indicate that a&quot;package &quot; conference would he likelyto attract more support than one concerned only with territorial limits.   Indeed,it seems that to obtain general acceptanceof the latter and a reasonable outcome of the ensueing Conference, it v/ould be necessary to assure States with fisheryambitions that their reasonable needsv/ould be satisfied in another way, i.e.in bilateral or multilateral negotiations.This would mean under-the-counterpromisos in New York or (even moreundesirable) submitting, to a discussionof the substance of fishery claims bythe General Assembly,(iii)     We do not want the Conference togo outside theso two questions becauseof the danger that matters settled at the Geneva Conference may be . .reopened or other awkward questionsmay be brought up.   The United States,support this view.If any further item is proposed for theagenda, it is recommended that the UnitedKingdom Delegation should refer for instructions
c) A possible Assembly resolutionrecommending Member States tonegotiate fishery agreementsamong themselves.This would not be free from danger in the context of United Kingdom/Iceland relations.     A resolution infavour of regional agreements v/ouldcome up against the difficulty ofdefining regions.    It is also possible that a regional agreementbetween, say, certain South american countries on the basis of what wewould regard as exaggerated limitscould be used as a damaging precedent for other regions.     A resolution infavour of bilateral negotiations would involve the difficultiesoutlined in (ii) above.     The absenceof a resolution on the subject willnot of course prevent us fromnegotiating such agreements if itappears possible and useful to do so.It is therefore recommended that theUnited Kingdom Delegation do not support such a proposal.d) Timing of the conference the sooner the next conference is held, the greater will be thepossibility of obviating furtherunilateral claims to increasedterritorial waters.   This is particular!important in the context zt Iceland.In/
In addition, the results of bilateral ormultilateral negotiations on fishery limitsmight tend to prejudice the chances ofadoption of a reasonable figure forterritorial waters limits.   But some timefor diplomatic preparation   is also desirable.On the whole, a conference in the summer of1959 v/ould be preferable.    It is therefore recommended that the United Kingdom delegation should work for a conference in the summer of 1959.     The Delegation should howeverbear in mind that the Conference cannot beheld simultaneously with the annual meetingof the International Law Commission, as bothare served by the same sections of the secretariat.A possible General Assembly resolution calling upon Members to refrain from making unilateral claims.Such a Resolution might have a usefulmoral affect, and would be in line withthe efforts made by Her Majesty&apos;s government before the Geneva   Conference on the law of the Sea in urging other Governments to refrain from unilateral declarations inadvance of international discussions.   Sucha Resolution might also have some affectwith Iceland in any further discussions.   Thevalue of the Resolution would, however,largely depend on whether or not the secondconference is held at an early date.    Itmight also give the impression of forcing theissue and thus antagonize other Governments whosesupport/
support would be needed at theGeneral Assembly and the ensuingConference.    It is therefore recommendedthat the United Kingdom Delegationwhile working for the adoption ofsuch a resolution, should not insist on it if this appears likely to endanger their efforts as a whole.    Inany case the Delegation should not themselves table any such Resolution.Place of the ConferenceProm the United Nations pointof view for financial reasons themost suitable place of meeting wouldbe New York.    But the Latin- Americanvoice will be even louder in New Yorkthan it was at   Geneva.      The latter would also be less difficultmechanically than it was last time,as there would virtually be no maincommittees.      Geneva has some advantagesfrom the United Kingdom point of view.It is recommended that the UnitedKingdom   Delegation should express a preference for   Geneva, but acceptwhatever appears to be the majorityview.    The Secretariat for theInternational Law Commission (see endof (b) above) will already be in geneva from April to the end of Junefor the    Commission&apos;s meeting and aConference could therefore veryconveniently be held in Geneva inJuly/
July (but not in March-April as a.legalConference on Statelessrtess is already scheduledthere about that time).This submission does not seek to prejudge the line to be taken by the United kingdom representatives at any future   Conference.    Itis proposed, after ascertaining the viewsof Commonwealth and other friendly Governments, tomake further recommendations on this subject.
