C.(58) 197 COPY NO.  ^\26th September, 1958CABINETSOCIAL INVESTMENT:  education memorandum by the Minister of education in his paper C. (58) 196 the Financial Secretary to the Treasurypoints out thattto make a cut of as much as  5. 3 millions in the invest-ment programme which I have proposed for 1960/61, it would be necessaryto restrict starts in that year to the 1959/60 level for all major and minor projects except those for teacher training.2.        Such a restriction is quite incompatible with the policy of advance in education which we have been discussing for some months.3.        The 1959/60 programme of  46 millions starts for primary and secondary schools is already substantially below the level of starts in earlier years up to and including the current year.    The figures areas follows:-  millions work started1956/57 1957/58 1958/59 * 1959/60*58. 0 54.0 51.0 46.0x   authorised to start4.        In compiling the 1959/60 programme, I have had to reject alarge volume of thoroughly justified projects.    The diversion of resources from &quot;bulge11 to &quot;improvements&quot; projects which would be possible withina continuing programme of  46 millions would not have any significant effort in 1960/61;  it would mainly take place in the latter part of the4-5 year period ending in 1965.    No Minister of Education could talk about an advance in education while restricting school building in 1960/61 asseverely as I have had to do in drawing up the 1959/60 programme.    to launch a convincing forward drive the size of the 1960/61 programme mustbe, and must be seen to be, significantly greater than the 1958/59 figureof  51 millions in terms of starts.5.        Minor works are just as important.    In 1957/58 we had 16 millions, including school meals.    This year, I have been cut to 12 millions (including  1 million specially allocated to ease unemploy-ment).    Next year, I am still authorised to approve only  12 millions &apos;worth.    Apart from  1 million for long overdue improvements indining conditions in the schools (without which we should have trouble with the teachers as well as the local authorities) this allows nothing(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAIESTY,S GOVERNMENT)
for improvements as distinct from additional urgently needed places.    Itwould be farcical to pretend to be launching a drive in education whilerestricting these minor works below last year&apos;s level of  16 millions.6.        If we are to present a forward policy in education, the onlymeasure I can take to reduce investment in 1960/61 is to cut back theproposed level of starts for primary and secondary schools in 1960/61from  60 millions to  55 millions.    This would reduce work done by 1 million in 1960/61.7.        A programme of  55 millions of starts for primary and secondary schools in 1960/61 could form the basis of a reasonable forwardpolicy, provided that it could be presented as the first year of a fiveyear programme.    As I showed in C. (58) 148, we need a five year school building programme of over  300 millions to sustain a policy of maximumeffort in making a reality of secondary education for all.8.        Accordingly, I ask my colleagues:-(a) to confirm that we should launch this autumn,initially by means of a White Paper, a five year programme of educational advance;(b) to agree that total educational investment in 1960/61in England and Wales should be  90. 8 millions ofwork done.    This will allow the start of 55 millions of work for primary and secondary schools in the same year;(c) to invite the Education Ministers to discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer the level of invest-ment to be announced in the White Paper for thefive year programme as a whole.G.L.Ministry of Education, W.l.26th September, 1958.
