(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0 C.(58) 177 COPY NO. U- r\1st September, 1958 CABINETSALARIES OF SCOTTISH TEACHERSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i have to inform my colleagues that, following arbitration proceedings,the National Joint Council to deal with salaries of teachers in Scotlandhave recommended to me a five per cent increase in the basic salaries of Scottish teachers because of the rise in the cost of living since the lastsettlement in November, 1956.   This memorandum considers the actionto be taken on the recommendation.2.        The early steps in the present negotiations were outlined in paper C. (58) 125, submitted jointly by the Minister of Education and myself.As was then agreed, (C.C.(58) 49th Conclusions, Minute 3), there was included in the letter sent to both sides of the National Joint Council astatement that in my opinion no major change in circumstances had arisensince the present salary scales came into effect, so that any claim for anincrease would appropriately fall to be considered in the course of the next general review, the discussions in connection with which were due to begin in the autumn.   Strong exception was taken to this statement by the Council,particularly by the teachers, who said that it prejudged the issue andundermined the whole status of the Council.3.        At the same time the authorities&apos; side offered an increase of3^ per cent compared with the teachers&apos; claim for 7 per cent.   This offer was rejected by the teachers&apos; side and the issue was taken to arbitration.On 5th August the panel of three independent arbiters   found &quot;.......thatin view of the material change of circumstances brought about by the risein cost of living since the coming into force of the Teachers&apos; Salaries(Scotland) Regulations, 1956, there should be an increase in the basicsalaries of teachers in Scotland, whose salaries are governed by the saidregulations, of 5 per cent. &quot; As previously agreed by the two sides, this findingof the arbiters became the recommendation of the Council to me.4.        I have now to decide whether to accept, reject or modify therecommendation.   If it is accepted or modified my decision will be embodied in provisional regulations which the teachers will naturally want to comeinto effect at the earliest possible date, say 1st October, since retrospectioncannot be granted.5.        The cost of a 5 per cent increase in Scotland would be  1. 5 millions over a full year, of which the Exchequer would bear  900,000.    The stateof the Education (Scotland) Fund would enable me to meet an exchequer contribution of  450,000 for the half year from 1st October without a supplementary estimate.-1-
6.        It does not seem to be practical politics to reject the recommendationoutright: there can be no question that it is based on a process of independentarbitration in the accepted sense of the term.   The National Joint councils formally approved under Section 79(2) of the Education (Scotland) Act, 1946,as the body responsible for making recommendations to the Secretary ofState regarding the salaries of teachers, and its constitution provides forthe arbitration procedure to which recourse has been had on the present occasion.   The Secretary of State has never rejected an arbitration award -or indeed any major recommendation of the Council - and to do the formerwould seem to be contrary to the Governments expressed policy ofupholding the prestige of arbit ration proceedings.    Moreover, it is well-known that there is not in fact a &quot;standstill&quot; in pay in the public sector.Civil Service increases have been awarded in the last year or so and theauthorities&apos; representatives at any rate will know that the Governmentwere prepared to accept, if necessary, a 3 per cent increase for Police,who had their last increase in February, 1957.   Although an award of5 per cent would be somewhat higher than these made in other fields thisyear, it should be pointed out that it relates to the rise in the cost ofliving since 1st November, 1956, and therefore covers a period of almosttwo years.   Indeed, although the arbiters mentioned the rise in the costof living since the present salaries regulations came into operation(i.e. 1st November, 1956), the teachers based their claim on the risesince the agreement which was embodied in these regulations was reached in the Council in July, 1956.7.        In the particular context of Scottish education, rejection of therecommendation would undoubtedly have most serious consequences.   Detailsof the arbiters&apos; award and the negotiations leading up to it have recentlybeen made public in the Teachers&apos; Journal and in the Press.   Rejection would undoubtedly mean at the very least a grave loss of confidence in the negotiation machinery, which normally functions well, and possibly acomplete breakdown of the whole machinery and the winding up of theNational Joint Council itself.    Moreover, in the context of the serious and growing shortage of teachers in Scotland and the urgent need to makethe teaching profession more attractive for recruitment purposes, it isessential   that we should be able, in a time of acute staffing difficulties,to rely on the good will of the teachers.8.        These considerations apply with almost equal force to thepossibility that I might modify the recommendation, as regards either theamount or the timing of an award.   To depart from the arbitration findingeven to the extent of granting an increase of, say, 4 per cent, would be almost as difficult as to reject it outright.   Nor do I favour deferring an award forany length of time. I am aware that an increase given now to Scottish teachersmight well encourage the teachers in England to ask for a similar increase from the same date.   But to defer any award in Scotland until, say, next april would equally lay the Government open to the same charge of refusing to honour the processes of arbitration, and it would be difficult to justifyaccepting the finding of the arbiters that there should be an increase dueto the rise in the cost of living, while at the same time postponing theactual award for six months.   Moreover, it would almost certainly become evident to the Scottish teachers that the postponement of their arbitration award was due at least in part to the position in England, with consequentexacerbation of feelings.-2-
9.        I do, of course, fully realise the force of the arguments against taking any action which might disturb the present pattern of wage settelements:but it could hardly be maintained that a 5 per cent increase covering twoyears would do so.   Moreover, I feel that to reject the increase or even to modify or delay it would be represented as the first sign of a change inthe Governments policy towards arbitration in wage negotiations:  and the repercussions of this, not only among Scottish teachers, serious though these would be, but in the industrial world generally, might well be more damaging than would those of implementing the award.   To give effectto the increase recommended would admittedly mean withdrawing from whatwas said in the letters sent to the Council.   But it could be made clearthat the recommendation had been accepted because of the arbitration award and, with a view to minimising possible repercussions, that theincrease covered a period of two years.   I would also stand on the fact of the increase to ensure that no advance takes place in the effective dateof the next general revision of salaries, the accepted date for which isApril, 1960.10.       I accordingly ask my colleagues to agree to my implementingfrom 1st October the arbitration award and consequent National joint council&apos;s recommendation for a 5 per cent increase in the basic salaries of teachers in Scotland.J.S.M.Scottish Office, S.
