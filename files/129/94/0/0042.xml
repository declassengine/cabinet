secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1958C. (58) 19224th September, 1958CABINETTHE FORMOSA STRAITSNote by the Minister of State for Foreign AffairsThe Prime Minister has suggested that the Cabinet would find it useful to have for their background information a short historical paper relating developmentsover the offshore islands since 1950.I accordingly circulate a paper which takes account of developments up to date.D. 0.-G.Foreign Office, S.W.1,23rd September, 1958.History of the Offshore Islands QuestionCommunist attempts to take Quemoy in 1949 and 1950 were defeated by the nationalists and the two sides contented themselves with exchanging artillery fire from time to time.2. On 27th June, 1950, at the time of the invasion of South Korea, thePresident of the United States (Mr. Truman) made a declaration which, among other things, said that the 7th Fleet had been instructed to protect Formosa but ithad also been told to ensure that there were no attacks from Formosa on the mainland. This decision remained substantially unchanged until 1953, when, withthe advent of the Republican Administration, President Eisenhower on 2nd February declared that the 7th Fleet would no longer &quot; be employed to shieldCommunist China.&quot; In the House of Commons on 3rd February, 1953, the thenForeign Secretary (Sir Anthony Eden) announced that Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenthad made known their concern at this decision, which, they feared, would have unfortunate political repercussions without compensating military advantages.3. Although spasmodic exchanges of fire between the mainland and theoffshore islands continued, the situation remained more or less quiet until theautumn of 1954 when it appeared that the Chinese Communists were preparing to attack Quemoy. The United States Secretary of State (Mr. Dulles) discussed thesituation at length with the Foreign Secretary in September 1954; he made it clearthat there was considerable pressure in Washington in favour of committing UnitedStates forces to help the Chinese Nationalists to hold the offshore islands. This wasnot because of their intrinsic importance but because of the effect on morale inFormosa of withdrawal from the offshore islands. At this meeting Mr. Dullesthrew out a personal suggestion that the question might be brought before theSecurity Council, with the object of Securing the neutralisation of the islands.4. Following on this conversation discussions were held with the american and other Governments with a view to preparing an approach to the security council, and the text of a resolution to be tabled by the New Zealand Government(calling on China and the Nationalists to cease hostilities) was prepared.  BeforeCopy No.8454073
this could be acted on, however, the Americans felt that they must clear their action with the Nationalists; the result of the approach to the Nationalists was unhelpful.General Chiang Kai-shek demanded at least a mutual defence treaty with theUnited States as his price. The Americans agreed to this and Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment then felt that the proposed approach in the Security Council couldnot be made until after the Americans had announced their proposed treaty since otherwise there would be charges of bad faith. Mr. Dulles agreed with this and theSecurity Council exercise was therefore postponed.5. The United States Government then made clear that it was prepared touse its armed forces to protect Formosa by concluding on 2nd December, 1954,a Mutual Security Treaty with the Nationalists. This was directed against threatsto the security of the area from armed attack and it was agreed that the use of force should be a matter of joint agreement, subject to action of an emergencycharacter which was clearly an exercise of the inherent right of self-defence.&quot; the then Chinese Communist Foreign Minister, Mr. Chou En-lai, referred to the treaty as a &quot; grave, war-like provocation &quot; and reiterated (on 23rd December, 1954) theChinese Communist position: &quot; Formosa belongs to China, and we will brook noAmerican interference in our determination to liberate it. Neither the united nations nor any other neutral body can ever be permitted to take over Formosa.&quot;6. Communist threats against and attacks on the offshore islands continued and finally, in January 1955, Mr. Dulles informed us that the United States had decided that they must persuade the Nationalists to evacuate the Tachen islands.(In the face of unfavourable United Kingdom reactions, Mr. Dulles abandoned anidea of guaranteeing Quemoy as a quid pro quo.)7. On 29th January, 1955, the Congress of the United States authorised thePresident to &quot; employ the armed forces of the United States as he deems necessaryfor the specific purpose of securing and protecting Formosa and the Pescadores(a group of islands some 20 miles West of Formosa) against armed attack, this authority to. include the securing and protection of such related positions and territories of that area now in friendly hands and the taking of such other measures as he judges to be required or appropriate in assuring the defence of Formosaand the Pescadores.&quot; This left to the President the decision as to whether the UnitedStates should take military action to defend Quemoy and Matsu, or other offshoreislands, apart from the Tachens.8. Immediately after this, and while the evacuation of the Tachens was not complete, it was decided to proceed with the proposed New Zealand initiative inthe Security Council. Accordingly Her Majesty&apos;s Representative in Pekingapproached the Chinese in this connection. In spite of efforts to persuade them toattend a meeting of the Security Council at which the situation would be discussed,the Chinese refused to attend. There seemed little point in taking the matter anyfurther in the Security Council and the Russians put forward a suggestion for aspecial conference in Shanghai or New Delhi to be summoned by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the Soviet and Indian Governments, and consisting of the UnitedStates, the United Kingdom, USSR, China, France, India, Burma, Pakistan, ceylon and Indonesia. This proposal was not accepted nor was it seriously pressed.9. In February 1955 the President sent Sir Winston Churchill a privatemessage about the offshore islands in which he said that to abandon the islands would destroy Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s resolution; General Eisenhower added that he feltthat the Chinese Nationalists must have certain assurances about the offshore islandsless binding than the Sino-American Mutual Security Treaty. In reply Sir Winstonon 15th February, 1955, sent a long message in which he used the phrase &quot; a war tokeep the coastal islands for Chiang would not be defensible here.&quot; president eisenhower replied on 19th February with a plea to Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentto trust the United States in the area, and to accept the desire of the United states on the one hand to avoid war and on the other hand to preserve thenon-Communist position.10. Sir Anthony Eden had stated Her Majesty&apos;s Governments view on thelegal position in the House on 4th February when he said that, unlike Formosaand the Pescadores, the status of which was undetermined, the offshore islandsformed part of the territory of China. Any attempt on the part of the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government to assert its authority by force would, however, in thecircumstances peculiar to the case, give rise to a situation endangering peace and security, which was properly a matter of international concern.
11. A conversation that Sir Anthony Eden had with Mr. Dulles in Bangkokdisquieted him about the position and he made an approach to the ChineseGovernment asking whether they would give some assurance that they would notprosecute their claim to Formosa by force, indicating in return that the UnitedStates might be ready to press the Nationalists to evacuate the offshore islands.Sir Anthony Eden also suggested that he might meet Mr. Chou En-lai in HongKong or elsewhere. Mr. Chou En-lai totally rejected this approach, saying thatit was a &quot; dirty deal,&quot; and that the Chinese had a right not only to the offshoreislands but also to Formosa. The Foreign Secretary therefore made a statement in the House on his return (8th March, 1955) in which he expressed the hope thatthe Chinese Government would not attack the offshore islands nor prosecute their claim to Formosa and the Pescadores by force. Sir Anthony Eden also said thathe hoped the Chinese Nationalists would withdraw their armed forces from the coastal islands and would equally agree not to prosecute their claims (to the mainland) by force.12. In April 1955 Mr. Chou En-lai made a speech at Bandung indicatingwillingness to negotiate. This was really no advance on previous positions, since he did not indicate the willingness of the Chinese Government to sit down with the nationalists, but Mr. Dulles asked Her Majesty&apos;s Government to test Chineseintentions. Accordingly Her Majesty&apos;s Representative in Peking sought an interview with Mr. Chou En-lai to find out what the latter had meant in hisBandung statement. Meanwhile, Mr. Dulles had said that negotiations could takeplace between the Chinese and United States Governments without chiang kai-shek -shek being present, although he added that the United States would not&quot; departfrom the path of fidelity and honour &quot; towards the Nationalists. He proposed thatthe subject of the discussions should be a cease-fire. In reply Mr. Chou En-laisaid that the Chinese considered that the main topic in negotiations between theUnited States and China should be the easing and removal of tension in the Formosaarea. The Chinese would be prepared to negotiate with &quot; the Chiang Kai-shekclique &quot; but this was an internal matter and should not be mixed up with theinternational negotiations.13. In the meantime, also in April 1955, the United States senttwo representatives, Admiral Radford and Mr. Robertson, to Formosa to try to persuade the Nationalists to evacuate the offshore islands. In this mission theycompletely failed.14. The Sino-American talks finally began in Geneva at Ambassadorial levelon 1st August, 1955. The Americans came to the talks with the aim of securing agreement to the mutual and reciprocal renunciation of force in the Formosa Straits,while the Chinese aim was to secure American withdrawal from the area. (In fact,the first question to be discussed was that of American citizens imprisoned in Chinaand Chinese students and others in the United States, but his matter need not beconsidered here.)15. Early attempts to reach an agreed formula on the renunciation of forceended by the Chinese rejection, in a public statement on 18th January, 1956, of an american proposal which would have made renunciation of force &quot; especiallyapplicable to the Formosa area &quot; and qualified it by the words &quot; without prejudice to the inherent rights of individual and collective self-defence.&quot; The Chinese claimed that by these proposals the United States was asking acceptance of &quot; continuedoccupation &quot; of Formosa by the United States and the maintenance &quot; for ever &quot; of tension in the Formosa area. At the same time the Chinese reiterated their intentionto &apos;; liberate &quot; Formosa as a sovereign right and an internal affair.16. The question of the renunciation of force has continued since then as amain topic of discussion. Given the basic position of the two parlies that theChinese Government regard Formosa and the offshore islands as Chinese territory which they have a right to occupy by whatever means they deem desirable, and thaton Formosa the United States stand committed to the Nationalist regime, whosedetermination to reconquer the mainland has been repeatedly declared, and who (atleast publicly) therefore regard the offshore islands as a beach-head real progress towards an agreed formula applicable to the situation in the Formosa Straits has never been achieved. Throughout the talks the Chinese have refused to renouncethe use of force unless first conceded the goals for which they would use force.17. When, at the end of 1957, the American representative (Mr. Johnson,Ambassador to Czechoslovakia) received a new appointment the Chinese refused to
meet; the official who was designated to deputise for him, as he was not ofambassadorial rank. The talks, thereupon lapsed. On 30th June, 195&amp;, the Chineseissued a statement that, unless the Americans acted within fifteen days to appoint an Ambassador, they would consider that the United States had decided to break off the talks. They were, they said, strong enough to &quot; liberate &quot;Formosa and noforce on earth could stop them, Mr. Dulles declared on 1st July that arrangements were in hand for appointing a new Ambassador, but that the United States did not intend to be bound, by the Chinese deadline. On 28th July the Chineserepresentative (their Ambassador to Poland, Mr. Wang Ping-nan) was informed bythe acting American representative that Mr. Jacob Beam, United states ambassador to Poland, had been appointed to continue the talks.18. During the last few years the Nationalists have so reinforced their troops on the offshore islands that some are now heavily garrisoned. It is understood thatthere are now between 70,000 and 100,000 men on Quemoy and Little Quemoy.19. At the time of the outbreak of the present Chinese Communist actionagainst Quemoy on 23rd August the general situation was, therefore, that the declared intentions of the Chinese Government towards Formosa, the Pescadoresand the offshore islands remained unchanged; that the Nationalists were much stronger in the offshore islands than they were in 1955; that the United States had attempted, unsuccessfully, to secure a renunciation by the Chinese Government ofthe use of force in the Formosa area, and that they were committed to theNationalist regime by the Mutual Security Treaty. At the same time the president was armed with the powers provided by the Congressional resolution of 1955.20. A further complicating factor in the local situation arose when theChinese on 4th September announced their claim to a 12-mile territorial waterlimit. Since then Peking radio has broadcast a series of protests and warningsagainst the intrusion of United States naval forces into Chinese territorial waterswhen convoying Nationalist supply ships. (United States warships stay outsidethe three-mile limit from Quemoy but thereby are, of course, within the 12-mile limit which the Chinese now claim.) There have also been protests against allegedUnited States reconnaissance flights over the mainland and (12-mile) territorial waters.21. When, in answer to Mr. Dulles&apos; statement of 4th September, Mr. ChouEn-lai said on 6th September that, in spite of the fact that the United States had&quot; crudely violated minimum codes in international relations,&quot; the Chinese Govern-ment proposed to sit down to negotiate with them in seeking relaxation andelimination of tension in the area,.the White House immediately announced the willingness of the United States to resume negotiations at once on issues affecting theFormosa Straits and the islands of Quemoy and Matsu. Accordingly the Ambassadors-dorial talks were resumed in Warsaw between Mr. Jacob Beam and Mr. WangPing-nan on 15th September. Mr. Dulles has told the Foreign Secretary that at thismeeting an agreed announcement was proposed by the Chinese representative whichwould require the United States to withdraw its armed forces from Formosa, thePescadores and the Formosa Straits; would undertake that Nationalist forceswithdrawing from the offshore islands should not be pursued; and would declarethe intention of the Chinese Government to &quot; liberate&quot; Formosa and thePescadores, whilst avoiding for a &quot; certain period of time &quot; the use of force for thatpurpose. The State Department has informed us that no progress was made at thesecond meeting, held on 18th September, and according to Press reports the thirdmeeting, which was due to be held on 21st September, was postponed until22nd September.22. The Soviet Union&apos;s attitude to the dispute was made known on 7th September when Mr. Khrushchev addressed a message to President Eisenhower,calling for the withdrawal of all United States forces from the area and saying that&quot; an attack on China is an attack on the Soviet Union.&quot; President Eisenhowerreplied on 12th September expressing regret that the Soviet Union had so far made no effort to exert a moderating influence on the situation and suggesting thatMr. Khrushchev should urge restraint on the Chinese. On 19th SeptemberMr. Khrushchev replied in a further letter, couched in uncompromising andoffensive terms. The White House declared the letter to be unacceptable and theUnited States Charge d&apos;Affaires was instructed to return it to the SovietGovernment.September, 1958.
