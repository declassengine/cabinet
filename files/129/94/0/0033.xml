secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. September 1958C. (58) 183 Copy No.9th September, 1958CABINETAGRICULTURE AND THE FREE TRADE area memorandum by the Paymaster general  am circulating with this:  (1) a paper setting out a formula relating to our production policy, whichmight be used in the Free Trade Area negotiations and which, at therequest of the Prime Ministers Committee, I have prepared inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Agriculture (Annex A);(2) a paper by officials on the proposals of the Six for an AgriculturalAgreement, which were conveyed to us at a date subsequent to themeeting of the Prime Ministers Committee (Annex B).I need the guidance of my colleagues on the method of handling these problems,both at the Montreal Conference and at the subsequent stage of the Free trade area negotiations.An Agricultural Agreement2. Our initial attitude, to which we are publicly committed, was thatagriculture should not be included in any Free Trade Area. It rapidly became apparent that there could be no question of a Free Trade Area unless somethingwere done about agriculture. We have endeavoured to solve this problemconsistently with our pledges by proposing that, simultaneously with the free trade Area, there should be negotiated a new Agricultural Agreement dealing with trade in agricultural products. The purpose of this agreement would be topromote freer and fairer trade in Europe through the concerting of nationalagricultural policies.3. We have made it clear that such an agreement would be acceptable tous only if it is consistent with:  (a) Our commitments to support home agriculture.   This implies:  (i) that for the guaranteed commodities nothing should undermine theworking of the 1957 Act;(ii) that for those commodities, principally horticultural, where thetariff takes the place of the price guarantee system, there shouldbe an equivalent measure of protection maintained (though weshould not claim a greater level of protection than for the guaranteed commodities).(b) Our commitments to the Commonwealth, which we have expressed as anundertaking to maintain their full position in the United kingdom market for foodstuffs, drink and tobacco.   This means:  (i) maintaining the open door for their products;(ii) maintaining their preferential margins where Commonwealthproducts compete with European products.54011a
4. We must, therefore, examine the proposals of the Six in the light of these commitments. I believe myself that the Six have made a clear effort to meet us.In Annex B officials have rightly stressed all the difficulties, but we should not under-estimate the advance that this paper represents. From the point of viewof the European countries, it must not be forgotten that the obligations to reduceall barriers to trade in industrial products will be both complete and automatic,and, as we have recognised, those countries who have a large interest in agriculturalexports can reasonably claim some quid pro quo for this opening of their marketsto our industrial products.The Proposals of the Six5.  There seem to me to be three features which are encouraging.(i) The Six accept the idea of a separate agreement for agriculture: someof them have their political and parliamentary difficulties in thesematters, which tend to be the opposite of ours, and their acceptance ofa separate agricultural agreement cannot have been without some difficulty.(ii) They accept our ideas about the system of confrontation of policies.(iii) Their proposals for the treatment of price support policies in the initialstage of the Agricultural Agreement seem to me acceptable to us.This is a substantial improvement upon the previous position.6. On the other hand there are three features in their proposals that areobjectionable to us. They are:  (i) the proposal to link the development of the Agricultural Agreement stageby stage with the development of the Free Trade Area;(ii) the specific proposals relating to tariffs in the first stage;(iii) the implication in paragraph 24 (b) of the proposals that the objective ofthe later stages of the Agreement would be the abolition of tariffs.7. In assessing the significance of their proposals and the extent to whichwe could hope to see them modified in negotiation, I think it is important to bearin mind the following points:  (i) The political pressure for the inclusion of agriculture in a Free Trade Arearemains strong in many European countries.(ii) Tariffs and quotas on industrial goods are to be completely abolished in theFree Trade Area.(iii) Tariffs and quotas on agricultural goods are to be abolished among the Sixunder the Treaty of Rome.On the other hand, there is this very important fact that the abolition of tariffs andquotas among the Six is to be accompanied by the development of an even moreprotective system based upon planned marketing, minimum price schemes, &amp;c, andthe Six have made it quite clear in their Memorandum, and elsewhere, that they intend to preserve the right to differentiate between members of the Six and other european countries in their agricultural trading arrangements. They are determined that the European Economic Community should become a preferential system forthe purposes of agricultural trade. This causes considerable concern to countries such as Denmark, but, as a negotiating factor, is clearly of great advantage to us,as they can hardly deny to us what they claim for themselves.8. The objection to the proposals of the Six will come partly from theCommonwealth and partly from our National Farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.Us.).Commonwealth Objections9. The Commonwealth object to the whole system of the Six, and some commonwealth countries are opposing it vigorously in the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.). We will have to explain to them, as I am sure we can at Montreal, that nothing in the proposed Agricultural Agreement will prejudice theposition in the GATT. They have also argued that an Agricultural Agreementmay promote the spread of the principles of the Treaty of Rome to other european countries. I do not think this is a very realistic criticism. Their main market is theUnited Kingdom, and this we have undertaken to preserve.  So far as the other
European countries outside the Six are concerned, whether there is a Free trade area or not, they will tend to come to terms with the Six on these matters, and weare in no position to prevent them.10. The preservation of their position in the United Kingdom market would clearly be threatened by the provisions in paragraph 24 (b) of the proposals of the six about the abolition of Customs duties.The N.F.Us.11. The three proposals relating to tariffs in the first stage that the Six have putforward will clearly be opposed by the N.F.Us. I would hope, however, that wecould meet the point about not increasing the general level of tariffs, and provideour equivalent of some duty-free quotas, by the use of an undertaking on the linesI have suggested in Annex A. So far as the reduction of their high duties isconcerned, Appendix 2 of Annex B sets out in detail the commodities likely to be involved. The political difficulties are well known to my colleagues.12. The N.F.Us., like the Commonwealth, will be concerned with the implications of 24 (6) and also with the linkage between the Agricultural agreement and the Free Trade Area Agreement.13. It seems, therefore, that the two outstanding difficulties are, first, thelinkage of the Agricultural Agreement and the Free Trade Area Agreement;and, secondly, the proposal for the complete abolition of tariffs in the subsequentstages of the Agreement. The linkage problem is serious only in so far as itimplies putting us in a few years&apos; time in a very difficult negotiating position,when we may be under considerable pressure to agree on rules for the subsequentstages in agriculture. Clearly we must get the general limits within which these rules are to be framed defined in advance, and it must be made clear that theycannot, in any case, be such as to be inconsistent with our commitments to home agriculture and to the Commonwealth. The difficulty lies in the phrase inparagraph 24 (b) about the abolition of Customs duties and the elimination ofproduction and export subsidies &quot; so far as they may constitute trade barriers.&quot;Certainly, if read literally, this is wholly unacceptable to us. But it is equallyinconsistent with the attitude of the Six. As I have said, they have made it clearthat they intend to operate a preferential system based on planned marketing,and this cannot be done if all barriers of trade are to be abolished. I thereforethink it possible that we should be able to get 24 (b) amended to bring it more in line with our ideas. This is the vital problem, and we must continue to makeit clear that nothing can be acceptable to us that is inconsistent with the commitments to which I have referred at the beginning of this paper.R. M.Office of the Paymaster General, S.W. I,8th September, 1958.
ANNEX a free TRADE AREAUNDERTAKINGS IN RESPECT OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIONPOLICY AND LEVELS OF SUPPORTIntroductoryAt a meeting of Ministers presided over by the Prime Minister on Monday,23rd June, I was invited, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Agriculture, to consider in greater detail the possibility of offering, in the Free Trade Area negotiations, an undertaking on agricultural policybased on sub-paragraphs (i) and (iii) of paragraph 4 of the Minister of Agriculture^paper GEN. 580/5 [summarised in Appendix 3] and the most appropriate timing of such an offer in the light of the progress achieved in the rest of the negotiations.Compatibility with Policy and Legislation2. The purpose of this undertaking would be to reassure the Europeanagricultural exporting countries that, notwithstanding our inability automaticallyto reduce our tariffs on foodstuffs or to give them firm guarantees regardingparticular products, their market in this country would not be adversely affected,and might indeed expand. I recognise, of course, that any such undertaking mustbe compatible with current legislation, with agricultural policy as expressed inrecent White Papers, and with the many pledges given by Ministers to the industry.As I understand them, the legislative commitments to which we have to pay regardare:-(i) The requirements of the Agriculture Act, 1947, which are not affected bythe 1957 Act:(a) &quot; to promote and maintain a stable and efficient agricultural industry capable of producing such part of the nation&apos;s food and other agricultural produce as in the national interest it isdesirable to produce in the United Kingdom, and of producingit at minimum prices consistently with proper remuneration and living conditions for farmers and workers in agriculture and anadequate return on capital invested in the industry &quot; (and forthis purpose &quot; agriculture&quot; is defined so as to includehorticulture),(b) to determine guaranteed prices in the light of the conclusionsderived by Ministers from annual reviews of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry.(ii) The long term assurances given by the Agriculture Act, 1957, which lay down the minimum level of determination at annual reviews, both forthe guarantees in total and for the individual commodities. The mostinhibiting of these assurances in the present connection is the requirement to take account of cost increases in reaching the minimum required for any change in the total value of the guarantees.3. These commitments do not allow us, within existing policies, to agree inadvance to a reduction in the level of the guarantees to home agriculture in anyparticular circumstances or without considering the conclusions drawn each year from the relevant annual review.4. I appreciate too that we must not enter into any undertaking which would prevent Her Majesty&apos;s Government from increasing a particular subsidy for aparticular reason of policy, which would oblige us to keep down the actual subsidybill in so far as changes in this are due to factors outside the Governments control,or which would preclude the expansion of agricultural output, provided this wasnot the consequence of increased subsidies. (I agree with the Minister ofAgriculture that, if our farmers, on the basis of increased efficiency, can produce more of our food at home than they are now doing, there is every reason why theyshould do so.)54011B
A Guaranteed Share of Our Market for Europe5. What the Europeans would like most, of course, is a guaranteed share ofour market for their agricultural exports. This we cannot give them. It would introduce a new element of rigidity into our sources of supply. The effect wouldbe to place on the remainder of our suppliers both at home and in theCommonwealth the onus of carrying any fluctuation in our demand for foodstuffsfrom abroad. To implement such a guarantee might well require the use of importquotas and state trading, as well perhaps as action inconsistent with out-international obligations. For these and other reasons a guarantee of this kind could not be considered.Text of Undertaking6. At Appendix 1 is a formula which incorporates in (a) and (b) the substance of sub-paragraphs (i) and (iii), of paragraph 4 of GEN. 580/5. To (a) and (b)has been added an expression of our intention to increase efficiency and thusreduce the need for support. This, which is already the Government^ publiclystated policy, seems as far as we can go to meet pressure from Europe (and also from the Commonwealth) that we should accept a commitment to reduce support.Interpretation7. The full significance of this formula is not readily apparent and there area number of points of interpretation which should be made clear. These are dealtwith in Appendix 2, which also refers to some points of definition which will haveto be settled at a later date.Form and Context8. Much will depend on whether the undertaking is multilateral (subscribedto by all the contracting parties) or unilateral (given by the United Kingdom alone).Also important will be how closely it is linked with any general agreement on agriculture there may be.A Multilateral Undertaking9. A multilateral form of undertaking would naturally be much easier topresent to our own farmers, and, to the extent that it would bite on the forms of support practised on the continent of Europe, it would be more attractive toDenmark and to the Commonwealth also. To the same extent, however, it wouldbe less attractive to European countries generally than an undertaking given bythe United Kingdom alone. For us also there is a point of substance: if other european countries had signed the undertaking along with us, some of them wouldprobably experience as much, or more, difficulty than we should in implementingits terms; thus we should be less likely to be exposed to criticism in isolation andtherefore less liable to have to modify our policies under pressure of Europeanopinion.10. If the form is to be multilateral, there would be advantage for our ownfarmers (and for the Commonwealth) in modifying the wording in such a way that it does bite on the European practices, provided no greater commitment for ourselves is involved. Ways of doing this may emerge when the agriculturalexporting countries join in the discussion. I should naturally take advantage ofany opportunity that presented itself of this kind, consistently on the one handwith securing our objective and on the other with not increasing the commitments of the United Kingdom.A Unilateral Undertaking11. While more difficult at home, a unilateral undertaking would have greaternegotiating value in Paris, particularly vis-a-vis the Six. An undertaking signed by the United Kingdom alone might serve, where a multilateral one might not, asthe counterpart the Germans expect of us to their action in other ways to satisfy the food-exporting countries of Europe and Denmark in particular.Standard of Living Qualification12. One of the general objectives of the agricultural provisions of the Treatyof Rome and of our draft Agreement on Agriculture and therefore likely to form part of any probable arrangements on agriculture is that an adequate standard
of living for farmers should be ensured. Whether the undertaking is to bemultilateral or unilateral, there would be great advantage in presenting it to ourfarmers to have an explicit reference to the need to maintain an adequate standardof living for them. This the Minister of Agriculture regards as presentationallyessential, and I accept his judgment in this matter, even though from some points of view it might be regarded as a two-edged weapon, e.g., to be used against us asimporters of foodstuffs.Application of Undertaking13. So far it has been a cardinal point of our policy that binding decisionsunder the arrangements for agriculture will be by unanimous vote. If we stand bythis, in whatever form our undertaking is worded, we cannot be compelled to take action against our will to implement it. Nevertheless, whether the undertaking ismultilateral or unilateral, and whatever qualifications are attached to it, we have torecognise that we are giving the Europeans a further opening through which theywill be able to exert great pressure on our agricultural policies.Tactics and Timing14. The furthest that I suggest we might go, and for which I am seeking authority from my colleagues, is a commitment as set out in Appendix 1. I shalltry, of course, to use only one, or only two, of the three legs of this formula, if our negotiating purpose can be achieved by offering less than the whole formula. Ishall also endeavour, as the Minister of Agriculture strongly desires, to gainacceptance for a multilateral form of undertaking, though I should like authority in the last resort of offer an undertaking entered into by the United Kingdom alone.15. As to the best time at which we could inject into the negotiations anundertaking of this sort, we are undoubtedly in something of a dilemma. The Sixhave now produced a memorandum. A number of elements in this areunacceptable; but we must put ourselves in a position to discuss it. For example,we have to find a way to dispose of the question of duty-free quotas. Anotherawkward point in the Six&apos;s memorandum is the proposal that for the first fouryears there should be a standstill on tariffs with a base date of 1st January, 1957.A possible way of meeting this, while retaining sufficient freedom to vary specificduties, would be to adapt the formula relating to producers&apos; subsidies so as to apply equally to tariffs. We therefore need to know fairly soon what we can say about our production policy and levels of support.16. On the other hand, I recognise that there would be advantage from the domestic point of view in holding the position on agriculture until the negotiations were approaching their climax. I appreciate that the Minister of Agriculture would prefer that no undertaking of this kind be given. I realise too that before floatingan undertaking in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation we mustcarry with us the leaders of the National Farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.Us.), and that ifthey cannot be brought along we must reconsider the matter. I also take the point that it might be easier to secure their acquiescence if it could be shown that asettlement on agriculture was the last remaining obstacle to the conclusion of anagreement on the Free Trade Area. On the other hand, in view of the time-tablethere is something to be said for taking Sir James Turner, President of the N.F.U.,and his colleagues into our confidence as we go along rather than springing our intentions on them at the last moment. If and when we break the log jam on theindustrial side, it might be desirable to move very quickly on agriculture. Andthe imminence of the Montreal Conference bears too on this question. We have therefore to balance the advantages of leaving matters until maximum pressurecan be brought on the N.F.Us. against the advantages of consulting them at an earlier stage, so that we can be ready to move quickly if we need to. I suggest that my colleagues might give the Minister of Agriculture and me discretion to approach the N.F.Us. as soon as it seems desirable.Commonwealth Considerations17. The solution of our difficulties in Europe is closely related to a similarproblem confronting us in the Commonwealth. New Zealand tabled at the recentofficial Commonwealth meetings proposals for the international acceptance of principles not so very different from some parts of the formula at Appendix 1. Itis clearly necessary that before Montreal we should have a pretty clear idea ofSECRET54011 B 2
Annex A, Appendix 1FORMULAThe Contracting Parties, having regard to the objectives of this agreement and subject to its provisions, in particular to the need for each to maintain anadequate standard of living for those engaged in agriculture in its country, shallnot as a deliberate act of policy increase guaranteed prices or like means of priceor income support with the object of:  (a) raising the real or effective value of the total of producers&apos; subsidies; nor(b) producing in their country a larger proportion of their total requirements for agricultural products.Further, the Contracting Parties shall seek by improving efficiency to reduceprogressively the need for direct or indirect subsidies.Annex A, Appendix 2POINTS  OF INTERPRETATION AND DEFINITIONCost and price changes1. In (a) of the formula in Appendix 1 the phrase &quot; real and effective value &quot;would permit increases that may be necessary to make up for either falls in thevalue of money or increases in the cost of factors of production.Flexibility2. The undertaking in (a) of Appendix 1 applies to the total of producers&apos;subsidies, and both (a) and (b) of Appendix 1 would allow for changes as betweenthe guarantees on different products within the total.Scope3. The undertakings in (a) and (b) of Appendix 1 relate solely to actionwithin a Governments control, i.e., that related to the level of the guaranteed prices or like means of price or income support. There is no obligation to keepdown the actual subsidy bill in so far as changes in this are due to factors outsidewhere we can go on this in the context of the Free Trade Area negotiations. Ofcourse any general undertaking which we may give to Europe on the lines of appendix 1 would offer the Commonwealth equal opportunity to benefit.Conclusions18.   I therefore seek my colleagues&apos; agreement:  (i) to a form of undertaking on the lines of Appendix 1 as the furthest wecould go;(ii) that an approach should be made to the N.F.Us. by the Minister ofAgriculture and myself when we think it desirable;(iii) that I should deploy this in Europe on the basis that:  (a) I should only offer as much of the formula as was necessary to secure agreement, and(b) I should endeavour to get acceptance of a multilateral undertaking,offering a unilateral one by the United Kingdom only if this isessential.R. M.September 1958.
a Governments control, such as changes in world commodity prices or in output,and are not due to changes in the guarantees. While (b) is compatible with currentlegislation, care would be required to ensure that the method of its implementationdid not entail conflict with legislation.Products covered4. The demands of the Europeans will be aimed at the products which wesupport by price guarantees under the Agriculture Acts, but if the undertakingis to be a multilateral one it would be necessary for all products included in thescope of the arrangements for agriculture in the Free Trade Area to be included.Our present thought is that the products to be included should be the agricultural(including horticultural) products covered by Annex II of the Treaty of Rome.Base period and method of calculation5. The question of a suitable base period and method of calculation forthe undertaking in (b) of Appendix 1 will arise, but it is not necessary to decide that at this stage.Reduction of support6. The statement on this in the formula is, like (a) and (b), subject to the qualification in the preamble about an adequate standard of living for our farmers.It states only an objective which we should try to attain, and it is not a new departure.Annex A, Appendix 3FORMS OF UNDERTAKING(Summary of Paragraph 4 of Gen 58015)(i) This was a standstill on producers&apos; subsidies: an undertaking not toincrease the total of producers&apos; subsidies by increasing guaranteed prices or like means of price or income support, save as may be necessary to offset increases in the cost of factors of production.(iii) This was the market sharing concept: it would not be an object of our policy by increasing the level of our guarantees to increase the proportionof our total food and feed requirements grown at home.
ANNEX B.AGRICULTURE AND THE FREE TRADE AREA1. The purpose of this paper is to seek Ministers&apos; preliminary instructions onthe line to be taken with the Commonwealth at Montreal and with the national farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.Us.) on proposals made by the Six Powers for an AgriculturalAgreement parallel to the Free Trade Area for non-agricultural products.Present United Kingdom policy . Ministers have from the start laid down that foodstuffs should be excludedfrom the Free Trade Area arrangements. This was to safeguard the Commonwealthpreferences on foodstuffs in the United Kingdom market (upon which our preferencesin the Commonwealth markets depend) and to assure United Kingdom producersthat their protection would be maintained.3. It immediately became clear that the straight exclusion of foodstuffs wouldbe unacceptable to the Europeans. The food exporters required a quid pro quofor the opening of these markets for industrial goods: the Danes, in paticular,needed provisions in the Free Trade Area which would safeguard their interests inthe food markets of the Six.4. The idea of a parallel agricultural agreement developed accordingly, andin January 1958 (after full consultation with the Commonwealth) we circulated adraft agreement covering the whole range of policy affecting agricultural productionand trade, and in particular providing:  (a) Institutional arrangements of a more positive character than those ofO.E.E.C. for consultation, examination and justification of national policies on production and trade.(b) Rules for trade in agricultural products based on existing obligations inO.E.E.C. and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.).(c) Arrangements for eliminating quotas and (if other countries wished it)tariffs on agricultural products over a definite period, but the UnitedKingdom would require a waiver in respect of tariffs.(d) A framework of association in differing degrees and commodity bycommodity with the institutions of the Six.5. Ministers will have before them, at the same time as this paper, a separate paper (Annex A) concerning the possibility of reinforcing the agreement byundertakings about production policies and subsidies either multilateral, to beaccepted by all members, or to be made bilaterally by the United Kingdom as thecomplement of a waiver in respect of tariff reductions.6. This combination of an agreement for closer co-operation and a specificundertaking about the intentions of the United Kingdom&apos;s agricultural policy notonly represents a substantial contribution towards the quid pro quo that the foodexporters can legitimately demand, but also is the limit to which we have hithertothought it possible to go within limits of existing policies and commitments.Proposals of the Six7. After putting forward our own views, we have repeatedly pressed the Sixto formulate theirs, and at last they have done so. Their English text (in some respects obscurely translated) is attached as Appendix 1.8. These proposals appear to provide for closer co-operation on lines not greatly different from those of our own proposals. But there are three relatedpoints which go far beyond anything that we have yet contemplated:  (a) specific obligations on tariffs should be made for the first four-year stage;(b) during the first stage new rules should be proposed to govern the subsequent period;(c) the progress from the first to the second stage of the industrial Free trade area should be conditional upon agreement on progress to the second stage of the Agricultural Agreement.
9. The first-stage tariff obligations involve a standstill on tariffs on agricultural products for this period; the reduction of certain very high duties; thegrant of certain tariff quotas with reduced rates of duty or duty-free.10. The Six appear to envisage that the provisions for subsequent stages,to be negotiated during the first stage, would include an obligation ultimately toabandon tariffs, quotas and (in so far as these constitute trade barriers) productionsubsidies.United Kingdom attitude to Tariff Proposals11. The tariff proposals as they stand are clearly unacceptable to the UnitedKingdom. If the Six (and the other prospective Free Trade Area members) wishto make an agreement providing for the reduction or elimination of tariffs among themselves on agricultural and horticultural products, we cannot be a party to itand our policy is to insist upon a waiver.12. If we depart from this line, even on a basis that seemed reconcilable withthe interests of United Kingdom producers and the Commonwealth, threeconsequences would follow:  (i) the United Kingdom producers and the Commonwealth would loseconfidence in Ministers&apos; pledges;(ii) having agreed to negotiate a temporary arrangement for the first stage,we could not refuse to negotiate later for subsequent stages;(iii) having conceded our main point on principle, we should have no soliddefence against further concessions.13. Apart from this general consideration, the first-stage proposals of the Six(paragraph 9 above) are not acceptable on merits:  (i) A standstill on every agricultural tariff would be incompatible with ministers&apos; undertakings to the horticultural producers to consider claims for higher tariffs on their merits; it would prevent adjustments todischarge our responsibilities to Colonies&apos; interests; and it could workto the Commonwealths disadvantage in the important case of meat.(ii) The reduction of very high duties (30 per cent, is mentioned by theGermans) would at present affect some horticultural and shell fishitem (Appendix 2 lists the items which would have been so affected in 1956on the basis of actual or average ad valorem incidence) but the specifichorticultural duties are designed to protect the producer in conditionsof glut, when their ad valorem incidence may rise far above 30 percent.; to limit to this figure (and we cannot be sure that a lower figurewill not be proposed) would damage the protection at the time when itwas needed most.(iii) We have examined the possible use of tariff quotas on food, and have found overwhelming practical difficulties.14. These proposals could perhaps be modified in negotiation to a point atwhich they were not damaging in substance in the first stage. But the considerations in paragraph 12 above would still seem decisive, and we would advise Ministers tocontinue to insist on a waiver from tariff reductions (if these are to be includedin an Agricultural Agreement).15. Nevertheless, the idea behind the Six&apos;s proposal for a tariff standstillmust be accepted as valid. If the food exporters are to commit themselves firmlyto abolish their tariff on industrial goods, the United Kingdom cannot reasonably expect to retain complete freedom to increase its tariffs on foodstuffs. therefore we have to consider whether there is any way, consistent with the policy inparagraph 11, of dealing with this problem.16. We have considered the suggestion that parallel with the undertakingunder consideration by Ministers for production policies and subsidies, thereshould be an undertaking by which we should be bound not to increase ouraggregate tariff protection.17. We envisage that the terms of such an undertaking about tariffs would leave us free to revalorise to take account of the fall in the value of moneysubsequent to an acceptable base date; but it would not be practicable to make the
undertaking subject to other wider qualifications, e.g., the maintenance of anadequate standard of living for the United Kingdom producer as is proposed inthe case of the undertaking on production policies and subsidies.18. Such an undertaking would be difficult to define precisely and we shouldhave to satisfy Europe as we went along that we were operating it reasonably. Inpractice it would mean:  (i) a tariff increase would not necessarily have to be offset by equivalentreduction elsewhere; we might often be able to claim that the increase could be made without raising the aggregate level of effective protectionabove that permitted.(ii) even if we could make no such claim, offsetting reductions ought not topresent impossible difficulties so long as the increase was small;(iii) it would however be very difficult to make reductions in tariffs incompensation for any large tariff increases, and the limitation whichthis would impose on us must be recognised.19. It will be seen that an undertaking on the above lines would represent a significant departure from existing policy.20. To sum up, we would advise Ministers to maintain their previous position on tariffs but to be willing to consider an undertaking limiting our aggregate of tariff protection.21. Ministers may also wish to bear in mind against a later stage of thenegotiations:  (i) the possibility of a limited number of reductions in tariffs where these would give practical help at sensitive points to individual countries;(ii) that there are certain tariff adjustments of a more general character whichcould be done without significant damage to United Kingdom producers and to the Commonwealth provided that certain important exceptionscould be made. Examples are the binding to Europe of nil tariffs(Appendix 3) or the abolition of the basic 10 per cent, duty onhorticultural products outside our production and marketing season(Appendix 4).22. We do not at this stage seek instructions from Ministers on these possibilities, nor is it suggested that any reference should be made to them in discussion with the Commonwealth or the N.F.Us.The Link between an Agricultural Agreement and the Free Trade Area23. The proposal to make the Free Trade Area&apos;s progress from the first stage to the second and subsequent stages contingent upon the negotiations during thefirst stage of an adequate long-term Agricultural Agreement is clearly unacceptable.This would destroy the confidence both of the United Kingdom producers and ofthe Commonwealth that we intended to stand by our present policy. We couldbe subjected to formidable pressures, and the integrity of our agricultural policy would be at risk.24. The permanent regime for agricultural tariffs and quotas must be settled at the beginning (as is the Six&apos;s in the Rome Treaty). It cannot be left for negotiation later.25. But it would be unrealistic to believe that the Free Trade Area could bebrought into being, stage by stage, through the fifteen year period, unless thearrangements for agriculture were working smoothly and were giving reasonablesatisfaction to the food exporters.26. We therefore recommend that Ministers reject the idea of a temporaryagreement on tariffs and quotas for agricultural products, with subsequentnegotiation of a permanent agreement, and insist that the agricultural regime fortariffs and quotas must be decided at the outset. But given agreement over this,we must face that there will be some collective judgment by member countries on progress both in the agricultural and in the industrial fields and that there maywell have to be some provision in the Treaty which recognises their inter-dependence. We may be led to conclude on this account that there should be oneTreaty and not two.
Consultation with National Farmers&apos; Unions27. We recommend that Ministers&apos; decisions on these matters should bediscussed with the N.F.Us. at the same time as the proposed undertakings on production and subsidy policy.Policy at Montreal28. The June discussions showed the concern in the Commonwealth aboutthe implications of an agreement for agriculture, and in particular the fear that we might find ourselves supporting (or acquiescing in) policies by the Six and the free trade Area which would be damaging to the interests of Commonwealthagricultural exporters to Europe. The proposals of the Six have been given to theCommonwealth, and will no doubt have increased these fears. We shall be expectedto state our position.29. We recommend that on the question of tariffs, we tell the Commonwealththat we are standing by our present policy we should not disclose the possibilityof an undertaking on aggregate tariff protection because it is not proposed to disclose the possible analogous undertakings on production and subsidy policy.30. We recommend that on the question of a link between an AgriculturalAgreement and Free Trade Area, our policy should be fully explained to theCommonwealth as in paragraphs 23-26 above.31. There is also the definition of commodity coverage of an AgriculturalAgreement, which is of direct interest to the Commonwealth. The only definitionacceptable to the Free Trade Area countries will be the list in Annex II of the rome Treaty (and this also suits United Kingdom interests). The Commonwealthhave been made fully cognisant of the position and we recommend that they nowbe told that we intend to accept this list.Future Discussions32. We propose that after discussion with the N.F.Us. and the Commonwealthon the lines indicated above, the matter should then be reconsidered by Ministers,and definite decisions taken, in the light of these discussions and of such furtherindications as can be obtained of the views of the Six and the other O.E.E.C.countries. We think it will be necessary to take these definite decisions around themiddle of October.54011
Annex B, Appendix 1AGRICULTUREMemorandum by the Six Powers of the Rome TreatyText of amended English translationI. General Considerations1. The Community has no objection to agriculture being dealt with in aseparate Treaty. Nevertheless in their view the relationships which should beestablished between the agricultural Treaty of Association and the Treaty ofEuropean Economic Association are such that it would be much simpler to conclude a single Treaty.If it is ultimately decided to enter into two distinct Treaties, the Communitybelieves that they should in fact be concluded simultaneously and should be linkedtogether, particularly by inserting a clause in each stipulating that its coming intoforce and execution is contingent on the coming into force and execution of theother.The two Treaties would thus be linked not only as to their coming into forcebut also at every stage of their implementation. It follows that the length of the transitional period should be the same in both Treaties and that the passage fromone stage to the next should take place simultaneously and under a procedure to be laid down.2. As regards the general content of the Treaty of Agricultural Association,it should include general principles and objectives valid throughout the whole life of the Treaty.On the other hand, certain of the obligations would be defined in detail for alimited period only, i.e., the first stage, during which the common agricultural policy of the Community and the concerted agricultural policy of the Associationare to be formulated.The specific commitments covering the subsequent stages would be determinedbefore the end of the first stage.Moreover, a certain number of problems arising under the Treaty ofAgricultural Association and the Treaty of European Economic Association willbe identical. This is true, in particular, of institutional questions, escape clausesand the passage from one stage to the next. In such cases, the Treaty ofAgricultural Association should provide for reference to the Treaty of european economic Association.3. The provisions on agricultural policy contained in the Treaty ofAgricultural Association must not be an obstacle to carrying out the common agricultural policy of the Community.The Community does, however, consider that the agricultural policies of all member countries should be confronted within the Association so that they willinfluence one another reciprocally.It goes without saying that in working out its common agricultural policy theCommunity will take account, as being an important element in determining that policy, of the fact that its members are at the same time partners in a widerassociation.4. The Community would like to reiterate certain principles which, in its opinion, should govern the progress and conclusion of the negotiations:in accordance with the Decision of the Council of the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) of 12th February, 1957, thepurpose of the Agreement under negotiation is to associate, on a multilateralbasis, the other Member countries of the O.E.E.C. with the Common Marketof the Six. This implies, among other things, that the other members of the
Association recognise that the objectives of the Rome Treaty are valid fromthe point of view of the principles of international trade;this Agreement must not in any way prejudice neither the content nor the implementation of the Rome Treaty;the existence and functioning of the Community cannot be regarded asinvolving discriminatory treatment against the other partner of theAssociation, but they may result in differences of treatment which are inherent in the position of such countries.5. There should be an express provision in the Treaty of Associationrecognising these fundamental principles. This could be inserted at the end ofthe Treaty and might be worded as follows:  (i) &quot; The Member States of the European Economic Community adhere assuch to the present Treaty subject to the following provisions and with[i.e., retaining] to all the rights and obligations of such membership.&quot;(ii) &quot; The obligations of the present Treaty shall apply to the relations whichthe Member States of the European Economic Community entertainwith the other Contracting Parties to the present Treaty which are not members of the European Economic Community.&quot;(iii) &quot; The present Treaty shall not apply to the relations between the member states of the E.E.C., which are governed by the Rome Treaty the implementation of which cannot be impeded by the Treaty of association.&quot;II. General Rules1. List of Products Covered by the Arrangements for Agriculture6. The products covered by the agricultural arrangements within the framework of the Association should in principle be the same as those considered to be so covered by the Rome Treaty. It is understood that additions will not bemade to Annex II of this Treaty under the procedure of Article 38, paragraph 3,before the Community has consulted its partners in the Association.2. General objectives of the Treaty7. The Member countries should formulate among themselves a concertedagricultural policy with the same objectives as those embodied in Article 39 ofthe Rome Treaty.8.  The following objective should however be added:  &quot; To free and promote trade between the Member countries of the association in order gradually to ensure a rational utilisation of the factors of agricultural production.&quot;The Community has no intention whatever of adopting an attitude of self-sufficiency. It was in this spirit that the Agricultural Conference of the member states of the Community, provided for in Article 43 of the Rome Treaty, drewup the following resolutions in particular:  &quot; The execution of the Treaty must lead naturally to a progressiveexpansion of trade within the Community; at the same time, attention mustbe paid to the need of maintaining trade and contractual, political andeconomic links with third countries, and retaining the power to protect theCommunity from unfair competition from outside.&quot;&quot; A balance must be sought between production and market possibilities,bearing in mind potential exports and imports, as well as specialisationappropriate to the internal economic structure and natural conditions ofthe Community.&quot;Although the provisions of the Rome Treaty, taken as a whole, provide anadequate guarantee regarding the expansion of trade between the Member States,it would be appropriate, in the absence of equivalent provisions in the Agreementof Association, to adopt the additional objective mentioned above as part of theco-ordinated policy.This objective should therefore make it possible for the partner countries to expand trade between themselves to the greatest possible extent and should preventimports from the partner countries falling below their present level.SECRET54011 c 2
III. Rules Applicable as from the First Stage1. Agricultural Policy9. The co-operation to be contemplated in the field of agricultural policy should be directed towards the progressive adjustment of national agriculturalpolicies in line with the general objectives defined in paragraphs 7 and 8 above.10. To this end, provision should be made for the systematic examination and confrontation of the national agricultural policies of Member countries of theAssociation.In addition to the general objectives laid down in paragraphs 7 and 8, more specific objectives should be assigned to this confrontation. A reference mightbe sought in the Decisions adopted by the Committee of Ministers for Agricultureof the O.E.E.C. on 3rd May, 1956.At the outset, the agricultural policy of each Member State of the community should be examined separately, but this separate examination should be replaced by an examination of the common policy of the Community as and when it iselaborated.11. The reports on the results of confrontation would be directed to theGovernments of Member States and where appropriate might be published.It should be made possible to complete the confrontation of policies by issuingdirectives to the Contracting Parties. Such directives should be adoptedunanimously by the appropriate institutions under a procedure to be determined.12. Provision should also be made for a complaints and arbitrationprocedure, whose details must be worked out. This procedure could be invokedin order to ensure that the general objectives laid down in 8 S 7 and 8 are observed.2. Provisions Relating to Customs Duties13. The Member States shall refrain from introducing between themselves new-Customs duties on imports or exports and from increasing those they already apply in their commercial relations with one another.The basic duty to be taken into consideration in applying this rule shall be theduty applied on 1st January, 1957. A limited number of exceptions to this rulemight be provided for and would be embodied in a list annexed to the Treaty.14.  Provision should also be made for:  lowering certain very high Customs duties. The countries and productssubject to this obligation and the level of reduction will be indicated in a protocol annexed to the Treaty of Association;the grant of certain tariff quotas with degressive or nil rates of duty [or duty-free].3. Provisions Relating to Quantitative Restrictions15. The Member States of the Association shall refrain from introducingbetween themselves new quantitative restrictions or measures with equivalent effect.This obligation will, however, apply only to the level of liberalisation reached inapplication of the Decision of the Council of the O.E.E.C. of 14th January, 1955.It should be laid down that exceptions may be made to this rule so thata country may be allowed, by a procedure to be determined, to depart from the standstill in respect of certain specified products, provided that it offerscompensation on other products.16. The Contracting Parties shall undertake to promote the conclusion of bilateral or multilateral agreements giving the other Contracting Parties, for eachof the products in respect of which liberalisation is not consolidated in accordancewith the standstill agreement, the guarantee of a reasonable volume of exports.Generally speaking, a reasonable volume shall be considered to be the averagevolume of imports during a reference period to be determined.Where national consumption of a given product has increased considerably, itshould be possible for imports of that product to be increased, while taking accountof any increase in national production.
17. Finally, Member States shall endeavour, as part of the progressiveelaboration of the concerted policy, to establish a programme for the abolition ofthe quantitative imports restrictions still in force, including where necessary, and aspart of the co-ordination of marketing organisations, those resulting from theexistence of State-trading bodies and import monopolies.4. Subsidies18. The Community considers that the Treaty of Association should include provisions dealing with both production subsidies and export subsidies as both ofthese affect trade.It is, moreover, essential that the regulations adopted should be such as tocover all types of subsidy, whether governmental or not.(a) Production Subsidies19. The amount of production subsidies designed to bridge the gap between a guaranteed producers price and a market price for certain products should beperiodically reviewed in connection with the confrontation of agricultural policieswith the object of progressively reducing those subsidies which abnormally restrict the development of intra-European trade.(b) Export Subsidies20. The question of eliminating export subsidies will also have to be dealtwith in the context of the concerted agricultural policy under a complaintsprocedure designed to eliminate the prejudicial consequences which such subsidiesmay have on trade.In this connection, it should be noted that a very careful examination shouldalso be made of the implications of Decision C. (55) 6 of the Council of theO.E.E.C. and the Recommendations of the O.E.E.C. Committee of Ministers for agriculture relating to export aids.5. Arrangements Relating to Specific Products21. (a) Under the system laid down by Article 45 of the Rome Treaty,long-term agreements or contracts are regarded as one of the ways of preparing theground for the common organisation of agricultural markets.The provisions of the Treaty of Association must not be such as couldprejudice the application of Article 45, which specifies the links existing in this fieldbetween Member States of the Community.(b) Subject to the above considerations, the following provisions might beincluded in the Treaty of Association with a view to encouraging the conclusion of long-term agreements and contracts.For those products where some of the partners in the Association haveeither:  (i) provisions designed to guarantee a market for national production, or(ii) import requirements,the development of trade might be pursued by concluding long-term agreements orcontracts between those partners in the Association who are importers and thosewho are exporters. The parties to such agreements or contracts will take intoaccount any obligations they may have towards third parties outside such arrangements.The parties to a long-term agreement or contract will, with a view to reaching asatisfactory settlement, enter into consultation with any other partner in theAssociation which considers itself prejudiced by such arrangements. If such asettlement cannot be reached within a reasonable time, a complaints procedure willbe available under procedure to be subsequently specified.IV. Subsequent Stages22. It is recalled that, in the conception of an Agricultural Treaty as defined in this memorandum, the general provisions referred to in Chapters II and III aboveconstitute rules which will be valid during the whole life of the Treaty.
Annex B, Appendix 2REDUCTION OF CERTAIN VERY HIGH DUTIESThe following are the food and agricultural products where:  1. the approximate average ad valorem incidence of specific duties (mostlyseasonal ones on horticultural items) under the United Kingdom tariffexceeded 30 per cent, for the appropriate period of 1956; it should benoted that in times of glut the incidence of specific duties on other itemsmay also exceed 30 per cent, for short periods;2. the duty under the United Kingdom tariff is an ad valorem one of 30 per cent,or more.23. Before the end of the first stage, it will be necessary to lay downsupplementary rules applicable to the subsequent stages.24. (a) These rules must, in particular, make it possible to develop theconfrontation of the agricultural policies of the Contracting Parties with a viewto drawing up a concerted agricultural policy, using, where necessary, the procedure of co-ordinating the national marketing organisations.(b) The abolition of Customs duties and the elimination of quantitative restrictions and, so far as they may constitute trade barriers, of production and export subsidies will be developed in parallel with the establishment of the concertedpolicy.V. Institutional Problems25. Institutional problems in relation to the Treaty of Agricultural Associationcan only be studied in detail after the general institutional question has been studied.It is however, desirable at this stage to emphasise the special importance ofinstitutional problems in the agricultural sphere, particularly in relation toimplementing the concerted policy. It will be necessary to contemplatestrengthening the institutional system progressively as this policy is implemented.VI. Escape Clauses26. It is recalled that the provisions of the Treaty of European economic association relating to escape clauses will also apply in the agricultural sphere byreason of the provisions for cross-reference referred to in paragraph 2 of thismemorandum.27. The Community considers that the question of general rules dealing withminimum prices only arises so far as there is any dismantling of tariffs or quotas tothe agricultural sphere.At the same time, this consideration allows the partners to provide for theapplication of minimum prices bilateral or multilateral agreements.VII. Provisions for the Protection of Health28. The Community considers that the Contracting Parties should declarethemselves determined to take all necessary action to ensure that no healthprotection measures exercise an unfavourable influence on agricultural trade. Anagreement in this sense should be concluded within two years after the Treatycomes into force. This regulation should exclude any possibility of discriminatingbetween the treatment of national products and imported products.VIII. Special Position of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg in the AgriculturalSphere29. The Community asks that the system laid down by Article 1 of the protocol on the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg annexed to the Rome Treaty shouldbe repeated in the Treaty of Association.
Annex B, Appendix 4SCOPE FOR REMOVING THE 10 PER CENT. GENERAL AD VALOREMDUTY OR EQUIVALENT SPECIFIC DUTIES ON HORTICULTURALPRODUCTSI. Officials have considered the practicability and the negotiating value of offering to remove the 10 per cent, general ad valorem duty (or specific duties of equivalent incidence) outside the main season during which home-grown produce ismarketed.   Their conclusions are summarised in the following paragraphs.2. It should be possible to remove the duty outside the United Kingdomseason without significant damage to the United Kingdom or the Commonwealthon peaches and nectarines (not hothouse), Clementines, bitter oranges, salad chicoryand apricots. About  1-2 millions of trade from O.E.E.C. countries would be covered in the possible periods of concession. The concession would be of substantial benefit to Italy as regards the first three items and would also havea considerable political appeal to her. The concession on chicory would have acertain appeal in Belgium.3. Similar types of concessions could be made on tomatoes, strawberries,plums and greengages, grapes (hothouse), cherries, cucumbers, asparagus andunshelled green peas without significant damage to any Commonwealth interest.Concessions on these items, however, would give rise to argument with domestic producers and, in the case of tomatoes, with the Channel Islands producers. Duringthe possible periods of concession imports from O.E.E.C. of all these items are currently worth about  250,000. Italy would benefit materially as regards cherries,and the Netherlands as regards cucumbers. A concession on strawberries andasparagus would have a political appeal to France, where these items are of localimportance.4. The remaining items considered are dry bulb onions, lemons, grapes (nothothouse), melons and sweet oranges. The O.E.E.C. countries supply about 3 - 8 millions of these items during the possible periods of concession. So far asonions are concerned, the concession would appeal to the Netherlands, Belgium,France and, above all, to Italy. The chief beneficiary on lemons would again beItaly; on grapes (not hothouse) Italy, Greece, France, Portugal and Turkey; onmelons, the Netherlands, France, Italy and Turkey; and on sweet oranges Italyand Greece. From the domestic point of view the concession would present difficulty only in so far as onions are concerned, but the harmful effect here mightbe considerable. The Channel Islands might suffer slightly from a concession ongrapes. From the Commonwealth point of view Cyprus stands to lose significantlyon all the items; Malta on onions, South Africa on onions and slightly on someof the other items. The British West Indies might lose significantly on sweetoranges and slightly on lemons; Australia would lose slightly on sweet oranges.5. There are a number of other horticultural items not covered in the paragraphs above, but where there is a seasonal variation in the tariff. In thecase of bulb flowers and freesias the supplies available from the Continent outsidethe United Kingdom season are so small as to make a tariff concession not worthoffering. Apples and pears have not been regarded as possible subjects for this type of concession, since they cannot be considered apart from the issue of quotarestriction.6. The conclusions summarised in the preceding paragraphs have beenreached on the assumption that the proposed tariff concession could be confined to O.E.E.C. countries and that we would not be required under the rules of GATT.to extend it to third countries enjoying most-favoured-nation rights. So far as wecan judge at present, this assumption is correct.farina and wet salted split fish would be of material value to the main suppliers(Norway, Netherlands, Denmark, Belgium and Iceland); our imports of the threeproducts from them in 1956 were valued at  6-2 millions.5. There remains a third group of items mutton and lamb, hams, apples andorange juice where for various reasons of policy there would be the greatest difficulty about giving the undertaking.
