(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJES TY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (58) 196 COPY NO.26th September, 1958CABINETSOCIAL, INVESTMENTMemorandum by the Financial Secretary, treasury on 24th July, the Cabinet (C. C. (58) 64th Conclusions, Minute 5)invited the Home Secretary in consultation with the Chancellor and other interested Ministers, to examine the social investment programmes inrelation to competing claims on investment resources during the next fewyears.   The Home Secretary made an interim report to the Cabinet on31st July, and was invited to continue his review of social investment(C. C. (58) 66th Conclusions, Minute 6).   The group of Ministers concernedwith social investment discussed these matters further on 24th September.Consequently I was invited to report to the Cabinet the issues which arise in seeking to combine forward policies in social investment with the limitations on aggregate public investment provisionally agreed by theCabinet on 24th July.General background. On 24th July the Cabinet considered E. ^. (58) 59 by theChancellor of the Exchequer, containing a picture of public investmentgenerally over the years up to 1962/63 and proposals for permitting asubstantial but controlled growth in the years 1959/60 and 1960/61.   Acopy of the Annex to that paper is attached, showing the grand totals ofpublic investment proposals in round figures as follows:-  millions1956/57   1957/58   1958/59   1959/60   1960/61   1961/62 1962/631,340       1,430        1,425       1,520       1,670      1,740 1,780Annualgrowth  millions                    +90             -5           t-95       +150           +70 +40Since E. A. (58) 59 was prepared bids for further increases in investmenthave been indicated by some Departments and the total for the year 1960/61would now be  1,675 millions.3. The paper stressed in particular the dangers of an overload ofpublic investment in 1960/61 and the Cabinet agreed that the chancellor should provisionally work to public investment totals of  1, 500 millions for 1959/60 and  1,575 millions for 1960/61.   This would have involvedreductions of about  20 millions and  95 millions respectively in the programmes inE. A. (58) 59.     The reduction which would be needed in the programmes as they now stand to comply with the Cabinet decision above would be about  100 millions for the year 1960/61.-1-
4.        Discussions are going on between the Treasury and theDepartments, and other authorities, on the various programmes inaccordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 24th .. July.  Of the total public investment in 1960/61, about  980 millions or nearly 60 per centrelates to nationalised industries.   Further work needs to be ddnebefore the Boards and Ministers responsible for those industries will beable to form a view on the scale of reduction which is practicable.   It is,however, already clear that major and highly contentious issues of policy are bound to arise, particularly on transport, power and communication.For example, a very large reduction - perhaps in the region of 40 millions - will on any reckoning need to be considered in the caseof the British Transport Commission.   The difficulties are clear in viewof the pressure to increase railway investment which manifested itself in the last railway wages settlement; and reduced investment may setback, to the cost of the Exchequer, the time at which the railways willbe self-supporting.   Then again a large reduction would need to beconsidered in the power field, perhaps involving a further rephasing ofthe nuclear power programme, reduction in plant provision generally and some slowing down of the pace of rural electrification.   All these and similar issues will have to be submitted to the Cabinet as soon asthe Departments responsible for these services are able to assess theposition.   It seems unlikely that this can be done on even a broad basisbefore the middle of October.   It would be unsafe to assume that it wouldbe possible to transfer reductions from social investment to the industrialside of public investment, upon which in any case the development of the economy significantly depends.Social Service and other investment5.        The programmes of social investment under consideration areeducation, hospitals, housing and prisons.   The prisons programme is relatively very small: and some provision has already been allowed for growth of miscellaneous investment in which prisons are included.   Inview of this there is general agreement that reduction of the prisonsprogramme need not be considered further in this context.   The followingtable shows the figures in E.A.(58) 59 for other social elements - afteradjustment in 1960/61 in respect of the addition mentioned in paragraph 2.  millions1956/57     1957/58    1958/59     1959/60    1960/61Education(includingScotland)Hospitals(includingScotland)Housing(includingScotland)New Towns(includingScotland)97.5        105.915.8 20.493.422. 897.6        108.124.9 30.4340.3 310.2        272. 5        249.6        253.5Total453.6        436. 5        388.7        372.1        392.0
6.       On a proportionate basis the contribution of this sector towards a reduction of  100 millions in 1960/61 might be reckoned as about 23 millions.   Sucn an approach, however, takes no account of needs or economic consequences:  it assumes (which is almost certainly not thecase) that a proportionate reduction could be made in other sectors:these include (in addition to the nationalised industries) roads, water and sewerage and universities.   The roads programme is based on the four-year plan recently announced: work is already going on faster than expected and there is heavy pressure for an increase.   Expenditure onwater and sewerage has been severely restricted in the past and reductions might involve health or economic haoards.   The universities&apos;programme implements the plans announced by the Government on20th February.   In all the circumstances the Treasury estimate that thenecessary reduction in the education, hospitals and housing programmes in 1960/61 might be of the order of  25 millions- 30 millions.   Theeffect which this would have on these individual programmes is discussed in the following paragraphs.EducationEngland and wales the proposals of the Minister of Education are as follows:-  millions Work &quot;Done1959/60 1960/61 1961/62 1962/63 1963/64 1964/65Primary and secondary 51.0       51.0 56.9 63.1 68. 5 72.5Further Education 13.0 14.4 15.0 15.0 15.0 15.0Training of teachers 1.6 4.7 7.0 4.4 1.5 1.0Special Schools and school Meals 5.2         6.0 6.5 6. 5           6.5 6.5Minor Works 10.0       12.0 14.0 14.0 14.0 14.0Total BuildingInvestment 80. 8 88.1 99.4 103.0 105.5 109.plant and machinery 3.5         3.7 3.9      4.0           4.0         4.0Total 84.3       91. 8     103.3   107.5        109.5     113.0
These proposals assume that starts for primary and secondary schools will be increased from  46 millions in 1959/60 to  60 millions in 1960/61.   Thereafter they increase by  5 millions a year up to 70 millions in 1962/63.8.        The Cabinet have already approved a programme of teacher training which involves the increases shown in the table above, but ifschool starts in 1960/61 are kept at the 1959/60 level of  46 millions and if the minor works item were reduced by  2 millions,  5.3 millionscould be saved in 1960/61.   To get a much larger saving than this itwould be necessary either to reduce starts already announced for 1959/60or to make a large reduction in starts in 1960/61 below the levels for1959/60.9.        If school starts were kept at  46 millions a year from 1959onwards, there would be a gradual shift of resources from building to accommodate the &quot;bulge&quot; to building to improve old schools.   By 1964some    25: millions- 30 millions a year would be devoted to improvements,but there would be very little extra for improvements in 1960/61.Scotland10.       The Scottish proposals, which are designed to match the Englishproposals, involve spending:-  millions Work Done1958/59     1959/60     1960/61    1961/62     1962/63     1963/6413.1 15.3 16.3 17.4 19.2 20.0These proposals contain no large element for teacher training facilities,which are not deficient in Scotland.   If  3 millions were deducted from the 16.3 millions proposed for 1960/61, the programme would still allow forsome increase in work done over the level authorised for 1959/60.   Thiswould be comparable with the English reductions envisaged above.Great Britain11.       The total reduction on the Great Britain figure of  108 millions which is feasible without reducing the rate of school starts already authorised for 1959/60 is therefore  8.3 millions.   The view of theeducation Departments is that, if the 1960/61 programme were reducedto this extent, it would not be possible to say that a &quot;forward drive&quot; in education was being launched, despite the increase in the teacher training programme and the growing diversion of resources from 1960/61 onwardsfrom provision for the &quot;bulge&quot; to improvements.HospitalsGreat Britain12.       The programmes porposed by the Health Ministers run asfollows :--4-
  millions Work Done Great Britain1957/58     1958/59    1959/60     1960/61     1961/6220.4 22. 8 24.9 30.4 35.4The increase of  5.5 millions between 1959/60 and 1960/61 amounts to20 per cent.England and Wales13.       The proposal is to spend  27 millions in 1960/61.   A reductionof  3 millions would be practicable, if the money allocated to hospital boards for normal projects were not increased above  11. 0 millions,which is the 1959/60 level.   It would still be possible to increase therate of starts for major schemes.Scotland14.       The proposed programme for 1960/61 is  3.4 millions.   Thepercentage increase over 1959/60 is less than in England.   If theprogramme was reduced by  200,000, the amount available to finance newstarts would be slightly more than in 1959/60.Great Britain15.       On this basis the savings on the proposed programmes for1960/61 would be  3,2 millions.Housing16.       When restrictions were placed on public investment a year ago,the Minister of Housing accepted a reduction from 120,000 to 100,000starts a year for public authority housing in England and Wales and it was expected that the programme would fall to 20,000 completions in Scotland.The figures in paragraph 2 are on the basis of continuance of these levels of starts in 1959/60 and 1960/61.   The Minister of Housing has now saidthat 120,000 is the desirable level in England and Wales in 1960/61.   if accepted, this would add  35 millions to the aggregate of public investment and would therefore increase the excess of  100 millions in 1960/61.This takes no account of Scottish repercussions.17.       In the recent reflationary programme the Chancellor agreed tothe addition of 7,500 houses to the current programme at a cost of 15 millions, in the expectation of a corresponding reduction in the costof housing in 1960/61.   If such a reduction were made and the rate ofstarts were reduced in good time to 92,500 in England and Wales, 15 millions would be saved in 1960/61, provided that starts in scotland were held to 20,000 a year.   The Secretary of State is considering thepossibilities of improving the present method of control.18.       In considering such a reduction the following points are relevant:-(a) About 85,000 starts a year are needed to fulfil the Govern-menfs slum clearance undertakings, and for new towns and overspill.-5-
(b) Starts of 92,500 would leave 7,500 for general needs in large towns which do not require overspill schemes but have an acute shortageof accommodation for old people, Service Departments and specialindustrial needs.(c) The housing programme can be adjusted at comparatively short notice, and if conditions were easy next year it would still be possibleto restore the programme to a higher figure.(d) Private housing is still growing and will get a fillip from theproposed scheme to assist private ownership through the building societies.(e) On the other hand, practically none of these private houses are for letting, and there is little private building in large parts of the country.19.       If the reductions envisaged above were made the total savings in1960/61 would be approximately as follows:-  millionsEducation   -   England and Wales (parag raph 8) 5.3Scotland (paragraph 10) 3.0Hospitals    -   England and Wales (paragraph 13) 3.scotland (paragraph 14) . housing       -   England and Wales (paragraph 17) 15.0Total 26.5On the above basis there might also be some small associated savings in1959/60, thus helping to keep within the proposed limit for that year:  butthis would not involve any reduction in the already authorised starts forthat year.Points for decision20.      On the assumption that the size of the public investment programmes in education, hospitals and housing for 1960/61 must be determined inadvance of settlement of investment programmes in other cases, the issuesfor decision by the Cabinet are:-(i)    Whether the reductions above ( 26jf millions in all) on theeducation, hospitals and housing programmes discussedare acceptable.(ii)    If not, what reductions should be aimed at and how thebalance is to be met, i. e., whether out of other programmesor by raising the ceiling of public investment generally for1960/61.J .E.S.S.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.26th September, 1958-6-
