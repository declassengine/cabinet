THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   July 1958C. (58) 156 Copy No.17th July, 1958.CABINETTERRITORIAL waters memorandum by the Lord chancellor at the request of the Cabinet (C.C. (58) 50th Conclusions, Minute 5) some ofmy colleagues and I have further considered the issues discussed in the Attorney-General&apos;s memorandum C. (58) 121 on the tactics to be adopted at the nextinternational discussion on the breadth of territorial waters in particular, thequestions:  (i) whether we should support the proposal that a further conference onthe law of the sea should be held; and(ii) whether we should seek to secure agreement for the regional settlementof fishery questions.2. The first question is relatively simple. The Cabinet will recall that the geneva Conference on the Law of the Sea, having failed to reach a decision onthe breadth of the territorial sea and exclusive fishing limits, have requested theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations to study the advisability of convening afurther conference on these subjects. We are faced with two alternatives. Whilethe decision does not, of course, rest with us, if we organise support among friendlyGovernments it is probable that we could secure agreement to a further conferenceand, again with the support of our friends, there is a reasonable chance that wecould then secure agreement to a six-mile territorial sea. This is of great importanceboth to our strategic and our fishery interests. Alternatively, we could oppose theproposal for a further conference or acquiesce in its defeat: in that case we shouldunquestionably be faced with a series of unilateral claims to a territorial sea of twelve miles or more which, because of the way in which international law comes to be formulated, would very soon become recognised as hardly less valid than an international convention. There seems, therefore, no doubt which course weshould pursue.3. My colleagues and I have carefully considered the difficulty felt by theColonial Secretary and the Minister of Defence over the right of innocent passageof military aircraft over territorial waters. We are satisfied that there is no hopeat all of securing agreement to this right in any convention on the law of the seawhich might emerge from a further conference. It follows that we cannot securethe right of innocent passage for military aircraft under either of the alternativespresented above and our conclusion is that, although the difficulty is a real one,it cannot affect the decision the Cabinet must take. If, therefore, we need to secure a legal right of passage for military aircraft at all which is by no means certain the best course is to pursue the question with the countries concerned through theordinary diplomatic channels. We might by this means secure agreements torights of passage through international straits, if not over territorial watersgenerally, especially if some minimum altitude could be specified.4. The second question whether we should try to secure that fisheryquestions are divorced from discussion of the territorial sea is more difficult.There seems no doubt that much of the pressure for a twelve-mile territorial seaderives from a desire to extend fishery rights and that if the two questions could53756
be divorced our hope of achieving a six-mile territorial sea would be materiallyincreased. On the other hand, there are real dangers in the holding of regionalfishery conferences. The Fisheries Ministers feel strongly that, if agreement were reached to fishery limits of twelve miles or more in one part of the world, thiswould be quoted against us as a precedent; the argument that different localconditions justified different fishery limits would be ignored; and we should be unable to achieve agreement to any narrower limits in the areas with which we and our friends are concerned. Nor is it certain that, even if they agreed toattend regional conferences, countries like Iceland would accept the majoritydecisions without wrecking reservations. And some of my colleagues have doubtseven whether the separation of fishery questions would in fact help us to achieve a six-mile territorial sea, since uncertainty about the outcome of fishery conferencesmight lead some countries still to press for a twelve-mile territorial sea.5. These are difficult questions of judgment, but it must be recognised thatany risk of a twelve-mile territorial sea is equally a risk to our fishery interests.On balance, therefore, we are inclined to favour a compromise which would restrict the next international conference to territorial waters proper but avoid any reference to regional fishery conferences as such. We might thus seek to secure a resolution by the General Assembly that a further conference be held onterritorial waters and, in addition, that member States should try to negotiatebilateral or multilateral agreements on fishery questions. We do not think, however,that we should commit ourselves to this proposition until we know more of theviews of our friends. We suggest, therefore, that the arguments for and againstseparate fishery conferences should be discussed with the Governments of theUnited States, the Commonwealth countries and friendly countries in Europe,with an indication that the provisional view of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is infavour of the compromise solution suggested.6.   We therefore recommend the Cabinet to agree (i) that we should support the proposal for a further conference on the law ofthe sea;(ii) that we should seek support for this proposal from the Governments ofthe United States, the Commonwealth countries and friendly countriesin Europe through the regular channels;(iii) that we should, at the same time, seek the views of those Governments onthe proposition, which on balance Her Majesty&apos;s Government favours,that we should work for a resolution of the General Assembly limiting the next conference to the breadth of territorial waters, and recommending the member States to negotiate among themselvesbilateral or multilateral agreements on fishery limits.K.House of Lords, S.W. I,17th July, 1958.
