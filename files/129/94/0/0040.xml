(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 190 COPY NO.  ^/23rd September, 1958CABINETTINMemorandum by the Minister of State, Board of trade the Cabinet considered the tin scheme on 11th September and may wish to know subsequent developments (C.C.(58) 71st Conclusions, ,Minute 6).2.      The floor price broke on 18th September.   The Chairman of theTin Council announced publicly that the Buffer Stock Manager had with-drawn, for the time being, his support of the floor price of  730 a ton,but that the matter would be discussed at a meeting of the Tin Council.(This was later fixed for 25th September, but this date has not been published. )  He added that the Tin Agreement would continue in force;and that the export restrictions on member-producers and the import restrictions imposed by the United Kingdom and other member-consumerson Russian tin would also continue.   After dropping to  640 aton, theprice rose to  671 a ton on 19th September and to about  700 a ton on22nd September.3.     The Cabinet asked that urgent consideration be given to thepossibility of negotiating, in conjunction with the United States, areconstruction of the Tin Agreement which would place the scheme on amore sound and economic basis.   The United States have been sounded andtheir reactions are discouraging.   We are considering what steps mightbe taken if the price were to fall to distress levels.   We are also examiningpossible amendments to the Agreement.4.      On 20th September Mr. Kamensky, the Soviet Trade Commissionerpurused me, in the absence of the President of the Board of Trade, tomy home in the country, accompanied by bis adviser, Mr. Troitsky.   Afterluncheon he presented me with a note - copy attached - which called our action in imposing import restrictions on U.S.S.R. tin an unfriendly one.My impression is that our action came as a shock to the Russians who had thought that they might, at leisure, pursue the idea of joining the TinCouncil while benefiting from the high prevailing prices and assuming noobligations to restrict their exports.5.     I will report orally any further developments but I do not recommend any further action at present.J.K.V.-M.Board of Trade, S.W.I.22nd September, 1958
VTranslation of Note handed to the Minister of State,3oard of Trade by Mr. KamenskyIn connection with the United Kingdom Board of Trade&apos;smemorandum of 29th August, 1958, regarding Soviet tin exports to theUnited Kingdom I am authorised to state the following.2.     The Soviet Government regards the decision taken unilaterally bythe Government of the United Kingdom to impose a licensing system andto establish a quota for tin imports from the U.S.S.R, as an unfriendlyact towards the Soviet Union.3.     In addition, the establishment of a quota for tin imports from theU.S.S.R. beginning from 30th August, 1958, when the Soviet Foreign trade organisations and British firms have already concluded contracts for the delivery of tin in the current year, may deprive them of the opportunityto fulfil these contracts and thus cause losses to both parties.4.     The Soviet authorities consider it necessary in the interests of thecreation of normal trade conditions between the two countries to enableboth the sellers and the buyers to fulfil their mutual obligations.   TheSoviet Government hopes that this question will meet with the UnitedKingdom Governments due consideration and understanding.5.     It should be noted that the receipts from the sale to the UnitedKingdom of tin as well as of other goods are used by the Soviet foreign trade Organisations for the purchase of goods from British firms,therefore your hindering the fulfilment of the signed contracts for the delivery of tin to the United Kingdom may naturally result in the cancellation of some of the contracts for the purchase of British goods.6.     It stands to reason that if the United Kingdom Government takesfurther action to reduce imports of Soviet goods, this may result in ageneral reduction of the volume of Anglo-Soviet trade which would hardly be to the benefit of either country.7.     As to the allegations to the effect that the existing difficulties inthe economy of under-developed countries are due to the tin exports fromthe Soviet Union-these are quite unjustified; these difficulties can, first and foremost, be accounted for by the economic recession in capitalistcountries.8.     We also consider it necessary to state that according to theinformation from the Foreign Trade Organisations of the Soviet Union,they do not in actual fact intend to sell tin to the United Kingdom in 1958in any quantities additional to those for which contracts have already been signed with British firms.
