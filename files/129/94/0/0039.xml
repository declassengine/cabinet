(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 18923rd September, 1958CABINETPENSIONSMemorandum by the Minister of Pensionsand National InsuranceAs requested by my colleagues of the Ministerial Committee on pensions I submit to the Cabinet a further draft of a White Paper.2.      The text of the draft White Paper has been discussed by theCommittee on a number of occasions and this draft embodies changessuggested at their last meeting.   The principal changes made are asfollows:-(l) A contentious paragraph (paragraph 4 in the latest printconsidered by the Ministerial Committee) implying direct criticism of theway the Labour Party pensions scheme was prepared has been dropped.(2)  The last three paragraphs of the Introduction have beenrephrased and rearranged so as to make it clear that, while the Governmentare putting forward carefully matured proposals, they are not adopting a rigid attitude in respect of the details, and any direct reference to legislation has been omitted.(3)  The Table on page 4 showing the outturn of the present scheme now shows the estimates for every five years from 1961/62 (the assumeddate of commencement of the new scheme) up to 1981/82.   A final columnshowing the position in the first year of next century has been omitted astoo remote.   The idea of presentation of this material as a graph in theWhite Paper has been dropped;(4) My colleagues of the Ministerial Committee were anxious toemphasise that an important consideration in putting the scheme on a sound basis was the need to maintain the principle of benefit as of right.This thought is adequately developed in paragraph 26 where it forms the culmination of an argued passage, and in the light of this it has seemedbetter in the passage immediately after the table of figures to point the moral succinctly that the scheme must be placed on a sound footing.(5) The section on the Limitation of a System of Flat-rate contributions now omits a passage which my colleagues felt did not assistthe argument, mainly a paragraph (27 in the latest print considered by the ministerial Committee) which was substantially a defence of the level ofa flat-rate contribution introduced by us in January.-1-COPY NO.
(6)  In accordance with the wishes of the Ministerial Committee thelast paragraph of the section on the Problem of Dimensions (Paragraph 34)now emphasises rather more than the earlier draft that the new flat-rateminimum will be lower than the existing flat-rate contribution.   It wasalso thought that the passage about keeping flat-rate benefits under reviewwould come better in this paragraph rather than where it originally-appeared among the Governments proposals (paragraph 61 of the previousprint).   The reference to inflation, included in the corresponding paragraph(paragraph 36) of the last print has been deleted, in accordance with thewishes of the Committee.(7)  Paragraph 45(2) has been amended in the words suggested bythe Ministerial Committee.(8)  The passage on Provision to Prevent Future Deficits (nowparagraph 55) was criticised from the point of view of general drafting by my colleagues and has been revised.   The reference to inflation has been omitted as they wished.(9) A concluding paragraph (paragraph 75) commending theproposals has been added at the request of the Committee.Appendix II.   Financial Estimates of Proposals3       After consultation with the Treasury and the Government Actuary,certain changes have been made in the Table, which estimates the finances of the proposals (Appendix II).   In this connection there is an important point to which I ought to invite the Cabinefs attention.   The five-yearlyaverages of surplus or deficit on the working of the new scheme which areprinted at the bottom of Appendix II indicate in the first three quinquennia,though not later, average deficits which are somewhat larger than is consistent with the presentation of the scheme as one which puts the finances of the scheme on a sound foundation.   If however the first quin-quennial increase were advanced by only one year - i. e. from 1966 to 1965the figures would be:-  millionsAverage annualexcess (-f) or deficit (-) of income overexpenditure1961/66       1966/71     1971/76     1976/81     1981/86-6-2-3-1144 64.      These figures would certainly give a better picture;  but such achange would involve some presentational disadvantage in that theseunpopular increases would take effect earlier. I have suggested to theFinancial Secretary that this difficulty would be lessened if these quin-quennial increases were also to apply to the Exchequer contribution - acourse which I myself think would materially help the successfulpresentation of the whole scheme.   The Financial Secretary understandablyfeels that this is a matter which he must reserve for the consideration ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and I would hope to discuss it with himon his return.   Such discussions, however, cannot be in time to affect the presentation of the matter in the White Paper.-2-
5.     In all the circumstances my own view is that on balance we shouldbe wise for the purposes of the White Paper to advance the year of the first of such increases from 1966 to 1965.6.     Subject to the above, I invite the Cabinet to approve the White paper for publication.   The date suggested by the Ministerial Committee is14th October.J.A.B.-C.Ministry of Pensions and national Insurance, W.C.2.22nd September, 1958-3-

PROVISION FOR OLD AGE-THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OFTHE NATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEMEIntroduction1. Her Majesty&apos;s Governments study of the wider problems of provisionfor old age has now reached the point at which the Government are readyto put forward their views to the country and to state the lines on which theyconsider future development should be based.2. How best to make proper provision for the old is one of the biggestsocial problems of our time. Its importance and its difficulty are alikeincreased in a community such as ours in which the proportion of olderpeople has risen and is going to rise. It is vital, too, in considering public policy on this subject, to ensure that state action does not undermine the personal responsibility of each of us to make such provision as we can forour own old age.3. It is indeed one of the most encouraging features of the presentposition that many people and an increasing proportion have rights and obligations in respect of pensions over and above their rights and obligations under the state scheme of National Insurance. But nearly all of us. havingrights under the system of National Insurance, have made our plans on thebasis of the existing scheme.4. Much new evidence, showing profound changes in our social andeconomic structure, has become available since the present scheme of national insurance was prepared. The Report by Lord Beveridge, from which thepresent scheme took its shape, had to be based on a projection of the stateof the nation as it was before the war. To take one obvious example, nocensus figures later than those of 1931 were then available. Since the war,the whole economic climate has altered. A high and stable level of employ-ment is not only a generally accepted object of national policy, but has been attained to an extent which it would have been bold to expect in 1946. Thegeneral standard of living is higher than any cautious person considering thestate of affairs during or immediately after the war could have dared to hope.5. The Committee on the Economic and Financial Problems of theProvision for Old Age (the Phillips Committee), who reported in 1954 (Cmd.9333), provided a valuable interim survey, but they too were hampered bylack of information on vital developments, particularly those relating tooccupational pension schemes. The National Advisory Committee on theEmployment of Older Men and Women have also drawn attention to theseigaps in our knowledge. Considerable progress has now been made in fillingithese gaps. On behalf of the Government, the Government Actuary hasCarried out a survey of occupational pension schemes in private industry and commerce, the results of which were published in May this year. This gives,for the first time, the salient facts about the remarkable advances which havebeen made in this field in recent years.6. Adequate information on these issues takes time to collect and to assess. It would have been a mistake, in the Governments view, for them.to attempt to form judgments until this had been done. This approach hasalso enabled the Government to have the benefit of preliminary views from anumber of sources on some of the problems involved.
7. In the light of the information which is now available, the government think it right to set out their views on the position and the principles whichshould govern further action. These are contained in Part I. In Part II theGovernment put forward certain proposals constructed on those principles.8. It is the Governments wish that ail affected, and particularly those concerned with the administrative problems which changes of this sort in thenational scheme involve for industry, should have the opportunity to express their views before the details of the scheme are fixed.RT I.-THE PRESENT POSITION AND THE FOUNDATIONS for future development the National scheme. Since the inception of contributory state pensions in 1926, it hasbeen generally agreed social policy that there should be, within the resources available, a national contributory insurance scheme providing a pension forthe old, free of means test. Since the war it has become a natural aspirationthat with increases in national wealth the purchasing power of this income which old people receive as of right through the state should not only bemaintained but should be increased in real terms as opportunity permits.Since that time pensions in payment have in fact been increased on fiveoccasions and the weekly rates of 50s. (single) and 80s. (married) introduced at the end- of January diis year represented higher real values than ever before.10. The national contributory pension has always been, in principle, a flat-rate payment, as a return for the payment of flat-rate contributions. Since1948 this pension has been combined with the other benefits of national insurance into a single scheme, and contribution for it has been compulsoryfor nearly everyone of working age, except married women, and for employers.These contributions have been supplemented by an Exchequer contribution,which now amounts to about  125 millions a year.11. Benefits are linked to contributions and each rise in the rate ofbenefit has had to be accompanied by a rise in the rate of contribution. Those,however, who are already pensioners receive the increased rates although theyhave paid no more contributions: and indeed, the great majority of contributorshave, at each increase, some improvement in their prospective rights for which,from an insurance point of view, they never pay in full. In point of fact, a married man in respect of whom full contributions have been paid since 1926will, if he retires this year and his wife is five years younger than himself,receive with his wife pension to the capital value of  2,650, while thecontributions for this pension made by him, and his employers, accumulatedat compound interest, will have amounted to no more than  200. Putanother way, for pensions of 80s. a week put into payment to-day, contri-butions could have been paid for only about 6s. a week at most.12. The burden of liability in respect of pensions for which inadequatecontributions have been paid is not the only adverse factor in the futureoutlook for the scheme. The structure of our population is such that formany years to come the number of people over pension age will increase muchmore rapidly than the number of contributors. In simple demographic terms,in 1911 only one person in 15 of the population was a man over 65 or a woman over 60. To-day it is one in seven. In. 1979 it is expected to be nearly one in five.353805 c*
13. The&apos; scheme is thus faced with a very large uncovered liability infuture years for which no adequate income is provided by the scheme as it stands. This year for the first time a deficiency will be incurred for, which^ithas been necessary to make provision in the Estimates of  14 millions inaddition to the regular Exchequer contribution. It is estimated however that within the next decade this deficiency will reach  260 millions a year and in about 20 years&apos; time will exceed  400 millions a year. These sums are ofcourse additional to the regular Exchequer supplements. The position isshown more fully in the following table prepared by the government actuary:  Estimates of Future Income and Expenditure of the National InsurantFund, with Contributions and Benefits on the Present Basis*  millions	1961-62	1966-67	1971-72	1976-77	1981-82Income  Contributions of insured persons and employers	698	710	714	718	723Exchequer supplements	124	126	126	127	128Interest         ......	50	50	50	50	50Total income	872	886	890	-  895	901Expenditure  Retirement pensions ...	685	768	862	940	990Other benefits......	298	312	311	309	306Administration	33	33	33	33	33Total   expenditure	1,016	1,113	1,206	1,282	1,329Excess of expenditure over income	144	227	316	387	428* For the purpose of the above estimates unemployment has been assumed at anaverage level of 3 per cent, instead of the 4 per csnt. assumed in recent years for the purposeof long term forecasts in relation to the National Insurance scheme.14. In face of this prospect, it is clear that the National Insurancescheme, on which pensioners rely for their benefits as of right, must be placedon a sounder footing.Occupational Schemes: a National Asset15. The movement towards occupational pension provision has been oneof the major features of post-war industrial society. In 1936 only just over\\ million people outside the public services were in pension schemes con-nected with their work, which was usually of a traditionally permanent kind,such as the railways, the supply of electricity or gas, banking and insurance.16. The survey of occupational pension schemes recently published bythe Government Actuary, which is the first such enquiry for twenty-two years,shows that early this year there were about 6J million people in industry and commerce who belonged to pension schemes, or 5 million more than in 1936.This is apart from pensionable employees in the public services and localgovernment.   Including these, the total membership (excluding pensioners)
of pension schemes other than the universal National Insurance schemeapproaches 9 millions, or more than one-third of the total working population.Of men, nearly one half of the total employed belong to such schemes. Oneof the most encouraging features of this impressive development is the progressive extension of coverage from managerial and clerical to manual workers.17. The growth of occupational pension provision has no doubt been encouraged by the tax reliefs which have long been accorded to contributionsmade both by employers and by employees. It has sometimes been suggestedthat the relief so given to contributions for pensions made by employers inLf-ime way represents a &quot; subsidy &quot; from the public, but this relief is in fact jjr more than an allowance for tax purposes of a business expense, of thesame kind as the allowance given in respect of wages.18. These schemes, whether contributory or, as in some cases, paid forentirely by employers, exhibit considerable diversity, but they have threefeatures in common:  (1) They provide cover which is more closely adapted to the individual and his employment than any universal scheme can be.(2) They offer an improved standard of living in old age for an increasingsection of the population.(3) Their funds form a major part of national savings for investment, andthus help to create the real assets on which the future standard ofliving of the old must depend.19. It is clear that occupational schemes now form an integral part bothof the economy and of provision for old age for which allowance must bemade in any development of the state scheme.20. In recent years there has been an increasing movement, both in industry and in professional insurance circles, towards the idea that pension rights in occupational schemes should not be lost on change of employment.It is important from the national point of view that such schemes shouldnot prevent that degree of mobility of labour -and equitable treatment onchange of work which is needed in a healthy and expanding economy. Itis also desirable that contributions set aside for an mdividual&apos;s old age should remain saved for that object, and not be dissipated on a change of employment.The Phillips Committee noted this, and while not feeling in a position torecommend compulsion, considered that &quot; with the continued growth ofpension schemes, the time may not be far distant when the idea of generaltransferability or the provision of 4 paid-up&apos; pensions will come to be widelyacceptable.&quot; The Government, while recognising the difficulties, welcome the further development in this direction which is taking place.Taxation Concessions in Old Age21. Government policy has followed a systematic pattern of lighteningthe tax burden on the old. Thus, improvements have been made in the&quot; age relief &quot; which gives the equivalent of the earned income relief on the investment income of a taxpayer who (or whose wife) is aged 65 or over and whose total income does not exceed a prescribed limit; in 1951 the limit was 500 but it was raised to  600 in 1953 and to  700 in 1957, and this year ithas been raised to  800.22. In addition, a special relief was introduced last year (the &quot; ageexemption&quot;) to help elderly people living on the smallest incomes; this553805 c* 2
24. A social problem of considerable importance arises in this connecti^ tThe limitations of the present system are not generally of much significanceto the higher paid worker if in addition to his rights under the national scheme he is obtaining further pension rights in an occupational scheme. Butdespite the encouraging growth in these schemes in recent years two-thirds ofthe workers in industry (and half the men) are not covered by any such scheme,and for a number of these it seems unlikely that such provision will be made through private schemes, at any rate for some time to come.25. The principle of a flat-rate contribution has stood the test of publicopinion under many different kinds of stress for nearly half a century, andhas the great practical advantages of familiarity and administrative simplicity.But the equal incidence of a flat-rate contribution on all kinds of employment(e.g., whole-time and part-time, high paid and low paid), which is generally acceptable when the rate of contribution is low, becomes open to criticismwhen the rate has to be increased.26. To leave the scheme dependent on rapidly growing subsidies fromgeneral taxation would amount to drawing a blank cheque on the future.It would also undermine the protection given to the individual by the factthat the benefits he receives depend on the contributions he personally makes.The Government have no hesitation in rejecting a system of pension benefitspredominantly financed from taxation, even as a temporary expedient, asdangerous in itself, and likely to be unacceptable to the people as a whole.A System of Graduated Contributions and Pensions27. The difficulties set out in the preceding paragraphs make it clearthat social and financial considerations alike point the need for a new andbold step away from the universal fiat-rate system. It is evident that a sound system which takes account of varying standards and capacity to payrequires that contributions and pensions should vary according to earnings.28. A system of graduated employer/employee contributions to thestate scheme, related in some degree to earnings, and carrying in due courseadditions to the standard National Insurance retirement pension related tothe amount of these contributions built up over the years, would institute ameasure of wage-related pension provision for those for whom, for one reason or another, suitable occupational pension provision was not available.29. Overall, the increased contribution revenue made possible bygraduated contributions could secure that the large emerging deficits withwhich the scheme is at present faced would be eliminated for many years tocome, and the Exchequers share of the cost, while remaining substantial,would be properly defined, and laid down for all to see.30. For all these reasons, the Government consider it necessary to intro-duce some graduation of contributions and pensions, within prescribed limitsaccording to earnings.exempted from tax single persons age 65 or over with a total income notexceeding  250 and married couples where either the husband or the wife is65 or over and their total income does not exceed  400. These income limitshave been increased this year to  275 and  440.The Limitations of a System of Flat-rate Contributions23. The above analysis of the present position brings out strikingly the limitations of a flat-rate system. The developing needs of the old in a community enjoying rising standards of life cannot be adequately met by contributions which have to be fixed at a level all can afford to pay. The speed of the convoy is that of the slowest ship.
31. No financial arrangement will of itself ensure that the resourcesneeded for pensions are forthcoming at the right time. This is a matter for national achievement, through expansion of the economy and, thus of thenation&apos;s wealth. Without the prospect of steady economic advance the outlook for the increasing pensioner population would be grave indeed. But theGovernment, firmly confident in the strength and expansion of the British economy, feel fully justified in bringing to the support of the pensions schemesome of the proceeds, measured in terms of the national wages bill, of thatexpansion. In a buoyant and expanding economy contributions related to earnings will expand, and so make additional resources available to meetthe growing pensions bill. . However, the provision made for the old depends^eo the extent to which the remainder of the community is prepared to see4^)yources allocated to this end and to accept the corresponding limiting ofTneir own level of consumption which is necessary if costs and prices arenot to be driven up.The Problem of Dimensions32. The Government believe that it would not be right to force everyoneto contribute more through a state scheme than would be needed for areasonable provision for their old age. For the state to go further would beto arrogate to itself the individuals right to dispose of his income in what he thinks the right way, and would seriously undermine the individual^ sense of responsibility for his own affairs. Thus the first question to be answeredabout a state graduated scheme is, what should be its dimensions? ; On whatrange of earnings should, the graduated contributions operate, giving whatminimum and maximum contributions, and what additional pension rights?These questions of dimension are, in the Governments view, critical tothe success of a state scheme of graduated pensions and contributions.33. In particular, an excessive extension of the state pension scheme byway of graduation could do grave damage to existing occupational pension schemes and future developments in this field. For although the Government,as explained later, believe that some provision would have to be made for contracting out of the state graduated pension scheme in respect of occupational pension schemes which satisfied specified conditions, it iscertainly no part of the Governments policy to face those concerned withthe bare choice between abandoning their schemes and contracting out, whichwould be posed by a state scheme that had been made on too ambitious lines.34. Embodied in the graduated scale there would need to be a minimumcontribution. This would have to be high enough to form a solid contribu-tion towards the financing of the standard, rates of benefit, the provision ofwhich the Government continue to regard as the prime purpose of theNational Insurance scheme, and which they will, of course, keep under review.The principle of graduation would, however, permit this minimum contribu-tion to be materially lower than the existing flat-rate, thus relieving thelower wage earner of some of the burden he has to carry at present.The Role of the Taxpayers Contribution35. It has always been a feature of our national scheme of pensionsinsurance that it should be supported not only by the contributions of insuredpersons and their employers, but by contributions from general taxation also.The justification for an Exchequer contribution to National Insurance benefitsrests on the fact that without it the lower paid worker cannot, even with the aid of his employer, provide himself with an adequate pension. The needfor such help from general taxation diminishes as the employee&apos;s earnings
increase. The introduction of contributions graduated according to earnings would make it possible to concentrate the Exchequer contribution where it is most needed.The Self-Employed36. The position of the self-employed requires separate consideration.On the one hand the national scheme cannot offer them the advantage of anemployees contribution, and the value to them of a graduated system is forthat reason very much less than it is to employed people. On the other handimproved opportunities are now open to them, under the Finance Act; 1956,to make their own arrangements for old age over and above what is provided under the flat rate National Insurance scheme. There would, further,/ywvery great practical difficulties in assessing and collecting graduait-.contributions from the self-employed. The Government therefore do notconsider that graduation should apply to them.Women37. Notwithstanding that women qualify for pension five years earlier than men and live longer, the present flat-rate contribution for women islower than that for men, partly because the cost of dependency benefit(including wives&apos; and widows&apos; pensions) falls mainly on the men&apos;s contribution.In any scheme providing for an element of graduation in the retirement pension, it is clearly right that- women should qualify for it strictly on theirown graduated contributions, and that the amount should be the same for married and single women. The scale of pension for women should, however,be somewhat lower than the scale for men, because women, on-average, draw their pensions for a longer time than do men (for 18J years from age 60 asagainst nearly 12 years from age 65 for a man) and because their contributinglife is shorter.Relationship of the State Scheme to Occupational Pension Schemes38. The Government are convinced that changes in the field of national insurance should be so framed as not to prevent the vigorous development of independent provision for old age, whether through occupational schemesor otherwise. Here the Government have in mind not only the valuablerights of members of existing schemes, but the future possibilities ofdevelopment in this field. Moreover, such schemes constitute an importantchannel for the nation&apos;s savings and so provide a most valuable source of funds for investment.39. The Government thus attach very great importance to the continueddevelopment of occupational pension schemes, whose social and economic value to the community is so considerable. In the nature of things any development of state pensions must have its repercussions on these schemes.Very careful study has therefore been given to the problem of their relation-ship to a new national scheme.40. The principle of universality is now accepted in respect of the presentNational Insurance flat-rate benefits. But in going beyond this andintroducing a measure of graduated contributions and pension benefits itwould be no part of the Governments intention to compel state provision ofthis sort in cases where adequate provision is already made.41. After careful examination the Government have come to theconclusion that an option in respect of members of occupational pension schemes to contract out of the additional contributory graduated pension ofthe state scheme should be permitted, provided 
(a) that the occupational scheme made provision for pension benefit rightsequivalent to the maximum additional pension rights which would,      be forgone under the state scheme as a result of contracting out;(b) that adequate provision was made for preservation of pension rightsup to, but not necessarily beyond, the pension rights required tosatisfy criterion (a) above, if the employee ceased to be a member ofthe scheme (e.g., on change of job); and(c) that the occupational scheme was financially sound.42. Those, however, who were contracted out on the above conditions would have to continue to pay their fair share of the cost of the flat-ratepension. Although, for the reasons already explained, the placing of the stateinvasion scheme on a graduated basis allows the Exchequer support of theVffleme to be concentrated more effectively on the maintenance of the benefits of the lower wage earner, whose contribution can therefore be reduced fromthe present levels, those who have substantial occupational cover will inmany cases have earnings which, if they were not contracted out of the graduated scheme, would make them liable for higher contributions thanthe present ones. They will also be assured, by the conditions for contracting out, of an addition to the flat-rate pension at least equal to the maximum rate they could have earned in the state scheme. It is clear, therefore, thattheir contributions to the state scheme, though necessarily at flat-rates, must bemaintained at least at the present level.43. It would be for those concerned with occupational schemes toconsider whether to contract out under the conditions proposed, to maintain their scheme unchanged and not contract out, or to make some adjustments to their scheme to take account of the new and enlarged state provision. Inthe Governments view it would be necessary for powers to be taken, as wasthe case in the National Insurance Act, 1946, to facilitate the adjustment ofschemes in accordance with the decisions taken in respect of them. TheGovernment are of the opinion that the application to contract out must comeformally from the employer. For it is the employer who assumes vis-a-vis thestate the obligations involved in a decision to contract out and it is upon him that there falls the initial responsibility for paying whatever may be theappropriate contributions to the state scheme. Since, however, occupational schemes play an important part in good industrial relations the Governmentare of the view that no employer would be well advised or likely to make anapplication to contract out against the wishes of any substantial number of hisemployees. Even if he were to do so, the provisions outlined above in respectof preservation of rights and equivalency would have the effect of securing that no employee who was a member of a contracted-out scheme would be ina less favourable pension position than if he had remained in the state scheme at the maximum rate.44. The Government have, none the less, given careful consideration tothe view expressed in certain quarters that the option to contract out shouldbe on an individual rather than a group basis. Great practical difficultiesfrom the point of view both of the administration of the occupational schemeand the enforcement of proper contributions to the state scheme would be involved in any such individual option, and the Government have noted thatan individual option to stand out of changes made under the rules of occupational schemes is very rarely provided. Further, such an option, if itwere to be of value, might require to be exercised on a number of occasionsas circumstances changed, and additional complications would arise. Thebest safeguard for the individual is the provision outlined above under whicha decision to contract out cannot prejudice an individual^ pension position ascompared with that in which he would be under the state scheme.   In
addition the Government consider that the employer who makes an applicationto contract out should be under a statutory obligation to give a prescribed period of advance notice of his application, so as to make sure that fhertjis an opportunity for normal processes of consultation to operate.PART II.-THE GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALS45. The proposals which the Government now put forward have,therefore, the following objectives:  (1) To place the National Insurance scheme on a sound financial basis.(2) To institute provision for employed persons who cannot be coveredby an appropriate occupational scheme to obtain some measure Mpension related to their earnings. &quot;(3) To preserve and encourage the best development of occupational pension schemes.Graduated Contributions for Employed Persons46. The Government propose that, subject to a minimum weekly contri-bution (somewhat lower than the present fiat-rate contributions) whichwould include the separate National Health Service contribution, the national insurance contributions of employed persons, other than those contracted out as members of occupational pension schemes (as to whom, see below) shouldbe based on a percentage of a certain range of earnings. The percentageproposed is 8  per cent, (paid jointly by employer and employee) for bothmen and women. This would be applied to the range of earnings between 9 and  15 a week. There would be a system of graduated additions to pension related to the graduated contributions.47. The total combined minimum weekly contribution for an employedman not contracted out would correspond to 8  per cent, of  9 a week;that is 15s. 4d. a week. For women the minimum weekly contribution wouldbe fixed at a lower figure taking account of the lower contribution for women to the National Health Service and the Industrial Injuries scheme, and thefact that a woman&apos;s National Insurance cover, unlike a man&apos;s, does not haveto include, for example, widows&apos; benefit and dependency increases for the wife. For women, therefore, the minimum contribution would be fixed at13s. 6d. a week. Above these figures of 15s. 4d. and 13s. 6d. the contributions will increase with earnings up to a maximum. The maximum combinedtotal contribution for an employed man not contracted out, which will be payable by him and his employer jointly on earnings of  15 a week or more,will be 25s. 6d., and for an employed woman 23s. 8d.48. Throughout the history of National Insurance, contributions paid for employed persons have been &quot;shared roughly equally between the employer and the employee. The Government are satisfied that this is the rightprinciple and one that should be maintained in the payment of graduated contributions. The total minimum weekly contribution will accordinglyinclude insurance contributions so divided between employer and employeetowards the flat-rate National Insurance and Industrial Injuries benefits.49. The contribution towards the National Health Service a total of. 4d. for an employed man and Is. lOd. for an employed woman whichis also included in the combined minimum weekly contribution, will remaindivided between employer and employee in the way settled by Parliamentearlier this year, i.e., the employer paying 5 d. in each case. This contribution is now quite distinct from the National Insurance contribution, as is made clear
on the joint stamp used for National Insurance cards, and it will remaindistinct under the new scheme, the money raised going not to the national insurance Fund but towards the cost of the National Health Service. Itwill, however, continue for convenience to be collected with the national insurance contribution.50. The combined minimum contribution of 15s. 4d. for an employedman will thus be divided into an employees share of 7s. and an employee^share of 8s. 4d. For women the employees share will be 6s. 4d. and the employee^ 7s. 2d. These minimum contributions compare with the presentfiat-rate of 18s. 2d. a week for men (8s. 3d. employer and 9s. lid. employee),and 14s. 9d. a week for women (6s. 9d. employer and 8s. employee). Creditsjjk* these minimum contributions during periods of unemployment, incapacity,W!!., will be given on the same basis as at present for the purpose of the flat-rate benefits, including the present retirement pension.51. The graduated contributions payable on earnings between  9 and  15a week, divided equally between employer and employee, will in due coursegive entitlement to graduated additions to retirement pension (includingretirement pensions of widows on their husband&apos;s insurance). Since thesecontributions will be entirely related to actual earnings, the rules as to creditsduring periods of interruption of employment will not apply to them.Examples of the new contributions are given in Appendix I.Flat-rate Contributions for Other Groups of Insured Persons52. Persons contracted out and their employers will continue to pay contributions at the rates which at present are applicable to employed persons.53. Flat-rate contributions will continue as at present for the self-employed and non-employed.54. Young persons up to 18 who are employed will not be liable forthe graduated contributions. They and their employers will pay contributionsat the same rates as those now payable.Provision to Prevent Future Deficits55. The system of contributions proposed will provide a buoyant, ratherthan a static, source of income for the Fund, since it will yield more as national earnings rise. But the growth of income from this source will not,on any prudent assumptions, keep pace with the growth in the cost ofpensions, and, after the first few years, some increase in contribution rates will be necessary. The necessity for such an increase could be avoided byfixing higher contributions from the outset of the scheme, which wouldresult in a substantial surplus to begin with, the interest on which, togetherwith the continuing extra income from the higher contributions, would cover the increasing out-go on pensions. The future cost of pensions can, however,only be met out of current production at the time, and the building up ofbalances in the National Insurance Funds would not of itself ease the realburden on the contributing population in the future. The imposition of higher rates of contribution than are necessary to cover current out-go would,to the extent that it diminished the volume of private savings, add nothing to the growth of national capital and productivity, on which the nation&apos;disability to sustain the future burden of pensions depends, and could even retarcfit. The Government, therefore, have preferred to limit the contributionsinitially to the levels proposed above, but to provide at the outset for increases in all the rates of contribution to take effect at five-yearly intervals during thefirst twenty years for the purpose of meeting the deficits on the flat-rate
Contributions of Married Women and Widow Beneficiaries57. Married women and widow beneficiaries will be able, on the same basis as at present, to elect not to pay their own share of the minimum orflat-rate contributions, other than Industrial Injuries contributions. If,however, their earnings are above  9 a week they will be required (unlesscontracted out as members of an occupational pension scheme), to pay their share of the appropriate graduated contribution on earnings above that figure.Assessment and Collection of Contributions58. The minimum and flat-rate contributions will be a weekly liability,as at present. The hability for graduated contributions will be assessed inrelation to earnings paid in the week, month or other pay period, and thecontributions will be due at the time the earnings are paid. Special rules maybe necessary for those who receive their earnings in notably unequalinstalments. It would be practicable for the main system of collection forthe flat-rate, as well as the minimum and graduated contributions, to be onthe lines of P.A.Y.E., but cards and stamps or other existing methods of collection will have to be retained for certain categories, including the self-employed and the non-employed. The Government intend to enter intodetailed discussion of the technical problems with representatives of those concerned as soon as possible.Flat-rate Benefits59. AH insured persons will remain covered for the fiat-rate benefits(including the flat-rate retirement pension) of the existing National insurance and Industrial Injuries schemes as at present. Employed persons paying thenew graduated contributions, whether at the minimum rate or above, willbe covered for these benefits in return for their contributions. Persons notpaying the graduated contributions, either because they are contracted out as members of occupational schemes, or because they are self-employed ornon-employed, will be covered as at present, by their fiat-rate contributions.Graduated Pensions        -60. The graduated contributions paid on earnings above  9 a week willalso count in due course towards a graduated retirement pension. the graduated pension will be payable, subject to retirement and an earnings rule,at age 65 (60 for women) or subsequently, prom age 70 (65 for women)it will be paid without an earnings rule and irrespective of retirement.pension as they emerge. This follows the precedent of the original Contribu-tory Pensions Act, which&apos; provided for a series of decennial increases, andof the National Insurance Act, 1946, which provided for the contributions to be increased five years after the new pension rates came into payment.The increases proposed are of i per cent, a side of earnings to whichgraduated contributions are related, giving four increases of 5d. a side in theminimum contribution and of 9d. a side in the maximum contribution.- 56. There will be similar provision to increase the flat-rate contributions,like the graduated contributions, every five years for the first twenty years ofthe scheme, for the purpose of avoiding deficts which would otherwise arise onthe cost of the fiat-rate pensions. Thus the fiat-rate contributions for aj*employed man who is contracted out will be subject to four increases of 9df&apos;side.
. . .61. The weekly rate of the graduated element in the combined, pensionyyill be related to the total graduated contributions, paid.; In ,the Govern-menfs view, the most appropriate basis is the system (frequently&quot; drnpjoyedin. the field of occupational pensions) by-which, all graduated, contributions paid before pension age count equally towards pension rights without.regardto-the contributors age when they were paid. This system is of advantage to those who enter the graduated scheme late in life-as many will do whenthe scheme begins... Graduated contributions will ,thus build up on an equalbasis, like bricks in a wall, to give an addition to the-standard retirement pension proportionate to the average weekly earnings between  9 and  15jpn which graduated contributions have been paid and the period over whichjmfeey have been paid. ...62. Each  1 of graduated contributions paid by the insured person(together with the matching contribution by his employer but excluding the quinquennial increases referred to earlier) will.. constitute a unit.. TheGovernment propose that every 15 such units should provide a malecontributor with Is. a week  2 12s. a year pension at the age of 65. ThusIs. a week each side in graduated contributions paid for just under six years will accumulate Is. a week additional pension at 65. A man consistentlyearning  15 a week or more would accumulate in a little over a year Is. a week,to be added to his standard pension. This would give such a man&quot;-who retired at 65 a total pension of 60s. a week (single) or 90s. a week (married)if he entered the scheme at the age of 53, and 70s. a week or 100s. a week,as the case may be, if he entered at age 42. A man consistently;-earning 12 a week would accumulate additional pension, at half the above rate,which would give him on retirement at age 65 a total pension of. 55s. a week(single) or 85s. a week (married) if he entered the scheme at age 53. and 60s.or 90s. a week respectively if he entered at age 42.63. For women the appropriate rate of addition per unit will be lowerfor the reasons explained earlier, and it is proposed that 18 units of graduated contributions paid should earn Is. a week additional pension at. age 60. a woman who enters the scheme at age 46 and pays contributions on earnings of  15 a week until she is 60 will thus qualify for an addition of 10s. a week to such other pension as she may have. Such a woman with the standard rate of pension could therefore earn a total of 60s. a week. Fuller examples of the benefits for various ages of entry and earnings records for both sexesare given in Appendix I.64. The widow of a man who has been receiving a graduated retirement pension or has paid graduated contributions will receive an addition to herretirement pension (whether the pension is paid on her own or. her husband&apos;sinsurance) equal to half the graduated pension which the husband. was receiving or had earned whilst alive. This addition to. her pension will bepaid on top of any graduated pension which the widow has earned by her own contributions. If she is widowed when under 60 she will, until shequalifies for retirement pension, receive any flat-rate widow&apos;? benefit she maybe entitled to under the existing arrangements, which will continue.65. For people who postpone retirement beyond minimumipensipn.ageadditional graduated pension will be earned in respect of both the graduated contributions paid after! minimum pension age and the graduated pensionforgone. , .&apos;, -&quot;&apos; 66. For those who pay graduated contributions for only a short period--for example, people who retire soon after the scheme begins-^the resulting
graduated benefit rights may be too small to be conveniently discharged byway of a weekly pension. In such cases provision may therefore be needed for an appropriate lump sum payment to be made instead. *Contracting Out67. A primary condition of contracting out in respect of employees whoare members of occupational pension schemes will be that the schemesconcerned are constituted under statute, trust, or inalienable policies of insurance, and that the pension benefits which they provide are on the wholeas favourable as the maximum graduated pension rights of the new state scheme that is, that the occupational scheme provides pension rightscorresponding to the additional graduated rights conferred by the state schegfovon an employee for whom contributions are paid on earnings of  15 a we&quot;.&apos;68, In order to ensure that these pension rights, in respect of whichcontracting out has been permitted, are not lost either on change of employ-ment or on cessation of the occupational scheme, employers of personscontracted out will be subject to a further requirement. This will be satisfiedif it is shown when the employee ceases to be in a contracted-out scheme that pension rights at least equivalent to the additional graduated rights which could have been earned under the state scheme by contributions atthe maximum rate over the period the employee was contracted out, aresatisfactorily secured to him on attainment of minimum pension age forinstance, by way of a frozen pension in the occupational scheme payable atan age not later than 65 (60 for women). Otherwise the employer will be under a statutory liability to pay an appropriate amount into the national insurance Fund, to acquire maximum graduated rights for the employee inthe state scheme in respect of his period of contracted out employment. Indischarging this liability the employer will be entitled to recover up to halfthe amount required from any contributions under the occupational schemewhich would otherwise be returnable to the employee. The employee willbe credited for pension purposes in the National Insurance scheme as if,&quot;throughout the period during which he was contracted out, he and his employer had paid graduated contributions at the highest rate.69. Evidence will be required of the financial soundness of schemes inrespect of which applications for contracting out are made, and of continuedsatisfaction of the conditions. In the case of statutory schemes, or thoseinsured with Life Offices (which are subject to supervision by the Board ofTrade), further evidence on financial soundness would not normally be needed. In other cases, periodical information about the finances of thescheme, such as a certificate from an actuary, would usually be required.70. As explained earlier the application for contracting out will comefrom the employer or authority concerned, who will be under a stautory obligation to give a prescribed period of advance notice of the application toall affected by it, including the trustees of the scheme, if any. The applicationwill be submitted to a registrar appointed for the purpose, whose duty it willbe to grant a Certificate of Exception defining the persons contracted out ifhe is satisfied that the employees described in the application are covered inaccordance with the foregoing paragraphs. The Certificate will be on thelines of those granted under the 1925 Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos; and Old AgeContributory Pensions Act.** A Certificate of Exception was given under Section 9 (1) (iv) of the Widows&apos;, Orphans&apos;and Old Age Contributory Pensions Act, 1925, in respect of certain superannuate employ-ments subject to conditions. The certificate gave definitions of groups of employees fromwhich it was possible to identify any individual employee as covered by the certificate for thepurpose of assessing his liability to contributions.
Exchequer Contribution to the Scheme, 71. Exchequer support of the scheme will take the form of an annual contribution, which has been placed at  170 millions. Overall this sum is rather greater than one-quarter of the Fund&apos;s income from the minimumcontributions, and assumes that the Exchequer will continue to pay, in respectof the self-employed and non-employed, the equivalent of one-third of theirweekly contribution. In the case of employed persons, the exchequer contribution to the Fund, when combined with the Exchequer contributionto the Industrial Injuries Fund, which will continue on its present -basis,would correspond to 2 per cent, of the weekly earnings of  9 to which theirminimum contribution is related. ihire Financial Position of the Scheme72. Tables prepared by the Government Actuary showing the estimatedfinancial position in future years of a scheme based on these proposals aregiven in Appendix II.Modification of Schemes73. To assist those responsible for existing schemes to modify them as necessary to take account of the new situation, provision will be made forfacilitating the modification of schemes on an application being made to an appropriate authority specified in the legislation. The facilities will beavailable both for schemes for which it is not proposed to apply for contracting out and for those which wish to seek adaptation to enable theconditions for contracting out to be satisfied.Date of Commencement -74. The changeover to the new system will involve a very great amountof detailed technical replanning by both employers and the GdvernmentDepartments concerned. For this the Government envisage that at least twoyears will be required. Association of the collection of contributions with.A.Y.E. would require that these should become operative from thebeginning of an income tax year. At this stage, before detailed proposals have been submitted to Parliament, the Government cannot indicate thedate at which the new scheme could be brought into operation^ but thisclearly could not be before April 1961. The Government hope, j however,that the machinery for receiving applications to contract out of the graduated contributions, or to modify pension schemes in the light of the changed&quot;situation, will be in operation considerably sooner than this, so; thit thejnew scheme may move off to a smooth start. !    jConclusion t iii::75.! The Government put forward these proposals as ; providing. a framework within which the major problems at present facing the national insurance scheme can be met. They constitute, in &apos;the Governments view,a natural and proper development of the existing scheme in the light of thenation&apos;^ social and economic progress since that scheme was conceived andof the prospects of similar progress in the future. Any improvement in theprovision for the old necessarily enlarges their claim on the national econoihyin the future: the present proposals therefore represent both a1 challenge jtothe nation and: an expression of the Governmenfs confidence that the challenge can and will be met.
