Increases in the school population in Scotland since the war have followed the same general pattern as in England.

But it will not be possible to dispense with uncertificatedteachers or to get rid of all oversize classes - even by the less exactingScottish standards:  this would require 1,600 more teachers than we expect to have.    The improvement of the physical conditions of our-1-
schools which I propose above would be not only a desirable educationaladvance in itself but also a very important contribution towards solving the problem of improving teacher recruitment by removing a real source of dissatisfaction among serving teachers and making teaching a more attractive career.6.     I should be the last to minimise the difficulties of increasing the teaching force sufficiently and quickly enough to achieve all our aims.But we must let it be seen that we are in no less earnest about thesupply of teachers than about school buildings.    In paragraph 5 1 have emphasised the bearing of my proposals on teaching conditions because i am convinced that, if our proposals for a forward drive are allowed togive the impression that wregard the supply of teachers as only anincidental problem, we shall lose much potential support.    some criticism of that kind was made of the White Paper on Technical education in 1956.    It would be much stronger in this context.Technical education7.      The White Paper on Technical Education (February, 1956) was issued at a time when education authorities in Scotland were stillpreoccupied with problems relating to primary and secondary education,and had given less attention to the development of further education than had their counterparts in England.    On the other hand, technical education at the most advanced levels had in the central institutions inScotland been developed to a greater extent than in England and Wales.For this reason our 1956-61 programme was directed mainly towardsdoubling the comparatively small amount of accommodation thenavailable in local technical colleges for day-release courses.    At thesame time we hoped to achieve an increase of about 25 per cent in the accommodation for advanced full-time and sandwich courses.    After1961, because of the comparatively poor position from which we started in 1956, a big programme of local technical college building will still berequired, while the central institutions will need to expand furtherbecause of the larger numbers who will be coming up for advancedcourses.    Subject to more detailed consideration with my colleagues of the contents of such a programme, I should want to aim at continuingcapital expenditure for technical education after 1961 at a level ofabout  2- 2f millions, corresponding to the figure for England of 15 millions.cost.      The proposals made above, together with minor works and othersmaller programmes, would involve an annual rate of capital investmentrising from  10. 75 millions at present to about  14. 5 millions in1961-62 and possibly to about  17 millions eventually.    As in England,current expenditure on education in Scotland will rise in any eventbetween now and 1964 as a result of the developments already in train.On that basis annual expenditure, including loan charges, on primary,secondary and further education would rise from  70 millions in 1958to  87 millions in 1964.    It is estimated that this last figure would beincreased by not more than  1 million as a result of the proposals inthis paper, since their effect would be largely limited to loan charges.-2-
Assuming the present proportions of current expenditure falling on ratesand taxes respectively, the Exchequer share would rise from  47 millions in 1958 to  59 millions in 1964, without a forward drive, and to about 59.5 millions if the drive is undertaken.Publication of White Paper9.     If it is decided to publish a White Paper as suggested by theMinister of Education, I should favour having a single White Paper dealingwith both England and Scotland.    Despite some differences in the educational problems of the two countries, I think it would be undesirable to have two separate Paperr. on a matter of general policy.    A singlePaper would follow the prect lent of the White Paper on technical education.    The. general form of the latter could also be followed - ashort introduction in purely general terms; a series of chapters for england and Wales;   one or two chapters on Scotland;  and a generalconcluding section.J.S.M.Scottish Office, S.
