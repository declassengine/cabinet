confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  September 1958C. (58) 188 Copy No.15th September, 1958CABINETCIVIL AVIATION : FARESMemorandum by the Minister of power the Committee on Civil Aviation Policy, under my Chairmanship, have been examining the desirability of proposing changes in the present structure ofinternational airline fares, as invited by the Cabinet on 10th June (C.C. (58) 47thConclusions, Minute 6). They have concentrated their attention on the proposal that differential fares should be introduced, whereby minimum fares for travelby turbo-propeller aircraft would be lower than those for turbo-jet aircraft.2. The annual traffic conference of the International Air TransportAssociation (I.A.T.A.), beginning on 23rd September, presents the opportunity forany changes in the present fare structure to be proposed. This conference, atwhich the principal airlines of the world are represented, will be attended by the chairmen of British European Airways (B.E.A.) and the British Overseas airways corporation (B.O.A.C.). Through the medium of the conference minimum faresfor air travel are agreed internationally and they rule for the twelve months beginning on the following 1st April.3. The Committee have considered evidence from representatives of certainaircraft and aero-engine manufacturers who are concerned in the production of aircraft powered by turbo-props, and from the Chairmen of B.E.A. and B.O.A.C.Briefly, the manufacturers are more or less strongly in favour of differential faresno doubt because without such a system they see grave difficulties in disposing of sufficient turbo-prop aircraft or engines to enable them to avoid serious financialconsequences: unless operators are allowed to make travel in turbo-prop aircraftcheaper than in turbo-jet aircraft, the public will choose the faster and morecomfortable jets and the market for turbo-props at home and overseas willquickly shrink.4. B.E.A. are also in favour of a fare differential (of about 10 per cent.)on the shorter-haul routes to which their direct interest is confined. They fear that without this they will lose traffic to their competitors as they themselves are committed to operating turbo-props for their main effort until the mid-1960s,when the D.H.121 is due to come into service.5. B.O.A.C. are in a different position. They are chiefly interested in long-haul routes, and they are committed to operating jet aircraft in an increasing proportion: by 1960-61 half of their aircraft capacity will be in the form of jets,by 1961-62 two-thirds and by 1966-67 the whole of it. Any fare differentialagainst jets will seriously prejudice the future results of their policy of attractingmore and more tourist traffic on which they believe that their success depends.6. At the I.A.T.A. conference, therefore, the Chairman of B.E.A. proposesto press for the adoption of a fare differential for travel within Europe. TheChairman of B.O.A.C. will be prepared to support this, but will himself attemptto secure that no differential is adopted for long-haul routes and the Chairmanof B.E.A. will not oppose this.54046
7. The best interests of the manufacturers of turbo-prop and piston-poweredaircraft would require that a fart inferential should apply on long-haul as well asshort-haul routes, for the reasons given in paragraph 3. But there are strong arguments against trying to persuade the Chairman of B.O.A.C. to change his proposed line. First, the Corporation^ own commercial future would in his view be jeopardised by a differential; and secondly it is probable, though necessarilynot certain, that the operating costs of turbo-jet aircraft per seat mile on long-haulroutes will be less than those of turbo-props the opposite of what has often been assumed in the past.8. In any case, decisions at the conference to introduce differential fareswould be required to be unanimous and we are advised that about half of the airlines represented there will be against differentials. There would seem to belittle chance of a differential for long-haul routes being adopted (whatever line the Chairman of B.O.A.C. takes) and possibly a not very much greater chance ofthe arrangement finding favour for short-haul routes. And the number of airlinesfavouring fare differentials will diminish at future annual conferences of theI.A.T.A. as more of them become re-equipped with jets.9. This source of assistance to the aircraft manufacturers concerned seems unlikely to be available therefore and other solutions to their difficulties must besought. These my Committee intend to study as part of their future work.10. My colleagues are agreed, therefore, that the Government should concur in the line (summarised in paragraph 6) that the Chairmen of B.E.A. and B.O.A.C.propose to adopt in relation to differential fares at the forthcoming I.A.T.A.conference. The Committee thought that the Cabinet would wish to be informed of this.M.Ministry of Power, S.W. I,12th September, 1958.
