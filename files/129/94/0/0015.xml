The final meeting of the Ministerial Committee which has been consideringthe main points left open by the Cabinet took place on 24th July, and, as thedecisions then taken affect the form and substance of the White Paper, time hasbeen too short either to consult other Departments on points which may affectthem or to produce a document complete in every respect or particularly mellowin language.

DRAFT WHITE PAPER ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THENATIONAL INSURANCE SCHEMEI.-introduction. Her Majesty&apos;s Governments study of the wider problems of provisionfor old age, which was referred to in the Gracious Speech at the openingof the present Session of Parliament, has now reached the point at which theGovernment considers it appropriate to put forward their appreciation of theposition and certain proposals on which they consider future development should be based.2. Provision for old age is a question of general public concern of theutmost importance to the community as a whole. It is also a personal responsibility of each individual citizen throughout his or her working life.At present most of us have positive obligations and positive rights under thenational system of provision through National Insurance. Many and theyare an increasing proportion have rights and obligations under other formsof provision as well. It is because this question affects every individualspersonal interests and arrangements that the Government considers that itwould be dangerous and wrong to treat it from a partisan point of view or as if some doctrinaire solution could be privately worked out in detail andimposed on the public.3. There is a further reason for a deliberate and careful nationalapproach to the complex questions involved in making provision for old age.This is a matter on which long views are essential. Unless the legislation onthis subject commands the widest possible measure of confidence and assent,the provision on which people rely will be exposed to the constant fluctuationsof political change. It was on such a basis of wide public support, reachedafter deliberate consideration both by expert opinion from all points of view and by the nation as a whole, that the present scheme of National Insurancewas established in 1946. Without such prior examination and acceptanceon a national non-partisan basis, plans for further improvement, howeveringenious, will not operate successfully, and the provision they offer will notform a continuous and reliable feature of our national life.4. Much new evidence, showing profound changes in our social andeconomic structure, has become available since the present scheme ofNational Insurance was prepared. The Report by Lord Beveridge, fromwhich the present scheme took its shape, had to be based on a projectionof the state of the nation as it was before the war. To take one obviousexample, no census figures later than those of 1931 were then available.Since the war, the whole economic climate has altered. Full employment is not only a generally accepted object of national policy, but has been attained to an extent which it would have been bold to expect in 1946. Thegeneral standard of living is higher than any cautious person considering thestate of affairs during or immediately after the war could have dared to hope.5. The Committee on the Economic and Financial Problems of Pro-vision for Old Age (the &quot; Phillips Committee&quot;), which reported in 1954(Cmd. 9333), provided a valuable interim survey, but they too were hampered by lack of information on vital developments, particularly those relating tooccupational pension schemes. The National Advisory Committee on theEmployment of Older Men and Women also drew attention to these gaps inour knowledge.   Considerable progress has now been made in filling these3
II.-THE PRESENT position the National Scheme : an Area of Agreement8. Since 1926, when contributory pensions were first introduced, it hasbeen generally agreed social policy that the old should, within the resources available, be insured under a national contributory scheme providing a pensionfree of means test. Since the war it has become a natural aspiration that withincreases in national wealth the purchasing power of this income which old people receive as of right through the State should not only be maintainedbut should be increased in real terms as opportunity permits. Since that timepensions in payment have in fact been increased on five occasions and the ratesof 50s. (single) and 80s. (married) introduced at the end of January this yearrepresented higher real values than ever before.9. Ever since its introduction the national contributory pension has been,in principle, a flat-rate payment in old age, as a return for the payment offlat-rate contributions. Since 1948 this pension at improving standards hasbeen combined with the other benefits of National Insurance into a singlescheme, and contribution for it has been compulsory for nearly everyone ofworking age except married women.10. The basis of financing this pension has been tripartite, that is tosay, the cost has been shared between individual employers, individual insuredpersons and taxpayers as a whole, through the Exchequer.11.   Originally the basis for fixing the flat-rate contribution was to takethe sum that would produce the benefits if it was paid weekly from the ageof 16 and accumulated at interest.  Benefits have been linked to contributions- and a rise in the rate of benefit has had to be accompanied by a rise in therate of contribution.12.   As, however, benefits have been increased both for those who havealready retired and for those who have contributed at the increased rates fora very short time, contributions on this basis have proved inadequate to-prevent the Fund running into deficit.   Those who are already pensionersgaps. On behalf of the Government, the Government Actuary has carriedout the survey of occupational pension schemes in private industry and commerce, the results of which were published on 13th May this year. this gives us, for the first time, the salient facts about the remarkable advanceswhich have been made in this field in recent years.6.   Adequate information on these issues takes time to collect and^.assess.   It would have been a mistake, in the Governments view, for themto attempt to form even preliminary judgments until this had been done. this approach has also enabled the Government to have the benefit of preliminaryviews from a number of sources on some of the problems involved.7. The Government considers that the way is now open for fruitfuldiscussion of further development. They are therefore putting forward an outline scheme before settling, for incorporation in legislation, the detailedchanges which will represent further improvements in provision for old age.They hope that this method of proceeding will enable consultation to takeplace with those who speak for employers and employed persons and withthose who, as trustees or otherwise, have the responsibility for pension funds,with the aim of making the legislation and the administrative arrangementsfollowing from it as convenient and easy to run as possible for all those whowill be concerned.
receive increased rates although they have paid no more contributions: and indeed everyone over 16 has, at each increase, some improvement in hisprospective rights for which, from an insurance point of view, he never paysin full. In point of fact, a married man in respect of whom full contributions have been paid since 1926 when the Contributory Pensions Scheme began,&quot;&quot;Yill, if he retires this year, and his wife is five years younger than himself.. .t:ceive a pension with a capital value of  2,650, while the&apos; statutorycontributions for pension made by him. and his employers, accumulated atcompound interest, will have amounted to no more than  200. Put another way, for .the pension of 80s. a week put into payment today, contributions have been paid for only 6s. a week.13. The scheme is thus faced with a very large uncovered liability infuture years for which no income is provided by the scheme as it stands. Thecost to the taxpayer of the National Insurance scheme this year will be atleast  140 millions, mostly in the form of the regular Exchequer share ofthe weekly contributions. Within the next decade, however, it is estimated to exceed  400 millions a year, and to approach  600 millions a year in twenty years&apos; time. The bulk of these very large sums will be in the nature of deficitpayments.  The position is shown more fully in the following table:  Tablb estimated Future Receipts and Payments of theNational Insurance FundReceiptsContributions of InsuredPersons and EmployersExchequer Supplements...Interest on ReservesDeficit     .........1959-60 m.PaymentsRetirement PensionsOther BenefitsAdministration m.ReceiptsContributions of InsuredPersons and EmployersExchequer Supplements...Interest on ReservesDeficit    .........1969-70 m.Payments m.Retirement PensionsOther BenefitsAdministrationReceipts m.Contributions of InsuredPersons and EmployersExchequer Supplements...Interest on ReservesDeficit    ...      ......1979-80Payments m.Retirement PensionsOther Benefits    ......Administration    ......
14. That a deficit has not till now appeared in the finances of the scheme,has been partly due to sustained full employment, which has meant lowexpenditure on unemployment benefit, maximum yield of contributions, anda high incidence of postponed retirement from work. Another reason hasbeen that the successive increases in benefit rates have been accompaniedby increases in some cases more than proportionate in the flat-ncontributions.15. The deficit is, however, now with us, and will inevitably have to bemet in ever-growing measure if we continue on the present basis, since thenumber of pensioners will steadily increase, while the number of contributorswill remain about the same. To examine the problem in demographic,instead of financial terms, one person in every five of the population of thiscountry in 1979 is likely to be a man over 65 or a woman over 60. To-dayit is one in seven.  In 1911 it was one in fifteen.16. In face of this prospect, the Government have made it one of their chief objectives to find means of placing the National Insurance scheme ona sounder footing. If the Scheme should degenerate from its contributory basis into a substantially tax-supported system, which would be hard to distinguish from National Assistance, the objective of helping all pensioners tomaintain, and if possible improve, their standards with the march of industrialprogress will be thwarted, and the conception of benefit as of right will be undermined.Occupational Schemes: A National Asset17. The movement towards occupational pension provision has been one of the major features of post-war industrial society. In 1936 only just over 1J million people outside the public services were in pension schemesconnected with their work, which was usually of a traditionally permanentkind, such as the railways, the supply of electricity or gas, banking, and insurance.18. The survey of occupational pension schemes recently published bythe Government Actuary, which is the first such enquiry for twenty-two years,shows that early this year there were about 6J million people in industry and commerce who belonged to pension schemes, or 5 million more than in 1936.This is apart from pensionable employees in the public services and localgovernment. If they are included, the total membership of pension schemesother than the universal National Scheme approaches 9 millions, or morethan one-third of the total working population. Of men, nearly one-half ofthe total employed belong to such schemes. One of the most encouragingfeatures of this impressive development is the progressive extension ofcoverage from managerial and clerical to manual workers.19. This growth of occupational provision has interesting features.Provision by the employer by way of pensions is analogous to the provisionhe makes for current wages, and this is recognised in both forms of paymentbeing counted as expenses of the business for tax purposes. It has beensuggested that the relief so given to contributions for pensions made by employers in some way represents a &quot; subsidy &quot; from the public, but if so itis a form of &quot; subsidy &quot; which is applicable in far greater measure to thecurrent wages of almost all employed persons.20. The employee&apos;s share of a contribution to a pension scheme is alsorelieved, in greater or less measure, from tax, as is the interest income ofmany approved pension funds. It has long been accepted policy in thiscountry that where current income is deferred for old age, the tax on that
income is similarly deferred until the time it is actually drawn. This appliesnot only to occupational pension contributions but to the pension contributions under National Insurance and to premiums paid under arrangements underthe Finance Act, 1956.   While, therefore, it may be said that this form of. raving is favoured by our taxation system, it is certainly not subsidised in theI j,ase that the taxpayer in general assists the saver.21. Possibly no two occupational schemes are exactly the same in theirrules or their benefits. They have grown up to suit particular groups and often represent the outcome of negotiation. In most the employees contributeas well as the employer, but many are paid for entirely by employers. Someprovide fixed benefits, others relate benefits to average salary. Some providepensions of up to two-thirds of working pay, while others aim at only a modest addition to National Insurance and the individual^ own resources.Similarly the rules and conditions of schemes are highly variegated to take account of the circumstances in which each scheme has developed.22.   These schemes, however, have three common features:  (1) They provide cover which is more closely adapted to the individual and his employment than any universal scheme can be.(2) They are pledges of an improved and self-supporting standard ofliving for an increasing section of the population in old age.(3) Their funds form a major part of national saving for investment, andthus help to create the real assets on which the future standard ofliving of the old must depend.23. It is clear that occupational schemes now form so important a feature both of the economy and of provision for old age, that no proposals in the latter field can ignore them. It may be that their development has now reached a stage at which more systematic provisions than those which havehitherto allowed them the maximum freedom of growth should be appliedto them. On the other hand such provisions should not be such that their continued useful growth might be impeded.24. In recent years there has been an increasing movement both in industrial and professional circles towards the idea that pension rights in occupational schemes should not be lost on change of employment. It is indeed important from the national point of view that they should not preventthat degree of mobility of labour and equitable treatment on change of workwhich is needed in a healthy and expanding economy. It is also desirablethat contributions set aside for an individual^ old age, and relieved of tax onthat basis, should remain saved for that object and not be dissipated on achange of employment. The Phillips Committee, reporting in 1954, notedthis, and while not feeling in a position to recommend compulsion, consideredthat &quot; with the continued growth of pension schemes, the time may not be far distant when the idea of general transferability or the provision of&apos; paid up&apos; pensions will come to be widely acceptable.&quot;25. The Government therefore welcomes the developing consciousnessof industry that the far-sighted view is that occupational pension rights shouldbe preserved. On the other hand they are aware both of the technical difficulties of achieving this in individual cases and of the feeling still strongly held in some quarters that an employer who has an occupational scheme should not be obliged by law to provide towards an occupational pension forsomeone who has chosen to leave his service. Some additional cost would,moreover, fall on many of the funds concerned, since at present the
contributions made by the employer for people who leave remain in the&apos;fund to finance the benefits of the remaining members, and are, of course, takeninto account in assessing the contributions required for this purpose. It must also be appreciated that preservation of rights means not only that the employees contributions remain to the credit of the employee^ ultima^pension, but that the employee must forgo the right he usually has at prese&apos;.&apos;.of receiving back his own contributions as a lump sum on change ofemployment. Nevertheless, the Government hope that the movement towardspreservation of pension rights in occupational schemes will grow still further.26. The growing importance of occupational schemes has also led tosuggestions that more should be done to ensure that adequate factual information about them is regularly available. Some schemes are registered under various enactments with the Registrar of Friendly Societies and submitaccounts to him. Those which are operated through insurance companiescome within the financial safeguards provided by the supervision of insurancegenerally by the Board of Trade. There are, however, many schemes whichare not. registered or supervised. Some more systematic arrangements for registration may therefore be called for, on general grounds and for the purposeof facilitating the collection at intervals of statistical information on the linesof the Government Actuary&apos;s survey, as recommended by the PhillipsCommittee.Taxation Concessions in Old Age27. While the various reliefs given under fiscal legislation to the old andto provision for old age, are not in any sense subsidies, they are relevant toa general review of provision for old age. In this field Government policy has followed a systematic pattern of lightening the tax burden on the old.Thus, improvements have been made in the &quot; age relief&quot; which gives the equivalent of the earned income relief on the investment income of a taxpayerwho (or whose wife) is aged 65 or over and whose total income does not exceeda prescribed limit; in 1951 the limit was  500 but it was raised to  600 in 1953and to  700 in 1957; and this year it is being raised to  800. (To prevent thesteep increase in tax that would otherwise occur at the income limits for theage relief there are provisions for marginal relief for incomes somewhat abovethese limits.)28. In addition, a special relief was introduced last year (the &quot;ageexemption&quot;) to help elderly people living on the smallest incomes; thisexempted from tax single persons aged 65 or over with a total income notexceeding  250 and married couples where either the husband or the wife is65 or over and their total income does not exceed  400. These income limitsare being increased this year to  275 and  440.29. The effect of these changes combined with the lightening of theburden of taxation generally, has been to relieve considerably the position ofthose the overwhelming majority of them elderly who live on small fixedincomes. For all old people with incomes, however derived, up to  800 ayear, the liability for tax has been substantially reduced since 1950-51. Forinstance a single pensioner with  5 a week in that year paid over 7s. a week in income tax. This year he is exempt. In 1950-51 a married pensioner with 8 a week for himself and his wife paid over 10s. a week in income tax, while this year, again, he is exempt. The pensioner couple with  10 a week in1950-51 paid nearly  1 a week in income tax. This year they pay just overlOs. a week.
National Assistance30. The reforms of social security originating in the Beveridge Reportrecognised that it would never be possible to provide for all the requirementsof all old persons through an insurance scheme, however carefully andvfiyierously devised. The Beveridge Report, indeed, envisaged that the pension: nesnefits would only gradually rise, over a twenty year period, to the fullstandard level, those receiving the intermediate rates being helped, inaccordance with their means, by National Assistance. The national assistance Scheme formed an integral part of the arrangements madefollowing the introduction of the National Insurance Scheme, as a means of ensuring that each individual, according to his needs, should have what he orshe needed to live. While the growth of occupational pension schemes, andthe growing tendency to work to higher ages, with the consequent earning ofincrements on the national pension, should, as the years pass, reduce the callon National Assistance, the need for such direct help, suited to the individualsneeds and humanely administered, will always be present. There are signs that with the passage of time the fact that this help is provided as a right is coming to be realised.III.-THE FOUNDATIONS FOR FUTURE DEVELOPMENTReinforcement of the Financial Base31. The analysis of the present position, in Part II above, underlines the limitations of a flat-rate contribution by itself as an adequate base for thefuture development of national pension provision. In particular a contributionfixed at a level which the lowest paid can afford can produce only limitedrevenue and so only a limited pension. The speed of the convoy is kept tothat of its slowest ship.32. The principle of a flat-rate contribution has stood the test of publicopinion under many different kinds of stress for nearly half a century, and hasthe great practical advantages of familiarity and administrative simplicity.The equal incidence of a flat-rate contribution on all kinds of employment(e.g., whole-time and part-time, high paid and low paid), is felt relatively littlewhen the rate of contribution is low, but becomes less acceptable when therate is increased. In a universal scheme the inability to discriminate between individuals in seeking to give a limited amount of help from general taxationto those least able to meet the flat rate contributions has also become ahandicap to the proper development of the scheme.33. The weight of the existing contribution in comparison to currentearnings should not be exaggerated, as the following table shows:  Table IIInsurance Contribution as Percentage of Industrial EarningsYear	Percentage of Aver represented by th Stamp i Male Employee	age Industrial Earnings e National Insurance n respect of Female Employee1946 1948 1951 1958	7-5 6-8 5-7 7-2	10-9 9-7 8-2 11-2
The National Insurance contribution fixed for an employed man and his employer under the National Insurance Act, 1946 (including the elementsfor Industrial Injuries and National Health Service) was 8s. Id. a week, and amount to 1\ per cent, of average industrial earnings at that time. To-day the corresponding weekly contribution, though considerably higher in terrr-of money, represents [less than 7  per cent.] of average earnings in indust),to-day, i.e., a lower proportion than when it was originally fixed. For womenthe proportion of women&apos;s earnings represented by the current contribution is slightly higher than it was in 1946, and it is true that between 1946 and1948, when the new contributions came into full operation, the level of earnings generally had risen.34. To rely for reinforcement of the financial base on enlargement ofthe contribution from general taxation would amount to drawing a blankcheque on the future. It would also undermine the protection given to theindividual by the fact that the benefits he receives are related to the contri-butions he personally makes. The principle of guaranteeing benefits byfinancing them outside the general budgetary structure through contributions for this particular purpose is widely followed in countries where social securityhas been developed, including even Communist countries. The Governmenthave no hesitation in rejecting tax-financed social security, even as a temporary expedient, as dangerous in itself, and likely to be unacceptable to the people as a whole, who believe in paying their way.A System of Graduated Contributions and Benefits35. The only feasible alternative is the introduction of a system ofcontributions and benefits graduated by reference to earnings either as anextension or as a modification of the existing flat-rate scheme. The adminis-trative problems of such a change from our present system should not beunderestimated. The present apparatus of insurance cards and weekly stamps,for instance, with which everyone is familiar, would have to be largely replaced by a system of collection in association with P.A.Y.E. New relationships between contributions and benefits would have to be established; and therewould be many other problems.The Problem of Dimensions36. The immediate question which arises is the extent of the earningsto which graduation should apply. This question of size is critical. It is notthe Governments view that the State should compel people to contribute for more than a modest provision in old age. How people spend or allocate theirincomes during working life in other respects is not a matter on which theGovernment should legislate. Attempts to do this would undermine theindividual^ sense of responsibility for his own affairs.37. An excessive extension of the State pensions scheme by way ofgraduation could, moreover, do grave damage to existing occupational pension schemes and future developments in this field. This would happen even with provision for contracting-out. The Government is therefore convinced thatany graduation of contributions and pensions in relation to earnings shouldnot extend to a level much above average industrial earnings.The Self-Employed38. The position of those who earn through self-employment is different.They have no employer with whom to share a pension contribution, butopportunities are now open to them, since the Finance Act of 1956, to providefor their own old age with similar reliefs to those given to employed persons
who belong to occupational pension schemes. There would in any case bevery great practical difficulties in assessing the amounts on which graduated contributions should be paid by the self-employed. For all these reasons theGovernment consider that graduated contributions could not apply to the-elf-employed.Linking of Benefit Rates with the Cost of Living39. Arguments have sometimes been advanced under the present system for providing an automatic link between pensions and the cost of living, andalthough this has always been rejected in the past as undesirable orimpracticable it is appropriate to deal with this point in this review. Anysuch link would involve a reduction of pension if prices fell, with all thedifficulties which were experienced when service pensions were linked withthe cost of living between the wars, as well as an increase of pension whereprices rose. There arc also practical limits to the frequency with which such changes can be made. More serious is the absence of financial provision to meet the extra cost of automatic increases in pension rates. In default of any such provision, the National Insurance Fund would fall into increasingdeficit, and there has always been a fundamental objection to any automaticlinking of pension rates with the cost of living which could, in this way,commit future Parliaments to expenditure of unspecified but possiblyincreasingly large amounts, in circumstances which cannot be foreseen inadvance.40. To guarantee pensions against the effects of inflation would also have important economic implications. There is a real danger that the taking of inflation for granted would itself prove a fresh stimulus to inflation,with serious consequences for the economy. In particular, the incentive to make any form of long-term saving might well be seriously weakened.41. The Government will of course keep pension rates under review.In view, however, of the importance of changes in rates of pension andcontribution, not only to pensioners and contributors individually but to the economy as a whole, it is essential that, when such changes are required, theyshould be embodied in a Bill and fully debated by Parliament. Parliamentought not, in the Government^ view, to have removed from it the opportunityof examining proposals for increasing the expenditure on pensions in thelight of the social and economic conditions obtaining at the time when such increases are to be made.Division of Contribution Between Employers and Employed42. Throughout the history of national insurance, contributions paid for employed persons have been shared as nearly as may be equally betweenemployer and employed. The Government is satisfied that this is the rightprinciple and there is no reason why it should not be preserved in thepayment of graduated contributions.Exchequer Support of the Scheme43. It has always been a feature of our National Scheme of PensionsInsurance that it should be supported, not only by the contributions ofinsured persons and their employers, but by contributions from general taxation. This should continue, but it is vital from many points of view notonly that the extent of this assistance should be clearly defined in advancebut that its purpose should be well understood. Only in this way willcontributors gain a proper understanding of their own responsibility for keeping the scheme solvent.  The justification for the Exchequer contribution
is, fundamentally, to assist in providing those who could not otherwise affordit with a modest level of pension in their old age and in widowhood. Theintroduction of graduation of contributions and benefits by reference to earnings would afford a ready means of giving clearer effect to this principlethan has been possible in a flat-rate scheme which has been extended so thatirth,it now provides pensions for persons of all income levels. It would enabrrcsf&apos;advantage to be taken of this, so as to concentrate the assistance given by theExchequer on those with a low level of earnings. The adoption of graduation,however, would also present the danger that the scheme might be distortedso as to compel contributors with higher earnings, regardless of their other circumstances, to subsidise the pensions of others. Any such development would not only be unjust to those called upon to pay more than their propershare but would quickly destroy the insurance character of the scheme and create dangers for the maintenance and free development of occupational pension provision outside the State system.IV.-RELATIONSHIP OF THE STATE SCHEME TO occupational pension SCHEMESOccupational Schemes44. The Government is convinced that no changes in the field of national insurance should be allowed to hamper the vigorous development of independent provision for old age, whether through occupational schemes orotherwise. This form of provision holds out the prospect, on terms suited to the needs and preferences of different industries and occupations, of amore comfortable maintenance in old age for the majority of the working population. Here the Government has in mind not only the valuable rightsof members of existing schemes, but the future possibilities of development in this field.45. As above indicated, the Government attach very great importanceto the development of occupational schemes, whose social and economic value to the community is so considerable. In the nature of things any development of State pensions must have its repercussions on these pension schemes. Very careful study has therefore been given to the problem ofcausing the least possible damage to them.46. Although it is perhaps the case that the move to universality in1946 paid insufficient attention to occupational pension schemes, theGovernment believe that the principle of universality is now accepted inrespect of the present National Insurance that-rate benefits. But in going beyond these and in introducing a modest system of wage related contributions and pension benefits it would be no part of the Governments intention to compel State provision of this sort in cases where such provision is alreadyadequately made. It would, therefore, be inherent in proposals by theGovernment that there should be no compulsion on those already adequatelycovered to contribute for a State graduated pension.47. After careful examination the Government have come to theconclusion:(a) that the exercise of an option to contract out could be permittedsubject to three conditions more fully dealt with in paragraphs 48 and49 below;(b) that it would be impracticable for such an option to be exercised by individual members of schemes and that it would therefore have to beexercised on a group basis. The reasons for this are examined inparagraph 50 below.
The application to contract out would be submitted to a registrar whowould grant a Certificate of Exception on the lines of those granted under the1926 Contributory Pensions scheme.48. The registrar should be by Statute under an obligation to satisfyin self that certain criteria had been satisfied before granting such a certificate..nese criteria would be:  (a) that the benefit provided was as good as that provided at the maximum rate by the State scheme. In other words, it would be incumbent onthe applicant to show that the pension benefit provided amounted tono less than the benefit earned in the State scheme by a man paying the maximum contributions over the same period as the employee whowas a member of the private scheme concerned;(b) that the occupational scheme was sound. In the case of StatutorySchemes, or those. insured with Life Offices, who are subject tosupervision by the Board of Trade, little evidence would here be needed. In other cases, audited accounts would require to besubmitted and the registrar would be entitled to make enquiries on other relevant points.49. It would be necessary to require adequate provision to be made forpreservation of pension rights up to. but not necessarily beyond, the pension rights required to satisfy criterion (a) above if the employee ceases to be amember of the scheme (e.g., on change of job). If such preservation were not provided in the rules of the occupational scheme itself (e.g., by provision ofan appropriate &quot; frozen &quot; pension at an age not later than 65, or by a transferpayment to another occupational scheme) there would be a liability for payment into the National Insurance Fund of an amount not less than thedifference between the contributions already paid in respect of the employeeand the amount which would have been paid if contributions had been payable to the State scheme during the period of exception at the maximum levelpayable under that scheme. This payment would be treated as a transferpayment purchasing equivalent rights for the employee in the State scheme.50. It is clear that as occupational schemes are created in many caseswith a view, inter alia, to the improvement of industrial relations, it is unlikely that anyone responsible for a scheme would seek to take its membersout of the graduated State contribution against the wishes of any substantial number of them. This is. of course, a problem which does not exist inrespect of those individuals whose membership of schemes is voluntary.For the other cases, however, safeguards would have to be provided. Toprovide for individuals to have an option would lead to serious complicationsin the administration of both the State and the occupational schemes (e.g., the enforcement of the proper contributions in respect of each individual wouldbecome very difficult), particularly if, as might have to be the case, the optioncould be altered in the light of changed circumstances, such as changes ofjob or grade. The more appropriate safeguard is that provision should bemade for an employer, or for the trustees of the scheme, making an appli-cation to contract out of the graduated part of the State scheme to be undera statutory obligation to give a prescribed period of advanced notice of theapplication to all who would be affected by it. The possibility of provision&apos;for a poll in case of disputes should not be excluded. In that way allconcerned would have an opportunity to consider and discuss the desirabilityof contracting out before the application was submitted.51. An occupational scheme not contracted out might cither continue at its existing level, as a supplementation of the State scheme, or those con-cerned might wish to modify it to take account of the new situation.   For the
PART V.-THE GOVERNMENTS PROPOSALS52. The proposals which the Government now put forward have, there-fore, the following objectives:  (1) To place the National Insurance scheme on a solvent basis.(2) To institute provision for those employed persons who are not coveredby an appropriate occupational scheme to obtain some measure ofpension related to earnings.(3) Consistently with the above, to preserve and encourage the bestdevelopment of occupational pension schemes.53. The Government therefore propose that a change to graduated contributions and pensions must be made in the near future if the national insurance scheme is to continue to play its proper part in the community^provision for old age. They consider that for all employed men over 18who are not contracted out as members of approved occupational pension schemes, the present flat-rate National Insurance contribution should bereplaced by a minimum joint contribution of 15s. 4d. a week, which is equivalent to 81 per cent, of earnings of  9 a week. In respect of earnings above  9 a week and up to  15 a week, there will be a joint contribution of81 per cent, of earnings. For women over 18 the minimum joint contributionwill be 12s. lOd. a week (i.e., 8 per cent, of earnings of  8 a week) and on earnings between  8 and  15 a week the joint contribution will be 8 per cent.54. The minimum contribution will include contributions divided equally between employer and employee for the flat-rate Industrial Injuries scheme,and towards the flat-rate benefits of National Insurance. It will also includethe National Health Service contribution, divided between employer and employee in the way settled by Parliament last year. The man&apos;s minimumcontribution will thus be divided into an employees share of 7s. Od. and an employee&apos;s share of 8s. 4d. For women the employees share will be 6s. andthe employee&apos;s 6s. lOd. These minimum contributions compare with thepresent flat rate of 18s. 2d. a week for men (9s. lid. employee and 8s. 3d.employer) and 14s. 9d. a week for women (8s. employee and 6s. 9d. employer).Credits for these minimum contributions during periods of unemployment,incapacity, &amp;c, will be given on the same basis as at present, to preserve title to the flat-rate benefits including the present retirement pension.55. The graduated contributions payable on earnings above  9 a week(men) and  8 a week (women) will relate to pensions only and will be equallydivided between the employer and the employee. Since these contributionsare entirely related to actual earnings, the rules as to credits during periods of interruption of employment will not apply to them.Persons Contracted Out56. These and their employers will continue to pay contributions at therates which at present are applicable to employed persons.latter contingency, legislation would provide, as under Section 69 (4) of the1946 National Insurance Act, for expeditious modification of schemes onan application being made to the appropriate authority. These powers wouldalso be available for modification of schemes required in connection with applications for contracting out. ^-
The Self-employed and the Non-employed57. The position of the self-employed and of insured persons during periods of non-employment will not be affected. The contributions willremain at the same weekly rates as are now payable.\Jmployed Juveniles58. Young persons up to 18 who are employed will not be liable for the graduated contributions but they and their employers will pay contributionsat the same rate as those now payable.Assessment and Collection59. The minimum and flat-rate contributions will be a weekly liability,as at present. The liability for graduated contributions will be assessed inrelation to earnings in the relevant pay period, e.g., weekly or monthly, andthe contributions will be due at the time the earnings are paid. Special ruleswill be provided for those who receive their earnings in notably unequalinstalments. Over a very wide range of the contributions the system of collection, both as to the minimum and the flat-rate contributions, will be onthe lines of P.A.Y.E., but stamp cards or other existing methods of collectionwill be retained for certain categories, including the self-employed and thenon-employed. The Government intend to enter into detailed discussion ofthe technical problems with representatives of those concerned as soon aspossible.Provision against Future Deficits60. The deficits on National Insurance pension account are duefundamentally to the award of pensions at current rates to people who cannot have contributed enough to pay for them and to changes in the national agestructure which have already taken place. It is therefore right to provide now for meeting them as and when they occur. The system of contributionsproposed above will provide a buoyant, rather than a static source of income for the Fund, since it will yield more as national earnings rise. Thecontributions will also provide enough additional income to keep the Fund in balance for the first five years of the new scheme. Thereafter, however, theywill not be sufficient, and legislative provision will be made at the outset ofthe new scheme for increases in all the rates of contribution to take effect atfive-yearly intervals thereafter for the first twenty years of the scheme. Thisfollows the precedent of the original Contributory Pensions Act, which provided for a series of decennial increases, and of the National InsuranceAct, 1946, which provided for the contributions to be increased five yearsafter the new pension rates came into payment. The increases proposed areof i per cent, a side of earnings on which contributions are due. Appropriateincreases would be made in the minimum contributions and in the flat-rate contributions for the self-employed, the non-employed, and those contracted out.Benefits61. Everyone will remain covered for the appropriate flat-rate benefits(including retirement pensions) of the present National Insurance andIndustrial Injuries schemes on the existing conditions, whether they payflat-rate or graduated contributions. The graduated contributions in the state scheme will be related only to pensions.62. The minimum contributions of those paying under the graduated scheme and the flat-rate contributions of those outside it will count towards
a retirement pension at the present flat rate, and contributions under ,theexisting scheme will be taken into account. The graduated contributions will count towards a graduated retirement pension which, like the fiat ratepension with which it will be incorporated, will be payable from age 70(65 for women) in any case and. on earlier retirement, from age 65(60 for women) in which case it will be subject to the earnings rule up &quot;age 70 (65 for women). The amount of the graduated part of the retiremee.mpension will depend on the total of graduated contributions paid from the start of the scheme. For men, contributions on every  1 of average earnings above  9 a week, paid over the period from 18 to 65, will provide anadditional amount of pension of nearly 7s. a week. Contributions paidafter 65, where retirement has been postponed, will earn a further additionto the ultimate pension payable on retirement. A man paying the maximumcontribution on average earnings of  15 a w-ek 13s. 5d. for the man himself,which is 3s. 6d. a week more than he pays under the existing scheme willbe able to qualify at 65 for about  2 a week extra on his flat-rate pension,giving him a total pension cf  6 a week if he is married and  4 10s. a weekif he is single. A man with average earnings of about  12 a week would himself pay 10s. lid. a week a Is. more than he pays at present and wouldbe able at 65 to qualify for an extra pension of about  1 a week, giving him a total pension of  5 a week, if he is married, and  3 10s. if he is single.63. These are the amounts of pension for those who will have contributedover the full period from 18 years of age to 65. It is proposed that those whopay graduated contributions for shorter periods should earn l/45th of theappropriate full rate of additional pension for each year they pay their contributions, so that each year of graduated contributions will build up anentitlement to an increase on the flat-rate pension. (The full number of possible years of membership of the graduated part of the scheme beforeminimum pension age is reached is 47 but the more favourable lower figure is adopted to make some allowance for non-earning periods occasioned, forexample, by further education or for temporary interruption or reduction of earnings due to such factors as sickness or unemployment.)64. To take an example or two, a man contributing at the highest ratefor 15 years will be able to get 15/45ths of  2 about 14s. over and above his flat-rate pension. A man contributing on average earnings of  12for 20 years would get 20/45ths of  1 about 9s. a week extra pension.65. While large additions to the present 50s. pension cannot become available under these arrangements for some years, some additional pension will be available for those retiring a year or two after the commencement ofthe scheme. Thus, Is. extra pension will be payable on retirement at age 65for those who are nearly 64 when the scheme starts and who pay contributionson average earnings of  15 a week.66. For women the graduated contributions and benefits follow a similarpattern, though both contributions and benefits are smaller. For them theminimum contribution towards the present flat rate benefits corresponds to per cent, of earnings of  8 a week and the liability to contribute at this rate (instead of the %\ per cent, applicable in the case of men) will continue on earnings up to  15 a week. But they have a shorter contributing life than menand may expect to draw pension from age 60 on average for 18\ years ascompared with a man&apos;s expectation of just under 12 years on pension fromage 65. They will, therefore, earn additional pensions at a maximum rate which is approximately three-quarters of that applicable to men. A womancontributing on maximum earnings of  15 a week from 18 to 60 she willherself pay 12s. 5d. as compared with 8s. now may from that age qualify
for a graduated amount of pension of just over 30s. a week in addition toher fiat-rate pension of 50s. a week, giving her a total pension of rather morethan  4 a week. A woman paying contributions on average earnings of  11a week will herself pay 9s. 3d. a week as compared with 8s. now and willqualify for an extra pension of over 13s. a week at 60 in addition to her flat-tte pension, so that she will have over 3 guineas a week in all.67. These examples apply where a woman contributes for the fullnumber of years from 18 to 60. Those who pay graduated contributions forshorter periods will earn 1 /40th of the appropriate full rate of additionalpensions for each year they pay their contributions. (The full number of possible years of membership of the graduated part of the scheme beforeminimum pension age is reached is 42 but, as with men. a more favourablefigure of 40 is taken as divisor to give some allowance for temporary inter-ruptions of normal earnings.) Thus, a woman contributing at the highestrate for 15 years will be able to get 15/40ths of 30s. an increase of between us. and 12s. a week on her flat-rate pension. A woman contributing on average earnings of  11 a week for 20 years would get 20/40ths of 13s. that is, 6s. 6d. a week extra on her pension.68. To avoid inconvenient amounts pensions will be payable to the nearest sixpence.69. If a contributor leaves a widow she will receive a graduatedretirement pension based on his graduated contribution when she retires afterage 60 (or at once, if she has already retired). This is apart from any rightsshe may have to flat-rate widow&apos;s benefit during her retirement or at an earlier age under the existing arrangements, which will continue.70. The contributions and benefits proposed, together with examples,are set out in tabular form in Appendix 1.*Exchequer Contributions71. The Exchequer will collaborate in the Scheme by payments fromgeneral taxation as follows:  (1) One-quarter of the amount contributed for National Insurance on allearnings up to [ 9 a week (men) and  8 a week (women)] derivedfrom employment not covered by an approved occupational pension scheme.(2) Supplements on the existing basis to the flat-rate contributions ofself-employed and non-employed persons and of employed juveniles.(3) Supplements on the existing basis to the flal-rate contributions of thosein approved occupational pension schemes in respect of the benefits of the National Insurance and Industrial Injuries Schemes other thanthe retirement pension.72. The financial effect of these proposals is set out in tabular form inAppendix II.*.Contracting Out73. The existing flat-rate contributions will continue to be paid in respectof employees who are contracted out by virtue of membership of a pension scheme constituted under trusts or inalienable policies of insurance in whichpension benefits are on the whole as favourable as those of the new state scheme. The latter condition means that an employment will only be excepted* Not attached.17
53803 Wt.     /       It       7/58 r.o.r.if (apart from the flat-rate State pension for which all will continue to be covered compulsorily) those in it are covered, by virtue of that employment,for a pension at age 65 (60 for women) at the rate of at least 40s. a week(30s. in the case of women) for a full period of service. The conditions in thefollowing paragraphs will also have to be fulfilled.74. In order to ensure that the accrued pension rights in respect of whf^the graduated State contribution is excused are not lost either on change ofemployment or cessation of the occupational scheme, employers of personsexempted will be subject to a special requirement. This will be satisfied if itis shown that pension rights at least equivalent to the maximum rights whichcould have been earned under the National Insurance Scheme over the periodsuch an employee was contracted out are satisfactorily secured to him onattainment of minimum pension age. for instance by way of a frozen pensionin the occupational scheme itself, or by a capital transfer to anothercontracted out occupational scheme. Arrangements will be made to maintain a central register of rights preserved in this way. Otherwise the employer willbe liable to pay into the National Insurance Fund in respect of any person whoceases to be covered (e.g., on a change of job) the difference between the flat-rate contributions already paid in respect of the person in question whilecontracted out. and the graduated contributions in respect of that periodappropriate to the maximum rate of State pension. The contributor will thenbe credited for pension purposes in the National Insurance Scheme as if.throughout the period during which he was contracted out. he had paidcontributions at the highest rate during the period in question. In dischargingthis liability the employer will be entitled to recover up to half the amount required from any contributions under the occupational scheme which would otherwise be returnable to the employee.75. Evidence will be required of the soundness of schemes coveringpersons in respect of whom graduated contributions are excused and of continued satisfaction of the conditions of excusal. There will be power, forinstance, to require accounts and valuations of such schemes by an actuary,and to require deficiency payments to be made to the scheme concerned if that should be necessary to protect the benefits of the members in so far as these have been accepted as equivalent to those of the State scheme. failure to comply with directions given may involve the withdrawal of the certificate of exception, and the payment of arrears of graduated contributions at themaximum rate, as described above.76. It will be the duty of the registrar to grant certificates of exceptionon application, if he is satisfied that the employees described in theapplication are covered in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs.Date of Commencement77. The changeover to the new system will involve a very great amountof detailed technical replanning by both employers and the GovernmentDepartments concerned. For this the Government envisages at least two years will be required. The association of the collection of contributions with.A.Y.E. requires that these should become operative from the beginning ofan income tax year. At this stage, before detailed provisions have beensubmitted to Parliament, the Government cannot indicate the date at which thenew scheme could be fully operative, but this clearly could not be before April1961. The Government hope, however, that the machinery for receivingapplications to contract out of the graduated contributions, or to modifypension schemes in the light of the changed situation, will be in operationconsiderably sooner than this, so that the scheme may move off to a smoothstart, with as little disturbance of the occupational field as possible.
