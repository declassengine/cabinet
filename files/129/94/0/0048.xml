Tr-   err.RETURN 6)secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT-- 3()printed for the Cabinet.   September 1958C. (58) 198 Copy No. 5730th September, 1958CABINETOIL supplies memorandum by the Minister of power as an insurance against the sudden disruption of this country&apos;s oil supplies,the oil companies agreed earlier this year to hold substantially higher stocks inthe United Kingdom than before the Suez crisis. Further, approval in principle was given to the extension of the Ministry of Power&apos;s underground Potash Brine(P.B.) storage by 1 million tons from a capacity of 1-2 million tons to 2-2 million tons. As will be seen from Appendix A to this paper, the arrangements madewith the oil companies have resulted in their stocks being increased to approximately14 weeks&apos; supply. Recent events in the Middle East suggest that we should examineurgently whether any further insurance against an interruption of imported oil supplies should be undertaken, and if so, in what manner.2. There is always the danger of interruption or cessation of our oil supplies from the Middle East. The table at Appendix B (which was prepared in the courseof a Joint Anglo-American Study) demonstrates the effect on Europe&apos;s oil suppliesof various possible situations in the Middle East. It will be seen that the cessation of imports from all Middle East producers except Iran would reduce Europe&apos;s oil supplies to less than half of normal if no additional oil was imported from theWestern hemisphere. At best the supplies could be raised to three-quarters of normal if (a) an extra 50 million tons annually were imported from the West at adollar cost of $1,000 millions (75 per cent, falling on the United Kingdom) and (b)India and the other Eastern consumers accepted some reduction in their Iraniansupplies. If they declined to accept a cut Europe might not do better than two-thirds of normal.3. Our present civil stocks would enable us to limit restrictions on consumption to an overall 10 per cent, cut for a period of 8 months if externalsupplies reached 75 per cent, of normal and 5 months if the external supplies were no more than 66f per cent. If our stock level could be raised by 1 month&apos;snormal supply either these periods of grace could be entended to 15 months and months respectively, or the rate of the dollar drain could be reduced.4. Government owned stocks of oil total over 2 million tons but these wereacquired for defence reasons and we could not rely on much of them being available for civil purposes in the type of crisis we may have to face. The oil companies are unlikely to add further to their own stocks as they are generallyof the opinion that in reaching the present stock level they have already gonefurther than their commercial needs. The capital cost of the present improvementin commercial stocks compared with pre-Suez levels is of the order of  60 millions.5. The substantial advantages of adding a month&apos;s supply to our stockpilesuggest that we should consider seriously the provision of Government funds forthis purpose. As indicated in paragraph 3 we should be able to face the interruption of Middle East oil supply for nearly twice as long without serious location of the economy. In addition oil acquired before a crisis can be boughtfor sterling at normal prices as against a higher price in dollars during a crisis,and the risk of a trading loss is negligible.54112B
6. In a crisis it is to be expected that Europe&apos;s oil supplies would be pooledand shared as they were during the Suez incident. It has been agreed that countrieswhich create a special reserve stock should derive the full benefit from it, but thereis a risk that if we raised our own stock level much above that of Europe generallywe should not be able to avoid entirely some sharing of the excess. Although sharingwould of course reduce the periods of grace mentioned in paragraph 3,1 am sure thatthe balance of advantage would still lie with adding to our stockpile. The following paragraphs consider possible methods of securing additional stocks amounting to1 month&apos;s inland consumption which in 1959 would total about 24- million tons.Filling of Empty Government Storage Tanks7. One way in which a material addition to our stocks can be achieved quicklyis to fill available Government storage with oil (mainly with refined products, as most of the storage is technically unsuitable for crude oil).&apos; About \ million tonscapacity, mainly buried tanks (owned by the Service Departments as well as theMinistry of Power), is available for filling during the current financial year. Afurther   million tons is expected to become available thereafter, although this figure is subject to adjustment in the light of the changing defence requirements of theService Departments. I propose that my Department should be authorised, subjectto discussion of a detailed programme with the Treasury and the service departments, to purchase and store 4- million tons of oil (mainly refined products)as soon as practicable, and a further J million tons as storage becomes available.The cost of the full programme would be about  10 millions, and maintenance andturnover of the stocks would amount to some  225,000 a year. About  7 millions ofthe capital cost would fall in the current financial year, and a supplementary estimate would be necessary. For the reasons given in paragraph 16 below, Iconsider that the Government should be prepared to meet the cost of these measures.8. It is possible that in the longer term the Service Departments may findfurther storage, and certain of their stocks, surplus to defence requirements. If theCommittee approves my proposals in the above paragraph, I shall invite the service ministers to agree that before any surplus stocks and installations are offered for commercial disposal my Department should be consulted to examine whether the storage and oil involved would be suitable for use as a civil reserve.Development of P.B. Capacity9. A detailed scheme for the extension of P.B. capacity by 1 million tonsalready approved is almost ready, and it should be possible to start developmentsoon. A small part of the new capacity should begin to become available next year,but the bulk of it will not be completed until the second and subsequent years.10. No decision has yet been taken about the filling of the new capacity. Thecost would be about  84; millions if crude oil was stored, or up to  15 millions ifrefined products were selected (as they would be if defence considerations prevailed).I consider that we should take steps to fill the new P.B. capacity as it becomes available, and I propose in paragraph 17 that preliminary discussions should be held with the oil companies about the financing of the required stocks.Other Possible Methods11. The above measure would increase our stocks by If million tons, but toprovide a full month&apos;s extra stock we should require a further   million tons. Itwould be possible to increase P.B. storage in the area of the present scheme, beyondthe extra 1 million tons approved, by a further 1 million or even 2 million tons of capacity at a cost within  2 a ton. This is the cheapest method of storage we know,but it might be up to 5 years before such extensions could be completely filled.12. An alternative possibility would be to build surface tanks of conventionaltype. Assuming suitable sites are not already in Government ownership (andso far as is known they are not), the construction of surface tanks of f million tonscapacity would take about 2\ years, of which nearly 18 months might be needed to acquire the land by negotiation (it is very doubtful whether compulsory powers could properly be used for this purpose), and rather more than a year for construction and filling. The cost of construction might be  6 millions and offilling with crude oil  64- millions. It is doubtful whether the time saved would justify us in proceeding with this, as against the considerably cheaper P.B. storage.
13. A much speedier alternative though I do not know whether it wouldbe possible would be an arrangement with the oil companies to build Governmentstorage on their land, preferably adjacent to the refineries where the crude oilwould be processed. Under such an arrangement (which would need to ensurethat the companies did not reduce their own storage plans as a consequence) thetime needed for completion of the new tanks might be reduced to about 18 months,and this acceleration might be sufficiently important to warrant the higher costof this type of storage as against P.B.14. Another possible method of increasing our oil stocks quickly wouldbe to use surplus tankers as floating storage. If this were done on a substantial scale, e.g., to store 1 million tons of oil for which about 60 tankers wouldbe needed, any present surplus of suitable British tankers would be fullyabsorbed and a considerable number of foreign ships might have to be chartered.I am advised that charterings on this scale might have a sharp impact on the tankerfreight market, and that there are also technical difficulties in the way of usingtankers for storage. In addition the maintenance for storage purposes of tankerswhich would otherwise be scrapped might tend to deter some companies fromordering new tonnage, with a consequent weakening of one form of insurance against a Middle East crisis.15. At the present time the most promising method is the construction ofGovernment tankage on oil industry land and I would like to have my colleagues&apos;agreement to exploring this possibility with the industry. There may well be other feasible methods of constructing new storage, and I have set up a committee under Sir Solly Zuckerman to report to me on the relative advantages of allthe possibilities in this field, but I do not think the action I suggest in this paperought to await this Committee&apos;s report which would involve delay of six months or more.Finance16. In considering how the measures proposed in this paper should be financed,it is clear that the industry will be most reluctant to accept any burden in addition tothat which they are already carrying by virtue of their increased commercial stocks.They would submit, with justification in my view, that before they were asked tomake further stock provision, the Government should make some contribution fromthe Exchequer towards the measures proposed; so far the Government has paidnothing, but has received substantial revenue from the running down of Services&apos;stocks from their higher pre-Suez levels. It is for this reason that I have proposedthat the cost of filling the empty Government storage should fall on the Exchequer.If this Government expenditure is approved, I would feel able to sound the industry on what would be the largest contribution they could be induced to make towardsthe cost of filling the new P.B. capacity and constructing and filling the newproposed surface storage. I cannot predict the outcome of such consultation,but I suspect that the oil companies may feel that they could not add further totheir expenditure on storage without a special increase in the prices of their products for the purpose and that this would only be practicable if the Governmentwere to accept responsibility for it.Summary17.   I invite my colleagues:  (a) to agree in principle that the addition as soon as possible of anothermonth&apos;s supply to our oil stockpile is most desirable;(b) as steps towards achieving this end:  (i) to approve the purchase of \ million tons of oil (mainly refined products) by the Ministry of Power at an estimated cost of 7 millions, for storage in empty Government tanks under a detailed programme to be worked out with the service departments and the Treasury;(ii) to agree that a further i million tons of Government storage whichis expected to become available should be similarly filled at an estimated cost of  3 millions if need be at Governmentexpense;54112
(iii) to agree in principle that as and when it becomes available the1 million tons of new P.B. storage should be filled with oil andthat a further J million tons of storage (probably conventionaltankage) should be constructed and filled as soon as practicable;(iv) to authorise me to consult with the oil companies about theadditional stocking programme and ascertain from them whatcontribution they would be prepared to make to its cost andon what terms.M.Ministry of Power, S.W. 1,30th September, 1958.APPENDIX a united KINGDOM OIL STOCKSI.
