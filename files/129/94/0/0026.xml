T SECRET *&quot;       ^(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)C.(58) 176 COPY NO.    G&apos;-2nd September, 1958CABINETMALTAMemorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of State for Colonial AffairsWe circulate for the consideration of the Cabinet a detailedmemorandum on Malta&apos;s financial position and prospects.background.        The Maltese Islands cover approximately 122 square miles, witha population estimated at 31st March, 1958, of 321,000.   The populationdensity is over 2,600 per square mile,   or &quot;i\ times that of England andWales.   The population shows an annual increase of births over deaths ofsomewhat under 6,000 per annum.   In the past this has been partially orwholly offset by net emigration, but since Mr. Mintoff came to power in1955 the rate of net emigration has declined, partly because emigrationwas discouraged for party political reasons, and is now running at anannual figure of a little over 1,200 compared with the peak figure of10,500&apos; (net) achieved in 1954.   (See details at Annex A.)  The populationpressure in Malta is therefore increasing.   The gainfully occupiedpopulation has fluctuated over recent years and according to the latestcomplete figures is not muchabovethe 1953 figures.   The 1958 estimatesuggests a small rise.    There is a good deal of concealed unemploymentespecially among women.   The Services rank as the major employersabsorbing a little less than one-quarter of the gainfully employedpopulation.   The Maltese Government comes next, employing - with assistance from the United Kingdom amounting to 2/5ths-of the Budget - about one-fifth of the gainfully employed population.   Production (includingagriculture and fishing) absorbs about one-quarter, and services, trade,finance, etc. , the rest.3.        Apart from its strategic value to the United Kingdom and theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation, Malta has as far as is known no naturalassets outside its harbour, its convenient situation on Mediterranean sea and air routes, and its labour force of whom a relatively high proportionare skilled and semi-skilled.   Water supplies are restricted and their development is near its limit.    There are no known mineral resources.Continuing oil exploration has been started as the result of a survey.   Itis too early to say what the results will be.4.        On this restricted base a fairly advanced economy has been built up, well in excess of the island&apos;s intrinsic ability to support it.   The gross domestic product has been rising over recent years and now reachesan annual total of about  38 millions or  121 per head of population, about half of which consists of wages and salary payments (Annex B).   Maltahas a balance of payments surplus on current account, due mainly to thehigh level of receipts from the United Kingdom, which make up about-1-SECRET
twotthirds of Malta&apos;s invisible i reports (Annex C).   She had sterling balancesamounting to  70 millions on 1st July, 1958.   Of this sum the two largestitems of official funds were  23.4 millions representing the currency fundholdings, and  15. 7 millions representing Post Office savings bank funds.Funds of the commercial banks in Malta held in London and funds helddirectly in London banks by Maltese residents amounted to  29.4 millions.The Post Office savings bank is not sufficiently liquid to be a source fromwhich money could be obtained for investment in Malta*s development.The currency funds, however, could provide quite quickly up to about 3 millions for this purpose provided the necessary legislation wereenacted in Malta.   These figures do not include Maltese private investmentoverseas, the bulk of which is believed to come to the United Kingdom, butprovided the right atmosphere of confidence could be created, it is thoughtthat useful sums could be raised locally from the private sector includingpossibly commercial banks.5.        The Maltese economy is artificially maintained in balance, and provides a relatively high standard of living, by United Kingdom aid to andexpenditure in Malta.   The long term economic problem facing Maltaarises from a combination of:-(a) the reorientation of United Kingdom defence expenditure,leading both to a decline in direct United Kingdomexpenditure in Malta, and to a decline in Services employment;(b) a continually expanding population; and(c) virtually no natural resources to develop.This problem has been recognised for a long time and in July, 1955,Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Maltese political Parties issued an agreed statement recognising that &quot;improved living standards can bemaintained only by increasing productivity and expanding the national income of Malta&quot;.  Her Maj esty&apos;s Government undertook to providedevelopment financial and budgetary aid while the Maltese Parties acceptedthe responsibility to prepare a long-term development plan and recognised the need for hard work, self-discipline, and &quot;the best possible contribution from (Maltese) resources&quot;.   We deal in detail with what Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment are doing in paragraphs 13 to 20 below.Maltese Finances up to 1957/586.        Since the last war the Maltese Government expenditure has steadilyexpanded, and the budget has become increasingly out of balance.   TheUnited Kingdom has met the deficits and the amount of United Kingdom aid to Malta has increased steadily until it now meets over one-third of maltese government expenditure.   The trend of Maltese Government expenditure and the trend of United Kingdom assistance is shown at Annex D.    During1957/58 Her Majesty&apos;s Governments grant of  6,065,114 compared witha total Maltese Government expenditure of  15,468,878.   It will be notedby how much United Kingdom aid has been increased since Mr. Mintofftook office.7.        Prior to 1955/56 no distinction was made in the estimates betweenordinary and capital expenditure.   Since 1955/56 as a result of pressure by the Colonial Office two separate sets of estimates have been preparedfor recurrent and capital expenditure, although there is still a certain-2-
amount of overlapping between the two.   United Kingdom financial aidis given towards the Maltese budget as a whole, i. e. recurrent pluscapital expenditure, and the annual total fixed for United Kingdom aidcomprises aid from all sources (see Annex D).    Despite independentexpert advice and continuous pressure by the Colonial Office the maltese government refused to raise any long-term loan finance for its development expenditure, although it could easily have done so e. g. by borrowing fromits own Currency Fund.   Rates of taxation haveremainedunaltered since1948, despite independent expert advice that increases should be made.The 1958/59 Estimates8 The background to the 1958/59 estimates is that they were originally prepared by the late Maltese Government on the assumption thatthe United Kingdom would provide aid to a total of  7 millions for thefinancial year 1958/59, although Maltese Ministers were by then alreadyaware that in view of the need to limit Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentsexpenditure in 1958/59, and to avoid giving Malta unreasonably favourable treatment, Her Majesty*s Covernmenfs financial aid would be reducedto a total of  5 millions (i. e. a cut of a little over  1 million from theprevious financial year) for that year.   The Maltese Government resignedpartly on this issue on 23rd April, by which time the estimates had not yetbeen remitted to London.   In mid-May the head of the Colonial OfficeFinance Department visited Malta and consulted with Maltese officials ona readjustmnet of the Maltese estimates to bring them within the limitsset by United Kingdom financial aid for 1958/59.   Following this visit the estimates were recast and the outline of the 1958/59 Maltese budget wastransmitted to the Colonial Secretary on 18th June.   The detailed changesin the estimates were presented by the Maltese Treasury team at the start of their detailed discussions with the Colonial Office from 8th to 14th July.9. The skeleton of the estimates is shown at Annex E. The summaryposition for 1958/59 appears to be as follows.Total Revenue  9,410,011Total ExpenditureRecurrent  9,723,040Capital  5,730,304              15,741,208Maltese ImperialGovernment  287,500   _Grnss estimatedDeficit  6,331,197United Kingdomfinancial aid  5,000,000Net estimated Deficit  1 331,197To meet this deficit the Maltese authorities proposed to produce a further 778,000 from various funds at their disposal without increasing taxationleaving what they claim to be a residual figure of about  553,000 to be met.-3-
10.       We do not accept this figure of  55 3,00 as a true deficit for two reasons:-(a) The estimates include provision for  410,000 for capitalexpenditure in connection with the construction of a deep-water harbour,of which  300,000 was to be for actual harbour construction.   this estimate was prepared on the assumption of nearly a full year*s construction,whereas in fact the tenders have not yet been let.   It is a safe assumptionthat this item will be under-spent by about  250,000, bringing the residual&quot;deficit&quot; down to  303,000.(b) Over the past three years actual capital expenditure hasshown a shortfall of 13. 6 per cent as compared with approved expenditure,because of limitations on the Maltese Governments physical workscapacity.   The residual &quot;deficit&quot; of  303,000 is equivalent to a shortfall in capital expenditure of about 5.5. per cent.   This rate of shortfallis roughly equivalent to the average for the whole post-war period.There is therefore no reason to suppose that, even leaving out of account the possibility of underestimation of Maltese revenue, the 1958/59 Maltesebudget as presented by the Governor, will close with a deficit.11.       The above takes no account of supplementary expenditure.   the maltese Treasury team were asked for their views and estimated that there might be a requirement for supplementary expenditure on two new servicesof up to  387,000.    In the light of later information we do not consider thatthis additional expenditure will be required before the next financial year.Quite apart from that, the greater part of it is based upon an arbitraryassumption which we have no reason to suppose is correct.12.       Our conclusion is that the Governor should be able to balance his budget this financial year without recourse to additional aid from theUnited Kingdom.   We are also satisfied   that adequate financial provisioncan be made for the essential ncfflsures referred to in paragraph 6 of theGovernor^ letter.(C J^. C. (58)15). These are the deep-water harbour, the in-dustrial estate, the housing scheme, the tourist trade and the Aids to industry bill.   The amounts it is proposed to provide in the estimates a&quot;re&apos;as follows:(a) Harbour  50,000 (this is  250,000 less than theconstruction. Maltese proposed to provide for thereasons explained in paragraph 10 (a)).(b) Industrial estate         65,000 (the original bid was for  100,000but the amount shown has been agreed asa realistic estimate which will enablework to be begun on two factories.)(c) Housing  291,000 (this is the amount originallysought by Mintoff - we have proposedno cut.)(d) Tourism  54,000 (reduced from  87,000 primarily(capital by ready Maltese agreement to drop aexpenditure) proposal to refund customs duty on taxisand taxi meters.)  There were certain minor adjustments on recurrent expenditure on tourism based on a revisedassessment of requirements.
(e) Aids to Industry        The Aids to Industry Bill is notyet even in draft form.   The provisionsof the Bill are most unlikely to be applied in the course of the current financial year.If, contrary to our expectation, it became evident that between now and the end of the financial year additional expenditure to ensure good progress on any of these items was essential, it would then be forconsideration whether (a) such expenditure could be offset by equivalentsavings elsewhere in the Maltese budget or (b) despite the stand we havetaken publicly on the need to restrict United Kingdom financial assistancein the current financial year to Malta to the figure of  5 millions, some increase should be contemplated, although this should be linked to asatisfactory settlement on the capital development programme.The Future13.       The future pattern of Maltafe finances is now being examined by officials.    Paragraph 5 shows that Malta faces the necessity for a fundamental reorientation of her economy due to the decline in directUnited Kingdom expenditure.   The first major step towards this has alreadybeen taken by the decision to transfer the Royal dockyard to commercialoperation.   The dockyard is the core to Malta&apos;s economic problem and whatever else is done in Malta is subsidiary in comparison with theemployment and general prosperity which the dockyard generates.   the conversion of the dockyard is, therefore, Malta&apos;s basic need, and throughthe arrangement Her Majesty&apos;s Government have entered into with messrs. G. H. Bailey, the Maltese people, provided they will co-operate,particularly by exercising wage restraint, stand a good chance of developing a reasonably healthy economy appreciably less dependenton United Kingdom expenditure and aid.14.      The next major step is to approve a detailed long-term development plan.    The late Maltese Government consistently refused to produce sucha plan.   The Governor has undertaken to produce one covering Governmentcapital expenditure during September,   In addition, we have asked the WorldBank, as an authority whose impartiality and integrity it would be difficulteven for Mr. Mintoff to impugn, to send a Mission to Malta during thenext few months to undertake a complete survey of Malta&apos;s economy andto make recommendations.   They are sending two representatives to malta in September to make a preliminary survey, on the basis of whichthe President will decide whether the bank can undertake a full survey.Once we know what the requirements are we shall be able to decide whatand how United kingdom m financial aid should in future be given.   GivenMalta&apos;s lack of natural resources, developing the Maltese economy will be difficult and slow.15.      In the meantime, our officials are examining the financing of next year&apos;s budget and longer term problems so far as practicable in theabsence of a development plan.   The Governor mentions a figure of 7 millions as the price for remaining in Malta.   His figure excludes the conversion of the dockyard.   The total cost of his proposals for at least the next two years is therefore  9 millions per annum.   We do not considerthat expenditure of this order would be practicable because of the physicallimitations on the Maltese Public Works Department, and the likelihood     ^that the demand for labour created by such a volume of annual expenditure-5-SECRET
in addition to the demand that will be made by the convxarsion of the dockyardand construction of N.A.T.O, underground storage would result in risingwage levels, thereby pricing Messrs. Baileys out of the ship-re pairingmarket.   Furthermore, financial assistance of this order, amounting toabout  30 per head of the Maltese population, would be wholly disproportionate-tionate to what other Colonies are receiving from the United Kingdom andwould add to the embarrassment that the present level of assistance alreadycauses us on this score.16.       There are other steps which should be taken.   The Malteseeconomy, apart from its natural weaknesses, has had imposed upon ittwo grave distortions which have been heavily criticised by every expertwho has visited Malta.   The first is the system of consumer subsidieswhich is so widespread and complicated as to distort the whole eco:nomyfand which is in effect kept in existence by United Kingdom aid.   Theabsurdity of the system is illustrated by the refusal of Maltese ministers to abolish, subsidies even in respect of commodities whose price had fallen below that at which they were being sold in Malta.   We fully realise the social and political implications of reforming the system of consumersubsidies, but we are convinced that it is indefensible in its present form,and that some change must be made.17.       The other is the highly restrictive system of housing allocation,rent, and building control which has completely discouraged privateenterprise from house-building and has reduced house construction tofifty houses per annum over the past two years.   Here the essential first step must be to reform the system of housing and rent control so as to revive private building, which in turn should help with the employmentposition.   The Governor is preparing legislation and plans to this effect.18.       Finally, an overhaul is necessary of Maliafefinancial system,which is antiquated and inflexible.   A review of taxation, which has notbeen increased since 1948, is overdue.   The Governor*s staff will, however,have to be increased to cope with this, and the Colonial Office are providinghim with a Financial Adviser who could take responsibility for financialand economic matters.19.      A means of advertising Malta to outside investors is required, anda small committee of industrialists, with Lord Hives as Chairman, andMr. Brand of Lazards as a member, has been set up, with aims similarto those of Lord Chandos&apos; Northern Ireland Development Council.   Toback the efforts of this Committee advice is being sent to the Governoron pioneer industry legislation (The Aids to Industries Bill to which herefersj: which he wishes to enact.20.       Since the Emergency was proclaimed we have made considerable progress in laying the foundation for the future.   We are convinced that future expenditure, unless based on a sound development plan and related to Malta&apos;s future real economic needs, will merely perpetuate the unplannedexpenditure of the Mintoff era and if anything make it more difficultto put Malta on her feet economically.21.      The success of all these measures will, however, depend- onpositive action to bring about a resumption of emigration, for unlessMalta&apos;s population is kept reasonably stable, the prospects of making herviable are nil.   On this proposals areawaited from the Governor.-6-SECRET
22.      The Minister of State for Colonial Affairs feels that until weare once more in a position to consult the Maltese about their financialand economic as well as about their constitutional future there will be continuing difficulty in reaching final decisions on a policy regardingUnited Kingdom long-term financial relationships with Malta.   In themeantime we are agreed that it is important that we should reach agreement on the United Kingdom side on what is to be the basiscfour scheme for capital development in Malta.   It will not be possiblehowever to have any full   discussion until a development plan (we hopeby the International Bank) gives a firm basis;  but there will undoubtedly be pressure for some preliminary discussion at the constitutional talks in November.23.      If our colleagues endorse the substance of this paper a substantive reply to the Governor will be prepared.D.H.A.P.1st September, 1958
