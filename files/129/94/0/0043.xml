secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   September 1958C. (58) 19324th September, 1958TRANSPORT: EFFECT OF THE RECESSIONMemorandum by the Minister of Transport and Ctvil AviationAs was only to be expected the severe cuts in activity that have followed theAmerican recession have had their repercussions on all forms of transport. Duringthe summer months the recession has bitten more deeply than many people realise.Although the American economy may be climbing out of the trough, this cancertainly not be said of the position as measured in terms of transport in thiscountry. I thought, therefore, that my colleagues should be aware of the presentposition.The Air Corporations2. British European Airways. B.E.A. with its many ramifications has been severely affected by the recession. It is a considerable consolation, however, thatas far as we know it has none the less done a good deal better than most of its competitors. But the falling-off in traffic has been severe 14 per cent, less than last year between London and Paris, for example; 6  per cent, less on the services to Austria and Switzerland, and 29 per cent, less on the Irish Sea local routes, mainly to the Isle of Man. All of these routes were expected to show good increases oftraffic.3. Last year the Corporation made a profit of  1 million. Following an investigation with the Chairman, Lord Douglas, of their financial position he has agreed with me that as their target for this year they will do their utmost to remain on the credit side of the ledger, but they certainly will not make a large profit.4. British Overseas Airways Corporation. On the North Atlantic with theintroduction of more modern aircraft and the economy class fare B.O.A.C.&apos;s figures have improved by no less than 22 per cent, compared with an increase of only8^ per cent, for all airlines on this route. In the first three months of the neweconomy services B.O.A.C.&apos;s traffic was 29 per cent, higher than last year.Unfortunately on the rest of B.O.A.C.&apos;s routes where the economy class fare has yet to be introduced the position is much less favourable. However, with thecoming of the Comet and a forceful sales policy, Sir Gerard d&apos;Erlanger, theChairman, has agreed with me that B.O.A.C.&apos;s target for this year can only beto have a smaller deficit than last year&apos;s, which was  2 - 8 million. On the availablefigures B.O.A.C. are doing better than most of their competitors, and bothCorporations have made economies in staff and expenditure.The British Transport commission. Here the position is a serious one because in the present vulnerablefinancial position of the Commission any setback would be bound to be extremelydamaging. In general the position is that the Commission have fulfilled their obligations to make the painful economies necessary to cover the recent wagesaward and to meet the expected drop in their receipts. These calculations have,however, been completely falsified by the unexpectedly large drop in bulk traffics,particularly coal, minerals and on Government account.  These are not losses toCopy No.CABINET54074
the roads or to other forms of transport. It is just that the tonnages are not thereto be moved. For example, the reduction on these traffics below the Commission^estimate has reduced their receipts by about  700,000 a week.6. My officials have been discussing this position with the Commission overthe past few weeks and are now in consultation with the Treasury. The positioncan hardly be blamed on the Chairman, Sir Brian Robertson, or the Commissionand is made the more difficult by the fact that to blame it on to a recession in thecoal and steel industries might not be good for the strength of sterling or our general economic position overseas. I would only say at the moment that I will of course bring this matter back to the Cabinet as soon as we have reachedconclusions as to the various possibilities of meeting this serious situation.H. W.Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation, W. 1,23rd September, 1958.
