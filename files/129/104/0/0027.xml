confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1961C. (61) 27 Copy No. 3 g28th February, 1961CABINETIMMUNITIES AND PRIVILEGES FOR commonwealth organisaitons IN THE UNITED kingdom memorandum by the Secretary of State for CommonwealthRelationsOn 5th May, 1960, my predecessor circulated a memorandum to the Cabinet(C. (60) 77) on the subject of diplomatic immunity for Commonwealth Ministers onvisits here, as a result of which a Bill is now before Parliament.2. In paragraph 5 of that memorandum he mentioned a request by theCommonwealth Economic Committee for as favourable treatment over incometax, &amp;c, for the Chairman and employees of the Committee, not normally resident in the United Kingdom, as is given to international organisations under theInternational Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950. The 1950 Actis inapplicable to Commonwealth bodies both because section 1 (1) limits it toorganisations of which the United Kingdom &quot; and one or more foreign sovereignPowers &quot; are members; and because the proviso to section 1 (2) prevents theconferring of any immunities or privileges greater than are required in order togive effect to an international agreement and so far no Commonwealth body isbased on an agreement containing requirements of this kind.3. On 10th May, 1960, the Cabinet invited the Commonwealth Secretary inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give further consideration tothe question of according diplomatic immunities to Commonwealth organisationsestablished in the United Kingdom.4. In the intervening period, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and I have considered the possibility of exempting the proposed salaried Chairman of theCommonwealth Economic Committee, when drawn from one of the other commonwealth countries, from United Kingdom income tax on his emoluments;and of dealing in the same way with the holders of other similar appointments,such as the Director of the Commonwealth Education Liaison Unit. However, theChancellor has found himself unable to agree to this proposal.5. On further consideration, it now seems to me that it would not in anycase be sufficient to deal only with the narrow question of liability to UnitedKingdom income tax, even though this was the particular point raised in the firstinstance by the Commonwealth Economic Committee.6. Commonwealth bodies jointly run by Commonwealth Governments areexcellent practical examples of Commonwealth co-operation. We should give them all the encouragement we can and build up their prestige. We recognised0he need for this at Montreal when we decided to bring the existing economicconsultative machinery under the aegis of the Commonwealth EconomicConsultative Council and to provide Marlborough House for meetings in London.But we cannot hope to buildup Commonwealth bodies so long as we continue to treat them as in some way inferior to international organisations, thereby implying that in practice we do not attach the same importance to them.58571
7. If we are to build up these organisations it is essential that we should beable to draw into their service first-class men from Commonwealth countries. Thenumber of such men that are available to work in Commonwealth or international institutions is limited. Unless we can give the senior staff of commonwealth organisaitons, recruited from overseas, a status and treatment equal to that whichinternational civil servants receive, we shall have great difficulty in getting menof the right calibre.; &apos;8. The two individuals whom I have at present in mind as beneficiaries froma concession are the proposed salaried Chairman of the Commonwealth EconomicCommittee and the Director of the Commonwealth Education Liaison Unit. Ihave reason to believe that the latter, a distinguished Indian, will not be preparedto remain in the present conditions when his period of office expires next year,and that it will be difficult to find any satisfactory successor on the present terms!Moreover, while there is reason to think that the Commonwealth EconomicCommittee might be able to fill their Chairmanship initially on the terms now available, we must expect the Committee to pursue the issue of principle.9. Commonwealth representatives feel strongly on this matter. We can,therefore, expect the pressure for fairer treatment to increase. However, although I would hope that the number of beneficiaries of any concession would increase asCommonwealth bodies here develop, it would never be more than a handful.10. In my view, Commonwealth organisations in the United Kingdom shouldbe put in a position similar to that enjoyed by international organisations underthe 1950 Act and to this end we should introduce legislation in the form of a commonwealth Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Bill.1:1?. While I am aware that immunities and privileges are not popular inParliament, I cannot believe that there would be trouble over a proposition whichamounts to- no. more, than putting Commonwealth organisations in as good aposition as, those including: foreign Governments.1:2. I therefore seek the agreement of my colleagues to the introduction oflegislation as proposed. If this is agreed to we could suitably let the PrimeMinisters of other Commonwealth Governments know our intention in confidencewhen they are in London next month.D.
