SEC*ff\!E document is the property of her britannic majest y&apos;s government)copy no.    y*PC.(61) 199th February, 1961CABINETTALLY CLERKSMemoranditm by the Minister of LabourMy colleagues will recall that on 31st January I was authorisedto inform the National Dock Labour Board that they would have the supportof the Government in carrying out their proposal to alloca-te both tallyclerks and docker-checkers to particular sectors of the London docks(C. C. (61) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 7).    This I did, and the London Boardthen informed the union officials of their intention.   The strength of the reaction from the unions has taken the Boards by surprise, and the LondonBoard have been constrained temporarily to postpone formal notificationto the men of the proposed allocation to sectors.   It is unfortunately clearthat the problem must be re-examined with great care.2.         The stevedores&apos; union were thought likely to dislike theproposals but not to oppose them actively.   But they have now told theemployers that they would instruct their members (including docker cas well as tally clerks) to refuse allocation.   This threat, if carried out,would almost certainly precipitate a strike which would spread throughoutthe London docks.3.        Although I had been assured personally by Mr. Cousins andMr. 0&apos;Leary of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union that they would support the proposals (for which their representatives voted both on theLondon and on the National Boards) officials of the union who deal directly with the tally clerks have informed the London Board that in the event of afurther strike the union would support the men.   This wholly unforeseendevelopment appears to arise partly from internal jealousies within theunion and partly from total failure of communications within it.Mr. Cousins has been the victim of influenza, and I am not able to see himuntil tomorrow;  and only then shall I be able to assess the situation.4.        At this stage I do not feel able to make any specific recommendationbut I felt that my colleagues should be aware of the difficulty t hat has arisen.I hope to make a further oral report to Cabinet in the light of my talk withMr. Cousins.o.        There is no doubt that a head-on collision leading to an officialstrike in the London docks would be a serious matter indeed.   The principalalternative to the method recommended in the Lloyd Williams&apos; Report isto increase the number of tally clerks substantially, so that the strengthof their monopoly position is broken.   I believe that in the short run this could be done without risk of a serious collision;   but there is the majordisadvantage that it would not dispose finally of the problem.   Recruitmentwould have to be maintained in the face of opposition as wastage took place.j. h.Ministry of Labour, S.W.I.8th February, 1961
