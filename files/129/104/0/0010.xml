confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1961C. (61) 10 Copy No.27th January, 1961.CABINETTALLY CLERKSMemorandum by the Minister of labour the four-weeks strike of tally clerks in the London Docks ended on17th October and the Committee I appointed during the course of the strikereported on 25th November. The Report strongly criticised the strikers and madea number of recommendations directed towards increasing efficiency in the Portby clipping the tally clerks&apos; wings.2. Since then, under considerable pressure from me, the London Dock labour board (a joint body of employers and unions set up under the Dock labour scheme) have been considering the Report as a matter of urgency. They have nowinformed the National Dock Labour Board that, with one exception (with whichI do not quarrel), they accept the recommendations of the Committee but they add that the implementation of some of these recommendations &quot; could be the causeof industrial unrest among the Tally Clerks &quot;. In particular, trouble is anticipatedover the proposal to allocate tally clerks to specified sectors of the Docks insteadof allowing them to pick and choose their sector at will.3. In these circumstances the National Board have asked me whether theycan be assured of support from the Government in putting through these reformsas they wish to do, and I would like to give them this assurance as soon as possible.4. It seems to me clear that something must be done to reduce the strangleholdwhich the tally clerks have over the industry, and that the sooner this is done the better from every standpoint. If nothing is done further trouble on issues of theirown choosing is to be expected from the tally clerks in due course when theirmorale and finances have recovered. It is better therefore to risk a showdown nowin the cause of increasing the efficiency of the Port.5. Constitutionally the decision is for the National Dock Labour Board totake and they are prepared to take it so long as they are assured that if troubleoccurs we shall not force them to back down. The Transport and General Workers&apos;Union will do their best to put the new proposals over to the workers, though wecannot expect the other union (the Stevedores) to be more than passive.6. It is difficult to say with certainty how serious the chances of trouble maybe, or what form it might take. I feel however that we cannot leave the tally clerksin complete possession of the field after their irresponsible and damaging actionof last autumn, and that if trouble does occur public opinion will be fully behindus in supporting the Board in measures to improve the efficiency of the Port.7. I took the opportunity of raising this at the Economic Policy Committeeon 25th January and my colleagues there agreed with the views I am putting forward. I now ask for the agreement of the Cabinet that I should inform theNational Dock Labour Board accordingly.J. H.Ministry of Labour,27th January, 1961.58397
