THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1961C. (61) 1 Copy No.   5 916th January, 1961CABINETCOST OF THE HEALTH service memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland, the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food andthe Minister of health on 21st December the Cabinet asked for further consideration to be givento the proposals in C. (60) 193 for increasing the charges for welfare milk andprescriptions in the light of the suggestions made in discussion (C.C. (60) 65thConclusions, Minute 4).2. One suggestion was that the welfare milk subsidy should be abolishedaltogether, so achieving approximately the same total saving without any increasein the prescription charge. We do not favour this course. To abolish the wholeof the present subsidy would have a severe impact on the milk producing industryif, as is probable, it caused a marked immediate reduction in the consumption of milk by mothers and young children, and the extra cost on the agricultural Voteswould substantially reduce the total net saving.3. The second suggestion that the subsidy should be completely abolishedfor certain classes but increased for others is open in a lesser degree to the sameobjections; and although there are nutritional grounds (paragraph 6 below) fordiscriminating in favour of the larger families, those grounds are not such as tojustify any actual increase in the subsidy. This would therefore be a very difficultcourse to defend on its merits.4. It seems to us accordingly that a total saving of the order decided on bythe Cabinet cannot be achieved without the suggested increase in the prescriptioncharge. On the other hand we consider that the proposals relating to welfare milkcan and should be modified, in accordance with the third suggestion made in cabinet, so as to enable the larger families to continue to obtain welfare milk atthe present price. Families with four or more children were specifically mentioned.Further examination has convinced us that this course is not only practicable butalso desirable on nutritional as well as political grounds.5. The Committee on the Medical and Nutritional Aspects of Food policy have specified families with four or more children as those whose present level of nutrition justifies &quot; watchful concern &quot;. It is therefore these families for whomsome special arrangement is desirable on medical grounds. On the other hand,where there are three or fewer children in a family, the intake of protein andcalcium would still be above the present levels for larger families even ifexpenditure on milk did not increase at all following reduction of the subsidy.6. The family allowance system of the Ministry of Pensions and national insurance would enable families with four or more children to be identified for thepurposes of the welfare milk scheme, though apart from the initial cost about 140extra staff would be required at Newcastle. It would take some four months fromthe date of a decision to bring the new arrangements into operation, provided thatthe necessary printing could be done in time.58332
7. On this footing we should, from the beginning of June, charge 6d. a pint(i.e., an extra 2d.) for all welfare milk, except that the. charge would remain at 4d.a pint for families with four or more children within the scope of the family allowances, and for families with three such children where the mother is pregnant.(The National Assistance Board&apos;s free milk scheme would remain unaffected.) the concession would reduce by about  2\ millions (i.e., to about  9 millions) the savingachieved in a full year.  In 1961-62 the saving would be about  6^ millions.&apos;&apos; u8. Arrangements on these lines seem to us wholly to meet the case for helping the larger families and to be an improvement on the original proposals. Accordinglywe propose that:(a) from the beginning of June the price of liquid welfare milk should beincreased from 4d. to 6d. a pint except that for larger families as definedabove it should remain at 4d.; and(b) from 1st April the prescription charge should be increased from Is. to 2s.per item.9. As a result of the above modifications and of recent adjustments to Estimatesthe total of the Health Estimates for 1961-62, as presented, will no longer fall below,but will be  10 millions above, the corresponding figure for 1960-61, even after allthe changes proposed or agreed have been taken into account.S.
