. .&quot;. CUMENT l  THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1961Copy No.60CABINETPUBLIC expenditure memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer in my early days as Chancellor of the Exchequer, I asked that an estimateshould he made of expenditure for the next three years, to enable me to judge whattaxation changes might be practicable, in what conditions, during this period. I found, moreover, that the Committee on the Control of Public Expenditure underthe Chairmanship of Lord Plowden had just made a report to my predecessor,the essence of which was the need to examine public expenditure as a whole,in relation to resources, and over a period of time, instead of by piecemeal decisions on individual proposals for expenditure: I am circulating this report separately(C. (61) 44).2. At a preliminary discussion in Cabinet on 29th (November (C.C. (60)60th Conclusions) I undertook to study future trends in Government expenditurein relation to national resources. I have now surveyed the field, with the help ofthe Colonial Secretary, the Minister of Housing and Local Government and theMinister of Labour (who were asked by the Prime Minister to assist me in thismatter). This memorandum sets out the position as I see it in the light of these discussions.I-The Growth of Expenditure3. First, the Treasury prepared for us a Public Expenditure Survey, stretchingfive years ahead. It proved desirable to include the whole of public expenditurehowever financed spending from the Exchequer above and below the line, thepayments by the National Insurance Funds, the current and capital expenditureof local authorities and tire capital expenditure of nationalised industries. TheExchequer and other sources of finance for the various public services are sointerlocked that these services cannot be considered in terms of Exchequerexpenditure alone. Local rates and national insurance contributions are partof the tax burden in the wide sense, and to try to deal with the services in termsof the Exchequer alone would mean considering the way in which certainexpenditure is partially financed rather than the expenditure itself, i.e., general grant instead of education expenditure, Exchequer contribution to the national insurance Fund instead of pensions, nationalised industries&apos; borrowing instead ofthe investment that calls for the borrowing.4. The economic impact of these expenditures differs. Some representpurchases by public authorities of goods and services for current consumption employment of, e.g., soldiers, teachers, scientists, civil servants, and the purchaseof, e.g., weapons, hospital supplies, office equipment: some represent investment e.g., roads, power stations, technical colleges. These are the direct demands thatthe public sector makes on national resources. Another group of expenditurerepresents &quot; transfer&quot; payments to individuals e.g., pensions, debt interest,agricultural subsidies. Another, e.g., economic aid, represents payments to peopleoverseas: and thus has a direct impact on the balance of payments. Again, someof this public expenditure can be regarded as producing a return to the nationalC. (61) 4323rd March, 196158740B
economy; even the investment of nationalised industries, however, which is mostakin to &quot; remunerative &quot; investment in economic terms, rarely yields as much ashalf the normal return on private investment.5. In preparing the Survey, the Treasury had to make two generalassumptions:i\Vk ^ ^e rate -0* Sro&apos;wt,h 0^ gross domestic product (G.D.P.) per worker in1960-65 would be 2\ per cent, per year, which, with a growth ofworking population of 0-4 per cent, per year would give a growth oftotal G.D.P. of about 2-9 per cent, per year. (There would be similargrowth in the gross national product (G.N.P.), i.e., the gross domestic product plus net investment income from overseas.)(ii) The rate of increase of salaries and wages per worker would be about per cent, per year (rates of pay rising by a little over 4 per cent., and earnings a little more because of bonus payments, upgrading, &amp;c.).6. These assumptions are considered below: they imply an increase of about-7 per cent, per year in prices, virtually the same rate of increase as in 1952-59.7. The projections of future expenditure are in some cases (notably defence,public sector investment, education, health) derived from &quot; forward looks&quot; whichhave been undertaken in co-operation with the Departments in the last year; in others (e.g., central administration) the Treasury have themselves made an estimate;in ethers again (e.g., agricultural support and overseas economic aid) where it isimpossible to make any rational forecast of what expenditure would result fiveyears ahead from continuation of existing policy, the 1960-61 figure has been repeated. A contingency allowance has been added both to take account of this last category and to provide some margin for the inevitable appearance of newneeds and changes in circumstances.8. The total public expenditure for 1961-62 is estimated at  10,450 millions, ofwhich about two-thirds is met from the Exchequer. Estimated on the basis described above, it is likely to reach about  13,000 millions in 1965-66, an increase at the rateof over 5^ per cent, a year. This is in fact somewhat greater than the rate of increase of 4J per cent, a year in the period 1952-59.II. Public Expenditure and Gross National Product9. We next considered the implications of this prospective growth of public expenditure both for taxation and for the long-term economic problems. Thisleads straight to consideration of the &quot; weight of taxation &quot;, which for the purposeof this paper is defined as the proportion which total receipts from taxation(including local rates and national insurance contributions) bear to the G.N.P.10. &quot; Weight of Taxation &quot;. Experience suggests that, if public expenditurerises faster than G.N.P., the &quot; weight&quot; of taxation (as defined above) is likely torise over a period of years. In any one particular year, the current &quot; weight oftaxation &quot; will be affected by decisions taken in the light of the short-term economicsituation about the levels of budget surpluses and deficits which are appropriate.But, over a period of years, the trend of expenditure has proved to be the dominatinginfluence.11. The following table shows the recent past and prospective course of public expenditure:19521957195819591960-611965Public Expenditure as a percentage of G.N.P.45-540-140-942-542-544-0
12. Thus in the first six years of the post-war Conservative administrations,public expenditure as a percentage of G.N.P. fell by nearly 5-  points. This resultedmainly from the big cuts in defence, but also from the reduction in local authority housing after the great efforts of 1952 and 1953. From 1957 onward, however,the ratio has been rising, since there are no longer any important contractingprogrammes. The ratio is now 42-5 per cent., compared with 45-5 per cent, in1952.13. In the same period, central government taxes have fallen from 30-2 percent, of G.N.P. to 26-1 per cent. The total &quot; weight of taxation &quot;, which we defineto include local rates and national insurance contributions, fell from 36 - 4 per cent,of G.N.P. in 1952 to 33-8 per cent, in 1959 a similar fall to that in the expenditureratio. This broad correspondence between the ratios of expenditure and taxationto G.N.P. does not, of course, mean that every kind of public expenditure has to be financed by taxation; of course there are public expenditures which can properly be financed by borrowing. But if over a long period these expenditures are very heavy, they create pressures on the economy that are likely to be reflected in the taxation required to combat inflation.14. In the next four years, the expenditure ratio is expected to increase from42-5 per cent, to 44 per cent, (it will be well up in 1961-62). If, in accordance with previous experience, it was necessary for the &quot; weight of taxation &quot; to follow, thiswould mean the raising by taxation of an additional sum of the order of  450millions over and above what the yield of taxation would be if its &quot; weight&quot;remained constant.15. Development of the Economy. The size and shape of prospective public expenditure is of decisive importance for the development of the economy. Theefficiency of public services is a significant element in the national product and competitive power: but the public expenditure must necessarily compete for limited resources with the needs for expansion of private consumption, private investment and exports. The days are long past when it could be said that all public expenditure was &quot; bad &quot; and all private expenditure was &quot; good &quot;: but it remainstrue that the more resources the public sector takes, the less there will be for theprivate sector, and that in particular the development of exports depends almostentirely on initiative in the private sector.16. In order to analyse this further, the Treasury have constructed a numberof &quot; patterns &quot; of the five-year trends in the economy from 1959-60 to!965. It isnow possible, with the use of the National Physical Laboratory computer, to carryout this kind of analysis with much more assurance and in much greater detailthan hitherto.17. These &quot; patterns &quot; do not of course purport to predict the future, whichis predictable only to a very limited extent. What they do is to bring out clearly the relationship between different parts of the economy, and how, for example,the courses of wages, prices, investment and exports are likely to inter-act. these new techniques enable us to measure the implications of present trends for thefuture course of the economy and so identify the points that are likely to cause trouble.18. Most of the &quot; patterns &quot; constructed by the Treasury proved to containcritical inconsistencies, or to require changes in trend which seemed entirely unlikelywithout major changes in social attitudes. The one of them which seemed to havethe greatest degree of realism in the assumptions, on which it was based, and which seemed to throw up the least in the way of inconsistencies and inherentimprobabilities, contained the following basic features:(i) Public sector&apos;s direct claims on national resources growing at 3-1 percent, per annum (compared with an average of 0-6 per cent, perannum in 1952-59): this is similar to the growth of public expenditure(paragraph 14).(ii) G.N.P. growing at 2-9 per cent, per annum (paragraph 5) 2-5 per cent.per annum in G.N.P. per worker (productivity) and 0-4 per cent, perannum in labour force.(iii) Increase of earnings at 5 per cent, per annum (paragraph 5), and pricesrising at 2-7 per cent, per annum (paragraph 6).58740
(iv) Private investment growing at 3-7 per cent, per annum (manufacturing industry faster).(v) Private consumption rising at 2 per cent, per head per annum (comparedwith 2-8 per cent, per head per annum in recent years).(vi) Volume of exports growing at 5-4 per cent, per annum (compared with -8 per cent, per annum in 1952-59).19. Apart from (vi) this &quot; pattern &quot; is reasonably realistic. The 2\ per cent,per annum rate of growth of G.N.P. per worker is a reasonable rate for high-incomes, high-welfare, high-service, high-defence countries it is a little faster thanthe most authoritative recent United States assessment of their prospect, and it ismuch the same as the Scandinavians&apos; rate. It is much faster than our pre-warrate. Again, the assumption in (iii) that pay will rise faster than productivityconforms with past experience: if these could be brought into line it wouldrevolutionise our problems, but there is no sign of it. The &quot; pattern &quot; envisages in(iv) a continuation of the rapid growth of manufacturing investment: the slowingof the growth of consumption in (v) may well be too optimistic, implying a continuing rise in the proportion of incomes saved.20. But the balance of payments weakness is alarming. To increase exportvolume by 5\ per cent, per annum (i.e., doubling the rate of growth from 1952-59)with the internal price-level rising by say 15 per cent, in five years and withunchanged tenns of trade is stiff indeed. But unless this can be achieved wecannot afford to buy the imports needed to sustain a growth of G.N.P. of 3 percent, per annum (and do our share of economic aid); the consequences would bethat we should be forced to restrict growth in order to sustain sterling.21. The conclusion is that this &quot;pattern&quot; with 3 per cent, per annum rateof increase of G.N.P., and the public expenditure rising from 42^ per cent, to44 per cent., is beyond what we can realistically hope to achieve at any rateunless there were to be so great a growth of our efficiency and competitive power as seems most unlikely of achievement. Nor is there any other &quot; pattern&quot;,consistent with this course of public expenditure, which can realistically be saidto present a better prospect. In other words, on present trends and policies,notably in wages, consumption and public expenditure, we cannot see a sound basis for our economy in the years ahead.22. Public Expenditure. Among the many factors which contribute to our economic future the only one over which the Government have clear responsibility and control is public expenditure. The share of public authorities in the wholeeconomic process is so large that the way in which the Government handle their activities and expenditures may well be decisive to the outcome of the next fiveyears. The scale can be illustrated as follows:(i) Public expenditure is 42^ per cent, of G.N.P. i.e., this is the proportionof total national expenditure spent by central and local governmentand on the nationalised industries&apos; investment.(ii) About one-quarter of the national output of goods and services is boughteither by central and local government or by the nationalised industries for capital purposes; this is substantially more than total exports ofgoods and services.(iii) Public authorities employ about one-quarter of the total working population about two-thirds as many as the whole of manufacturing industry. The nationalised industries alone, including the Post Office,employ over 2 million people with capital assets of nearly  7,000millions: and their annual capital investment is about the same asthat of the whole of manufacturing industry.23.   The sort of questions which come to mind are:(i) If there is going to be an increase in the &quot; weight of taxation&quot;, as isimplied by the public expenditure prospect if previous experience isrepeated, what will be the effect upon initiative and enterprise, and upon the prospect of increasing. the rate of economic growth?
(ii) To what extent is the prospective pattern of public expenditure, in theaggregate and in detail, likely to contribute to the growth of theG.N.P. (and, in parallel, to the strengthening of the balance ofpayments)? In some cases, e.g., technical education, public expenditureclearly does so contribute. But on the other hand does it in other cases tend, in detail, to shift labour and capital from activities with high economic productivity to activities with low economicproductivity? Is it likely, in the aggregate, to leave enough resources available for the expansion of private consumption, private investment and exports?In short, the question of the future size and shape of public expenditure and theactivities of the various public authorities goes much wider than the questionof taxation: it is the question of how the Governments direct influence on the economy, through ownership and spending power, is to be used, and with whatpurpose, during the next five years.24. Size and Direction of Future Spending. On size, it is clear that evenif G.N.P. rises at 3 per cent, per year, the present implication, on previous experience, is an increase in the &quot; weight of taxation &quot;. The sum involved wouldbe about  450 millions in a projected 19651 expenditure of, say,  13,000 millions.If we could moderate the expenditure growth to 3 per cent, per annum in &quot; real &quot;terms instead of 4 per cent, (the &quot; real&quot; equivalent of the 5i per cent, inparagraph 8), or to 20 per cent, in &quot; money &quot; terms by 1965 instead of 25 per cent.,this would be likely to make it possible to stabilise the &quot; weight of taxation &quot;.25. The prospect would still be precarious, for there would be no great margin of resources of labour and capital to be thrown into investment or exports if theposition turned for the worse or if industry had to accept lower export prices tomeet the gruelling competition or if the terms of trade turned against us. Moreover,if G.N.P. rose by less than 3 per cent, per annum, we should be likely to have to face an increase in the &quot; weight of taxation &quot; all the same.26. The direction of future spending, however, is at least as important as theaggregate size; and it may well be that a series of specific policies, in crucial parts ofthe public sector from the point of view of the national economic prospects, couldyield large returns.HI-The Layout of Public Expenditure27. It is not for this paper to formulate the policies or to outline a strategy for dealing with these far-reaching and difficult problems. It is useful at this stage,however, to review briefly the whole field of public expenditure, indicating the considerations which have to be taken into account when we examine the impact of each block of expenditures upon the national economic prospects.28. The nationalised industries are of outstanding significance because oftheir huge State-owned capital and investment and labour force (see paragraph22 (iii)) and their pervasive influence through the economy. If we can give themeffective financial objectives, and keep them to it, and make them carry out their investment and manage their labour force and conduct their business generally withconcentration on paying their way on the lines developed by the nationalised industries Committee this can make a difference to the Exchequer of many scoresof   millions a year, and much more to their contribution to the growth of G.N.P.. 29. The considerations in paragraph 23 (ii) need careful application to assistance to private industry and agriculture. We are spending over  400 millions a year on this assistance. There is a real question whether our present policies tendto keep labour and capital in low-productivity activities activities which eithershow an entirely uneconomic rate of return, or at any rate could not and wouldnot be carried on with people&apos;s own money without Government financial backing.Of course there are important social considerations, and we all recognise the need to help the small farmer and the workers in depressed industry and to preserve thesocial capital in derelict industrial areas. But if we go beyond doing what isnecessary by these standards, we may find ourselves actively encouraging thetransfer of labour and capital from remunerative work to unremunerative work ina degree which is damaging both to the national economy and to the real interestsof the individuals concerned. Expenditures of this kind carry the risk of weakening
rather than strengthening the economy and need to be scrutinised with particular care.30. In Government science and technology the same sort of question must beasked. A large proportion of the nation&apos;s best scientists and technologists, and themost energetic industrial management, is concentrated on non-economic work-work of only incidental commercial value. Defence research and developmenttake about  225 millions a year; the total research and development effort of private industry is only  125 millions- 150 millions a year. The Atomic Energy Authority&apos;civil research and development are over  50 millions a year; the nationalisedenergy industries between them ;spend only about  6 millions. Is this deployment of our scarcest resources, which flows directly from the Government^ power of thepurse, helpful to our exports and competitive power?31. The expenditures in support of external policy defence and overseaseconomic aid, &amp;c. carry the special economic disadvantage of striking directly atthe balance of payments (defence notably through the pre-emption of industrial resources otherwise needed for investment and exports, and also military expenditure overseas: likewise overseas economic aid, of which some of theadvantages for under-developed countries could be obtained by freer importpolicies, particularly for manufactures, by the advanced countries.)32. The social services in general, on the other hand, have had less directdistorting effect upon the deployment of our industrial resources. Their economicand financial problem is for the most part the relatively straightforward one of finding the right balance between services and taxation (both central governmentand local authority). Education and health are much the most important(beginning to approach  1,000 millions a year each, in current costs alone): thepractical problem is to contain the rate of growth of these services within our long-term economic capability, and to get the right balance in their investment programmes. Services like roads and police present similar problems, and so dopensions and assistance. It would be sensible to examine the long-term developmentof all the social services together and, in parallel with this, that of all the localgovernment services together.33. Expenditure on central administration follows the demand forGovernment services. There are, however, nearly 1^ million people engaged in central and local government and their efficiency is an important element in thethe total G.N.P.34. The only other big expenditure is debt interest. Experience has shown the impracticability of trying to keep rates of interest lower than the market would justify: but, at over  1,200 millions a year and increasing, debt interest (central and local government and public corporations) is a very important long-term item,and its importance is a consideration against relying too exclusively on monetarycontrols.IV. Conclusions35.   It seems that the conclusions to be drawn from this part of the studyare:(i) The public sector forms so large a part of our economy that the scale and character of its expenditure its effects upon the course of the economy and its demands on resources are of first-class importance to our economic growth and competitive power.(ii) The policies which the Government are at present pursuing mean that public expenditure as a whole will increase in the next five years faster than the estimate of growth of the G.N.P. (3 per cent, per annum)which, unless changes are made in these policies, is unlikely to proveattainable because of the increase in exports on which it depends.(iii) If the experience of the last decade is repeated, a disproportionately rapid increase of public expenditure would be likely to lead to an increasein the &quot; weight of taxation &quot; (the proportion which total receipts from taxation, including local rates and national insurance contributions,bear to the G.N.P.). On the illustrative figures of this paper, theincrease might be about  450 millions by 1965.
(iv) If the G.N.P. were to fail to rise at an average of 3 per cent, per annum(which would require an expansion nearly twice as fast in exports) our economy would undoubtedly be overloaded with public expenditure,with very serious implications for inflation and higher taxation.36. This paper is to put the situation before my colleagues. It is a situationrequiring action. The longer action is deferred, the more difficult it will become.Our next step should be to build up a &quot; plan &quot; for the development of the public sector and its expenditure in the next four years, and methods of financing it.This might for some services (e.g., defence, economic aid, education, health, roads)establish manageable rates of growth; for others new courses of policy (e.g.,nationalised industries, assistance to industry and agriculture) and so on. Thelong-term development of all the social services should be examined together;similarly, that of all the local government services should be examined together!In this way we could work towards a size and direction of public expenditure anddevelopment of the public sector which would make the best possible contribution in the aggregate and in detail to all our problems.S.
