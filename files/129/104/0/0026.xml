C. (61) 2624th February, 1961CABINETMALTA CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies my comments and recommendations on the proposals of the Commission formaltality under the Chairmanship of Sir Hilary Blood have been discussed in theColonial Policy Committee and in the Defence Committee. At the invitation ofthe Colonial Policy Committee I have now circulated a comparison of the singapore Constitution and the Blood Commission^ proposals (C. (61) 24). Theobject of this paper is to give my comments on the reactions of my colleagues on certain aspects of the Blood Commission^ proposals.2. I judge from these discussions that, while my colleagues are generallyprepared to concur in the main outline of the constitution recommended by the blood Commission, they have doubts on the following points:(a) The desirability of giving a Maltese Government concurrent powers in defence and external affairs;(b) The wisdom of delegating authority to conclude certain specified types ofinternational agreements; and(c) The desirability of dividing responsibilities and functions between a Headof State and a United Kingdom Commissioner.In addition some of my colleagues question the appropriateness of making astatement now, on the lines proposed in Annex A, on Malta&apos;s constitutional futurebeyond the next stage of advance.3. I comment on (a), in so far as concerns external affairs, and on (b) above in Annex B. Remaining anxieties on the score of giving the Maltese concurrentlegislative and executive authority appear to centre on the effect that thisarrangement may have on the proper maintenance of our defence interests in malta. On this, I commented to the Minister of Defence, in my minute of8th February, as follows :&quot; The proposal that the United Kingdom and Malta should haveconcurrent jurisdiction in matters of defence is, from the point of view of presentation, the lynch-pin of our case. But the abolition of&apos; reserved matters&apos;over which (as in the 1947 Constitution) the Maltese have no jurisdictionshould not, in my view and that of the Governor, result in any less effectiveUnited Kingdom control in the defence field. The responsibility for defence will remain firmly with the United Kingdom. The interpretation of &apos; defence &apos;will rest with us alone this is in fact an advance on the 1947 position fromthe defence point of view. The Head of State will be required to reserve forapproval in London any Bills affecting or appearing to us to affect the dischargeof our defence responsibilities. Further, the fact that the Maltese parliament will have competence to legislate over the defence field will help to reducethe area of friction between Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the maltese government to matters which are actually in dispute. The arrangement whereby the United Kingdom Commissioner will have both legislative and executive powers overriding those of the Maltese Government is different inCopy No.    j) ZjTH5S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  February 196158563
form, but not in substance, from the Singapore arrangement, where, you willrecall, the local Legislature alone is competent to legislate on defence matters.(There is no machinery of concurrent legislation in Singapore and our long-stop control is suspension of the Constitution.) &quot;4. I do not want to pitch too high a claim that this extension of thecompetence of the Maltese Legislature into the defence field will bring aboutthe co-operation on defence matters that was lacking between 1947 and 1958.But one of the aims of the proposal for concurrent powers is to give a new maltese government the feeling that they are not excluded from the defence field and that defence is properly a subject with which they should be prepared to concern themselves. This should appeal to moderate opinion in Malta and may wellendow the new constitutional relationship with that goodwill and dignity essentialto its proper functioning. If we are not to extend Maltese legislative competenceon the lines recommended, we can only go back to the old diarchical arrangement whereby the Maltese are completely excluded from these subjects. In practice this not only did not prevent effective Maltese obstructionism, but also failed to induce any real desire in the Maltese for co-operation between them and ourselves on the excluded subjects.5. On (c) of paragraph 2 above, it has already been agreed that the Governor(new type) should remain a non-Maltese at least so long as we consider it necessary,in our own interests, to retain in his hands the ultimate control of the police. I donot consider that the separation of authority between the proposed &quot; Head ofState &quot; and the United Kingdom Commissioner should be a hindrance to the latterin getting implemented in Malta decisions affecting our defence interests there.Sir Guy Grantham has given it as his view that the United Kingdom commissioner will be in no worse a position in this respect than was the Governor under the 1947Constitution and that the exercise of powers by a British authority entirelydissociated from the Maltese Government will be politically more acceptable. nor do I think that the creation of a separate &quot; Head of State &quot; will, of itself, encouragepressures which will undoubtedly show themselves in any case for furtherpolitical advance. On the contrary, in so far as a Constitution based on the blood Commission^ recommendations succeeds in attracting support at leastfrom moderate opinion in Malta, this should make it easier for us to fend offsuch demands until we are satisfied that we can yield to them without sacrificingour essential interests in Malta.6. As to the desirability of a statement about the ultimate future, the BloodCommission regarded themselves as precluded, in drawing up its recommendations,from looking beyond the next stage of constitutional advance. However, themembers of the Commission have strongly impressed upon me the desirability ofindicating, at the same time as their Report is published, a policy for the longer term future. They consider that this will greatly improve the chances of successof a constitution on the lines they recommend. This opinion has been reinforced by views expressed to me by many other observers of the Maltese scene. Notonly must we find some way of rallying moderate opinion in Malta to supportthe Blood Commission^ recommendations, but we must also take account of thefact that Malta, and particularly the younger generation in Malta, is no moreimmune from nationalist aspirations than any other territory.7. Our defence interests in Malta being so vital, I well understand the hesitancyfelt by some of my colleagues over committing ourselves on constitutional changesbeyond the immediate future. I have given consideration to the suggestion that myproposed form of words should be modified by adding the thought that we wouldbe prepared to concede the right of self-determination only when our defence interests permit this. I am ready to amend my earlier draft to make it clear thatthis right is only an eventual one; but I consider that any further modificationwould take away all its appeal to&apos; Maltese public opinion. We therefore have onlythese choices before us either to state plainly, and without qualification, that it isnot our policy to deny Malta at the appropriate time the right to self-determination,or to say nothing at ail at this stage about the longer term future. If we follow thelatter course it must be in the knowledge that the Blood Commission^ proposals will not of themselves satisfy the great majority of Maltese public opinion, and thatwe shall have added nothing to them which would induce moderate opinion to rallyto them and try to make them work. It is only right that I should add that theGovernor and his immediate advisers would prefer that nothing were said about
eventual self-determination and indeed about the next constitutional stage Myopinion is, however, that if I were able to do something about the future in the modified terms of Annex C to this paper, we should increase the chances of makingthe Blood Commission^ proposals acceptable, and we might also, I would hope&apos;take some of the heat out of the agitation for independence now. It may well bebecause we have never been prepared to say anything to the Maltese which offers the hope of self-determination at some time that this issue has assumed such importance in their eyes.I. MColonial Office, S.W.1,24 th February, 1961.Annex ADRAFT PARAGRAPHS ON FUTURE STATUS FOR PARLIAMENTARYSTATEMENTThe new Constitution will enable Malta to enjoy a very substantial degree ofself-government. It will moreover make provision for the removal, whencircumstances justify this, of interim restrictions on Maltese Ministers&apos;responsibilities for the police. It will establish, as the Commission puts it, apartnership between Malta and the United Kingdom, who will continue to beresponsible for Malta&apos;s defence and its external affairs. This partnership will workonly if the duly elected Maltese leaders want it to work and are ready to co-operate with Her Majesty&apos;s Government in ensuring that it does work. Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment for their part sincerely hope that this co-operation will be forthcomingand that there will thus be established between the Government of Malta and theGovernment of the United Kingdom the necessary degree of mutual confidencewhich will enable them at the appropriate time to work out together the next stage of constitutional advance in Malta. If the Blood Constitution works satisfactorilyand smoothly over the immediate period ahead, then Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentwill be ready to discuss with the Maltese Government of the day what that next stage should be.It is of course no part of Her Majesty&apos;s Governmenfs policy to deny to the maltese people the right to determine for themselves their own destiny in associationwe hope with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth family. But theimmediate aim must be the restoration of elections and a substantial measure ofself-government.Annex BMALTA:  EXTERNAL AFFAIRS AND COMMISSIONERS powers the Blood Commission^ proposals for external affairs coyer two aspects,namely a concurrent legislative power and a delegated executive authority tonegotiate certain types of international agreement and to apply for membership orassociate membership of certain international organisations.2. In so far as the legislative power is used to implement international agreements locally there is nothing new in it. Every Colonial Government, whatever its constitutional status, has this power; and even if external affairs were reservedwholly to the United Kingdom we would in all probability still, as under the 1947Maltese Constitution, rely upon legislation by the Maltese Legislature to give effectto Treaties applying to Malta. I do not think that, the Maltese having had this authority under their previous Constitution, we could now contemplate removing it;nor does our earlier experience of this arrangement suggest any need to do so.3. There is not likely to be much legislation on other external matters. In any event, I doubt whether we could avoid friction simply by reserving external affairsexclusively to the United Kingdom.  That would in itself not prevent a Maltese
Legislature from passing legislation trespassing on the reserved field, which weshould then have to challenge and argue out with the Maltese side. The BloodCommission^ proposals substitute for this cumbersome process a concurrent andoverriding legislative power, which we can use swiftly in case of need.4. On the executive side which is, of course, by far the more important aspect of this matter the Blood Commission proposes to meet the general Maltese desireto negotiate themselves such things as local trade agreements by delegating definedpowers to the Maltese Government, as was done in Singapore. The essence of thisarrangement is that it is the United Kingdom Government that decide the. extentof any delegation and define and police it. In Singapore this delegation of executive authority was set out by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in a despatch to the Singapore government. My intention would be to follow this procedure for Malta, althoughthe terms of the delegation, on which our Departments would of course consult and agree, may have to be varied to suit the different circumstances of Malta. delegation of authority to Colonial Governments to negotiate specific international agreementsis not a new departure; and Colonial Governments are already eligible for certain types of membership of a number of international organisations, more particularly the United Nations Specialised Agencies. The arrangement proposed for Maltadoes not therefore introduce any new concept; what it envisages is that we should state in terms that the Maltese Government may exercise delegated authority andjoin certain types of international organisations and indicate, and police, the preciseextent to which we agree to such delegation. Otherwise the handling of external relations will rest with Her Majesty&apos;s Government.5. No constitutional provisions that we can devise will prevent a maltese government from making a nuisance of themselves, in this as in other fields, if theyare so minded. Indeed, a non-co-operative Government could cause usembarrassment vis-a-vis foreign States even if there were no delegation of powers.The Blood Commission^ proposals are designed to go some way towards recognisingMalta&apos;s aspirations to play some part in her own external affairs and thereby toreduce the likelihood of a Maltese Government creating difficulties for us in matterson which we need their co-operation. I hope that you will agree that it is worthwhile making this gesture in an effort to achieve thereby co-operation which might otherwise be lacking; and that the safeguards that will exist against abuse of theproposed arrangements are fully adequate to protect our essential interests.February, 1961.Annex CREVISED DRAFT PARAGRAPHS FOR PARLIAMENTARY statement on FUTURE STATUSThe new Constitution will enable Malta to enjoy once more a very substantialdegree of self-government. It will establish, as the Commission put it, a partnership between Malta and the United Kingdom, who will continue to be responsible formaltality&apos;s defence and its external affairs. But this partnership will work only if theduly elected Maltese leaders want it to work and are ready to co-operate with her majesty&apos;s Government in ensuring that it does work. Her Majesty &quot;s Governmentfor their part sincerely hope that this co-operation will be forthcoming and thatthere will thus be established between the Government of Malta and the Governmentof the United Kingdom the necessary degree of mutual confidence which will enablethem at the appropriate time to work out together the next stage of constitutional advance in Malta. If the Blood Constitution works satisfactorily and smoothly overthe period ahead, then Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be ready to discuss with the maltese Government of the day how Malta can best move forward.It is of course no part of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy to deny to the maltese people the right at the appropriate time to determine for themselves theirown final status in association with the United Kingdom and the Commonwealthfamily. But the immediate aim must be the restoration of elections and a substantial measure of self-government.February, 1961.
