THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1961C. (61) 5 Copy No.    3  12th January, 1961CABINETFUTURE OF THE GAMBIAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Gambia consists of the Colony, a small area round Bathurst, the capital,which has been British for some 200 years, and the Protectorate, which has beenBritish for 65 years; this is no more than 20 miles wide at its maximum breadthbut it extends for some 180 miles inland on either bank of the Gambia River,right into the heart of Senegal, which lies on either side of it. There are altogetherabout 250,000 inhabitants.2. The people value the Commonwealth connexion but it is a backward andimpoverished country, dependent now on a grant-in-aid from us. It is obviouslya geographical anomaly and a thorn in Senegal&apos;s flesh. Its existence hinders the efficient use of the only important river in the area, makes it impossible to develop the only good natural harbour (Bathurst), creates a small enclave of territory whichcan only with difficulty sustain an economic existence and maintains an artificialbarrier between peoples of the same race.3. The Gambia is too small and too poor (65,000 tons of groundnuts are itsonly export) to become independent by itself. But when Sierra Leone becomesindependent next April it will (apart from Portuguese and Spanish possessions)be the only Colonial dependency, British or French, left in West Africa. Thepeople of Senegal on either side of it are racially the same. The Gambia Rivercould be of use to Senegal and economically the country would probably gain byjoining with Senegal, for they might get the benefit of the subsidised prices paidby France for the 800,000 tons or so of Senegalese groundnuts. Clearly there arestrong arguments for the Gambia joining Senegal.4. It is no light matter to suggest that a country which has been Britishfor many years should join a foreign country, and there would clearly be practicaldifficulties, of language, law and systems of administration. To harmonise thetwo economies would also have its problems. Nevertheless, I have beenreluctantly forced to the conclusion that some kind of association with Senegal isthe only possible future for the Gambia. Sierra Leone, its nearest Britishneighbour, is too far away (300 miles) and too weak financially to be able to take on this liability. Anyhow the geographical anomaly would remain, and the peopleof the Protectorate have no kinship with those of Sierra Leone.5. The Chiefs of Staff consider that, although it is desirable that we shouldnot prejudice our staging rights in Bathurst unless there are compelling reasonsfor doing so, there are no strategic reasons for obstructing association between theGambia and Senegal. They consider that it would be important to do what wecould to prevent the penetration of the resultant State by Powers hostile to theWest. Our Ambassador in Dakar advises that the present regime in Senegal underPresident Senghor and Premier Momadou Dia is well disposed towards the west and likely to pursue a moderate course in African and international affairs andnot to be receptive to Communist influence. The Senegalese authorities would welcome closer association with the Gambia. The people of the Gambia itselfdespite their attachment to the British connexion increasingly realise that their future must lie with Senegal.58323
6. The Governor and three of his; Ministers recently came here for financialtalks and during the course of these I took the opportunity to discuss this question with them. The Ministers were quite clear that it is one which must now be faced.A good deal of local discussion will be necessary before a generally acceptablepolicy crystallises, but the Ministers, who were of different parties, were agreedthat their country ought not to be merged completely with Senegal but should maintain some degree of separate identity and, if possible, its Commonwealthconnexion. They had in mind some kind of federal arrangement which wouldbe achieved gradually, leaving time for the two countries to grow together. Thefirst step might be assimilation of the two tariffs and interchangeability of thecurrencies (special arrangements will in any case have to be made for the Gambia&apos;scurrency when Sierra Leone becomes independent).7. Gambian Ministers at present have only limited powers and they want&quot; full internal self-government&quot; within the next year so that they will be able to talk to Senegalese Ministers on terms of reasonable equality. I have promised to talk with them about this some time in the summer. If things go well, I may at least be able to agree to the appointment of a Chief Minister. In the meanwhileI expect no startling developments.8. The Gambian Ministers are clearly right in thinking that the process of association should be a gradual one and the Governor and I would also wish to feel our way. It is difficult to see the end of the process. We must recognisethat, despite the present wishes of Gambia Ministers, it might well be completeintegration with Senegal and separation from the Commonwealth. I think wemust face this possibility. The people of the Gambia should of course know ofthe difficulties in maintaining the Commonwealth connexion if their relationship with Senegal takes the form of political union or federation and a final decisionon their future should not be taken until it is possible to determine clearly thewishes of the people.9. The Governor and I feel however that we must be ready to take an initialstep soon. My immediate proposal is that we should take the initiative to the extentof letting the people of the Gambia know that Her Majesty&apos;s Government do not rule out the possibility of their seeking a future with Senegal. The Governor has advisedand I agree with him that this would at least help to set minds working in the right direction. I would wish to leave the timing of any such statement open. It maywell be best not to make it until the talks about constitutional development, but itmight possibly be better made before that if a suitable occasion arises e.g., a speechby the Governor in his legislature.10. If my colleagues agree with my view on the future of the territory, I would propose to inform the Governor that Her Majesty&apos;s Governments view is that if,after the Gambia has advanced constitutionally, it appears to be the clearly expressedview of the inhabitants that their future lies in an association with Senegal, her majesty&apos;s Government would not stand in the way, but would assist in any way theycould in initiating discussions on the subject between Gambian and SenegaleseMinisters. I would ask the Governor to consult me further on the precise timing and nature of any public statement.11.   I shall be grateful for the approval of my colleagues to this course of action.I. M.Colonial Office, S.W.1,11th January, 1961.!
