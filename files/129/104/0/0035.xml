ANNUAL REVIEW AND determination of GUARANTEES, 19611. The 1961 Annual Review of the economic condition and prospects of theagricultural industry has been held in accordance with the Agriculture Act, 1947.I.   Economic Condition of the Agricultural industry the Course of Production2. Agricultural net output, which last year reached a new high level, hasshown a slight increase. On the new index of net output (1954/55 to 1956/57 ^100) introduced at the last Review, the forecast for 1960/61 is fractionally abovethe revised figure for last year of 114. On the index based on pre-war as 100,the forecast of net output for 1960/61 is 172, compared with the revised figure for last year of 169.3. The tillage at June, 1960 was higher than in 1959 with a greater acreageunder cereals, chiefly barley. Crops grew well in the first part of 1960, but the prolonged rains from early July made conditions very difficult both for harvestingand for subsequent operations. Although quality in general suffered,production of most crops has again increased. Output of milk, beef and poultry meat has also been increasing but there have been fewer pigs and eggs. Moreconcentrated feedingstuffs have been used but, with the larger supplies ofhome-grown cereals, imports of feed are expected to be lower.Changes in Income4. Despite the exceptionally wet weather from harvest time onwards, theindustry&apos;s income is being maintained. The forecast of actual net income for1960/61 is  359 million compared with the revised estimate for last year of 356 million. When adjusted for normal weather conditions, the forecast for1960/61 is  373 million. This is the highest figure so far and compares with the revised estimate for last year of  355 million. The difficult conditions of thepast autumn and winter may affect actual income in the coming year and,although it is accepted that the risks of weather must normally be carried by the farmer, the circumstances have been so wholly exceptional that the Governmenthave taken this consideration into account in assessing the prospects of theindustry.Costs and Efficiency5. There has been a considerable net increase in the cost of goods and services used in agriculture, due principally to increases in wages and rents.The net increase for Review commodities is about  19 million, compared with 13 million last year. On the other hand, the efficiency of the industry continuesto increase, and this has been taken into account on the lines set out in theReport on the 1960 talks between the Agricultural Departments and the Farmers&apos;Unions. *Cost of Agricultural Support6. The cost to the Exchequer of support for the industry has increased.In 1959/60 it was  257 million. In 1960/61 it is expected to be  266 million.Details of the expenditure in 1959/60 and 1960/61 are given in Appendix V,* The Report was published as a White Paper (Cmnd. 1249) in December, 1960.
II.   Determination of Guarantees7. The Government have decided that the total value of the guarantees *should be increased by  14 million. The determinations for the particular commodities are set out in Appendix VI. They relate to crops of the 1961harvest and to livestock and livestock products for the year April, 1961 to march, 1962. The main features are as follows.Fat Cattle8. Although the number of animals slaughtered in 1960/61 shows a small increase on the previous year, the number of calves retained for beef production has recently been falling. With consumption per head still well below pre-war, demand for beef is likely to remain strong. A further stimulus to beef production is needed, both on its own merits and to encourage those producerswho can do so to switch from milk to beef. The Government have therefore decided to increase the guaranteed price of fat cattle by 10s. Od. per live cwt.As beef production is a long-term proposition, farmers need to be able to planahead with confidence. It is the Government&apos;s hope and intention that, unless there is a significant change in circumstances, the new guaranteed price shouldnot be reduced at the 1962 Annual Review.Milk9. There is a &quot; standard quantity&quot; for milk, which is at present around 2,000million gallons a year, for which the Milk Marketing Boards receive the guaran-teed price, now about 3s. l^d. per gallon. Total sales off farms are now running at over 2,300 million gallons, of which less than 1,600 million gallons go forliquid consumption. The balance can only be sold by the Boards at manu-facturing prices, now averaging about Is. 6d. per gallon. But the Boards poolthe money they receive from all sources and pay a pool price, now about2s. lOd. per gallon, to individual farmers. Any increase in production beyond what can be sold for liquid consumption means more milk for manufacture and therefore a reduced pool price. Milk production has for some time nowbeen increasing at a faster rate than has the consumption of liquid milk, and asa direct consequence of this the pool price paid to farmers has been falling.In the year 1960/61 it was about lfd. lower than it was in 1959/60.10. While recognising that this has caused difficulties for dairy farmers,particularly those with small farms, the Government consider that it would only aggravate the problem to increase the guaranteed price without at the sametime devising means to prevent such an increase stimulating still further pro-duction. The need is to devise some modification of the pooling arrangements under the milk marketing schemes, which have the effect of obscuring fromproducers the consequences of producing more than can be sold profitably.In other words, the principles implicit in the national standard quantity for milkmust be applied to the payments to individual producers. One way would beto provide that each individual producer was paid under two tariffs. Thefirst, applying to a basic allocation, would reflect the return on the nationalstandard quantity; the second, on the balance of his output, would be basedon the price received by the Boards for manufacturing milk.* The total value of the guarantees is the sum of (i) the value of the price guarantees(calculated for each commodity by multiplying the guaranteed price by the quantity of outputqualifying for the guarantee) and (ii) the value of the relevant production grants. For 1960/61the figure is about  1,279 million.
11. Up to now the general view of the Unions has been against such asystem, but the Government have now put the issue to them as one whichbears directly on what the Government feel able to do about the guaranteed price.   The Unions agree that the whole question must be reconsidered.12. The Unions have therefore agreed that immediately after this Reviewthey, with the help of the Milk Marketing Boards and the Agricultural Depart-ments, will examine all possible means of resolving this admittedly complexproblem with the intention that a workable and satisfactory system, fulfillingthe stated objective, should be devised not later than 31 st July. This new system should bring home to individual producers that output beyond a certain levelwas not in their interest unless it could be produced profitably at the manufac-turing price. The Unions would throw their full weight into recommending the acceptance of such a system and its introduction as soon as practicable.13. The Government welcome the constructive approach of the Unions and,in advance of a satisfactory system being devised and introduced, they haveagreed to an increase of 0 - 8d. per gallon in the guaranteed price. This increase would not have been given at this Review except on this understanding and theGovernment are bound to give a clear warning that, if a suitable system cannot be devised and introduced, they will have to reconsider at the next Review theincrease now given. They would then see no prospect in the long term otherthan a continued reduction in the pool price with all that means to theprofitability of milk production.14. As agreed at the 1960 Annual Review the standard quantities for thevarious milk marketing areas will be increased to reflect the increases in sales forliquid consumption in 1960. These increases amount in total to 21-6 million gallons, equivalent to an increase in the guaranteed price of 0-2d. per gallon.Fat Sheep and Wool15. Output of mutton and lamb in 1960/61 is maintaining the level of 1959/60and supplies are being spread more evenly over the year. Present indications are that production next year will remain stable. The Government have decided tomake no change in the guaranteed prices of fat sheep and wool.Fat Pigs16. There was a gradual recovery in the breeding herd up to September, 1960,but recent progress has been disappointing and it is unlikely that an adequatelevel of output will be restored without some further stimulus. The Governmenthave decided to increase the guaranteed price by 3d. per score. At the sametime the Government have been anxious to devise a scheme which would ridthe industry of recurrent pig cycles. They have therefore decided to introduce the flexible guarantee arrangement described in paragraph 24. To give pigproducers greater confidence in the future, the Government have undertakennot to reduce the new basic guaranteed price at the 1962 Annual Review.Eggs17. The slightly lower output of eggs in 1960/61 has been more thancompensated by the accompanying improvement in producers&apos; returns perdozen; the better balance between supply and demand, which the Governmenthave for long wished to see, has materially improved the industry&apos;s position. Thisyear&apos;s good returns have led producers to order more chicks from hatcheries
over the last six months as compared with a year ago, and the prospect is thatthere will be a moderate increase in the output of eggs in 1961/62. provided this is kept within bounds and the upward trend of consumption is maintained,both market prices and returns to producers should remain satisfactory, thoughprobably at a rather lower level than the unexpectedly high prices of the current year. The Government^ conclusion is that the guaranteed price should be leftunchanged.Cereals18. Over the last five years there has been a progressive and substantial increase in the production of barley, while that of oats and mixed corn has declined considerably. Production of wheat has, relatively, shown little change.The objectives are to bring about a better balance between the guaranteed pricesof the main cereals; to contain the Exchequer payment, particularly on barley,within reasonable limits; and to improve the marketing of barley so as to avoidoverloading the market in the period following the harvest. The production of barley has risen from 2\ million tons in 1954/55 to 4J million tons in 1960/61.The rate of subsidy on barley is at present nearly half the market price, which is out of all proportion to the support for any other commodity. The Governmenthave therefore decided to reduce the guaranteed price by Is. 2d. per cwt. the guaranteed price of wheat will be left unchanged. The guaranteed price of oatswill be increased by 3d. per cwt. Arrangements designed to improve the marketing of barley are referred to in paragraph 26.Potatoes19. There has been a big crop again in 1960 and producers&apos; returns have beenlow for the second year running. The Government have decided to increase the guaranteed price by 5s. Od. per ton. Something like the present acreage isrequired to meet demand at reasonable prices in years of average yields.Paragraph 27 refers to proposed arrangements for supporting the market in years of heavy surplus.Sugar Beet20. The maximum acreage grown must be related to the capacity of the sugar beet factories. The present guaranteed price is adequate to ensure thisacreage and the Government have decided not to change it.Production Grants21. The cost of the fertiliser subsidy is estimated at over  32 million thisyear. Since the last Annual Review there has been a further fall in fertiliserprices. It has been decided to reduce the rates of subsidy from 1st July next.At the present level of consumption this change is estimated to reduce the totalfertiliser subsidy by about  2  million.22. No changes are being made in other production grants.III.   New Guarantee and Marketing Arrangements23. In addition to the new system envisaged for milk the government propose to make the following changes in the guarantee arrangements and in marketing.
Fat Pigs24. The purpose of the new flexible guarantee for pigs is to limit thefluctuations which have bedevilled this branch of farming for so long. the guaranteed price will be adjusted automatically at quarterly intervals by reference to a forecast of certifications in a 12-month period, i.e. the numberof pigs likely to receive the guarantee payment in that period. Adjustmentswill be made in accordance with the following scale: Adjustment to the forecast level of certifications basic guaranteed priceLess than 9 - 75 million9-75 million or more but less than 10 million10 million or more but less than 10-3 million10-3 million or more but less than 10-8 million10-8 million or more but less than 11 million11 million or more but less than 11 - 25 million11 - 25 million or moreAn increase of Is. 6d.An increase of Is. Od.An increase of 6d.Basic guaranteed price.A reduction of 6d.A reduction of Is. Od.A reduction of Is. 6d.As the present forecast of the level of certifications for 1961/62 is somewhat less than 10-3 million, the immediate effect of the new arrangement will be toraise the guaranteed price by 6d. per score on 27th March, 1961. This increase is of course additional to the increase of 3d. per score in the basic guaranteed price mentioned in paragraph 16.25. Quality premiums will continue to be payable on eligible pigs underthe same conditions as in 1960/61. The separate stabilising arrangements willalso be continued, with the slight modifications mentioned in Appendix VI.The Government realise, however, that the guarantee arrangements for fat pigsare still unsatisfactory in several respects. They propose to examine these arrangements in consultation with the industry with the object of improvingthem as soon as possible.Barley26. As agreed in the Report on the 1960 talks the Government have been discussing barley marketing with the Unions and the trade organisations con-cerned. The marketing problem is to prevent excessive offerings of barleyimmediately after harvest. For the 1961 crop, it is proposed to introducenew arrangements to provide growers with an incentive to hold barley till later in the season. This incentive will be financed from within the total sumpayable to growers under the guarantee for barley. The new arrangements,the details of which will be decided after further discussion, are outlined inAppendix VI.Potatoes27. The Government have discussed with representatives of the producersmeans of strengthening the market for potatoes in years of heavy surplus and low prices by the establishment of a Market Support Fund, to which both theGovernment and the Potato Marketing Board would contribute. The estab-lishment of such a Fund by the Board will depend on certain amendments tothe Potato Marketing Scheme which the Board will be referring to registered producers. If it is not possible to complete arrangements for the establishmentof a Market Support Fund in time for the 1961 crop, arrangements similar tothose which applied to the 1959 and 1960 crops will be introduced if necessary.Separate arrangements will be made to deal with the special position in NorthernIreland.
Market Research and Development28. In the Report on the 1960 talks the Government welcomed the increasingemphasis given by the Unions to marketing. The industry acknowledge thatit is for them to take the lead in securing a better market for their products.They accept the need to carry out market research, to adopt standards ofgrading and to tackle the problem of seeing that the customer gets the food heprefers and food of uniform quality. The Government want to encouragedevelopments of this kind and proposed to the Unions that, as part of the review settlement, some funds should be provided to support marketing ratherthan production. Their proposal was that, for an experimental period of threeyears, the Government should make grants up to a total of  500,000 a year formarket research and development. They suggested that the grants shouldbe on a percentage basis and that roughly one half of the cost of approvedprojects should be borne by the industry itself from its own funds. The unions have noted the Governments proposal with considerable interest and have indicated that after the Review they will be willing to enter into discussions inorder to consider the proposal and its implications in more detail. The Govern-ment hope that it will be possible to introduce the grants as a feature of the 1962Annual Review.Machinery Syndicates29. The Government also want to encourage suitable forms of co-operationamong farmers and are glad to see the progress made in the organisation of farmers&apos; syndicates for the co-operative use of agricultural machinery. TheGovernment therefore intend to make a one-third capital grant towards expendi-ture incurred in future by landowners or farmers when they provide buildingsto house machinery and grain drying and storage equipment for use by machinerysyndicates.IV.  Effect of Determinations30. In reaching their conclusions at this Review the Government have hadwell in mind the requirements of the national economy, including the interestsof trade relations with the Commonwealth and other food supplying countries.They consider that the determinations now made fulfil their obligations underthe Agriculture Acts and accord with the objectives of production and guaranteepolicy set out in the Report on the 1960 talks.31. The net income of the industry depends on many factors other than thelevel of the price guarantees and production grants. But the government consider that the present determinations, which increase the value of the guarantees by  14 million, will, together with the new guarantee and marketing arrangements, enable the industry to face the coming year with confidence.

(not yet available)Note (f). The estimates of aggregate farming net income in Tables A and B arearrived at after making provision for depreciation. Net income can be defined asthe reward for the manual and managerial labour of the farmer and his wife, andfor the use of the occupier&apos;s investment.Note iii). These two series of aggregate farming net income are calculated in fundamentally different ways. The &quot; Departmental&quot; estimate is built up from the statistics of income and expenditure for the whole &quot; national&quot; farm, whereas the&quot; raised sample &quot; is based on some 3,600 actual farm accounts, which are expanded or &quot; raised &quot; to give an aggregate for all farms in the United Kingdom. There are anumber of reasons why the levels of aggregate net income shown in these two series should vary but it is difficult to make a quantitative assessment of the individual causes.Both series are of value in indicating the general trend in the level of income.
Note (iii). The figures for aggregate net income in Table A include as profit inrecent years about  9 million on the production of food for consumption in the farmhousehold.

Od.Notes on Price Tables(a) The guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep and wheat are average pricessubject to variation seasonally; the guarantee payments for fat cattle and some fatpigs are subject to variation according to quality; and the method of calculatingfatstock guarantee payments involves an element of estimation. Because the market-ings of fatstock and wheat cannot be accurately forecast, producers&apos; average returnsunder the guarantees for those products in any year may be a little more or less thanthe guaranteed prices.(p) The guaranteed price for pigs for 1960/61 in Northern Ireland was subject toa reduction of Id. per score to take account of certain expenditure incurred on pigprogeny testing stations in that country. This reduction ceased from 13th February,1961.(c) The guaranteed price for pigs for 1961/62 is subject to the flexible guaranteearrangement described in paragraph 24 (page 9).(rf) The prices guaranteed to the British Egg Marketing Board for hen and duckeggs are subject to profit and loss sharing arrangements in accordance with the termsof a financial agreement between the Government and the Board. They include an allowance for the Board&apos;s administrative costs in operating the guarantee arrangements and marketing expenses (including packers&apos; margins, packaging costs, transport and,in the case of hen eggs, certain trading losses).Part II,   Additional Details of GuaranteesFatstock1. The guaranteed prices for fat cattle, fat sheep and lambs and fat pigs for 1961/62are on the basis of a deficiency payments scheme similar to that in operation for1960/61, except as stated in the following paragraphs.2. Fat Cattle. The differential of 5s. Od. per live cwt. between the rates of guaranteepayment for Grade I and Grade II cattle will be applied by increasing the average rate of guarantee payment for home-bred cattle by Is. lid. for Grade I and reducingit by 3s. id. for Grade II. The resultant rates of payment will be rounded to the nearest6d. If in respect of any week the average rate of guarantee payment is 3s. Id. percwt.or less there will be no guarantee payment on Grade II animals and appropriate rates,to be announced separately, will be paid only on Grade I.
3. Fat Sheep. As in previous years there will be no upper limit to the weight atwhich live sheep or their carcases may be certified, but any guarantee payment will,as determined after the 1960 Annual Review, be restricted to the following weights: Dressed Carcase Weight*27th March, 1961       On and afterto 28th May, 1961      29th May, 1961Lambs   ..      ..        551b. 551b.Hoggets ..      ..        701b. 651b.Other clean sheep       70 lb. 65 lb.* In the case of sales by liveweight estimated d.c.w.In the case of sales by deadweight actual d.c.w.4. Fat Pigs. The guaranteed price for fat pigs in 1961/62 will be related to anannual level of certifications for the guarantee of 10-3 million or more but less than10-8 million. It will be adjusted when necessary to take account of changes inquarterly forecasts of the annual level of certifications in accordance with the scalegiven in paragraph 24 (page 9).5. As in previous years, the guaranteed price for fat pigs in 1961/62 will also besubject to adjustment in accordance with the operation of a feedingstuffs formula.For this purpose the guaranteed price for 1961/62 is related to a standard feed priceof 24s. 7d. per cwt.6. The stabilising limits will be 2s. Od. below and 2s. 6d. above the guaranteed price (as adjusted in accordance with the flexible guarantee arrangement and thefeedingstuffs formula) instead of 2s. 3d. on either side of it as at present.Eggs7. The guarantees for hen and duck eggs in 1961/62 will be on the same basis as in 1960/61.8. As in previous years, the guaranteed prices for eggs in 1961/62 will be subjectto adjustment in accordance with the operation of a feedingstuffs formula. For thispurpose the guaranteed prices for 1961/62 are related to a standard feed price of23s. 5d. per cwt.Wool9. The guaranteed price for 1961/62 is an average price per lb. to be received bythe British Wool Marketing Board for wool (other than skin wool) produced in theUnited Kingdom and tendered to the Board during the twelve months commencing1st May, 1961. As in previous years the guarantee will be implemented in accordancewith the provisions of the financial agreement concluded in November, 1955, betweenthe Government and the Board.Milk10. The guarantee for 1961/62 will be on the same basis as in 1960/61, exceptthat the standard quantities for each area in 1961/62 will be as follows: million gallonsNew StandardIncrease QuantityEngland and Wales........      19-4 1,698-2Main Scottish Area   ..Aberdeen and DistrictNorth of ScotlandNorthern ireland  -9 184-80-1 19-70-1 9-31-1 97-1Cereals11. The guaranteed prices for cereals for 1961/62 will be on the basis of a deficiency round scheme similar to that in operation for 1960/61, except as stated in thefollowing paragraph.
12. Barley. The total of guarantee payments on barley of the 1961 crop will bedetermined, as for earlier crops, by multiplying the price deficiency per cwt. by an agreed estimate of yield of merchantable grain per acre and by the qualifying acreage.But, in order to encourage a better seasonal spread of marketings by growers, thedistribution of this total fund will be adjusted so that the average rate of acreage pay-ment made to growers who deliver barley, after sale, in the later months of the cerealyear will be greater than the rate received by growers who deliver barley, after sale,in the earlier part of the cereal year. This seasonal scale of payments, and the deliveryperiods to which they will apply, have still to be determined by Ministers, afterconsultation with representatives of growers and users of barley. The scheme will be designed with the object of ensuring, so far as possible, that the rate of acreage paymentmade to growers who retain all their barley for use on their own farms will not beaffected by the new arrangements.Potatoes13. The guarantee for 1961/62 will be on the basis of a deficiency payments schemesimilar to that in operation for 1960/61, except that the Government have agreedthat sales of potatoes for human consumption by unregistered growers to licensedmerchants in Great Britain will be included in the estimate of the tonnage of home-produced potatoes (other than new potatoes) to which the guarantee applies.Sugar Beet14. The guarantee arrangements for sugar beet for 1961/62 will be on a similar basis to those in operation in 1960/61, except that the contribution by the british sugar Corporation to the cost of transporting beet to factories in England and wales will be for agreement between the Corporation and growers&apos; representatives, inaccordance with Section 17(3) of the Sugar Act, 1956.S2325)  Wt. 1134/338  K.110  3/61   Hw.
