SECRET nnn230     document IS THE PROPERTY   OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTGj^jlil COPY NO. ^ ^27th March. 1961CABINETWHITE PAPER ON THE NATIONALISED industries memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer*I have reflected on the points made in the Cabinet discussion on21st March (C. C. (6l) 15th Conclusions, Minute 4) and would like to placesome thoughts before my colleagues in advance of the resumed discussion.]2.      There is, I think, a broad measure of agreement on the general lines of policy proposed in the draft White Paper.     These fit in well withthe declaration in our Election Manifesto  &quot;We shall do everything possible]to ensure improved commercial standards   of operation and lesscentralisation in those industries already nationalised&quot;.3.      I attach the highest importance to this new initiative.   Let merepeat what I say in my memorandum on public expenditure - C. (6l) 43,paragraph 28:-&quot;If we can give the nationalised industries effective financial objectives, and keep them to it, and make them carry out their investment and manage their labour force and conduct their business generally with a concentration on paying their way -on the lines developed by the Nationalised Industries committee this can make a difference to the Exchequer of many scores of  millions a year, and much more to their contribution to thegrowth of the Gross National Product. &quot;To carry this out successfully could well be the biggest single factor in getting our public expenditure right in the next few years.4.      It has been suggested that effect might be given to the new initiative without the publicity of a White Paper.      I doubt whether it is practicable to conceal an effective policy and, indeed, concealment mightwell make it ineffective.   The considerations which lead me to this conclusion are these:-(i) the- ubJic has come to expect that goods and services providedby nationalised industries should be recognisably &quot;cheap&quot;:   there is not sufficient realisation that there is no escape from paying the full costs of these industries and that, if they are not borne by the consumer, theywill fall on the taxpayer.   It is doubtful too whether there is a properappreciation of the load of these industries and their development on thepublic purse.   A new climate of public opinion is needed and a policypronouncement by the Government is an essential element in creating this.(ii) The nationalised bodies have public (i. e. statutory) financialduties laid upon them.   Under the proposed policy these are being more precisely interpreted.   It would make for confusion all round if ostensiblythe existing position is continuing whereas, in fact, a new interpretationis in force - especially as the new interpretation may well require the-1-5ECRET
bodies to act differently in the future.   Failure to publish now would makethe bodies (especially those who have welcomed the proposed publicclarification) sceptical about our intentions:,  and lessen the value ofthe new initiative as a means of increasing financial discipline inside the bodies themselves.(iii)     The Parliamentary aspect is very important.   There is continuingpressure in Parliament about the problems of the nationalised industries.It would hardly be right or wise to withhold from Parliament that therehad been a fresh interpretation- of financial and economic obligations whichare embodied in Acts of Parliament.     The Select Committee, which isquick to detect and criticise Ministerial intervention in the industries wouldquickly elicit this:   and I believe that in the end disclosure would be forced upon us in a way which would do more damage than publication now.(iv)   We need to bear in mind, too, the embarrassments to us of a withdrawal from publication at this stage.   The proposed paper has had a wide circulation among nationalised bodies:   and the existence of it isknown to a wider circle including some of our own supporters.   The documencontains a reply (which we shall have to make in the near future anyway)to the Select Committee&apos;s remarks on Ministerial intervention in theindustries and their proposals that subsidies should be given to compensate for this.5.     A reprint incorporating various amendments made in the lightof the Cabinet discussion is attached.   It may be useful if I say now how the reprint deals with two points of substance raised in the Cabinet dis-cussion.Paragraphs 23 and 24 - the 8 per centI see considerable advantages in a reference to &quot;somewherearound 8 per cent&quot; in the Paper.   A return of this order has been obtained in the Post Office, British European Airways and, indeed, some electricity boards and, unless it receives some endorsement, it will   be increasingly difficult for them to maintain that standard of performance.   I recognise,however, the risks of prejudice to the effectiveness of the White Paperif the inclusion of paragraphs 23 and 24, as previously drafted, were to provoke public disputation with any of the Boards.   I would, therefore,,regretfully agree to the omission of the reference in paragraphs 23 and 24provided a reference were inserted at the end of paragraph 10 to the factthat one or two of the undertakings are already earning about 8 per cent.Paragraphs 10 and 23 (incorporating the former paragraph 24) of thereprint show these changes.   My acquiescence does not mean that I would agree that the 8 per cent level of performance is an inappropriate target for certain undertakings.Old Paragraph 32 )  ^ pThe omission of the words:  &quot;It would be open to them to require a written statement of the Ministers&apos; views, which could be publishedif the Boards so desire&quot; has been suggested.   Some at any rate of the   ^Boards would object to more precise and public obligations being placed upon them unless they had the assurance that, when the Government felt obliged to prevent them from making price increases, this intervention-2-
should be publicly acknowledged, if it had a significant effect on theBoards1 finances and the boards so wished.   The Government would stillbe able to intervene in the direction of urging greater financial res -ponsibility (e. g. to resist vage increases) without any public disclosure.Thus, the only kind of Ministerial intervention which would have tc be disclosed would be where the Government had asked the Boards to refrain from price iircreases to an extent which would significantly impair the boards&apos; ability to fulfil the agreed objectives.   Experience has shown thatsuch interventions are rare and are not necessarily unpopular.   We should thus appear as protectors of the public against the Boards.Old Paragraph 33  ) . Costs^ew -^paragraph 32 )In the reprint the last sentence of paragraph 33 of the original draft has been omitted and the remainder redrafted to minimise the risksthat this passage might have been used by the Boards as a means of avoiding!strict compliance with the proposed financial discipline.   Cn the otherhand, I do not think it would be right to withdraw from the Boards theprotection, contained in the previous draft, that in fixing the targetsinitially regard would be had to the extent of their commerciallyunprofitable activities;  and that adjustments would be made if significantadditional burdens were later imposed.6.      I understand that the President of the Board of Trade, while infavour of the policies in the draft paper, is against their publication inthe form of a White Paper.   He thinks this would give rise to political difficulties and perhaps exaggerated expectations among some of our supporters.   It would not, he thinks, be necessary to conceal the new initiative:   the document or at any rate its main contents could be dis-closed to and through the Select Committee.   This approach may under-sstimate the extent to which the White Paper envisages a change indirection and also the potential size of the advantages of the new policy to the economy and the Exchequer.   It is an important subject on whichthere are expectations of a Government pronouncement, and it may seemodd to Parliament, to some of our supporters and to the Boards if itemerges indirectly.   I fear too that this might impair the effectiveness of the new initiative.   I should, on balance, prefer publication in the formof a White Paper as proposed by the Committee on Nationalised Industries.   IS. X,.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.27th March, 19613-
The Financial and EconomicObligations of the nationalised IndustriesPresented to Parliament by the Chancellor of the exchequer by Command of Her majesty march 1961Cmnd.london her MAJESTY&apos;S STATIONERY office net

THE FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC obligations of THE NATIONALISED INDUSTRIESMore than ten years have elapsed since the passing of the statutes whichbrought a number of industries into public ownership. During that period there has been much general discussion of the operation of these industries.There have been enquiries by the Herbert Committee into the electricity supply industry in England and Wales and by the Fleck Committee into the organi-sation of the National Coal Board. The Government and the British transport commission have received advice on the structure, finance and working of the organisations controlled by the Commission. The Select Committee on nationalised Industries has produced reports on four industries (the North ofScotland Hydro-Electric Board, the National Coal Board, the Air corporations and British Railways), which have done much to increase public knowledge.Until now there has, however, been no general review of the manner in whichthe general principles and, in particular, the economic and financial principles which were established in the nationalising statutes have been applied in practice.Much experience has been gained both by the Government and by the industries themselves during this period, in addition to the evidence provided by public discussion and by these special reports. In the light of this knowledge and experience the Government have considered how these principles might for thefuture most appropriately be applied to the existing nationalised bodies and tothe Post Office with its new status.*2. In the course of this review the Government have consulted the boatds of nationalised industries about the statutory obligations as they stand and theirapplicability for the future. The review has been conducted against the background of the Government^ general policy in relation to nationalised industries. The relevant aspects of this are as follows. First, the task ofgovernment is to ensure that the industries are organised and administeredefficiently and economically to carry out their responsibilities, and that theyare thus enabled to make the maximum contribution towards the economicwell-being of the community as a whole. Second, although the industries haveobligations of a national and non-commercial kind, they are not, and ought not, to be regarded as social services absolved from economic and commercialjustification.3. This review has not been undertaken in any spirit of criticism of the performance of nationalised industries whose role in meeting the needs of thecommunity for power, transport and communications is vital. The per-formance of the industries is affected by many matters which were dealt within the Nationalising Acts their organisation and structure, their relationswith the Government and Parliament, their relations with the workers and withconsumers, and their obligations to the community.   These are all of great* This paper accordingly discusses principles applicable to the National Coal Board, theElectricity Boards, the nationalised transport undertakings, the Gas Boards, the Air Cor-porations and the Post Office.331080 A 2
and continuing importance, but the Government believe that particular con-sideration should be given to the industries&apos; economic and financial basis:because, unless this is sound and practical, their performance and morale are bound to be impaired. The Government consider that the time has now cometo clarify the financial responsibilities of the nationalised industries in order toestablish a firmer foundation for their future operations.The Existing Framework4. The industries, which were subject to the nationalisation measures in theyears 1946 to 1950 had very different histories and differed considerably (as they still do) in their prospects. Their economic strength also differed and they hadto carry varying burdens of non-commercial, and generally unprofitable,obligations. Their economic and financial rights and obligations, as prescribed by the nationalising statutes, followed a fairly standard pattern. This was based on the view that they were neither straightforward commercial concernsnor social services, but a combination of both: and perhaps on the hope thatthe ability to borrow at Government rates would enable them to meet the limited financial obligations prescribed by statute and also to carry out their non-commercial obligations. For a variety of reasons (many of which havebeen outside the control of the undertakings themselves) their financial per-formance has generally fallen short of these hopes.&quot; Paying their way &quot;5. The undertakings have, in common parlance, been expected to pay their way and most of the nationalising statutes contain a requirement to this effect.Their statutory obligations prescribe that their revenues should, on an averageof good and bad years (or some similar phrase) be not less than sufficient to meet all items properly chargeable to revenue, including, interest depreciation theredemption of capital and the provision of reserves. Thus the Acts prescribea minimum performance and not a maximum. Moreover, this performanceis defined in terms of a surplus or deficit, which differs from the ordinarydefinition of profit or loss inasmuch as provision is required to be made fromrevenue for all the items mentioned above before a surplus in the statutorysense arises. The undertakings were thus expected to make some profits in theordinary sense, of that term in order to accumulate reserves from them.6. It was envisaged that in some years the nationalised undertakings mighthave a surplus and in other years a deficit. This provision was inevitable, forfluctuations in general business conditions were bound to affect their financial results, and there is no equity capital to act as a buffer. But if deficits are inevitable in some years surpluses must be accumulated in good years; and theperiod over which an average of surpluses and deficits is struck must not be unduly prolonged.7. The wording of the Acts implies that the industries should provide out ofrevenue not only for payment of interest on capital but also both for depreci-ation and the redemption of capital. If these requirements were stringentlyinterpreted they would impose upon the industries the responsibility not merely of providing from revenue for the maintenance of their capital assets buteventually of ridding themselves of capital liabilities. In practice, with theagreement of successive Governments, the industries, like their predecessors,have not been required (nor have they sought) to make provision on this scale.
8. Their practice has varied according to their economic strength, theirtraditions and the precise nature of their individual statutory obligations. Ingeneral they calculate the provision for depreciation in their accounts on the historic cost of their assets. Most of the Boards recognise in their reports that,following the practice generally adopted by industrial concerns, it would be prudent to make some additional provision out of revenue to meet the difference,which emerges when prices rise, between depreciation at historic cost and atreplacement cost and as a reserve against obsolescence.9. The Acts also provide for the building up of general reserves and giveMinisters power to issue directions as to the amounts. Although some of the undertakings show general reserves in their balance sheets these are in somecases entirely obliterated by accumulated deficits on revenue account. Thetotal retained income of all these industries taken together (including supple-mentary depreciation provisions, capital redemption funds and reserves) hasnot been sufficient to provide for the replacement of assets used up in theproduction process, and this is also the case in most of the individual industries concerned.Financial Performance10. Tables I to III at the end of this paper summarise the financial results achieved in recent years. The balances on revenue account and reserves aregiven in Table I. The results are expressed as gross and net yields on average net assets in Tables II and III. The results vary markedly from industry to industry. This is to be expected. Some of the industries are expanding rapidlywhereas others are contracting: some are exposed to keen competition whereasothers have monopolistic elements in them: moreover the weight of non-commercial obligations varies from industry to industry. For all these reasonsthese financial results cannot by themselves be regarded as indicators of theefficiency of the individual industries. Although the return on capital employedin one or two of these undertakings has been around 8 per cent, per annum netafter depreciation at historic cost most of them have over the years earnedconsiderably less than 5 per cent.11. Table IV shows the extent to which public corporations depend on the savings of others to finance their investment. In 1959 these corporationsinvested, in round figures,  810 millions, compared with about  480 millions in1954. In the same period their own savings went up only slightly from  190millions to  240 millions and their dependence on savings by the rest of thecommunity thus increased from  290 millions to  570 millions. The pictureis complicated by the special position of the British Transport Commission.But even leaving aside the Commission, the increase in the savings of the othercorporations from 1954 to 1959 ( 110 millions) was only about half the increasein their investment ( 214 millions).The return on public capital12. Comparisons are sometimes drawn between the return on capital in private enterprise and the return in public enterprises. It is suggested that overthe past five or six years the rate of return on capital in private enterprise wasaround 15 per cent.: and this view is supported by the series of figures quoted in Table III.13. The Government believe, however, that simple comparisons of this kind which tend to overlook or understress the differences between these nationalised
undertakings and private enterprise would be misleading. While it is legiti-mate to look for the same rate of return in a publicly owned enterprise which is fully commercial in its nature and is engaged in the same type of business as private enterprise, the main nationalised industries are not in this position.14. Many of the industries are, or are akin to, public utilities, where a lowerreturn on capital employed is traditional, partly because of the absence of riskin the business and partly because the earnings of such utilities are normallysubject to public regulation owing to the advantages of monopoly which theyare believed to enjoy. Although the area of nationalised industry in whichthese conditions exist is continuously shrinking as competition develops, thetradition of low yields and the restraints which go with it are still an important element in the situation. Moreover, the fact of nationalisation has tended to arouse public expectation that the products and services of these industries should be provided cheaply, and the Boards have been continuously subject to pressure from public opinion to keep their own prices down even when costs and prices elsewhere have been rising. In this way they have contributedsubstantially to efforts to stabilise prices and their own financial position, asreflected in the return on their capital, has suffered in consequence. The lower rate of financial return must also be attributed to the onerous national and non-commercial obligations which the Boards are expected to carry. the boards, moreover, are for a variety of reasons unable to adjust the expendituresof their industries as rapidly as other industries can when there is a change in economic conditions: and this is of special importance in relation to those industries which are contracting.15. These considerations readily account for the low return on the capital of the nationalised industries in relation to that on industrial and commercialcapital generally. It would, however, be unwise to ignore the risks of damage tothe nationalised industries themselves and to the economy generally that are inherent in the present situation. If the profitability of capital development is assessed on different (and easier) financial criteria from those adopted in industry generally, there is a risk that too much of the nation&apos;s savings will be divertedinto the nationalised industries. Again, if the prices of the goods and services which the nationalised industries provide are uneconomically low, demand forthem (and for investment to produce more of them) may be artificially stimu-lated.16. Thus the operation of the nationalised industries with an unduly low rate of return on capital is sooner or later damaging to the economy as a whole.It must result either in higher taxation or in greater borrowing by the exchequer in order to provide for the replacement of their assets and for new development.The figures in Table IV show the scale on which these industries are drawing onthe rest of the economy. For the reasons already indicated, the nationalised industries generally have had to rely more heavily upon the Exchequer than ishealthy, either for themselves or for the economy as a whole. It is important,therefore, that a careful watch should be kept on the financial and other obli-gations of the Boards so as to ensure that a reasonable balance is maintained between them: such balance can readily be disturbed either by the growth ofnon-commercial activities or by a reduced capacity on the part of the industryto bear them.
A New Financial Framework17. In the Government^ view there would be no advantage in altering the basic financial and economic principles which the nationalised undertakings are by their statutes required to observe. If, however, these principles are toprovide a satisfactory basis for their operation in the public interest they need to be interpreted more precisely in the form of financial objectives for the nationalised undertakings generally.18. The main heads under which clarification or re-statement of the obli-gations and relationships envisaged in the nationalising Acts is needed are asfollows:Revenue Account.Capital Account.Prices and Costs.Revenue Account19. The Government consider that the financial objectives of the nationalised undertakings under their Statutes should now in general be interpreted on thefollowing lines: (a) Surpluses on Revenue Account should be at least sufficient to coverdeficits on Revenue Account over a 5-year period: in arriving at thesurpluses and deficits for each year there should be charged againstrevenue the items normally so chargeable (including interest, and depreciation on the historic cost basis).(b) Provision should also be made from revenue for: (i) such an amount as may be necessary to cover the excess of depreciation calculated on replacement cost basis over de-preciation calculated on historic cost as in (a) above.f(ii) adequate allocations to general reserves which will be availableinter alia as a contribution towards their capital development and as a safeguard against premature obsolescence and similarcontingencies.20. It is the Government^ view that in general anything more than a five-year period as the balancing period for the formula in paragraph 19 would be too longfor effectiveness. They propose, in consultation with each board which hasfinancial autonomy under the Acts, to agree a framework on the above linesfor the next five years as an experimental period, but the operation will be sub-ject to review each year in the light of events inside and outside the industry.This procedure will be applied in all the major nationalised industries,* in-cluding the Post Office.21. The wide differences in the economic conditions of the various national-ised undertakings have been emphasised earlier in this paper. Their earningpower, total depreciation provision, and reserve requirements will vary accordingto their prospective commercial, technological and financial development.t The undertakings would not be required specifically to make good now any under-provision (i.e. on account of the difference between the historic cost basis and the replacement cost basis), which has already occurred in years prior to the operation of these new arrange-ments.* Separate proposals have been made (Cmnd. 1248 of December, 1960) for some of the nationalised transport undertakings, including the railways.
The criteria in paragraph 19 would be consistent with the general run of theexisting statutory obligations, but they cannot be expressed as one standardformula to be applied to all nationalised undertakings alike.22. Experience has shown, however, a general need for nationalised industries even those which were at one time reckoned to be relatively free from commercial risk to build up adequate reserves to deal with contingencieswhich may affect their capital as well as their revenue accounts. Moreover,there are powerful grounds in the national interest for requiring these under-takings to make a substantial contribution towards the cost of their capital development out of their own earnings, and so reduce their claims upon thenation&apos;s savings and the burden on the Exchequer: this is particularly so for those undertakings which are expanding fast and which have relatively large capital needs. In normal circumstances, the desirable level of reserves shouldbe related to the amount of capital employed in the business.23. It follows from all these considerations that the State, as owner orguarantor of the capital of the nationalised industries (which are investing over 800 millions a year more than half of which comes from the Exchequer),would expect capital employed in this kind of business to earn a higher rate of return than the cost of the money to the Exchequer. The objective for eachundertaking will be determined in the light of its own circumstances, needs and capabilities in relation to the criteria in paragraph 19. For some, the objectivesmay be expressed in terms of progress towards an appropriate level of self-financing of their capital expenditure, concurrently with the provision of suitablecontributions to reserve. For others, the objective may be in terms of a specified rate of return on capital employed.Capital Account24. The existing procedures for discussion and authorisation of matters concerning investment and borrowing will be continued and can be codifiedas follows: (i) The Government will each year discuss with the undertaking andapprove the general lines of its plans for development and capitalexpenditure for the next five years ahead and be ready to agree to long-term commitments as appropriate.(ii) In the light of (i) the Government will each year fix an upper limit on the amounts to be spent on investment by the undertaking duringthe two years ahead.(iii) The Government will approve proposed borrowings on the basis ofan annual reasoned estimate submitted by the undertaking.(iv) The Government will require to be kept informed of the extent towhich the undertaking is proposing to invest new capital in projects which are expected to yield a relatively low return.25. These requirements flow from the Governments responsibility to keeppublic sector investment generally within the nation&apos;s resources, as well as fromthe Governments role as provider of public capital It would be the Govern-menfs task to satisfy themselves that the procedure within each organisation for scrutinising and approving capital expenditure was effective.26. The existing arrangements under which capital expenditure in excess of the approved ceiling, or borrowing in excess of the estimates, are subject to investigation and discussion between the undertakings and the Departments
would continue. These procedures fit in with the recent arrangements underwhich Parliament has been given more detailed information about the estimates of investment and borrowing from the Exchequer and the Government^undertaking to inform Parliament of the reasons for any marked variationbetween the estimate and the out-turn.27. While the proposed arrangements are adapted to the present system,under which the industries resort to the Exchequer for their long-term capital requirements, the proposed clarification of financial obligations and theimprovement in financial performance would be necessary and desirable in any event. The reasons which caused the Government to discontinue in 1956 theprocedure of borrowing from the market, with the support of a government guarantee, and to withdraw the financing of the transport, gas and electricity industries from the market into the Exchequer are still valid. While theGovernment recognise the force of the arguments in favour of requiring national-ised bodies to raise money from the market on their own credit, they see nopossibilities of an early move in this direction. They accept the view of theCommittee under the chairmanship of Lord Radcliffe on the Working of the monetary System (Cmnd. 827, paragraph 595) that such unguaranteed borrow-ing is not a realistic alternative, at least for the present. The amounts of moneyneeded are much too large to be raised in the open market without government support and the industries are, of necessity, closely associated in the public mind with the Government, so that it would be difficult for the market to regard them as independent financial concerns. Whatever may be the possibilities forthe future, an improvement in the financial record as contemplated under thepresent proposals would be a prerequisite.28. The procedures in paragraphs 20 to 26 would be applicable as long as thefinancial performance and prospects of the undertaking were satisfactory interms of the new financial framework. In other cases the Government would be bound to take a closer interest. Thus inability or prospective inability tomeet the requirements in paragraph 19 (a) would be regarded as falling so far short of the objectives that the undertaking would be required to proposespecific measures for righting the situation: it would naturally consult theMinister about these and the Minister would expect to be satisfied on various issues, including the financial justification for major investment proposals.Even if the undertaking were fulfilling the requirement in paragraph 19 (a),inability to achieve the objective set for it under paragraph 23, would beregarded as inadequate performance. In this case, the undertaking would be under an obligation to inform the Minister of the general plans for preventing the situation from deteriorating further and for making up the leeway.Prices and Costs29. A clear definition of each Board&apos;s financial obligations inevitably raisesthe question of the extent to which the Boards should have freedom in theirpricing policies. Although the Government possess no formal power to fix prices in the nationalised industries, nationalised undertakings have, in fixing their prices, given great weight to considerations of the national interestbrought to their attention.30. Increased prices would not be the only way in which nationalised under-takings could carry out the prescribed financial obligations.   For a variety of
reasons, such as fructification of investment and reduction of unprofitableactivities, combined with continuing improvements in commercial efficiency,some of the industries will be capable of increased productivity, part of whichshould be available to improve their financial results. The aim of the industriesgenerally will naturally be to secure the necessary additions to their net revenueas far as possible by reductions in costs. The Government recognise, however,that the industries must have freedom to make upward price adjustmentsespecially where their prices are artificially low.31. While recognising the case for greater freedom and flexibility in thepricing policies of nationalised industries the Government must interest them-selves in the prices of these goods and services which are basic to the life of thecommunity and some of which contain a monopolistic element. In additionto the formal arrangements for the representation of consumers&apos; views throughConsultative Councils in the various industries and for the regulation of fares and charges in certain cases, the existing informal arrangements are thatthe Chairmen of the Boards ascertain in advance the views of the appropriateMinisters when they prepare to make substantial changes in the level of their prices. In the Governments view these arrangements should continue.If a Board decided to modify their own proposals by reason of views expressed by the Minister it would be open to them to require a written statement of those views, which could be published if the Board so desired,and to propose an appropriate adjustment of their financial objectives where,in their opinion, this modification would significantly impair their ability tomeet them.32. Financial performance is affected not only by the level of prices but bythe level of costs. Costs may in turn be significantly affected by the amountof commercially unprofitable activities carried on by individual undertakings.These activities will, so far as practicable, have been taken into account in fixing the financial standard for each undertaking. To the extent that com-mercially unprofitable activities are subsequently imposed from outside, aBoard would be entitled to ask for an adjustment of its financial objectives.Conclusion33. The nationalised industries are from their size and nature bound to play a major role in the economic life of the country. They cannot, however, beregarded only as very large commercial concerns which may be judged mainly on their commercial results: all have, although in varying degrees, widerobligations than commercial concerns in the private sector. The object ofthese proposals is to find for each industry or Board a reasonable balance between these two concepts. The Government believe that the closer definitionnow proposed for the financial and economic obligations of the industries should help improve their performance and morale. It should also reduce theoccasion and need for outside intervention in the affairs of the industries and enable them to make the maximum contribution towards their own development and the well-being of the community as a whole.

TheThe figures are also taken from this source except that those for the public corporationsare given here in more detail. Subsequent revisions incoporated in the economic survey 1961 have not been taken into account.(2) Gross saving before providing for depreciation and for tax, dividend and interestreserves.(3) This is equal to the surplus on revenue account less taxes on capital plus transfers to capital account.(4) This is equal to net investment abroad less capital transfers from abroad, stock appreci-atton and the residual error.
Notes on Tables I to III Table  IThe figures of accumulations at the beginning and end of the period 1954 to1959 include both balances, whether surplus or deficit, on revenue account atthe appropriate date and such of the reserves of the body concerned as werenot allocated to specific contingencies such as liabilities for future taxation orinsurance.Tables 11 and IIIDefinitionsGross income covers trading profits or trading surplus and other incomebefore deduction of depreciation, provisions for capital redemption, tax,interest and dividends.Net income is equal to gross income minus depreciation. A minus figureindicates a net loss before taking into account interest payable.Net assets cover total assets (excluding discounts on stock issues and, inthe case of the British Transport Commission, the Special Account for revenue deficits) less liabilities of a current nature. The figure used isthe average for the beginning and end of the year.Depreciation covers depreciation as charged in the accounts but excludessupplementary provision. In the case of the British Transport Corn-mission, however, it includes an additional amount based on capitalexpenditure charged to revenue. Depreciation is charged at historiccost except in the case of a few companies in the private sector whichcharge it at replacement cost. For the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board depreciation is reckoned as equivalent to the instalmentspaid to local authorities plus contributions to the redemption fund.SourcesManufacturing and distribution: data for the 3,000 companies quoted onthe United Kingdom Stock Exchange have been published by theNational Institute of Economic and Social Research for 1953 and, onthe same basis, by the Board of Trade for the years 1954 to 1958. Thefigures for 1959 have been estimated by the Central Statistical Office onthe bais of material appearing in the &quot; Economist &quot;.Iron and steel: data assembled for 55 companies in this industry by theIron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency. As a result ofdenationalisation the number of these companies in the private sectorincreases each year while the number remaining in the public sectordiminishes.All other authorities: the annual accounts of the relevant authority.periods for manufacturing and distribution and for iron and steel, 1954 coversaccounts in respect of accounting years ending within the fiscal year1954-55 and similarly for later years. For the Gas Council and Boards,Electricity (B.E.A./C.E.A./E.C.) and Boards and the two airways corporations the figures for 1954 relate to fiscal year ending March, 1955.For the remainder, accounts relate to calendar years. In the case of theSouth of Scotland Electricity Board which came into being on 1st April,1955, the figures for 1955 are shown on an annual basis.
InterpretationParagraphs 13 and 14 of the text indicate some of the qualificationsapplicable to Tables II, III and IV. In addition, in comparing thefigures for the various undertakings inside the nationalised sector andwith industries in the private sector, there are a number of factors to betaken into account including the following: (1) valuation of assets cannot be obtained on a uniform basis. the valuation of fixed assets, investments and stocks, etc., oftendepends on the date (and the price level) at which they werebought and also on factors such as depreciation and revaluationpolicies, writing down investments and writing off bad debtsaccording to the attitude to and interpretation of the principlesof conservative finance by individual managements;(2) there is a wide divergence in the nature of the undertakings, in thenature of their assets, including the length of the fructificationperiod for investment, and in the conditions under which theyoperate; for example most factories benefit from the derating actswhile electricity power stations and gas works do not;(3) accounting practices vary but the consequences of this have so faras possible been eliminated; the adjustments made have not beenfound to affect the results significantly.(31080) wt*15SO, 10,20, 110 book   3/61  D.l.
