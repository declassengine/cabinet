C.P.E. (Report) copy No.   89COMMITTEE ON CONTROL OF PUBLIC EXPENDITURESECOND INTERIM REPORTJo the Right Hon. D. Heathcoat Amory, M.P.,Chancellor of the exchequer the SYSTEM OF DECISION-MAKING IN GOVERNMENTEXPENDITURE1. The first and central problem to which the Committee has applied itself isto bring the growth of public expenditure under greater control and to contain it within such limits as the Government may think desirable.2. The level of Government expenditure is ultimately a consequence of basicGovernment policies. The crucial point is the system by which policies affectingpublic expenditure are made and by which decisions about public expenditure are taken. This includes the responsibilities both of Ministers and of officials, and the procedures by which matters are prepared for Ministers, and then decided: it includes the impact of Parliament and public opinion on these decisions.3. The basis of the present system is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer isin sole charge, subject of course to the collective assent of the Cabinet, of the publicpurse. Departmental Ministers ask the Chancellor individually for the money they need. If the answer is &quot; No &quot;, they may contest that answer in Cabinet. When thishappens other departmental Ministers are unlikely normally to regard themselves asmuch concerned, for their concern with public expenditure is with their own needs and not with those of other Ministers.4. Thus expenditure commitments are usually decided piecemeal. In thenormal course of business Ministers collectively do not see and discuss eitherpublic expenditure and its prospective growth as a whole, or its major components;nor do they see this developing expenditure against prospective resources.5. Chancellors of the Exchequer from time to time draw their colleagues&apos;attention to the growing aggregate; but &quot; economy campaigns &quot; improvised in hasterarely achieve anything of lasting value and the system is such that it is difficultto take effective action in due time. There is neither a regular review process by ministers collectively nor any procedure by which expenditure decisions can betaken by Ministers in the light of (a) what the country can afford having regardto prospective resources and (b) the relative importance of one kind of expenditureagainst another.6. It follows that from the point of view of Ministers outside the Treasury therecan hardly be said to be any collective responsibility for the management and direction of public expenditure. The system encourages the departmental Ministerto think only as a &quot; spender &quot; and to disregard the long-term financial implications of his policy on Government expenditure and the national economy as a whole;indeed the system hardly permits him to be aware of them. It leaves the Chancellorof the Exchequer to wrestle with the resulting aggregates as best he can.7. In expressing its views in these terms the Committee is in no sensecriticising Ministers, the Treasury or Departments. This is the system as itdeveloped in the 19th century, the instrument by which an austere discipline was maintained throughout the public service for generation after generation inmarked distinction to other countries&apos; experience. It is a system that served thecountry well.8. But in its heyday, the essential feature of the system was that parliament and public opinion were opposed to public spending; the external pressures onthe Government were to reduce both expenditure and taxes, and a Minister wantingto spend had to fight hard to carry his colleagues with him. The Chancellor, andthe Treasury behind him, had powerful supporters in Parliament and outside. ThisCONFIDENTIAL57143-2 B
11 Oattitude was reinforced at local level in relation to expenditure from rates. In theinterwar period, public attitudes v/ere changing; but this essential feature, thoughless pronounced, still remained.9. The social, political and economic changes since World War II havereversed all this. First, the scale of public sector expenditure is far greater. supply is now 22 per cent, of the gross national product, compared with 12 per cent, in^1930, 6 per cent, in 1910, and 4 per cent, in 1870. In addition there has been theexpansion of local authorities&apos; spending and the bringing of the energy and transport industries into public ownership, so that the public sector of the economy as awhole now includes about one-quarter of the total labour force. Second, public expenditure has become far more complex, including, as it does, the cost of the mostadvanced technological projects and scientific research; the financing ofcommercial risks which the private sector cannot take; aid to under-developed countries; social insurance schemes of unprecedented complication. In all of these,decisions involve commitments, contractual or moral, extending many years ahead!Third, there has taken place a great change in economic thought the Keynesianrevolution in the role of public finance and its relationship to the national economy as a whole.10. These, and above all the fact that the main weight of parliamentary and public pressures, central and local, is for innovations or improvements whichcannot be brought about without great increases in public expenditure, have created a situation in which, in the Committee&apos;s opinion, the traditional system of decision-making can no longer be expected to be effective in curbing expenditure.If, as must reasonably be expected, these changes are permanent, the system needs to be reconstructed accordingly. The Committee sees no escape from this.11.   The Committee is agreed upon the main lines of the reconstruction whichit would suggest. This involves three basic principles:  I. Effective collective responsibility of Ministers for public expenditure, sothat the Chancellor of the Exchequer no longer carries the weight alone.II. Regular Ministerial appraisals of public expenditure as a whole, over aperiod of years ahead, and in relation to prospective resources.Decisions involving substantial future expenditure should be taken inthe light of these appraisals.III. -The greatest practicable stability of decisions on public expenditure whentaken, so that considerations of long-term economy and efficiencythroughout the public sector have the best possible opportunity todevelop.I. A Public Expenditure Committee12. In setting out the first of these principles, the Committee does not contemplate any modification in the sole individual responsibility of theChancellor of the Exchequer, within the Cabinet, for fiscal and economic policy.The changes listed above and in particular the changing concept of the role of theBudget in relation to the national economy make this unity of responsibility moreindispensable than ever. Any proposal for a formal snaring of this part ofthe Chancellor&apos;s authority and responsibility would create more problems than itsolved.13.   This responsibility is, however, the individual responsibility of theMinister in charge of this sector of policy.  It need not and does not conflict with ,what we recommend, which is that the Cabinet should address itself far more than hitherto to the totality of expenditure, to its major elements, to priorities and to itsmeasurement against resources, both currently and over a period of years ahead.In suggesting this we do not contemplate that the Cabinet would in any degree&quot; take-over &quot; the responsibilities of the Chancellor of the Exchequer-any morethan it takes over from the Foreign Secretary the determination and conduct of-foreign policy by reason of the constant discussion of that policy which nonnallwtakes place in Cabinet.  But it would give the Chancellor support, and it wouldmake the theory of collective responsibility, as something allied and complementary to individual responsibility, a reality in this field of Government affairs as it has long been in many others.
14. It might be helpful in achieving these objectives if there were set up a small group of senior Ministers, under the Chairmanship of the Chancellor of theExchequer, as a Public Expenditure Committee of the Cabinet. The chancellor would bring before this Committee the various appraisals of expenditure and resources which we mention in Section II of this Report (below). It would also serve as a Ministerial body to consider particular proposals coming forward from timeto time involving substantial expenditure.15. The setting up of the Committee might well lead in time to theestablishment of a rule or convention that no Minister should submit proposals tothe Cabinet involving substantial future expenditure until the Public expenditure committee had considered them.16. In any event we envisage that the Committee would be consultative ratherthan executive in character, and would not seek to take the Chancellors decisionsfor him. Its work should not be regarded as a substitute for Cabinet discussion; itwould normally be a preliminary to and a preparation for it. In particular it wouldbe most important that it did not become an alternative (and easier) means by whicha spending Minister could seek to contest an important difference between himself and the Chancellor on his expenditure proposals. Such a challenge should continueto be made to the Cabinet.17. It is not for us to suggest what the composition of a Cabinet committee might be. But what is in our mind in making this recommendation is that it mightbe found that this piece of machinery would work best if it consisted of a fairly small number of senior Ministers, some of whom were not responsible for Departmentsspending large sums but others of whom might be substantial &quot; spending&quot;Ministers.18. If this Committee were established or even without it, if the Cabinetaddressed itself increasingly to expenditure questions and to the appraisals ofexpenditure and resources mentioned in Section II below it would also be desirableto constitute an appropriate Committee of Permanent Secretaries to supervise thepreparation of the appraisals and to create a wider appreciation at official level ofthe considerations involved.II. Long-term Appraisals of Expenditure and Resources19. The development and use by Government of long-term appraisals ofexpenditure and resources is our central technical recommendation in this Report,and it must be appreciated that there are serious practical considerations involved.If an attempt is made to base policy on appraisals of this kind, before the conceptsinvolved in them are thoroughly digested both by the Treasury and by theDepartments and before methods of using them have been well developed, their usemay do more harm than good. In this field, a bad appraisal can be worse thannothing.20. However, the Treasury has been actively developing this kind of work inthe last two or three years, and the Committee has formed the impression that thepoint has been reached at which it should now be possible to go ahead, provided ofcourse that practical considerations are kept fully in mind, and the machine is not pressed faster than it will go.21. On the side of expenditure forecasting, this is the third year in which theDefence Departments (and the Ministry of Aviation, and for the first time the atomic Energy authority) have been preparing &quot; forward looks &quot; covering a periodof five years ahead. This is a very important operation for the management of thedefence effort itself, to get a proper balance and to establish a sound basis for planning. It has not yet been possible to use the &quot; forward looks &quot; in the way inwhich we believe they can best be used; there has so far been too muchconcentration of attention upon the first year and not enough on the course of laterdevelopment. But this should come; and the Committee&apos;s report on defence expenditure will place great weight on this.22. On the civil side, useful expenditure appraisals must cover the wholepublic sector, including local authorities and nationalised industries,&quot; below-the-line &quot;expenditure as well as expenditure on Votes. We believe that this can be done. a forecast of educational expenditure was recently made for the consideration of theCrowther Report; a similar forecast has been prepared for the National Health57143-2
Service; for some years there have been regular forecasts of public sectorinvestment. These large areas of civil expenditure, together with defence and overseas expenditure, make up about 85 per cent, of the total public expenditureon goods and services.23. A large part of Government expenditure on grants and subsidies and benefits, such as that on agriculture and national assistance, is more difficult to forecast in this v/ay, for here the Government is not acting within its own discretion as it does when it uses resources itself by employing men and placing orders, but ispaying out money according to what is happening to the recipients&apos; other earnings(which introduces an additional element of uncertainty).24. On the income or resources side also it is impossible to make closepredictions five years ahead. But it should be possible to form judgments ofconsiderable practical validity as to whether a prospective rate of growth of public sector expenditure on goods and services is likely to outrun the prospective growth of resources, with the inevitable consequence of higher taxes, an overloadedeconomy, and so on. It must be emphasised that the purpose is to form a broadjudgment about the implications of expenditure policy, not to draw up ahypothetical balance-sheet of the whole economy five years ahead, and it seems reasonable to think that such judgments can be made. With increasing experienceit should be possible to place considerable reliance upon these judgments.III. Stability of Expenditure Policy25. The third of the three principles mentioned in paragraph 11 above is basedon the experience that chopping and changing in Government policy is frustratingto efficiency and economy in the running of the public services, and impairs the cost-consciousness and financial discipline at all levels which it is difficult to engenderand maintain in the public service and which are of fundamental importance. Theexperience of recent years, both in the Treasury and in the Departments, and in the wide circles of local government and nationalised industry outside them, is that&quot; economy campaigns &quot; and &quot; stop-and-go &quot; are damaging to the real purpose ofcontrol of public expenditure.26. It must be accepted, of course, that some changes in government expenditure policy are inevitable. The Government has to seek to manage thenational economy within fine tolerances. If unemployment falls below, say, \\ percent., strong inflationary tendencies are likely to develop; if it rises above, say,2\ per cent., there is pressure for urgent action to provide employment. To work within tolerances of this kind, the Government needs all the weapons it can get.27. By far the most effective course for the Government in such circumstancesis to seek to affect private consumption rather than the public sector. Indeed,experience shows that attempts, at moments of inflationary pressure, to imposeshort-term &quot; cuts &quot; or &quot; economies &quot; in Government current expenditure (or tomake increases at moments when &quot; reflation &quot; is called for) are positively damaging.There are certain parts of Government expenditure (e.g., maintenance) which can at any rate in theory be manipulated in this way, but the Committee&apos;s view is thatin general the attempt so to act in this current expenditure field, in either direction,should be avoided.28. In public sector investment there is a tendency to overestimate thepossibilities of useful short-term action, and to underestimate the indirect losses of &quot; stop-and-go &quot;. Experience shows that at least six to nine months (and very oftenmuch more) must elapse before measures take full effect. In the two-year period from high to low, which characterises post-war fluctuations, there is a tendency for the measures to bite at the very moment when the economy should be going into reverse, the &quot; cuts &quot; of autumn 1957 taking effect in the summer of 1958,requiring a &quot; reflation &quot; of public investment which took effect in the summer of 1959. The Full Employment White Paper of 1944 was written in terms of thepre-war cycle of seven years: with a considerably shorter cycle the remedies maybe worse than the disease.29.   However, there clearly are some possibilities of short-term variation in public sector investment.  It might be possible to list, a series of &quot; fast-movingelements which could be singled out for use in this way; and to allow some marginsin the big programmes, e.g., those of the nationalised industries, which could becalled into play or cut off according to national need.
30. We recommend that these possibilities should be examined, by discussionwith the various public authorities concerned. It is only by specifying in advance the fields to which short-term action can and will be directed, and explaining itfully to those in charge of the specified programme, that the variations can bemade without damaging the wider objectives of control and economy of public expenditure.Conclusion31. The Committee would recommend that progress should be made as fast as possible in the directions indicated by the three &quot; principles &quot;, I, II and III,in paragraph 11 above. The Committee will be considering and reporting further on these and other aspects of the matter. Indeed the general considerations whichwe have set out in this Report and which have led us to make our presentrecommendations are colouring all our work.32. The logical extension of these arrangements, which will enable ministers collectively to look at public expenditure as a whole over a period ahead and against prospective resources, would be to give the public and Parliament thesame sort of presentation of the situation year by year. The difficulties and dangersin taking this step are obvious, and even if it were contemplated it would benecessary in our view to proceed cautiously and only after experience of theworking of the arrangements proposed for Ministers. It will also be necessaryto examine the Form of Estimates and Accounts to make sure that they will fitproperly into this framework of administration. And, above all, it will be necessaryto develop the relationships between the Treasury and the Departments consistently with these wider concepts of collective responsibility for public expenditure.On behalf of the Committee,PLOWDEN,Chairman.3rd June, I960.S
