&amp;EZ?EE^0&apos;&quot;&apos; 74isDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 18, COPY NO.W      20th February, 1961CABINETSUBSCRIPTION TELEVISIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome department at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 31st January I was invited todiscuss further with Sir Harry Pilkington the proposed experiment insubscription television (C.C.(6l) 3rd Conclusions, Minute 6).2. This I have done.    My colleagues will remember that on23rd November, I960, Sir Harry wrote to the Postmaster General thatthe issues raised by this proposal, both in itself and in its impact on other questions of broadcasting policy, were so important that, if theywere prejudged,   &quot;the Committee must ask itself whether its work would serve any useful purpose&quot; (Annex A to C. (60) 191).    Sir Harry has made it perfectly clear to me that he and his Committee hold this view no less strongly than they did three months ago - indeed, rather the reverse.The proposed experiment would mean establishing a third body, financed by a method different from that either of the British broadcasting corporation or of the Independent Television Authority.    This is amatter on which the Pilkington Committee definitely wish to make recommendations and their Chairman is emphatic in saying that theyshould be allowed to do so.    It is a view which found considerable support in the Cabinet in their earlier discussions.3. Apart from the possibility of damaging reactions from the pilkington Committee, the experiment would be bound to involve us inunwelcome controversy.    It would require licence from the PostmasterGeneral, on which - to judge from all past experience - it would be practically impossible to avoid a debate in Parliament.    In presentconditions, we could not hope to avoid much acrimony.4. I recognise the strength of the arguments about developing our export markets, but my own view is that we ought not to allowsubscription television, by way of experiment or otherwise, before wehave received and considered the report of the Pilkington Committee.R. A. B.Home Office, S. W. 1.20th February, 1961.
