Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1961Copy No.     32CABINETNATIONAL THEATREMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the past history of this matter and the relevant considerations to-day were summarised in my memorandum C. (60) 162. When the Cabinet considered this at the end of last year I undertook to review the whole question in the light both ofthe representations which i was then expecting to receive from the Joint council for the National Theatre, and of the views expressed by the Cabinet, and tosubmit further recommendations to my colleagues in due course (C.C. (60) 58thConclusions, Minute 7, and 61st Conclusions, Minute 6).Joint CounciPs Views2. The Joint Councils deputation, which i met on 9th December, was led bySir Kenneth Clark, and included Lord Chandos, and representatives of the OldVic Theatre, the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon and thecommercial theatre. They restated the case for a National Theatre, and explainedtheir plans in some detail. They argued that a new theatre building on the South Bank site was an essential part of the scheme, and that it must have two auditoria one an amphitheatre and the other with a proscenium stage. The Old Vic andStratford companies would be fully integrated to form the nucleus of a singlecompany of 150 actors which could maintain a repertory of 15 or 20 playson the South Bank, at Stratford and on tour. They argued that the salaries atpresent paid at the Old Vic and Stratford compelled leading actors to &quot; subsidise &quot;both institutions, and would have to be substantially increased in a national theatre.3. Not surprisingly the estimates of cost provided by the deputation wereformidable. They amounted to  2-3 millions ( 138,000 a year at 6 per cent.) forthe building and  470,000 for annual subsidy, making a total of  608,000 a year.For purposes of comparison the tentative figures quoted in paragraphs 10-12 ofC. (60) 162 were  2 millions ( 120,000 a year) for the building and  250,000 forannual subsidy, making a total of  370,000 a year. It is fair to add, however, thatthe deputation emphasised that they had deliberately pitched their estimates onthe high side in order to run no risk of misrepresenting the prospects. Theypressed above all for an early decision so that, if it were negative, the Old Vicand Stratford could each press on with their individual plans.Arts CounciPs Views4. I subsequently sought the Arts CounciFs comments on the Joint CounciFsproposals. They have reiterated strongly the need in their view for a national theatre, including a new theatre building, and endorsed in broad terms the Joint  CounciPs proposals subject to further detailed scrutiny, particularly of the theatre^ building plans. They also expressed the view that the figure for the annual subsidyrequired could reasonably be reduced from  470,000 to  300,000 a year. keeping the same figure of  2-3 millions ( 138,000 a year at 6 per cent.) for the cost ofbuilding, this would mean a total annual cost of  438,000.0C.

Provincial Needs5. Whatever decision the Government take about a National Theatre, it isclear that there is a strong case for some increase in the financial support givento drama in the provinces through the Arts Council. It is also clear that, the more the Government decide to do for drama in London, whether by agreeing to financea National Theatre or by other means, the greater will be the demand for increasedsupport for provincial drama. The Arts Council already have plans for spendingup to  50,000 a year on contributing to the cost of renovating provincial repertorytheatres, and I am expecting to receive from them at an early date a request for authority to carry out a recommendation of their Committee on &quot; Housing the arts &quot; that up to an additional  100,000 a year should be spent on contributing to the cost of building new theatres in the provinces, which the Committee rightlyconsider to be primarily the responsibility of local authorities. The arts council have also advised me that, if the Government were to approve theNational Theatre project, they could expect to be asked to provide through theCouncil a minimum of  40,000 a year more towards the running expenses of provincial repertory theatres.Possible Courses6. There appears to me to be a choice before the Government, broadly,between three possible courses. The first of these (Course A) would be to decline to finance the Joint CounciTs plans for a National Theatre, and take no other special measures to increase the Government^ financial support of the drama. Even ifwe adopt this course, I doubt whether we should avoid some increased subventionof provincial drama on the lines referred to in the first part of paragraph 5 above,together probably with some gradual increase over the years in the subsidy at presentpaid to the Old Vic ( 50,000) and the introduction of an increasing subsidy for Stratford. Generally, however, the line would be: &quot; Business as usual &quot;.7. The second choice (Course B) would be for the Government to inform theJoint Council that they are in principle prepared to finance a National Theatrebroadly on the lines of the Joint CounciPs scheme, but subject to its further detailedscrutiny, and to scaling down of the estimates of cost on the fines recommended bythe Arts Council.8. The third possible course (Course C) which I invite my. colleagues toconsider would be based on the theory that the Company the human element ofthe plan should be developed successfully before an expensive new building is decided upon. This course would be presented, on lines such as these. TheGovernment would say that they had decided that the increased measure of financial support which they wish to give to the living theatre would be best devoted, not toa costly National Theatre project involving the building of a theatre with twoauditoria on the South Bank but to giving greater support, through the Arts Council,to two existing theatres with a great dramatic tradition namely, the Old Vic andthe Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. This increased support would take the form both of capital grants for improving the existing buildings particularly the Old Vic building in York Road and of increased annual subventionto enable actors&apos; remuneration to be improved and rather more touring to beundertaken. An approach to the problem on these positive lines would, I am advised,also involve a measure of additional support for the provincial repertory theatres onthe lines referred to in paragraph 5.9. In order that my colleagues may be able to form some impression of therelative financial implications of the three alternative Courses discussed above Ihave had them tabulated, so far as possible, in the accompanying Annex.10. The figures given in the three tables in the Annex call for two comments.The first is a general one. The estimates given of expenditure under Course A relatenot only to the present but to the foreseeable future apart from the effect of rising costs. In the case of the figures given under Course B, the full estimated figure of 300,000 a year required for the running costs of a National Theatre would not be ^reached for about four years after the initiation of the project (the cost would buildup to this figure by annual stages), but thereafter the amount of annual subsidyrequired could, and in my view very probably would, increase further. In the caseof the estimated costs under Course C, the figure of  193,000 for annual subventions
to the Old Vic and Stratford (including touring by both) would be the figure likelyto be required soon, and this figure might well have increased as much as 50 per cent,or  100,000 by the time when a National Theatre might be in full operationif Course B were adopted. Again, the cost of supporting improved standards at theOld Vic and Stratford must, like the cost of a National Theatre, be expected toI continue to. increase further thereafter, although no estimate of such further increased cost can be given in either case at this stage.11. My second comment on the figures in the Annex is a particular onerelating to the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre. No provision has been made under either Course B or Course C for capital expenditure on the theatre at Stratford-upon-Avon although under either Course if not under Course A as well a case may atsome time be established for improving the auditorium there, possibly byreconstructing it on amphitheatre lines. No reliable forecast can be given now either of when such improvements might be justified or of how much they might cost.12. Despite its financial attractions for me as Chancellor of the Exchequer Ido not consider that Course A is really a practicable one. We can hardly claim yet to have redeemed our Election pledge to do more to support the living theatre, andit seems to me important against this background that we should be able to point to some positive alternative to the National Theatre project if we should decideagainst it. The adoption of Course C would clearly enable us to do this.13.  The other advantages of Course C would, in my view, be:(a) a capital saving of at least  2 millions until such time as some new buildingmight be required (whether to replace the Old Vic or not);(b) a more controllable increase in annual subsidy to drama because theGovernment would not be deeply and directly committed to a costly new national enterprise;(c) less stimulus to other artistic interests to press their competing claims for more money (for example, Scottish ideas of a theatre-cum-opera house for Edinburgh);(d) preservation of distinct Old Vic and Stratford traditions, and avoidance of over-centralisation of national drama;(e) we should be seeking to build better &quot; national&quot; companies within two existing institutions. If that were to develop successfully, we couldconsider anew a National Theatre plan, whether by amalgamation ofthe two or otherwise.14.   On the other hand, the disadvantages of Course C would be:(/) we should be spending substantially more Government money than atpresent on the drama without being able to claim that we had established a National Theatre as hitherto conceived;(g) we should have missed an opportunity which may not recur to establishsuch a National Theatre with the co-operation of all major interests concerned;(h) the South Bank site might cease to be available for the eventual building,if not of a National Theatre as hitherto conceived, at least of a newOld Vic, which, even under Course C, would be likely to be required indue course.I do not myself think that there is much force in either (/) or (g) above. I have beenled to believe that the &quot; united front &quot; of theatre interests behind the present joint council is little more than a facade, and might well not long survive a decision bythe Government in principle to proceed with the Joint CounciPs scheme. I also consider that there is considerable scope for presenting Course C as our alternativeand more pragmatically English way of establishing a National Theatre ascompared with what The Economist recently described as &quot; a pompous mausoleumfor the bright young critics to peck at every week-end &quot;. At the same time, ifbourse C were to be adopted, I should consider it very desirable that the South Bank site should not be developed for other purposes but should remain availablefor the possible building of a new theatre in the future. It would, therefore, be my intention to see the leaders of both sides on the London County Council and try to secure their co-operation in ensuring this before any announcement was made.58552
15. In conclusion, I should make it clear that the Arts Council, who act in an advisory capacity towards me in this matter and with whom I have continued tokeep in close touch, remain unwavering in their support for the National Theatreproject and would regard Course C, although feasible, as definitely a &quot; secondbest The CounciPs Chairman has, however, been most co-operative in helpingme to assess the implications of the alternative Courses open, and has.assured me of the Council&apos;s full support in carrying out whatever Course the Government may -decide to adopt.S.
