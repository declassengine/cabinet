SECRET *   ,this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   February 1961C. (61) 22 Copy No.14th February, 1961 /CABINETFACILITIES FOR THE GERMAN forces memorandum by the Minister of defence on 7th February the Cabinet invited me to ascertain what would be entailedin granting the military facilities requested by the German Government,particularly the training facilities for armoured regiments (C.C. (61) 5thConclusions, Minute 5).2. The Federal German Government have submitted a detailed request forthe following facilities in the United Kingdom:(a) Storage of ammunition, petrol, oil and lubricants (POL), and generalsupplies for both the Army and Navy.(b) Maintenance facilities for Naval aircraft and vessels of British origin.(c) Facilities for shore target firing from Naval vessels and facilities foramphibious training and for exercises with Naval aircraft.(d) Range facilities for one armoured regiment at a time covering a periodof about 30 weeks in the year.They have not at this stage made any firm request for further assistance for theGerman Air Force.3. We have made arrangements to meet the Germans in Paris on 22nd and23rd February, for discussions between experts under the auspices of the north atlantic Alliance. These will be exploratory discussions, and Governments willnot be committed by them. I propose that the instructions to our representatives should be on the following lines:(a) The requirement for the storage of naval and military ammunition andgeneral stores can probably be met by making available a completedepot at Broughton Moor in north-west England (which would otherwise be closed down, with a resulting unemployment problem).If this is not acceptable for any reason, other arrangements can probably be made.(b) The requirement for storage of Naval POL could probably be met by building additional capacity at German expense in existing royal naval depots at Rosyth and Invergordon on the east coast of Scotland.If this is not acceptable, we will examine the possibility of terminating the leases of storage capacity in these depots at present held by civilianfirms. The requirement for the storage of Army POL could perhaps bemet by building additional storage at German expense in certainMinistry of Power depots.(c) It is possible that Naval or civilian repair establishments can undertake the repair of German naval aircraft and vessels in peacetime but moredetails of the commitment are required before any final answer canbe given.(d) Some Naval training facilities in the Cape Wrath area can be madeavailable to the German Navy in the summer of 1961.(e) Facilities for a maximum of 9 weeks in 1961 can be made available at theCastlemartin range in South Wales. In later years we might be ableto provide at this range three-quarters of the capacity the Germans have asked for.58504
4. The Cabinet have already agreed that no difficulty should arise over thefirst three items in paragraph 2. As regards the tank training, there is no questionof manoeuvres over wide areas of country. It is a question of our making availablepart of the capacity of an existing training area for simple tactical exercises andfor firing of guns. The facilities at the range of the North Atlantic Alliance atHohne in Germany, which is used by our own and several other Alliance forces,are superior; but it is already fully occupied, which is why the Alliance have askedusi&apos; to see if we can help by providing some capacity for the Germans at one ofour ranges.5. The Secretary of State for War and I have naturally considered whether we should offer to release space at the Alliance range and use the Welsh range forthe British Army of the Rhine. However, this would involve heavy expenditure ontravelling and several million pounds on buying an extra set of tanks and on putting up buildings; it would be inconvenient for the units; and their training would suffer.The fact is that it is inherently inefficient to bring formed tank units from Germanyto Wales for training. If it is a choice between our accepting these drawbacks andthe Germans doing so, I would rather they did. Conceivably we may find thattheir problem is not one of exercising formed and trained units but of training newunits in process of formation. More probably we shall find that they do not wishto pursue the proposal at all when they realise the drawbacks. However, we donot want it to seem, if the proposal is dropped, that it is because we have inventeddifficulties to avoid having Germans here. Apart from anything else, that mightprompt the Alliance to transfer capacity at Hohne from us to the Germans.6. The German Minister of Defence and the German Ambassador here haveassured me that their Government are anxious to avoid anything that will causepolitical difficulty here. It is important, however, not to do more than we needby way of rubbing in to the Germans that our people dislike them. The foreign secretary has recently asked me to do everything possible, in defence matters, tosee that the Germans do not feel they are regarded as second-grade allies,particularly at this juncture in international affairs. Moreover, the difficulties wehave in interesting the Germans in our armaments will not be lessened if Germanofficials see us approach a matter like the present in a way that is humiliating tothem. This will he a point to bear in mind in the handling of these requestsgenerally.7. I shall need to make a statement on progress in these matters in the debate on defence in the House of Commons, the most likely date for which is28th February.8. Later on probably about May it may be necessary to lay before bothHouses of Parliament the drafts of Orders in Council under the Visiting forces act, to legalise the Germans&apos; exercising military discipline over their forces in thiscountry, and also to put them in the same position as our own forces in relationto, for example, the law about firearm licences. I am in touch with the HomeSecretary and other Ministers concerned about this.9.   I invite the Cabinet to take note of how this is proceeding.H. W.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1,13th February, 1961.
