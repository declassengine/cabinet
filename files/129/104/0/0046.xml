DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S government.(61) 46.....* i an abMMM24th March, 1961orPY NO.  1CABINET&quot;BRITAIN&quot; OR &quot;U.IC &quot;for Common wealth relations have long felt that we make the task of public relations with commonwealth countries more difficult by referring to ourselves as&quot;the United Kingdom&quot; or &quot;the U.K. &quot;.     This soulless, official design a-tion is totally lacking in popular appeal and inspires no emotions ofaffection or loyalty.2.   In the years before the war, when it was still permissible to talk of the &quot;British Empire&quot; or the &quot;British Common wealth&quot;, it wasrightly felt that other member countries might resent it, if wearrogated to ourselves the term &quot;British&quot;, which was common to the mall.   But since then the whole character of the Common-wealth has changed.   The new members, such as I&quot;dia,  Ceylon and Ghana, havenever regarded themselves as British.   Iv-eamvhile the Canadians,Australians and New Zealanders, although  a.s proud as ever of theirBritish  ancestry and of their links with the &quot;old country&quot;, have nowdeveloped individual nationalities of their own.   Thus there is no longer any good reason why we shotvld continue to handicap ourselves  withthe present unsympathetic nomenclature.3.    I propose therefore that, in our relations with commonwealth countries, we should revert to the hc^t^lI terms &quot;Britain.&quot; and &quot;British&apos;in all official correspondence, public statements and informationmaterial.   Similarly, our representative in a Commonwealth country would be called the &quot;British High Commissioner&quot; just as our re -presentative in a foreign country is called the &quot;British Ambassador&quot;.The same would apply to Trade Commissioners.   The only exceptionswould be treaties and legal documents, where the use of the full andformal designation &quot;United -Kingdom of Great -Britain and NorthernIreland&quot; is necessary, and in the definition of citizenship.4.   I have, of course, considered the alternative of using the term-&quot;   Si.Britain&quot; rather than &quot;Britain&quot;;  but I have felt obliged to rejectthis, on the grounds  that it would inevitably be abbreviated into&quot;G. B. &quot;, which would be as unattractive as &quot;U.K. &quot;.5. Our High Commissioners in the Commonwealth countries stronglysupport the proposed change.6.   The Home Secretary, the Foreign Secretary and the President ofthe Board of Trade have been consulted and agree.7.   I accordingly seek the Cabinet&apos;s approval.Commonwealth Relations Office,24th March, l96l       CON FlDENTIAL
