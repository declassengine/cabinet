The Minister of Defence has authority to decide (subjectto the responsibilities of the Cabinet and the DefenceCommittee&apos;) all major matters of defence policy affecting the size, shape, organisation and disposition of the Armed forces and their weapons and war-like equipment and supply(including defence research and development) &quot;.Matters of concern to one Service only are dealt with in the memoranda on the individual Service Estimates thus avoidingduplication.
Report on Defence, 1961There is only one answer to the threat to mankind posed by armaments.This is to reach a satisfactory agreement on general disarmament undereffective international control. The Government intend to press for this byall means in their power; but we should not under-estimate the difficulties ofthe task, or the length of time that it may take to accomplish it.2. Although the Soviet leaders have recently declared their pacificintentions, and are making some reductions in Service manpower, the strengthof the Soviet forces remains very great. Mr. Khrushchev, when announcing the reductions, was at pains to say that their forces would not be weakened.In particular, he emphasised the great stocks of nuclear weapons and missilespossessed by the Soviet Union.3. The Soviet fleet of submarines is of great size. Mr. Khrushchev hasclaimed the possession of nuclear submarines. We must expect the numberof these to increase and that they will carry nuclear missiles. China alsomaintains very large armed forces.4. The Government welcome the statement that these weapons would only be used against an aggressor. Nevertheless, the existence of immensemilitary power in the Soviet bloc must be of deep concern to the West; nor can we ignore the rising power of China.5. Soviet or Chinese military strength could be used for direct offensive action against the Western Allies or for military intervention in inflammablesituations in any part of the world. In addition it can be, and is, used inconjunction with Communist subversive activities to exert political pressure on smaller countries, and to undermine their independence and will to resistoutside interference.DEFENCE policy. Until general disarmament has been achieved, peace rests on themaintenance of adequate power by the West to discourage aggression by theSoviet bloc or by China. Our own contribution to the deterrent strength ofthe West must itself be balanced both as against other demands on the economy, which we must satisfy if we are to hold our own in the struggleof competetive co-existence, and as to the proportion of our resourcesdevoted to the various components of the Defence programme. We seek to achieve the balance that will best serve our own military needs, as well asthe needs of the Western Alliance. In this we must recognise that many ofour most important responsibilities are not concerned with the directdeterrence of all out global war, but rather with the checking of smalloutbreaks which could grow into nuclear war by accident or design.7. Aggressors have the initiative, and often the advantage of surprise.It follows that a defence policy which satisfies the condition of economy of force, and presents in itself no threat of aggression, must depend on itsevident power of rapid and certain retaliation against any form of attack.58315c*
MAIN deployment of THE SERVICES
8. The primary purpose of our defence policy is, therefore, that it shouldprotect us, our allies and our friends against the whole spectrum of possibleaggression and military threats, from the small local action which might bethe beginning of larger and more dangerous adventures through &quot;nuclearblackmail&quot; to nuclear war.  We implement this policy in three main ways.9. First, we are founder members of the three Collective SecurityAlliances: NATO, CENTO and SEATO, and we make importantcontributions to all three.10. Secondly, we make our own contribution to the strategic nuclear deterrent forces of the West. Making full allowance for the growth of nuclear power in the world, our contribution still provides a valuable degreeof strength and diversity to the Western forces as a whole. It increasesdispersal and reduces reaction time. It provides powerful backing for ouralliances. The Government believe that it is in the national interest that weshould continue to share the burden and responsibility of maintaining this important element in the total power of the Western deterrent. our contribution also substantially increases our influence in negotiations for a nuclear test agreement, disarmament, and the reorganisation of NATOstrategy.11. Finally, we maintain increasingly efficient conventional forces,mobile and well armed, and organised and deployed to protect our interestsaround the world; by their very presence they make an effective contribution towards the maintenance of peace.12. Within this general framework, the deployment of our forces will beperiodically reviewed to make sure that it continues to meet changingconditions. We can expect that these reviews and the change-over to all-regular forces will lead to some reductions in our forces in overseas theatres,and economies in administrative and headquarters staffs.THE CONVENTIONAL FORCE13. Our conventional forces are now organised to provide militarycontributions to the three Collective Security Alliances and to our othergarrisons overseas, and also to provide a reserve of forces at home, in kenya and in Malaya.14. The preservation of peace and stability depends largely on theefficiency and state of readiness of our forces in all these areas. These arebeing steadily improved by such measures as the establishment of localstockpiles, increased facilities for the rapid air movement of troops andequipment, and by increased naval strength. The re-equipment programme is now providing the greater individual efficiency and fire power that is anessential element in the transition to smaller all-regular forces.15. Outside Europe our military organisation overseas now includestwo unified commands, which from 1st March will be known as the near east and Middle East Commands, with headquarters in Cyprus and Adenrespectively. The question of establishing a similar unified command inthe Far East is under examination.
THE NUCLEAR FORCE16. Our contribution to the strategic nuclear deterrent at present is theV-bomber force equipped with British free-falling nuclear bombs. The force has the capacity to penetrate to its assigned targets, and its retaliatorycapacity and efficiency are being constantly increased by wider dispersal andshorter reaction time.17. We expect that our main contribution to the Western deterrent overthe next decade will be provided by weapons carried in aircraft; and thetask of replacing the present type of V-bombers with improved Mk. IIversions is well in hand. To counter probable improvements in fighter andmissile defences, these aircraft will be given an increasing &quot;stand off&quot;capability over this period. The missiles which carry the British-madewarhead from the aircraft to its target must be of such type and characteristicsas will present the greatest diversity of attack. In this a number of systemshave their part to play. From British and American sources it is hoped toprovide Bomber Command with a combination of these methods.18. We also maintain in service a force of tactical aircraft equipped with nuclear as well as conventional weapons. Such aircraft are operated by the Royal Navy from carriers, as well as by the Royal Air Force. new types of aircraft for tactical and strategic roles will be able to make their attacks at very low levels, thus presenting a difficult problem of detectionand defence.NATO19. A large part of our defence effort is assigned to NATO,and it is Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy to continue to give full support to the Alliance.20. The problems arising from the increasing numbers and types of nuclear weapons now available to NATO members were considered at the nato Ministerial Council meeting last December.21. The Council took note of a United States suggestion that the concept of an M.R.B.M. multilateral force should be considered by NATO. TheCouncil also heard the views of other members and considered a proposal by Her Majesty&apos;s Government for a comprehensive study of the nucleararmoury in support of NATO with the purposes of making it as effective as possible without waste of resources and of strengthening the alliance. A full study of all these matters, including the United Kingdomproposal, is now being made.22. Britain already contributes Valiant jet bombers and Canberras to NATO tactical air forces. If the Alliance should decide to set up a stockpileor pool of nuclear weapons for the tactical role, we should be willing toparticipate, provided we were satisfied that political control was such as toensure rapid decisions in an emergency.INTERDEPENDENCE23. A narrow, nationalist policy for the choice and production of armsmakes no sense to-day. On the other hand, a monolithic system under central control, on the Communist model, would be unthinkable in the free world;
but we should disregard at our peril the strength that it gives to theCommunist world.24. Interdependence means more than bilateral or multilateral armsdeals, important as these are. The interchange of research and developmenttechniques, and the sharing of logistic and training facilities all have their part to play in strengthening the free world alliance, and in maintaining a firmdeterrent to would-be aggressors. We have been in the lead in offering theresults of our research and development efforts to NATO, and in offering to share support and training facilities. We agreed to provide facilities for adepot ship, and floating dock, in Holy Loch for United States polaris submarines as part of our contribution to strengthening the Alliance as awhole.25. We have put forward plans for accelerating progress towardsinterdependence by concentrating effort on a selected number of majorweapon projects. These plans were approved at the last meeting of the nato Defence Ministers, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government welcome thedecision taken at the NATO Council meeting in December last to press on with these projects to speedy results.26. Co-ordination of the needs of our own Services is of equal importance.There must be the maximum possible degree of harmonisation of service requirements throughout the research, development and production stages.In particular, special attention will be paid to this requirement in the planning of successors to the current generation of aircraft.DEFENCE PLANNING27. Because defence planning must match the changing intentions and capabilities of forces which may be opposed to us, there can be no finalityabout it.  Deployment and balance must be continually re-examined.28. Plans may also be radically affected by technological change. At this time of rapid scientific development, even advanced weapons are almost sureto be superseded by something still more advanced. If we are to maintain ourposition in the world, we must be ready to start new research projects,however complex they may be. Equally we must be ready to scrap anything that has served its purpose, become outmoded, or whose ultimate cost may prove to be beyond our resources.29. Both the United States and Russia spend on research anddevelopment alone sums greater than our total defence budget. We obviouslycannot afford to spend on this scale, yet we have to ensure that the quality of our defence research and development is at least equal, and that it isefficiently and economically carried out.30. It is also necessary to keep close watch on the tendency for the costof maintaining armed forces of a given size to rise steadily over the years.31. How to keep our place, to preserve a proper balance in our effort,and to avoid the risk of deploying our limited resources of manpower and money over too wide a field has been the subject of much study. some experience has now been obtained of the system of preparing in the early summer of each year a full forward costing of the defence programme,58315 p*
covering the following five financial years. By this means our forwardcommitments can bs balanced against the forward estimate of our means.This technique is still at an early stage of development and is capable offurther improvement; but it has already proved its worth. New methodshave also been introduced to ensure that research and development projectsare effectively monitored.THE SIZE OF OUR FORCES32. The Government are aiming at all-regular Forces of the order of88,000 for the Royal Navy, 165,000 to 180,000 for the Army and 135,000 forthe Royal Air Force. These figures exclude boys and women. A table showing the trend of strengths is at Annex 1, Table 1.These strengths have been established in the light of the following factors :(a) Our foreseeable commitments.(b) The increasing support to be obtained from civilianisation and theWomen&apos;s Services.(c) Increases in fire power and efficiency; the introduction of new types of aircraft into Transport Command; the introduction of thecommando carrier and the new concept of assault forces for the Navy.id) The reorganisation of the Territorial Army and the plans for the reserves.(e) The strength of local forces overseas.(/) A calculation of the size of all-regular forces that we can afford tomaintain and provide with up-to-date equipment.THE VOLUNTEER FORCES33. There is an element of risk in giving up conscription and relying onvolunteers. But the Government are satisfied that it is a risk that ought to beaccepted. Conscription makes heavy demands on the economy. The^efficiency of the Services is affected by the constant turn-over of men, and because the training task is out of proportion to the length of useful service;a much higher level of training and efficiency is attainable in an all-regularforce.34. The Government believe that the targets they have set are attainable.The Services now offer demanding, but attractive careers to men and women,as officers and other ranks. Plans have been made to see that, over the next twelve months, these advantages are brought home to young people themselves and to all those who influence them in their choice of a career.THE COST OF DEFENCE35. In 1961-62, the Defence Budget will total  1,655-6 million. It isexpected to absorb a somewhat smaller proportion of the Gross national product than it did in 1960-61, when the figure was 7-2 per cent.
36.   The total is distributed as follows:  millionAdmiralty       ............ 413-20War Office    ............... 506-90Air Ministry   ............... 526-67Ministry of Aviation............ 190-20Ministry of Defence............ 18-63Total    ............ 1,655-6037. Of this total some 52 per cent, is required for the pay, food, clothing,housing and movement of the forces.38. The greater part of the expenditure on Defence will continue to be devoted to the maintenance of conventional forces. Britain&apos;s contributionto the strategic nuclear capability of the West remains about 10 per cent,of the Defence Budget.TRENDS OF DEFENCE EXPENDITURE0.N.P AND DEFENCE EXPENDITURE AT CURRENT PRICESG.N.E AND DEFENCE EXPENDITURE AT CONSTANT prices defence  EXPENDITURE AS A % OF G.N.P.DEFENCE EXPENDITURE AS A &apos;A OF TOTALCENTRAL    GOVERNMENT  CURRENT   EXPENDITURE
CIVIL DEFENCE39. The Government have reviewed Home Defence plans and have concluded that some additional expenditure is needed in order to secure abetter balanced and realistic programme in which Government Departments,local authorities, and the essential services, together with the Civil DefenceCorps and the industrial civil defence organisations, can all play their part.40. For these purposes, the estimated defence expenditure of civil departments next year will be  18 58 million*. This compares with thefigure of  15-37 million* for the current, year.41. This revised programme will make possible improved progress withpreparations for a scheme of emergency control, including the provision ofemergency communications. The programme continues to provide for thedevelopment of defence planning for food and agriculture. Some additional provision is made for the maintenance and development of measures for oil storage and distribution; for the protection of public water supplies; for maintaining ports; shipping and railway movements; and for emergencymedical services. More training equipment will be provided for the civil defence Corps and the emergency fire service. There will be additional stock-piling of radiac equipment for the essential services. New steps will be takento stockpile equipment for operational fire-fighting. The warning andmonitoring system will be further developed and arrangements made to link it with the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System at Fylingdales.42. Co-operation in exercises and planning between the Services and civil authorities at all levels, will be further developed in order to ensurethat available Service manpower could be effectively deployed to aid thecivil power in war.CONCLUSION43. We have two main duties. Until a satisfactory agreement can bereached on general disarmament under effective international control we haveto maintain, in conjunction with our Allies, nuclear and conventional forces that will demonstrate to an aggressor that he cannot expect to obtainadvantage by resort to war. We also have to play our part in many partsof the world by maintaining conventional Forces to prevent or contain minorincidents which might otherwise develop into major conflicts.44. The responsibilities of defence are heavy. But we must not, andmost of us do not wish to, shed the burden. We have peace, and we believethat we can continue to have it if we are prepared to play our full part indeterring war. This is the inspiration and reward of those who serve thedefence of their country in many fields.* Both these figures exclude the capital expenditure of the Post Office, but includerental payments by Departments for Post Office Communications.
APPENDIXDEFENCE STATISTICS, 1961-62Manpower1. An analysis of the active strengths of the three Services is given in annex I, Table 1.2. In 1961-62 the Armed Forces will need about 46,000 male entrants.This figure includes men who enter upon regular engagements, and those whoenter as boys, apprentices and juniors.3. An analysis of the Volunteer Reserve and Auxiliary Forces and national Services Reserves for the three Services is given in Annex I, Table 2.finance.   The estimated cost of the defence programme is:  million(a) as estimated for 1960-61     .........      1,616-33*(b) as estimated for 1961-62      .........      1,655-60The figure for 1960-61 is before taking account of a German contribution of the deutschmark equivalent of  12 million towards the local costs of british forces in Germany.5.
