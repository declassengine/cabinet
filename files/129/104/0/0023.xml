ANNEXSUNDAY OBSERVANCE IN ENGLAND AND WALESExisting LawI -Public EntertainmentThe Sunday Observance Acts 1623, 1627 and 1677 are all obsolete. The firstprohibits the playing of games on Sundays out of one&apos;s own parish and it is thisstatute that is most often held up to ridicule. The Acts of 1627 and 1677 prohibitcertain old forms of travelling and working and the sale of goods on Sunday. Theyare both dead letters and Sunday trading is now dealt with under the Shops Act1950.The effective statute is the Sunday Observance Act, 1780, which forbids theopening on Sundays of any house, room or other place of entertainment oramusement to which the public is admitted on payment. In April 1956, the HighCourt decided that the word &quot; place &quot; includes a field or park in which open airevents are held. Some exceptions were made to the Act of 1780 by the SundayEntertainments Act, 1932, chiefly in respect of cinemas and musical concerts.Cinemas may open on Sundays, subject to a payment for charity, if public opinion in the local area declares itself in favour. Musical concerts (which include singingor recitation) may be given, museums, picture galleries, zoos and botanical gardensmay be opened and lectures and debates are allowed.The entertainments and sports to which the prohibition of the Act of 1780still applies include the following:(a) Theatres, variety entertainments, ballets and dancing.(b) Football, cricket, horse and dog racing, polo, boxing, motor-cycle racingand scrambles.There are widespread devices which are designed to evade the prohibitions of thelaw, for example, the formation of Sunday clubs and charges for special facilities(car parks and seating accommodation) and making a collection instead of a charge for admission.2. Sunday TradingThe law on Sunday trading, now consolidated along with other shops law inthe Shops Act, 1950, derives from two Acts of 1936 which were promoted by private Members. After laying down the general proposition that all shops shouldbe closed on Sundays, the law goes on to make numerous exceptions including thesale of liquor, meals, refreshments, milk, newly-cooked provisions, flowers, fruit and vegetables, sweets, tobacco, medicines, newspapers, sports requisites, motorsupplies and fodder for beasts of burden. In addition any local authority maymake an order permitting the sale of bread, fish and groceries until 10 a.m. on sunday morning, and in holiday resorts the local authority may make an orderallowing the sale on not more than 18 Sundays in the year of any article offood, requisites for bathing, fishing or photography, toys, souvenirs or fancy goods,books and stationery. These provisions give rise to many ambiguities anduncertainties which have been the subject of some acid comment by the courts and both shopkeepers and local authorities are left in considerable doubt as towhat they should observe and enforce.Public Opinion3. Public EntertainmentThe various opinions divide into three categories:(a) For the abolition of all restraint. This view does not appear to be widelyheld except perhaps by certain people in the entertainment world.(b) For the maintenance of the present position. The Lord&apos;s Day ObservanceSociety appears to be the chief organised body of opinion which holdsthis view and they have been very active recently in drawing attentionto infringements of the law.
(c) For some revision of the existing law. This view seems to attract mostsupport, including an influential body of church opinion, Members ofParliament, the Press and many individuals. There is, however, no agreement as to the nature and extent of the revision and a committee set up by the British Council of Churches in 1955, while recommending that there should be some relaxation, declared themselves unable tomake any specific proposals.4. Sunday TradingThere does not seem to be any widespread demand for repeal or substantialrelaxation of the Sunday trading restrictions as a whole. The Committee on the closing hours of shops under the Chairmanship of Sir Ernest Gowers recommended in 1947 that the list of Sunday exemptions should be rationalised; and an attemptto do so was made in the Shops Bill.The tourist and holiday trades have long been pressing for the number ofSundays on which certain goods may be sold in holiday resorts to be increased from 18. The Gowers Committee recommended that the number should beincreased to 23 but the traders want an increase to at least 26. On the other hand the Sabbatarians want no increase at all.Points for Consideration in any Revision of the Law5. Public EntertainmentShould all forms of public entertainment and sport with payment for admissionbe permitted? There appears to be no pressure for Sunday horse racing and littlefor professional football and cricket (except, possibly, for charity); and even theatreinterests have been strangely silent.Should any distinctions be drawn between amateur and professional sport?Or between entertainments or sports organised for profit and those organised forcharity or which are non-profit making?Should any measure of local option be allowed? There may be localdifferences of opinion, for example, between town and country and betweenthe North and South of England and, of course, Wales. The local optionarrangements for cinemas under the Act of 1932 are administratively cumbersomeand decisions against Sunday opening are now comparatively rare.Should there be any control of the entertainment permitted on Sundays,for example, the hours during which it may take place? If so, should restrictionsbe imposed by general legislation or by some local authority as in the case ofexisting licensing powers for Sunday cinemas and musical concerts?6. Sunday TradingThe alternatives apart from leaving the law in its present unsatisfactory state are:(a) Repeal of all restrictions on Sunday trading. Leaving aside theSabbatarian considerations, there is a case for this on merits. It seemspretty clear that in present-day conditions, the restrictions are notneeded (any more than are the weekday restrictions on shop hours)for the protection of shop assistants or shopkeepers and again like theweekday restrictions-it would be very difficult to put them on arational and generally acceptable basis. Repeal would, of course, be highly controversial; and it is clear that one of the most conspicuoussecular distinctions between Sundays and weekdays is the fact that most shops are closed on Sundays.(/;) To retain the substance of the present restrictions but try to rationalisethem on the lines of the Gowers Report and the Shops Bill, with or without some slight liberalisation, e.g., as regards the number ofSundays on which holiday goods may be sold in holiday resorts. Thiswould not be free from difficulty and would be little less controversial.February 1961.
