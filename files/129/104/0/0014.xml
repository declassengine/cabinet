Printed for the Cabinet.   February 1961C. (61) 14 Copy No. 322nd February, 1961CABINETSUNDAY OBSERVANCEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 21st July, 1960, the Cabinet approved in principle my proposal for theappointment of a Joint Select Committee on the law of Sunday Observance inEngland and Wales, but indicated that the opinion of Government supportersshould first be sounded (C.C. (60) 44th Conclusions, Minute 4). This has beendone: it seems that opinion is fairly evenly divided on the question whether any action should be taken at all, and that legislation, or an enquiry, after next session would be quite unacceptable.2. It is unfortunately clear that it would not be possible for a select committeeto take evidence and reach conclusions, for the Government to consider thoseconclusions and for a Bill to be drafted in time for next session. But I should bevery reluctant not to tackle this problem at all. The arguments against leaving inforce laws which touch the ordinary behaviour of the community but are out ofharmony with modern habits and ideas apply very strongly to the Sundayrestrictions. I should therefore like to keep up the momentum, but in such away as to avoid so far as possible making Sunday Observance a matter of currentpolitical interest.3. In these circumstances I now think that the better plan will be to appoint a departmental committee. The terms of reference would be &quot; To review the law(other than the Licensing Acts) relating to Sunday entertainments, sports, pastimesand trading in England and Wales, and to make recommendations &quot;. I have itin mind to ask Lord Amory to become Chairman of the committee, and that membership should include two Members of Parliament from each side of theHouse, a Welsh representative, a woman, a lawyer and a trade unionist.4. I shall be glad to have the views of my colleagues on this proposal. the timing of the committee&apos;s appointment will require careful consideration, bearing that mind that they will be likely to take 18 months to 2 years to take evidence and prepare their report.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,2nd February, 1961.58437THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
