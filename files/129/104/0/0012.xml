(61) 1213th February, 1961Copy No.32CABINETDEFENCE FACILITIES FOR FORCES OF THE federal german government memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home DepartmentFollowing the discussion on 7th February (C.C. (61) 5th Conclusions,Minute 5), I should like to bring to the notice of my colleagues certainconsiderations arising from the proposal that German troops should train in thiscountry.2. If, as I assume, the Federal German Forces in this country were to be a self-contained, self-disciplined unit, it would be necessary to extend to them someof the powers, privileges and exemptions which are afforded by the Visiting forces act, 1952, and the Application of Law Orders made under that Act. Twoinstruments would be necessary: an Order in Council under section 1 (2) of the visiting Forces Act designating the Federal Republic as a country to which theAct applied, and an Order under section 8, applying the existing Application ofLaw Order, or possibly a new versiorCOf it, to the Federal German Visiting Force.The effect would be to give the authorities of the Visiting Force power to exercisejurisdiction over their own members; to exempt members of the Force from thejurisdiction of our courts in respect of offences committed against other membersof the Force or persons connected with them, or in the course of their duty; andto extend to the Force exemptions from a number of United Kingdom enactmentswhich are enjoyed by our own Forces.3. The Order extending the Application of Law Order would requireaffirmative resolutions of both Houses; and it is clear that any such resolutionswould be strenuously opposed. The task of the Home Office Minister would notbe made any easier by the fact that the Federal German Government are unlikely,as I understand it, to have ratified the North Atlantic Treaty Status of ForcesAgreement by the time these matters would have to be put to Parliament.4. I have no exact information as to the final scale and duration of thetraining which is in contemplation, and the areas which will eventually be used,but wrongly handled we could not rule out the possibility of breaches of the lawby demonstrators who would have some public sympathy behind them.5. These considerations are not decisive but we should certainly have themin mind.R. A.
