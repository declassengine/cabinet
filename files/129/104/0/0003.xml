ANNEX a commonwealth YOUTH TRUSTDRAFT GOVERN MENT ANNOUNCEMENTQuestionTo ask /   the Prime Minister or the Commonwealth Secretary^whether he will make a statement on the setting up of a CommonwealthYouth Trust.AnswerYes, Sir.    A  Committee was set up in February, 1959, under theChairmanship of Field Marshal Sir Gerald Templer to make a confidentialreport to Ministers on certain proposals previously outlined for setting upa Commonwealth Youth Trust.    I should like to pay tribute toSir Gerald Templer and all those who were associated with him on theCommittee, and to record Her Majesty&apos;s Governments deep appreciation of their willingness to devote so much of their time to this important task.Their report recommends the establishment of a Trust, financedmainly from private subscriptions, whose fundamental object would be tostrengthen Commonwealth bonds through its younger people.The Trust would pursue this object by encouraging the activitiesof existing organisations and by fostering the development of new projects in this field.    One of the main functions proposed for the Trust was thebuilding of a Commonwealth Youth City in London, to accommodate5,000 students, at a capital cost of some  10 millions.    For thisparticular purpose the Committee recognised that considerable Exchequerfinance would be necessary.The Government fully endorse the view that the bonds between thecountries of the Commonwealth can be strengthened through the activitiesof their younger people, and they are sympathetically disposed towardsthe establishment of a Trust for the purpose.    They are, however, advised that this is not a suitable moment at which to launch a public appear forfunds for such a Trust, in view of other appeals of a similar nature whichare currently being made.    The timing of such an appeal needs to be very carefully considered, and the Government will keep this question underreview.Meanwhile, the Government will continue to consider on their merits applications for assistance from public funds for specific organisa-tions and projects to further the interests of young people throughout theCommonwealth, and they hope that as heretofore private support for suchwill not be lacking even in the absence of a Trust specifically concernedwith this work.
The Government share the view of the Committee that one of themost urgent needs is to provide increased hostel accommodation foroversea students.    They do not consider that the establishment of a commonwealth Youth City in London would be the best way of dealing withthis problem.     This would be essentially a long-term project whichwould not yield results quickly enough.    Moreover, it would not benefit the considerable numbers of Commonwealth and other oversea students and trainees who are following courses of higher education and trainingoutside London.To meet this urgent need the Government have decided to undertake a programme for providing 5,000 new hostel places for oversea studentsin various parts of the country over and above those now available.In addition, a number of new or enlarged British Council social and cultural centres for Commonwealth and oversea students will be provided in various towns where the population of oversea students has greatlyexpanded in recent years.     The capital cost of this programme will beabout  3 millions over a number of years.    There are, of course, alarge number of voluntary organisations active in the work of studentwelfare-   and, although the Government are prepared to make a substantial contribution to the capital cost of the new hostel programme, they trust that these organisations will bear some share in meeting this cost, aswell as in the expenses of running the hostels with which they are associatedThe Government are anxious to take advantage of the knowledge and experience of these voluntary organisations, and they have authorised theBritish Council to open discussions with them on this programme, inconsultation with the educational and training institutues to which the students will be attached.January, 1961-2-
.&apos; .....-confidential annex draft SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS OFTEMPLER COMMITTEEGENERALA Trust concerned with younger people in the Commonwealth is an   iurgent need.    In conformity with normal Commonwealth practice, no attempt should be made to create an all-Commonwealth Trust:  a startshould be made with a Trust based on the United Kingdom, in the hope andexpectation that other Commonwealth countries would soon join in or else    jdevelop comparable bodies of their own.The fundamental object of any Trust must be to strengthen Common-!wealth ties through its younger people.A Trust must pursue positively and without compromise a policyof promoting inter-racial friendship and service to the community and it ison that policy that its appeal to the younger people of the Commonwealthmust be based.A Trust ls basic approach should be, firstly, to provide a centralinformation centre on what is being done in the Commonwealth contextaffecting younger people in the broadest sense;   secondly, to secure, byexhortation or finance, the development of existing activities contributing to the  fundamental object;   and thirdly, to secure, again by exhortation orfinance, the development in neglected spheres of new activities contributingin a oimilar way.A.Trust should finance activities through other bodies chosen asinstruments ;(which might well be changed from time to time), and should confine its direct activities to those needed for its function as a centralstimulus.A Trust should be prepared to give bold assistance to newactivities which it is pioneering, but normally with the aim of being ableto discontinue that assistance after a due period, e.g. , about five to seven years, unless for particular activities continued assistance appeared to bewarranted.A Trust should concentrate on potential leaders in all walks of life and not merely on the student class.    In accordance, with the impetusof the Trust, the links with these potential leaders should, where at allpossible, be forged by bringing them into contact on an equal basis withtheir opposite numbers in the United Kingdom so that each can learn fromthe other, develop their personal qualities together, or give service tothe community side by side.A Trust should supplement its concentration on potential leaders in all walks of life by seeking to influence the mass of young people, notonly through those having influence on them but also by fostering Common-wealth events and institutions and by seeking to promote through publicitythe values implicit in the Commonwealth.-3-CONFIDENT1AL
YOUNGER PEOPLE FROM THE COMMONWEALTH IN THE UNITEDKINGDOMA Trust should make the creation and endowment of a Common-wealth Youth City in London in the next ten years its second and perhapsits main role.Governmental help should be provided to effect as a matter of urgency the short-term improvements in hostel provision.    But hostelprovision on a vastly greater scale is needed to make the right sort ofimpact on this large and important problem.Governmental help should be provided to improve provision forclub facilities at certain key points.A Trust should work for, and if necessary finance, the greaterinvolvement of voluntary youth organisations in immigrant problems.Moreover, subject to investigation of the possibilitiesj a Trust mightwell be able to stimulate older age groups, e. g. , students and young workers, to give help with these problems.A Trust should apply a further stimulus to the welcome given tooversea students by the community and should assist the British Counciland other voluntary bodies in endeavours to secure an increasedcontribution of hospitality by specialist bodies which have something in common with particular groups of oversea students, e.g. , law, engineer-ing, trade unions, sports associations, etc. , and to ensure that arrivingCommonwealth students have for a few days the services of their oppositenumbers in this country as &quot;guides, philosophers and friends&quot;.A Trust should try to help directly to overcome any colour baroperating in vacation jobs for students, by enlisting the support of firms.A Trust should study the means necessary, and be ready to devote finance, to ensure a greater mixture of Commonwealth studentswith home students in vacation courses.A Trust should, with due discretion and imagination and inconsultation with the British Council, student bodies and personnelofficers, provide stimulus and finance to promote joint activities involvinghome and Commonwealth students in which non-Commonwealth studentswould be invited to join.A Trust should explore the possibilities of advanced Commonwealthstudy couroes for students in consultation with such bodies as theBritish Council, Commonwealth Institute, Royal Commonwealth Society,Industrial Welfare Society and universities and learned societies withspecial knowledge of Commonwealth problems.A Trust should explore the possibility of service of all kinds by commonwealth students and make a serious attempt to foster this inco-operation with any appropriate bodies.A Trust should seek the co-operation of a bank in the problem of commonwealth students who find themselves in acute financial difficulty
and should provide a loan fund to be operated on its behalf by someappropriate voluntary body in cases where a bank is unable to help,BRITISH PEOPLE OVERSEASA Trust should examine the possibility of helping the developmentof work of the Oversea Service type.A Trust should regard preliminary preparation as an essential part of the operation of sending young people overseas for activitiessponsored by it and should, if necessary, apply finance to ensure thatthe right preparation is given.A Trust should explore and, if necessary, finance the developmentof summer schools for young people between eighteen and twenty-fouryears of age embodying the Oversea Service idea, either under the aegis of Oversea Service or, using the experience of Oversea Service, inconnection with existing organisations promoting summer schools, which-ever arrangement appeared most useful and practical at the time.PROMOTION OF INTER-COMMONWEALTH ACTIVITY:   CONTACTSAMONG YOUNG PEOPLE UP TO ABOUT SEVENTEEN OR eighteen years OF AGEA Trust should, through appropriate organisations, for instanceteachers&apos; organisations, seek to ensure that links between schools andyouth groups in this country and their opposite numbers in the Common-wealth are now vigorously fostered and continually promoted.    Arrange-ments should be made by which older Commonwealth school children canattend linked schools in this country, and vice versa.A Trust should also explore the possibilities of apprenticeshipinterchange and be prepared to stimulate experiment with some financeif necessary.PROMOTION OF INTER-COMMONWEALTH ACTIVITY;  CONTACTSAMONG STUDENTS AND YOUNG WORKERSObjects of high priority for a Trust should include, the extensionof activities on the lines of &quot;Voluntary Service Overseas&quot;, due regard being paid to the action of the British Council in this field;   ensuring that these activities are administered by a suitable permanent body orbodies;  a readiness at the initial stage of development, to financevolunteers from other Commonwealth lands;  and /   an effort toobtain for volunte ers the title of &quot;Queen&apos;s Commonwealth Volunteers&quot;when the extended scheme had got satisfactorily under way/.A Trust should foster a variety of activities involving shortervisits overseas.A Trust should explore through the relevant United Kingdomstudent bodies the possibility of helping students to take advantage of opportunities for vacation employment, e.g., in Canada,-5-
THE &quot;WELFARE&quot; OF YOUNGER PEOPLEA Trust should leave Commonwealth co-operation in the formalsystem of education to governmental activity.A Trust should maintain information on co-operativeactivities by Commonwealth Governments in technical assistance andon the training activities of British firms with interests overseas, andshould encourage, but without applying finance, any extension of theactivities of these firms that appears desirable.A Trust should, in consultation with the British Council as necessary, explore the Commonwealth activities of United Kingdomspecialist groups (including examining bodies) of all types with a viewto stimulating, without using its own finance, any necessary develop-ments.    A particular aspect of this problem is to ensure that youngUnited Kingdom professional men who might wish to spend a short timeoverseas in professional jobs, after they qualify and before settling downin the United Kingdom, are not discouraged from doing so byprofessional rules or practice.  A Trust should, in consultation with the Trades Union congress and other bodies, promote a study with a view to furthering any necessarydevelopments in trade union co-operation within the Commonwealth:what is in question is a Trust acting as a stimulus rather than a providerof money, although it should be prepared to spend money to initiatedevelopment^/A Trust should assist with finance certain specified types of activity by voluntary youth organisations based on the United Kingdomprovided the activity in question is related to the needs of the developingcountry concerned and can reasonably be expected to make an appreciable impact on them.A Trust should finance the development of the work of theBritish National Committee of the World Assembly of Youth and of theCommonwealth Youth Council, primarily with a view to furtheringpractical inter-Commonwealth co-operation on youth problems.A Trust should -(a) promote some research into youth problems in the developing countries and high-light successfulexperiment;(b) initiate a study of the most effective ways of drawing on relevant United Kingdom experience and goodwill;(c) finance the raxchange of successful Commonwealthexperience at as high a level as possible;   and(d) be prepared to help with new youth experiments ofa quite special kind in any Commonwealth country.-6-
A Trust should explore the possibilities of helping to develop a commonwealth Study Centre in consultation with experienced bodies.COMMONWEALTH EVENTS AND INSTITUTIONSA Trust should seek to support and develop Commonwealth events and institutions affecting younger people.GENERALIf the Government decide to commend proceeding with theestablishment of a Trust on the lines outlined, substantial government finance would be needed at one or more stages.The establishment of a Trust should if possible be synchronisedwith a Commonwealth Year.January, 1961-7-
