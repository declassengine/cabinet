ANNEXDECISIONS ON CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL LABOUR CONVENTIONSI V. AND RECOMMENDATIONSTEXT OF PROPOSED WHITE PAPERINTERNATIONAL- LABOUR CONFERENCEThere are set out below the decisions of Her Majesty&apos;s Government on aConvention and Recommendation adopted by the International LabourConference at its 42nd Sesion in 1958, three Conventions and a Recommendationadopted at the 43rd Session in 1959 and a Recommendation adopted at the44th Session in 1960. The texts of the intruments adopted at the three Sessionswere presented to Parliament in Cmnd. 593, Cmnd. 923 and Cmnd. 1189respectively.Convention No. 110 and Recommendation No. 110 Concerning Conditions ofEmployment of Plantation workers the Convention, adopted by the International Labour Conference in 1958,lays down standards covering many aspects of conditions of employment for workers on plantations in tropical and sub-tropical regions. Ratification wouldhave no relevance in the United Kingdom itself, but would entail applying theConvention in the majority of the overseas territories to the extent permitted bylocal conditions. The Convention has 12 substantive sections. Very largelythese consist of provisions taken from 18 other Conventions, which nearly all cover plantation workers, among others, already. All but three of theseConventions-are already applied in United Kingdom overseas territories, so thatthe application of this Convention there would have little practical significanceand would not meet any specialised need. Our delegation to the Conference,after consultation with overseas Governments, pointed out the undesirability ofa Convention applying to a particular group of workers standards designed to beapplied to workers generally.The Government accordingly do not propose to ratify the Convention or toaccept the accompanying Recommendation.Convention No. 112 Concerning the Minimum Age for Admission to employment as FishermenThe Convention provides that children under the age of 15 years shall not beemployed or work on fishing vessels except in certain defined circumstances, andthat young persons under the age of 18 years shall not be employed or work on coal-burning vessels as trimmers or stokers. All vessels engaged in maritimefishing come within the scope of the Convention.Existing law in the United Kingdom is largely but not entirely in conformitywith the provisions of the Convention. In particular there is no prohibition on theemployment of children in family vessels, though the extent of such employment is greatly restricted by the requirements of full-time education. Young personsmay also be employed as trimmers or stokers in certain circumstances not permitted by the Convention. The Government propose to take a suitable opportunity tointroduce the legislation necessary to bring about complete conformity with theConvention, and thereafter to ratify it.Convention No. 113 Concerning the Medical Examination of FishermenThe Convention provides that no one may be employed on a fishing vesselwithout having a certificate signed by an approved medical practitioner attestingto his fitness to do the work concerned.  In the case of persons under 21 years of
age the certificate has to be renewed annually. The period of validity for certificatesfor persons who have reached the age of 21 is to be determined by the obmpetentauthority.  :i &apos; .;&apos; t&apos;.:&quot;. T&apos;In the United Kingdom young persons under the age of 18 yearsemployed on a fishing vessel must have a medical certificate,, which has to beI -renewed annually, certifying their fitness for the work which they are to perform.v. 0n the other hand, medical certificates are not required for those who have reachedthe age of 18. Certificates are not required for persons who have reached the ageof 18 either in the Merchant Navy, where conditions similar to those in the fishing industry are to be found, or in industry generally, and there is no evidence to showthat differential treatment for fishermen is necessary or desirable. The government do not therefore propose to ratify the Convention.Convention No. 114 Concerning Fishermen&apos;s Articles of agreement the Convention lays down requirements concerning articles of agreement forfishermen. The articles are to be signed by the owner of the fishing vessel or his representative and by the fisherman, under conditions and safeguards prescribed by law, and are to contain certain specified particulars. A record of employment is to be maintained for every fisherman and at the end of each voyage or venturea record of service is to be available to the fisherman or entered in his service book.The competent authority is required to lay down the measures to be taken to enableclear information to be obtained on board as to the conditions of employment.National law, collective agreements or individual agreements are to determine thecircumstances in which a fisherman may be discharged or demand discharge. TheConvention includes in its scope all fishing vessels engaged in maritime fishing in saltwaters, but the competent authority may exempt from its application fishing vessels of a type and size determined after consultation with the fishing-boat owners&apos; andfishermen&apos;s organisations concerned.In the United Kingdom law and practice so far as fishermen employed ontrawlers of 25 tons and upwards are concerned is in conformity with the provisionsof the Convention, except in one respect; there are no statutory requirementsconcerning the measures to be taken to enable clear information as to conditions ofemployment to be obtained on board the vessel. The Government intend to take asuitable opportunity to introduce legislation to bring about conformity with theConvention in this respect and also to consult with fishing-boat owners&apos; andfishermen&apos;s organisations concerning the type and size of fishing-vessels to be exempted from the application of the provisions of the Convention. TheGovernment propose to ratify the Convention thereafter.Recommendation No. 112 Concerning Occupational Health Services in Places ofEmploymentThe Recommendation concerns the establishment and development of occupational health services in industrial, non-industrial and agriculturalundertakings and public services, with the aim of extending them to cover all workers. It provides (paragraph 4) that where such services cannot immediately beset up for all undertakings, priority should be assigned to :(a) undertakings where the health risks appear greatest;(b) undertakings where the workers are exposed to special health hazards;(c) undertakings which employ more than a prescribed minimum number ofworkers.In considering their attitude to the provision that the aim should be to extendoccupational health facilities to all workers, the Government have had in mind thefollowing considerations:(1) In this country the National Health Service provides comprehensive medical services for the population in general.   Government schemes providefor the rehabilitation and training of the disabled.   Legislation lays&quot;) down the basic requirements for safeguarding the health, safety and welfare of workers in industry and agriculture, and the Government have announced their intention of introducing legislation dealing with the health, safety and welfare of non-industrial workers in shops, offices and certain other establishments.
(2) It is the Governments policy to encourage the development of industrialmedical services within this framework. Medical and nursing services are already provided by many industrial undertakings. In additionin some places with special circumstances a number of firms have joinedin the provision of a &quot;group&quot; service, and the possibilities ofestablishing similar group schemes in other areas are being explored.-The Government agree generally with the priorities already mentioned as suggested in the Recommendation, but do not consider it practicable at the presenttime to envisage the extension of occupational health services to cover all workersin whatever form of employment they may be.While not in all respects fitting the conditions in this country, paragraphs 6-21of the Recommendation contain a useful statement regarding the functions of occupational health services, which it emphasises should have an essentiallypreventive role, and regarding personnel and equipment. The Government proposeto draw this statement to the attention of those concerned with the running of such services in a publication which will deal with the subject from the standpoint of conditions and practices in this country.The Recommendation concludes (paragraphs 22 to 25) with a number ofgeneral provisions which are acceptable to the Government. These provide thatworkers and their organisations should co-operate fully in attaining the objectives of occupational health services, that such services should not involve the workersin expense and that, where national laws or regulations do not provide otherwise,and in the absence of agreement between the parties, the cost of the services shouldbe borne by the employer. The final paragraph (paragraph 25), which providesthat national laws or regulations should specify the authority responsible for supervising the organisation and operation of the services, is accepted withreference to those industrial health services which are the subject of statutory requirements in this country, for example, the medical examinations that areobligatory under the Factories Acts.Recommendation No. 113 Concerning Consultation and Co-operation between public Authorities and Employers&apos; and Workers&apos; Organisations at theIndustrial and National LevelsThe Recommendation provides that measures appropriate to nationalconditions should be taken to promote effective consultation and co-operation atthe industrial and national levels between public authorities and employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations, as well as between those organisations. The generalobjective should be to promote mutual understanding and good relations with aview to developing the economy, improving conditions of work and raisingstandards of living. To this end there should be joint consideration by employers&apos;and workers&apos; organisations of matters of mutual concern and consultation by public authorities with these organisations on legislation affecting their interests,on the establishment and functioning of national bodies responsible for labourand social matters and on plans for economic and social development. Inaccordance with national custom or practice, the provisions of the recommendations should be given effect by action on the part of employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisationsor by public authorities or by legislation or by a combination of any of these methods.The provisions of the Recommendation are in harmony with law and practice in the United Kingdom, where consultation and co-operation at the industrial and national levels have already been developed to a high degree. Within thescope of their responsibility the Government intend to maintain these arrangements and if necessary to develop them further along established lines. The government therefore accept the Recommendation.February 1961.
