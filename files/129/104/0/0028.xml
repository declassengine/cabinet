DOCUMENT IS THiJPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)Oj6l) 28 COPY NO. ^ VIs^marclijjlallCABINETUNEMPLOYMENT IN NORTHERN IRELANDMgj^pyandurn by. the Sgcrotary oi^tate^ov^theHome department the Northern Ireland Government see this problem with most anxious concern.   At mid-February 8.1 per cent of insured employees inNorthern Ireland were out of work.   Messrs. Harland and Wolff willprobably be forced by lack of orders to lay off several thousand men in thenext few months.   The restrictions on credit have adversely affected anumber of firms in Northern Ireland.   It is expected that the rate ofunemployment will remain over 8 per cent next June.2.   Northern Ireland Ministers are disheartened that this situation should have arisen despite all their efforts since the war to increaseemployment and to strengthen Northern Ireland&apos;s economy.   They are undersevere political pressure to take effectu.r.1 action, or to press the UnitedKingdom Government to do so.   They feel that they have done all they canwith their limited powers, and that it is now up to the United KingdomGovernment to step in with a solution.   They would like us to agree atleast that the unemployment problem in Northern Ireland is a joint res -ponsibility of the two Governments, and that the circumstances of NorthernIreland are so exceptional that they justify special treatment, beyond thataccorded to a.ny other part of the United Kingdom.3.   The Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, Lord Erookeborough,expanded on this theme when he saw the Prime Minister and me on18th November.   He said that a Departmental Committee in NorthernIreland were urgently examining all possible proposals for relievingunemployment, in the short and the long term, and that Northern ireland ministers hoped shortly to be able to submit concrete proposals to her majesty&apos;s Government.    The Prime Minister assured him that theseproposals would be given most careful study by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentin so far as it was within their power to help.   I was asked to co-ordinateconsideration of the proposals.4.   The memorandum submitted by the Northern Ireland Governmentjust before Christmas is attached (Annex II).   In his covering letterLord Brookeborough said that the Northern Ireland Cabinet were unanimouslyof the opinion that the proposals in the memorandum offered the best chanceof progressively reducing the total of unemployed persons in Northern Ireland;the Northern Ireland Cabinet also considered that, without the acceptanceof the exceptional measures put forward by them, the level of unemployment was likely to increase in the future.   Northern Ireland Ministers had wished-1-
to discuss with United Kingdom Ministers in London, before submittingtheir proposals, the question of special treatment for Northern Ireland.Evidently they had hoped for a prior decision by Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentthat such treatment would be justified.   I replied that we thought it wouldbe mere fruitful for Ministers of the two Governments to have a discussionlater on the basis of the Northern Ireland Governments concreteproposals.   Lord Brookeborough ha.s asked that there sh; uld be such a discussion as soon as possible, before any final decisions are taken. Ishould like tc offer him a discussion this month.5.     Officials of the Home Office, the Treasury, the Board of Trade,the Ministry of Transport, the Ministry of Aviation, the Admiralty,the Ministry of Labour, the Ministry of Housing and Local Government,the Ministry of Pensions-and National Insurance and the Inland Revenue,have examined the Northern Ireland Governments proposals.   Theirreport (attached as Annex I) shows that v/e shall have to explain to northern Ireland Ministers thc.t most of their proposals are, for various reasons, impracticable or unacceptable.   This will certainly be adisappointment, even though in several instances we shall merely berepeating what we have already said in the past.6.      Apart from the enquiry into cross channel shipping services, whichhas already been announced, and our agreement to the renewal of thelegislation on the payment of capital grants to industry in Northern Ireland,Northern Ireland Ministers will be returning to Northern Ireland withempty hands.      There will ba considerable dissatisfaction in NorthernIreland, and the Ulster Unionist M. P.&apos;s will be likely to voice theircriticisms in the House of Commons.   It will not be easy to convinceNorthern Ireland that Her Majesty.&apos;s Government are genuinely concerned to do what they can to help, and that the lack of any immediate and positiveresults is the inescapable consequence of hard economic fa.cts.   Yet theexistence of these facts also makes it advisable to avoid giving promises,which we might well be unable to keep, of long term measures.7.     A summary is attached of the Northern Ireland Government&apos;sproposals and of the comments on them in the i-eport by officials.   This,together with the conclusions set out in the final   paragraph of the report,indicate briefly the particular points on which decisions are required before the meeting with Northern Ireland Ministers.R.

ANNEX      report 3Y OFFICIALS ON THE PROPOSALS BY THE NORTHERN IBELANDfiOVERHMENT FOR THE RELIEF OF UNEllPLOYI^NT IN NORTHERN ireland,     GENERALThe nature of the problem1,     Northern. Ireland is relatively poor in natural resouroes,and its industry is handicapped by extra transport costs resultingfrom separation by the sea from Great Britain, which is both themain source of Northern Ireland&apos;a fuel and raw materials and themain market for its products.     No other single area of theUnited Kingdom of comparable size and population suffers from thiscombination of disadvantages.     Their result, if economic forces were allowed free play, would be a lower standard of living inNorthern Ireland than in Great Britain.     During and since the war,however, the general level of wages in Northern Ireland hasincreasingly approached the British level.      In a number ofNorthern Ireland industries wage rates are governed by national agreements negotiated by Trades Unions which operate throughout theUnited Kingdom.     There is no prospect of workers in NorthernIreland agreeing to accept lower wages so as to offset NorthernIreland&apos;s other disadvantages as a location for industry.     TheNorthern Ireland Government are firmly committed to maintaining the same standard of social services in Northern Ireland as inGreat Britain.     Moreover, in recent years they have, with ourencouragement, undertaken public works, such as building schools,hospitals and roads, on a greater scale than in Great Britain,since Northern Ireland was less well provided with these facilitiesthan the rest of the United Kingdom, and it is better to pay wages for useful work than to pay unemployment benefit and national assistance.2.     These factors are reflected in a persistently and considerably higher average rate of unemployment.     On 16th January there were over 39,000 persons registered as unemployed, a rate of 8.1$ ofthe insured population, compared with 1 ,9% in Great Britain.SEC it 1ST
SECRET 112(The rate for men was This rate could not bo expected jeven in a favourable economic climate, to fall to the Britishlevel without governmental action.      Constitutionally the NorthernIreland unemployment problem is the responsibility of the NorthernIreland Government, who have concentrated their efforts since thewar on encouraging industrial development and the diversificationof Northern Ireland&apos;s industrial structure.      They have done thisprincipally by paying capital grants to help firms to set up newenterprises or to expand existing ones, and to established firmsmo help them modernise their equipment, by building factories inadvance of actual requirements-, and by charging a low rental forKactorics leased by industrialists.     The United Kingdom GovernmentRave helped by encouraging likely firms with new projects to considerpoing to Northern Ireland,I,    These measures have had considerable success.     Northernroland&apos;s economic structure is now more broadly based, and leansIsss heavily on ship-building, textiles and agriculture.     but because of the decline in employment in these traditional industries,&apos;lid the natural growth of the working population, they have doneittlo more than prevent the proportion of unemployed from rising,fcere remains no early prospect of unemployment being brought downjgpreciably nearer the British level.P present diffimiltlna1960 was a good year for Northern Ireland.     The number ofinkers in employment, and the value of their production, were theIghost ever recorded;    unemployment was on average the lowest forWv years.     The number of new undertakings and of expansiontomes announced (resulting in some U,500 now iobs, eventually,)I the best for a decade.      But the main reason for the Northernland Government&apos;s concern is an expected number of redundancies ofQ0 dobs this year at Harland and Wolffs.     All their efforts mayP- be more than offset by the difficulties of the shipbuildinglistry.     They are also worried because the United Kingdom
Ira V* 8% &amp;*, 1Government&apos; s restrictions on credit, which have particularly affected consumer goods industries in Northern Ireland, haveshown that some of the new industries attracted to NorthernIreland since the war have/put down deep roots, and are quite ready to consider leaving Northern Ireland when difficulties arise.     The recent increases in sea freight rates and in coal prices have emphasised the vulnerable position in which NorthernIreland&apos;s geographical situation and lack of natural resourcesplace her.     The possibility that Harland and Wolff will notrecover quickly from the expected decline in employment, andthat the aircraft firm of Short and Harland will also decline,and the difficulty of maintaining indefinitely a large programmeof public works, all point to the likelihood of unemploymentremaining at no less than its present level for several years tocome.     The Northern Ireland case is that these facts show thatthe remedies which have been tried up to now are insufficient,and that something more is wanted.II.     THE NORTHERN IRELAND GOVERNMENT&apos; S memorandum the introductory parap;raphs5-     The Northern Ireland Government suggest that, since the major economic controls are in the hands of the United KingdomGovernment, and the Northern Ireland Government cannot undertakesubstantial additional expenditure without the Treasury&apos;s agreements the solution of the unemployment problem must be regarded as ajoint responsibility of the two Governments.     We do not thinkthat United Kingdom Ministers will wish to express unreservedagreement to this proposition.    In the fields where the UnitedKingdom government are responsible they are responsible for-theUnited Kingdom as a whole.     They decide their policy so as toserve the interests of the whole country.     The Northern IrelandG-overnment seem to appreciate that most financial controls, forinstance, must- necessarily operate throughout the United kingdom as a single unit.     For example, Northern Ireland could notpracticably be protected from the effects of restrictions on hire-3-
purchase because most of the Northern Ireland output of consumercoo&amp;s is sold in Great Britain,     We recommend that ministers should 20 no further than to reaffirm their resolve to do allthat is possible to help and support the Northern ireland government in dealing with the problem of unemployment in NorthernIreland, and should not accept any direct or joint responsibilityfor this problem as such,6.     The Northern Ireland Government particularly ask that everyinfluence should be brought to bear on suitable large scaleindustries to make them consider expansion in Northern Ireland.Wo do not think anything more could be done here by the UnitedKingdom Government than is being done.    The Government have no positive powers to direct expanding industries into particularlocalities.     Northern Ireland would not bo a suitable locationfor the steel and motor industries, and there was never any serioussuggestion that these industries should be pressed to go there.With one possible exception no similar large scale expansions, ofindustries suitable for Northern Ireland, arc in prospect.(The exception is British Enkalon, a joint project by the Dutchfirm AKU and British Enka to set up a large nylon plant, probably in either Scotland or Northern Ireland, at a cost of about  12m.Eventually the new plant would give employment for some 2,500workers.)     The Northern Ireland Government also suggest that thereshould be a careful study of what further long term measures eouldbe introduced.     We deal with this possibility in Part III of thisReport,The individual proposals*     Reimbursement of employers1 National Insurance contributionsAlthough the working group on employment policy in NorthernIreland were favourably disposed to this proposal in 1952, it was subsequently rejected by the Cabinet, mainly because of the generalrepercussions on the National Insurance scheme.     The reasons forthe rejection are as cogent today as in 1952.     The national insurance schemes in Great Britain and Northern Ireland are
identical, and are operated as one.      Thus any reduction of theburden on contributors in Northern Ireland would be bound to leadto requests for similar treatment in Great Britain.     Since itwould be known that the current difficulties of Harland and Wolffwere one of the main reasons for introducing this concession, theship builders on the Clyde and the Tyne would bo particularly likelyto press for the same treatment.      It would also be difficult tojustify increasing the Exchequer support for the National(K.Insurance scheme in Northern Ireland at        time when the unitedKingdom Government&apos;s policy has been to reduce the measure of exchequer support in Great Britain,     Even if these objectionscould be overcome,  it would remain doubtful whether this scheme would be the best method of subsidising employers in NorthernIreland.   The subsidy would bo indiscriminate, and most of themoney would be paid to employers already established in NorthernIreland and who already employed large numbers of workers.      Itmight be possible to restrict the scheme to manufacturing industry of the type the Northern Ireland Government wish to encourage,but there would be difficult problems of definition.   Once thescheme had been introduced it v/ould be very difficult to bring itto an end even if it proved unsuccessful.8.     Industrial do-ratingNorthern Ireland has its own separate rating system, operatedunder Northern Ireland legislation.      In general, the NorthernIreland system has been kept in line with that in England, but theNorthern Ireland Government are constitutionally free not tofollow our lead.     There are two- possible reasons for suggesting that they should be asked to follow suit on this occasion.      Thefirst is that industry has protested against re-rating in Englandand Wales., and if industry in Northern Ireland remained 75,-de-rated this might be used as an argument against re-rating inScotland, where the decision to re-rate has been announced but no date has been fixed.     Secondly, the revaluation of houses at current levels and the re-rating of industry can best bo done
together.      If house property in Northern Ireland is revalued at current values but industry is not re-rated, the opportunity tore-rate may be lost.     On the other hand, agreement to this pro-posal involves no positive action by the United Kingdom Government,and most of the other proposals are unacceptable.      The NorthernIreland Government would clearly dislike pressure to come into line with Great Britain.     We recommend that Northern ireland ministers should be informed that, while a decision to leave theirindustry de-rated could have very embarrassing reactions inGreat Britain, we recognise that this is a matter for them todecide.     They will doubtless consider the points mentioned above,and the needs of their own local government, which is called uponto undertake large public works.     If their final decision is tomaintain, at least for the present, the present level of industrialde-rating in Northern Ireland, we must ask them to announce this as solely their own decision, and to avoid saying or implying thatit has even the tacit acceptance of the United Kingdom Government.9.     Revival of pre-war loans guarantee lep;iolation of theNorthern Ireland parliament the ship-building industry throughout the United Kingdom issuffering from difficulties owing to lack of orders.     A specialSub-Committee of the Ship-building Advisory Committee is at presentconsidering the prospects of the United Kingdom industry as awhole.     The Chairman of this Sub-Committee is a permanent secretary of the Ministry of Transport, and its members are drawn from both sides of the industry as well as from Government Depart-ments.     The Trade Union representatives have boon assured that theposition ef Belfast will not be overlooked.     The Sub-Committeewill report its findings to the Ship-building Advisory committee as soon as it can.      It is not expected to propose anything on thelinos of the pre-war loans guarantee legislation.     However, theexport Credits Guarantee Department now exercises powers: underPostwar legislation to provide guarantees for the support of export trade throughout the United Kingdom.     The use of these-6-
powers to support the provision of long-term finance for ex-portfor the capital goods industries, including shipbuilding, isunder review at the present time.     The Department&apos;s presentfacilities and any extensions which may prove to be practicableshould, in effect, embrace the export aspects of the NorthernIreland proposal.Government policy on ship-building is mainly the responsibilityof the United Kingdom Government, and we think it should continueto bo dealt with on a United Kingdom basis.     We regard it as/of thequestion in present circumstances that special measures should betaken for Harland and Wolff alone, even in the form of NorthernIreland legislation.     There would inevitably be demands for similar measures in Great Britain, which could not reasonably be resisted.Forecasts in this field are difficult, but there are at present noreasons for supposing that Harland and Wolff will suffer a more severe or prolonged decline than United Kingdom shipyards generally,and on ship-building grounds alone there is no case for giving thisfirm specially favourable treatment, as the probable expense of itsBritish competitors.   What distinguishes Harland and Wolff is thefact that it is a very large firm in an area which already has a particularly acute unemployment problem, whereas the decline inemployment in other United Kingdom shipyards is more likely to beeffset by gains in other types of employment in the areas v^ifo^the yards are situated.     This is a reason for considering further measures to increase other types of employment in Northern Irelandrather than for singling out Harland and Wolff for speciallyfavourable treatment.-7-SECRET
10.   flffPital grantsThis proposal would involve a change in the law to breach theprinciple that for tax purposes a depreciation allowance is calcu-lated on the net cost to the industrialist of the capital asset inquestion.     If industrialists in Northern Ireland were allowed to claim tax allowances on industrial assets for which they themselveshad not paid there would be no alternative to making the same conces-sion to industrialists in Great Britain who receive capital grants under the Local Employment Act, 1960.     We therefore regard thisproposal as an inappropriate method for giving further financialassistance to Northern Ireland firms.     The Northern ireland government&apos;s memorandum does not mention that the legislation underwhich these grants are payable in Northern Ireland is due to expireshortly.     The question of its renewal is considered in Part III ofthis Report.11.   Income tax grantsArrangomnts of the type proposed have not found favour sincethe war because they are inherently unsatisfactory as incentivesfor industrial development in special areas.     They bring the greatesbenefit to firms which would dp well and make good profits.      firms in difficulties, and new firms which do not expect to make muchprofit to start with, would benefit very little or not at all.In short, the amount of income tax paid by a firm is not a good test of whether it deserves governmental assistance.     Moreover, unlessspecial arrangements were made, income tax grants of the naturesuggested would themselves be chargeable to income tax.     We donot recommend this proposal.&apos;2*    (a) The Queen linerHarland and Wolff will be among the shipyards invited to tender.Competition between the Clyde, the North East coast, the Merseyand Northern Ireland is likely to be very keen.     The job will go tothe yard which submits the best tender, and the Government could notdepart from this position in order to help Northern Ireland.- 8*-
Moreover, the keel of the ship is unlikely to be laid much beforethe end of 1962, and awarding the contract to Harland and Wolffwould accordingly do nothing to ease the firrn&apos;s immediate difficulties.(b) Admiralty ordersOrders for warships are now placed by competitive tender.Harland and Wolff are given opportunities to tender for suitablenaval work.     There is not now a great deal of work going in comparison with the available capacity of the shipbuilding industry as a whole.     There is also little overspill of repairing andrefitting work from the Royal Dockyards, which are maintained torefit the ships of the Royal Navy.      Consequently, the admiralty could do little to alleviate Harland and Wolffs problems even ifthe firm were outstandingly successful in competing for what workthere is.(c) A dry dockThe United Kingdom Government have consistently taken theview that financial support from the Government for such a projectcould be considered only if Harland and Wolff and the Belfast HarbourCommissioners vrerc to put forward a practicable scheme which they themselves were prepared to give considerable financial backing.So far, Harland and Wolff and the Harbour Commissioners have failedto do this.     There is no case for the,Government to considermeeting the entire capital cost of building a dry dock.     Wherethe Government has assisted the construction of dry docks inGroat Britain under local employment legislation, this assistancehas been confined to the loan of part of the capital cost, $ndLord Brookeborough has expressed doubts in the Northern ireland parliament whether this would be the best way to spend  hm.,    ifthis amount of Government capital were available for schemes to relieve unemployment in Northern Ireland.-9-SECRET
13.   Short and Harlands(a) The BelfastA firm order for ton Belfast freighter aircraft for the AirMinistry, valued at over  20m., was placed just before Christmas.The Air Ministry do not need more.     Whether the Belfast projectis successful will depend on how many, of the civil or militaryversions, can be sold to other customers.     The consensus of expertopinion is that the numbers will be small.(b) The S.O.I.This is a research aircraft, and none of the suggestions putforward by Shorts for applying its principle offers any immediate prospect of giving the firm substantial work in this field.There are many difficulties to overcome before an operational aircraft of this type could be developed.      In the immediate future the Company&apos;s work in this field will probably be confined tofurther research and support worlc.(c) The Sea CatShorts have a quite substantial order for the Sea Cat fromthe Admiralty, worth several million pounds..     They have alsorecently obtained a small order from Germany.     Much will dependon their ability to exploit the potential of this missile.(d) The future of ShortsIt must be admitted that this is uncertain. If economic considerations alone y\rere taken into account aircraft production at Shorts would almost certainly have to cease sooner or later aspart of the rationalisation of the aircraft industry.     But because -of the unemployment problem Shorts have hitherto been deliberatelyexcepted from the general policy of concentrating future government orders on the major aircraft groups, and the Ministry of Aviationwill continue to do what they can to see that the firm obtainssuitable aircraft and guided weapons work.      It is not yet clear to what extent the firm&apos;s long-term future could be safeguarded,with or without some form of association between Shorts and oneof the major aircraft groups, and any public assurances would haveto bo guarded.
111.   Sea transport costs the request for some form of investigation or supervision of sea freight rates, which, had originally been made by Lord Glentoranto the Minister of Transport in November, created a difficult problem, primarily because of the wider implications of such an investigation.     However, in the special circumstances, theMinister of Transport felt that he must comply with this requestas far as he reasonably could.     He has therefore now decided, inagreement with Lord Glentoran, to appoint a Committee to enquire into certain aspects of the shipping services between GreatBritain and Northern Ireland.     The terms of reference will beas follows:To consider the shipping services for both passengers and freight between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and to report whether they are satisfactory in the following respects:-(a) types and frequency of service;(b) standards of service;    and(c) reasonableness of charges.The membership of the Committee has not yet been settled.III.    conclusions the case for special treatment15.   Underlying most of the proposals by the Northern ireland government is the view that the circumstances of Northern Irelandare so exceptional that special measures should be taken to relieve unemployment there, going beyond anything that would be considered for the United Kingdom as a whole.      It has long been accepted that northern Ireland&apos;s situation does require some measure of special assistance.     But the degree of such assistance, the form itshould take, and the timing of the Introduction of new measures ofassistance, all require careful thought.     We do not consider thatany of the Northern Ireland Government&apos;s proposals would be suitableeven if it were accepted that new measures were required at thepresent time.-11-
16.   Northern Ireland already receives considerable financialadvantages from the rest of the United Kingdom.      Its treatment is in all respects at least as favourable as the treatment ofdevelopment areas in Great Dritain.     The grants to industrialistsare at a higher rate in Northern Ireland than in Great Britain.There is a.subsidy on industrial coal.    (There is also a grant of 1m. a year to compensate Northern Ireland farmers for theirremoteness from the British market.)      In addition, the result of treating the National Insurance schemes in Great Britain andNorthern Ireland as one is that so long as unemployment remains at a higher level in Northern Ireland, the British national insurance fund subsidises the Northern Ireland fund,    (At presentthe former is paying over 35m. annually to the latter.)     Andunder the Social Services (Northern Ireland Agreement) Act, 19-4-9,the United Kingdom Exchequer bears 80?i of any expenditure incurred by Northern Ireland above the proportion of 2^o of the total ofUnited Kingdom expenditure on certain other social services.(This proportion is judged to be Northern Ireland&apos;s share in maintaining her social services on the same level as the rest ofthe United Kingdom.     It is estimated that approximately  7.5 million will fall on the United Kingdom Exchequer in 1961/62).The financial arrangements between the United Kingdom and NorthernIreland Exchequers are such that the cost of these special measures, apart from the payments by the National Insurance Fund,falls ultimately on the United Kingdom Exchequer, even though theexpenditure is incurred in the first instance by the NorthernIreland Government.     The same would be true of any additional measures of assistance by the Northern Ireland Government.17.   The policy followed by United Kingdom Governments since thewar has fallen short of an all out attempt to solve the NorthernIreland unemployment problem but has aimed at containing unemploy-ment within tolerable limits.     Exceptional measures, such as those mentioned in the preceding paragraph, have been introduced at times when the rate of unemployment showed signs of rising above those-12-
limits.     ^he factors mentioned in paragraph 1 of this report are not temporary, and increased support for Northern Irelandmight well have to be maintained indefinitely if its effect wereto be permanent.      By the standards adopter1 up to now the presentsituation in Northern Ireland would not be regarded as warrantinga substantial permanent increase of support.     Even at its highestthe level of unemployment this winter is likely to remain belowthe level reached three years ago.18.   On the other hand, the rate of unemployment in England andWales, apart from a few small pockets, has remained tolerablefor some yearstt      In central Scotland it remains unsatisfactory,but is very much less than that in Northern Ireland as a whole.(Scotland has recently benefited from the expansion of the motor industry and the decision to build a new steel mill there;   nocomparable developments,-are possible in Northern Ireland).We vrould expect some areas of relatively high unemployment inGreat Britain which are more sensitive than others to complainif something special were done for Northern Ireland, but we donot think that this possibility should deter us from considering what could be done to relieve the situation in Northern Ireland.The case for this would be all the stronger if the contract forthe Queen liner went to the Clyde.     Even if it vrent to Belfast,Northern Ireland is likely to remain prominent as the one large area through the United Kingdom where the problem of high unemploy-ment is obstinate and persistent.19.   Any new measure at assistance to industry in Northern ireland is liable to create difficulties in Great Britain.     These difficul-ties would be greatest if action by the United Kingdom Governmentwere required, more particularly if United Kingdom legislation were necessary.     We should, therefore, be generally in favour ofany such assistance being given by the Northern Ireland government under their own powers.     Repercussions would be still furtherminimised if the new measure consisted of an extension of a typeof assistance already given, or at any rate if it conformed to a-13-
S EGRETprinciple already accepted.      Some quite new type of assistance should preferably be avoided.     We suggest that any study of possible new measures should be guided by these considerations.The possibility of introducing new jLong term measures20.   Iii the last paragraph of the introductory portion of their memorandum the Northern Ireland Government suggest that thereshould be a careful study of what farther long term measures couldbe introduced, designed to make a permanent improvement in thelevel of employment in Northern Ireland.     Northern ireland ministers may have had it in mind that an announcement of such a study as a joint project by the two Governments would demonstrate joint responsibility of the United Kingdom Government for theunemployment problem and would give some promise of future actionto offset the disappointment caused by the absence of importantimmediate measures.     On purely economic grounds we think that nothing would be gained from sucli a study.     The whole problem was exhaustively examined by a Joint Working Party of the twoGovernments which reported in 1952 and again in 1955.     Thesecomprehensive Reports demonstrated that Northern Ireland&apos;s permanenteconomic disadvantages are almost inevitably reflected in a relatively high rate of unemployment;    they are not reflected inlowering wages or in migration.     The tying of most Northern Irelandwage rates to those of Great Britain is an impediment both toreduction of wages and to migration to Groat Britain.     TheNorthern Ireland Government&apos;s own present memorandum,  and thisreport on it, underline the conclusion that there is no othersimple solution.     Yet another study could not be expected toproduce any different result.     The fact is that the industries,which are to be expanded in Scotland such as the steel and motorindustries, are plainly unsuitable for location in Northern Irelandand that the Northern Ireland Government&apos;s existing inducements arevery considerable, and already constitute a strong attraction to industries for which Northern Ireland is suitable.     If additional-1/4-
measures were to be really effectual,, they would have to be of atype, or on a scale, which the United Kingdom Government have notin recent years been prepared to contemplate.     For instance, nodoubt the direction of industry to Northern Ireland (with itscorollary of the direction of essential skilled labour), or apermanent subsidy of cross channel freight rates, could help toreduce the level of unemployment in Northern Ireland.     But such steps would represent a radical departure from present government policy, and would certainly lead to strong pressure for similarhelp to be given to Scotland, and other parts of Great Britain,apart from any other difficulties they would involve.21.   There is in any event no prospect of doing anything to relieve the immediate difficulties in Northern Ireland.     Eventhe adoption of all the Northern Ireland Government&apos;s own proposals would have little immediate result.     The Northern ireland government might well represent that they would face severepolitical difficulties if they had to admit this, and could atthe same time offer no hope of any future easement.     Suchjustification as there may be for a further study, in whateverform, of possible long term measures is thus political ratherthan economic.     If such a study were announced, even in the most&apos;general terms, this would do something to ease the immediatepolitical difficulties in Northern Ireland (and in the UnitedKingdom Parliament).      But it would do nothing to ease the current,economic difficulties., nor would it offer any hope for a long-termsolution unless extreme measures were to be adopted,,     The announce-ment would accordingly be likely to raise false hopes, and to cause embarrassment and disillusionment if in the event it boreno fruit.     If, moreover, it were announced as a joint projecthy the two Governments this would imply a more direct responsibility on the part of Her Majesty&apos;s Government for unemployment questions in Northern Ireland than United Kingdom Ministers have hitherto-15-
..............h^m^^m 126accepted.     On the other&quot; hand, an informal and confidentialexamination &quot;by the United Kingdom Departments concerned, inconsultation with Northern Ireland Departments, which would be announced only in the most general and non-committal terms, would avoid this difficulty, but at the expense of doing little to ease the political pressure on the Northern Ireland Government.Becommendations for the discussion .with jjorjbhjsrr^22.   We recommend that United Kingdom Ministers should take thefollowing line in these discussions(a) United Kingdom Ministers remain genuinely concerned to do what they can to help.     They cannot, however,accept that unemployment in Northern Ireland, as such,has now become a joint responsibility.     The UnitedKingdom Government are responsible for matters suchas financial controls, and policy on ship-building,but the extent to which they can help Northern ireland in these fields is limited by the nature of the problems involved and by the need to consider the interests ofthe United Kingdom as a whole,(b) Northern Ireland already receives an appreciabledegree of special treatment.     Any decision to increase its degree could only be taken after a careful study of the current circumstances and of possible means ofgiving further help. Her Majesty&apos;s Government agreethat such a study might be useful.(c) After careful study of the Northern Ireland Government&apos;sconcrete proposals Her Majesty&apos;s Government have comewith regret to the conclusion that most of them areunacceptable.     The reasons are explained in paragraphs7, and 9 - S^T, of this Report.U)    In these circumstances, while United Kingdom Ministersfully appreciate the feelings of Northern ireland ministers, they do not consider that the immediate introduction iof exceptional measures would be feasible.-16-SECRET
(c)   The United Kingdom Government leave the Northern Ireland Government todecide whether to re-rate industry.    Should they decide against doing jso, this decision should be announced as one taken by them alone, andthe announcement should not be linked with the discussions between thetwo Governments on measures to relieve unemployment.   The UnitedKingdom Government agree to the proposal, which was put forward bythe Northern Ireland Government independently of thei rmemorandum, that the legislation on the payment ofcapital grants to industry should be renewed for fiveyears from 1962. at an estimated cost of  16m.(f) United Kingdom Ministers are doubtful about the usefulness of any further studies of possible long-term measures, but if Northern Ireland Ministers should press for one, they consider that it should be conducted on an informal and confidential basis betweenthe two Governments.     Their agreement to such a studywould not commit them to accepting any proposals thatmight result from it though they would certainlyconsider^ sympathetically^, further measures of assistanceto Northern Ireland industry should feasible onesemerge:    including in this connection,  should thedifficulties of Harland and Wolff prove as great as theNorthern Ireland Government fear, measures for safe-guarding the workers there, so long as the applicationof such measures to this case would not render moredifficult resistance to their extension to other partsof the United Kingdom.(g) The announcement made by Northern Ireland Ministers of theresults of their discussion with United Kingdom ministers should be restricted to the agreement to the renewal ofthe legislation on capital grants and to a generalassurance of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments genuine resolve todo what they can to help.     Any ;joint study that may beagreed should not be announced;    the most that could besaid on this is that Her Majesty1s Government remainprepared, so far as they are concerned, to consider anyfurther practicable measures to relieve unemployment.-17-
PROPOSALS. BY NOR3HEBN IEEL&amp;HD GOVaiS3J3NTIn November, 1560, 33,200 persons (6.9% of the insured population) wereunemployed.   It is a measure of Northern Ireland &apos;s difficulties that this figure, high though it is, represents an improvement on any November since1956, hut a serious deterioration is in sight.    It is expected that about-3,000 shipyard workers will be declared redundant by the end of february and that the figure will have risen to 7,000 by mid-1961.   As a result,unemployment may rise to 9/2 in February and, in spite of the seasonalimprovement in spring and summer, remain in the region of 8%.Ever since the war, unemployment has remained consistently much abovethe average for the United Kingdom and even well above the level for development areas.The problem is therefore of a chronic nature requiring long-termremedies;   for practical purposes, this means an expansion of industry to absorb present unemployment and the creation of conditions under which   such employment will continue to expand in step with the increasing working population.   Schemes to produce employment of limited duration are necessary as a stop-gap and to deal with immediate crises, &quot;but they do little or nothing to solve the long-term problem.In 1952 and 1955 joint Working Parties of the United Kingdom andNorthern Ireland Governments considered this problem and as a result twopolicies were adopted;   as long-term measures schemes for encouragingcapital investment in industry were developed and a subsidy on industrialcoal yt&amp;s instituted.   In addition a Development Council was set up under lord Ghandos.   As a short and medium-term measure the Northern ireland government undertook a greatly increased programme of public works.Although these policies have undoubtedly helped to avoid even heavierunemployment they have clearly been inadequate to reduce the percentage toan acceptable level.   Moreover, the programme of public works cannot bemaintained indefinitely at its present level and the inevitable fall will increase unemployment, unless other forms of employment can be induced to expand in the meantime.The continuation of unemployment at a high rate in Northern Irelandwhen the United Kingdom as a whole has virtually enjoyed full employment for so many years, leads to severe political and social difficulties.   the disparity is thrown into sharper relief when restrictive measures designedto moderate excessive demand in the United Kingdom economy have the effectof adding to an already high rate of unemployment in Northern Ireland.   Incertain respects Northern Ireland has been excluded from restrictiveeconomic measures (for instance Northern Ireland banks are not required tomake special deposits) but, because of the close economic integration, mostof these measures are felt in full.    It is therefore all the more important,unless new methods of economic management are adopted with localisedeffects, to devise some means whereby the Northern Ireland economy can bemade strong enough to bear the adjustments which have to be introduced fromtime to time in the management of the United Kingdom economy as a whole.Much the same difficulties arise over long-term interest rates for local authority borrowing which are governed by market conditions in theUnited Kingdom generally.   As a result these rates have fluctuatedANNEX IIMEASURES FOR THE RELIEF OF UNEHPIDYLISNTin not^RN&quot;^iIeir7&quot;
considerably in recent years and experience has shown that this introducesan atmosphere of uncertainty in local authority plans which can only be detrimental to the achievement of a large and orderly housing programme.   Sosensitive is this programme in Northern Ireland to cost fluctuations,including fluctuations in interest rates, that in 1958 local authoritiesvirtually ceased placing new contracts and only resumed when, as a temporary measure, special additional subsidies were introduced.   It should be notedthat housing forms a very large part of the public sector investment whichwith the encouragement of the United Kingdom Government is being maintained at a high level as an aid to employment.All the major tools of economic management are in the hands of theUnited Kingdom Government and the financial arrangements with H.H. Treasuryrequire that almost any step taken by the Northern Ireland Government itself be taken in consultation with the United Kingdom Government.   The problem ofcuring Northern Ireland&apos;s unemployment is therefore a joint responsibilityof the two Governments.    It is therefore necessary that the proposals contained in this paper be considered as suggestions for discharging a joint responsibility.The chief way in which this responsibility can be discharged is by encouraging industry to locate plants in Northern Ireland.   Y/hile theNorthern Ireland Government must be ready with its inducements, responsibilityfor creating a situation in which firms are disposed to consider moving tothe area must rest largely with the United Kingdom Government.   The NorthernIreland Government therefore trusts that every influence will he brought tobear on suitable large-scale industries that might make them considerexpansion in Northern Ireland.If firms are to locate their new plants in Northern Ireland, it will benecessary to make it worth their while to do so.   Therefore, although the impending redundancy in the shipyards and the time needed for long-term measures to take effect make it necessary to put forward some short-termremedies, the Northern Ireland Government attaches most importance to long-term measures which will have the effect of raising employment permanentlyto a satisfactory level in comparison with the rest of the United Kingdom.The cost of sea transport between Northern Ireland and Great Britain,the virtual absence of any indigenous industrial raw materials or fuel andthe lack of a sizeable local market (further reduced by unemployment) con-stitute permanent handicaps to Northern Ireland&apos;s industry.   Moreover,inconvenience and delay add to the handicap of the water barrier.   Thesehandicaps cannot be removed, but they can be offset by cost advantages sothat it becomes as profitable to undertake industrial investment in NorthernIreland as in other parts of the United Kingdom.It appears to the Government of Northern Ireland that the time has now arrived when a careful study should be made of what further long-term measures could be introduced, designed to make a permanent improvement inthe level of employment in Northern Ireland.   Certain proposals are setforth in outline below but it is not intended that this list should in anyway be regarded as exclusive and the Government of Northern Ireland would welcome any proposals v/hich are put forward by British Ministers with theobject of helping the serious situation prevailing in the area.^0   Iteimbursemen^ of jfe^lovers1^ jfetional Insurance ContributionsIt is considered that to remit employers&apos; National Insurance contribution-ions offers the best hope of achieving the long-term result which is desired.The great advantage of this proposal is that it is directly related to employment and by reducing labour costs could provide a stimulus to allindustry in Northern Ireland.This proposal was first put forward in 1952 as one of the main
recommendations of the Working Group on employment policy in NorthernIreland.   As the members of that Committee pointed out, the proposal is anadaptation to the circumstances of Northern Ireland of a scheme mentioned inthe White Paper on Employment Policy of 1944- (Cmd. 6527) for reducingNational Insurance contributions in order to stimulate internal demand.    the adaptation consists of confining the remission to employers&apos; contributionsbecause to remit the employees&apos; share would have no direct value in stimul-ating employment.It is possible that the workers would regard the remission as a subsidy to employers which should be shared with the employees;   but almost a.nyscheme to assist industry must he directed at employers.    It would be an -essential feature of the remission that it was made at the expense of theExchequer so that the finances of the National Insurance Funds would not beaffected, apart from the resulting reduction in claims for unemploymentbenefit.The total *f employers&apos; contributions available for remission is about 94 million.   A scheme for complete remission would cost considerably lessas this figure includes about  Tg- million paid, either directly or indirectly,by the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland Governments.   A schemefor complete remission would thus cost about  8 million of which nearly halfwould return to the Exchequer as tax.2.   Industrial. De ratingIn the Rating and Valuation Bill, which is at present before parliament at Westminster, provision is made for the complete disappearance ofindustrial derating with effect from 1st April, 1963.When, in 1959, industrial derating in Great Britain was reduced from13% to 50fo, Northern Ireland did not follow suit on the grounds that economic conditions in Northern Ireland were very different and that itwould be inappropriate to throw an extra burden on local industry.    Thearguments for special treatment of new and existing industry are as strongtoday as they were in 1958.3.   Revival of pre-war Loans Guarantee legislationOne measure which would help the shipbuilding industry in its immediate difficulties is the revival of the pre-war L*ans Guarantee legislation.^This enabled funds to be borrowed, at a rate slightly below the commercialrate of interest, for the building of ships and other forms of capital equipment.   The Minister of Finance was empowered, subject to certain safe-guards, to guarantee interest and the repayment of principal on loans so longas the use of the loans in the manner proposed was calculated to increaseemployment in Northern Ireland.    The chief industry to benefit as ship-building .Difficulties in the shipbuilding industry are felt more acutely inNorthern Ireland because of the high level of general unemployment and the predominant position of the industry which affords about 21fo of the maleemployment in the manufacturing sector of the economy.^&quot;   (a) Capital GrantsConsideration has been given to ways in which the existing powers of theMinistry of Commerce to assist new industrial development can be made more attractive.    It would make a significant difference to the value of this assistance if firms in receipt of capital grants were allowed to claimdepreciation allowances on all their capital expenditure, and not, as at
5,    &apos; Snegn^, Linex^ Admiralty work. Dry DockConcern about unemployment is at present centered round the shipbuilding industry.    Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff have announced that by June of next year,7,000 workers will be laid off and this means that 1.5/S will be added to theNorthern Ireland unemployment rate - an increase almost equal to theexisting national average rate in Great Britain.In view of this serious situation Northern Ireland has a very strongclaim to the contract for the  &apos;Queen&apos; liner which is to be awarded with substantial Government assistance.   It is also desired to reiterate therequest made by Lord Brookeborough to Mr. Macmillan and Mr. Butler in his recent talks for more Admiralty work to be directed to the Belfast shipyardsin an effort to secure continued employment for the men to be paid off next spring.There has been considerable demand for a dry dock capable of taking thelargest ships afloat as a contribution towards the solution of the unemploy-ment problem in the shipbuilding industry.   Its cost is estimated to be inthe region of  4 million and it is almost certain that neither Messrs.Harland &amp; Wolff nor the Belfast Harbour Commissioners is willing to put upmore than a fraction of this capital.The construction of such a dock would provide short-term assistance byemploying 250-300 men for 2 or 3 years.   Once it was in operation it vrouldenable Messrs. Harland &amp; Wolff to undertake mare ship-repair work and sooffset to some extent the inevitable. reduction in employment on shipconstruction.The capital for such a dry dock will have to be found almost entirely by the Government.^&apos;   Messrs. Short Bros. &amp; ,HarlandIt is understood that the formalities for the signing of the contract for ten Britannic freighters are almost completed.    Continuity of employment,however, would be assured for a longer period if the United KingdomGovernment could increase its order from ten to twenty.It vrould also help to assure the future of the aircraft industry inNorthern Ireland if the S.C.1 vertical take-off project could be developed as rapidly as possible.    Some assurance that the Ministry of Aviation hasdefinite plans for this development and that it is their intention tomaintain Short Bros. &amp; Harland as a balanced production unit in NorthernIreland would help to allay the fears for the industry which have caused somuch public concern in Northern Ireland.The Northern Ireland House of Commons has called for an immediatepresent, only on the net amount after deduction of the grant.&apos;(*0 Income Tax GrantsBefore the war grants were offered in recoupment of income tax payable by new industries in their initial years.   This scheme has been replaced byassistance towards capital costs.   It is considered that some firms would find income tax grants more advantageous as an alternative to capital grantsif they could be given for a period of at least seven years.   If full advantage was to be gained from these grants it would, however, be necessaryfor them not to be regarded as taxable receipts.
