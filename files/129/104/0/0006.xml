SBUUl10//      f-&amp;K DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(61) 616th January, 1961COPY NO.CABINETCOST OF THE HEALTH SERVICEftMemorandum by the Minister of Pensionsand National insurance am glad that in their paper (C. (61) 1) the Chancellor of theExchequer and the other Ministers concerned recommend the exclusion of some of the larger families from the effect of the proposed reduction inthe subsidy on welfare milk.   But for the reasons indicated below we should]I suggest, consider whether the line of demarcation proposed is the rightone.2.     In debates on the adequacy or otherwise of social service benefitsfigures are often quoted from the tables published annually by the NationalFood Survey showing the nutrient content of the diet compared with scales of consumption recommended by the British Medical Association^Committee on Nutrition (1950).    These tables show that the average intake of three-child families, as well as of four-child families, is appreciablybelow the standard recommended by the British Mecical Association forprotein and calcium, and, although a recent report of the Survey has stated that these scales do not represent a precise evaluation of needs and allow a margin of safety, this is not widely known, and may not bevery helpful in defending the exclusion of three-child families. On the face of it these tables show that three-child families have a markedlylower standard of nutrition than those with only one or two children,and that their intake of protein and calcium is, according to the latest figures, slightly worse than in 1952.   The table in the Annex to this paperillustrates this.3.     It has to be remembered that, from the family allowance point ofview, we have for some time treated the three-child family as being among&quot;the larger families&quot;, the higher (10s.) rate of family allowance being introduced for the third and subsequent children in 1956 on this basis.The then Chancelloi of the Exchequer specifically announced it as being a measure of help for the large family, and the argument subsequentlyused in support of it was based on nutritional grounds.4.      The other class of family about whom I am concerned is that of thewidowed mother with young children,   She is generally regarded bystudents of social problems as being, as a class, one of the most hardlyhit sections of society.   The death of her husband has almost invariablyresulted in a sharp drop in the standard of life of herself and her family,and it is a matter of frequent comment that the children of a widow lack-1-
a good deal of what is available now to children of ordinary families.For this reason the    Cabinet    have agreed to successive and selectiveimprovements in the national insurance benefits payable to widowed mothers.   We have indeed taken some credit for the fact that the new rates of benefit which will be payable in April provide an increase of5s. in respect of each child of a widowed mother.   If the reduction in thesubsidy on welfare milk is applied to widowed mothers, they will loseon this account alone in respect of all children under five Is. 2d. of this5s. , quite apart from the erosion of the value of this improvement whichlooks like taking place as the result of rises in the cost of living.5.      It, therefore, falls for consideration whether, if we adopt thegenei si plan suggested in C.(6l) 1, the line of demarcation should not bedrawn so as to preserve the present rate of subsidy in respect of:-(a) Three-child families.(b) The families of widowed mothers - including  of course, inthis, war and industrial injury widows with young children.6.      I should perhaps mention that the linking of the higher rate of subsidy to families containing a certain number of children, as definedfor family allowance purposes, will produce certain anomalies, whichare likely to prove troublesome to defend and will be impracticabletorectify.   The introduction of the scheme by the beginning of June may,also, in the early stages involve my Department, as agent, not onlyin a certain roughness of administration but also in some relaxation of normal standards of financial control of entitlement to the benefit.   these difficulties I assume that Health Departments recognise and accept.7.      The anomalies mentioned in the proceeding paragraph are, howeversmall compared with what is, in my view, the major anomaly inherent in these proposals.   That is that we are proposing to reduce the subsidypayable on milk provided for children under five while continuing toprovide milk in schools free for young people up to the age of 18.J. A.
