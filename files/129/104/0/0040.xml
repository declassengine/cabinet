S.Commonwealth Relations Office,30th March, 1961.58780CONFIDENTIAL.....  ;::; CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY GE HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet. April 1961
TEXT OF TELEGRAM SENT ON 27th MARCH, 1961, TO high commissioners IN COMMONWEALTH COUNTRIESPersonal for High Commissioner from Commonwealth secretary in winding up the debate on 22nd March on South Africa&apos;s withdrawal fromthe Commonwealth, I said that &quot; whatever view we may take of the events of lastweek, I think that we must agree on one thing that the withdrawal of South Africawill have the effect not of dividing but of uniting more closely the nations of theCommonwealth &quot;.2. I went on to say that the role of the Commonwealth was not to build abloc of racially homogeneous nations but rather &quot; to build a bridge between peoples of all races and creeds &quot; and &quot; to provide a unifying influence in a deeply dividedworld &quot;.3. I concluded that &quot; having now come through the crisis, there is no doubtthat the unity and moral standing of the Commonwealth throughout the world willbe increased &quot;.4. South Africa&apos;s departure provides the psychological climate for a new step forward in Commonwealth co-operation. The removal of any doubt about theacceptance of the principle of multi-racialism should enhance the prestige of theCommonwealth in the world as well as its own solidarity. Commonwealth countriesmust take advantage of this opportunity to extend their collective influence.5. We must take the lead. British representatives throughout theCommonwealth must do everything possible further to strengthen Commonwealthlinks, to widen the scope of consultation, and to&apos; enlarge the area of common ground between the policies of Commonwealth countries.6. The agreed principles on disarmament which emerged from the PrimeMinisters&apos; Meeting show what can be achieved by vigorous and careful preparationfollowed by a full and constructive exchange of views.7. There are many major issues of both current and long-term importance on which the collective influence of the Commonwealth should be broughtincreasingly to bear. There are long-term problems such as disarmament and thefuture of the United Nations; there are immediate critical issues such as those ofLaos and the Congo. In the economic field there are questions of development andaid; problems of commercial policy arising from our relations with Europe. Thereare few international questions o.n which it will not be worth our while to strivehard and continuously to bring the policies of Commonwealth Governments into closer harmony.8. Of course a major object of this exercise is to secure Commonwealthsupport for British policy; it would be hypocritical to pretend otherwise. But inthe long view we shall be more likely to secure the support of the Commonwealthtor our policies, in matters that are important to us, to the extent that we takesympathetic account of and to the maximum possible extent shape our ownpolicies and action to meet the preoccupations of other Commonwealth countries on matters important to them.9.  While, therefore, we must develop even further our consultation with otherf^commonwealth countries, we must also do all we can to stimulate a two-way traffic,shall always be receptive to advice from you as to ways in which we can encourageother Governments to give us their confidence and to seek Commonwealthconsideration of their problems.10.  I do not under-estimate all that the Commonwealth Relations Office andposts abroad have done and are doing towards these objectives. But I look
to you and to members of your staff at all levels to make a major effort to seize the fresh opportunity which recent events have given us. It must be your task, as it willbe mine here, to search unremittingly for new ways of uniting the Commonwealthmore closely in every field and of giving a deeper and more practical significanceto collective consultation.11. i shall welcome your views as seen from your post on how you can bestachieve these ends and on what additional help we here can give you.March 1961.
