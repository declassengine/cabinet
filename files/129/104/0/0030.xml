Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1961C. (61) 30 Copy No.    5  3rd March, 1961CABINETSTATEMENT ON THE MALTA constitution memorandum by the Secretary of State for the ColontesI was invited to circulate a revised draft statement (C.C. (61) 10th Conclusions,Minute 5), which I do herewith. I wish to publish the Report of the BloodCommission and to make the statement in Parliament next week.2. I expect to be pressed hard in the House to say something about thenext stage of Malta&apos;s constitutional development and about her ultimate future.My first response would be on these lines:&quot; As I said when the Blood Commission was appointed, we are nowconcerned with the immediate future. I did not then and do not now suggestthat the constitution I have just announced will be the final stage in Malta&apos;constitutional development.&quot;If I am pressed further on the ultimate future of Malta, I would propose to say something on these lines:&quot; It is of course no part of Her Majesty&apos;s Governments policy to denyto the Maltese people the right to determine for themselves, at the appropriate time, their own destiny in association we hope with the United Kingdomand the Commonwealth family.&quot;I.

ANNEXMALTAStatement on Constitutional ChangesOn 27th July last year I informed the House of the appointment of a constitutional Commission to make recommendations for the restoration of elected government in Malta. The Commission^ Report is published to-day asCmnd. 1261.Sir Hilary Blood and his fellow commissioners, Mr. Edward St. John, Q.C.,and Mr. Fred Hayday, are to be congratulated on a most valuable report. TheGovernment are grateful to the Australian Commonwealth Government forrecommending Mr. St. John, who of course served in a personal capacity.Sir Alfred Roberts, until regrettably he had to retire through illness, was also avalued member of the Commission.Although the Malta Labour Party and the Malta Nationalist Party did not give evidence, the Commission were able to consult a wide range of Maltesepersonalities and interests of all political complexions.The Government have decided to accept the Commission^ constitutionalrecommendations as the basis for the next Maltese constitution. The drafting of constitutional instruments will now be put in hand. I hope that it may bepossible to hold elections before the end of the year.The broad effect of the Commission^ recommendations is that the MalteseParliament and Government will be responsible for domestic matters including,with the reservation I mention later, internal security. In addition and this isan innovation going much beyond the 1947 constitution the Maltese Governmentwill be given concurrent powers in the field of defence and by specific delegation,in that of external affairs. Because of our ultimate responsibility for defence and external affairs, Her Majesty&apos;s Government will also retain powers in these twofields, Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ view prevailing in the event of conflict. Thisarrangement, given reasonable co-operation between the two parties, should enabledifferences over defence and foreign affairs to be kept to a minimum. the consultative machinery recommended by the Commission will ensure that decisions in these fields are based on adequate information and discussion and, itis hoped, help to prevent disagreements arising or, if they arise, facilitate theirsettlement. This is a break with the long tradition of diarchy in Malta, which theCommission are convinced is no longer practicable.United Kingdom responsibilities for defence and external affairs in Maltawill be in the hands of a United Kingdom Commissioner. The Governor willbecome virtually a constitutional Head of State.In view of the important step forward that these changes constitute, theCommission recommend that the Islands should in future be known as the Stateof Malta.The Commission make it clear that the record of past political interferencewith the police and the necessity to exclude political and other undesirableinfluences compel them to recommend that the Commissioner of Police, in whomthe day-to-day responsibility for the administration and operation of the Force is vested, should for the time being be ultimately responsible to the Governor. her majesty&apos;s Government accept this recommendation.Her Majesty&apos;s Government have noted the view of the Commission, inparagraph 120 of their Report, that they did not find themselves hampered in anyWaY by their terms of reference. The Commission say that however wide these terms might have been they could not envisage Malta progressing, at the presenttune and in existing circumstances, to a more advanced stage along the path of constitutional progress.
The constitution proposed by the Commission, of which I have given a verybrief outline will enable Malta to enjoy once more a very substantial degree ofself-government. Our aim is to establish, as the Commission puts it, a partnership between Malta and the United Kingdom. This partnership will work only if bothoartners want it to work and are ready to co-operate with each other in ensuring that it does work. I offer Her Majesty&apos;s Government s full co-operation and i know the House will join me in the sincere hope that the same co-operation will be forthcoming from the duly-elected Maltese leaders. Her Ma]esty&apos;s government believe that given the necessary degree of mutual confidence between the twopartners the constitution proposed by the Blood Commission provides the best way in which elected government and self-government can be restored in Malta.March, 1961.
