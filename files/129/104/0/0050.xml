OCUM ENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 50 COPY NO. J^JLUth April. 1961CABINETTRAWLSjR^ STRIKE AT HULL AND GRIMSBYMemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the strike by the skippers, mates and engineers of the fishingtrawlers at Grimsby and Hull is most regrettable.   Three unions have been involved.   They are the Hull Trawler Officers&apos; Guild  and the GrimsbyTrawler Officers&apos; Guild, both of them independent unions, and the GrimsbyEngineers &amp; Firemen&apos;s Union which is affiliated to the Trades Union Congress(T.U. C. ).2. The stride has been primarily directed against the landing ofIcelandic fish in Grimsby and in Hull.   The skippers and engineers feelthat the recent settlement of the fishing dispute with Iceland was unreasonablyharsh and unfair to this country.   In particular, Grimsby skippers resentbeing deprived immediately of the specialist plaice fishery within 12 miles off the north-west coast, a fishery which has been of special importanceto them.   They consider, therefore, that as a quid pro quo for our trawlersbeing debarred from fishing in so many areas round the Icelandic coast,Icelandic trawlers should be debarred from landing their fish in thiscountry, more particularly as they are able to fish in areas round the icelandic coast where British trawlers are prevented from fishing.3. Landings of Icelandic fish are governed by the Paris Agreementof 1956 between the trawling industries of the United Kingdom and of iceland.   The Agreement provides for the landing of Icelandic fish up tothe value of  450, 000 per quarter.   It continues for a period of tan years,-i-iefore concluding the recent settlement Iceland asked for confirmationthat the terms of this Agreement would continue to be honoured.   TheBritish trawler owners gave this assurance which was passed on to Iceland.At present the British trawler owners are firm in their determination to honour their agreement.4, The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (T. &amp; G. W. U. ) whichis responsible for the crews of the trawlers and for the landing labour at Grimsby is also officially opposed to the strike although many of thelocal members have shown sympathy with the stand taken by the skippersand engineers.   The T. k G. VV. U. is confident that it will be able to keepthe loyalty of its men and will do everything to prevent the strike spreading.The T. U. C. has also written to the Engineers&apos; Union at Grimsby drawing attention to the fact that the Union is acting contrary to official policy.CtBCUlOTSP........*tjJ&amp;.....ai....Lj *248-1-CONFIDENTIAL
5. The strike has affected middle and near water trawlers aswell as distant water trawlers.   An agreed settlement of the strike hasbeen reached at Hull on the basis that there will be discussions on out-standing points between the two sides.   Meanwhile ships at sea fromGrimsby are completing their trips and are only being asked to join thestrike on their return.   This means that supplies will still be coming into the port over the next two weeks.   In addition, fish will be available from other ports such at Fleetwood and Aberdeen which have not been affected.   This, together with foreign landings, imports, and stocks offrozen fish, should suffice to maintain supplies over the next two or threeweeks, without prices rising too high.   After that, however, there maybe some scarcity with a corresponding rise in price.6. This is an industrial dispute between the skippers and engineers,on the one hand and the owners on the other.   Although the primary purposeof the strike is to prevent Icelandic landings, there is a number of othermatters in dispute between the two sides, including the question of wages.These matters are bound to be brought in to any proposals for asettlement.7. It is clear that there can be no question of going back on thesettlement of the fishing dispute made with Iceland.   It is equally clearthat we should encourage the owners to stand firm in honouring the paris Agreement of 1956, since if they break this Agreement Icelandmay feel that she is entitled to go back on the settlement over the fishery limits.   In these circumstances it would seem as though the strike canonly be terminated if the Grimsby skippers and engineers give way ontheir demand that an assurance should be given that no more Icelandicfish should be landed in this country.   They are certainly not in the moodto give way on this point at present, and the strike therefore will probably have to take its course before there  is any prospect of a settlement.8. I do not think that it would be desirable, or indeed that any useful purpose would be served, by the Government attempting to interveneat this stage.   In a week or so it is possible that there may be anopportunity for some conciliation move.   In the meantime we can I thinkonly keep in close touch with developments, which I will reports to mycolleagues as necessary.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S. W. 1.10th April, 1961-2-
