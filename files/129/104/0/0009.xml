1*4-)&apos;\i\      S&apos;:^J35THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTNUCLEAR DISARMAMENT-REFUSAL TO PAY TAXMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerA number of individuals, a few of them quite well-known in the literary andartistic worlds, have signed a declaration of their intention to refuse to pay a quarterof the income tax or surtax which they were due to pay on .1st January the quarterrepresenting what they regard as Government expenditure on nuclear weapons.2. The collection of tax is a statutory responsibility of the Board of InlandRevenue and I do not intervene in the handling of individual cases, though I havea general power to give directions to the Board. Nevertheless I thought it would be useful to let my colleagues know of the way in which the Board propose to handle the matter as the steps taken to collect the tax may in due course attract a certainamount of publicity.3. The Board propose to handle any failure to pay a proportion of the tax justlike other cases of non-payment. They will not accelerate any of the steps on theother hand they will try to avoid any delay. A second demand note asking for payment within 10 days will be sent in the ordinary course shortly after21st January. A final notice will be sent shortly after 15th February. This gives the taxpayer a further seven days to pay and warns him that recovery proceedingswill be taken failing payment.4. If these taxpayers remain recalcitrant the Collector can distrain on the taxpayer^ goods, having first made a personal call and endeavoured to induce himto pay. There is an alternative procedure, for amounts up to  50, of summaryproceedings in the local Magistrates&apos; Court; for larger amounts proceedings can betaken in the High Court. The Board will have to consider, when the time comes,which of these steps seems to be appropriate in the individual cases.5. So far Collectors have reported five taxpayers (including three signatories of the declaration) who have refused on political grounds to pay a proportion ofthe tax due.Printed for the Cabinet.
