&apos; Printed for the Cabinet.  February 1961C. (61) 20 Copy No.   328th February, 1961CABINETCAPITAL punishment memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department i am under considerable pressure to do something about capital punishment,and I should like the approval of my colleagues for the line I propose to take.2. On the general question of the present state of the law, a number of ourown supporters want me to restore the death penalty for all murders, and I think there is a considerable section of public opinion which supports this proposal. Itis argued that the murder rate has risen, that many of the murders which arousethe strongest feelings (in particular, sex murders) are not capital, and that thepresent distinction between capital and non-capital murder can no longer be defended. The abolitionists, on the other hand, while agreeing that the present law is anomalous and indefensible, argue, as they have always done, that there isno evidence that the death penalty has a uniquely deterrent effect, and that theonly thing to do is to abolish it altogether.3. If a change in the present law were to be made, these seem to me to bethe alternatives to restore the death penalty for all persons convicted of murder,or to abolish it altogether. I do not think that it would be practicable or desirableto try to modify the present categories of murder for which the death penalty is available.4. Apart from this general issue, we have an official Opposition amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill, proposing to raise the minimum age for the death penalty from eighteen to twenty-one. This amendment I propose to resist, onthe ground that it is undesirable to amend the law of murder in a particular respect,and that consideration of it as a whole is not relevant to the Criminal Justice Bill,which is concerned only with offenders under the age of twenty-one.5. On the more general question, I should, on the whole, propose to leavethe law unchanged for the time being. The settlement of 1957 was designed tokeep the death penalty for those crimes the murder of a police or prison officer,murder by shooting, and murder in the course or furtherance of theft which were thought to be most prejudicial to law and order. It has been in operation for only four years. It has always been in view that it should have a five, years&apos; runbefore we attempted to reassess it. I think this is right. But there are twodifficulties which we have to keep in mind. The more we imply that we intend to review the law in the relatively near future, the more we are bound to give theimpression that we shall then change it one way or the other. The second is thatthe longer we shelve the issue especially if there were to be any sort of inquiry -gg. fne nearer we get to an election; and we do not want this to become an electionW issue. In spite of these dangers, however, / am disposed to think the right course is to play the matter long. At the moment, an abolition Bill certainly would not commend itself to the majority of our supporters, or, I think, to public opinion;and a Bill restoring the death penalty for murders which are not now capital wouldbe opposed by a strong minority of our own people, as well as by the Opposition.58487THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
6. I ought also to take the opportunity of mentioning the case of TimothyJohn Evans, about which I have undertaken to make a statement. As a result ofthe recent publication of Mr. Ludovic Kennedy&apos;s book, &quot; 10, RillingtonPlace&quot;, it is again being suggested that Evans was wrongly convicted ofthe murder of his child; and that either he should posthumously be given a free Pardon or there should, at any rate, be a fresh inquiry. The case wasthe subject of an inquiry in 1953, after Christie had been convicted. its conclusion, which Mr. Kennedy does not accept and which a number of Membersof &quot;Parliament and others have never accepted, was that Evans was undoubtedlyguilty of killing his wife and child. My examination of the book in relation to all available information about the case is not yet complete, but, unless it is foundthat any new and relevant facts have been brought to light and this seemsimprobable my conclusion is likely to be that, whether Evans was guilty or not,it cannot now be established that he was innocent of the murder of the child. if so, there could be no question of giving him a Free Pardon; and, I suggest, no pointin having a further inquiry. The evidence in the case, so far as witnesses survive,is now not only old, but probably influenced by the arguments which have been going on for the last 12 years.7. Finally, Mr. Sydney Silverman, M.P., has had on the Order Paper for sometime a Motion criticising my decision to let the law take its course in the recentcases of Harris and Forsyth Forsyth being only eighteen years of age. I haveavoided a debate on this Motion so far. I expect, however, that there will be renewed pressure because of the current interest in the case of George Riley, whereit is being argued that, as his conviction depended upon his own admission, thereare analogies with the Evans case which raise an element of doubt. I must thereforeexpect increasing criticism of my decisions in individual cases, and increasingParliamentary pressure for debates about them. I shall resist such discussion asfar as I can. If it takes place, I can only maintain, as my predecessors, includingH. Ff. Asquith, have done, that I take account of all the circumstances of each case,and all the information available to me about it from any sources, before coming to what I believe to be the right decision.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,9th February, 1961.
