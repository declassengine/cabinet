J1DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT) li^lLlT COPY NO.9ch February, 1961CABINETAIRCRAFT MOVEMENTS BETWEENGIBRALTAR AND SPAINMemorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Foreign AffairsThe United States Government have consulted me about thismatter.2.        I understand from the Secretary of State for Air that inAugust, 1959 the Royal Air Force authorities in Gibraltar approached the United States Air Force authorities in Spain on a technical level and suggested, subject to government approval, that information on aircraftmovements should be exchanged between Gibraltar and neighbouringUnited States and Spanish air defence organisations.   Under such anarrangement: -(a) Information on hostile air activity v/ould be passed from theSpanish Air Defence Organisation to Gibraltar so that the most effectivepracticable defence measures could be taken there;(b) Information on friendly aircraft using or overflying Gibraltarwould be passed by the R. A. F. to the Spanish/United States Air defence organisation.   This would avoid wasteful air defence activity and risk to friendly aircraft.3.        At present it would be possible for information on hostile air activity to be passed by the Spaniards to Gibraltar indire ctly throughthe channel of the United States Air Force, thus avoiding any contact betweeijthe Spanish organisation and our own in Gibraltar.   Such an arrangementis, however, prejudiced  by the decision to integrate the Spanish and united States air defence systems in Spain.   The United States Governmenthave agreed to the proposed exchange but have pointed out that the integration will mean that we will have to deal with the Spaniards direct.They have suggested that British representatives should approach theSpanish authorities and that no information about this arrangement shouldbe volunteered to the North Atlantic Alliance unless questions are askedthere.   The United States Government also hope that we will agree thatBritish military aircraft notified under these arrangements could be usedfor practice interception by aircraft of the United States or Spanishdefence authorities and I understand that this is acceptable to the AirMinistry.    This is not, however, an essential part of the proposed agreement.-1-SECRET
4.        I have consulted Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Madrid and $heUnited Kingdom Delegation to the North Atlantic Alliance.    The governor of Gibraltar has also been consulted,      They agree to the proposal,provided it is kept at a technical rather than at a political level, the -governor making the additional point that the Spaniards should not beallowed to gain control of the air space over Gibraltar.   There is no signthat this is a Spanish motive at present.   The technical nature of thearrangement will be safeguarded by making the approach to the Spaniardsthrough Air Force channels locally from Gibraltar (i.e. nothing need besaid in Madrid),5.        I recognise that, since the A. O. C. Gibraltar has North atlantic alliance as well as national responsibilities and his aircraft would,in an emergency, be assigned to the Alliance, this proposal involvesan indirect link between Spain and the Alliance.   But the link is tenuousand there are good practical reasons for going ahead, including theneed to ensure air safety.   Even if the arrangements became knownpublicly, I do not think we need be afraid of criticism.6.        I hope, therefore, my colleagues will agree that I shouldrespond favourably to the United States approach and that the A. O. C.Gibraltar should accordingly be instructed to renew discussion at thetechnical level with the United States Air Force in Spain and to approach the local Spanish Air Force authorities.H.Foreign Office, S. W . 1.8th February, 1961-2-
