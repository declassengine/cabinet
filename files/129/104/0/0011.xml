(61) 11 Copy No.    323rd February, 1961CABINETA DEPARTMENT OF TECHNICAL CO-operation memorandum by the Prime minister in our Election Manifesto, under the heading &quot; Our Duty Overseas &quot;, we said :&quot; We emphasise the part that individual service can play. The needfor teachers, doctors and technicians of every kind is almost unlimited, andan appeal to the adventurous spirit of youth must be made. We shallencourage the professions and industry to help those willing to do so toserve for a few years in the overseas Commonwealth without prejudice to theircareers at home.&quot;2. During the last 12 months the Ministerial Committee on Individual service overseas, under the Chairmanship of the Paymaster-General, has been examiningthis problem. The very useful work which they have done has drawn attentionto the large number of agencies in this country, both within the Government and outside it, which are concerned in one way or another with recruiting people for service in posts abroad. It has also demonstrated the need for an executive agencywhich can provide a central focus and impetus for all this effort, which forms alarge part of our technical assistance to countries overseas. As time goes onthere will be an increasing need to ensure that the resources we can make availablefor this purpose are mobilised and deployed to the best advantage. In view ofour limited resources of capital we shall have increasingly to rely on the supplyof experts and advisers and on our capacity for providing training facilities as a means of preserving our influence in the newly independent countries, particularly those of the Commonwealth.CONFIDENTIAL58443
2CONFIDENTIAL3. The Colonial Secretary informed the House of Commons on 19th december that the Government had put in hand a study of the possibility of setting up a new department to co-ordinate the provision of technical assistance to countires overseas. This study has now been completed. I have discussed its results withthe Ministers most directly concerned, and we are agreed that we should proceedwith the establishment of a new Department for this purpose. ^4. The new Department would be known as &quot; The Department of technical co-operation &quot;. It would be in charge of a Minister, with the status of a Ministerof State, who would be called the Secretary for Technical Co-operation. legislation would be required to establish the Department; and it should be possible for this tobe passed through Parliament in time for the Department to come into operation on1st July, 1961.5. The Department, if it is established, will take over the existing functions ofthe Foreign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office and Colonial Office relatingto technical assistance in the wider sense, i.e., not only the provision of experts and advisers and the supply of training equipment, but also all the work in the educational field, e.g., in the training of students, the provision of teachers, &amp;c. Itwill account for its expenditure on its own Vote.6. The Secretary for Technical Co-operation will be responsible for initiatingproposals for technical assistance within the limits of policy laid down by the secretaries of State in charge of the three Oversea Departments, and for directinghis Departments executive and co-ordinating functions.7. Subject to the agreement of my colleagues I propose in the course of thenext few days to make a short statement announcing the Governments decision toset up this new Department. In order to allay any anxieties which other commonwealth Governments might have about this change in our domesticmachinery for handling this aspect of our relations with them, I propose to give amore detailed explanation of the functions of the new Department at the Meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers in March. The Bill could then be introducedtowards the end of March and its Second Reading could be taken soon after the easter recess. This would enable the new Department to come into operation on1st July.H.
