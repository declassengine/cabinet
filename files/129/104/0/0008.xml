^ 4&apos;      32DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 8 COPY NO.     S^-2Cth January, 1961CABINETWELFARE MILKMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have been thinking further about welfare milk in the light of thediscussion at our last meeting (C. C. (61) 1st Conclusions, Minute 4).2.      We were all concerned about the agricultural implications.   I havenot been able to consult the Minister of Agriculture before circulating this paper, but I understand that the agreed estimate of the fall in consumption inthe original proposal by the Health Ministers was 15-20 million gallons.(The total sales of milk in 1960-61 are estimated at 2,314 million gallons, ofwhich 1,560 million are for liquid consumption).3.      This proposal was then modified to exclude the 4-child families,which was expected to reduce the saving in a full year from  11. 5 millions to  9-3 millions:  the proposal of the Minister of Pensions to exclude the3-child family would reduce the saving by a further  2. 2 millions to 7.1 millions.   These modifications would improve consumption disproportionate-tionately - for it was in the large families that a fall in consumption was expected in the original plan.   If the 4-child family is excluded, I do not see how one can expect a fall in consumption of very much more than 10 million gallons (and less again if the 3-child family is excluded).4.      Even if there were a fall, it could not, as I understand it, affectfarmers1 incomes in 1961-62, for the standard quantity on which the guaranteesare based is already fixed.   This year, the loss if any (and a loss on10 million gallons represents  Oc75 millions) would be borne either by theExchequer or by the consumer (if prices were put up by ^d. a pint for lessthan a fortnight, this wouldoffset the loss on 10 million gallons).5.     For 1962-63 and afterwards, whether the farmers lost, would depend upon the 1962 Price Review.   By then we should know whether the subsidycut had reduced consumption.   It would seem to me quite reasonable, if theAgricultural Ministers are seriously concerned about the danger of a fallin consumption, to assure the farmers that if the subsidy cut did lead to ademonstrable fall this fact would be taken into account in fixing the guaranteedquantities in the 1962 Price  Review.6.     With regard to drawing the line at the 4-child family) in the view ofthe Minister of Health, this is the right point nutritionally.   Nor do I thinkthat this action on welfare milk would carry any implication either way for school milk.   Aj.jKarantly the medical and nutritional considerations becomequite different after the age of five.   Moreover, if the welfare milk subsidyis cut as proposed, it will still be equivalent to giving an under-5 childi pint free daily, or if pints a week:  free school milk is if pints per childa week, so no anomaly would be created.   If we do the welfare milk cut, wecan consider any proposals that the Education Ministers may bring forward.on their own merits.-1-
7.     In short, I would stick to the proposal in C.(6l) 1.3. L.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.-20th January, 1961-2-SECRET
