244Lma.6 it this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTKUWAIT: FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED KINGDOMThe relationship between the United Kingdom and Kuwait is based on the&quot; Exclusive Agreement &quot; of 1899, under which the Ruler of Kuwait undertook, onbehalf of himself and his successors, not to alienate territory or to receive foreign representatives without previous British consent. I attach as Annex A the text ofthis agreement. The agreement does not itself establish that Kuwait is under british protection. This was first stated in a letter from the Political Resident inthe Persian Gulf to the Ruler of Kuwait dated 3rd November, 1914 (Annex B),i.e., at the outbreak of the 1914-18 war; it conveyed the recognition of the BritishGovernment that the Shaikhdom of Kuwait was an independent Government under british protection; it was reaffirmed in an unpublished letter of 21st October, 1958(Annex C), from the Political Agent in Kuwait to the Ruler, which stated that weshould &quot; continue to be ready, as in the past, to provide any support which may benecessary in connexion with Kuwait&apos;s relations with o^ier countries &quot;. It was stated in Parliament on 4th February, 1959, that the Sheikhdom of Kuwait is anindependent State which Her Majesty&apos;s Government are under an obligation toprotect.2. After discussion in the Cabinet in November 1958 (C.C. (58) 80thConclusions, Minute 7), a public statement was made in March 1960 to the effectthat Kuwait was fully responsible for the conduct of her international relations.This fact makes the Agreement of 1899 out of date. Accordingly, the formerForeign Secretary suggested in May 1960 that, if the question of revising the exclusive Agreement was raised by the Ruler; the Political Resident in the persian gulf or the Political Agent in Kuwait should be empowered to reply, as from himself, that he was sure that Her Majesty&apos;s Government would be ready toconsider doing so (C. (60) 81). The Cabinet decided, however, that the british authorities in the Gulf should not go further than simply to undertake to refer thequestion to Her Majesty&apos;s Government for consideration (C.C. (60) 31stConclusions, Minute 7).3. The Ruler of Kuwait has now raised this question. He told the political resident on 4th January that he considers that circumstances have undergone a fundamental change since the signature of the 1899 Agreement, that nothing nowremains valid in the latter except the strong ties of friendship which join the twocountries, and that he now wishes to make an agreement with Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment which while replacing the Agreement of 1899 would affirm thisfriendship and Britain&apos;s readiness to assist Kuwait. The Ruler is anxious to do this before the present Political Resident leaves the Gulf early in May.4. In considering this request I suggest that the following factors should betaken into account:(a) The 1899 Agreement is incompatible with kuwait&apos;s responsibilities for herinternational affairs, and we therefore have no grounds for opposing the view of the Ruler that it is out of date and should be replaced.Printed for the Cabinet.   April 1961C. (61) 496th April, 1961Copy No.   32CABINETMemorandum by the Lord Privy Seal58786B
(b) Access to Kuwait&apos;s oil resources on the best financial terms possible remainvital interests for the United Kingdom and these would be endangeredshould Kuwait lose her independence. It therefore remains in theinterest of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to continue to afford assistanceto Kuwait in maintaining its independence. It is clear that, as theinternational personality of Kuwait grows, she will wish in various waysto show that she is no longer dependent upon us, but we must continueto use the opportunities which our protective role will afford to ensureso far as we can that Kuwait does not materially upset the existing financial arrangements or cease to be a good holder of sterling.(c) A new agreement between the United Kingdom and Kuwait which stated the obligation of Her Majesty&apos;s Government to assist Kuwait in maintaining her independence would be liable to invite attack both on her Majesty&apos;s Government for imposing, and on the Ruler of Kuwaitfor accepting, what would be represented as an imperialist relationship,out of line with developments elsewhere in the modern world. this might increase Arab nationalist pressures upon and within Kuwait to renounce British protection or at least to make Kuwait less helpful tous in their oil and financial policy. It would also be liable to increasepopular pressures in Kuwait for a change of the regime, which evenif not immediately effective might become increasingly troublesome and increase the difficulty of defending Kuwait if a situation ever arosewhen we had to take military action.(d) There would therefore be advantage both for Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentand for the Ruler of Kuwait if any new agreement to replace that of1899 presented as little target as possible for the attacks referred toin (c). I would expect that the Ruler would see this matter in the samelight but on this I cannot be sure before we have discussed the question with him further.5. On the assumption that we agree to terminate the 1899 Agreement, andthat the Ruler will insist on some reassurance that its termination does not imply any diminution in our obligation to protect Kuwait, as set out in the publishedletter of 3rd November, 1914, and the unpublished letter of 21st October, 1958, bothdescribed in paragraph 1 above, there seem to be three possible forms of instrumentwhich we might discuss with him. Each of these forms would involve the creationof a binding international agreement whch would have to be registered with theUnited Nations. I have put them in what I think to be the descending order ofmerit, in the light particularly of the consideration at paragraph 4 (d) above:(a) An Exchange of Notes between the Political Resident and the Ruler of Kuwait, which would simply abrogate the 1899 Agreement,accompanied by an oral assurance that Her Majesty&apos;s government recognised their continuing obligation to assist in the maintenance ofthe independence of Kuwait. The Exchange of Notes would bepublished and registered with the United Nations, but the oralassurance, which could be recorded in an aide memoire, would not befor publication or registration. If, on the conclusion of this exchange,the Government were asked, for example in the House of Commons,whether it affected our existing obligation, we should have to say thatit did not.(b) An Exchange of Notes which would both abrogate the 1899 agreement and state that its abrogation did not affect our continuing obligationto assist in maintaining the independence of Kuwait. In consideringthe draft of these our aim would be to make clear that we were simplycontinuing an existing obligation. No time-limit to the latter would need to be stated, and, as at present, our obligations would continue indefinitely.(c) A treaty, containing, apart from formal clauses, exactly the same obligations and having the same legal effect as (b) above, but made subject to ratification. It would be normal for an agreement dealing with mattersof defence to be subject to ratification, and a formal treaty would bethe appropriate form for an agreement with ratification provisions.The disadvantage would be that it would no doubt be debated in theHouse of Commons and questions might have to be answered aboutthe exact nature of our obligations as a protecting Power which, in
Foreign Office, S.W. 1,5 th April, 1961.58786the evolving State of Kuwait, it would be best to leave vague, and the answers to which would probably increase the scope of attacks byother Arab countries, who would almost certainly endeavour torepresent the treaty as creating new obligations on Kuwait. The moredifficult questions would be concerned with our obligations in theevent of subversion in Kuwait which might or might not involve an armed attack or be accompanied by threats from other neighbouringPowers.6. It would be possible to offer to the Ruler to supplement whicheveralternative is chosen by the negotiation of a treaty of friendship and commercebetween the United Kingdom and Kuwait, thus emphasising the full independence of the latter. This would, however, entail the consideration of a number ofcomplex technical issues which would take a considerable time and could not bedone within the period which the Ruler has in mind. It is not, therefore, a substitute for an agreement abrogating that of 1899 and I do not think that weshould suggest to the Ruler that the abrogation should be postponed until a treatyof friendship and commerce can be worked out.recommendations. (a) We should accept the Ruler&apos;s wish to terminate the ExclusiveAgreement of 1899 by means of a new agreement.(b) Instructions should be sent to the Political Resident to inform the Rulerof this and to work for the solution proposed in paragraph 5 (a). Theyare meeting on 15th April, 1961.(c) If the Ruler insists that the agreement must contain a reaffirmation ofHer Majesty&apos;s Government^ obligation to assist in the maintenance ofthe independence of Kuwait, I should have authority to follow up the alternatives set out in paragraph 5 (b) and (c), with a preference forthat of (b), and for keeping the eventual instrument simple and containing as little as possible to invite attack from other arab countries. I would consult the Cabinet again when it is clear whatkind of agreement it will be possible to conclude and before a final text is adopted.(d) The Political Resident should also be instructed to ask the Ruler whether he wishes to negotiate a treaty of friendship and commerce with thiscountry.E.
