I 147t)0CUM3NT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)0,1611336th March, 1961COPY NO. v3)2-CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Mihister of.Agriculture,Fisheries jynd food we have a chance o  getting an agreed Preview and milk is the key to it.Leaving milk aside, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Farm price review Committee agreed that I should offer a figure between t 6 millions and +S.7 millions.   This is in the context of farm costs having risen by 19 millions (of which the lion&apos;s share is the wage award of last year), and ofthe worst autumn weather in years, with its effect on next season1 s crops.2.   The present position of horse trading is that I have offered+E4 millions, so I still have some in hand;   and Mr. &quot;Woolley, President ofthe National Farmers&apos; Union, who sta.rted at +&amp;15 millions, has come downto +JL10 millions, and he still has some to offer up.    So thore is a goodcha.nce of agreement.3.     Eut this leaves out the problem of milk, which is notoriously themost difficult and the most sensitive, as it touches so many farmers.4.      The price determination for milk is made up of two factors.     Thefirst is arrived at by an established formula, based on the amount of liquid milk sold in the previous year.     Under this formula., the price per gallonfor next year is to be raised by a ^d.     This is agreed, and there is noargument between us and the farmers over it.     The other and principalfactor is the guaranteed price.     The farmers have put in for an increaseof 4d. a gallon.    They have strong arguments for this on the limited basisof the low profitability of milk production at present prices.     But thearguments against allowing this are much stronger.     They are briefly:-(a)   Under the present price structure, we are alreadyproducing far too much milk.(b)   This has its effect on our trade relations with,principally, New Zealand and Denmark, and theywould have strong objections to our encouraginggreater production.Accordingly, we did not offer any increase in the guaranteed price.5.     In the Price Review negotiations, it became crystal clear that thisiE3 ass3 would lead to a disagreed Review.     But there is a way out, which* put to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and my other colleagues on the-^rice R.eview Committee, and they agreed that I should try to achieve it.-1-SEGRET
6.      The root of the whole milk problem is the way in which the milk marketing Boards (M. M. Bs. ) pay the individual farmer.     The M. M. Bs.receive 3s. l^d. a gallon for the standard quantity (2, 000 million gallonsa year), which it is in the national interest that we should produce.For the surplus gallonage (about 300 million gallons a year at present)the M.M. Bs. only receive the world manufacturing price of Is. 6d.a gallon.    But they pay the individual farmer a &quot;pool price&quot; ofabout 2s. lOd. a gallon for all the milk he produces.    So the fact thatof the farmer1 s milk production   85 per cent is worth over 3s. , but theremaining 15 per cent only Is. 6d. is completely concealed from him.There is not much profit to the small producer in selling milk at2s. lOd. a gallon.    The income of a typical small family dairy farm isabout  600 a year - a meagre return on his capital and labour.    Inorder to increase his income, he lays out more capital to buy an extracow or two, works longer hours, produces more milk on a narrowermargin, and grumbles louder.    All this extra milk from many thousands of farms can only go to manufacture at Is. 6d. a gallon, so the poolprice is further diluted and the vicious circle goes on.7.     This problem has got to be gripped, and I believe this is^thetime to do so.    We have only two choices.     The first is to keep theprice squeeze going on milk, to the point where the pool price is so lowas to force small farmers out of producing it.    This would have mostserious consequences.     Firstly, milk production v/ould rise to an even higher level before we reached that point.     Secondly, it would take years to bring about;  it would be in the teeth of the opposition of the farming community and the Government1 s relations with them would becomeintolerable.     This would be a policy of despair, which I do not think we can consider.8.     The second choice is for the M.M. Bs. to reorganiso^voir systemof payment, so that each farmer is paid the guaranteed price for hisshare of the liquid milk market and only the manufacturing price for theremainder.     It would then be up to each producer to decide how muchmilk he wished to produce at Is. 6d. a gallon.    This would soon pullback production.     This may sound easy, but in fact it means givingeach dairy farm a quota for the liquid milk market, which raises many difficulties.     But I believe it could be done.     Similar schemes arealready worked for potatoes and hops, though these do not touch the vital interests of anything like the number&apos; of farmers as milk does.9.     I suggested to the Farm Price Review Committee, and they agreed, that I should put to the farmers that if they were to reorganisetheir affairs in this way (and responsibility for doing it will rest withthe M.M. Bs. , which are farmers1 organisations, and not with theGovernment, though my Department would help them to work out thenew system), we could Jhen meet their request to increase by srd. a gallon the price of milk within the standard quantity.    This would be good business both from the Government1 s point of view and thefarmers1.    I put it to the farmers&apos; leaders.    They would like to get an agreed Review.    They also now realize that a scheme such as thisis the only way out of the milk problem, and they are preparedimmediately to put their full weight behind working out and adopting a-2-
suitable scheme.     But they are adamant that whereas our proposals bringan increase in the price of milk to the farmer only after the scheme hasbeen worked out, they cannot agree this Review without an increase inthe milk price.    They are quite prepared to agree to a statement thatif they fail to implement such a scheme they would regard it as entirelyreasonable for the guaranteed price to be reduced next year to offset this increase.     They will also warn their members that, if they fail, therewill be no alternative to a long-term economic squeeze on milk producers,which the National Farmers1 Union v/ill be unable to resist.10.    The principal reason why they cannot agree   to a rise in the milkprice being contingent on this scheme is that they are bound by the factthat a resolution that such a scheme should be worked out was defeatedat their Annual General Meeting only two months ago.    At that time,they took no steps to encourage the resolution;   indeed, I had told themonly half way through the Review discussions (a few days ago) that we regarded such a change as a sine qua non for an increase in the milk price.They alsc argue that, knowing the farmers as they do, their approach is the right way to get them to agree to such a scheme;  whereas our suggestion would create antipathy and be interpreted as smacking ofbribery.11.     So the difference between us is that we say:   &quot;Work out thescheme, and we will then give you the increase you want&quot;.    They say:&quot;We agree the scheme is necessary.    Agree to a price increase at this review, and we will work it out.    Only thus could we carry the farmerswith us.     If we fail, we could not object to you reducing the price nextyear&quot;.12.    I believe we have here the chance to cure once and for all the milk malaise.    I did my very best to persuade the farmers to agree toour approach to it.    But they cannot and will not accept it.    Moneywisethere is little or no difference between v.s.    I agree there is the risk that, if we adopt their method, we might have to increase the price of milk without getting our new scheme.     But that would only be for oneyear eX the&apos; worst:   I believe that they will work out a scheme and thatthe risk is worth taking.     I believe that otherwise we will be living withthis milk problem for years to come, and that it will increasinglybedevil our relationship with the farmers.13.    -&quot;Looking then at the Review as a whole, we have two choices:-(a)   We impcse a Review at about t 6^- millions, leaving the guaranteed price of milk unchanged.    We would explain publicly that we offered afurther  6 millions for milk on our terms and that the farmers&apos; leadersrejected it.     The farmers would rejoin that they had assured us theywould set about working out a scheme, if we had given what they allconsider to be a sorely needed and justifiable increase now.    It would bea disagreed Review with all its consequences.     We will be able torepresent it as a reasonable Preview, but there will be dismay over the milk price and the farmers1 leaders would not have committed them-selvec to working out a new scheme.     Their co-operation in the atmosphere of disagreement would be hard to get.-3-
(b)    We get an agreed Review at about t 6f millions on other commodities, plus the  6 millions on milk.    This milk money would not fall on the Exchequer.    It would mean that the consumer would pay Sd.a pint for milk all the year round, instead of 8d. a pint for nine months and &quot;ijd. for three months.    We would then have the co-operation of the farmers&apos; leaders in working out and implementing a scheme which would bring relief to this whole problem.    If they failed to do so, the price of milk would be at least brought back again at the next Review.C. S*Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and food, S.W.I.6th March, 1961.-4-
