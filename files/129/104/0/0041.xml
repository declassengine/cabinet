(60) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 6).2. On the first point1 withstanding Soviet pressures the most vulnerablemember of the Seven would be Austria. Her Foreign Minister, Dr. Kreisky, statedin Geneva on 14th February that he no longer had any reservations about thepolitical wisdom of going ahead with Finland. This view was strongly supported,and evoked no hint of dissent from the other countries.3. On the second point, the Commonwealth countries most active in theG.A.T.T. have been consulted and, except for India, have all signified their appreciation of the political importance of associating Finland. They have also said that in the G.A.T.T. they will not press too far any criticisms of Finland&apos;transaction, although they may think it necessary to voice them, and although in theevent of a vote New Zealand may have to abstain. Indian officials have given us areassuring preliminary indication, but have said they must refer the matter to their ministers. The United States Administration have told the Finnish ambassador in Washington that Finland must expect to hear some highly critical observations,but that in view of old friendships they do not wish to create difficulties.Assurances of restraint in the G.A.T.T. have also been received from the Frenchand the Germans. Notwithstanding, therefore, that we must expect that Finland&apos;transaction will be widely deplored, and that in the eyes of the Contracting Partiessome measure of responsibility will doubtless be imputed to the members ofE.F.T.A. (including not least the United Kingdom), I am hopeful that, given careful stage-management of the discussions, we can avoid embarrassingdevelopments in the G.A.T.T.4. Officials have now agreed with the Finns in Geneva the text of anAgreement of Association which the delegations are submitting to their governments. This proposed Agreement preserves the separate identity of the seven (thereby ensuring that there will be no difficulty about their continuing tomeet without Finland to discuss, e.g., relations between the Six and Seven). It also provides that either Finland or any member country of E.F.T.A. can at any time58720(SECRET
withdraw at three months&apos; notice. The commercial content of the Agreement isthe same as the terms which were offered to Finland in May 1960 at Lisbon: withcertain specific easements for Finland, she and the E.F.T.A. countries will have(the same rights and obligations as the E.F.T.A. countries have among themselves.conclusion. I recommend that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Helsinki be authorisedto sign the draft Agreement of Association outlined in paragraph&apos;4 above;. the finns and our partners are expecting its signature to take place on 27th March.R. M.Board of Trade, S.W. 1.21st March, 1961.
