THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1961C. (61) 37 Copy No.  5 416th March, 1961CABINETECONOMIC SURVEY, 1961Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Survey, 1961, has been prepared in the same form as theEconomic Survey, 1960. It is divided into two parts: the first an assessment of theeconomic situation at the beginning of 1961 and of the factors likely to affectdevelopments in the remainder of the year; the second a factual account of developments in 1960.2. Only the first part of the 1961 Survey is being considered by ministers collectively. It has been discussed by the Economic Policy Committee, as well asby the Economic Planning Board. The draft which I now circulate incorporatessuggestions made by both bodies.  I invite the views of my colleagues upon it.3. In order to save time in discussion I suggest that my colleagues should send me suggested amendments as soon as possible so that I can circulate beforethe meeting a list of amendments which I should like to accept.S.

ECONOMIC SURVEY 1961This Economic Survey is divided into two parts; in the first the mainevents in 1960 are briefly described and an assessment is made of theprospects for 1961 ; in the second economic developments in 1960 arereviewed in some detail.PART one .  THE UNITED KINGDOM ECONOMY IN 19601. The rapid expansion of total demand and output which took place inthe United Kingdom in 1959 continued in the early months of 1960 withfew signs of general slackening. At the beginning of the year pressure on resources was increasing ; shortages of labour and materials were re-appearing ; delivery dates tended to lengthen ; and imports were rising rapidly.To check the rise in the pressure of demand a series of restraining measureswas taken by the Government. In January 1960 Bank Rate was increased from 4 to 5 per cent. In the Budget some increases in taxation were announced. The net effect of the Budget proposals was to increase revenueby an estimated  18 million in 1960/61 and by an estimated  87 million in a full year. At the end of April restrictions on hire purchase were re-imposed ; and for the first time the Bank of England called for specialdeposits from the London Clearing and Scottish banks. At the end of Junethese measures were reinforced by a further increase in Bank Rate, to 6 percent., and by another call for special deposits by the Bank of England.2. Largely as a result of these measures, the rise in home demand slowed down considerably after the first quarter of 1960. But fixed investment,which had already increased by about 9 per cent, during 1959, continued torise rapidly during 1960 : in the year as a whole the ratio of investmentto gross national product was 19 per cent, compared with 17-6 per cent,in 1959. There was also some increase in public current expenditure on defence, health, education and other goods and services. The rate of stockaccumulation rose rapidly in the first half of 1960, as it did throughout 1959,and flattened out at a very high level in the second half of the year. the credit restrictions had a damping effect on personal consumption. In 1959personal incomes had been supplemented by very substantial borrowing ; hire purchase debt and bank advances increased by  450 million, and borrowing from these two sources continued at a very high rate in the early months of1960. There was a sharp change of trend after the end of April, when the hire purchase restrictions and the special deposits were introduced; and inthe second half of 1960 consumers were repaying debt more quickly thanthey were borrowing. This, coupled with the long term trend for savings to increase, brought about a slight fall in total consumption, despite anincrease in the purchasing power of personal incomes (the growth of moneyincome after tax over and above the rise in prices) which was larger thanin any other post-war year. The counterpart of this was a sharp rise inthe ratio of personal savings to disposable income from an average of 7-6 per
cent, in 1959 to a record figure of 94 per cent, in 1960. In 1960 as awhole exports were 6 per cent, higher than in 1959 ; but, partly because ofa general slackening of world trade, they fell during the year from the peaklevel achieved in the early months and, although there was some recoverylater, exports in the last quarter of 1960 were no higher than in the last quarter of 1959.3. There was no net rise in industrial production in the last three quarters of 1960: some industries continued to increase their output, but the effectof this was offset by a fall in the output of household durable goods andsubsequently of passenger cars. The small rise in total demand after thefirst quarter was met by imports which rose quite rapidly throughoutthe year. Civil employment went on rising and there was a declinein the number of wholly unemployed. Towards the end of the year there were some signs that the pressure of demand for labour was easing,but these were mainly confined to the motor car industry and otherindustries producing consumer durable goods. The difficulties in these industries were met in 1960 largely by short-time working rather thanby discharges. Thus shortages in other industries were not alleviated by are-deployment of labour. Unemployment in December 1960 was at a level well below that of a year earlier. Most of the fall took place in those areas where unemployment was greater than the national average(particularly Scotland, Wales and the North-West of England).4. Between the beginning of 1958 and the autumn of 1960 retail prices were almost stable. For this the fall in import prices in the second halfof 1957 was partly responsible. But the main reason why prices rose so littlewas that the increase in average earnings per head (including salaries) slowed down. Between 1948 and 1958 the average annual increase was 6^ per cent.;but during 1958 and 1959 it was 2-  and 3  per cent, respectively.5. During 1960 the rise in earnings per head accelerated: in the second half of the year they were 6  per cent, higher than in the second half of1959. National productivity did not rise as much and moreover cannot beexpected, on the basis of experience, to rise at so high a rate over a periodof years. There has developed in consequence an upward pressure on costs and prices. This has begun to reveal itself in the retail price index whichin December 1960 was l-8lhigher than a year earlier: this increase wouldhave been greater but for a fall in food import prices and exceptionallylarge home supplies of fruit and vegetables, which cannot be counted uponto occur again. The rise in labour costs has begun to cause the prices of manufactured products to rise again. If increases in pay continue to outstripthe rise in national productivity, the pressure on costs and prices will be intensified and ability to export will be impaired.6. Thus during 1960 the Governmenfs restrictive measures checked totalhome demand ; consumption fell slightly and investment rose strongly ; therate of stock building rose little after the middle of the year. Imports rosethroughout the year and this, together with the fall in exports after the first quarter, caused the balance of payments to worsen. There was, however,such a substantial inflow of funds into the United Kingdom, encouraged bythe differential between interest rates in London and other financial centres,that the United Kingdom&apos;s reserves of gold and convertible currencies rose
that firms in manufacturing industry are planning to spend 30 per cent,more in 1961 than they did in 1960. A substantial further rise, of about10 per cent, between 1960 and 1961, is also expected in investment by the distributive and service industries; and a recent enquiry by the Ministryof Works into the intentions of private builders suggests that the numberof private houses started, which levelled off between the spring of 1960and the end of the year, will rise again in 1961.15. Public investment (the capital expenditures of the Government, localauthorities and nationalised industries and other public corporations) will,taken as a whole, probably rise a little this year. As shown in the white paper Public Investment in Great Britain (Cmnd. 1203) presented to Parlia-ment in November 1960, expenditure in the financial year 1961/62 isexpected to be rather higher than in 1960/61.16. These forward indications suggest that fixed investment demand,which in total has risen rapidly since the beginning of 1959, will continueto rise rapidly in 1961 and will increase the pressure on some industries whichare already very fully occupied.17. Although production did not rise after the first quarter of 1960,stocks were rising in the last three quarters at a rate that was exceptionally high by comparison with previous years. It therefore seems probablethat the rate of increase will slow down in 1961. Taken by itself thiswould reduce demand at home and may lead to a reduction of imports.18. To sum up, personal and public consumption are expected to risesomewhat in 1961. There is likely to be a further rapid increase in private investment and some increase in public investment. The rate of stockbuildingwill probably fall. The increase foreseen in consumption and investment should be sufficiently large to cause a significant increase in total domesticoutput in 1961 ; but the size of this increase will depend also on the levelof exports and the extenit to which total demand is met by imports duringthe year. The population of working age, which was of the order of31,650,000 in 1960, is expected to increase by about 60,000 in 1961, whichis equivalent to the average increase in recent years; and there should be afurther increase in the numbers in civil employment.External position19. During both 1959 and 1960, the balance of payments on current account has been inadequate to finance net long-term investment andlending overseas. The very small current account* surplus of  30 million in 1959 was followed in 1960 by a large current account deficit of  335million. The expansion of the economy over the past two years hasresulted in a substantial increase in imports; but there has not been an equivalent increase in1 exports. There has also been a further deterioration in invisible account. At the same time Government lending abroad hasincreased and private investment has remained at a high level.        -* These figures are affected by changes in the basis of computing the statistics which re-duce the current balance surplus or increase the deficit, with corresponding offsets in otherparts of the balance of payments account. Fuller details of these changes are given in theBalance of Payments White Paper (Cmnd. ). The external monetary position is virtually unaffected by these changes although it showed a substantial deterioration in 1960.
20. Despite the unsatisfactory outturn on current account, the reservesincreased by  177 million during 1960. This was mainly due to the verylarge inflow of funds from abroad. A substantial part of this inflow is recorded in the overseas sterling holdings but there was also a large increase in unrecorded credits, which suggests that there was also someunrecorded inflow of funds. These inflows were encouraged by relatively high interest rates but they do not form a dependable basis for maintaininglong term investment and overseas aid at their present levels ; this can beprovided satisfactorily only by an adequate balance on current account.21. In 1961 the current account will probably be helped by a decreasein imports, arising in part from the expeoted reduction in the rate of stock-building. But any substantial improvement must rest upon an expansion of exports. This will depend in part on the level of world trade, but much more on competitiveness in prices and the maintenance of deliveries, as well ason initiative in expanding existing and developing new markets. The Govern-ment have mounted an intensive campaign to publicise the need for continued expansion of exports, and the range of Government services available tohelp exporters. They have extended export credit guarantee facilities ;and they have supported the action of industry in setting up the ExportCouncil for Europe and in reconstituting the Dollar Exports Council toform the Western Hemisphere Export Council.The balance of the economy and long term growth22. The most important factor in the growth of national real income isthe rate of growth of total output of goods and services per head of thelabour force. In the inter-war period this rate of growth was about \\ percent, per annum. During the 1950&apos;s there was on average an annual increase of more than 2 per cent., though year-to-year movements are somewhat irregular and hard to interpret. Since 1956/57 the figure maywell have risen to 2\ per cent, per annum; and, with the present high level of industrial investment, the capacity for growth ds still increasing.23. It is the Governments policy to encourage^ growth. The commit-ment to maintain full employment is an important contribution to this end.It gives an assurance both to capital and to labour that periods of industrialrecession and heavy unemployment, such as discouraged capital development in many industries before the war, will not be allowed to recur. Someelements in demand are liable to fluctuate considerably from time to time above all, exports, fixed investment and investment in stocks. Changes inthese could produce serious instability, and the Government is thereforeobliged from time to time to influence the level of demand either upwardsor downwards. Restrictive measures, such as Chose taken recenlty, are designed to check tendencies towards an excessive pressure of demand ;as is generally recognised, excess demand damages the internal value ofmoney and the balance of payments.24. A stimulus has been given in past years to industrial investment bythe introduction of the investment allowances, and these were maintainedlast year notwithstanding the measures taken to restrict other demand. the aim has been to restrain the growth of demand without checking the incentive to invest; and in recent years there has been a remarkablegrowth in investment.
25. The effect on demand of the Government^ policy of maintaining a high and stable level of employment, together with their policies designedto stimulate investment, have created two of the conditions necessary forsustained growth of the economy. But the motive power for economic growth cannot be created by the Government alone. Much will depend upon the determination of industry to adapt itself to changes in demand,to make greater use of facilities for education and training at all levels and to plan boldly investment for increased production and reduced costs.It will not be possible to expand production, increase exports, and maintainfull employment, without the fullest co-operadon of employers and workersindividually and collectively in the introduction of new plant and methods,and in ensuring that increases in incomes are not such as to raise thegeneral level of costs. Indeed important factors are the ability andwillingness of both sides of industry to reduce costs and to share withconsumers, in the form of lower prices, part of the fruit of increasedproducdvity, especially in those industries where productivity increasesfaster than the national average. In all these matters the Government can help and stimulate, but what ultimately happens depends upon the action and attitudes of industry as a whole.26. Finally, for a country in the international position of the UnitedKingdom, it is axiomatic that the growth of the economy must be inter-locked with the growth of exports-otherwise the balance of paymentssituation is bound to frustrate growth and force a reversal of direction.Endeavours by Government and industry to foster the growth of the economy will succeed only if they are also designed to improve the country&apos;s com-petitive power.   Growth and competitiveness can never be separated.
