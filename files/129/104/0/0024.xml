CONFIDENTIAL T-Jx    %S DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)24 COPY NO.20th February, 1961CABINETMALTA - CONSTITUTIONAL, CHANGESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the Colonial Policy Committee invited me to circulate amemorandum comparing the present constitutional status of Singaporewith that which would obtain under the proposals for Malta.2. A comparative table is annexed.3. In Singapore the local Legislature is responsible for legislation on defence and foreign affairs.     The United Kingdom Government have no right under the constitution to initiate legislation but can only request the Singapore Government to act.    It is only if the Singapore Govern-ment and Legislature refuse to comply with a United Kingdom request that the United Kingdom Commissioner can advise the Head of state to make an Order.    If the Head of State refuses to do so the only remedyis to suspend the constitution.4. In Malta the United Kingdom Commissioner will have the right topass legislation which will override local legislation.5. As in Singapore, internal security in Malta will be theresponsibility of local Ministers;  but there will be no internal security Council procedure.    In Malta there is not, of course, thesame problem of subversion as in Singapore nor is there a third partywho could take on the role of the Federation of Malaya in an internal security Council.    The United Kingdom Commissioner^ power to intervene by legislation and executive action in internal securitymatters affecting our defence interests should give us in practicea stronger position in Malta than we have in Singapore in relation to internal security;   nor shall we be dependent on the goodwill of a third party.6. In Singapore the control of the police force is in the hands of singapore Ministers, though the Internal Security Council have a responsibility for the efficiency of the police and can take decisionsbinding on the Singapore Government.    In Malta the police force will,initially, be under the control of a British Governor who will also beable to ensure the necessary funds from Malta revenue.-1-
confidential . In both Singapore and Malta the procedure for &quot;reserving&quot;legislation for signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure will be similar.The field over which this power can be exercised will be more extensive in Malta.I. M.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.17th February, 1961.-2-
