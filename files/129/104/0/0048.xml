THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1961C. (61) 48 Copy No.28th March, 1961CABINETBALANCE OF PAYMENTS STATISTICSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the statistics about the balance of payments to be published as a White paper on 29th March have been compiled on a different basis from that used in the past.My colleagues will, no doubt, wish to know the reasons for the change of basis, themost important revisions and their significance.Reasons2. Full statistics on the United Kingdom balance of payments are publishedhalf-yearly in a White Paper. The last was Cmnd. 118S. The next, appearing on29th March and covering the years 1958 to 1960, includes some important changesin the basis of compilation. These changes were necessary for two main reasons.First, Exchange Control procedures have been simplified over recent years in theinterests of traders and others, and alternative sources have had to be found forinformation previously derived from Exchange Control records. Second, new sources of information have become available, partly as a result of investigations seton foot some years ago.Changes3.  The principal changes are:(a) The results of the Board of Trade&apos;s inquiry into overseas direct investment(already published in the Board of Trade Journal of 7th October and17th February last) have replaced previous estimates of earnings and investment of this type.(b) The Trade Accounts are now being used, after adjustment, for all imports and exports. Previously imports from the non-sterling areas were basedon Exchange Control data.(c) More extended use has been made of inquiries conducted by the general council of British Shipping; in particular, this is now the source of theestimates for tanker transactions.More information is now given on a number of other items and some are re-allocatedwithin the current account.Effect4. Many figures have been revised as a result of these changes, but one very important set of figures remains virtually unaffected. This is &quot;monetarymovements&quot;, including the United Kingdom V chief quick assets (the reserves)and liquid liabilities (sterling holdings). This set of figures measures the totaloutcome. of the United Kingdom balance of payments, and there is therefore no need for reassessment of that outcome.5. Two other parts of the account have been significantly affected, however:the estimates of the balance on current account and of the balance on long-term58757
capital account. A comparison of the old and the new figures is given below for1958 and 1959, no figures on the old basis having been published previously for1960 as a whole:  millions1958 1959Current account balance Last White Paper   .........      4-345 +139New White Paper   .........      +291 -b 51Reduction    ......... 54 88Long-term capital account balance Last White Paper   ......... -259 -553New White Paper   ......... -179 -495Reduction    ......... 80 58In short, the net result of all the changes is to reduce the estimated surplus on current account by  54 millions in 1958 and by  88 millions in 1959, and to reducealso the estimated deficit on lons-term capital account by  80 millions in 1958 andby  58 millions in 1959.6. A major factor in this result is the incorporation of the findings of theBoard of Trade inquiry referred to at 3 (a) above. Although many other changes have been made, their net effect is relatively small. This inquiry revealed id) thatprofits on overseas investment in the United Kingdom were substantially higherthan had previously been allowed for, and ib) that nearly all of these extra profitswere being retained and reinvested in the United Kingdom. Although noremittance across the exchanges is involved, in the balance of payments retainedprofits are treated as a debit in the current account (reducing the current surplus)and as a credit in the long-term capital account (reducing the long-term capitaldeficit). The debit and credit are of equal amount, so that the balance on current and long-term capital accounts taken together is not affected.7. Our knowledge of the multitude of transactions which enter the balanceof payments has always been and still remains incomplete, although much freshinformation is now being used. The existence of a sizeable balancing item indicates that many transactions still escape record, so that there is room for further improvement of the estimates. The present estimates provide the fullest explanationit is possible to give on the basis of the information now available.8. To sum up, the following are the main points to which I should draw mycolleagues&apos; attention:id) The total outcome of the balance of payments is as before, since the figuresof &quot; monetary movements &quot; are virtually unchanged.(b) The current account surplus is reduced by the new figures for retainedprofits on overseas investment in the United Kingdom, but there is anoffsetting reduction of the deficit on long-term capital account as aresult of the corresponding investment of these profits in the UnitedKingdom.(c) Although the outflow of investment capital from the United Kingdomremains virtually unaltered, it has been regularly matched to a greater extent than was previously known by investment by other countriesin the United Kingdom. In these conditions the United Kingdom cansupport a given level of outward investment by a smaller surplus on current account.id) The estimates of the balances on current and capital account now publishedare not comparable with those for 1957 and earlier years.S.
