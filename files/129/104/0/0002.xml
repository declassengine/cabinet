THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1961C. (61) 2 Copy No.    5 430th January, 1961CABINETROAD SAFETYMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department the Queen&apos;s Speech said that we were &quot; preparing legislation designed topromote greater safety on the roads&quot; and the Cabinet have approved theintroduction of a Road Safety Bill in the present Session. The most importantelements in the Bill will be a new scheme of penalties for motoring offences anda change in the law of driving under the influence of drink. Both of these havebeen devised by a Committee of Ministers under the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and approved by the Home Affairs Committee.Penalties for Motoring OffencesUse of Disqualification2. We do not believe that a straightforward increase in penalties would necessarily act as an incentive to the exercise of greater care on the roads. Onthe contrary, it might serve only to make magistrates and juries even morereluctant than they already are to convict drivers of the more serious offences.Instead, the proposed scheme would make a greatly increased use of disqualificationwhich, although it contains a strong deterrent and punitive element, is also ameasure of prevention: in other words, a motorist who either commits one ofthe more serious offences against road safety or is an habitual offender shouldsimply not be allowed on the road for a period.3. The scheme we recommend is an essentially simple one, intended to rationalise the whole system of penalties as it now exists. The scheme woulddivide motoring offences into three categories:A. The most serious offences, which (with one exception) would attractautomatic disqualification on conviction, in most cases for a minimum of 12 months but for longer if the Court thought fit.B. Offences which, although less serious, are a definite source of danger onthe roads and would attract disqualification at the discretion of theCourt.C. Relatively minor offences for which there would be no disqualification.On conviction of any offence in category A or B (which are set out in the annex to this report) the driver&apos;s licence would automatically be endorsed. Each separateendorsement would have a life of three years and any driver who had on his licencethree live endorsements at any one time i.e., had been convicted of A or Boffences three times within three years (whether the same or different offences) would, on the third conviction, automatically be disqualified for six months. It is this last point, &quot; cumulative &quot; disqualification, which is of course the central andnovel feature of the scheme.4. There are two important points in the scheme on which the Home AffairsCommittee were not wholly agreed. The first is the penalties for dangerous drivingand for causing death by dangerous driving (both of which are in category A).The Committee propose that, on conviction of the first offence of dangerous driving,disqualification should be at the discretion of the Court (the only exception to theprinciple of automatic disqualification for A offences) while for any offence of58405
causing death by dangerous driving disqualification should be automatic. they recognise that there is no logical distinction between the two offences and that itmay not be easy to defend treating an offender more harshly because, purely by,ill-luck, his offence has happened to result in someone&apos;s being killed. But themajority view is that the public attitude to the taking of life by a criminal act is such that in these cases there ought to be some vindictive element in the treatmentaccorded to the offender.5. The second point is the criterion for the inclusion of offences in category Bso that they count towards &quot; cumulative &quot; disqualification. The majority view ofthe Committee, as expressed in the Annex, is that for this purpose category B should include not only offences of actual bad driving, such as speeding, but also other formsof dangerous behaviour on the roads, e.g., serious breaches of traffic regulations anddriving a car in a dangerous condition. Some members have argued that the scheme would be more acceptable to Parliament and the motoring public if only offences of bad driving counted towards &quot; cumulative &quot; disqualification and that otherdangerous offences should be appropriately punished at the time (the Courts havingthe discretion to disqualify) but should not be &quot; totted up &quot; in addition. The list can,and no doubt will, be criticised and adjusted when the Bill is in Standing Committee,but on balance we recommend that the criterion for category B should be dangerousbehaviour on the roads rather than bad driving alone.Power to Remit Disqualification6. Under the law as it stands the Courts have power to grant remission aftersix months or, where the period af disqualification is for more than a year, afterhalf the period or three years, whichever is the less. The effect of this is that, wherethe original period of disqualification was a year or less, it is in practice remittedafter six months in no less than half the cases. Good arguments can be advancedfor abolishing altogether the power of the Courts to remit, but there are ratherserious objections to this. The present over-generosity of the Courts could, wesuggest, be avoided if the power to remit were limited to the High Court andQuarter Sessions (although there may be a case for retaining it in the hands of the sheriff Courts in Scotland). The position could be further strengthened if thepresent minimum of six months within which remission may not be granted were increased to twelve months, but we are inclined to doubt whether this change willbe necessary if the power to remit is taken out of the hands of the magistrates.Fines and Imprisonment7. We have considered in detail revised penalties for each of the offences inall three categories, with which we do not think it necessary to trouble the Cabinet.As part of the process of rationalising the penalties system, we have adopted thefollowing principles:(i) The present differentiation between the penalties on the first and onsubsequent convictions of the same offence, which is derived from thegeneral law, cannot in our view suitably be applied to most motoringoffences and would have even less significance if our scheme of&quot; cumulative &quot; disqualification were introduced. We therefore proposethat the differentiation should be abolished in all appropriate cases.(ii) The level of fines should be raised to take account of the changed valueof money since they were first established.(iii) For a wide range of offences in category C the Courts should no longerhave the power to order imprisonment. In practice they never, or hardlyever, do.(iv) For a relatively few C offences the Courts should no longer have the powerto order endorsement of the driver&apos;s licence or disqualification. this can be justified by the need to make the scheme as a whole readilyintelligible to the motoring public.Drink and Driving8. As with motoring offences generally, one of the difficulties of dealingadequately with drunken driving is that the Courts are reluctant to convict as oftenas they should. We have therefore approached this problem from the angle ofmaking it easier for the prosecution to secure convictions in proper cases.
9. The Scandinavian countries have gone to the extreme. They apply, in one form or another, provisions under which motorists may be compelled to submit totests to establish the alcohol content of their blood and evidence of a certain levelof alcohol is conclusive proof of an offence, resulting in automatic conviction.This country is clearly not ready to accept so rigorous an approach.10. It is necessary under our present law to prove that an offender was &quot; underthe influence of drink ... to such an extent as to be incapable of having propercontrol of a motor vehicle &quot;. We believe that the suggestion of &quot; drunk andincapable &quot; in the words of the statute are an obstacle to convictions and wetherefore propose that the offence should be re-defined in terms of &quot; impairedability to drive properly &quot;. This should enable the Courts to deal effectively withanyone who is drunk enough to be a danger on the roads as well as with clear casesof drunkenness in the ordinarily accepted sense.11. It is already a widespread practice of the police to invite motoristssuspected of &quot; driving under the influence &quot; to undergo a test, normally of the urine.We are satisfied that testing should remain voluntary, but we consider that the handsof the police would be strengthened if two express provisions were introduced intothe statute law:(i) That the Courts should be required to have regard to any evidence of theresult of a test of the alcohol content of the accuseds blood.(ii) That, if the accused has refused to undergo a test without any reasonableexplanation, &quot; his refusal may be treated as supporting any evidence given on behalf of the prosecution, or as rebutting any evidence given onbehalf of the defence, with respect to his condition at that time &quot;.12. The Law Officers remain doubtful of the need for any change in the lawand are uneasy that the second recommendation above will be criticised asundermining two principles of English law that every person is assumed tobe innocent until he is proved to be guilty and that no one is obliged to provideevidence against himself. Nevertheless, the Law Officers have been the first to acknowledge that the majority of the Committee support a clause on the lines recommended and that it is difficult to find a workmanlike alternative.13. The Bill would leave entirely open, as at present, the method of testingto be adopted. It would normally be a urine test but blood testing could beadopted where the necessary facilities were available and breath testing could beintroduced if and when reliable equipment for that purpose has been developed.Recommendations14.   We invite the Cabinet to agree:(i) That the Road Safety Bill should provide for the scheme of &quot; cumulative &quot;disqualification outlined in paragraph 3.(ii) That causing death by dangerous driving should be treated more severelythan dangerous driving (paragraph 4).(iii) That all offences which are a source of serious danger on the roads shouldcount towards &quot; cumulative &quot; disqualification not only those whichconsist of bad driving (paragraph 5).(iv) That a rationalised system of penalties for motoring offences should beadopted in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 7.(v) That the offence of driving under the influence of drink should be re-defined as in paragraph 10, and the practice of the Courts in dealing with thatoffence should be laid down as recommended in paragraph 11.R.
