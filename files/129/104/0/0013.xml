Report on Defence, 1961There is only one answer to the threat to mankind posed by armaments.This is to reach a satisfactory agreement on general disarmament undereffective international control. We&quot; intend to press for this by all means inour power; but we should not under-estimate the difficulties of the task, orthe length of time that it may take to accomplish it.2. Although the Soviet leaders have recently declared their pacificintentions, and are making some reductions in Service manpower, the strengthof the Soviet forces remains very great. Mr. Khrushchev, when announcing the reductions, was at pains to say that their forces would not be weakened.In particular, he emphasised the great stocks of nuclear weapons and missilespossessed by the Soviet Union.3. The Soviet fleet of submarines is of great size. Mr. Khrushchev hasclaimed the possession of nuclear submarines. We must expect the numberof these to increase and that they will carry nuclear missiles. China alsomaintains very large armed forces.4. The Government welcome the statement that these weapons would only be used against an aggressor. Nevertheless, the existence of immensemilitary power in the Soviet bloc and China must be of deep concern to theWest.5. Soviet and Chinese military strength could be used for direct offensive action against the Western Allies or for military intervention in inflammablesituations in any part of the world. In addition it can be, and is, used inconjunction with Communist subversive activities to exert political pressure on smaller countries, and to undermine their independence and will to resistoutside interference.DEFENCE policy. Until general disarmament has been achieved, peace rests on themaintenance of adequate power by the West to discourage aggression by theSoviet bloc and China. Our own contribution to the deterrent strength ofthe West must itself be balanced both as against other demands on the economy, which we must satisfy if we are to hold our own in the struggleof competetive co-existence, and as to the proportion of our resourcesdevoted to the various components of the Defence programme. We seek to achieve the balance that will best serve our own military needs, as well asthe needs of the Western Alliance. In this we must recognise that many ofour most important responsibilities are not concerned with the directdeterrence of all out global war, but rather with the checking of smalloutbreaks which could grow into nuclear war by accident or design.58315c*
MAIN deployment of THE SERVICES
7. Aggressors have the initiative, and often the advantage of surprise.It follows that a defence policy which, satisfies the condition of economy of force, and presents in itself no threat of aggression, must depend on itsevident power of rapid and certain retaliation against any form of attack.8. The primary purpose of our defence policy is, therefore, that it shouldprotect us, our allies and our friends against the whole spectrum of possibleaggression and military threats, from the small local action which might bethe beginning of larger and more dangerous adventures through &quot;nuclearblackmail &quot; to nuclear war. We implement this policy in three main ways.9. First, we are founder members of the three Collective SecurityAlliances: NATO, CENTO and SEATO, and we make importantcontributions to all three.10. Secondly, we contribute to the strategic nuclear deterrent forces ofthe West; and this contribution not only adds a valuable degree of diversityto the Western forces as a whole, but also adds significantly to their strengthand to the rapidity with which they can react.11. Finally, we maintain increasingly efficient conventional forces,mobile and well armed, and organised and deployed to protect our interestsaround the world; by their very presence they make an effective contribution towards the maintenance of peace.12. Within this general framework, the deployment of our forces will beperiodically reviewed to make sure that it continues to meet changingconditions. The Government, in consultation with their military advisers,have recently completed such a review covering the next ten years. Thiswill enable us to adjust our plans, as necessary, to the needs of this period.THE CONVENTIONAL FORCE13. Our conventional forces are now organised to provide militarycontributions to the three Collective Security Alliances and to our othergarrisons overseas, and also to provide a reserve of forces at home, in kenya and in Malaya.14. The efficiency and state of readiness of our forces in all these areas is being steadily improved by such measures as the establishment of localstockpiles, increased facilities for the rapid air movement of troops andequipment, and increased naval strength.15. Outside Europe our military organisation overseas now includestwo unified commands, which from 1st March will be known as the near east and Middle East Commands, with headquarters in Cyprus and Adenrespectively. The question of establishing a similar unified command inthe Far East is under examination.THE NUCLEAR FORCE16. Our contribution to the strategic nuclear deterrent at present is theV-bomber force equipped with British free-falling nuclear bombs.  The force
has the capacity to penetrate to its assigned targets, and its retaliatorycapacity and efficiency are being constantly increased by wider dispersal andshorter reaction time.17. We expect that our main contribution to the Western deterrent overthe next decade will be provided by weapons carried in aircraft; and thetask of replacing the present type of V-bombers with improved Mk. IIversions is well in hand. To counter probable improvements in fighter andmissile defences, these aircraft will be given an increasing &quot; stand off&quot;capability over this period. The missiles which carry the British-madewarhead from the aircraft to its target must be of such type and characteristicsas will present the greatest diversity of attack. In this a number of systems,including ballistic and low level, have their part to play. From British and american sources it is hoped to provide Bomber Command with a combina-tion of these methods.18. We also maintain in service a force of tactical aircraft equipped with nuclear as well as conventional weapons. Such aircraft are operated by the Royal Navy from carriers, as well as by the Royal Air Force. Thedevelopment of a British tactical nuclear weapon for the Army is proceeding.NATO19. The largest part of our defence effort is concentrated in NATO,and it is Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ policy to continue to give full support to the Alliance.20. The problems arising from the increasing numbers and types of nuclear weapons now available to NATO members were considered at the nato Ministerial Council meeting, last December.21. The Council took note of a United States suggestion that the concept of an M.R.B.M. multilateral force should be considered by NATO. TheCouncil also heard the views of other members and considered a proposal by Her Majesty&apos;s Government for a comprehensive study of the nucleararmoury in support of NATO with the purposes of making the deterrent as effective as possible without waste of resources and of strengthening the alliance. A full study of all these matters, including the United Kingdomproposal, is now being made.22. Britain already contributes Valiant jet bombers and Canberras to NATO tactical air forces. If the Alliance should decide to set up a stockpileor pool of nuclear weapons for the tactical role, we should be willing tomake our contribution, provided we were satisfied that the political controlover the pool was such as to ensure rapid decisions in an emergency.INTERDEPENDENCE23. A narrow, nationalist policy for the choice and production of armsmakes no sense to-day. On the other hand, a monolithic system under central control, on the Communist model, would be unthinkable in the free world;but we should disregard at our peril the strength that it gives to theCommunist world.
24. Interdependence means more than bilateral or multilateral armsdeals, important as these are. The interchange of research and developmenttechniques, and the sharing of logistic and training facilities all have their part to play in strengthening the free world alliance, and in maintaining a firmdeterrent to would-be aggressors. We have been in the lead in offering theresults of our research and development efforts to NATO, and in offering to share support and training facilities. We agreed to provide facilities for adepot ship, and floating dock, in Holy Loch for United States polaris submarines as part of our contribution to strengthening the Alliance as awhole.25. We have put forward plans for accelerating progress towardsinterdependence by concentrating effort on a selected number of majorweapon projects. These plans were approved at the last meeting of the nato Defence Ministers, and Her Majesty&apos;s Government welcome thedecision taken at the NATO Council meeting in December last to press on with these projects to speedy results.DEFENCE PLANNING26. Because defence planning must match the changing intentions and capabilities of forces which may be opposed to us, there can be no finalityabout it.  Deployment and balance must be continually re-examined.27. Plans may also be radically affected by technological change. At this time of rapid scientific development, even advanced weapons are almost sureto be superseded by something still more advanced. If we are to maintain ourposition in the world, we must be ready to start new projects, however complexthey may be. Equally we must be ready to scrap anything that has servedits purpose or become outmoded.28. Both the United States and Russia spend on research anddevelopment alone sums greater than our total defence budget. We obviouslycannot afford to spend on this scale, yet we have to ensure that the quality of our defence research and development is at least equal, and that it isefficiently and economically carried out. . .29. It is also necessary to keep close watch on the tendency for the costof maintaining armed forces of a given size to rise steadily over the years.30. How to keep our place, to preserve a proper balance in our effort,and to avoid the risk of deploying our limited resources of manpower and money over too wide a field has been the subject of much study. some experience has now been obtained of the system of preparing in the early summer of each year a full forward costing of the defence programme,covering the following five financial years. By this means our forwardcommitments can be balanced against the forward estimate of our means.This technique is still at an early stage of development and is capable offurther improvement; but it has already proved its worth. New methodshave also been introduced to ensure that research and development projectsare effectively monitored.58315
THE SIZE OF OUR FORCES31. The size of the all-regular United Kingdom Forces at which theGovernment is aiming is as follows:Royal Navy          ...      ... 88,000 adult male all ranksArmy         ......... 165,000    ,,      ,,   ,,to about      ... 180,000    ,,      ,,   ,, ,,Royal Air Force     ...... 135,000    ,,      ,,   ,, ,,These strengths have been established in the light of the following factors :(a) Our foreseeable commitments.(b) The increasing support to be obtained from civilianisation and theWomen&apos;s Services.(c) Increases in fire power and efficiency; the introduction of new types of aircraft into Transport Command; the introduction of thecommando carrier and the new concept of assault forces for the Navy.(d) The reorganisation of the Territorial Army and the plans now beingworked out for the Reserves.(e) The strength of local forces overseas.(/) A calculation of the size of all-regular forces that we can afford tomaintain and provide with up-to-date equipment.THE VOLUNTEER FORCES32. There is an element of risk in giving up conscription and relying onvolunteers. But the Government are satisfied that it is a risk that ought to beaccepted. Conscription makes heavy demands on the economy. The^efficiency of the Services is affected by the constant turn-over of men, and because the training task is out of proportion to the length of useful service;a much higher level of training and efficiency is attainable in an all-regularforce.33. The Government believe that the targets they have set are attainable.The Services now offer demanding, but attractive careers to men and women,as officers and other ranks. Plans have been made to see that, over the next twelve months, these advantages are brought home to young people themselves and to all those who influence them in their choice of a career.THE COST OF DEFENCE34. In 1961-62, the Defence Budget will total  1,655-6 million. It isexpected to absorb a somewhat smaller proportion of the Gross national product than it did in 1960-61, when the figure was 7-2 per cent.
35.   The total is distributed as follows:  millionAdmiralty      ................ 413-20War Office    ......      ......      ... 506-90Air Ministry............... 526-67Ministry of Aviation.........      ... 190-20Ministry of Defence............ 18-63Total    ............ 1,655-6036. Of this total some 52 per cent, is required for the pay, food, clothing,housing and movement of the forces.37. The greater part of the expenditure on Defence will continue to be devoted to the maintenance of conventional forces. Britain&apos;s contributionto the strategic nuclear capability of the West, remains about 10 per cent,of the Defence Budget.TRENDS OF DEFENCE EXPENDITURECN.P AND DEFENCE EXPENDITURE AT CURRENT PRICES6.N.R AND DEFENCE EXPENDITURE  AT CONSTANT prices defence EXPENDITURE AS A % OF G.N.RDEFENCE EXPENDITURE AS A % OF TOTALCENTRAL   GOVERNMENT  CURRENT  EXPENDITURE
CIVIL DEFENCE38. The Government have reviewed Home Defence plans and have concluded that some additional expenditure is needed in order to secure abetter balanced and realistic programme in which Government Departments,local authorities, and the essential services, together with the Civil DefenceCorps and the industrial civil defence organisations, can all play their part.39. For these purposes, the estimated defence expenditure of civil departments next year will be  18 58 million*. This compares with thefigure of  15 37 million* for the current year.40. The programme makes some additional provision for the main-tenance and development of measures for oil storage and distribution; forthe protection of public water supplies; for maintaining ports; shipping and railway movements; and for emergency medical services. More trainingequipment will be provided for the Civil Defence Corps and the emergencyfire service. There will be additional stock-piling of radiac equipment forthe essential services. New steps will be taken to stockpile equipment for operational &apos;fire-fighting. The warning and monitoring system will be further developed and arrangements made to link it with the Ballistic Missile early warning System at Fylingdales.41. Co-operation in exercises and planning between the Services and civil authorities at all levels, will be further developed in order to ensurethat available Service manpower could be effectively deployed to aid thecivil power in war.SUMMARYUntil a satisfactory agreement can be reached on general disarmament&quot;under effective international control, the only policy for this country to pursue is to prevent war by maintaining, in conjunction with our allies,nuclear and conventional forces that will demonstrate to an aggressor thathe cannot expect to obtain advantage by resort to war.The cost of defence is high, but not crippling. The responsibilities itbrings particularly the responsibility of holding nuclear weapons to preservepeace are heavy. But we must not, and most of us do not wish to, shedithe burden. We have peace, and we believe that we can continue to havelit if we are prepared to play our full part in deterring war. This is theinspiration and reward of those who serve the defence of their country inmany fields.The functions of the Minister of Defence, with which this paper isconcerned, are laid down in Cmnd. 476, as follows:&quot;. . . . The Minister of Defence has authority to decide (subject to the responsibilities of the Cabinet and the Defence Committee) all majormatters of defence policy affecting the size, shape, organisation anddisposition of the Armed Forces and their weapons and war-like equip-ment and supply (including defence research and development)&quot;.Matters of concern to one Service only are dealt with in the memoranda on the individual Service Estimates.* Both these figures exclude the capital expenditure of the Post Office.
APPENDIXDEFENCE STATISTICS, 1961-62Manpower1. An analysis of the active strengths of the three Services is given in annex I, Table 1.2. In 1961-62 the Armed Forces will need about 46,000 male entrants.This figure includes men who enter upon regular engagements, and those whoenter as boys, apprentices and juniors.3. An analysis of the Volunteer Reserve and Auxiliary Forces and national Services Reserves for the three Services is given in Annex I, Table 2.finance.   The estimated cost of the defence programme is:  million(a) as estimated for 1960-61      ......      ...      1,616-33*(b) as estimated for 1961-62      .......      ...      1,655-60The figure for 1960-61 is before taking account of a German contribution of the deutschmark equivalent of  12 million towards the local costs of british forces in Germany.5.
