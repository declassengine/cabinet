CUMSNT 12 THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC   MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT)-0 7CjiUJii COPY NO.    v^7 j:h March, 1961CABINETECONOMIC SURVEY, 1961Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Economic Policy Committee agreed on 9th Ma-ch to deletefrom the Economic Survey three paragraphs designed to refute the critics who say that the Government       by  their stop-start decisions are the real cause for stagnating production.Upon reflection, I think it is for consideration whether the endof paragraph 23 of the print circulated to the Cabinet (C. (6l) 37) is toolaconic as it stands and whether something on the lines of the originalparagraphs should be reinstated.Attached is the draft of two new paragraphs which I proposeshould be inserted after paragraph 23.S. L.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.20th March, 1961
ANNEXProposer; now paragraphs24.     The fact that from time to time the Government act to restraindemand is not a contradiction of this general policy of encouragingeconomic growth.   It is, on the contrary, a necessary part of this general policy.   If the balance of payments were to deterioratecontinuously because of excessive internal demand, the results in the end would be far more damaging to the country, and at the sametime to business confidence and to industrial development, than ifmoderate action were taken in good time.     The Government do notbelieve that, as things are, running the economy with greater pressure on demand than at present would in fact increase the rate of growthsubstantially even in the short run.   For such a policy could not becontinued without affecting the stability of sterling internally andexternally, thus reacting on the climate for investment, and withoutjeopardizing the achievement of the most urgent economic objective -the expansion of exports.25.     The Government believe that the measures taken in recentyears to influence the level of demand have made conditions more andnot less stable than they would otherwise have  been.   nevertheless the recognise the desirability of having a higher and steadier rate of growth, provided that this can be done without risk to the balance ofpayments, in order to encourage the sense of security and confidence in the future which are so important for business development.March, 1961
