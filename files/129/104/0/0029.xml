ANNEXRECORD OF REMARKS MADE BY THE LORD PRIVY SEAL AT THEMEETING OF THE COUNCIL OF THE WESTERN european union, PARIS,   27th  FEBRUARY,   1961Assembly Recommendation No. 53Mr. Heath had been very glad that Recommendation No. 53 should have beenplaced on the agenda, since this would provide an opportunity for a thoroughdiscussion of the question of European unity in its widest aspect, political as wellas economic. Though this question had been raised so many times in so many places over the past years, never before had it been thoroughly discussed in theWestern European Union Council. He therefore welcomed a substantialexamination on the present occasion.The widespread interest in the subject was not confined to Governments;public opinion, and also parliamentary circles, were closely concerned with it, as was shown by the almost unanimous adoption of Recommendation No. 53 at thelast Session of the Assembly.Mr. Heath wished to take this opportunity of making a full and frankstatement of the United Kingdom Governments views on the matter. He would greatly welcome in return an expression of the views of his colleagues. he proposed to take the text of Recommendation No. 53 as a convenient basis forhis statement, though his remarks would cover a wider field.Recommendation No. 53 covered three points:(a) Britain&apos;s relations with the European Economic Community.(b) Britain&apos;s relations with the other two communities (European Coal andSteel Community and Euratom).(c) Political consultation in Europe, in a rather special context.(a) Britain&apos;s Relations with the European Economic community in the Western European Union Council, discussions were always carried onagainst the background of the world situation as a whole, such as the challengeof the East, increased threats to the West in such places as Laos and the Congo,the coming challenge in Germany over Berlin, disarmament, the evolution of theUnited Nations and the attack on the Secretary-General, the direction in whichthe newly-emergent nations would look in the future, &amp;c. All these problemsserved to emphasise the vital need for unity in Europe.Against this background, the United Kingdom Government were very muchin tune with the anxieties expressed by the Assembly and therefore welcomed the irrecommendation. His Government agreed with them that Britain was anessential part of Europe and &quot; should participate fully and jointly with the other member States in the development of European unity &quot; (cf. first paragraph of recommendation No. 53). They were ready to play their part. The developmentof two separate economic groups in Europe was bound to hamper the expansionof production and trade in Western Europe and lead to a wasteful use of resources,in particular in investment. This must bring about, sooner or later, ill-feelingwhich, in its turn, would have political consequences detrimental to european unity. The British Government had, therefore, been bending their efforts overthe past year to finding a solution.However, because they realised that another breakdown, such as had takenplace in 1958, would be disastrous, they had not wished to start any formalnegotiations until they could be reasonably certain that a real basis for a successful outcome existed. They had as a result been seeking over the past five months a fresh approach which could provide such a basis for negotiation.The Council would recall that the United Kingdom Prime Minister had seenChancellor Adenauer, President Fanfani and General de Gaulle. Mr. Heathhimself had had opportunities of discussing these matters with his six colleagues and he was most grateful to them for their help and guidance. Furthermore, theUnited Kingdom Government had discussed the problem with the commonwealth finance Ministers in September, and had kept in touch with the Ministers of the58599
European Free Trade Association. Finally, there had been informal andexploratory talks with German and Italian officials, and now similar talks with french experts were starting in London. They welcomed these talks.The results so far were reasonably encouraging; a good deal of common ground had been found, and there now existed an understanding of the UnitedKingdom point of view.During these informal talks, a number of points had been made on the UnitedKingdom side, which formed the basis of their new approach to the problem.The main one was that if the Six could meet their Commonwealth and agriculturaldifficulties, the United Kingdom could then consider a system based on a commonor harmonised tariff on raw materials and manufactured goods imported from countries other than the Seven or the Commonwealth.Mr. Heath stressed that this represented a fundamental change of principle in the United Kingdom position since never before had they envisaged adopting a common tariff. He hoped that this would be recognised as a major contributionto the solution of the problem.Mr Heath added that his Government also visualised special arrangements fortropical and agricultural products, because they believed that this was important not only for economic reasons, but also to prevent an extension of the division ofEurope into Africa, and particularly into the newly emergent territories there.In addition, in response to German and Italian enquiries at their talks, theUnited Kingdom Government had made it clear that, as part of an overallsettlement, they would see no difficulty of principle in the way of discussions between the Six and the Commonwealth countries concerning possible reductions in the tariff preferences which the United Kingdom now enjoyed in those countries.This too was an important point.As regards method, his Government had suggested that the best approach was to start by isolating the individual technical problems and trying to findsolutions for each of them. That is to say, to look at the major groups of commodities one by one, and see what the requirements were for each country.When that had been done, it would be easier to see what sort of framework wouldbe required to cover the agreed arrangements.Recommendation No. 53 proposed that the United Kingdom should accede to the European Economic Community as a full member. The United KingdomGovernment did not wish at present to express a view on this, chiefly becausethey could not see clearly what their general relationship with the Six would beuntil they had learned more from them about their attitude to these problems.His Government was therefore keeping an open mind on this question. Theyfully recognised that common institutions would be necessary to control a commonor harmonised tariff. They accepted this and were not afraid of any suchinstitutions. He must however stress that no arrangements would be satisfactory to his Government which did not involve a political as well as an economicrelationship with the Six.Mr. Heath went on to make it clear that in all these discussions hisGovernment had been speaking for themselves alone and that they had no mandatefrom their partners in the European Free Trade Association. However, theyhad always said that the interests of these partners must be safeguarded; these interests had therefore been borne very much in mind, and their partners had been kept fully informed. The recent European Free Trade Association Councilcommunique showed that the United Kingdom Government had the firm supportof their partners there in what had been done, and also demonstrated the latter&apos;sreadiness and will to work for a solution.As regards the Commonwealth, the United Kingdom had every hope that anarrangement on the lines mentioned would be acceptable to them. Of course,further discussion would be necessary, but the countries of the Commonwealthrecognised the importance of European unity. Mr. Heath recalled that theirPrime Ministers were to meet in 10 days&apos; time, when these views would doubtless be confirmed.Summing up on this point, Mr. Heath considered that the series ofexplorations and informal exchanges should be continued until it was possible tosee clearly enough ahead to justify more formal negotiations. But they could not,of course, give away their full negotiating position now.
He did not claim that his Governments approach was a revolutionary one;he did maintain however that it was the sensible way to proceed and he hoped theCouncil would share this view.(b) Britain&apos;s Relations with the other Two Communities (European Coal and steel community and Euratom)Mr. Heath recalled that the second part of Recommendation No. 53 suggestednegotiations with a view to British accession to both these communities at the sametime as to the European Economic Community. He thought his Government&apos;views on this proposal were well known.In June 1960, Mr. Profumo had told the Assembly that in the context of a wider economic arrangement, the United Kingdom would be ready to consider any proposal for joining these two communities. At their June meeting, theCouncil had decided to remit this question to an ad hoc group meeting in London;this group had duly met, and the United Kingdom had asked three questions concerning the interpretation of the Euratom Treaty, which were still outstanding;they would welcome their friends&apos; views on them.He feared that his Governments purposes in this matter had been somewhatmisunderstood. It had apparently been thought that the United Kingdom were trying to get something for nothing and to impede the linking up of the threeCommunities. He could not say too strongly that this was not at all the case.On the contrary, his Government had intended to demonstrate their desire to comecloser to their European Allies since they looked on all these matters as partsof the central problem, which was to keep Europe united.(c) Political Consultation in Europe ,Mr. Heath wished first to make a general statement of principle. The UnitedKingdom Government had no desire whatever to weaken the ties of the Six-PowerCommunity or to dilute or impede the flow of this great European Organisationtowards greater forms of unity.They understood very clearly the impulsions and historic necessities whichlay behind this movement; he himself had tried to explain in his country the momentum which it had gained and there was now widespread unstanding of it. The United Kingdom had too great an interest in seeing it prosper totolerate any policy of obstruction to it. They recognised it as a real force whichthey understood and accepted. They sought therefore to take part in it, to fulfil,to enlarge and strengthen it, and not to dilute it.He then divided the question into four main heads :(i) The United Kingdom recognised, of course, that political discussions between the Six relating to, or arising from, the business of the communities, were the sole concern of the Six Governments. TheUnited Kingdom would not be entitled, nor would they expect, to take part in such discussions unless or until they had joined, or formed someassociation with, the Communities.They had no wish to see the identity of the Communities weakenedwhile a solution of their relationship with them was being sought.They were not trying to force their way into meetings where they didnot have the same responsibilities as the other participants.(ii) On the other hand, when an acceptable arrangement with the Six-PowerCommunities was reached, the United Kingdom would not be afraid of the resulting institutions. They would expect to participate in themto the full extent required by the arrangements agreed upon.(iii) In the meantime, when political discussions took place on broad european and world-wide problems in which the United Kingdom were also concerned, they were interested, and his Government believed , that theUnited Kingdom should participate. He considered that the western countries would run into very great dangers, both in Europe and in theworld as a whole, if they could not concentrate and organise their discussions so as to unite their policies and strengthen their alliances.Until such time as the relationship of the United Kingdom andthe Six on the economic and political planes had been settled, he considered that the Western European Union Council, which was, after
all, the European nucleus from which the North Atlantic Alliance hadsprung, could provide the forum for any necessary discussion of broadEuropean problems. He thought it was a matter for regret that theWestern European Union had not been more fully used in the past,and recalled in this connexion the recent statement of ChancellorAdenauer. The United Kingdom Government had always been veryready to use the Western European Union more extensively, and thepresent discussions could be a beginning of most fruitful exchanges ofview.He wished, however, to stress that the British Government wouldnot like to be excluded from European discussions of political questions in which they had a direct interest, such as East-West relations, thepolitical future of Europe, questions of security and disarmament,relations with other continents, and so on. He did not think anyonecould deny that they had an important contribution to make to such discussions, and that it would be damaging to European, as well as towider Western interests, if there were any growth of divergenciesbetween the United Kingdom and other European countries on such issues.Political consultations could take many forms. Sometimes theycould require decisions to be taken in common, for exampleconsultations in the North Atlantic Alliance about problems of East-West relations. In this case, it was necessary to reach agreement andformulate a united policy.At other times, the object of such consultations was to exchangeviews and build up a body of understanding so that policies could beharmonised as much as possible. If a Europe was to be built up whichwas capable of carrying the weight and influence to which it was entitled by the skills and energies of its peoples, the allies must pooltheir ideas and efforts to the utmost extent.(iv) Mr. Heath then turned to the third part of Recommendation No. 53,which related to a possible Conference of Heads of Governments andthe question of the United Kingdom Prime Minister taking part. Hethought it would be clear from what he had already said how hisGovernment regarded the general question of their participation ininstitutions, meetings and discussions, what their attitude to thissuggestion would be. He could only repeat what the Prime minister himself had said in the House of Commons, namely, that if the UnitedKingdom were to receive a unanimous invitation from the Six to jointhem in such meetings, they would be disposed to accept it.In conclusion, Mr. Heath hoped that if anyone still harboureddoubts about the United Kingdom will to find a solution to this problem, these doubts had now been dispelled. Furthermore, ifanyone questioned the ability of the United Kingdom to make asettlement, Mr. Heath hoped he had demonstrated that they had takenfirm steps towards this such as had never been taken previously.They could not do this, however, in isolation. It would thereforebe helpful to have some indication whether, in the view of their allies,they were travelling along the right path and whether all had the sameend in view.The United Kingdom purpose was to reach a fair settlement whichthey believed could be mutually advantageous to all, both economically and politically. This would involve adjustments by both sides ;^ theUnited Kingdom Government were prepared for this, and they had the will and the ability to reach it.February, 1961.
