t.o/y/6/       confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1961Copy No.   32C. (61) 720th January, 1961CABINETTEACHERS&apos; salaries memorandum by the Paymaster-GeneralThe Wages Committee have considered a proposal by the Minister ofEducation concerning the attitude which the Government should adopt towards a claim by teachers for an increase of about 30 per cent, in salaries from an earlydate in 1961. The claim is for a 10-year basic scale of  700- l,300, compared withthe existing 17-year scale of  520- l,000. The annual cost of such an increase,without taking account of consequential improvements, would be  89 millions.About 55-60 per cent, of the additional expenditure would have to be providedby the Exchequer through the general grant to local authorities.2 The present salary scales came into effect on 1st October, 1959. in approving the Burnham Committee&apos;s report, July 1959, the then Minister ofEducation underlined the importance of their proposal that the settlement should remain in force for at least two and a half years, i.e., to 31st March, 1962. Thereport included a provision that either side of the Committee might give not lessthan one year&apos;s notice to terminate the operation of the scales on 31st March inany year from 1962 onwards. The Teachers&apos; Panel have now given notice to terminate the present salary agreement, but have also asked for the immediateopening of negotiations for new scales to operate as early as possible in 1961. TheLocal Authorities&apos; Panel are due to meet on 26th January to consider the teachers&apos;request, and a meeting of the Burnham Committee itself is expected early next month.3. There are precedents for a revision of teachers&apos; salaries, whether by an interim increase or a new report, during the currency of an existing agreement, but such increases have in the past been sought on the basis of rises in the cost of living.At present the teachers have no good case on such grounds, but they can point to considerable disturbances in salary relativities as a result mainly of increases for civil service executive officers (15 per cent, at the bottom and 9 per cent, at the top of the basic scale), local government officers (6-7 per cent.), nurses (5 per cent.), andthe recent rise in police pay (30 per cent, and upwards).4. It is the general policy of the Ministry of Education to keep in informaltouch with the local authorities&apos; side, and it is desirable that the Government shouldbe able to give an informal indication of their views before the local authorities,at their meeting on.26th January, decide on the line they will take in negotiation.The alternative courses appear to be:(a) to stand firm on the present agreement up to March 1962;(b) to grant an interim increase in salaries (say 5 per cent, from 1st April, 1961),1 pending negotiation of a new settlement to operate from April 1962;(c) to agree to start negotiations for a new settlement, but to make it clear at the outset that the new arrangements should not operate from an earlier date than, say, 1st January, 1962.58371
2CONFIDENTIAL5. As regards (a), there is a good case for insisting that the teachers shouldhonour the existing agreement. The Wages Committee were, however, informedthat some representatives on the Local Authorities&apos; Panel were likely to be in favourof negotiating a new settlement effective from an earlier date than April 1962. Ifa majority of the Local Authorities&apos; Panel were to support the teachers&apos; demands,all the odium of resisting them would fall on the Government. This might havedifficult political implications in view of the considerable salary increases in other fields, and the Committee came to the conclusion that it would be unwise to insist on adherence to the existing agreement.6. The Committee thought that alternative (b) should also be rejected. First,the Government would be seen to be acquiescing in the curtailment by a whole year of the standstill in teachers&apos; pay which was part of the present agreement. Secondly,the payment of an interim increase &quot; across the board &quot; to all teachers wouldrestrict the room for manoeuvre in subsequent negotiations. Thirdly, an interim increase could not be justified on cost-of-living grounds.7. The Committee were agreed that alternative (c) was the best course tofollow in all the circumstances. It would go some way to placate present feelingsamong teachers if the Local Authorities&apos; Panel were to say that in presentcircumstances they were agreed that a full negotiation for a new report wasnecessary. In the view of the Minister of Education the complexities of such a negotiation are such that it would be unlikely that any new Burnham report couldbe brought into force before October 1961. The Committee were of the opinionthat in the circumstances the Governments attitude should be that they would not object to the holding of a full negotiation for a new report, on the understandingthat it would not come into force on an earlier date than 1st January, 1962. Thiscourse had the advantage of not curtailing the currency of the existing agreement by more than a few months.8. Since the meeting of the Wages Committee, the Secretary of the LocalAuthorities&apos; Panel has confirmed that a majority of the Panel are likely to be inifavour of a new settlement to operate from an earlier date than April 1962, andthat there appears to be a fair chance that they would agree to 1st January, 1962.He emphasised, however, that it was important to settle the operative date withthe Teachers&apos; Panel before the substantive negotiations began; and that it was mostprobable that an approach would be made to the Minister of Education by the burnham Committee for his approval of a proposed date if agreement on it couldbe reached, or for his views if there were deadlock between the two sides.recommendation . The Wages Committee therefore recommend the Cabinet to approve thecourse outlined in paragraph 7.M.Office of the Paymaster General, S.W. 1,20th January, 1961.
