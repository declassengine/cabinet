Printed for the Cabinet.   March 1961*-----------C. (61) 34 Copy No.   3210th March, 1961CABINETFACILITIES FOR THE FEDERAL GERMAN forces memorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 16th February the Cabinet invited me to consider, in consultation withthe Minister of Defence, whether, if facilities were given to German units to training this country, it would be necessary to extend to Germany the Visiting forces act, 1952, and the Application of Law Order made under the Act (C.C. (61)7th Conclusions, Minute 6).  This memorandum sets out our conclusions.2. While the position of individual members of the German forces who come here to train in our own Service units does not require any special legislative provision, there are a number of considerations which make it impracticable to invite an organised body of German troops to this country without extending theAct and the Order to Germany. The Visiting Forces Act and Order are devised to cover the numerous administrative matters which must be settled if an armed force of one country is to function efficiently as a self-contained and disciplinedbody in the territory of another country. It is therefore desirable and indeednecessary, in our own interests as much as in those of a visiting force, that someat least of the various privileges which they confer should be granted to any german force which came to this country, and it is difficult to envisage the presenceof a body of foreign troops in this country which did not enjoy some visiting forcesfacilities. For example, the exercise of service discipline is made lawful bysection 2 of the Act; without it a visiting force could not discipline its members,and would have no defence if a soldier under arrest or detention applied forhabeas corpus. Again, the Application of Law Order extends to a visiting forcevarious Crown exemptions and immunities enjoyed by our own forces. without them a German force in this country would be in the same position, in spite of its military purpose, as .a group of private citizens; for example, its members wouldhave to apply to a chief constable for firearm certificates, and would be subject tothe same restrictions on the use of arms, ammunition and explosives as any other person. In short, a unit operating under these conditions would soon cease to bea proper military force.3. The considerations set out above apply to any defence facilities afforded to the Germans which would involve the presence of German forces in this countryfor purposes of training, and they apply to some extent to facilities which wouldinvolve the presence of organised bodies of German forces in this country forother purposes e.g., accompanying ships or aircraft which came here for maintenance.4. But even if we were able to give the Germans a substantial part of thefacilities they seek without extending the Act to Germany, it must be rememberedthat Germany is already a full member of the North Atlantic Alliance, andA moreover extends to our forces in Germany greater privileges and facilities than we confer on visiting forces who come to this country. She would justifiably takeoffence if we took no steps to confer on German troops who came to this country the privileges and facilities which our law allows. Furthermore, while we have at present no treaty obligation to confer visiting forces privileges on german forces, such an obligation &quot;would at once arise when Germany ratified the Status58651THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT
of Forces Agreement reached by the North Atlantic Alliance (and no doubt weshould then be pressed to honour it whether or not German forces were to cometo this country). We should look foolish if we let German forces come here with no special status, but then had to extend the Act and Order to Germany a fewmonths later when German ratification of the Agreement took effect. To do thiswould offend Germany without avoiding domestic political trouble.s; sr*5. I understand that it emerged clearly from recent talks with the Germansboth that they are anxious to take up this year our offer of training facilities, andthat, owing to their prior need to complete their ratification of the newSupplementary Agreement on Allied Forces in Germany, there is little prospectof German acoession to the Status of Forces Agreement before the end of this year.The inevitable conclusion is that, unless we are to withdraw the offer which we havemade to the Germans, we must go ahead with extending the Visiting Forces Actand Application of Law Order to Germany in advance of her accession to the status of Forces Agreement, notwithstanding any additional opposition which (as I suggested in my earlier paper (C. (61)12)) the Orders /may encounter on this account. I understand that the German Government have agreed to give a writtenundertaking that they will apply the provisions of the Status of Forces agreement to their troops who come here, pending their formal accession to the Agreement.If my colleagues agree, I propose to set in train forthwith the preparation of thenecessary Application of Law Order, which will be submitted to legislation committee in due course.6. The Minister of Defence and the Foreign Secretary concur with the views expressed in this memorandum.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,10th March, 1961.
