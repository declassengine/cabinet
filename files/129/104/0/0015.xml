DOCUMENT JL THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C. (61) 152nd February, 1961COFY NOCABINETROAD TRAVEL EXPENSES OF PEERS and members OF parliament memorandum by the Chancellor jf the ExchequerLast summer my predecessor circulated a paper, C.(6u) 95,describing a scheme, prepared at the instance of the Opposition, forpermitting Peers and Members of Parliament to claim refund of expenses for car journeys for the types of journey for which they cannow obtain rail vouchers.   (A small amendment of existing arrangementsfor Peers&apos; air travel was also proposed, to bring both Houses into line.)     The paper was not discussed since, at the last moment, as was reported to Cabinet on 23rd June the Opposition changed their minds (C. C.(60) 37th Conclusions, Minute 1).   On the same day thePrime Minister informed the House that the scheme could not be proceeded with in the absence of general agreement.2.     I now understand from the Chief Whip that the Opposition have again changed their minds.   The Home Secretary and I are agreed that,in consequence, the proposals can now be reintroduced.    We suggest,however, that the scheme described in C.(60) 95 might be amended toaPplyj not to all private cars as previously envisaged, but only tocars owned by Members or their wives.   This should meet some ofthe fear, alleged to have been felt by the Opposition, that the schemewas open to abuse.   I therefore propose that the Chief V\Thip beauthorised to discuss the scheme on this basis with the Opposition,with a view to its introduction at the beginning of the next financialyear.S. L.Treasury Chambers, 3.W.I.2nd February, 1961
