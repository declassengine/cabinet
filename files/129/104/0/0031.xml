confidential D0CuMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)$    CJ.61L312nd March, 1961COPY NC._2CABINETMALTAMemorandum by the AttorneyOn 28th February, 19,61, the Cabinet invited me to consider whetherthe proposals in the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum (C. (6l) 26)would give Malta &quot;independent&quot; status for the purposes of internationallaw (C. C. (6l) 10th Conclusions, Minute 5)2.        According to the law and custom, of nations a State is recognised as fully sovereign only if it has inter alia control of its external relations and a sovereign government.   Under the Blood Constitution the Maltesewill have neither.I am accordingly of the opinion that the implementation of theColonial Secretary&apos;s proposals would not confer on Malta the status ofan independent sovereign State.   Foreign countries would not thereforebe entitled to regard Malta, as having that status.3.        I understand it v/as suggested at the meeting of the Cabinet thatthe enactment by the Maltese legislature of a law proclaiming independencefor Malta might provoke unfriendly governments to recognise Malta asan independent sovereign State.   I find some difficulty in appreciatinghow such a lav/ could be enacted in view of the power of the Governor to reserve for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure any Bill which affects or appears to affect the discharge by the Government of the United Kingdom of its responsibilities for defence and external affairs.   The mere passing ofsuch a Bill.by the Maltese legislature would not have any legal effect and would not in law afford any justification for the recognition of Maltaas an independent sovereign State by an unfriendly government.4.        I understand it has been suggested that a contrary view could bebased on an Opinion given to the Government of the Federation of rhodesia and Ny as aland by Sir Ivor Jennings.   In this Opinion (which has beenconsidered by the Daw Officers in another context)  Sir Ivor expressedthe view that any colony enjoying representative government has, vis-a-vis the Government and Parliament of the United Kingdom, the same con-stitutional position as was enjoyed by the Dominions immediately beforethe enactment of the Statute of Westminster in 1931.   In my opinion, that view is wrong;  bttt it has in any event no bearing on the relationship between colonies and fully sovereign States.   Even if it were right, itwould not, therefore, support the argument.R. E. M-E.Law Officers&apos; Department, W.C.2.2nd March, 1961
