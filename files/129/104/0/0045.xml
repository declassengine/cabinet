Thiswas promised by the Leader of the House on 26th July, 1960, and its form and content are on the lines which he indicated on that occasion and which I somewhatamplified during the Debate on the Public Investment White Paper on10th November, 1960. I propose to present this White Paper on Tuesday,11th April, or Wednesday, 12th April.2. The White Paper contains nothing new in the sense that there is nothing init which has not been previously available in published form. It is, however, thefirst time that a full account of Government lending, together with summaries of the relevant statutory provisions, has been brought together in one document. It willalso be the first time that estimates of lending in the forthcoming financial year havebeen published before Budget Day.3. The White Paper is intended as a reference document, and its drafting hasbeen kept factual and non-controversial. I do not think that it should prove necessary to have it discussed in Cabinet. If, however, any of my colleagues wishes to send me any comments on it, I should be most grateful if he would do so beforethe evening of Tuesday, 28th March.S.

GOVERNMENT EXPENDITURE BELOW THE LINEINTRODUCTIONBackground1. This White Paper carries out the undertaking given by the Leader ofthe House on 26th July, 1960, that the Government would publish information about Government lending below the line in more detail than hitherto and the subsequent undertaking by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the debate on the Public Investment White Paper on 10th November, 1960, thatthis White Paper would also show how the investment of the nationalised industries was being financed. For the sake of completeness, this White Paperalso includes information about below the line transactions which do not fall into the category of Government lending, but which for various reasons areborne below the line, rather than above it, on Votes.Government Aid to Private industry. The White Paper sets out the details of loans made below the line to private industry and other bodies. It does not give details of assistanceprovided above the line on Votes. This information is summarised in thesection on Loans to Private Industry and the details will, as stated by theFinancial Secretary to the Treasury on 9th February, 1961, be published inthe Financial Secretary&apos;s Memorandum on the 1961-62 Estimates for theCivil and Revenue Departments, to be published on Budget Day.Composition of Expenditure Below the line. Most below the line expenditure consists of repayable loans made undervarious Acts. The largest of these are the loans to the nationalised industries.Next are the loans to other public authorities. A third category comprisesloans to private industry. The fourth distinct group consists of loans for overseas assistance. The remaining below the line expenditure falls into two groups. The first is expenditure arising from war-time liabilities, i.e., war damage payments, post-war refunds of excess profits tax, and repayment of post-war credits. The second group mainly comprises advances for centralgovernment expenditure v/here the common feature is the desire to spreadout the capital payments concerned over a period of years. In these cases,the enabling statute provides that the amount issued out of the consolidate fund should be repaid by Vote provision over a specified period. The loans for married quarters for the Armed Forces come within this category.4. Subsequent paragraphs describe below the line expenditure in more detail.Figures are given for the years 1958-59 to 1961-62. The information aboutthe financing of capital expenditure by the nationalised industries thus covers the same period as that in the recent White Paper on Public Investment (Cmnd.1203). The Appendix summarises total expenditure below the line in theperiod under review.5&apos;&apos;
INTEREST CHARGED ON BELOW THE LINE ADVANCES5. Most of the repayable advances made below the line are made at ratesrelated to those at which the Government can itself borrow for the periodconcerned at the time the advance is made although in a few cases, e.g., Ex-chequer loans to building societies and Public Works Loan Board advances to local authorities, interest is charged on a different basis described in the relevant paragraphs below.6. Each issue from the Consolidated Fund under the statutory powersdescribed in this paper results in a corresponding increase in the National Debt,thereby increasing the interest charge on the National Debt. The statutes,therefore, provide that the interest received on repayable advances from the consolidated Fund shall be applied to the payment of an equivalent amount ofinterest on the National Debt. This transaction appears as the first item belowthe line on both sides of the published Exchequer Accounts.LOANS TO THE NATIONALISED INDUS FRIESBackground7. In the three years to 31st March, 1961, nearly three-quarters of thetotal net issues below the line have consisted of loans to the nationalised industries. These issues stem from the statutory powers of the industries to borrow for capital purposes and the statutory power of the Exchequer to lendto them through the appropriate Minister for these purposes.8. Because their financial arrangements and borrowing powers vary so much from one industry to another it is not possible to construct a single simplestatement covering loans to the nationalised industries as a whole. Theposition of each individual industry has therefore been described in some detail in the paragraphs which follow, while Tables I and II give a consolidatedsummary which is as comprehensive as is possible when bringing togetherfigures which are not all strictly comparable one with another.Borrowing Powers of the Nationalised Industries9. Table I gives details of the borrowing powers (including temporaryborrowing) of each of the industries at present and of the new arrangements ofthe Post Office. The normal pattern of these Bon owing Acts is that they make provision for the expected requirements of the industry for a period of from-6 years, divided into two parts by an intermediate limit which may not be exceeded without the passing of an Affirmative Resolution of the House ofCommons.10. These arrangements give Parliament the power to review and control the borrowing of the nationalised industries every two or three years. Thisinterval, which was formerly longer, has emerged over the years from a variety of considerations. The shape and size of the investment programmes of theindustries, which are important factors in determining the level of their borrow-ings, have to be settled generally several years in advance: and the industries
seek the approval of the Minister and the necessary statutory borrowing powersaccordingly. Moreover, the extent to which the industries need to borrow inany one year to finance their investment depends on their trading fortunes,which cannot be firmly predicted. On the other hand, there were arguments against the infrequency of occasions for effective Parliamentary control of the borrowing of these industries and especially of those among them which areencountering financial difficulties. In the Govemmenfs view the present arrangements provide a practical way of reconciling the need for parliamentary control with the desirability of giving these large trading undertakings areasonable degree of assurance about the future and a reasonable degree of flexibility in the management of their businesses and their finances.The Power of the Exchequer to Lend11. In the case of the National Coal Board the nationalising statute and extending legislation enables the Exchequer, through the Minister of Power,to finance the National Coal Board within the limits of the Coal Board&apos;sborrowing powers. The power of the Exchequer to lend through the appro-priate Minister to the other industries excluding the Post Office was firstgranted by Section 42 of the Finance Act, 1956, for a period of two years.This power was extended in subsequent Finance Acts. Section 78 of theFinance Act, 1960, increased the total amount which the Exchequer mightissue for this purpose up to the end of August, 1961, to  2,050 million and provided that in each of the two subsequent years there would be such furtheraddition to these powers to lend within the total powers of the industries to borrow, as might be prescribed by an Order made by the Treasury. This order is subject to an Affirmative Resolution of the House of Commons. The Sectionspecifies a single maximum amount for all industries except the National coal board and the Post Office: the limit relates to the total amount lent and notto the amount outstanding, which is the basis adopted in the various BorrowingActs. The period covered begins in August, immediately after the finance bill becomes law. For these reasons the maximum figure prescribed inthe Finance Act is not readily reconcilable with the aggregate borrowing powers of the industries or with the estimates of borrowing for the financialyear which are shown in the present White Paper.12. The power of the Exchequer to lend through the appropriate Ministerto the nationalised industries is maintained primarily to facilitate management of the national debt: it has to be distinguished from the control over the powersof the industries to borrow which is imposed in their Borrowing Acts. Ifthe power of the Exchequer to lend were withdrawn it would be necessary to revert to the system of stock issues, and to go over to it in the case of the PostOffice and the National Coal Board. As explained in the White Paper onthe Financial and Economic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries (Cmnd.), the financial position of these industries the extent to which the Govern-ment is already and irrevocably involved in their finances, and the problemsof debt management, make it impractical to contemplate any such change inthe near future.

They include a total of  1,620 million inrespect of outstanding stock issued before the introduction of the system of Exchequerfinancing in 1956.(c) The National Coal Board may also not borrow in any financial year more than  50million over and above its maximum level of borrowings in the previous financial year withoutthe authority of an affirmative resolution of the House of Commons.(d) The figures for the British Transport Commission exclude the separate and additionalpower to borrow  400 million under the Transport (Railway Finances) Act, 1957, and theTransport (Borrowing Powers) Act, 1959, to meet the revenue deficits of British Railways.13. Table II gives a breakdown of the figures of total outstanding borrowingof the nationalised industries in Table I. The figures include borrowing bystock issues, advances from the Exchequer and temporary borrowing. Theyexclude compensation stock issued following nationalisation and subsequentadjustments between the Electricity Council and its predecessors and theScottish Electricity Boards. They also exclude the British Transport Corn-mission^ borrowing to meet revenue deficits.

The former arrangements for financing the Post Office under the PostOffice Money Acts authorised the Treasury to lend to the Post Office out ofthe Consolidated Fund to finance its capital expenditure. These advanceswere shown as Appropriations-in-Aid in the Post Office&apos;s annual Estimates(Vote Rev. 3). Under the new arrangements for financing the Post Officelaid down in the Post Office Act, the Post Office will continue to draw finance for capital expenditure from the Exchequer, on much the same basis as the nationalised industries. The limit of the Post Office&apos;s indebtedness to theExchequer is fixed by Section 10 of the Post Office Act at  880 million, includingoutstanding indebtedness to the Exchequer estimated at approximately  800million on 31st March, 1961. This limit can be raised to  960 million by aResolution of the House of Commons. In addition the Post Office may tem-temporarily borrow from the Bank of England sums not exceeding  30 million at any one time.15. Up to the end of 1960-61 Post Office depreciation provisions have been applied towards expenditure on fixed capital, the remainder required for thispurpose being advanced under the Money Acts. Working capital requirements have been financed from Vote. Surpluses earned each year have been allowedto accumulate as a General Reserve (held by the Exchequer on behalf of thePost Office) instead of being invested in the business. In 1961-62 it is planned to meet the whole of Post Office requirements, for both fixed and working capital, as far as possible from internal resources including the surplus. Thebalance would be met from below the line advances. The figures in Table IIIare all constructed for ease of comparison as if the arrangements proposed for 1961-62 had applied throughout the four-year period.
16. Repayment will be on a debenture basis so that sums will fall due for repayment (or renewal at revised interest rates) after a term of years determined in advance. This arrangement will apply not only to future borrowings butalso to the initial debt at 31st March, 1961. This will be sub-divided for repayment purposes into 25 equal debentures maturing at annual intervalscommencing at 31st March, 1962.Loans to the National Coal Board17. As already mentioned, the Coal Board has been able to borrow fromthe Exchequer for capital purposes ever since it was set up. The statu-tory authority for its Exchequer borrowing is Sections 26 and 34 of the CoalIndustry Nationalisation Act, 1946, which authorise the Minister of Power tomake advances to the National Coal Board, within certain limits, and to defraycapital expenditure of the Board, including the provision of working capital,and empower the Treasury to issue the necessary sums to the Minister.18. The current borrowing powers of the Coal Board are governed by section of the Coal Industry Act, 1960. This provides that within the period ending31st December, 1965, outstanding Exchequer loans may not at any time exceed 700 million or such greater sum not exceeding  750 million as the Minister may specify by Order. In addition the Coal Board may, with the permission of theMinister, borrow without Treasury Guarantee up to  20 million from the banksunder Section 27 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946, as amended in 1951.19. Since the Minister provides the Board&apos;s working capital, they do not normally carry balances with their bankers. From the outset the Board&apos;financial arrangements have been such that seasonal or short-term fluctuationsare reflected in the Ministers advances. The Board borrow their short-term requirements from the Minister and any temporary cash surpluses are repaidto him and transferred by him to the Exchequer. Only the net change in the outstanding total advances counts against the statutory limits.20. The Coal Board&apos;s liability for all compensation costs at the time of nationalisation is to the Minister. The annual repayments made by the board in respect of this liability are also repaid to the Minister and transferred byhim to the Exchequer. But, in this case, the sum transferred reduces netExchequer advances without reducing the Board&apos;s borrowing against thestatutory limits.Loans to the British Transport Commission to meet revenue deficits21. For the years 1956-57 to 1959-60, the British Transport Commissionborrowed from the Exchequer to meet its revenue deficit as well as on capital account under Section 42 of the Finance Act, 1956. Section 1 of the Transport(Railway Finances) Act, 1957, extended the borrowing powers of the british transport Commission to cover the net revenue deficit in the years 1956 to 1962,subject to a maximum of  250 million for the period as a whole. Under the Act,these borrowings could only be from the Minister: the Commission were alsoempowered to borrow from the Minister for a period of years the interestpayable on the deficit borrowings. The limit of  250 million on the deficitborrowings themselves was subsequently increased to  400 million under the
Transport (Borrowing Powers) Act, 1959. The then Chancellor of the Ex-chequer announced in his 1960 Budget speech that in the next financial year theBritish Transport Commission^ revenue deficit and the interest on previousdeficit advances would be financed above the line in recognition of the factthat the prospects of the railways were likely to make them unable to repay the money previously borrowed to meet the deficit. Money was subsequentlyvoted by Parliament to cover the 1960 deficit and an Estimate for the financing of the 1961 deficit in the same way has been presented to Parliament. (TheMinister makes advances to cover the British Transport Commission^ ne trevenue deficit three months in arrear and the sum voted in a financial yeartherefore covers the deficit in the corresponding calendar year.) Deficit loansunder the 1957 and 1959 Acts have now therefore ceased. The Government^proposals for the future financial structure of the British Transport commission were given in the White Paper, &quot; Reorganisation of the Nationalised transport undertakings,&quot; Cmnd. 1248.Nationalised Industries: Financing of Capital Requirements22. The White Paper on Public Investment in Great Britain (Cmnd. 1203)(paragraphs 15 to 41) gave details of the investment programmes for these industries. The following tables show how this investment was financed in1958-59 to 1960-61, and how the estimated investment is expected to be financed in 1961-62. Differences from the investment programmes as shownin the Public Investment White Paper are explained in footnotes to the tables.TABLE HIPost Office: Financing Of Capital Requirements  million	1958-59	1959-60	1960-61 (estimate)	1961-62 (forecast)				Expenditure on fixed assets* Changes in working capital	95-8 (-)4-2	100-7 (-)6-5	104 4	106 5Total Capital Requirements ...	91-6	94-2	108	111Financed by:f Internal Resources &apos;    ......

Figures for expenditure on nuclear fuel are usually subject to considerable variation depending on the incidence ofpayments to the Atomic Energy Authority.t These compare with figures of  304-4 million and  13-6 million shown in Cmnd. 1203for expenditure on fixed assets and nuclear fuel, respectively. The increase in the formeris due to small increases in expenditure on conventional and nuclear capacity as a result ofa retiming of contract payments. In addition, the industry&apos;s latest plans, at present underconsideration by the Minister, indicate that, in order to keep pace with the faster growth ofelectricity demand now being experienced, it may be necessary to spend a further  6-2 million in 1961-62 on reinforcing the distribution system. The present figures for 1961-62 take no account of this further expenditure. The fall in expenditure on nuclear fuel reflects alterations in the commissioning dates of the earlier nuclear power stations.J Less debt redemption payments in respect of certain vested assets.g This is mainly bank borrowing. The minus sign reflects the fact that repaymentsexceeded borrowing in the year concerned.

This is partly because the present figures are on a financial year basis, whereas those in Cmnd. 1203 were on a calendar year basis, and partly because the present figures include interest during con-struction, which was excluded from the earlier ones. Investment in both 1960-61 and 1961-62is now expected to be at a lower level than previously estimated due to final settlements onold contracts and work on new projects proceeding more slowly than was anticipated.TABLE VIISouth of Scotland Electricity Board: Financing of Capital Requirements  million	1958-59	1959-60	1960-61 (estimate)	1961-62 (forecast)Fixed investment   ...      ......

Investment in the first quarter of 1962 and the borrowing from the Exchequer inthe financial year 1961-62 will be affected by the programme agreed for the whole of 1962.t Interest payable on capital moneys borrowed for the purposes of British Railways andchargeable to the Special Account established under Section 3 of the Transport (RailwayFinances) Act, 1957.J As explained in paragraph 21, the Commission^ revenue deficits for 1958 and 1959have been financed by borrowings from the Exchequer under the Transport (Railway Finances)Act, 1957, and deficits for 1960 and 1961 are being financed above the line. Practically allthe &quot; Internal Resources &quot; included in the table represent provisions, principally for depreci-ation, charged to revenue and are therefore reflected in the revenue deficit financed by theExchequer.
LOANS TO OTHER PUBLIC BODIESLoans to Local Authorities23. There are long-standing arrangements whereby local authorities canseek access to Exchequer funds through the Public Works Loan Board. Theconditions governing lending by the Board (which is an independent body consisting of twelve unpaid Commissioners with experience of local authorityfinance and general financial experience) vary from time to time.24. Since October 1955 Government policy has been that local authoritiesshould, as far as possible, raise the capital they need on the market in order toreduce the calls on the Exchequer, and the Public Works Loan Board has beenasked to consider local authorities&apos; ability to raise capital on reasonable termsfrom other sources when dealing with applications for loans. Interest is charged at the rates paid on the market by local authorities of good standingfor loans of comparable periods. As a result of this policy, Public WorksLoan Board lending has fallen from a post-war peak of  436 million in 1952-53to  40 million in 1960-61. There has been a corresponding reduction inExchequer issues to the Local Loans Fund (repayable to the Exchequer byannuities) for the Board&apos;s lending requirements. No Exchequer issues havebeen needed since 1957-58, apart from temporary advances which have beenrepaid before the end of the year concerned.Summary Capital Transactions of the Local Loans Fund  million	1958-59	1959-60	1960-61	1961-62Drawings from the Exchequer   ...

Under the Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Acts 1950 and 1955,the Treasury may lend up to  30 million to the Northern Ireland exchequer to enable the Government of Northern Ireland to make loans to local authoritiesand other specified bodies and persons from the Northern Ireland government loans Fund. This fund provides facilities in Northern Ireland similar to those provided in Great Britain by the Local Loans Fund. In 1961-62 provision isbeing made for a loan of  1 million to the Northern Ireland Exchequer. Out-standing loans from earlier periods amount to  20 million and are being repaidon an annuity basis over sixty years.   Figures are given in the Appendix.Loans to the New Towns Acts Corporations26. The Act setting up the new towns provided (in Sections 12 and 25) thatthe Minister of Housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State forScotland could make advances to the Development Corporations for the new
towns to meet their capital expenditure, including working capital. 80 percent, of the expenditure is on housing. The New Towns Act, 1959, providesthat the total advances to the corporations shall not exceed  400 million. Upto 31st March, 1961, the total issues from the Consolidated Fund were 277 million;  243 million to the Minister of Housing and Local Government,and  34 million to the Secretary of State for Scotland. These advances arerepayable over 60 years on an annuity basis.27. The New Towns Act, 1959, authorised the setting up of the commission for the New Towns to take over and manage the assets and liabilities of theDevelopment Corporations on their demise when the building of the towns is substantially complete, and authorise advances to it from the consolidate fund to meet capital expenditure or to finance revenue deficits. The advancesoutstanding at any one time may not exceed  5 million and  1 million respec-tively. The Commission has not yet been appointed and the only issue likelybefore the end of 1961-62 is a small amount for working capital. these provisions of the Act do not apply to Scotland.Loans for New Towns Development  million	1958-59	1959-60	1960-61	1961-62Issues for Capital Purposes	27-9	23-9	25-1	28-1Receipts     ............	0-8	0-9	10	1-net Issues     .........	27-1	23-0	24-1	27-0Loans to the Scottish Special Housing Association28. Under the Housing (Scotland) Acts, 1950 to 1957, advances of up to 100 million may be made by the Secretary of State for Scotland to the scottish special Housing Association for the purpose of providing houses in Scotland.By the end of March, 1961, it is expected that a total of  80-7 million will havebeen advanced. The loans made to the Association are repayable by annuitiesover 60 years. In addition to these loans, any deficiency which may arise on theAssociation^ operations is met by a payment from the Scottish Health Depart-ment Vote (Class V. 11, Sub-head A.7.).Loans to the Scottish Special Housing Association  million	1958-59	1959-60	1960-61	1961-62Issues        ...      .........	5-6	4-1	3-4	3-7Receipts     ...      ......	0-4	0-4	0-4	0-4Net Issues      .........	5-2	3-7	30	3-3The Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency29. The Iron and Steel Holding and Realisation Agency was set up underthe Iron and Steel Act, 1953, and, on the dissolution of the Iron and steel corporation, took over from that body those iron and steel companies which became publicly-owned under the powers of the Iron and Steel Act, 1949.
The duty of the Agency as laid down in the 1953 Act was to secure the returnto private ownership of its subsidiary companies for a financially adequateconsideration and in the meantime to exercise its powers as a holding company to ensure the efficient direction of its subsidiaries.30. During the years 1958-59 to 1960-61 the sums received by the Agencyfrom the disposal of assets have been mainly used to finance the further develop-ment of its subsidiary companies, notably Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd.In 1961-62 the sales of securities held by the Agency are expected to provide anet surplus of  20 million after providing for the various calls the Agencyexpects to be made upon it, and this sum will be paid into the Exchequer.This amount is accordingly shown as a receipt in the Appendix.Loans to Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd.31. Section 5 of the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, authorises the Minister of power to make payments out of monies voted by Parliament, for the provisionof additional facilities for the production of iron and steel in Great Britain.The Iron and Steel (Financial Provisions) Act, 1960, authorises issues out of the consolidated Fund, up to a limit of  120 million, before 31st March, 1965, asloans for capital purposes in connection with the iron and steel industry, andthis enables payments for these purposes by the Minister of Power to be madebelow the line.32. In accordance with the 1953 Act, the Minister of Power has enteredinto an agreement with Messrs. Richard Thomas and Baldwins Ltd. to assist in the financing of the fixed installations at the new steel strip mill to be erectedat Newport, Monmouthshire. The heads of the agreement with RichardThomas and Baldwins were announced in the House of Commons on 13thMarch, 1959 (House of Commons Official Report, Col. 143), and an extensionof it was similarly announced on 16th December, 1959 (House of CommonsOfficial Report, Col. 199). Briefly, the agreement provides for a loan of up to 70 million to be made in the period up to 30th September, 1964, and to be repaid in full by 1st October, 1971. The agreement provides for the paymentof interest on each tranche of the loans at rates to be determined by the Treasuryhaving regard to the cost of borrowing by Her Majesty&apos;s Government at thedate of drawing each tranche.33. During 1960-61 the Company drew  12-1 million under the agreement and expects to draw  57-9 million in 1961-62. In addition, the Iron and SteelHolding and Realisation Agency is lending  31 million to Richard Thomas and baldwins in 1960-61 and will lend a further  58 million in 1961-62 to helpmeet the Company&apos;s needs for working capital and short-term finance at New-port and to finance investment elsewhere. This will be provided from the proceeds of the sale of securities held by the Agency.Loans to the Covent Garden Market Authority34. Under the Covent Garden Market Bill, at present before Parliament,a statutory market authority called the Covent Garden Market Authority is tobe established to provide a wholesale horticultural market in the Covent Gardenarea and to secure the better planning and utilisation of the area as a whole.In its early days tne Authority may not be able to meet all its commitmentsout of revenue, and consequently it may not be able to raise the capital which
it needs on the market. The Bill therefore provides that the Authority may bor-row up to  8 million from the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodduring the period ending ten years from the date on which the new Authoritytakes over the market. Subject to the approval of the necessary legislation byParliament, issues to the Authority may start in 1961-62.Loans to the Sugar Board35. The Sugar Board was established under the Sugar Act, 1956. It is charged with the duty of purchasing Commonwealth sugar either in fulfilment of Her Majesty&apos;s Government^ contractual obligation under the Common-wealth Sugar Agreement or as may be specially directed by the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Minister is authorised to advancesuch sums as may be necessary to enable the Board to discharge this duty, the advances outstanding at any one time not to exceed  25 million.36. The Sugar Board is also empowered to advance money to the british sugar Corporation to fulfil its duties under the Act regarding the purchase ofhome-grown beet. The Minister in turn may advance to the Board such sumsas are needed for this purpose within an outstanding limit at any one time of 30 million. Issues to the Sugar Board and repayments by it are made on aday to day basis throughout the year and the gross figures of issues and receiptsduring any one year, as in the case of the National Coal Board, are many times the net figure of issues or repayments for the year as a whole, as the table below shows.  million	1958-59	1959-60	1960-61	1961-62Issues to the Sugar Board......	72-1	59-0	61 0	60-0Repayments by the Sugar Board ...	72-2	60-9	61 0	61-0Net Repayments      ......	0-1	1-9	-	-1-0Loans to the Potato Marketing Board37. From 1955 to 1959 the Potato Marketing Board were enabled to guaran-tee the prices received by potato producers by means of advances made to the potato Marketing Board by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodunder Section 2 of the Miscellaneous Financial Provisions Act, 1955. Thisempowered the Minister to advance up to  30 million to the Potato MarketingBoard. These arrangements were ended in July 1959 and the price support arrangements for potatoes are now being met entirely by payments from theAgricultural and Food Grants and Subsidies Vote (Class VIII 2). The total amount of advances, together with the accrued interest on them, were repaidby the Potato Marketing Board prior to 31 st March, 1960. Figures of advancesand repayments are given in the Appendix.Loans to the National Research Development Corporation38. This Corporation was set up under the Development of InventionsAct, 1948, to secure the development and exploitation of inventions resultingfrom public or other research and to hold the patent rights in them, when thisis in the public interest. The Board of Trade has power to advance up to 10 million to the Corporation for capital expenditure for this purpose, in the
period up to 1969. By the end of March, 1961,  3-5 million will have been advanced. Issues since 1958-59 have been running at the rate of about 500,000 a year.   Figures are given in the Appendix.Loans to the Independent Television Authority39. When the Independent Television Authority was set up in 1955 thePostmaster-General was given power under the Television Act, 1954, to lend upto  2 million to the Authority for the purpose of meeting initial investment and working capital. The Authority borrowed  0-6 million under the Act, all ofwhich has now been repaid. The final instalment was received in 1959-60.Figures of repayments are given in the Appendix.The National Film Finance Corporation40. The Coporation is a statutory body established under the cinema to-graph Film Production (Special Loans) Act, 1949. Its function is to makeloans to be employed in financing the production and distribution of cine-matograph films. The Corporation has power under the 1949 and subsequentActs to borrow up to  6 million from the Board of Trade and  2 million fromother sources. The Corporation^ power to borrow from the Board of Tradewas fully exercised by 31st March, 1957.LOANS TO PRIVATE INDUSTRYTotal Government Assistance to Private Industry41. Most Government assistance to private industry is borne on Depart-mental Votes and details of this expenditure will be published in the FinancialSecretary&apos;s Memorandum on the 1961-62 Estimates for the Civil and RevenueDepartments to be published on Budget Day. The Government is at presentlending money below the line only to the steel company of Colvilles Ltd. andto building societies. (Richard Thomas and Baldwins, the other steel company with which the Government has a loan agreement, is still publicly owned.)42. The Government also propose to make loans below the line to the cunard Steamship Co. Ltd. and to Housing Associations in England and Wales.The following paragraphs explain both the existing and the proposed loansin more detail. Total Government assistance to private industry includinggrants, loans and other forms of assistance, both above and below the line, is summarised in the following table:   million	1958-59	1959-60	1960-61	1961-62Above the Line  (Details to be given in the Finan-cial Secretary&apos;s Memorandum.)	315-0	285-0	325-0	330-0Below the Line  Loan to Colvilles Ltd.......

Loan to Colvilles Ltd.43. In accordance with the Iron and Steel Act, 1953, the Minister of power has entered into an agreement with Colvilles Ltd. for the construction of asteel mill at Ravenscraig. The heads of agreement with Colvilles were announced to the House on 21st January, 1959 (House of Commons official report, Col. 38). In brief, the agreement provides for a loan not exceeding 50 million to be made during the period to 30th September, 1963, and to be repaid by 1st October, 1978. The agreement, as in the case of Richard thomas and Baldwins, provides for the payment of interest on each tranche of the loanat rates to be determined by the Treasury having regard to the cost of borrowingby Her Majesty&apos;s Government at the time each tranche is drawn. During1960-61 Colvilles Ltd. drew  15 million at a rate covering the cost of borrowing.In 1961-62 they are expected to draw  30 million.Loans to Building Societies44. In a White Paper published in November 1958 (Cmnd. 571) the Govern-ment announced its proposals for enabling more people to buy their own houses,by increasing the amount of money available for lending on mortgages. This wasto be done by advancing Exchequer money to building societies for re-lendingto would-be purchasers of pre-1919 houses. Statutory provision for thispurpose is now contained in Part I of the House Purchase and Housing Act,1959. This authorises the Minister of Housing and Local Government, orthe Secretary of State for Scotland, to make advances of up to  100 million to building societies designated under Section 1 of the Act, to the extent that thosesocieties have themselves made advances for the purchase or improvement ofhouses completed before 1919 with an estimated value of not more than  2,500(or  3,000 in the Metropolitan Police District or the City of London). TheExchequer loans are for a period of 20 years repayable half-yearly on anannuity basis The rate of interest charged is not fixed at the outset of theloan but varies from time to time with the minimum rate recommended by theBuilding Societies Association for mortgages for private occupation, beingone-half of one per cent, below that rate.Loans to Building Societies for House Purchase  million	1959-60	1960-61	1961-62Issues..................	13-1	36-0	400Receipts     ...............	0-1	0-4	1-4Net issues      ............	13-0	35-6	38-6Loans to Housing Associations45. In order to encourage the provision of unsubsidised housing for letting,statutory authority is being sought in Clause 7 of the Housing Bill now beforeParliament to enable the Minister of Housing and Local Government to make advances up to a total of  25 million to meet the whole or part of the cost ofhouses to be provided by housing associations who have entered into anagreement with him for this purpose. No subsidy will be paid on any of thesehouses, except in the case of purpose-built accommodation for old people,which will rank for the  24 subsidy.   It is proposed that these advances should
be repayable over a maximum period of 60 years, and should bear interest atthe rate being charged to local authorities by the Public Works Loan Board atthe time of drawing for loans repayable over the period concerned. Subject tothe necessary legislation being passed by Parliament, it is proposed that theMinisters power to make advances should take effect when the Bill comes intooperation.Loan to the Cunard Steamship Co. Ltd.46. The Government also propose to make a contribution to the CunardSteamship Co. Ltd., to help towards the cost of replacing the &quot; Queen Mary.&quot;As the Minister of Transport announced to Parliament on 3rd November, 1960(House of Commons Official Report, Col. 361), the Government propose, subjectto the necessary legislation, to make available to the Company 60 per cent, ofthe total cost of the ship, subject to a maximum contribution of  18 million.The contribution will be partly by way of loan, bearing interest at the rate being charged by the Public Works Loan Board for loans of 25 years at the date whenthe agreement with Cunard is signed, and partly by way of grant, carried onMinistry of Transport Votes. It is not expected that any advances will bemade to Cunard before 1st April, 1962.
LOANS FOR OVERSEAS ASSISTANCEPolicy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government47. The White Paper on Assistance for Overseas Development (Cmnd. 974)published in March, 1960, described the assistance given from United KingdomGovernment funds to overseas countries. Some of this assistance is provided on Votes and some by way of loans below the line. The loans below the linefall into three classes, described below.Loans to Colonial Governments48. Section 2 (1) of the Colonial Development and Welfare Act, 1959,authorised the Secretary of State for the Colonies, with Treasury approval, tomake loans tc colonial governments to provide finance for any of the purposesof approved development programmes. Approvals of such loans must notexceed  25 million in any one year, nor  100 million in total in the five years tothe 31st March, 1964.   Issues may continue, however, up to 31st March, 1967.49. Up to 31st March, 1961, loans amounting to  42 million have beenapproved (excluding one approval for  1 million in 1959-60 which was sub-sequently cancelled) and the following issues made: TABLE XIILoans to Colonial Governments  million	1959-60	1960-61Aden        ...............	0-7	_British Guiana     ............	0-3	1-8Cyprus (before independence)   ......	11	 East Africa High Commission  ......	 	3-75Kenya      ...............	1-5	6-5Nigeria (before independence)   ......	 	3-0Sierra Leone	1-5	1-5Southern Cameroons     .........	 	0-35Tanganyika...............	 	1-5Uganda     ...............	3 0	3-6Basutoland...............	 	0 05Bechuanaland      ............	 	0-3Swaziland...............	0-2	1-12Total        ............	8-3	23-57During 1961-62 it is estimated that approvals will amount to  20 millionwith issues of  30 million.Loans to the Colonial Development Corporation50. The Colonial Development Corporation was set up in 1948 to assistColonial Territories in the development of their economies. Under the pro-visions of the Overseas Development Act, 1959, (which consolidated earlierlegislation) the Corporation is allowed to borrow up to given limits to carry out its functions. Its outstanding temporary borrowing may not exceed  10million and its other borrowing  150 million. Under Section 13 of the 1959Act, the Secretary of State may make advances to the Corporation up to an outstanding limit of  130 million. At the 31st March, 1961, outstandingadvances from the Secretary of State amounted to  68-8 million. Most ofthese advances have been made on a long-term basis repayable over forty years.So far the C.D.C. has not raised money from private sources.

Loans can be made to countries overseas under Section 3 of the export guarantees Acts, 1949-59. Promissory notes signed by the borrowers arepurchased from moneys advanced for this purpose from the consolidate fund to an &quot; Acquisition of Guaranteed Securities Fund&quot;. repayments of principal and interest by the borrowing Governments are credited to theAcquisition of Guaranteed Securities Fund. These loans may be drawn upon only to finance payments to or for the benefit of United Kingdom firms.The loans are negotiated and recorded in the form of intergovernmental agree-ments which provide for the periods of drawing and repayment. So far,twenty loan agreements have been made under the Act to eight countries asfollows: TABLE XIIILoans Under The Export Guarantees Acts  millionCountry	Number of	Amount	Loans	Iraq        ...............	1	3-0Yugoslavia       ............	5	20-0Iran       ...............	2	101Pakistan...............	3	25-0India      ...............	6	80-5Sudan     ...............	1	5-0Malaya   ...............	1	2-3		Nigeria    ...      ............	1	12-0Total      ............	20	157-9Some of these loans have not yet been fully spent.

Repayments Under the Anglo-Turkish (Armaments Credit) Agreement Act, 193852. The advances under the 1938 Act have been completely repaid, but the later repayments were made in blocked Turkish currency. Sterling receiptsaccrue as arrangements are made for the currency to be released. The finalrepayment by Turkey was made in 1959-60.PAYMENTS ARISING FROM WAR-TIME LIABILITIESComposition of Payments53. This heading covers three types of payment Repayments of Post-WarCredits, Post-War Refunds of Excess Profits Tax and War Damage Payments.Subsequent paragraphs explain these payments in more detail and figures ofthe issues made from the Consolidated Fund in the years 1958-59 to 1960-61and expected issues in 1961-62 are given in the Appendix.Post-War Credits54. Under war-time financial legislation certain Income Tax payments were regarded as repayable Post-War Credits. The Income Tax (Repayment of post-War Credits) Act, 1959, and Regulations made thereunder (S.I. 1959No. 876, and S.I. 1960, No. 769) extended the categories of persons entitled to claim repayment of these credits. The Act provides that the qualifications for repayment of Post-War Credits shall be prescribed by the Treasury by regulations subject to approval by the House of Commons and that sumsrequired by the Commissioners of Inland Revenue for making repayments,for which the Treasury is given power to borrow, shall be charged on the Con-solidated Fund. The 1959 Act also provides that interest at the rate of 2\ percent, per annum shall accrue from the beginning of October, 1959, on all creditsnot repaid by the end of that month. Interest is paid when the credit is itselfrepaid and is charged on the Consolidated Fund above the line.Post-War Refunds of Excess Profits Tax55. Part of the war-time Excess Profits Tax was repayable after the war(Part IV of the Finance No. 2 Act, 1945, and Section 32, Finance Act, 1953).The repayments are now running at a very low level.War Damage Payments56. Two items appear under the heading of War Damage payments. TheWar Damage Commission are responsible for payment of compensation for damage to land and buildings and the Board of Trade for the loss of goods and chattels. Payments under both heads have been at much lower levels in recent years than in the early post-war period, and they continue to fall asthe amount of unrepaired war damage diminishes and claims are settled.OTHER ADVANCES AND REPAYMENTSLoans for Post-War Temporary Houses57. Under the Housing (Temporary Accommodation) Act, 1944, advancestotalling  207 million were issued to enable the Ministry of Works to providetemporary houses for Local Authorities at the end of the war.   These advances
are now being repaid to the Consolidated Fund under the provisions of theRequisitioned Houses and Housing (Amendment) Act, 1955 by annuitiesborne on the Votes for Housing, England and Wales and Housing, Scotland(Votes Class V, 2 and Class V, 11). The final annuity is due to be repaid in1961-62.   Figures of repayments in recent years are given in the Appendix.Loans for Married Quarters for the Armed Forces58. Funds for the provision of Service married quarters come from twosources, from the Votes of the Service Departments and from issues under the armed Forces (Housing Loans) Acts, 1949 and 1958. These Acts provide that up to  95 million may be advanced to the Service Departments up to 1965for the construction of married quarters, to supplement the sums made available from Service Votes. Advances under the Armed Forces (Housing Loans)Acts are applied as appropriations-in-aid of the Defence Votes. The advancesthemselves can be repaid in two ways by means of 60-year annuities borne onthe Defence Votes and by means of premature repayments from the sales ofhouses no longer needed by the Services. Issues from and receipts into the consolidated Fund under these Acts are shown below.  million	1958-59	1959-60	1960-61	1961-62Issues from the Consolidated Fund	2 1	0-7		60Receipts     ............	0-2	0-3		0- net issues      .........	1-9	0-4		5-8Town and Country Planning Compensation59. Under legislation passed in 1954, the only issues that may be made underthese Acts are in respect of claims for losses of development value arising out ofhappenings prior to 1st January, 1955. These claims were met out of advancesfrom the Consolidated Fund to the Central Land Board (before it was dissolvedon 1st April, 1959), the Minister of Housing and Local Government and theSecretary of State for Scotland under Section 64 (1) of the Town and country planning Act, 1954 and Section 64 (1) of the Town and Country Planning(Scotland) Act, 1954. Repayment of these advances is made by twenty-year annuities on the Votes of the Ministry of Housing and Local Governmentand the Department for Health for Scotland (Class V 1 and V 9). All but afew claims have been settled and henceforth the Consolidated Fund will be anet receiver until the issues have been repaid. Payments in respect of currentplanning decisions, i.e. those given on or after 1st January, 1955, are bornedirect on the Votes of the two departments.   Figures are given in the Appendix.Tithe Redemption60. The Tithe Act, 1936, extinguished tithe rent charges and made provisionfor stock to be issued to tithe owners as compensation. The compensationstock is serviced primarily by tithe redemption annuities paid into a RedemptionAnnuities Account by the persons formerly liable to tithe rent charge. UnderSection 26 of the Act the Treasury is authorised to issue out of the consolidate fund such sums as may be necessary to enable the Redemption AnnuitiesAccount to meet its commitments.   These advances are usually of a temporary-
nature and carry interest accordingly which, exceptionally, is applied to theredemption of debt.   Figures are given in the Appendix.Repayment of Loans for Land Settlement61. Under the Land Settlement Facilities Acts, 1919 and 1921, the PublicWorks Loan Board made loans to Local Authorities in connection with landsettlement schemes. The loans, which ceased in 1926, are being repaid byannuities over periods of up to 80 years.   Figures are given in the Appendix.
