secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT&apos;Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1959C. (59) 180 Copy No.     6 27th December, 1959CABINETPOLICY FOR FUELMemorandum by the Minister of power the Economic Policy Committee invited me to submit for consideration bythe Cabinet the attached paper in which I review our fuel policy and certainproblems arising out of it.2.   The main points made in the paper are:  (a) Our policy for fuel and power should continue to be based on competition and on consumers freedom of choice. This stimulates efficiency in the fuel and power industries and helps to cheapen their products.(b) In applying this policy we are faced with certain wider social, strategic and economic considerations and we should be prepared to modify our policy to have proper regard for them.(c) The coal industry has experienced a sharp contraction in demand duringthe past three years requiring a substantial reduction in the manpowerof the industry and the closure of many pits. The social problems thusraised have been made tolerable only by the policy- of stockpiling coalon a massive scale. But this in turn poses serious economic problems and all possible steps must clearly be taken to halt and reverse it.Present plans offer a reasonable, but not a certain prospect that thispoint has now been reached.(d) Oil is essential to our economy; transport and agriculture depend upon it.We have a great international trade in oil, most valuable to our balanceof payments. But the main sources of our oil supplies are not under our direct control and inevitably present some strategic danger, thoughsources of supply are gradually becoming more diversified and we havea good reserve stockpile against emergency. Moreover, fuel oilsproduced by our home refineries as a joint product of the transport oils,which we must have, are a serious rival to coal. These considerationshave led to demands in some quarters that oil should be taxed orrestricted in some way. There are no sound arguments for such restrictions, which could seriously weaken our overseas trade and increase our fuel costs at home.(e) Successful exploitation of nuclear power requires a full-scale commercial development programme such as that on which we are now engaged.In the short term this has little effect on coal.(/) The electricity industry is prosperous; in the longer term its main problem will be the part to be played by nuclear power. Gas, on the other hand,is fighting for survival. To do so, it is trying to reduce its costs by new production processes and by a greater use of oil as a raw material. the move towards oil sets serious problems for the coal industry, which arebeing closely watched.
(g) Under a competitive fuel policy the parts to be played by the several fuelsmust be mainly determined by market forces, and the fuel industriesmust be permitted a reasonable degree of commercial freedom and initiative. But. national considerations in the social, strategic andeconomic fields demand a certain measure of Government guidance andco-ordination. The present methods chiefly informal-of securing thisseem adequate and preferable to more formal machinery.3. The Economic Policy Committee agreed that it would be undesirable toincrease coal stocks above their present level, and they invited me to report to theCommittee if and when the demand for coal in 1960 seemed likely to be lower thanthe output of coal. They also invited me to consider the possibility of increasingthe demand for coal by relating coal prices more closely to the costs of productionin different areas, and to consider the possibility of increasing coal exports by afurther reduction in export prices.4. The Committee agreed that there was no good argument for restricting the growth of oil usage in the United Kingdom.5. They agreed that the programme for building nuclear power stationsshould continue, but they invited me to consider the possibility of spreading theprogramme over a longer period.6. Subject to the above-mentioned suggestions, which I shall carefullyconsider, the Committee accepted the general lines of policy outlined in my paper,and I hope that the Cabinet will feel able to endorse their approval of this policy.::\ .  4    &apos; - R; F.

ANNEXPOLICY FOR FUELI am convinced that our policy must be based on competition and onconsumers&apos; freedom of choice. We hold that competition will stimulate efficiency in the industries and help to cheapen our power. The Ridley Committee on national Policy for the Use of Fuel and Power Resources (Cmd. 8647) reported in1952:-&quot; the right policy, and indeed the only practicable one, is to leave the pattern of fuel use to be determined by the consumers&apos; own choice between competing services.&quot;But I do not believe that the search for the cheapest and most efficient sources of power can ignore wider considerations, such as the need to conserve the assets Wehave, the balance of payments position, strategic.arguments and various social problems.2. The recent difficulties through which the&apos;-coal industry is passing bringsour policy of reliance on consumers&apos; choice under sharp challenge. This paperreviews the policy in the light of present circumstances.Coal - ^.3: Our indigenous coal industry represents an asset of special, value.Excluding agriculture, it represents 90 per cent, of bur raw materials, production.During, years of coal shortage the Coal Board&apos;s efforts, to increase efficiency andcheck the upsurge in.costs were largely frustrated,by the need to obtain maximumoutput at all costs. Since 1956 the situation has been dramatically reversed. Thedecline in demand is largely due to the continued growth of oil usage in industry generally, combined with a significant improvement in fuel efficiency, which, havenot been, off set by any increase in the total demand for energy. In an industry sohighly dependent on human labour, this adjustment presents a special socialproblem.4. Gloomy views are expressed about bpal&apos;s,future, but it still supplies the major proportion (80 per cent.) of our primary fuel heeds. The long-terminvestment plan, drawn up by the Board and.recently approved.by.the Government,estimates coal&apos;s share of the primary fuel:market,at about 70 per cent, in 1965,industry&apos;s total energy requirements are likely to have increased considerably by then and the-demand for coal may be fractionally higher, than, it is to-day. The pitclosures between now and 1965, announced by the Coal Board and made necessary by competition, should be beneficial,to coal in the,long run,.. The. intention is that by 1965 80 per cent, of the output will come from new or reconstructed collieries.5. The closures planned for the next few years should not present a generalsocial problem although there will almost certainly be small local pockets Ofconsiderable difficulty in areas unattractive to new industry, which will need veryserious consideration:6: The policy of stocking surplus coal during this difficult trahsitibrial period;although much criticised, has made possible a gradual, rather than a quick and verypainful [ contraction of the industry. The stockbuild during this year, alonerepresents the output Of 50,0.00 men: But there friiist clearly be a limit to this process of stock accumulatidn arid proper steps taken to reverse it. certain suggestions are examined in the Appendix, but I aril convinced.that .the; soundestCourse is to rely on the reduced level of coal production. The Coal Board plan to achieve the bulk of their fhanpdwer reduction by the end of next year and hope by then to have achieved sufficient reduction in output to be able to make a&apos; start in&apos;lifting their undistributed stocks., .-7, Besides, providing the finance to cover stocking, the wind has been temperedin other ways. Thus: &apos;   (i) There is a bah on imports of foreign coal, including American aria1 Polishcoal.
(ii) The major oil companies have increased the price of fuel oil by 10s. a tonand additional imports of Russian fuel oil which could easily undermine the fuel oil price structure here have been banned.(iii) There has been a considerable reduction in opencast production-despite the financial loss to the Board.(iv) We have secured a modification of the electricity industry&apos;? programme of oil conversion and we have stimulated discussions between the coal and gas industries which should prove helpful to coal (see paragraph 16i below). &apos; ,.   \ , &apos;8. The&apos; National Union of Mineworkers demands that the Governmentshould in some way underwrite a certain level of coal production. Such a guaranteewould involve the control of consumer choice and the removal of the spur to efficiency; the plight Of the coal industry is in no way so severe as to merit suchprotection. The shading of the policy of competition, described in the preceding paragraphs, seems at present to strike the necessary balance.Oil9. Oil use in the United Kingdom presents a picture of change and rapid growth. Before the war we imported petroleum products, mainly for use astransport fuels, and pil provided 7 per cent, of our total fuel needs. Very little ofthe oil was refined in this country. To-day we have the largest refining industryin the free world outside the United States, and there is a substantial and growingmarket for the black oils used for burning in competition with coal. To-day oil&apos;s share of the United Kingdom fuel market has grown to 20 per cent, and by 1965may have grown to 25 per cent. But this does not tell the whole story. Ourtransport system-by land, by sea, and by air largely moves on oil; lacking anample supply of oil, industry and commerce could scarcely survive in the world markets on which our economy depends. Whatever the strategic disadvantages,therefore, we must ensure that we import the oil which is indispensable as fuel for transport and for a number of other key industries like agriculture. Our largedomestic, refining industry covers these requirements by treating imported crude,and in the process automatically provides large supplies of fuel oils which mustfind a market. We also import fuel oils, but our imports are more than counter-balanced by our exports, including supplies for ships&apos; bunkers. The situation maychange in the future, but broadly it is true to say that, of recent years, home demand for fuel oil has been matched by the output of our own refineries in theprocess of making the other oil products which we must have.10. The risk remains that the flow of crude oil from our normal sources ofsupply of which the Middle East is the most important may be interrupted. TheGovernment recently decided to increase the level of our oil stocks in order toguard against this danger. Moreover, for some years to come, this threat is considerably mitigated by the large surplus of tankers and by the existence of very substantial shut-in producing capacity in all the main sources of oil production. Inthese circumstances the precautions we have taken should enable us to get througheven a widespread interruption of oil supplies for a period of about a year without serious harm to the economy.11. Our interest as an oil-using country is overshadowed from the balance ofpayments point of view by our large stake in the international oil trade. TheBritish companies handle about one-third of all the oil that enters into international trade in the free world and sell abroad about five times as much as our total oilconsumption in this country. Their foreign trade in oil brings in gross earnings of  1,500 millions a year which, after deducting outgoings, gives us net invisibleearnings of over  200 millions a year. In the past, these net invisible earnings,added to the proceeds of exports from refineries in the United Kingdom and of our exports of.oil equipment, have sufficed to meet the foreign exchange cost of the,oilwe import into the United Kingdom and of the overseas investment necessary tomaintain and expand the resources of British oil companies as world demand foroil grows. This year, exceptionally, with the recession in the oil trade and thedepressed state of the oil tanker market, there is likely to be an overall deficit in our oil balance of payments of about  100 millions representing about one-quarter ofthe gross value of United Kingdom oil imports as shown in the Trade and navigation Accounts. But,.at the same time, our overseas oil assets will be showingan increase of the same order.  (The overseas assets of British oil companies now
exceed  1,000 millions of which not more than a quarter are situated in the middle east.) - &apos;p:   - - :&apos;^&apos;-Mi12. Viewed against this wider background of our large overseas trade in oil,the case for restricting oil usage in tnis country for balance of payments reasons isweak; and if we, as one of the leading international traders in oil, were to impose restrictions in our home market, bur example could set off repercussions in our overseas oil markets and on the position of British companies in the oil producingareas which feed these markets that would far outweigh any benefit we could hope to gain at home. Moreover, our competitors in world trade, like us, are makingincreasing use of oil to satisfy their energy needs. In the rest of Western Europe,oil plays a larger part than it does here, and though there are some signs ofprotectionism in Western Germany and elsewhere it must, in the long run, be toour advantage if our competitors add to their fuel costs while we maintain our policy of freedom of choice for the consumer.13. For these reasons, there seem to be no good arguments for restricting the growth of oil usage in this country, on grounds either of strategic needs or ofthe position of our balance of payments.Nuclear Power14. Nuclear fission is a third primary source of energy potentially availableto this country, and there is no doubt that sooner or later this source of supply will be needed. It is essential that we should develop its potentialities so that it is ready to play its part when the time comes. The only way to acquire the necessarypractical experience is to go into production on a full commercial scale. the nuclear programme will, of course, be kept under review as our technical knowledgeadvances, but there are strong arguments against cutting back the present programme for building nuclear power stations. Contractors must have a firmbasis on which to plan. A steady flow of orders at this stage is essential to thecontinued existence of the nuclear plant industry which is vital to the maintenanceof Britain&apos;s lead in this field and to the realisation of the export potential which our lead has opened up. In any case, these new nuclear stations will have little effect on the coal position for the next two years.Secondary Fuels15. The electricity industry presents a picture of steady increase in efficiency and expansion at a rate (at present about 7 per cent, per annum) largely unafftcted by short-term changes in the economy. At present, it is almost entirely based on coal and its consumption of coal will continue to increase at least until the middle1960&apos;s. Its present use of oil is marginal and will decline as present contracts runout. In the longer term the choices it will have to make between coal and nuclear energy will grow in importance.16. By contrast the gas industry is struggling for its life, but I am sure thata fuel of great flexibility and convenience, which can be easily stored, still has animportant part to play here, as in the United States and elsewhere. Moreover, theBritish gas industry is likely to remain one of the Coal Board&apos;s largest customersso long as it can retain its market; and if it lost that market, coal would sufferseverely because a great share of it would be won by oil. But to survive, the gas industry must reduce the cost of its product by obtaining cheap raw materials. . Itis faced by the difficulty of disposing of the coke produced as a result of conventionalmethods of carbonising coal; and it is meeting fierce competition on many fronts,not least from oil. It is introducing processes for the complete gasification of coal and it is turning more and more to petroleum products, including refinery gases, asa cheap source of raw material with which to fight off competition. There aredangers here, both from the point of view of coal and from the point of view ofmaking a basic service like gas unduly dependent on imported materials. On theother hand, it would be wrong to deny the gas industry the benefits of technicalprogress which would allow it to compete. The prospective reduction in the takeof coal by the gas industry is likely to have serious local effects on the Durharncoalfield but discussions have been taking place between the Coal Board and the gas industry and I am hopeful that an agreed solution may be reached. Thequestion of the importation of liquid methane will certainly, raise considerationsimportant enough for me to consult my colleagues again when I receive&apos;proposals from the Gas Council.  fyx$$B *s izszwo oAi.)   unpxQ -ttui&amp;z sal K vutovxaSEcSMJsa
Co-ordination17. The demand for a co-ordinated fuel policy means that the pattern of fuelvise should in some way be fixed by authority. Under bur competitive fuel policy the pattern of use is mainly determined by the forces of the market, and theexecution of policy is largely left to the industries themselves. In tlie.nationalisedsector the relationships between the. Government and the industries are beingseparately considered by the Committee under the Home Secretary. But unlessthe Boards of the: fuel industries have a large degree of commercial freedom aridinitiative; rib competitive fuel and power policy can work.18. This freedorii needs to.be reconciled with some provision for governmentalsupervision arid,co-ordination in the national interest. We must ensure that the varying balance of advantage,between the fuels which competition may producedoes not entail serious social and economic disorganisation, and we must besatisfied that the international commitments of our fuel industries do not endangerbur riatibnal security and well beirig. It is for thi$ - purpose&apos; primarily ttiat myDepartriient exists. The riecessary guidance seems most easily given throughinformal, rather than formal channels. Personal arid frequent contacts With theleaders of the industries offer obvious opportunities, but there are other means. Inthe nationalised industries, the need to obtain statutory approval for investment programmes gives me an invaluable opportunity to co-ordinate them. And thereare less, direct means, such as the setting, up by my predecessor of a Corhmitteeto consider the possible production of oil, gas and chemicals from coal.Conclusion19.

APPENDIXCOAL STOCKS1. There are now 36 million tons of coal in stock at collieries and opencastsites, of which 23 million tons consist of small coal mainly suitable for use in power stations and other large steam-raising plant. The stocks cost about 20s. per tonto put down for a year and a further 4s. per ton in interest and maintenance costs for eaoh subsequent year they remain unused. Their total written-down value(including the National Coal Board&apos;s stocks of coke) is about  140 millions andthe cost of stocking largely explains the current scale of the Board&apos;s losses on revenue account.2. These stocks have played a valuable role in cushioning the coal industry from the worst effects of the fall in demand and in giving time to reduce production to the level of demand. They are still equivalent to only about 2\ months&apos;production. In contrast to conditions during, and for some time after, the war;they provide a useful insurance against possible interruptions in supply.3. The Board rightly consider, however, that further growth in these stocksmust now be halted and as soon as possible reversed. The main measure whichthey are taking to achieve this is to reduce total production next year to 195 million tons, which they hope will be slightly less than the level of demand.4. It has been suggested that coal stocks should be sold at special bargainprices. But the difficulties here are that the demand for coal is not very responsive to a change in price and that consumers can meet their needs by using coal from either stock or current production. If the price of stocks were cut, as much aspossible would be bought from this source and a nearly equivalent - tonnage from current production would pass into stock. Again, because the cut .i price thatwould be justified to avoid the cost of putting coal into stock wouiu have to bespread over all coals of equivalent grades, it would make only a small difference to present prices and would have a negligible effect on demand.5. At the meeting of the Economic Policy Committee on 4th November, itwas suggested that the price of coal to the electricity industry should be reduced and charges for connecting electricity consumers waived in order to connect moreconsumers and so use more coal. Unfortunately, the only substantial fields for increasing the number of electricity consumers is in rural areas. Here most newconsumers have to make a contribution towards the cost of connexion and as this does not often deter them, a reduction in installation charges would not significantly increase sales. Other consumers might be persuaded by the offer ofa free connexion to take electricity, but since the average cost of connexion is  150- 200 and an average rural consumer uses the equivalent of only about two tons ofcoal a year, increasing annual coal consumption through free rural installationswould cost  75- 100 per ton.6. It was also suggested that coal stocks might be used as foreign aid,Examination of the possible recipients of such aid shows that most of them importvery little coal. Either their consumption of energy is small or they find it cheaperto buy oil. Others like Kenya and Ghana import their coal from other british territories and we would probably not wish to disrupt this trade. Still others likeHong Kong and Pakistan are so distant that transport of British coal to them wouldbe very costly. There might be possibilities of supplying coal under some form ofGovernment aid to Yugoslavia, Libya and possibly countries like Eire, Portugal,Spain and Greece, but the supplies would be largely at the expense of the UnitedStates. The latter gives aid in the form of surplus agricultural products, but it hasbeen constantly criticised by the Commonwealth and other countries on the grounds that this disrupts markets and is unfair, and we could expect similar criticism. new legislation would be necessary to reimburse the Coal Board to the value of the coalsupplied by them under aid and the Board could expect their normal overseascustomers to press for similar aid.November 1959.
