iBasic duties? 1. [In paragraph 3 of Article 3 and in this Annex, the import dutyapplied to imports of a product on any date means the rate of duty actually in force and levied on imports of that product on that date. Where, how-ever, specific quantities or consignments are allowed to be imported at separately of duty lower than that otherwise levied on imports of that product,that lower rate shall not be considered to be the duty applied to that product.But where a lower rate of duty is applied without quantitative limitation to imports of a product by reason of the purpose for which it is imported, thatrate shall be considered to be the duty applied to that product when importedfor that purpose.]2. Where, in a Member State, the import duty on any product istemporarily suspended or reduced on 1st January, 1960, that Member state may, at any time before 31st December, 1964 restore the import duty onthat product, provided that(a) the industry within its territory has committed itself to substantialexpenditure on the development of manufacture of the product inquestion before the date of signature of this Convention; and(b) the circumstances are such that it is reasonable to assume thatcompetition affecting that product from other Member States was anessential element in the calculation of the industry in making itsinvestment; and(c) either the product is included in a list which has been notified beforethe date of signature of this Convention, to the other States signatory to this Convention, or the Council has authorised such restoration by majority decision.3. A Member State may restore the import duty on a product otherwise than in accordance with paragraph 2 above, provided it has informed allother Member States at least one month before the duty is to be restored.If, however, during that time or later any other Member State has a practicalinterest in the product, i.e., that it produces and exports that product insignificant quantities and so declares to the Member State which is proposing to restore or has restored the duty, that Member State shall not restore or shall remove that duty. The Council may decide, by majority vote, that aMember State does not have a practical interest in the product.4. From the date of restoration of a duty in accordance with paragraph 2 or 3 of this Annex, the duty shall not exceed that permitted under Article 3 on the assumption that the basic duty is the duty whichwould have been applied on 1st January, 1960, if the duty had not been temporarily suspended or reduced on that date.5.   For Denmark, the basic duty for any product shall be that appliedto imports of that product from other Member States on 1st March, 1960.6.   The Council may decide to authorise a Member State to adopt anyrate of duty as the basic duty for any product.7. For Norway the basic duty on each of the following items shall bethe rate of duty specified against that item or such lower rate as may be
specified at the relevant time in Schedule XIV to the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade:	Tariff		Norwegian Kroner per	number	Product	kg. or ad valorem	24.02 B	Cigars   ............	20:-	24.02 C	Cigarettes	20:-ex	32.09 C	Varnishes and polishes	12*%	69.12 Al	Articles of faience, not coloured	22J %, but not less than		or decorated	0.80	69.12 A2	Articles of faience, coloured or	224 %. but not less than		decorated.	1.20ex	70.13 B	Decorated glassware for table	20 %, but not less than		and kitchen purposes	2.40ex	73.17 B	Soil-pipes        ......	15%ex	73.20	Soil-pipes fittings       ......	15%	85.03 A	Galvanic dry cells weighing up	15 %, but not less than		to 180 grams	0.55ex	92.11	Tape-recorders.........	15%8	.   For the United Kingdom the basic duty shall be 33^ per cent		valorem for the following products :  ex 32.05 Synthetic organic dyestuffs (including pigment dyestuffs) otherthan such dyestuffs dispersed or dissolved in cellulose nitrate(plasticised or not); synthetic organic products of a kind used as luminophores, other than such products consisting of synthetic organic dyestuffs (including pigment dyestuffs)dispersed or dissolved in artificial plastic material; and products of the kind known as optical bleaching agents, substantive to thefibre.ex 32.09 Synthetic organic dyestuffs in forms or packings of a kind soldby retail.The provisions of this paragraph will take effect on the understanding thatthe duty of 33-^ per cent will be introduced not later than 1st July, 1960.9. The provisions of this Annex apply only to duties levied on importsof goods eligible for Area tariff treatment.Note to Annex A, paragraph 6It is the intention of the Norwegian Government to administer the quotason the seven products mentioned in this paragraph, which are subject toquantitative import restrictions, when imported from other Member states in such a way that the total effect of obstacles to trade import duties andquotas after the change of the basic duty will not be greater than if noderogation from the base date rules had been invoked.For the remaining three products it is the intention of the norwegian government to give due compensation on other products to Member Statesparticularly affected by rise in import duties.
Rules regarding area origin for tariff purposes for the purpose of determining the origin of goods under Article 4 andfor the application of that Article, the following Rules shall be applied.Rule 1. Interpretative ProvisionsI.   &quot; The Area &quot; means the Area of the Association.2. In determining the place of production of marine products and goodsproduced therefrom, a vessel of a Member State shall be regarded as part ofthe territory of that State. In determining the place from which goods havebeen consigned, marine products taken from the sea or goods producedtherefrom at sea shall be regarded as having been consigned from the territory of a Member State if they were taken by or produced in a vessel of a member state and have been brought direct to the Area.3. A vessel which is registered shall be regarded as a vessel of the state in which it is registered and of which it rlies the flag.4. &quot; Materials&quot; includes products, parts and components used in theproduction of the goods.5. Energy, fuel, plant, machinery and tools used in the production ofgoods within the Area, and materials used in the maintenance of such plant,machinery and tools, shall be regarded as wholly produced within the Areawhen determining the origin of those goods.6. &quot; Produced &quot; in sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 1 of Article 4 and&quot; a process of production&quot; in paragraph 2 of that Article include theapplication of any operation or process, with the exception of any operationor process which consists only of one or more of the following:(a) packing, wherever the packing materials may have been produced;(b) splitting up into lots;(c) sorting and grading;(d) marking;(e) putting up into sets.7.

Application of Percentage CriterionFor the purposes of sub-paragraph (c) of paragraph 1 of Article 4:(a) Any materials which meet the conditions specified in sub-paragraph (a)or (b) of paragraph 1 of that Article shall be regarded as containing noelement imported from outside the Area.(b) The value of any materials which can be identified as having beenimported from outside the Area shall be their c.i.f. value accepted bythe customs authorities on clearance for home use, or on temporaryadmission, at the time of last importation into the territory of the member State where they were used in a process of production, less theamount of any transport costs incurred in transit through the territory of other Member States.(c) If the value of any materials imported from outside the Area cannotbe determined in accordance with sub-paragraph (&amp;), their value shall bethe earliest ascertainable price paid for them in the territory of the member State where they were used in a process of production.(d) If the origin of any materials cannot be determined, such materialsshall be deemed to have been imported from outside the Area and their value shall be the earliest ascertainable price paid for them in theterritory of the Member State where they were used in a process ofproduction.(e) the export price of the goods shall be the price paid or payable for themto the exporter in the territory of the Member State where the goods were produced, that price being adjusted, where necessary, to an f.o.b.or free at frontier basis in that territory.(/) The value under sub-paragraphs (6), (c) or (d) or the export price under sub-paragraph (e) of this Rule may be adjusted to correspond with theamount which would have been obtained on a sale in the open marketbetween buyer and seller independent of each other. This amount shall also be taken to be the export price when the goods are not the subjectof a sale.
Rule 4. Unit of Qualification1.   Each article in a consignment shall be considered separately.2.   For the purposes of paragraph 1 of this Rule :  (a) where the Brussels Nomenclature specifies that a group, set or assemblyof articles is to be classified within a single heading, such a group, setor assembly shall be treated as one article;(b) tools, parts and accessories which are imported with an article, and theprice of which is included in that of the article or for which no separatecharge is made, shall be considered as forming a whole with the article,provided that they constitute the standard equipment customarilyincluded on the sale of articles of that kind;(c) in cases not within sub-paragraphs (a) and (b). goods shall be treatedas a single article if they are so treated for purposes of assessing customsduties by the importing Member State.3. An unassembled or disassembled article which is imported in morethan one consignment because it is not feasible for transport or productionreasons to import it in a single consignment shall, if the importer so requests,be treated as one article.Rule 5. Segregation of materials1. For those products or industries where it would be impracticable forthe producer physically to segregate materials of similar character butdifferent origin used in the production of goods, such segregation may bereplaced by an appropriate accounting system, which ensures that no moregoods receive Area tariff treatment than would have been the case if the producer had been able physically to segregate the materials.2. Any such accounting system shall conform to such conditions asmay be agreed upon by the Member States concerned in order to ensurethat adequate control measures will be applied.Rule 6. Treatment of mixtures1. In the case of mixtures, not being groups, sets or assemblies ofseparable articles dealt with under F.ule 4, a Member State may refuseto accept as being of Area origin any product resulting from the mixingtogether of goods which would qualify as being of Area origin with goods which would not so qualify, if the characteristics of the product as a whole are not essentially different from the characteristics of the goods which havebeen mixed.2. In the case of particular products where it is, however, recognised by Member States concerned to be desirable to permit mixing of the kinddescribed in the foregoing paragraph, such products shall be accepted as of Area origin in respect of such part thereof as may be shown to corresponds to the quantity of goods of Area origin used in the mixing, subject to suchconditions as may be agreed upon.
Rule 7. Treatment of Packing1. Where for purposes of assessing customs duties a Member State treatsgoods separately from their packing, it may also, in respect of its importsfrom the territory of another Member State, determine separately the origin of such packing.2. Where paragraph 1 of this Rule is not applied, packing shall beconsidered as forming a whole with the goods and no part of any packingrequired for their transport or storage shall be considered as having beenimported from outside the Area, when determining the origin of the goods asa whole.3. For the purpose of paragraph 2 of this Rule, packing with whichgoods are ordinarily sold by retail shall not be regarded as packing requiredfor the transport or storage of goods.Rule 8. Documentary Evidence1. A claim that goods shall be accepted as eligible for Area tariff treat-ment shall be supported by appropriate documentary evidence of origin andconsignment.   The evidence of origin shall consist of either (a) a declaration of origin completed by the last producer of the goodswithin the Area, together with a supplementary declaration completed by the exporter in cases where the producer is not himself or by hisagent the exporter of the goods; or(A) a certificate given by a governmental authority or authorised bodynominated by the exporting Member State and notified to the other member States, together with a supplementary declaration completed by the exporter of the goods.These declarations, certificates and supplementary declarations shall be in theform prescribed in Schedule IV to this Annex.2. The exporter may choose either of the forms of evidence referred toill paragraph 1 of this Rule. Nevertheless, the authorities of the country ofexportation may require for certain categories of goods that evidence of originshall be furnished in the form indicated in sub-paragraph (//) of that paragraph.3. In cases where a certificate of origin is to be supplied by agovernmental authority or an authorised body under sub-paragraph (b) ofparagraph 1 of this Rule, that authority or body shall obtain a declarationas to the origin of the goods given by the last producer of the goods withinthe Area. The governmental authority or the authorised body shall satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of the evidence provided; where necessary they shall require the production of additional information, and shall carry out any suitable check, if the authorities of the importing Member State sorequire, a confidential indication of the producer of the goods shall be given.4. Nominations of authorised bodies for the purpose of sub-paragraph (b)of paragraph 1 of this Rule, may be withdrawn by the exporting member state if the need arises. Each Member State shall retain, in regard to itsimports, the right of refusing to accept certificates from any authorised body which is shown to have repeatedly issued certificates in an improper manner,but such action shall not be taken without adequate prior notification to the exporting Member State of the grounds for dissatisfaction.
5. In cases where the Member States concerned recognise that it is impracticable for the producer to make the declaration of origin specified in sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 1 or in paragraph 2 of this Rule, the exportermay make that declaration, in such form as those Member States may forthe purpose specify.Rule 9. Verification of Evidence of Origin1. The importing Member State may as necessary require further evidence to support any declaration or certificate of origin furnished under Rule 8.2. The importing Member State shall not prevent the importer from taking delivery of the goods solely on the grounds that it requires such further evidence, but may require security for any duty or other charge which maybe payable.3. Where, under paragraph 1 of this Rule, a Member State has required further evidence to be furnished, those concerned in the territory of another member State shall be free to produce it to a governmental authority or an authorised body of the latter State, who shall, after thorough verification ofthe evidence, furnish an appropriate report to the importing Member State.4. Where it is necessary to do so by reason of national legislation, aMember State may prescribe that requests by the authorities of importingMember States for further evidence from those concerned in its territory shallbe addressed to a specified governmental authority, who shall after thoroughverification of the evidence furnish an appropriate report to the importingMember State.5. If the importing Member State wishes an investigation to be made intothe accuracy of the evidence which it has received, it may make a request tothat effect to the other Member State or States concerned.6. Information obtained under the provisions of this Rule by the importing Member State shall be treated as confidential.Rule 10. Sanctions1. Member States undertake to introduce legislation, making such provision as may be necessary for penalties against persons who, in their territory, furnish or cause to be furnished a document which is untrue in a material particular in support of a claim in another Member State that goods should be accepted as eligible for Area tariff treatment. The penaltiesapplicable shall be similar to those applicable in cases of untrue declarationsin regard to payment of duty on imports.2. A Member State may deal with the offence out of court if it can bemore appropriately dealt with by a compromise penalty or similaradministrative procedure.3. A Member State shall be under no obligation to institute or continuecourt proceedings, or action under paragraph 2 of this Rule,(a) if it has not been requested to do so by the importing Member state to which the untrue claim was made; orib) if, on the evidence available, the proceedings would not be justified.
