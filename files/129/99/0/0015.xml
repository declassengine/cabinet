(59) 1655th November, 1959.CABINETESTIMATES 1960-61Memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues who are in charge of spending Departments are no doubtconsidering the draft Estimates which their Departments are to send in to theTreasury by the end of this month: The Cabinet may like to be informed of thegeneral prospect for next year as I see it at present.2. Until these Estimates reach the Treasury, I shall not have any more detailed figures than those I set out in C. (59) 108. But pending the result of my colleagues&apos;efforts to reduce their Estimates below the forecast figures, I have no reason atpresent to expect that proposals for expenditure next year will be very different from the alarming forecast which I gave last July. I had to point out then thatSupply expenditure for 1960-61 was estimated at no less than  315 millions (7 percent.) higher than in the current year&apos;s Estimates. The forecast demand for defencestood in July at  1,683 millions, and  1,620 millions has since then been agreed as the figure within which the Service Departments are to submit their Estimates.But this reduction is likely to be at least offset by increases which were not includedin the July figures (e.g., cotton, assistance for local unemployment, doctors&apos; and dentists&apos; pay, &amp;c).3. We estimated the above-the-line surplus at the time of the last Budget at 102 millions. Can we expect revenue to increase enough to keep us in surplusabove the line i.e., will it increase by over  200 millions? At the moment it isimpossible to tell, and we shall not have any firm forecasts until early in January.It does seem, however, that the prospects of the additional expenditure^ beingcovered by additional revenue are materially better than they were a few months ago. On the most optimistic reckoning, however, we are uncomfortably near to a surplus of zero; and the guesses we can make now could easily be falsified to an extent which would land us in deficit. We have to remember that in previous yearsrevenue has often proved to be more buoyant than was allowed for in estimatesmade at this time of year, but for the worst of all reasons an unexpectedly largedose of inflation, which has had a bigger impact on revenue than on expenditure.From now on we must all hope that this particular source of improvement in the forecast figures will no longer be there.4. On the information at present available, I can see little hope of any appreciable reductions in taxation in the next Budget, judging either by theExchequer figures themselves or by the way the economy seems likely to develop and I think that we should bear this in mind in anything we say, so as not to createfalse hopes. Indeed, so long as the economy is expanding at a normal pace andwe allow ourselves to pre-empt for increased Government expenditure the wholeof the normal increase in revenue, we can hardly expect tax reductions to bepossible at all.D.
