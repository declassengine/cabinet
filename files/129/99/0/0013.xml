C. (59) 163 COPY NO.  S 128th October, 1959CABINETEUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION:rUICK-FROZEN FI3KMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Norwegian Government have asked that frozen fish filletsshould be given &quot;industrial free trade&quot; treatment in the European free trade Association (E. F. T. A. ), i. e. , that the tariff (10 per cent) should beremoved in regular steps over ten years in accordance with the schedulefor industrial products generally, beginning with a reduction to 8 per centon 1st July, I960.    &quot;Industrial free trade&quot; treatment also implies that therules of fair competition must be observed - in particular, no direct or indirect subsidy to exports.2. On 26th October the European Economic Association committee agreed that we could not accept this, and that the Cabinet should be askedto decide whether we should reject the request or whether we shouldexplore the possibility of a special arrangement with the Scandinavians bywhich we should remove the tariff on condition that they agreed voluntarilyto limit their exports to us.    It would also be understood that the wholearrangement would be abrogated if, as a result of the next World Conferenceon the Law of the Sea, the other members of the E. F. T. A. extended theirfishing limits.3. Proposals on these lines were mentioned tentatively and without commitment at last weelds meeting of the Minister of Agriculture and thePresident of the Board of Trade with Norwegian Ministers.4. Under these proposals, quick-frozen fillets would not be getting&quot;industrial free trade&quot; treatment in E. F. T. A. , and the rules of faircompetition would not affect them.    There would therefore be no danger that our whitefish subsidy would come under fire.5. Sir John Coulson, the official responsible for the E. F. T.A.negotiations, has now replied to the telegram that we sent after Monday&apos;smeeting of the European Economic Association Committee.    His replyis attached as Annex A.6. Annex B sets out draft instructions to be sent to our delegation in Stockholm if the Cabinet decides to take this course.    The point in square brackets in paragraph 9 is still under consideration.7. It will be necessary to inform South Africa immediately, if we make this offer to Norway. They have a 10 per cent guaranteed preferenceon fresh hake, and they may regard thi3 as being infringed by our offer.-1-SECRET(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
The technical question is difficult, and we should not necessarily agree withthem.    This is clearly a case for full and prompt consultation, and we mustnot publish any agreement until we have heard from them.    The Canadianswill also feel that their interests are potentially damaged, although thereis no infringement of their rights, and will of course look for earlyliberalisation of fresh and frozen fish.8. Definitions and background material are included in Annex C.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.23th October, 1959.-2-
ANNEX a reply RECEIVED FROM SIR JOHN COULSON(TELEGRAM NO. 457 FROM STOCKHOLM)Delay in our instructions about fish was received better here than   had expected.    This was perhaps because there was a remarkablespirit of conciliation yesterday and we had made much more rapid progress than hitherto.     Nevertheless Norwegian delegate warned methat this would cause delay over the whole fielcl since his instructions were to &quot;look sour&quot; until they had a reply on /   ? group omitted/.2.      I sounded the Norwegian delegate about the suggestion made inLondon.    He was not very definite, but did not appear to rule out theidea of a gentlemen^ agreement limiting exports;   but he asked whetherit was our intention to have the same arrangements with other countries,particularly the Danes, or how we expected to manage this.    If therewere separate arrangements one country could send supplies via another country so exporting its total allocation.    As regards the possibility of holding concessions in suspense pending conclusion of internationalarrangement covering the whole fish problem, he said Norway could hardly be expected to take the initiative in putting forward proposals ofthis kind.     Here again, however, he did not entirely rule the possibilityout.    I think it is clear the Norwegians will not themselves make a move on either point.3.     If you decide to make no further concessions, I would expect thesituation to develop as follows:-(a) The whole question of fish would have to be fought out at ministerial meeting next month.(b) We should be unable to settle on a number of otherwisesoluble problems.    The Norwegians would certainly holdout on such questions as revenue duties, where theyhave a very long list of items on which they have not yetagreed that duties should rank as tariffs and thereforebe reduced and eliminated before totals.    Norwegianobstruction would in its turn prevent concessions by others.(c) Thus, there would be too many outstanding points for ministers to settle and (unless of course the wholeagreement broke down) Ministers would not at thismeeting be able to approve the Convention and therewould have to be a further round of official negotiations.(d) At the moment the atmosphere is good in spite of the strain. But it will be greatly soured if agreement were only reached as the result of a bitter strugglewith the Norwegians.4.     I will telegraph further tomorrow if there are any significantdevelopments affecting your decision.
annex draft INSTRUCTIONS TO UNITED kingdom delegation AT STOCKHOLMNORWEGIAN FISHMinisters have considered farther in the light of your telegramNo. 457. You are authorised to settle with the Norwegians and Danesand, if necessary, the Swedes on the basis of this telegram.2.      We are prepared to remove the tariff on quick-frozen fish fillets,provided that the Scandinavians are prepared to make special arrange-mentc with us to limit voluntarily their exports to the United Kingdom.It must be understood also that the tariff could be reimposed if, fqllow-ing the ne.-r.t World Conference on the Law of the Sea, the other partiesto these arrangements (including the Faroes and Greenland if they are brought mv.c        ElttX-cpoaw Free Trade Association) extended theirfx siring luruts against us.3.     Our official trade figures are not broken down sufficiently to identify the details of this trade, but the Whitefish Authority estimates that Scandinavian exports of quick-frozen fillets to the United Kingdom in1958 were about 4, 500 tons, of which 750 from Norway and 2,800 from denmark and 950 mainly from Swedish companies operating in norway and Denmark.4.     If the Scandinavians are prepared to negotiate on the basis ofparagraph 2 above, you may tell them that if the market continues to expand we should be willing to see our imports of quick-frozen filletsfrom Scandinavia gradually increase up to an ultimate maximum of20,000 tons.    It would-be necessary to ensure that this was done in an orderly way, and it would have to be agreed that, if our imports in theyear July, I960 to June, 1961, or in the year July, 1961 to June, 1962,seemed likely to exceed 7, 500 tons, a voluntary limitation would be imposed accordingly by the exporting countries.    There would be a regular process of consultation to establish the voluntary limits to be imposed by the exporters, if necessary, in subsequent years to moderate the rate of growth.5.     Quick-frozen fillets would not be receiving industrial free tradetreatment, and we should not wish them to do so because of possible repercussions on our whitefish subsidy.     But from the tariff point ofview we should regard the proposed arrangement as broadly analogous to industrial free trade treatment, and we would expect the tariffreduction to be carried out according to the normal industrial pattern.We regard this as important.6.     Norwegian Ministers suggested in London that they might beprepared to allow United Kingdom trawlers to land fish freely for freezirin Norwegian factories, and that this would allow British firms toestablish their own freezing factories in these countries if they wishedto do so.    The Fisheries Departments see some danger in this for theUnited Kingdom fishing industry, but the principle of freedom of-1-
establishment is important in the wider European Free Trade Associationcontext.    We should accept the offer if they made it again, but we wouldnot want to pay for it.7.      You should note that South Africa has a guaranteed preference onfresh hake.    They in fact send their fish chilled or frozen, and we mayhave difficulty in carrying them with us.     You should warn the norwegians of this so that there will be no premature public disclosurebefore we havs consulted the South Africans,    We are doing this atonce.    You oJiquld al30 tell the Norwegians that the Canadians will belosing a preference.    This is not guaranteed, and we do not need their agreement, but it will be another sore point for the Canadians, who arealready critical of the European Free Trade Association.8.     If an agreement was reached on these lines for quick-frozenfillets, we should be prepared to treat canned and other processed fishas coming within the industrial free trade arrangements, and we shouldbe prepared to agree to a general provision for consultation about freshfish analogous to the draft agricultured clauses.9.      We accept Norwegian definition of quick-frozen fillets as including all forms of quick-frozen fish except whole fish or steaks offish 1^ and also including quick-frozen peeled shrimps and prawns/.-2-
ANNEX CBACKGROUND FACTS AND FIGURES RELATINGTO CUICK-FROZEN FISH&quot;Quick-frozen fillets&quot; mean to the Norwegians virtually all formsof quick-frozen fish except whole fish or steaks of fish.    Quick-frozenfillets as so defined enter the fishmongering and fishfrying trades aswet, i. e. , as fresh, fish, and also the catering and institutional(hospitals, schools and such) trades;  and also the grocery trade in thespecial form of quick-frozen consumer packs.2.     Quick-frozen fillets from Norway are mainly of cod and haddockand from Denmark mainly of plaice, and both alike compete directly with the white fish catch by all sections of the British fleets.    the norwegians also include quick-frozen peeled shrimps and prawns intheir definition of quick-frozen fillets and these compete with the catchof the British inshore fleets.3.     The offer already made to Norway to remove the duties fromcanned and processed fish would increase from a present figure of44 per cent to 71 per cent the proportion of Norwegian fish and marineproducts with duty-free access to the United Kingdom market.    As muchas 95 per cent of total Norwegian exports to the United Kingdom will thenbe duty-free.4.      Within the European Free Trade Association , the suppliers orpotential supplies of quick-frozen fillets to the United Kingdom are Norway,Denmark and her dependencies of the Faroe Islands and Greenland, andin lesser measure Sweden.    If Iceland were to join the European Free trade association she must also be included.    The total white fish catch ofthese countries, excluding Iceland, is about 1,200,000 tons a year (the icelandic figure is 400,000).    The United Kingdom white fish catch isabout 900,000 tons a year.    At present United Kingdom imports of quick-frozen fillets from European Free Trade Association countries are about ,500 tons a year, the annual rate of increase being about 750 tons;but quick-frozen fish is replacing fresh fish and the catch figures showthat supplies of fish will not be a limiting factor in the increase ofScandinavian exports to the United Kingdom.October, 1959.
