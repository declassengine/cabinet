(o AQ confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTQUESTIONS OF PROCEDURE FOR ministers. Cabinet ProcedurePreparation of Business for the Cabinet1.  The business of the Cabinet consists, in the main, of:  -   (i) Questions which engage the collective responsibility of the Government,either because they raise major issues of policy or because they arelikely to occasion public comment or criticism,(ii) Questions on which there is an unresolved conflict of interest between departments.All questions involving more than one Department should be examined inter-departmentally, before submission to Cabinet, so that the decisions required maybe clearly defined. When there is a conflict of interest between Departments, itshould not be referred to the Cabinet until all other means of resolving it have been exhausted, including personal correspondence or discussion between the ministers concerned.2.   Proposals v/hich involve expenditure or affect general financial or economicpohcy should be discussed with the Treasury-and, if agreement cannot be reached-   between officials, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer-before they are submitted-to the Cabinet or to a Ministerial Committee; and the results of those discussionstogether with the best possible estimate of the cost to the Exchequer, should be_ indicated in the memorandum, (iteviaed by direction of the P.I.I. 8.8.60 )not be brought to Cabinet at all. A precise aenriirTorrorsiicn--rnati:crs-caiiuui ucgiven, and in borderline cases a Minister is well advised to bring the matter before his colleagues.&apos;4. These rules do not limit the right of Ministers to submit to the cabinet memoranda setting out their views on general issues of policy.5.   When a Minister wishes to raise a matter orally at the Cabinet, the PrimeMinisters consent should be sought through the Secretary of the Cabinet.6. Memoranda for the Cabinet should be as brief and as clear as possible.Time spent in making a memorandum short and clear will be saved many times overin reading and in discussion; and it is the duty of Ministers to ensure that this is done by personal scrutiny and, where, necessary, revision of memoranda submittedto them by their officials.The model memorandum explains at the outset&apos;what the problem is, indicatesbriefly the relevant considerations, and concludes with a precise statement of thedecisions sought. It is sometimes useful to include a summary of the main pointsbrought out in the body of the memorandum, but such a summary should neverexceed a few lines. Prefatory covering notes should be avoided. To facilitatereference in discussion, paragraphs should be numbered.If it is necessary to refer repeatedly to a body with a long title, an abbreviatedversion may be used if on the first mention the full title is given and the abbreviationadded in brackets, e.g., &quot; The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) &quot;.7. Save with the Prime Minister^ permission, which will be granted only for reasons of extreme urgency, a memorandum may not be set down on the agenda for discussion by the Cabinet until two working days after it was circulated.8. Cabinet memoranda (as distinct from memoranda for Cabinet Committees)are normally reproduced by the Cabinet Office, the text being sent by the originatingDepartment to the Cabinet Office for the purpose. If for any reason a cabinet memorandum is reproduced by. the originating Department, all copies should be sentto the Cabinet Office, and application should be made to the Cabinet Office for any additional copies required by the reproducing Department.

J confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPFr^v OF HER BRJTANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTQUESTIONS OF PROCEDURE FOR MINISTERSPreparation of Business for the Cabinet1.   The business of the Cabinet consists, in the main, of:  (i) Questions which engage the collective responsibility of the Government,either because they raise major issues of policy or because they arelikely to occasion public comment or criticism.(ii) Questions on which there is an unresolved conflict of interest between departments.All questions-involving more than one Department should be examined inter-departmentally, before submission to Cabinet, so that the decisions required maybe clearly defined.

Matters which fall wholly within the Departmental responsibility of^sjngleMinister and do not engage the collective responsibility of the Government neednot be brought to Cabinet at all. A precise definition of such matters cannot begiven, and in borderline cases a Minister is well advised to bring the matter before his colleagues.4. These rules do not limit the right of Ministers to submit to the cabinet memoranda setting out their views on general issues of policy.5. When a Minister wishes to raise a matter orally at the Cabinet, the PrimeMinisters consent should be sought through the Secretary of the Cabinet.6. Memoranda for the Cabinet should be as brief and as clear as possible.Time spent in making a memorandum short and clear will be saved many times overin reading and in discussion; and it is the duty of Ministers to ensure that this is done by personal scrutiny and, where necessary, revision of memoranda submittedto them by their officials.The model memorandum explains at the outset what the problem is, indicatesbriefly the relevant considerations, and concludes with a precise statement of thedecisions sought. It is sometimes useful to include a summary of the main pointsbrought out in the body of the memorandum, but such a summary should neverexceed a few lines. Prefatory covering notes should be avoided. To facilitatereference in discussion, paragraphs should be numbered.If it is necessary to refer repeatedly to a body with a long title, an abbreviatedversion may be used if on the first mention the full title is given and the abbreviationadded in brackets, eg.. &quot;The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) &quot;.7. Save with the Prime Ministers permission, which will be granted only for reasons of extreme urgency, a memorandum may not be set down on the agenda for discussion by the Cabinet until two working clays after it was circulated.8. Cabinet memoranda (as distinct from memoranda for Cabinet Committees)are normally reproduced by the Cabinel Office, the text being sent by the originatingDepartment to the Cabinet Office for liic purpose. If for any reason a cabinet memorandum is reproduced by the originating Department, all copies should be sentto the Cabinet Office, and application should be made to the Cabinet Office for any additional copies required by the reproducing Department. The same rule appliesI. Cabinet Procedure
be      I&quot;to memoranda reproduced by Departments for consideration by Cabinet Com-fmittees: all copies made should be sent to the Cabinet Office for circulation. If Jjan originating Department so wishes, a standing arrangement may be made whereby \the Cabinet Office will automatically supply for its use a fixed number of additional *jcopies of memoranda. ;&apos;9.   In no circumstances, other than those mentioned in the preceding para-1graph, are Cabinet memoranda to be reproduced or copied in Departments.  If a department requires additional copies of a memorandum, application must in every.j\case be made to the Cabinet Office. \IAttendance at Cabinet \10.   Cabinet meetings take precedence over all other business.  If a member kof the Cabinet, or a Minister summoned for a particular item, is unable for any \\reason to be present at a Cabinet meeting, he should notify the Secretary, who &apos;will inform the Prime Minister and will also consider whether any rearrangement iof business is required. )11.   Ministers&apos; private secretaries can help the Secretary of the Cabinet by 1indicating, when asking for a subject to be placed on the Cabinefs Agenda, which&apos;;Ministers other than members of the Cabinet are likely to be concerned, so that,&apos;arrangements may be made for their attendance.12.   The Prime Ministers Private Secretary is responsible for ensuring that theproceedings of the Cabinet are not disturbed. To assist him, Ministers should give jinstructions that messages are not to be sent to them while in Cabinet unless they.;lare so urgent thai they cannot wait until the end of the meeting.&apos; 13. The Secretary should be informed of Ministers&apos; out-of-town engagements,ai 1 also of their week-end and holiday arrangements so that, if some suddenemergency arises, he may be able to inform the Prime Minister at once which ministers are immediately available.Cabinet Conclusions14.   The record of the Cabinefs proceedings is limited to the decisions taken fand such summary of the discussion as may be necessary for the guidance of those jjwho hajt^J:o take action on them.  The Secretary is under instructions to avoid,so far as practicable, recording the opinions expressed by particular Ministers.Matters of exceptional secrecy may be recorded in a Confidential Annex.15. Any suggestions for amendment of Cabinet Conclusions must reach theSecretary not later than the next day but one following that on which the meeting was held.  Thereafter the Conclusions will be sent to be printed.16. Ministers are responsible for giving such instructions to their Departments Mas may be necessary to give effect to the Conclusions of the Cabinet, and for com-&apos;!communicating to subordinate Departments or branches decisions of which they should be made aware. Where an urgent matter arises in Cabinet unexpectedly, and alldecision is reached requiring immediate action by a Department not represented if at the meeting, the Secretary will ensure that the Department concerned is notifiedHforthwith.17. When a Department has to take action upon, or is otherwise directly!affected by, a particular Conclusion, the actual decisions of the Cabinet on lhat;&apos;ffimatter may be copied in the Department, together with so much of the record of theHdiscussion as is essential to a proper understanding of them, and these extracts mayij&apos;be passed to responsible officers in the Department, as may be necessary. Thcj!distribution of such extracts within a Department should be limited to the occasions)on which it is strictly necessary for the efficient discharge of public business, and ^care should be taken to see that-extracts arc sent only to those officers of the Departmerit who need be acquainted with the actual terms of the decision. Where action;!has to be taken at once by a Department, application may be made to the Secretary1^for an advance copy of the relevant Conclusions. jReturn of Cabinet Documents18. Cabinet documents are the properly of the Crown. Ministers relinquish-ing office should hand over to their successors those Cabinet documents which arerequired for current administration and should return all others to the Cabinet&apos;^
Office. A former Minister may at any lime have access in the Cabinet Office to.- copies of Cabinet or Cabinet Committee papers issued ,to him while in office.To facilitate the recovery of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers and to; ensure their safe custody Ministers are asked during -their tenure of office to arranges for the regular return to the Cabinet Office (at intervals of, say, three to six months)* of such Cabinet documents as are not required for current administration,i ;v.-.On a change of Government, the outgoing Prime Minister issues speciali instructions about the disposal of the Cabinet papers of his Administration.Cabinet Committees19. The procedure outlined above applies mutatis mutandis .to ministerial committees of the Cabinet.While Committee meetings provide a useful forum for the discussion of policyand for enabling Ministers to ensure that their points of view are understood andto make a contribution to the formulation of policy, their prime object is thedespatch of business and the making of decisions. Attendance should be restricted to the permanent members and other Ministers who have a major interest in thequestion under discussion.Collective Responsibility20.   Decisions reached by the Cabinet or Cabinet Committees are normallyannounced and defended by the Minister concerned as his own decisions.  There;  may be rare occasions when it is desirable to emphasise the importance of some decision by stating specifically that it is the decision of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.:&apos; This, however, should be the exception rather than the rule.  The growth of any,   pneral practice whereby decisions of the Cabinet or of Cabinet Committees were a nounced as such would lead to the embarrassing result that some decisions ofgovernment would be regarded as less authoritative than others.   Critics of adecision reached by a particular Committee could press for its review by someother Committee or by the Cabinet, and the constitutional right of iTrdWidualMinisters to speak in the name of the Government as a whole would be impaired.21. The method adopted by Ministers for discussion among themselves of questions of policy is essentially a domestic matter, and is no concern of parliament or the public. The doctrine of collective responsibility of Ministers depends, inpractice, upon the existence of opportunities for free and frank discussion betweenthem, and such discussion is hampered if the processes by which it is carried onare laid bare. For these reasons it is also the general practice to avoid, so far aspossible, disclosing the composition and terms of reference of Cabinet Committeesand, in particular, the identity of their Chairmen.II.-Precautions against Unauthorised Disclosures of Information22. Disclosures in the Press of matters under discussion by the Cabinet or its Committees damage the reputation of the Government and impair the efficiency of its administration.23. .Ministers who share the collective responsibility for the governments programme must be kept generally aware of the development of important aspects-, of Government policy. But outside this narrow circle knowledge of these mattersf should be confined to those, whether Ministers or officials, who arc assisting inI the formulation or execution of the particular policy concerned, or need to knowI what is afoot because of its effect on other aspects of public business for whichthey are responsible.24.   Government policy should not be discussed with persons outsideGovernment service unless this is necessary for the transaction of public business.0 Care should be taken to see that no discussions of Government policy are held in places where they may be overheard.25. Ministers are personally responsible for ensuring that all members oftheir staffs understand the need for exercising the strictest discretion, and for seeingCONFIDENTIAL55896 l! 2
ethat the appropriate precautions are strictly observed in their Department.  Thefollowing considerations should be borne in mind:  (i). While it-is--within the discretion of Ministers to decide which of their, ,,r\ --advisers onsubordinates should be shown Cabinet papers, the normal1 ,. rule is.that such papers should not be seen by any save their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy.  In particular, Cabinet..i ,., :     papers should not be circulated as a matter of course to Information-&apos;       Officers or, their staffs.;&apos;v.&quot;&apos; (ii) A Minister who is a member of the Cabinet has responsibilities wider\:-f than those of his own Department, and will in that capacity receive some documents which are of no concern to any of his subordinates.(iii) A Parliamentary Private Secretary is not a member of the Government;and the information given to him should be correspondingly limited-Only exceptionally, and with the express authority of his Minister,should he be shown Cabinet or Cabinet Committee papers or othersecret official papers. The information given to him should be limitedto what is strictly necessary for the discharge of his Parliamentary andpolitical duties.(iv) Documents reflecting the personal views of Ministers are in a specialcategory, and their handling requires special care. It is contrary tothe doctrine of collective responsibility to make known the attitude of individual Ministers on matters of policy.(v) If occasions arise on which it is necessary that any considerable numberof officers should be consulted on particular issues arising out of cabinet memoranda, this should he done by means of minutes addressed to theofficers concerned, confined to the particular points on which they arerequired to advise, thus avoiding a wide circulation of the memorandathemselves.(vi) Experience has shown that leakages of information have often occurredas a result of the skilful piecing together, by representatives of-the Press,of isolated scraps of information gathered from several sources, eachin itself apparently of little importance. The only safe rule is, therefore,never to mention such matters even in the form of guarded allusions,&quot;--^except to those who must -be informed of them for reasons of State,until the time has come when disclosure, in whole or in part, is-authorised. - Reasons of State may require, in appropriate cases, the confidential communication of some information to a responsible editor,lobby correspondent, &amp;c, for purposes of guidance; but such communication is only justified where it can be assured -that theconfidence and the terms on which it is made are respected.26. Secrecy cannot, however, be secured solely by rules restricting the circulation of papers. Public business cannot be transacted without a fairly widedissemination of confidential information, within Government circles, and theessential need is for the observance of a high standard of discretion by all whoacquire knowledge of such information in the course of their duties an attitude of mind which puts first the interests of the Government as a whole and subordinateseverything to that end. It is the duty of Ministers to set this standard of discretion in regard to all confidential matters which come within their knowledge, to give an example to others, and to see that their example is followed.III.-Transmission of Classified Documents27. Ministers find it necessary, on occasion, to have documents sent Lo them at addresses out of London. The rules which govern the transmission of official documents between towns are set out in Chapter IV, paragraphs 17 and 18, of thehandbook &quot; Security in Government Department &quot;. It should, in particular, benoted that secret documents may be sent between towns by the hand of aGovernment courier or despatch rider or, exceptionally, if this cannot be arranged,by registered post. The Post Office do not-accept despatch boxes or locked pouchesas registered items.  But they make special arrangements for the transmission of
29. In public speeches Ministers should exercise special.care in.referring toII;&apos;;:subjects which are the responsibility of other Ministers. They should.keep withinp;-/.,the ambit of approved Government policy, and should not anticipate decisions notKfl&apos;;&apos;yet made public. In all cases of doubt they should consult the -Minister concerned.30. . The Foreign Office should always be consulted before any mention is madeflK: of matters affecting foreign affairs or relations with foreign Powers; and Ministerspi,&quot;wishing to refer to matters of defence policy should in all cases first consult theWr. Minister of Defence. Ministers should also be specially careful in .referring to  &quot;-matters affecting our relations with self-governing Commonwealth countries, or to!&amp;vthe political aspects of Colonial affairs (e.g., self-government in certain Colonies)and on these points should consult the Commonwealth Secretary or colonial secretary respectively, unless the matter to be mentioned falls wholly within their&apos;/.:/&apos; own responsibility.31.   In the present international situation special care is needed in conver-sations at social functions at Embassies or at other functions at which foreignII; diplomatic representatives are present.  If matters of foreign policy-^re discussedlli.-:&apos;.at such functions, a note should be made afterwards of the salient poults of the$&quot;conversation and a copy sent to the Foreign Secretary.-&apos; 32. Unless they have first obtained the agreement of the Leader of the House%  of Commons, Ministers should avoid saying anything which might affect the.programme of Government business in Parliament. Thus, they should not withoutv  his agreement promise White Papers, the publication of which might result in ademand for a special debate; and legislation should never be promised without thei;   express approval of the Cabinet or the Legislation Committee.. 33. Ministers should use official machinery for distributing texts oflv Ministerial speeches only when such speeches are made on official occasions.&apos;:\, By-Elections and Local Government Elections&amp;..- . 34. Members of the Cabinet should not normally speak at by-elections; but &apos; other Ministers, including those of Cabinet-rank, may do so. As a general rule1&apos;r&apos; Ministers above the rank of Parliamentary Secretary should not speak at&apos; local&quot;&apos; government elections. There may, however, be occasions on which a1 Minister mayjV:&apos; feel obliged to do so for special reasons, particularly in his own constituency.1^ Broadcasting Arrangements &apos;       -I&apos;;;-. 35. The following notes on broadcasts by Ministers have to be read againstthe background that the decision whether a person is to broadcast rests with the broadcasting authorities. There is no legal sanction or forma! agreement or&apos;(v anything else which requires them to accept a particular broadcaster. StrictlyIt speaking, therefore, there must be an invitation. It can, of course, take the formp of a favourable response to a request, an acquiescense in a suggestion, or an actualp.... invitation by the Corporation on its own initiative. Whatever the .form, it is inpv essence an invitation by the broadcasting authority. .I&quot;-      5&amp;.

IV. Ministerial Speeches, Broadcasts, &amp;c.
CONFIDENTIAL W \    b&amp; &apos;c^.^.^, A^^iV fl.io.6i J3^Broadcasting by Ministers is, in large part, subject to agreements betweenthe major political parties, which provide for:5f;   (a) Party Political Broadcasts on sound and television on a quota basis.  Thearrangements are made by the Chief Whip on decisions made by theI&quot;-; v- Prime Minister.^j&apos;;; (b) Budget Broadcasts- (i.e., by the Chancellor -of the Exchequer, and amember of the Opposition in reply) which are to be regarded as aspecial series of Party Political Broadcasts.   The arrangements aremade by, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and through the usual&apos;. channels.\i    (c) &quot; Ministerial Broadcasts &quot;. These are now extremely rare.   They are&apos;   described as being &quot;purely factual or explanatory of legislation or administrative policies approved by Parliament, or in the nature of11^&apos;*.I -.&quot; appeals to the nation to co-operate in national policies, such as fuel11economy or recruiting, which require the active participation of the ^T&apos;1!^&apos;public. Broadcasts on State occasions also come in the same category c^TiWBy the present practice these are made only on the BBC services, and&apos;^^^&apos;^ 4the arrangements with the BBC provide for a right of reply when theOpposition successfully claim that the Minister has been controversial..Ministers wishing to broadcast should communicate with the Chancellor^ v;- - crfiiTC7DTrctry--of Lancasterjivho will be responsible for obtaining the&apos;&apos; , . Prime Ministers approval,x  37.   The agreements referred to above do not preclude the broadcasting authorities from inviting whom they please, including Ministers, to broadcast on sound and television.  Such broadcasts by Ministers fall, with few exceptions, into two categories, broadcasts in news bulletins and broadcasts in magazine and featureprogrammes..  (d) Broadcasts in News Bulletins. It is at the discretion of each Minister todecide whether he should accept an invitation to be interviewed on a&quot; news&quot; occasion.  But care is necessary to ensure that such interviewsare, in fact, no more than news reports and do not develop intostatements or arguments which would justify a &quot; right to reply &quot;.Ministers who accept such invitations should notify the &apos;&apos;Gh an assort.Rw^te. 4 .of the Duchy-of Lancaster-   If a Minister is in doubt whether??-      Hcv^J^proposed broadcast would constitute a news report or something more,he should consult the O-hnnccllor of the Duchy of Lancaster. fct.Ls&amp;* ^ tkuow^ -(e) Magazhie and Feature Programmes. The object of these programmes(especially on television) is as much to entertain as to inform,, and-entertainment value is often sought by stimulating a clash of personalityand opinions.   A Minister will rarely appear in a setting of his ownchoosing, and indeed the programme may be introduced in a manner which weights the scales against him.   He may well be only one   .participant of a number, with the flow of argument and discussiondirected to ensure liveliness.   Moreover, it is in principle undesirable that Ministers should be involved too often in debating important matters of policy in this kind of forum: the proper place for suchdebates is Parliament.   On the other hand, circumstances may arise which make it desirable for a Minister to take part.   Because of thedifficulties involved in this kind of broadcast, Ministers should not accept invitations to take part without the approval of. the PrimeMinister.  This should be sought through the GhtmeeHor-of-t-he duchy^n^sti. J\ .of-Latteaster, who will be responsible for obtaining the Prime ministers approval.  The Ministers Private Secretary should therefore write tothe Private Secretary of the GhftireeUe-F-of the Duchy nf 1 anrast?rklVlvMj, f\outlining the scope of the proposed broadcast and (where appropriate)      iw-Ofthe line the Minister intends to take.   A copy of this letter should besent to the Prime Ministers Private Secretary.if) There are occasions on which Ministers are invited to take part inbroadcasts in a private and not a Ministerial capacity.   Nevertheless,the Prime Minister^ prior approval should be obtained before suchinvitations are accepted.   It should be sought directly from the Prime&apos; Minister or through his Private Secretary.38.   Broadcasting by sound and by television is a useful instrument forconveying the British point of view to people in other countries.   But before ministers commit themselves to making broadcasts outside the United Kingdomthey should first consult the Foreign Secretary (or the Commonwealth secretary or Colonial Secretary as appropriate) and any other  Minister who may be concerned with the subject of the broadcast. They should then seek the permission of the Prime Minister. - -If Ministers are invited to broadcast while on a visit to another country theyshould seek the advice of Her Majesty&apos;s representative in that country.
-. tf^vfaisters^eJlavited-tcUaroadshoufd-seek-4he^dAqG*^f-Her--Majest-y^s-re^accenting. the. invitation, ..&apos; 39.&apos; Ministers should not accept payment for &apos; broadcasts by sound or.&apos;television unless it is clear, and will be clear to the audience, that they are speakingin a private capacity on subjects which have no connexion with their Ministerialduties. If Ministers have any doubt about the propriety of accepting payment forany particular broadcast, they may consult the Prime Minister^ Private Secretary.V. Press Articles and Interviews by MinistersPress Articles40. Ministers are precluded from the practice of journalism in any form:but this prohibition does not extend to authorship or to writings of a literary,historical, scientific, philosophical or romantic character. For these there are numerous and respectable precedents. ...41. This rule need not be interpreted as debarring a Minister fromcontributing an article or a letter to a newspaper, on occasion, for the purpose of supplementing other means of informing the public about the work of his department. In deciding whether to write an article, a Minister should bear inmind his obligations to Parliament: for example, he should not discuss a Bill before it has received its Second Reading in the House of Commons.. Ministers should not accept payment for such articles. While a Minister may occasionally write a letterto a newspaper, it is not in general desirable that Ministers should engage incontroversy in the correspondence columns of the Press. A Minister should not inany event do so without first obtaining the Prime Minister^ authority.42. &quot;his rule governs dealings with the foreign as well as the home Press.Party Publications43. The rule in paragraph 40 does not debar Ministers from contributing tothe publications of the political organisations with which they are associated.Payment should-not be accepted for such articles.Interviews44. A Minister may decide in his discretion whether he should grant specialinterviews to individual Press representatives, bearing in mind that an interviewgranted to a representative of a single newspaper or agency may arouse jealousyin the rest of the Press. As a general rule, the same considerations apply tointerviews as to written articles (see paragraph 41 above).VI. Parliamentary Private Secretaries45. Parliamentary Private Secretaries occupy a special position which is not always understood by the general public, either at home or abroad. They arenot members of the Government, and should be careful to avoid being spoken of as such. They are Private Members, and should therefore be afforded as great a liberty of action as possible; but their close and confidential association with ministers necessarily imposes certain obligations on them, and has led to thegenerally accepted practice set out in the following paragraph.46. Parliamentary Private Secretaries should not make statements in theHouse or put Questions on matters affecting the Department with which they are connected. They should also exercise great discretion in any speeches or broadcastswhich they may make outside the House, taking care not to make statements which appear to be made in an official or semi-official capacity, and bearing in mind atthe same time that, however careful they may be to make it clear that they arespeaking only as Private Members, they arc, nevertheless, liable to be regarded asspeaking with some of the authority which attaches to a member of theGovernment. Generally they must act with a sense of responsibility and with discretion; and they must not associate themselves with particular groupsadvocating special policies. :   ..
VIII. Parliamentary Statements and PapersStatements after Questionsi -. . 50. &apos;. When.Parliaraent is in session important announcements of government policy, should&apos;.bt made,in the first instance, in Parliament. But, if too -many,announcements, are, ,made&apos;.at the end of Questions, Parliamentary business isimpeded,-Furthermore- if. they are too frequent or too long their effect is bluntedand-they may.not receive adequate publicity in the Press. Ministers proposing&apos;tomake a- statement after&apos; Questions, whether or not related to a Question-on, theOrder Paper, or-&apos;to answer a Question at the end of Questions, are therefore maskedto.-conform with;the following procedure:(fl)The;earliest possible notice should begiven to the Prime Ministers private secretary, who will consult as necessary with the Leader of the HouseVII.-Absence of Ministers&apos;from the United Kingdom.47...-,Any member of the Cabinet or Minister in charge of a.Department who wishes to..be absent from.theUnited, Kingdom, whether on duty, or leave, should.take,;,the following :Steps:(i)j;The Foreign Secretary, Commonwealth Secretary or Colonial Secretary.(as&apos;^appropriate)should - be&apos;!&quot;consulted.&apos;&apos; - Concurrently&apos;&apos; the PrimeMinister^ Private;Secretary&apos;should&apos;be informed that a visit is underconsideration.* (ii) The Prime Ministers approval should then be obtained.(hi) After the-Prime&apos; Miriistery approval has been obtained, the minister should seek-the Queen&apos;s permission to leave the country. At the sametime Her Majesty should be informed of the-arrangements made forthe-administration;of the Ministers Office during his absence.Other Ministers who propose to leave the United Kingdom, whether on duty or on leave, need not. obtain the Queen&apos;s. permission to do so. They should,,however, after obtaining thcconsent of their own Minister, take the action at (i)and (ii) above.48.When a Minister is to be away from London, his Parliamentary secretary will&apos;normally take:Ministerial charge of the Department. On some occasions,however,-/ it may ; be desirable that arrangements should be made for another minister -of: Cabinet rank-to hold himself available to give political guidance to officials&apos;&apos; of r the Department and to represent the Departments interests in discussions&apos;in Cabinet or Cabinet Committees. Any such arrangements, if notinitiated by the Prime Minister, should have his prior approval.When one Minister of Cabinet rank is acting in this way on behalf of another,special, care must be taken over the exercise of statutory powers. With some- exceptions the powers of a Secretary of State can be exercised by another Secretaryof State; and the powers of a Board or Council may be exercisable in the absenceof its principal member. But for the most part the powers of a Minister cannotbe exercised by a Minister in charge of another Department; and a Minister who is-acting for an absent colleague should be careful to avoid appearing formally toeXerase powers which are expressed by statute as exercisable by his colleague.There is no similar difficulty about submissions to Her Majesty. Submissions&apos;made in the absence of a Minister should be made by his Parliamentary secretary of he is a&apos;Privy Counsellor; if he is not, they may be made by another Minister ofCabinet rank. Submissions on behalf of an absent Secretary of State must bemade by&apos;another Secretary of State. Submissions on behalf of the First Lord ofthe Admiralty may be made in his absence by the Senior Lord Commissioner.&apos;49. Occasional visits by Ministers to territories and services overseas forwhich they are responsible (e.g., a visit by a Colonial Office Minister to a Colonyor by an Admiralty Minister to a Royal Naval establishment overseas) may properly be charged to public funds. Ministers should not, however, charge to public fundsthe cost of visits to other countries made for the purpose of observing the workingof.a Government service abroad analogous to that for which they are responsible in,the United&apos; Kingdom.
IX.- Foreign Affairs53.   Ministers should remember the importance of sending to the foreign secretary a note of the salient points of any discussions which they may have with representatives of foreign States.  This applies to private discussions as well: as those held in the course of official business.8&quot;&quot;j^;; X.--Civil Servants and Political ConferencesT?fc:vVL54. Ministers should not ask civil servants to attend, still less to take partllin/-party political conferences. There is a standing rule in the Civil Service- thatpl&apos;bivil servants in their official capacity should not accept invitations to conferences&apos;p&apos; convened by, or under the aegis of, political organisations.&apos; To preserve the^reputation of the Civil Service for being completely immune from Party allegiance,ljf&apos;it is equally important that no civil servant should be in attendance at Party[^&quot;occasions.  If a Minister wishes to have a brief to explain any of his departmentalM activities, there is no reason why a brief should not be provided, but neither thepi&apos;author of the brief nor an Information Officer should be present at the conferencepf .or meeting.6: CONFIDENTIALWi.:-:    55896 c&apos; of Commons and with the Chief Whip.  Particulars should be given ofthe subject matter of the proposed statement, the date on which.it is;&quot;     desired to make it, and the grounds for making it on that date and for.   &quot;        adopting this method of announcement.  It should also be statedwhether the announcement has been approved by the Cabinet or by oneiv.,.:,.;-      of its Committees.(b) Copies of the draft statement should be sent as soon as it is available to; : . .    the Prime Minister, to the Leader of the House of Commons and to theChief Whip.  These copies should arrive not later than 10 a.m.- on theday on which the statement is to be made.f (c) It is at times desirable that a copy of such a statement should be shown to the Opposition shortly before it is made. If this is desired, a copyof the final text should reach the office of the Chief Whip in the Houseof Commons as early as possible and in any case not later than 2 p.m.on the day on which the statement is to be made.W) A copy of the final text should in all cases be sent to the Speaker.(e) It may sometimes be expedient that a corresponding statement should bemade simultaneously in the House of Lords. Ministers should, where necessary, consult the Leader of the House of Lords on this point.Publication of White Papers- . 51. Similar considerations apply to the publication of White Papers andother documents of.a like nature. There are, of course, some White Papers inrespect of which, because they are of a routine character or of minor importance,no i roblem of public presentation arises. In most circumstances, however, the timing of publication is important, not least in order to avoid clashes with other government publications, statements, or announcements. Therefore, with anyWhite Paper or similar document the presentation of which is important, ministers are asked to apply the procedure laid down for statements, after Questions inparagraph 50(a) above, even though publication may have been approved -b-y^heCabinet.52. Care must be taken to avoid any possibility of an infringement ofParliamentary privilege when publicity arrangements are made for White Papers.The accepted practice is for final revised proof copies of White Papers to be madeavailable to Lobby correspondents somewhat in advance of their being laid in the vote Office and for Ministers to hold a Lobby Conference if they think it desirable.The Prime Minister^ Adviser on Public Relations should be consulted if there is any question of a wider advance distribution than this. Such wider distribution e.g., to industrial correspondents is to be avoided save in exceptional circumstances.
1 The situation is, of course,, different where a Minister requires officials to bein attendance, not to.be present at the Conference or to take.part in its business,but to enaolehim to carry out urgent departmental work%$o0$Ci&amp; ^VvXL-Ministers&apos;Private Interests   ... .;55.&apos;&apos;- The. principles which should guide Ministers in deciding whether they; may&quot; properly continue to hold Company Directorships and similar offices havebeen; stated, from; time .to time in the House of Commons, as by Sir HenryCampbell-Bannerman in March 1906, and by Mr. Chamberlain in July 1939. the conventions at present to be observed are set out below.i !.-:&apos;56.:VJt.is a principle of public life that Ministers must so order their affairs that no conflict arises, or appears to arise, between their private interests andtheir public duties.Such a conflict may arise if a Minister takes an active part in any undertaking\which may have contractual or other relations with a Government Department,more particularly with his own Department. It may arise, not only if the minister has a financial interest in such an undertaking, but also if he is actively associatedwith any body, even of a philanthropic character, which might have negotiationsor other dealings with the Government or be involved in disputes with it.Furthermore Ministers should be free to give full attention to their official duties,and they should not engage in other activities which might be thought to distracttheir attention from those duties. &apos;/Each Minister must decide for himself how these principles apply to him.Over much of the field, as is shown below, there are established precedents; butin my. case of doubt the Prime Minister of the day must be the final judge, and ministers should submit any such case to him for his direction.Where it is proper for a Minister to retain any private interest, it is the rule that he should declare that interest to his colleagues if they have to discuss public business in any way affecting it, and that he should entirely detach himself from theconsideration of that business. -  -.. ,,vMinisters include all members- of the Government except unpaid AssistantGovernment Whips.   ;     - .    &apos;.Directorships &apos;. . ? -&apos;- 57. Ministers must on Assuming office resign any directorships which theymay hold, whether in public or in private companies and whether the directorshipcarries remuneration or is honorary. The only exception to this rule is thatdirectorships in private companies established for the maintenance of private familyestates, and only incidentally concerned in trading, may be retained subject to this reservation that if at any time the Minister feels that conflict is likely to arise between this private interest and his public duty, he should even in those cases divesthimself of his directorship. Directorships or offices held in connexion withphilanthropic undertakings should also be resigned if there is any risk of conflictarising, between the interests of the undertakings and the Government.Shareholdings&apos;58. Ministers cannot be expected, on assuming office, to dispose of all theirinvestments. But if a Minister holds a controlling interest in any company,considerations arise which are not unlike those governing the holding ofdirectorships; and, if there is any danger of a conflict of interest, the right course is for the Minister to divest himself of his controlling interest in the. company.There may also be exceptional cases where, even though no controlling interest is involved, the actual holding.of particular shares in concerns closely associated witha Ministers own Department may create the danger of a conflict of interest. Wherea Minister considers this to be the case, he should divest himself of the holding,&quot;: : Ministers should scrupulously avoid speculative investments in securities about which they have, or may be thought&apos;to have, early or confidential information likelyto affect the price of those securities.        - .
&quot;Mancj&quot; at Lloyds  .        ...............&apos;-&apos;&apos;-;-59.f: A Minister cannot properly continue to be a &quot; name &quot;at Lloyds while holding office as Chancellor of the Exchequer, President of the Board&quot;of Trade or minister of Transport: in such case he is required .to suspend his underwritingactivities. Other Ministers need not cause their name as an underwriter to be suspended, though Ministers should not, while holding office, establish a connexionwith Lloyds without obtaining the permission of the Prime Minister.Pension Schemes .....*r-&apos;- 60. A Minister while holding office may continue to participate in a firm&apos;pension scheme in one or other of the following ways:  &apos;w -(a) His pension rights up to the date of assuming office could be frozen, nofurther contributions being payable during his tenure of office. &apos;    - -,r (b) Where his pension rights are secured by an insurance policy, the&apos;policy could be transferred to him and he could either pay future premiumshimself or have the policy converted into a fully paid up policy,(c) Provided that this can be done under the rules of the particular firm&apos;scheme, pension contributions could continue to be paid during histenure of office (which would then rank as pensionable employment forthe purposes of the scheme) so long as they were paid either:-(i) by the Minister alone; or(ii) by the Minister and the firm; or(iii) by the firm alone paying both the employer and employeecontributions.Arrangements involving the continuation of pension contributions, whether under (i), (ii) or (iii) of (c) above, should not be made unless the Minister is expectedto resume his former employment on ceasing to hold a Ministerial office.    &apos;^-^v.It must be emphasised that whatever arrangements are made they must not go outside the terms of the particular pension scheme. There would be noobjection to the alteration of the rules of a scheme so as to permit (a) or (b) above,but approval would not be given for the addition to the scheme of a special provisionallowing contributions to be continued (whether by the Minister or by the firm or partly by each) during the tenure of a Ministerial office. If Ministers have any doubt about the propriety of the arrangements they intend making, the PrimeMinisters Private Secretary may be consulted.The taxation effects of arrangements of the above types vary according tothe. particular kind of pension concerned. The Chief Inspector of Taxes(Superannuation), Somerset House, W.C. 2, would be willing to. explain the effects of any particular proposal on the taxation of both the firm and the Minister, or theMinister could, if he preferred, make his enquiry through the Financial Secretaryto the Treasury.Where pension contributions are not made under (c) above, a Minister maybe entitled to claim relief on premiums paid for a deferred annuity, subject to the limitations and conditions laid down in Part III of the Finance Act, 1956. Themaximum relief will normally be 10 per cent, of the Ministers salary (including anytaxable salary as a Member of Parliament) but reduced by the amount of any annual payments, &amp;c, which he makes and which cannot be set against other income.&apos; Ahigher limit applies to those who were born before 1916 and who do not, in respectof some other employment, either receive.a pension or retain a right to a future1&apos; pension.   The Chief Inspector of Taxes will be willing to give further information&apos; about this relief.. . XII. Acceptance by Ministers of Gifts and Services from CommercialUndertakings61. In Answers to Parliamentary Questions on 20th and 21st February, 1952,about the acceptance of gifts and services by Ministers (Hansard, Cols.,230-232and 423-424), the Prime Minister of the day stated that, although it had not been
I-12 ,    - CONFIDENTIAL&apos; \Mfound necessary to lay down specific regulations, it was well understood that no -IjMinister or public servant should accept gifts or services which would place him ;Sunderan obligation to a commercial undertaking. - -iv:h%j : &apos; &apos;^&apos;:&apos;ir.62.:;;&apos;This:&apos;is primarily a matter which must be left to the good sense ofMinisters:;&apos; But. if any Minister finds himself in doubt or difficulty over this, he ^may seek the Prime Minister^ guidance.       .    .  &apos;    .5 ,1 * -/ &apos; &apos;       -        &apos;   - jj-\ -      -      *  -       - &apos;-- ; -     &apos; .     - .&apos;A,M&apos; - -   -       . , &apos; &apos;., ... -  , XIIL-Visits to Constituencies        .:        ,63. It is the custom for Ministers when accepting invitations to visitconstituencies to inform the Members concerned. It is particularly desirable to&apos;-&apos;^give as much notice; as&apos;possible in-the. case of constituencies represented by ^Government supporters. Ministers cannot, of.course, invite Members to accompany ^them, but adequate notice&apos;will enable them to ensure that they receive invitations Mfrom local organisers to functions of an official nature. It will also enable them &apos;.-)--to make suggestions to the Minister about the inclusion in his itinerary of placeswhich it would be helpful for him to visit. 1;
