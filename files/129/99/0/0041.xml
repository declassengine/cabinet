secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government memorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the annexed paper on Nyasaland is the result of my discussions with theGovernor of Nyasaland, Sir Robert Armitage, at Dar es Salaam and represents the highest common factors of agreement.2. First, I feel the programme is too slow, although the release rate representstwice the rate Sir Robert Armitage first suggested. There are no rehabilitationproblems in the Kenya sense, and the rate of release is simply based on judgment of the security risk and can be increased or decreased as the situation requires.No serious problems so far have arisen following releases and Intelligence and security reports are not alarming. I hope therefore to step up the February and march releases and reach the hard core position by about the end of April, whenthe state of emergency might be ended.3. Secondly, I feel that 50 hard core is much too high and doubt if we couldjustify more than about 20, if that.4. Thirdly, Dr. Banda: Sir Robert Armitage now agrees we must discuss,some time, constitutional matters with Dr. Banda. If Dr. Banda could be freedas soon as the Central African Advisory Commission under the chairmanship ofLord Monckton leaves Nyasaland (the Queen Mother&apos;s visit may be a conflictingfactor) I could see him during the week&apos;s visit I contemplate to the northern territories in June. Again, I would prefer to consider his release earlier but the suggested timing may be convenient. The Chief Secretary of Nyasaland is goingto see and sound Dr. Banda this week and I will report orally to the Cabinet.Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1959C.

ANNEXNYASALAND EMERGENCY(Note by the Secretary of State for the Colonies)CCAs my colleagues are aware I am anxious to ensure that the Emergency in nyasaland is brought to an end as soon as possible, and that meanwhile therelease of detainees should be accelerated and the conditions of Dr. Banda&apos;sdetention relaxed. It was to enable me to explore the possibilities further that I asked the Governor of Nyasaland, Sir Robert Armitage, to meet me inDar es Salaam during my recent visit to East Africa. Our meeting took place on19th December, 1959.2. I discussed with Sir Robert Armitage the rate of release of the Nyasalanddetainees and the progress towards ending the emergency. We have agreed thatreleases can be accelerated and that the programme should be broadly as in thefollowing table:-                       Number held at Releases during month                     beginning of month the month]f, 101)January .........      * &quot; 80February .........      J  70March ...      ......      fJJ 41April .........      &quot;6 3gMay .........       ivy 38June .........       *&apos; -July ......3. It should be possible to judge by some time in March whether earlierreleases have caused serious deterioration in the security position and hence whetherthe remainder of the programme can be adhered to. On the assumption, which atthis distance it is certainly reasonable to make, that the programme will not provetoo ambitious, we should be down to a ceiling of not more than 50 detainees by theend of June. The Governor regards these as a hard core in respect of whom itwould be impossible to say when they could be released. However, I would hope to visit Nyasaland myself at about that time and it might then be possible to make some further decision about the numbers involved. Subject to this it should alsobe possible then to announce the end of the emergency, provision having previously been made on the Kenya lines for continued detention of the hard core by name.4. Subject to the view of the Cabinet I propose announcing at an early date(e.g., before the Prime Minister arrives in Nyasaland) that an acceleratedprogramme of releases has been drawn up; the statement would not, of course,give the actual figures but I should hope to demonstrate its effectiveness by quotingthe figures in Parliament from time to time.5. As far as Dr. Banda is concerned the Governor and I are agreed that hecould not be released until after the Monckton Commission had left Nyasalandalthough his case would, like others, continue tp be subject to review.6. Sir Robert Armitage has prepared a statement to the effect that detaineeswill be allowed private visits from professional or expert advisers for the solepurpose of preparing evidence for submission to the Commission. He will clearthis with his Attorney-General and the Federal Authorities on his return toNyasaland and should be able to announce it before the Prime Minister reachesthe Federation.24th December, 1959.
