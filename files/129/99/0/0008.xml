It is issued for the personal use of..        . DftKh^n^.. $ttt&amp;....................TOP SECRET Copy No.   31C. (59) 15813th November, 1959CABINETTHE BALLISTIC MISSILE EARLY WARNING system memorandum by the Minister of Defence and the Secretary of State for air the United States have developed a plan for giving early warning of ballisticmissile attacks on the United States and this country. Three exceptionallypowerful radar stations are required for the purpose, one in Greenland, one inAlaska, and one in this country. Work on the sites in Greenland andAlaska is already far advanced, and expenditure to date has totalled over$900 millions. The United States have asked that the third station in the chain,which covers the approaches to this country as well as to the; Eastern: Seaboardof the United States, should be developed as a joint Anglo-United States station.The information from the whole &quot;System would be freely available to the UnitedKingdom. Without it, the United Kingdom would have no warning of missileattack at all.2. The system when fully operational will be able to give the United Stateshalf an hour&apos;s warning of land-based ballistic missile attack. It would, give ushalf an hour&apos;s warning too if the Russians were to attempt simultaneous missileimpact on American and British deterrent bases. If the Russians fired at us first,the warning period would probably be between 5 and 15 minutes, according tothe trajectory used. On certain extreme hypotheses the warning might be slightlyshorter or slightly longer.3. The radar which it is planned to install in this country will be able to record the presence in space of up to 30 missiles per second, and give some indication of their impact points. Its arc of scan will he from 340o true to 1350true, and it will thus be able, by itself, to detect all launchings, whether of shortrange, intermediate range or inter-Continental ballistic missiles, which might befired in the whole of Soviet or Soviet-controlled territory against the UnitedKingdom, though it would not detect launchings from submarines outside the arcof scan. The station is important to the United Kingdom because the warninggiven by it of missile attack would be long enough and reliable enough to enablethe V-bomber force, or at any rate a substantial part of it, to avoid destructionon the ground by becoming airborne and out of harm&apos;s way before the omissilesarrived, provided that the force had previously been brought to readiness during a period of strategic warning. The warning would also enable BLUE STREAKin underground protection to be made ready so that it could be fired as soon asthe decision to retaliate had been taken.4. For the United States the proposed station in the United Kingdom is anessential part of their chain. Without it, their early warning system will be incapable of giving full cover to the deterrent bases in the United States.56117
5. Apart from cost, the proposal raises two practical problems for the UnitedKingdom: of siting, and of interference with other electronic devices.Siting6. It has proved most difficult to find a site for this station. An area of about  square miles is needed forthe station itself and its associated safety area. the site must meet severe topographical, geological and operational criteria.7. The only suitable site which has been discovered is at Fylingdales in north-East Yorkshire. It is Government-owned land which has been used for anArmy bombing range, but the requirement is now over. Part is owned by the WarOffice and the rest by the Forestry Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture.The surrounding area is very sparsely populated.8. A major drawback is that the site is in a conspicuous and much visited areaof the North York Moors National Park. We must expect sustained and vigorouscriticism of this choice on the grounds that it runs counter to the whole conception of National Parks. We propose that the Air Ministry, in collaboration with theMinistry of Housing and Local Government, should discuss the detailed siting and similar points (for example the possible planting of trees) with the local planning authority, the National Parks Commission and amenity bodies such as the council for the Preservation of Rural England; but these discussions will not prevent bitterprotests being made against putting this station in a National Park.9. The Minister of Housing and Local Government tells us that he acceptsthat, if this station is to be deployed in the United Kingdom, there is no practical alternative to Fylingdales if the siting criteria are to be met. But he would not like his colleagues to be under any illusion as to the volume of the criticism to whichthe selection of this site will give rise. He has suggested that it would help if theAir Ministry gave a public undertaking to remove the installations down.to groundlevel if ever the station became redundant. This would be awkward in that itwould constitute something of a precedent. The cost would be at least  0 - 5 million.We should welcome the opinion of the Cabinet on this proposal.10. If a satisfactory agreement is reached with the United States we should like approval to transfer the land to the Air Ministry from the War Office, the forestry Commission and the Ministry of Agriculture and to open discussions withthe County Authorities and other bodies concerned.Interference11. The interference is similar to that entailed in operating early-warningradars in the control and reporting chain, except that the station would be muchmore powerful. Tests are still being made by the United States to determine the precise extent of the interference, but it is already clear that there is no risk of injury to human beings or animallife outside the planned perimeter of the station. Beyondthe station boundaries, the only likely difficulty on the ground concerns interferencewith television sets. This would occur only in a small sector, which is sparsely populated. We are advised that corrective devices could be fitted at small expense.In the air there is likely to be damage to aircraft electronic equipment up to 5 miles away from the station, and up to heights of 10,000 feet. This area would haveto be prohibited to aircraft, but much of it has been prohibited already because ofthe bombing range. There is likely to be interference with some aircraftcommunications, possibly up to 20 miles in front of the station in the extreme case and up to heights of 17,000 feet. This larger area is not, however, much frequentedby1 civil aircraft, and there is no regular air route across it.Finance12. The United States attach the greatest importance to this station which ought Jo be operational by the end of 1962. Such a completion date would requireearly agreement with the United States on the division of financial and otherresponsibilities and work ought to start early in the new year. Earlier this yearMr. Sandys, when Minister of Defence, assured the Assistant Secretary of the UniteStates Department of Defence, the late Mr. Quarles, of his concurrence in principle^with the establishment of the station and asked that a specific proposal should beput forward. For this and other reasons the United States are pressing stronglyfor an early decision.
13. The United States propose to provide the equipment free and operate it for an initial period of 12 months. Thereafter, the United States contingent woulddwindle to a liaison party of about 15 men. The United States would like us topay for:  (a) Works and land, provisionally estimated to cost  7-7 millions.(b) Communications to be installed by the Post Office in the United Kingdomcosting  0-75 millions. - -   ! -      -   v,;(c) Station running costs, which may fee in the region of  0-5 million- 0-75million a year.id) Technical maintenance which may cost  1-5 millions a year.14. The United States&apos; suggestion is that technical maintenance should becarried out under civil contract, in which case the manpower commitment for theRoyal Air Force would be small probably not more than 20-30 officers and airmen. About 500 civilians would probably be needed.15. The United States propose to provide spares for the first twelve months,and suggest that subsequent responsibility for their provision should be negotiatedyear by year. They estimate the cost at about  2 millions per annum.. 16. We would propose that the Air Ministry should be authorised to acceptthe costs at 13 (a), (b) and (c) above (on the general lines of the THOR agreement)but should insist that the United States assume responsibility for providing sparesfor not less than five years of operation. We should also try to avoid acceptingresponsibility for technical maintenance costs.17.   We invite the Cabinet:  (a) To approve the establishment of a ballistic missile early warning station inthis country as a joint Anglo-United States project, subject to the negotiation of a satisfactory agreement with the United States.(b) To agree that the Air Ministry should negotiate with the United States AirForce on the lines indicated above.(c) To approve the selection of Fylingdales as a site and to indicate their viewson the point discussed in paragraph 9.H. W.G. R. W.12th November, 1959.
