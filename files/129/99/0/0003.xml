ANNEX

Convention No. 108 concerning Seafarers&apos; National Identity Documents

This Convention requires a ratifying Government:-

(a) To issue an identity document complying with the Convention to any of its own nationals who are seafarers. It also authorises the issue of similar documents to other seamen, e.g. stateless aliens.

(b) To grant certain facilities on its territory to seamen holding documents issued under it by other ratifying States.

2. As regards (a), no significant change of United Kingdom practice is entailed. The introduction of a modified identity document to replace the British Seamen&apos;s Identity Card first issued in 1942 as part of the wartime national registration system has been delayed pending international agreement on the form of the document. This is now achieved by the Convention, and it is proposed gradually to replace the Identity Card by a document conforming with the Convention&apos;s requirements. The new document will be issued by the Ministry of Transport to same classes of seafarers as are entitled to the British Seamen&apos;s Identity Card. As regards seamen who would not be entitled to the new British Seamen&apos;s Card, or to equivalent colonial documents, i.e., men who are stateless or refugees, the Home Office will continue to issue identity documents to those who are qualified as United Kingdom residents and arrangements are being made for these documents to be endorsed so as to comply with the Convention.

3. Under the Convention the United Kingdom will undertake to re-admit a seaman holding either type of document up to one year after the expiry of its validity. This conforms with existing practice.

4. Under (b) the obligation is to admit a seaman holding a Convention document for shore leave and also, provided that the document is in a form suitable for entries by the immigration authorities, for other purposes arising from his occupation, e.g., to join a ship. There is a saving to permit the exclusion or removal of any particular individual, e.g., on health or security grounds. This provision should operate to the benefit of British seamen in foreign ports. It may call for a slight modification of United Kingdom practice if and when any of the States with whom we have no visa abolition agreement ratifies the Convention, e.g., Eastern European and certain South American countries. At present seamen from such countries, if not listed in the ship&apos;s articles, require a United Kingdom visa. The Home Secretary foresees no difficulty, however, in issuing administrative instructions at the appropriate time which will secure full compliance with this obligation under the Convention.

5. No new legislation is needed for ratification, but it will be necessary to make an Order under Section 4 of the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1953 prescribing the form of the new Seamen&apos;s Identity Card.

Convention No. 109 Concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship and Manning  

6. The Convention modifies an earlier Convention (No. 93) concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship and Manning (Revised 1949) in a number of respects, the main change being to enable Governments to ratify while excluding from ratification Part II, which regulates wages. This new provision had the strong support of the United Kingdom seafarers. The United Kingdom shipowners were just as strongly opposed to it. In fact, the shipowners have stated that even if United Kingdom practice were fully in accord with the provisions of the Convention in Part III (Hours of Work) and Part IV (Manning), they would feel bound to oppose ratification of the Convention on the ground that wages, hours of work on board ship and manning should only be dealt with as an indivisible whole.
,&apos; 7^Rte.$a^^ have reported that the termsofexisting xJblieclive^agreements are in most respects substantially ahead of therequirements of the Convention but, on certain points, particularly in regard tohours, of Work and the conditions .under which overtime is payable or specialleave granted in lieu, &quot;thei agreements are at variance with the text of theConvention:8. The minimum basic pay for a calendar month of service of an able seamanis laid^o^^r^ Od. -(the prtS^Often^g^uivaleritof $&amp;)&apos;*&quot; &quot;The NJM.Eminimum fate of pay as at present  33 15s.

Able&apos;Bodied seaman&apos;sminimum . wages as, specified in the Convention would&apos;, Have &apos; to be increasedautomatically. &apos; &apos;&apos; .&apos;.        &apos;&apos;9.  It is proposed, therefore, that the Convention should not be ratified.Recommendation No. 109 concerning Wages, Hours of Work on Board Ship andManning10. The continuing failure of International Labour Conferences to agree uponthe terms of a Convention on wages, hours of work and manning which might receive widespread ratifications by maritime countries led the United KingdomGovernment delegations to recent meetings to put forward a proposal in favour of adopting a Recommendation on the subject. Though Recommendation No. 109as now adopted contains provisions which go beyond the standards in ConventionNo. 109, the more flexible nature of the instrument is such that it received almostunanimous support by the delegates to the 41st (Maritime) Session of the Conference.The N.M.B. have reported that the principles laid down in the Recommendation arevery widely applied in existing N.M.B. Agreements but certain reservations willhave. to be made in respect of the scope within which the provisions of theRecommendation are applied and of the hours of work which are required incertain classes of ship and types of sea-going employment. These may besummarised as follows:  (a) The Recommendation provides for its application to seafareis, other thanMasters, of all mechanically propelled seagoing ships engaged in tradebut excluding estuarial craft, fishing vessels, and primitive vessels.N.M.B. Agreements do not apply to such individuals as pilots, doctors,musicians, &amp;c, and only to vessels of 200 gross tons or over whose creware engaged in the United Kingdom on ordinary Ministry of Transportarticles of agreement. This excludes such seamen as Asian and west african seamen engaged abroad on other forms of articles.(b) The Recommendation stipulates that the normal hours of work at sea andin port shall be eight per day in all departments., On distant trade vessels and in the catering department of near trade vessels N.M.B. agreements have broadly similar requirements. But in near trade vessels theAgreements permit the eight-hour day to be averaged over a period and provide for additional hours of work on days of arrival and sailing.11.   Subject to these reservations, the Recommendation can be accepted.-Recommendation No. 105 concerning the Contents of Medicine Chests onBoard Ship12.. This Recommendation provides that every vessel engaged in maritimenavigation should be required to carry a medicine chest and that its contents shouldbe presbribed nationally taking into consideration a minimum list appended to theRecommendation as an Annex. The broad objectives of this Recommendation are achieved in United Kingdom law and practice though there are certain minor
differences.. For example, in the case of coasting ships and vessels trading toWestttrtf EVu^jp^&apos;&quot;ip6rtSr&apos;beaCuse &apos;6t &apos;the shorter voyages involved the scale ofmedicaments is less-than that recommended. As regards inspection, our lawprovides for a druggist&apos;s certificate designed to enable a shipowner to instruct adruggistto replenish the medicines and medical stores on board a ship in accordancewith the appropriate, scales. The completion of the certificate on the back of theform, normally before the beginning of a voyage, is accepted as an assurance thatthe medicine chest is in proper order.   - r13.  Subject to these mifior differences, the Recommendation can be accepted.Recommendation No. 106 concerning Medical Advice by Radio to Ships at Sea14. The object of this Recommendation is to make medical advice by radioavailable to ships wherever they may be and to enable full use to be made of this service by ensuring that there is provided an adequate book of reference in the formof a medical guide. In the United Kingdom by voluntary arrangements withnearby hospitals and doctors, who are provided with copies of the latest edition ofthe official medical guide and medical scales which is held by all ships, the coastradio stations of the General Post Office provide a service to ships of all nationalitiesrequiring medical advice. These stations maintain a continuous watch and theservice is available throughout the 24 hours.15.  The Recommendation is thus acceptable.Recommendation No. 107 concerning the Engagement of Seafarers for Service inVessels Registered in a Foreign Country16. This Recommendation urges States to do everything in their power to discourage seafarers within their territory from accepting employment in foreignflag vessels if the conditions of engagement, and in particular those relating torepatriation and to medical care and maintenance, are not generally equivalentto those accepted by seafarers&apos; organisations in the traditional maritime countries.In proposing an instrument on this subject, the searfarers had specifically in mind the operation of ships flying &quot; flags of convenience &quot;. Seafarers are engaged in theUnited Kingdom for service on British ships on conditions governed by legislativerequirements and by collective agreements drawn up by the N.M.B. Law and practice in these respects do not apply to foreign flag vessels since matters whollyinternal to a ship are the responsibility of the flag State. But it is our establishedpolicy to encourage our seafarers to serve only in vessels where they are assured the protection and standards applicable to British vessels. The Ministry ofTransport are considering with the industry how best to impress upon seafarers theimportance of satisfying themselves of the conditions under which they would becalled upon to serve on foreign vessels before engaging for service upon th^m.17.   The Recommendation is thus acceptable.Recommendation No. 108 concerning Social Conditions and Safety of Seafarers inRelation to Registration of Ships18. This Recommendation invites States of registry of ships to accept thefull obligations implied by registration and to exercise effective jurisdiction andcontrol for the purpose of the safety and welfare of seafarers in its ships. Inparticular, a State is invited to adopt regulations and to establish a ship inspectionservice to ensure that its ships observe internationally-accepted safety standards,to supervise the signing on and signing off of seafarers and to satisfy itself thatseafarers serve on ships on its register in accordance with the standards generally accepted by the traditional maritime countries, and to ensure that properarrangements are made for the examination of candidates for certificates ofcompetency. Current legislative requirements and existing administrative arrangements are in line with these provisions.19.  The Recommendation is thus acceptable.e. h.e. M.
