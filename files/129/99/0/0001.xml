(THIS D^CTTMEMT IS THE PR &quot;PERT Y T I-JER BRIT A TilIC MAJESTY&apos;S GHVER &quot;ME, IT)c.(59) 151 copy 7&quot;&quot;.^Jd16th September, 1959ca:.^it-et&amp;ORTICULT ORE: COVEMT GARDE KJl MARKETMemorandum by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Fo-dOn 24th July the Home Affairs Committee gave general approval to the Mi-vaster of agriculutre -re&apos;s proposals for Legislation toestablish a Cove.it Garden Market Authority to take ^ver and operateCovent Garden Market.   The Committee, however, at that meeting,and a*so at a meeting on 29th July, invited him to give furtherconsideration to the proposa: to inc ude in the t ill provisions eonferr-ing compulsory purchase powers on the Authority.2.        These powers are needed in connection with the raorganisationand possible&apos;e remova1 of the market to a new site under the plans being prepared by the London County Council for the redevelopment of thewhole of the Covent Garden area.   The Committee, however, on29th July asked whether it would not be possible to confine the e erciseof the powers to the area required for continuation of the o:.istingmarket, or at least to a limited area in win h there was some r^alprospect of the new markefs being built.3.        This possibility has been examined in consultation with theMinister of Housing and Lo -.al Government    This examination hasshown that the powers whi;h the Authority will need cotxld be madeavailab e to it by an amendment of the definition of &quot;statutory under-taker&quot; in Section 119 of the Town and Country Flanning Act, l9&apos;-7, toinclude the Covent Garden Market Authority.   If this wore Jons, theAuthority would not be invested with powers of compulsory purchaseuntil the site on which the new market is to be built (whether this is the site of the present market or another site) had been designated foroompulsory purchase by the Authority by an amend/nent to the County ofLondon Deve;opment Plan and the designation confirmed, after hearingany obje-.ti.ons, by the Minister of Housing and Lo.al Government.   Assoon as this confirmation had been given, the Authority would be able to buy the designated land   ompulsori y under the powers of Se:tion 37 ofthe 1947 Act, the authorising Minister being the Minister of Agriculture.The limitation in time whi h the Committee suggested would also beprovided for, since by Section 9 of the 1947 Act the designation maylapse if the designated land is not acquired within twelve years.-1-S EC RET
4.       &quot;We accordingly withdraw the earlier proposal that generalcompulsory purchase powers should be conferred on the covent garden Market Authority and instead ask the Cabinet to agree thatthe Authority should be designated as a &quot;statutory undertaker&quot; forthe purposes of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1947, by an appropriate amendment to thatAct.J.G.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S.W.1.16th September, 1959-2-
