190THIS DOCUMENT ISTHE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (59) 183COPY NO.9th i. december, 1959CABINETINTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for theHome BepartmentI have been considering what line should be taken by theGovernment in the debate which is likely to arise from my statement in the House of Commons on 3rd December about the circumstances in which information obtained by the Reading police by listening toa telephone conversation was disclosed in certain proceedings beforethe Disciplinary Committee of the General Medical Council.   Thereare two main issues:-(i) Ought the police to listen to telephone conversations in thisway without the authority of a warrant of the Secretary ofState?(ii)    Ought material so obtained in the course of a criminalinvestigation to be disclosed before the domestic tribunal of a professional body, which is concerned with a quite different matter?2.     On the first point, there is a clear distinction between the secret interception of a telephone communication without the knowledgof either party, which was dealt with in the report of the Committeeof Privy Counsellors under the Chairmanship of Lord Birkett(Cmnd. 203) and recuires the express warrant of the Secretary ofState, and listening to a telephone conversation on an extension withthe consent of the subscriber, which is what the police did in theReading case.   I can see no justification for legislation requiring the police to obtain a warrant of the Secretary of State beforelistening to a telephone conversation with the consent of one of theparties.   Other people certainly could not be forbidden to do so   andit is essential that the police should on occasion take the opportunityof overhearing a telephone conversation for the purposes of criminalinvestigation and of dealing with forms of blackmail.   Speed is usually the essence of the matter and the opportunity would often be lost if they had first to obtain my authority.3.      The second point is more difficult.   I have considerablesympathy with the view that information obtained by the police in thecourse of criminal investigation ought not ordinarily to be madeavailable for use in disciplinary proceedings before a professionaltribunal on a different charge - although a case may sometimes arise in which it would be to the advantage of the defendant for such
information to be disclosed to the tribunal.   As the law now stands,however, disclosure cannot always be prevented.   If a subpoenais served on the police, they may be obliged to produce the documents in question unless the Home Secretary is prepared to claim Crown privilege.   Crown privilege may be claimed only incertain limited classes of casej   and the Government has undertaken,in the statement made by the Lord Chancellor in the House of lords on 6th June, 1956, to restrict its application.   In the Reading case was advised that I should not be justified in claiming Crownprivilege.   The scope of this problem will be enlarged by the professions Supplementary to Medicine Dill which creates eight newdisciplinary bodies and enables a subpoena to be issued for the purposof proceedings before them, and it is clear that these provisions willbe strongly criticised when the Bill is discussed in Parliament.4.     After consulting the Lord Chancellor and the English and scottish Law Officers, I am disposed to think that the best course might be to seek a solution on the following lines.   The powers of professional disciplinary tribunals to issue subpoenas might belimited in two ways.   Leave to issue a subpoena, given by a Judgeor Master of the High Court,    should be a pre-requisite to the issueof a subpoena to appear before such a tribunal.   Secondly, if asubpo ena is issued, the person on whom it is served should have anopportunity to object to the court on the ground that its issue willbe contrary to public policy.    This proposal, which would apply tothe existing tribunals, as well as to those about to be set up, wouldprobably involve legislation and would require careful consideration.I should like, however, to be able to say in the forthcoming debate that the Government would be willing to consider it.   I should be glad to have the views of my colleagues.R. A. B.Home Office, S. W. 1.8th december, 1959
