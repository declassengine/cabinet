THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y*S GOVERNMENT)C. (59), IS 516th December, 1959CABINETTHE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the Minister of AviationPresent difficulties-altiesThe British aircraft industry, like the aircraft industries of allother countries, has up till now been largely dependent for its existenceupon the  Low of Government defence orders and military exports.   Thevolume of these orders has fluctuated greatly with the changes in theinternational situation.   Only a few years ago, during the Korean crisis,the Government of the day called for an urgent expansion of the aircraft industry.   But when the danger receded many of these orders were greatly reduced.   Later the Defence White Paper of 1957 announced policy decisions which foreshadowed a further sharp contraction in the futuredemand for military aircraft.2.   The result is that, whilst a number of firms has today a considerableamount of military work on hand on various types (Vulcan, Victor,Lightning, Sea Vixen, Scimitar, N. A. 39), very few have any assurance offurther orders when these are completed.   Nor can the demand for british civil aircraft for some time to come anything like make up for thedecline in earnings on defence work.   Moreover, the current civil typesare not selling as well as was hoped, and the industry*s financial positionis such that there is little likelihood of any important new types beingstarted without Government support. /Future Prospects3.   If however, the aircraft industry can be helped over its present difficulties, there are good grounds for confidence in its longer-termprospects.   World air traffic is expected to treble in volume over thenext ten years, thus creating a demand for several thousand new aircraft.Provided the right steps are taken now, there is no reason why we shouldnot secure a significant share of this expanding international market.4.   In the past, Britain has led the way in many aspects of aviation.We have at this moment on the drawing-board several new projects whichare in advance of anything of their kind elsewhere.   We have some of thecleverest and most experienced design teams in the world.   We haveinvested vast sums of public money in wind-tunnels, engine-testing plant and other research equipment.   It is, therefore, mnthinkable, at a timewhen countries like India, which have no such assets, are planning to start up aircraft production of their own, that we should contemplate thepossibility of withdrawing from the civil transport field.-1-COPY NO. ^&quot;J
Government Assistance5.   The Government will have to maintain as at present a programme o aeronautical research costing about  25 millions a year, of which 10 millions is charged to the Civil Account.   It would be unrealistic to expect the industry, in the foreseeable future, to be able to relieve theGovernment of any of this expenditure.6. Government expenditure on airframe and aero-engine development at present amounts to about  37 millions a year, of which  5 millionsis in respect of civil projects.7.   Government expenditure on production is at present running at about  200 millions a year on military aircraft.0,   Thus, annual Government expenditure on research, development and production of airframes and aero-engines at present totals about 250 millions on the military side, and  15 millions on the civil side,while receipts from exports, for all types of aircraft, are running at anannual rate of about  160 millions.   It is difficult to predict   exactly the future scale of demand on the industry, but on present informationGovernment expenditure on the military side is likely, in a few years&apos;time, to fall steeply ;  there will also be a large decline in exports.9.   In order to help the aircraft industry over the critical period which it now faces, and to put it in a position to compete successfully in theworld market, I estimate that additional Government assistance on civil aircraft and aero-engine projects will be necessary for a number of years at an average rate of about  15 millions a year, made up in the mannershown below.(a) Development and Tooling-up.   The cost of developing large modernaircraft and of tooling-up for production is now becoming so great (upto  50 millions for a Transatlantic sub-sonic airliner and well over 100 millions for a supersonic type), that even the largest firms cannot longer meet it out of their own resources.   The Government must therefore be prepared to provide assistance  to promising civil projects.Indeed, on 30th July, 1959, the Committee on Civil Aviation Policydecided that the Government should make a direct contribution to development and tooling expenditure of the V. CIO.   The Government mustnot, as hitherto, necessarily make assistance for development conditional upon there being a firm requirement from one of the Corporations, for,if development is delayed until advance orders can be obtained, themarket will often be missed.   Government support of this kind for asuitable civil programme (including a supersonic airliner) might cost theExchequer an additional  10 millions a year, over and above the currentfigure of  5 millions.(b) Production.   Our national Airways Corporations are often preparedto order British aircraft off the drawing-board.   But most overseas airlinecompanies will not commit themselves to firm orders for British aircraftuntil they can see them flying, and they then usually want quick delivery.The manufacturers, on the other hand, cannot afford to buiid &quot;on spec&quot;any appreciable number of aircraft, worth maybe  1 or  2 millionsapiece.   Therefore, in order to realise export potentialities, it may be-2-
desirable that the Government, in appropriate cases, should share withthe firms the risk of producing a limited number of aircraft ahead oforders.   Until the British aircraft industry has re-established itself in civil overseas markets, the underwriting of production in this waymay well result in some loss to the Exchequer.   But on the basis of sales experience up to date this should not amount to more than about 2 to  3 millions a year.(c) Introduction into Service.   In view of the inevitable teething troubles,many airlines are reluctant to be the first to introduce a new type of air-craft.   (The introduction of the Britannia cost the British overseas airways Corporation several million pounds, and the Select Committeeon the Nationalised Industries expressed the view that such charges falltoo heavily on the Corporations.)    To meet this difficulty, the government decided some months ago, in the case of the Handley Page Herald, theAvro 748 and the Rotodyne, to make a contribution towards the costsinvolved in the introduction of these new aircraft into service by the corporations.   If British civil aircraft are to compete with United states aircraft, which are mostly based on proven military versions, it will clearly be necessary for the Government either in this or some other way to bear a major share of the heavy initial costs involved in intro-ducing these aircraft into commercial service and thus demonstratingtheir reliability.   Government expenditure under this head might amountto about  3 millions a year.Reorganisation of Industry10.   Financial assistance from the Government is essential;   but by itself it is not enough.   It is equally essential that the industry should beradically reorganised on a more rational footing.   In fact, I have made plain to the manufacturers that, unless they put their own house in order,they must not expect the Government to ihelp them out of their present difficulties.11.    There are at present twelve airframe manufacturing firms, which arelisted below together with particulars of the numbers they employ onairframe work:-Hawker Siddeley........................30,000de Havilland............................16,000Vickers................................16,000English Electric........................15,000Bristol.................................9.000Handley Page...........................0,000Short and Harland.......................0,000Fairey.................................6,000Westlands/Saunders Roe.................6,000Blackburn..............................5,000Scottish Aviation........................3,000Hunting................................  2,00012.   In view of the size and complexity of modern aircraft and thestrength of United States (and in future no doubt Russian) competition,our manufacturers must be in a position to risk big sums of capital andmust dispose of extensive facilities.   None of the present airframe companiesis financed or equipped on the scale required.   The necessary strengthcan be achieved only by the amalgamation of several companies intosuitable groups.-3-
13.   In my opinion neither the resources available nor the orders in prospect are sufficient to justify us in supporting more than two mainairframe and two main aero-engine groups.   I have made this viewknown to the manufacturers concerned and have encouraged them to startnegotiations for amalgamation with one another.14.   I hope that one group will be based upon Ha-wker Siddeley, perhaps in association with de Havilland, and that the other will be based uponVickers and English Electric.   I would see no objection to Westlandscontinuing as an independent company specialising in helicopters.15. On the aero-engine side, two major groups already exist, namelyRolls Royce and Bristol Siddeley. I hope that the work of the remainingfirms, Napiers and de Havilland, will be absorbed in due course by oneor other of the major groups.16.   During the last few weeks, I have had numerous talks with theprincipal manufacturers.   As a result, most of the companies concerned are coming to recognise that a concentration of the industry into larger and stronger groups is desirable and inevitable.   However, some ofthese firms have famous names and long   traditons;   and the decisionto merge their indentity with others is a most serious one.  Before taking this step they are understandably anxious to know what will be theGovernment&apos;s policy towards the industry and what assistance the group of amalgamated firms can expect.   As soon as I can give them this information, I believe that the reorganisation which we desire will proceed rapidly.Recommendations17.   I accordingly invite the Cabinet:-(a) to take note of the progress made in the reorganisation of theaircraft industry, on the basis of two strong groups, one making airframesand the other aero-engines;(b) to approve in principle the policy of financial support outlined inparagraph 9 above;^c) to authorise me, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to inform the manufacturers concerned of the nature and extent of thefinancial assistance which the amalgamated groups, if formed, may expect to receive from the Government;(d) to authorise me, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned,to make a general statement of the Governments policy towards theaircraft industry.D.
