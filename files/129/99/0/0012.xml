Printed for the Cabinet.   October 1959C. (59) 162 Copy No.    5g27th October, 1959 - - - -cabinet european AIR TRAFFIC control memorandum by the Minister of aviation the Common Market countries have for some time been working on aConvention to establish an international authority to control air traffic movementsat heights above 20,000 feet. This authority is to be called &quot; euro control &quot;. Thecost of the organisation is to be shared by member countries.2. The Six have told us that they would welcome the United Kingdom as amember. On the information available, there would seem to be the following advantages in our participating:  (a) The advent of civil jet aircraft flying at high speeds across nationalboundaries makes it necessary to have some effective system ofinternational air traffic control in Europe over upper air space.ib) Participation in such an organisation offers us the chance of direct influence over air traffic control systems and might enable us to promote exportsof our electronic and other specialised equipment.(c) There are political advantages in showing the Six that we are not inprinciple opposed to joining any of their organisations.(d) Britain&apos;s participation in euro control would facilitate its extension to othercountries in the Stockholm Group.3. There are a number of questions to be studied before we could definitelydecide to join euro control. Of these the principal ones are:  (a) Military requirements and the possibility of using North Atlantic Allianceequipment need to be fully considered.ib) It is technically desirable to bring certain States which are not membersof the Alliance, particularly Switzerland and Austria, into association with the euro control project; but this raises difficulties for them and forthe North Atlantic Alliance.ic) The legal, administrative and financial problems involved require detailed examination.4. The aeronautical authorities of the Six have called a meeting in Brusselsfor 31st October, at which they hope to make progress in settling the procedures for setting up euro control. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have accepted an invitation tobe represented at this meeting, and we have let it be known that we are genuinelyinterested in co-operating with the Six in the euro control project, provided that asatisfactory organisation can be worked out and subject to reserving our positionuntil technical, legal and financial implications have been fully examined.5. I propose that our representatives at the Brussels meeting should continueto take this line, and should be authorised to participate both in the examination ofthe draft Convention and in the technical study being made by NATO.6. I invite the Cabinet to approve the policy proposed above, with which theForeign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Board ofTrade and the Secretary of State for Air are in agreement.D. S.Ministry of Aviation, W.C. 2,26th October, 1959.56015CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
