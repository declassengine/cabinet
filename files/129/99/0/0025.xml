(59) 17525th November, 1959CABINETS. E. A. T. O.  PLANNING FOR LAOSMemorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign AffairsBackgroundSouth East Asia Treaty Organisation (S. E. A. T. O. ) planning hasuntil recently consisted of a series of largely academic planning studies.One of these was a plan (MPO Plan 5) to counter Communist insurgencyin Laos.   &quot;With the Laotion crisis pressure developed in S. E. A. T. O. tomake this plan realistic and to develop it into a contingency plan forLaos.   This plan would involve the despatch of 10,000 American troops,together with the Commonwealth brigade from Malaya and othersmaller S. E. A. T. O.  contributions to give the Laotion Government a firm base by holding the major towns and thus to assist them to counter the insurgency.2.   There is now pressure in 3. E. A. T. O. to make this plan fully&quot;operational&quot;.   This is a technical expression which implies bringing the plan to a state of readiness where it could be put into effect a short notice once the political decision to act had been taken.    This decisions would, of course, rest with Governments.   The United States Secretaryof State, Mr. Herter, is personally anxious to make the plan operationalsoon.   He is supported by the Thais, to a large extent by the australians and probably by other Asian members of S. E. A. T. O.   TheNew Zealanders are not enthusiastic and the French favour suspendingplanning now that the situation, in their view, is more or less stabilised.3.   Before the plan could be made operational, a number of political decisions would have to be taken on matters such as conditions for theintroduction of a S. E. A. T. O. force into Laos, legal and financial policy for setting up and maintaining a S. E. A. T. O. force there, and,in particular, the naming of an Appointed Nation and a Force CommandeThe Appointed Nation would &quot;be responsible on the Council&apos;s behalffor the conduct of operations by the S. E. A. T. O. force,f .   But it isthought that effective authority would lie rather with the Force-1-
Commander.   There is already a measure of informal agreement at theMilitary Advihci-g&apos; level that Thailand would be the Appointed nation and that the United States would provide the Force Commander.4.   In response to our representations in Washington the United Statesmember of the 3. E. A. T. O. Council  Representatives in I;angkok hasbeen instructed for the time being to cease pressing for political decisions in respect to MPO Plan 5 to be taken.   But this is a very liveissue in Bangkok, and if we stall for too long we shall certainly be accused of dragging our feet in S. E. A. T. O. planning.   Our hesitancein this field has already caused comment.   Moreover, unless we goalong with the United States in planning for S. E. A. T. O. action in Laosin the last resort, we shall run the risk of a major collision with theUnited States and certainly forfeit our ability to persuade them to workfor a political solution of the kind we think desirable, i. e. reaffirmationby both sides of the Geneva Settlement.   On 3rd November,H. M. Ambassador at Washington was instructed that, before the UnitedKingdom can enter into operational planning, it would be necessary toestablish with the United States:-(a) That we were fully agreed that S. E. A. T. O. intervention wouldnot take place except as a purely defensive measure in the last resort to prevent Laos going Communist.(b) That the stated objective would be defensive and that it would bemade clear that we would wish to follow up the military action with action through the United Nations to put an end to north vietnamese aggression (whether direct or indirect) and tore-establish peace in Laos.(c) That we were agreed that we should consult together privatelybefore the question of intervention was presented to S, E. A. T.O.for decision.The State Department gave these assurances without difficulty.5.   The question of 3. E. A. T. O. contingency planning was also discussed with the French Foreign Minister, M. Couve de Murville, during my visit to Paris on 11th November.   I expressed concern at the idea ofnominating a Force Commander and the Appointed Nation andM. Couve de Murville was similarly worried (see paragraph 2 above).It was agreed that the matter should be discussed on a tripartite basis in Washington.Froblem6.   We must inform Washington soon whether we agree with theUnited States that the Council Representative.should be authorised totake the political decisions, in particular, the naming of an AppointedNation and Force Commander, which would have the effect of makingS. E. A. T. O. planning for Laos operational.   The United states representative on the S. E. A. T. O. Council already has this authority.-2-
Argument7.   While United States assurances at paragraph 4 above are welcome,certain difficulties in respect of making MPO Plan 5 operational still remain.8.   First, it seems inevitable that the designation of an AppointedNation and Force Commander would leak to the Press.   This would raise the temperature all round, cause serious -Russian and Chinesereactions and alienate neutral opinion.   In particular, it might make it more difficult for the Russians who probably wish the situation to becalmed down, to restrain the Chinese.   In these circumstances it wouldseem to be a mistake to allow any such political decisions to be taken atthis stage.   These considerations are not invalidated by the UnitedStates argument that by making the appointments s. E. A. T. O. would be doing no more than its enemies and critics assume to have been donealready.   I suggested to the Australian Minister for External Affairs,Mr. Casey, when I saw him on 9th November that it would be preferable for these two matters to be the subject of an informal understanding inS. E. A. t. O.  rather than a formal decision, although I would have to consult my colleagues as to whether we could go even this far.Mr. Casey seemed disposed to favour this.9.   Secondly, it is very doubtful whether 3. E. A. T. O.  security isup to operational military planning (one Asian member is known recentlyto have reported on the meeting of 8. E. A. T. O. Foreign Ministers heldin Washington in September in a way which would certainly have givenCommunist intelligence access to the information).   Continued leaksof this sort about military planning would not only risk prejudicing anyoperation in Laos, but would give enemy intelligence a good idea ofour Far Eastern defence potential.   The United States and Australiaconcede that this is a danger but believe that we must take the risk inorder to put S. E. A. T. O. in a state of readiness to act rapidly if thisbecomes necessary.   We have told the United States that we are cuitewilling to have operational planning in a group of nations in whosesecurity we have confidence.   But they are not prepared to plan on a&quot;white man&apos;s basis&quot; .   They argue that the security of the AsianS. E. A. T. O. members is no worse than that of some of our Nox-thAtlantic Treaty Organisation and Central Treaty Organisation (CENTO)allies, and they hold that planning must go forward, despite the risk, bothin S. E. A. T. O. and CENTO.   We have pointed out that CENTO has notyet undertaken operational planning, and has no situation parallel withLaos on its hands.10.   Thirdly, the terms of reference of the plan still remain unchangedfrom the days of academic planning and cover only intervention insupport of the Laotian Government to counter Communist insurgency&quot;in conditions which do not permit such action to be identified asexternal aggression&quot;.   Intervention in such circumstances would bea violation of the Geneva Settlement.   Although the United states representative on S. E. A. T. O. , Admiral Felt, has acknowledged thespecial position of the United Kingdom, in relation to the GenevaSettlement, there was strong United States opposition to our earlierefforts to get the terms of reference amended so as to stipulate at anyrate a sufficient degree of North Vietnamese intervention to amount to
indirect aggression (which would enable us to argue that north vietnamese aggression had released us from our obligations under theSettlement).   The United States feared at that time that our proposal would have a bad psychological effect on other S. E. A. T, 0. members andbe taken as a manoeuvre to evade our responsibilities.   However, now that we are agreed with the United States on the objective stated at paragraph 4(b) above it would be logical, before making the planoperational, to insist upon terms of reference with which we can agree.It would follow from this that the directive to the Force Commander shouldalso be reviewed in the light of the political objectives in which theUnited States concur.11.    Fourthly, it must be recognised that, although the United states have now assured us that they will consult us privately before the questionof intervention is raised in S. E. A. T. O. there is still a real danger thatthe Laotians, finding themselves in difficulties in dealing with theirrebellion, might appeal to S. E. A. T. O. in circumstances other thanthose in which we and the United States would be prepared to intervene.For S. E. A.T.O, then to fail to respond would have a most undesirableeffect on Laotian morale, possibly even hastening the collapse of theGovernment;  it would also adversely affect S. E. A. T. O. morale and the deterrent power of the organisation.   With these considerations in mind,there is a danger that many members of S. E. A. T. O.  would wish to accede to a Laotian appeal, even if on its own merits the appeal wereunwarranted.   The existence at that stage of an operational plan whichcould be immediately put into effect, would make the danger of an ill-timed intervention more acute.   The United States have already stronglyadvised the Laotians not to appeal to S. E. A. T. O. without firstconsulting the major powers and it appears that they have received an oral assurance that the United States will be consulted.   It is difficultto see what further steps can be taken to guard against this danger.Conclusions12.   (a)   If the United Kingdom were now to oppose operational planning,she would receive some limited support from France and possibly NewZealand, but would be opposed strongly by other members, in particular,the United States and Australia, who are determined to have ready an effective operational plan for use if and when the necessity arises.   TheUnited States would be especially annoyed now that they have given us the assurances mentioned at paragraph 4 above.   A conflict of this naturein S. E. A. T. O. would have a serious effect on the morale of theorganisation;  the United Kingdom would incur a lot of odium and wouldbe regarded as running out of her S. E. A. T. O. obligations.   We shouldalso impair our ability to influence the United States to work for apolitical solution.(b)   There are certain risks inherent in undertaking operationalplanning in S. E. A. T. G. , e.g. the effect on Russian and Chinese policyof leaks about the Appointed Nation and the Force Commander, thepossible gains to enemy intelligence due to poor security and the dangerof an ill-timed appeal which might provoke the organisation to an inter-vention with which we did not agree.   On balance, however, these considerations are outweighed by the considerations in conclusion (a)above.
TOP SECRET f 50)  (c) While, therefore, we should continue to resist the taking of formal decisions at this stage on the nominations of the Force Cammandeand Appointed Nation, we should propose to the United States thatthere should be an informal understanding among3t S. E. A. T. O.members that Thailand would be the Appointed Nation and that theUnited States would provide the Force Commander.(d) We should (i) make a further attempt to secure United Statesagreement to a revision of the terms of reference of the plan so as tomake it applicable only if aggression (direct or indirect) can be shownagainst the North Vietnamese;   and (ii) tell them that we hope they willalso agree to amend where necessary the aims and objectives of theplan in the light of the political objectives on which we are now agreed.(e) Subject to a satisfactory response from the United States tothe proposals in conclusions (c) and (d) above, we should be prepared toagree to co-operate at Council Representatives Meetings in reaching the various other decisions on political matters which would enableeffective operational planning in S. E. A. T. O. to proceed.(f) If the United States are not to be persuaded, we should seekif possible to delay the formal nominations of a Force Commander andan Appointed Nation, having regard to the dangers referred to inparagraph 8 above.Recommendation13. I recommend that a telegram should be sent to H. M. ambassador at Washington setting out the difficulties which still remain in preparingoperational plans in S. E. A. T. O. and instructing him to proceed as in conclusions (c) and (d) above.   A draft telegram is attached at the Annex.S. L.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.24th November, 1959
annex draft TELEGRAMI have consulted my Cabinet colleagues.   The assurances whichthe United States have given us make it easier for us to co-operate inoperational planning in S. E. A. T. O.    Cut there remain certain difficulties.2.   First, decisions to designate the Appointed Nation and ForceCommander are almost certain to leak to the Press.   Whatever theenemies of S. E. A. T. O. may have been speculating on their own, thisleakage would be used against us.   It would raise the temperature allround, cause serious Russian and Chinese reactions and alienateneutralist opinion.   We therefore think that it would be a mistake forany such decisions to be taken formally at this stage.    We believe,however, that this difficulty could best be overcome by having insteadan informal understanding in S. E. A. T. O. as to the Appointed Nation(Thailand) and Force Commander (United States).   Mr. Casey seemednot averse to the idea when I saw him on 9th November.   We wouldinterpret this as empowering the Force Commander to proceeddis creetly with co-ordination of national plans and contributions towardsMPO Plan 5.   But it would enable us to deny reports to the effect thatthese nominations had been made.3.   Secondly, the danger of leaks to enemy intelligence (dealt within other telegrams) cannot be lightly dismissed.   Have the Americansany further views on this?4.   Thirdly, in view of American concurrence in paragraph 2(b) ofmy telegram No. 4760 it is only logical, now that we are contemplatingoperational planning, that the objectives and terms of reference of theplan should be adjusted to fit the circumstances in which we are agreedthat an intervention might take place.   The present terms of referenceare still limited to intervention in support of the Laotian Governmentto counter Communist insurgency &quot;in conditions which do not permitsuch action to be identified as external aggression&quot;.   And the aims of theplan, as given in a military planning paper submitted to the CouncilRepresentatives, include for example particiation &quot;in offensive operations against the insurgents by the provision of assistance, such as air support, communications, psychological warfare and other specialoperations&quot;.   We trust that the State Department will now agree (i) thatthe terms of reference should in due course be amended so as to showthat the ground of intervention is &quot;armed action against the establishedGovernment by organised bands or groups subject to such a degree offoreign direction, supporter control as to amount to indirect external aggression&quot;;  (ii) that when wfe receive the revised plan its stated aims and objectives should be reconsidered in the light of the political objectives with which the Americans concur.5.   Fourthly, there remains the real danger that, as a result of anappeal to 5. E. AT. G. by the Laotians in circumstances which we wouldnot consider an intervention justified, the organisation might presa forMPO Plan 5 to be put into operation, if only to avoid the adverse effects-6-
on Laotian and S. K. A. T, O. morale which would be caused by turningdown the appeal.   I hope that the Americans will press home to theLaotians their advice not to appeal to S, E. A. T. O. without firstconsulting the major powers.   If the plan were made operational andthis became public, I should certainly have to tell Parliament that itwas for S. E. A. T. O. members and not the Laotians to decide whetherintervention was desirable and explain the circumstances in which her Majestyfs Government might be willing to intervene.6.   I am explaining to the French Government why I do not think thatwe can take a completely negative line and asking them to instruct theirAmbassador to support the compromise in paragraph 2 above.   You mayinform the Americans that, if they will meet us on this and on the pointin paragraph 4 above, we can agree to co-operate at the CouncilRepresentatives Meetings in reaching the various decisions on political matters (set out in the S. E. A. T. O. document) which would alloweffective operational planning in S. E. A. T. O. to go ahead.   You shouldalso arrange for an early tripartite meeting on the question.NOVEMBER, 1959-7-
