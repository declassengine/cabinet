THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 188 COPY NO.   N &quot;h-14th December, 1959CABINETEUROPE; SITUATION AFTER MR. DILLQN&apos;S VISITMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerMr. Dillon&apos;s visit did not result as well as we had hoped.The reports of his attitude in the Times and elsewhere were whollymisleading, and will of course have done damage in Europe.   but nevertheless, it is clear that the United States do not regard aSeven/Six agreement as necessary (politically or economically) or desirable.2.        The attitude of Mr. Ballon may be summed up as foliows;-(i)  The United States support the Six for political reasons,i. e. to see a strong and cohesive Power in Western Europe.   Theyhave always been prepared to accept disadvantages to United Statestrade in order to get this political objective.   They do not see why theexistence of the European Economic Community (E. E. C. ) should create a political split in Europe - all can work-together, they say, in theNorth Atlantic Alliance (and of course in the Organisation for european economic Co-operation(O. E. E. C.)).(ii)   The United States will press the Six with increasing strength to adopt a liberal trading policy - the more firmly established are the six, the harder the United States will feel able to press.   They would clearly welcome support from us and from the Seven.(iii) Although unenthusiastic, the United States accept the Seven.When the European Free Trade Association (E. F. T.A.) Conventioncomes before the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G. A. T. T.),they will want to satisfy themselves that it is in accordance with theinternational trade rules.(iv) The United States do not oppose in principle a Free trade agreement between the Seven and the Six, provided that is in accordancewith G. A. T. T.   But they do not positively want to see an agreement,because they see it as widening and increasing the discrimination against them and so they will not press the Six to come to agreement.   They donot believe that the Six will be prepared to negotiate anyway, until they feel stronger and assured that a wider European agreement would notfrustrate the development of the Six.(v) The United States therefore consider that the best course is to make a big effort in the coming G. A. T. T. tariff negotiations toreduce the common tariff of the Six, and they welcomed our statement that we were considering with the Seven whether we should ourselvesnegotiate with the Six in this conference.-1-
3. Thus, we are bound to accept the fact that the prospects ofany significant progress towards a Seven/Six agreement at any rateduring the next few months are dim. &apos;4.        We must first of all consider some of the consequences of this,and take stock of the position.   A great deal of work is in hand, but itmay be helpful to my colleagues if I give some preliminary ideas of the implications.5.        First, how serious is the potential economic damage to us from the Treaty of Rome?   It would be unwise to draw conclusions tooquickly, but there are three points that I would mention at once:-(i)   The position is greatly affected by what happens to the seven.   If we are able to hold the Seven together, this will limit thedanger (and provide some gains to offset our losses).   If, on the otherhand, the Seven were to fall apart, and the rest of them inevitably come within the orbit of the Six, our position would be greatly weakened.   the six take one-seventh of our exports;  the Six and Seven and peripheralstake one-quarter.(ii)   It may be that the effect of the Treaty of Rome will be tomake our problem of maintaining a satisfactory balance of paymentsduring the next decade somewhat more difficult, and correspondinglysomewhat to worsen our prospects of economic growth.   But this dependsvery much upon the policies of the Six and of the United States and ofourselves and the Commonwealth;  and I think we must await a morethorough review.   We must not forget that our economy is changing fastall the time;  it has shown itself in recent years very adaptable;- andwe should not take a defeatist view.(iii)   The worst danger is that the Six might adopt policies whichwould make other countries revert to restrictive policies, and damage the whole fabric of international trade rules, leading to a generalsituation of quotas and tariffs and preferential arrangements that wouldbe very bad for us indeed.   Generally speaking, the consolidation of western European economic power in the E. E. C. inevitably reducesour influence in the formulation of the world trading rules and puts us at risk accordingly.   It could likewise become a magnet tending to attract our industry and capital from the United Kingdom into Europe -and thus leaving us in a backwater.   There is no certainty, and notnecessarily a likelihood, that such damaging results would follow - butthe possibility is there.   These dangers, again, would be much greaterif the Seven were to fall apart.6.        The dangers are not certain.   They may become serious andthey may not.   What is certain is that we should lose the benefits thatwe had hoped to gain from the all-European free trade area.   the project was a very favourable one in our interests.7.        Secondly, is there any new kind of bridge between the Sevenand the Six?  I cannot at present see the outline of one.   The only possible tariff arrangements between the Seven and the Six, other thanthe present state of affairs, are a free trade agreement and a preferential tariff agreement.   The first is at present unacceptable to-2-
the Six (and unwelcome to the United States).   The second is contraryto the international rules, and would not be acceptable to theCommonwealth or the. United States.   We are of course considering thepossibilities, but this looks like a dead end.8.        Thirdly, how can we expect the attitudes of the Six and the seven and the United States to develop?   In my view, there will be great Tanwillingness, both among the Six and among the Seven, toaccept a deadlock with no promise of an opening.   But the essentialpoint that emerged from the talks with Mr. Dillon was the growingdesire of the United States to participate more closely in the discussions of these matters.   They no longer regard the subject of &quot;Sixes andSevens&quot; as one of European concern alone, with them on the sidelines.They feel that they need, in their weakened balance of payments position, to protect their trading interests;  they also wish to getsupport in bringing pressure on the Six.9.        It is likely that the Seven will be particularly keen on findingsome wa.y to continue the discussions;  the Germans, Benelux and theItalians likewise;  and the United States too.   It is the Commission andthe French who are the stumbling blocks.   But although most of these will want to keep the position open, to take advantage of some futurechange of circumstances, there is no plan in sight offering promise of progress.10.       Fourthly, the Commonwealth   On the whole, I would say thatthis situation would not be unwelcome to the Commonwealth, who havenot been enthusiastic about a Seven/Six agreement.   Indeed, theCommonwealth might welcome the possibility of a more positive effort by the United States, with the support of the Seven, to press more liberal policies upon the Six.11.       The conclusion that I draw from this is that we should be unwise to make any drastic reassessment of policy at this time.   Ithink we should continue to keep as an objective the idea   of a free trade agreement between the Seven and the Six, accepting that it may beunrealisable or at best that we shall make very slow progress towardsit.12.       I think we should seize upon the most positive aspect ofMr. Billon&apos;s visit, which was the indication that the United States wereprepared to take a more active and official part in co-operating with europe in O. E. E. C. to find a solution of a large number of theproblems of the West - aid to the under-developed countries, the handling of the world balance of payments situation, and the problemsof trade.   This desire to work more closely with Europe is new and encouraging.   It need not be in any way incompatible with our maintaining the closest links with the Commonwealth or continuing to work throughthe world-wide institutions of the International Monetary Fund and theInternational Bank and the G. A. T. T.13.       It would seem, therefore, that our best course would be toaccept realistically the situation about Seven/Six agreement, and seek to get the Seven and the Six and the United States and the Canadiansto work together to make O. E. E. C. an effective instrument for dealingwith this series of problems on perhaps a somewhat wider basis than has been possible hitherto.-3-
14. A Ministerial meeting of the O. E. E. C. Council has been fixed for 14th January.   The agenda will includej-(i)      The world economic situation (action to maintain worldbalance of payments stability; threatened by the weakness of the dollar).(ii)      Economic aid to the under-developed countries - to prepare the way for pressure to secure a larger effort by countrieswhich are not playing their part, notably Germany but alsothe smaller advanced countries (Mr. Dillon was pressing the desirability of this, and it is very important for our ownbalance of payments that the burden should be more widelyshared).(iii)      Relations between the Six and the Seven, leading to the settingup of a body in the framework of O. E. E. C, , representingthe Seven, the Six, the United States and Canada, in whichdiscussion can be continued and progress made against thetime when political circumstances become favourable.(I regard this as necessary to keep the Seven in reasonably good heart.)15.       We cannot say yet whether this line of approach will pointtowards a way through our difficulties.   We shall need to think muchmore about it;  and consult the Commonwealth at the appropriate stage.But I cannot see any other way of keeping the Seven together (whichmust be a main objective).   The idea of getting a closer economic co-operation within O. E. E. C. between the Seven, the Six and north america must surely be in lind with our basic political, economic andmilitary requirements, and the best way to prevent the Six from doingus both economic and political damage.16.       To sum up, in my view our objectives should be:-(i)      To consolidate the E. F. T. A.(ii) To go on trying for a wider Seven/Six agreement, while accepting that at best we shall not make progress veryfast.(iii)      To join in readily in a general move, in association with theUnited States and the Seven and the Commonwealth, in theO. E. E. C. and in the G. A. T. T. , to reduce tariffs and bring pressure upon the Six to adopt a liberal policy.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.14th December, 1959-4-CEf Eft ict
