secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet-  December 1959C. (59) 181 Copy No. 5 88th December, 1959CABINETSCOTTISH AVIATION LIMITEDMemorandum by the Minister of aviation the Defence Committee asked me, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Defence, to advise further on the choice betweenthe Pegasus aircraft (made by Scottish Aviation Limited) and the Beaver(made in Canada).2. I attach a memorandum which describes the aircraft industry in scotland in general and assesses the prospects of Scottish Aviation Limited in particular.3.   My conclusions are summarised below.(a) The Government would not be justified in placing an order for Pegasusaircraft in preference to the Beaver for four main reasons.(i) The Pegasus would be appreciably more expensive and wouldnot be available until considerably later.(ii) Nevertheless, these disadvantages should be accepted, if it wouldsignificantly increase the chances of Scottish Aviation remaining in the aircraft business. But that is not so. Scottish Aviationhave little prospect of any further aircraft orders.(iii) There is no possibility in sight of any stronger aircraft firm being prepared to take over Scottish Aviation.(iv) The rejection  of the Beaver  would probably result  in  animmediate loss of Canadian orders of considerably greater value and might possibly lead to a long-term change in Canadianmilitary purchasing policy.(b) An order for the Beaver should, therefore, be approved.  However, theCanadian Government should be asked to help us by continuing for as long as possible the contract for the repair of Canadian military aircraft by Scottish Aviation.(c) Consideration should be given to the placing of an additional order forTwin Pioneer aircraft for the Royal Air Force, so as to giveScottish Aviation a breathing space in which to explore the possibilityof switching their labour and resources over to production of someother kind.D. S.Ministry of Aviation,7th December, 1959.56234
SCOTTISH AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY AND LIGHT LIAISON aircraft for THE army memorandum by the Minister of AviationV&quot; &apos;**C CjPart I of this memorandum describes the state and prospects of the aircraft industry generally in Scotland; Part II deals with the prospects of ScottishAviation Limited, with particular reference to the choice to be made between theBeaver, an aircraft built by de Havillands in Canada, and the Pegasus, an aircraftproposed by Scottish Aviation, for adoption by the Army in the role of a lightliaison aircraft.Part I. Scottish Aircraft industry. Apart from a subsidiary of Blackburn Limited, located at Dumbarton andemploying only some 150 persons on aircraft sub-contract work as part of a morebroadly based business, and a few small electronic and equipment firms againemploying relatively few persons on aircraft work, the principal components ofthe aircraft manufacturing industry in Scotland are:  (a) Ferranti Limited in Edinburgh.(b) Rolls-Royce Limited, near Glasgow, at Hillington, East Kilbride andBlantyre.(c) Scottish Aviation Limited at Renfrew and Prestwick.Ferranti Limited3. This firm employ some 2,600 persons in Edinburgh, largely on thedevelopment and production of electronic equipment for aircraft and guided weapons. It is expected that this labour force will be at least maintained in the foreseeable future.Rolls-Royce Limited4. Rolls-Royce Limited employ some 6,500 persons at Hillington, 3,000 at East Kilbride and 500 at Blantyre mainly on the production of military aero engines. It is public knowledge that Rolls-Royce intend to close their establishment at Blantyre towards the end of 1960 and they have already begun to transfer work(and workers) to East Kilbride.5. Rolls-Royce have recently given us advance warning in the strictestconfidence that they expect their total labour force on aero engine work (30,000 inEngland and Scotland) to decline by about 4,000 by the end of 1962. The Companydo not wish any significant part of these reductions to fall on their factories in theDerby area because of the greater experience of their workpeople there, the Scottishfactories having been engaged almost entirely on the quantity production of engines for which the design has been fully established. On strict economic grounds, andin accordance with the policy which we have been advocating, that of rationalisingand strengthening, the Company&apos;s view is that the greater part of this reduction should be secured by the closure of their factory at East Kilbride.6. They realise that such a decision would present severe political and social problems for Her Majesty&apos;s Government since East Kilbride is a New Town andRolls-Royce are by far the largest employers there.7. Although this serious problem is not immediate, I expect that we shall haveto face it very soon and Rolls-Royce have already been asked for a detailed statementof their plans.It is too early yet to make any recommendation in this matter, but mycolleagues should be aware of the problem.Scottish Aviation Limited8. Scottish Aviation Limited are the only firm which actually manufacturecomplete aircraft in Scotland. They are now running out of orders. At present theyemploy some 900 persons at Renfrew, mainly on the repair of Sabre aircraft owned.
by the Canadians, and some 1,400 persons at Prestwick, until recently mainlyengaged on the production of Pioneer and Twin Pioneer aircraft. They are at presentplanning to transfer about half the Canadian repair work to Prestwick and to reduce their labour force by some 400-500 at Renfrew.9. The Company are in a parlous financial state. The Finance corporation for Industry have advanced about  3-8 millions to them; interest on this has notbeen paid recently and the Company&apos;s total debt to the Finance Corporation for industry is now over  4 millions. The Finance Corporation for Industry estimate that if the Company were to be wound up now, their net loss would be over 3 millions. Doubtless there are other creditors but this sum gives a measure ofthe amount of assistance which would be necessary if the finances of ScottishAviation were to be satisfactorily restored. The Finance Corporation for industry have made no advances to the firm since February 1959 and believe that the firmhave succeeded in staying in business by following a policy of retrenchment, byrealising some of their assets.10. Thus, though the Company&apos;s maintenance and repair work on Canadianaircraft appears to be satisfactorily organised, the aircraft manufacturing side of thebusiness has proved uneconomic, and is likely to disappear very soon unless special steps are taken to keep it in being.Part II. Light Liaison Aircraft for the Army11. It is against the above background that we must consider the choice of alight liaison aircraft for the Army. The military reasons for preferring the choice of the Beaver were set out in the memorandum by the Minister of Defence submittedto the Defence Committee as D. (59) 30; and the Defence Committee accepted that,on balance, the Beaver was preferable to the Pegasus. Incidentally, the choice ofthe Beaver would provide assembly work for about 100 men at Broughton nearChester where there is also a difficult employment problem.12. The question is, therefore, whether we should over-ride the militaryadvantages of the Beaver in favour of the interests of Scottish Aviation. In my viewwe should not. It is most improbable that the placing of an order for 36 Pegasusaircraft costing about  1^ millions in all would be sufficient to preserve theCompany in the long term as an aircraft manufacturing unit in Scotland. If suchan order were placed, there would be a serious risk that the firm would neverthelessfounder during the course of its execution, and that expensive remedial measures would be necessary to ensure that the Army received the aircraft they needed.13. We might seek to avoid this by insisting that the placing of the order should be made conditional on Scottish Aviation being taken over by other interestsin the aircraft industry with stronger financial and technical resources. It iscertainly desirable to encourage the merging of the smaller firms with larger units.If, however, it were stipulated that the Pegasus order must be carried out inScotland, the whole object of rationalisation namely to strengthen the industry by concentrating available orders in the most efficient factories and eliminatinguneconomic capacity would be frustrated at the outset. Moreover, theGovernment would have to pay a higher price to secure the Pegasus aircraft inthis way, i.e., from Scottish Aviation working as a sub-unit of one of the largergroups.14. Attempts have been made in the past (most recently in January of thisyear) to bring about a merger of Scottish Aviation with some other firm, e.g.,English Electric Aviation, or the Hawker Siddeley Group, but without success.If a purchaser of the Company&apos;s assets could be found, it would be in his interestto wait for the firm to go into liquidation rather than take over its heavy financialliabilities. The Hunting Group, whose interests range beyond the aircraft field,have recently expressed to the Secretary of State for Scotland a tentative interestin Scottish Aviation, but they have made it clear that they see little future in the pioneer and Pegasus aircraft. In fact, Mr. Boxall himself, the Deputy Chairmanof Scottish Aviation, has recently informed the Secretary of State that he realisesthe acute Canadian complications in relation to the Beaver versus Pegasus order and, much as he would like the Pegasus order, considers the maintenance workmuch more important to Scottish Aviation. Mr. Boxall seems to believe that ifScottish Aviation could sell all or some of the ten Twin Pioneers now under
construction, they would gain an invaluable breathing space during which the search for a suitable form of amalgamation could be continued. I understandthere is a possibility that the Air Ministry may have a requirement for four of theseTwin Pioneers and if this is so, I would urge that the order should be placedimmediately.15. Finally, Scottish Aviation&apos;s main bread and butter work at present isCanadian repair contracts. Their prices are already said to be high in relation tothose on offer in the south and on the Continent, and if we were to deprive the canadians of the Beaver order which they have set their hearts on getting, ScottishAviation might well lose their bread and butter work. Further, to forfeit Canadiangoodwill might well cost the aircraft industry other orders, in particular orders forthe de Havilland Gnome engine which might eventually amount to a value up to six times that of the Beaver order.16. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 11 to 15 above, I do not considerthat the Government should go to the length of choosing the Pegasus in preference to the Beaver, in the hope that this might lead to the preservation of an aircraftmanufacturing industry in Scotland. Accordingly, I recommend that the cabinet should approve an order for the Beaver forthwith.D. S.December 1959.
