CONFIDENTIAL172(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER DIJETANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59)17CCOPY NO.   $1st Lecember, 1959CABINETMARITIME SAFETY COMMITTEE OF THEINTER-GOVERNMENTAL MARITIME CONSULTATIVEORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Minister of TransportElections to the Maritime Safety CommitteeLast January the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisa-tion (I. M. C. O. ) set up the Maritime Safety Committee to deal with maritimesafety.2.      The Committee consists of fourteen members &quot;elected by the Assemblyfrom the members, Governments of those nations having an importantinterest in maritime safety, of which not less than eight shall be the largestshipowning nations, and the remainder shall be elected.....&quot;.The case against Liberia and Panama3.      The United States Government supported the election of the two chiefflags of convenience countries, Liberia and Panama.    Both have a very largeregistered tonnage, but have no organisation for ensuring the safety of theirfleets and take little practical interest in safety matters.     The qualifications for registering a ship in either country are nothing more than a formality.Therefore, the traditional maritime countries, other than the United States,think that neither could properly be regarded as among &quot;the largest ship-owning nations&quot;.    The term, &quot;shipowning nations&quot; is a special one which doesnot appear in any other maritime convention.    We considered that it meanssomething different from &quot;registered tonnage&quot;, which is the term commonlyused elsewhere.     The United Kingdom and the principal maritime countries of the world, except the United States, voted against Liberia and Panama;Russia abstained.    Liberia and Panama were not elected.4.      Liberia and Panama challenged this result.    The Assembly decidedthat the question whether the Maritime Safety Committee was constituted in accordance with the Convention should be referred to the international court of Justice for an advisory opinion.     The last day on which memoranda by the countries concerned may be put before the Court is 5th December, 1959.5.      The Attorney-General takes the view that the legal arguments insupport of the case are so weak that he recommends that a United kingdom memorandum should not be put to the International Court without the approvalof the Cabinet.     For the reasons given below, I suggest to my colleagues that it would be desirable that the United Kingdom should put in a memorandum in support of the case against the election of Liberia and Panama.
Why we should submit a memorandum to the International Court6.      The United Kingdom delegation played a leading part in securing the defeat of Liberia and Panama at the Assembly.     Failure to follow thatthrough would have a profound effect on our maritime standing with the other european countries who wholeheartedly supported us at the Assembly.    Atpresent we stand high in their regard, and they are normally prepared tofollow our lead in maritime matters.    It is important for our prestige andthat of our shipping that that position should be maintained - particularly inview of the forthcoming International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea atwhich the attainment of many of our important objectives will require their support.7.      We will do ourselves serious damage if we fail to follow up the line we took at the I. M. C. O. Assembly.     Nor would there be any correspondingadvantage for us with the Americans and those who voted with them.     Theywill merely regard it as a sign of weakness.     They  will tend to pay even lesattention to the representations we and other countries are making to themabout their own flag discrimination.8.      Furthermore,   we shall be in grave difficulty with our own shipownerand with our seafarers&apos; unions, who feel very strongly about flags of convenience.Re commendation9.      I consider it essential that we should follow up the action we took atthe I. M. C. G. Assembly by submitting a memorandum to the Court.10.      The Foreign Secretary is in agreement with these views.E. M.Ministry of Transport, W.l.1st December, 1959.CC MHl ENT1AL
