PROPOSED FURTHER LIBERALISATION OF IMPORTSReport by the Economic Steering Committee(p introductionm C3 The Economic Steering Committee met to discuss this question on the29th September, 1959, under the Chairmanship of Sir Frank Lee.2. The general background of this question is that the United Kingdom isno longer able to plead balance of payments difficulties as a justification for maintaining restrictions on imports. It is clear therefore that the United Kingdomought to be ready, in conformity with its international obligations, to move on a wide front to the abolition of as many as possible of the remaining restrictions(especially those which were discriminatory) except where very special circumstances could be advanced to justify their retention. The need to take such action (whichincidentally would be to the advantage of the economy by introducing newcompetitive forces in certain fields) is enhanced by the risk that if the UnitedKingdom continued to maintain discriminatory restrictions against a wide range of American goods, the United States Administration might find itself faced withirresistible pressures to impose restrictions on United Kingdom exports to theUnited States, especially in view of the new phenomenon of a heavy deficit on theAmerican balance of payments.3. It is recognised that special considerations continue to apply in the cavseof imports from the Sino-Soviet bloc and from Japan, and that (subject to what issaid below in the case of China) whatever recommendations were made by theCommittee about the withdrawal or relaxation of restrictions on imports from other sources would not apply to those countries.4. The position of Japan is discussed in the following paragraph. As regardsimports from China there is a special difficulty in that for historical reasons Chinahas hitherto been treated as a &quot; relaxation country &quot; (i.e., as one which shouldreceive the same treatment as a member of the Organisation for European economic co-operation (O.E.E.C.)). Obviously, however, a completely open door forChinese imports would be difficult to defend either in relation to Japan or to UnitedKingdom industry. Accordingly it has now been provisionally agreed between departments that the opportunity should be taken to transfer China for licensingpurposes to the Eastern area (in which the other members of the Sino-Soviet blocare grouped). The licensing position of most imports from China will not beaffected by the change: but certain new quotas will be necessary on goods now free of restriction amounting to about 7 per cent, of China&apos;s current exports to thiscountry.5. It is recognised that a substantial removal of the remaining restrictions on imports from the dollar area and from Europe would throw into sharp contrastthe continued maintenance of a wide measure of restrictions against Japan. Duringthe visit here of the Japanese Prime Minister, it was made clear to him that there could be no question of the United Kingdom proceeding to disinvoke Article XXXVof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) vis-a-vis Japan unless some special safeguards could be introduced for the protection of United Kingdomindustries, and it was agreed that this problem should be discussed between UnitedKingdom and Japanese officials. The Committee recommends that as a first stepthe Import Licensing Committee should be asked to review the discriminatoryrestrictions currently in force against Japanese imports and to report on those caseswhere the removal or substantial relaxation of restrictions would be likely to cause serious difficulties to United Kingdom industries. (An Under-Secretary of theBoard of Trade will be going to Tokyo for the GATT meeting at the end of thismonth and will be able to undertake preliminary discussions with Japanese officials on this subject.)(ii) recommendations. Against the general background set out in paragraphs 3 and 4, theCommittee has reviewed the list of goods upon which quantitative restrictionsare still maintained i.e., against both North America and the &quot; relaxation area &quot;-(the O.E.E.C. and other countries).
7. The outcome of the Committee&apos;s discussions is shown in the four annexesto this report. It will be convenient to summarise what is comprehended in theseannexes.Annex A8. This comprises the list of goods on which import restrictions are currently being maintained but which, in the Committee&apos;s view, should be included in anearly liberalisation programme announced in, say, the early part of November totake immediate effect.9. It is not necessary to comment in detail on the items in this list except to say that:  (a) The object has been to put as much as possible into this first list, in orderto demonstrate to the world (and especially to the United States and canada) our intention to move as rapidly as possible with the dismantling of the remaining restrictions in this field.(b) Hitherto restrictions have applied to most items of equipment bought bythe United Kingdom oil companies for use either here or abroad. Theactual reference in Annex A (and the estimate of cost) relates only tothe import of those goods into the United Kingdom. But it will ofcourse be a corollary of the freeing of such imports from restrictionthat control will no longer be exercised by the Ministry of Power onthe purchase by the oil companies of such goods for use overseas.The assumed net cost of freeing such purchases from control will be 10 millions in the first year; this may be increased in subsequent years when the oil companies have fully adjusted their purchasingprogrammes.; (c) Some of the items included in the list may provoke criticism from UnitedKingdom industrial and other circles. For instance, it is proposed toliberalise the import of motor cars, notwithstanding the fact that quota restrictions are still maintained against United Kingdom cars in Franceand Italy (though the French quotas have recently been substantially increased). The inclusion in the list of such items as optical instruments and cutlery will be criticised on the grounds that the United Kingdomindustries concerned will be subjected to damaging competition fromGermany. Again the inclusion of cheap books and comic supplementsto newspapers may be criticised in some quarters on &quot; social &quot; grounds.Annex B10. This is a list of items which, for various reasons, the Committee did notthink could be included in the first long list of relaxations, but where an earlyremoval of restrictions is recognised as inevitable and right. There are, however,circumstances in each of these cases which would make it desirable to deferliberalisation for a relatively short period (not more than three or four months atthe outside) in order to give time for adjustments, consultations with overseas governments and the like.11. In many respects it would be desirable to have only one liberalisationprogramme and not two bites at the cherry for there may be the risk that the interests concerned with items which are not included in the first long list will assume thatthere can be an indefinite postponement of liberalisation in respect of those items,while on the other hand it may be thought by e.g., critics in North America thatwe are staking a claim for an unjustifiably long list of &quot; hard core &quot; items. Butthe Committee was convinced that in the interests of avoiding the delays whichconsultations would involve it would be necessary to think in terms of a two-tierexercise rather than putting everything into one immediate liberalisation programme.Hence the appearance of, and the justification for, Annex B.Annex C12. This consists of a list of those items which are still under dispute between departments. Some members of the Committee feel that there is no adequatejustification for regarding these items as belonging to: the &quot; hard core &quot;-i.e., the residual list of goods where we can see no early prospect of liberalisation.  Others55995
feel that there are special circumstances in respect of these items which, withoutnecessarily justifying their inclusion in the &quot; hard core &quot; list (Annex D), make itimpossible to contemplate their liberalisation within the period (&quot; not more than three or four months at, the outside .&quot;) envisaged for the goods listed in Annex Aand Annex B.   &apos;&quot;: &apos; &quot; &apos;&apos;&quot;Annex D13. This consists of the agreed &quot; hard core &quot; items-z.e., those which, by common agreement, cannot be included ill an immediate liberalisation programmeor in one taking effect in, say, the early months of next year. ,14. These do riot fall into&apos; one clear and convenient category. There arecertain cases where we can be certain of being able to proceed to completeliberalisation within a relatively short period of time, though perhaps not at thesame time as the second tranche of the liberalisation programme envisaged in annex B. Examples in this field are dyes and dyestuffs, and possibly tobacco and tobacco manufactures. These items have been included under a separate sub-head (i) of Annex D.15. Other items, however, are more intractable. These constitute the true&quot; hard core &quot;, where there appears to be no early prospect of liberalisation at all.These are shown under sub-head (ii) of Annex D. In respect of these items weshall have to seek the tolerance and understanding of our fellow members of the gatt, justifying them wherever possible by an appeal to the special circumstances which apply to them, or perhaps by a straight tu quoque argument.16. In general, it will be noted that liberalisation raises a special West Indianproblem, since a number of industries which give employment and relieve povertythere have grown up under the protection of quantitative restrictions for which theovert justification has been balance of payments reasons. As indicated above,the products involved are fresh grapefruit, canned grapefruit, grapefruit and orangejuice, bananas, rum and cigars.October, 1959.

It is intended to represent the assumed cost of net additional imports over a twelve-month period but little reliance can beplaced on the figures.   All previous experience shows that such figures tend to be over-estimated.Annex BITEMS PROPOSED FOR LIBERALISATION IN THE early part OF 19601. transistors*The Ministry of Supply recognise that liberalisation is inevitable sooner or later, but the United Kingdom industry making transistors is a new. one which hasbeen deliberately fostered in recent years. Therefore the more breathing spacethat it can be given the better. If there is to be a second tranche of liberalisationtransistors should be included in such a tranche rather than put in Annex A.Estimated cost:  1 million.2. Synthetic Rubber&quot;This is already being licensed freely from North America so that liberalisationshould not involve the importation of any increased quantities or additional cost.The sole question is whether from the standpoint of our political relations withMalaya, imports should be freed from restriction; at once or left until a secondRestrictions apply to the dollar area only.SECRET
tranche. On the one hand there is the consideration that the Canadians havespecifically asked for this item to be freed from restrictions, that Malaya hasrecently abolished its discriminatory restrictions on dollar imports, and that thediscussions about the disposal arrangements in respect of the United States and theUnited Kingdom rubber stockpiles look like being successfully completed. Onthe other hand there is the argument that the Government of Malaya ought ifpossible to be given more time in which to absorb the shock of an announcement about formal liberalisation.On balance it is thought that if there is to be a second tranche of liberalisationit would be best to include synthetic rubber in that exercise rather than in Annex A.Estimated cost: Nil.3. Rum and Other Alcoholic Beverages*In practice this means rum only. It is recognised that it would be difficultto defend any prolonged postponement of the liberalisation of rum and otheralcoholic beverages, but the Colonial Office feel that it will be desirable for themto clear the way for this by communications with the Colonial Governmentsconcerned. In view of the time that this may take it is thought that this itemshould be included in the second tranche. The quota for Cuban rum is not fullytaken up, so that the total cost of liberalisation can be expected to be nil at thepresent time.4. Fresh and Frozen Fish, other than Salmon*In practice this means halibut from British Columbia and perhaps cod from newfoundland. The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (M.A.F.F.) aretaking steps to ascertain what quantities could be expected in the winter months ifliberalisation took place in, say, November rather than in the early part of 1960.But on the assumption that there would be some imports, the argument is that itwould be undesirable on broad political grounds to face the United Kingdomfishing industry with the prospect of additional imports from Canada at a timewhen that industry may have to acquiesce in a tariff concession on, e.g., frozenfish fillets made to our prospective partners in the European Free Trade Association(E.F.T.A.). For this reason it is thought that liberalisation of this item should be deferred until the early part of 1960 unless the timing of the first tranche of liberalisation was such that the political difficulty anticipated by the M.A.F.F.would not arise. Estimated Cost:  1 million.5. Canned Fruit (other than Grapefruit and Apples)*This is put in a delayed category simply because of the necessity to consult theCommonwealth Governments concerned (especially Australia and South Africa)before we introduce liberalisation and of their particular interest in canned fruitexports to the United Kingdom market. Given the fact that we shall have a numberof delicate and difficult matters to raise with those Governments in the near future in connexion with the proposals for E.F.T.A., it would be desirable to give themample notice of our intentions rather than to lay ourselves open to any charge ofrushing matters unduly. Estimated cost:  2 millions.Annex CDISPUTED items. Large Aircraft^Civil aircraft may be freely imported from the &quot; Relaxation &quot; countries butonly aircraft weighing up to 4,500 lb. may be freely imported from the dollar area.There is an import duty of 17j per cent, ad valorem which has been bound in the gatt to the United States.Against eany liberalisation it is argued that the United Kingdom aircraft industry is at present in a state of crisis largely owing to a sharp reduction in defence orders from tfte Government. To maintain their very existence in thecivil field manufacturers of large aircraft must export in quantity because the home market is still too small to bear the costs of development and production.  But,
with minor exceptions, exports are only possible of types which have been sold toand proved by domestic users. As British air transport is at present organised,the production of any important British civil aircraft is dependent upon purchase by one of the two national airways corporations, over whose choice of aircraft theGovernment have at present no approved means of control other than the licensing of importation of American aircraft. United States aircraft manufacturers havecompetitive advantages, deriving from their large domestic market and the size and scope of governmental assistance; their aircraft, therefore, must hold greatattractions in some cases for a British corporation. If import restrictions were removed and no other form of control over the corporations were put in its place,the future of the aircraft industry would rest upon the commercial judgment ofthe corporations, which are under a public duty to act commercially; the industry,which is essential to defence and in which Her Majesty&apos;s Government has sunkvery large sums, would thereby be imperilled. In any event the principles of liberaltrade embodied in the GATT cannot reasonably be regarded as applicable in thecase of aircraft whose manufacture in all cases is based on Government intervention in one form or another. Although the restrictions are imposed only against the dollar area they are discriminatory only in a very limited sense in that the UnitedStates is the only significant producer of &quot; large aircraft &quot;, except at the smaller and less important end of the scale. To remove the formal restrictions on imports and to use powers to direct the national corporations to buy British would notremove what might be claimed to be a breach of our international obligations under GATT. It would also appear to bring United Kingdom policy into line with the American policy on the import of heavy electrical machinery to which her Majesty&apos;s Government object.Restrictions on the import of American aircraft at present play a key part inGovernment policy towards the aircraft industry. Any modification of therestrictions require to be considered as part of Government policy towards theindustry, not as a by-product of policy towards GATT. Throughout the periodof restriction the United Kingdom has continued to purchase United states aircraft in large quantity. Against this background there can be little likelihood of the Americans making a major issue of the continuation of restrictions beforethe Government have had time to adopt a comprehensive policy towards aviation and the aircraft industry.On the other hand, it is argued that the maintenance of these restrictions forprotective purposes would be a clear breach of our international obligations. Thecase for the maintenance of restrictions here is much the same as, for example, theUnited States manufacturers&apos; present case for restrictions on imports of heavyelectrical machinery. The United States Administration would not accept our case any more than we should be prepared to accept similar cases in the United States and they would regard it with greater seriousness because they had paid for a tariff concession on these aircraft. There would thus be a serious risk of corresponding action against our dollar exports if we maintained protectiverestrictions on aircraft our motor-car exports (over  60 millions a year) would be particularly vulnerable. In any event it should be possible, even if the formalrestrictions on imports are removed, for Her Majesty&apos;s Government to be in aposition to persuade or to direct the national corporations to buy British; it is veryquestionable how far, even with import control, we could refuse to licence importsfrom the United States for the national corporations when they could demonstrate that H was to their commercial advantage to buy them. We have in the past alwaysallowed the corporations to buy United States aircraft where they could show suchadvantages.2. Bananas*Imports are at present restricted from the Dollar but not the Relaxation area.The United Kingdom trebled the tariff, and thus the preference, for the benefit ofthe West Indies in 1956, by invoking the so-called colonial waiver in the GATT.The tariff is now 7s. 6d. per ewt. (about 14 per cent, ad valorem). There is a pricesupport scheme for bananas, operated by the West Indian Government withguarantees from the United Kingdom Treasury, which guarantees a. minimumreturn to producers, but this is running out, and its continuance is due for discussionwith the West Indies early next year.
It is suggested that liberalisation might sharply increase competition and leadto a reduction of 35 percent, to 40 per cent, in banana prices in the United kingdom market. This would involve large payments to producers from the price supportfund.On the other hand it is argued that predictions of price changes must be treated with great caution because the international banana trade is in the hands of a.fewlarge concerns. Furthermore the retention of restrictions would be internationallyindefensible in this case. The West Indian producers enjoy a price stabilisationscheme as well as a substantial tariff preference. The increase in the latter was justified to the GATT by the need to provide adequate protection for West Indianproducers, and on the implied (though admittedly not overt) understanding that ifthe preference increases were accepted, the quantitative restriction would be withdrawn as soon as the balance of payments position permitted.3. Pigmeat (uncanned)*The present position is that the Canadian Government were recently offered a quota of 10,000 tons of pigmeat for a 12-month period as an alternative to their request for complete liberalisation. The Canadian Government have howeverrepeated their request for full liberalisation. We know unofficially that the offer of a quota was badly received in Ottawa both on grounds of principle and because it involved worse treatment for Canada than for Western European countries likeHolland or even Poland.The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (M.A.F.F.) take the viewthat complete liberalisation at an early date would give rise to acute difficulties with United Kingdom producers and bacon curers especially if it came shortly after the announcement of the impending tariff concession on bacon to Denmark.Moreover there would be a risk that very substantial quantities of pigmeat heldin stock by the Canadian Government might be thrown on to the United kingdom market. This would not only involve additional cost to the Exchequer but wouldexacerbate the political difficulties of the. situation.It has been urged on the other hand that our position vis-a-vis the canadian government would become an indefensible one if we continued to maintain severequota restrictions on Canadian pigmeat and that it would be possible to cometo an arrangement with the Canadian Government under which, while UnitedKingdom pigmeat imports were freed from restriction, some voluntary limitationwere placed by the Canadian Government on the rate of disposal of their stockson to the United Kingdom market.The M.A.F.F. have undertaken to consider further the practicability of anarrangement on the foregoing lines (which would, of course, involve free import ofpigmeat from private suppliers in both Canada and the United States) but subjectto that review they think that the quota of 10,000 tons should be maintained forthe present, though they would be prepared for the size of the quota to be reviewedafter it had been in operation for, say, six months.4. Flower BulbsThe position on this item is that the Dutch Government has been pressing us for some considerable time to proceed to complete liberalisation. There has alsobeen somewhat embarrassing pressure from domestic user interests in this country.On the other hand the question of establishing suitable tariff protection as analternative to the quota involves serious difficulties. In these circumstances theline which the Government have taken is that the National Farmers&apos; Unions(N.F.U.&apos;s) should work out with the Dutch exporting interests a suitable minimum price scheme. An agreement about such a scheme was entered into by the N.F.U.&apos;sin 1955 but was never put into operation. Recently the N.F.U.&apos;s have come tohave doubts about the efficacy from their standpoint of schemes on these lines.They were recently advised by the Board of Trade to go back to the Dutch inorder to explore whether any more satisfactory arrangements could be agreed.The N.F.U.S are being asked to let us know the outcome of these enquiries.Pending their answer it is difficult to take a firm decision about liberalisation. TheBoard of Trade and Treasury view is that if bulbs cannot be included in the firsttranche of liberalisation they should definitely find a place in the second list* Restrictions apply to the dollar area only.SECRET
(/. ., of items to be freed in the early part of 1960) and that the Dutch Governmentshould be informed to this effect when the first liberalisation measures areannounced.  The M.A.F.F. reserve their position on these two latter points.5. Grasses and Clover Seeds       - &apos;      &apos;This item is still to be discussed further at official level between the M.A.F.F.and the Board of Trade. 1 ;&apos;&quot; &apos;The M.A.F.F. position is that legislation to continue the presentnon-discriminatory controls oVer imports of seeds unsuitable for United Kingdomconditions was unlikely to be challenged, and could if necessary be defended underGATT as a measure &quot;necessary to protect plant life or health &quot;. The UnitedStates, Canada, and Western Germany all exercise more stringent controls overseed imports. A recommendation for such legislation was included in a reporton seeds legislation (Cmd. 300) and will be considered soon by Ministers in. thatcontext. The Board of Trade consider that, from the standpoint of our international obligations, the maintenance of controls on the imports of such seeds could only bejustified if there were some control also over domestic seed which, in the opinionof M.A.F.F., is unnecessary.6. Milk ProductsThe problem has been that unrestricted imports of condensed milk mightundermine the existing price structure of the Milk Marketing Board. It now seems possible, however, that the Dutch and Danish exporting interests may be preparedto reach agreement about prices with the Milk Marketing Board. This would not,however, necessarily mean that complete liberalisation could be contemplated by the M.A.F.F. since there would be the risk of substantial imports of processedmilk from stocks held by the United States Government. But it was difficult tojustify a position in which imports of milk products from the sterling area wereadmitted without restriction, imports from Europe were controlled but at presentfreely licensed, while there was a complete prohibition on imports from dollar sources. It was agreed that it would be necessary to wait to see whether somesatisfactory agreement was achieved with Danish and Dutch exporting interests.If that were so then the M.A.F.F. would consider whether it would be possible toproceed to complete liberalisation. In any event, however, they would considermeasures to remove discrimination as between the dollar area and Europeansources of supply.7. Pharmaceuticals*Liberalisation would mean making available for prescription under the health service, American-produced pharmaceuticals whose prices are higher than thoseprevailing in this country. It is present Government policy that doctors havefreedom to prescribe under the Health Service the medicines they consider necessaryfor their patients and the American drug industry might be expected by powerfulsales promotion pressure and elaborate therapeutic claims to induce many of themto prescribe their preparations. The resulting extra cost would fall almost whollyupon the Exchequer and might add several million pounds (not likely to exceed 10 millions) a year to the present annual drugs bill of some  80 millions a year.The Ministry of Health is at present considering ways and means of restrainingthe growing drug bill and one proposal is to negotiate with the industry with a viewto tightening up the existing voluntary price regulation scheme, now governing theprices of most proprietary preparations in this country and which expires in June1960. The Ministry of Health fear that liberalisation of dollar imports would jeopardise; to the detriment of the Exchequer their prospects of negotiating; a bettervoluntary regulation scheme and would prefer to postpone liberalisation until July1960 when the scheme will have been negotiated;The new agreement would in any event have to. include a clause permittingeither side to ask for a further review in the event of any major change. Thiswould be an answer to any criticism that, the agreement ought not to have been concluded without disclosing the intention to liberalise; dollar imports. It is theMinistry of Health&apos;s view that there is much less risk that the industry (who have* Restrictions apply to the dollar area only.SECRET55995 c
Annex DAGREED  ITEMS OF SPECIAL DIFFICULTY(a) Short Term1, Dyes and DyestuffsThese can be removed from quantitative restriction control as soon as it ispossible to introduce a tariff in replacement. The timing of this depends upon thedate from which it is known for certain that the European Free Trade Associationwill be established. This means that, if all goes well, the tariff should be introduced and import restrictions withdrawn in January 1960.2. Tobacco and Tobacco Manufactures*^ This essentially turns on our being able to persuade the Government of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland to accept liberalisation of tobacco withoutprotest. This will obviously take time on one view it might not be possible tointroduce liberalisation until the discussions about the future of the Federationhave been completed, in at least 12 months from now. The Federation Governmentrecently asked the Board of Trade at the official level Whether any long-termsafeguards could be given about the position of Rhodesian tobacco in the UnitedKingdom market. The view of the Board of Trade is that liberalisation would infact make little difference to the market prospects for Rhodesian tobacco and thatthe only safeguard consonant with our general obligations would be some formof &quot; best endeavours &quot; undertaking from United Kingdom manufacturers.It would be difficult to liberalise tobacco manufactures (including cigars) inadvance of tobacco, but it is contemplated that the position could be held by giving a substantial increase in the present token quota for dollar cigarettes and pipetobacco.3. Fresh Grapefruit*The proposal here is to recur to the suggestion originally made in 1956 wherebywe would seek to secure GATT approval (under the so-called Colonial waiver)for an increase in the present most favoured nation tariff, so as to be able to remove the quantitative restrictions in imports. The Colonial Office are anxious that evenif an increased tariff is introduced, the quantitative restrictions should be retained for a period of at least 2\ years. As against this view it seems clear that thenecessary authority could not be obtained in the GATT (especially in view of the major interest of the United States) unless we undertook to remove the quantitative restrictions simultaneously with the introduction of the higher tariff.(b) Long TermWatchesJute goodsCoal and cokeBaskets* Canned grapefruit*Grapefruit and orange juiceApples and pears, including canned applesPotatoes other than newWhole hamsSECRET: known informally for some time that liberalisation at some stage was a possibility)would wish to depart from an agreement already concluded than that they wouldadopt a less co-operative attitude in the negotiations for a new agreement ifliberalisation took place meanwhile.The Board of Trade and the Treasury think it will be necessary to explain tothe United States and Canada why we need to continue to use discriminatoryrestriction of imports of pharmaceuticals until as late as July 1960 and do not see what arguments could be produced which the Americans and Canadians would regard as at all reasonable.
These are agreed to be the residual cases of particular difficulty in which no possibility is seen of our being able to proceed to liberalisation within, say, ithenext 12-18 months. That being so, it is not thought necessary to discuss them indetail. In the case of two items (canned grapefruit and grapefruit and orange juice)it is hoped to hold discussions with the United States Administration which maylead towards agreed solutions and the maintenance of quantitative restrictions inthe meantime. In another case (baskets) it is agreed that liberalisation should bepossible within a three year period. In the case of watches a special agreement hasrecently been arrived at between the Swiss and United Kingdom industries whichenvisages a steady increase of import quotas in the United Kingdom markets overthe next five years, by which time it is anticipated that the level of imports will be close to what they would be if there were complete liberalisation. On the other items, however, we can at present see no end to the tunnel.
