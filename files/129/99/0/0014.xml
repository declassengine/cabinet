Printed for the Cabinet. November 1959C. (59) 164 Copy No.   5 53rd November, 1959CABINETPENSIONS OF THE HIGHER judiciary memorandum by the Lord chancellor on 28th July, 1959, the Cabinet authorised me to arrange for legislation to beprepared on the basis outlined in C. (59) 135 on the understanding that the cabinet would be given a further opportunity to consider the substance of the proposals before legislation was introduced (C.C. (59) 47th Conclusions, Minute 1). A bill has now been drafted and I think it is most desirable that it should be introducedimmediately. The announcement of the Governments intentions which I made inthe House of Lords on 2nd July has led the Judges to expect legislation on thissubject at an early date. Some Judges are ill and ought, and want, to retire as soonas possible. Some of the older Judges are also holding back their resignations untilthe Bill is passed. For these reasons alone I am satisfied that early legislation is inthe public interest.2. The details of the proposals for a new scale of pensions coupled with a compulsory retiring age are fully set out in C. (59) 135. With the authority of theCabinet I have discussed them with the senior Judges in England (the Lord chief justice, the Master of the Rolls and Lord Merriman), with the Lord Chief justice of Northern Ireland and (with the concurrence of the Secretary of State forScotland) with Lord Clyde. In general our proposals were warmly welcomed by the judiciary. They had some doubts about the introduction of the scheme of graduated pensions which is proposed for Judges appointed in the future, but the Chancellorof the Exchequer and I are satisfied that this feature of our proposals is right inprinciple and will be acceptable to Parliament. All I need add here is that I thinkthat the increase of 12 per cent, in existing pensions proposed in paragraph 6 ofC. (59) 135 should apply to all Judges who have already retired. The fact that therehas been no increase in the Judges&apos; pensions for well over a hundred years is amplejustification for this course. The latest retirement from the High Court Bench tookplace on 6th April this year, and I am satisfied that we cannot justify any difference in treatment of Judges who retire after a given date, as is the practice in the case ofPensions (Increase) Acts. Such a course would be unfair not only to the Judgesthemselves but also to their widows, whose pensions are fixed by reference to those to which their husbands were entitled.K.House of Lords, S.W. 1,2nd November, 1959.56065THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT
