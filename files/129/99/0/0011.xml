77Printed for the Cabinet.  October 1959C. (59) 161 Copy No.    5523rd October, 1959CABINETSUEZ CANAL COMPENSATION: INCOME TAX LIABILITYMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 18th September the Cabinet discussed the liability of shareholders of the suez Canal Company to United Kingdom income tax on payments received by wayof compensation, and invited me to consider in consultation with the Attorney-General whether this case might be distinguished from the case of commissioners of Inland Revenue v. Reids Trustees (C.C. (59) 52nd Conclusions, Minute 1).2. I have now been able to consult the Attorney-General, whose advice isthat he could not support the view that since part of the compensation took theform of shares, the case was distinguishable from that of Reids Trustees. he therefore agrees with the view which I put forward in my memorandum of14th September (C. (59) 149) that those Suez shareholders who received shares inthe subsidiary company as part of their distribution are assessable to tax on thevalue of the shares they received.3. I am still convinced that it would not be right in this case to proceed byway of extra-statutory concession or of special legislation. I therefore invite mycolleagues to agree that I should now inform the Chairman of the Stock Exchangethat I cannot intervene.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,23rd October, 1959.55994THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;5 GOVERNMENT
