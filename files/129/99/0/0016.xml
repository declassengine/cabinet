(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 1669th November, 1959CABINETUNITED NATIONS; FRENCH NUCLEAR TESTSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe position at the United Nations at the time of writing this paper is as fallows:-(a) Eighteen Afro-Asian countries have tabled a resolution in extreme terms which requests the French to refrain from carryingout their tests on the grounds of the &quot;grave dangers and risks to which such nuclear tests would expose the populations of many countriesin Africa and elsewhere&quot;,   (text at Annex A to this paper).       the afro-Asians have been pressing for this resolution to be put to the vote as soon as possible and there have been no signs that its termsare likely to be weakened.(b) The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs has so far onlyintervened in the debate to speak on the limited question of whetherthe French tests are likely to cause damage to health in other countries.(The Moroccan representative in opening the debate had statedspecifically that Morocco saw no objection to the entry of France intothe field of atomic weapons and that their objection was confined tothe specific cuestion of the affect of atomic tests in the Sahara itself and in the surrounding countries.)    Mr. Ormsby-Gore hoped by his speech to minimise the effect on Africans of the scaremongeringstatements  made by other participants in the debate.   He specificallyreserved his right to speak later on the wider aspects.   I havesuggested to him that there is something to be said for letting ourresolution as far as possible speak for itself.(c) Instructions have been sent to the United Kingdom delegation to table an alternative resolution on the lines of the draft at Annex Bto this paper unless there has been some new development in theFrench position.   We do not yet know whether CO/-sponsors can befound.   The Delegation have reported that the Latin Americans havealso been considering the possibility of tabling an alternativeresolution but it seems unlikely that they will proceed with this.(d) Voting will almost certainly take place tomorrow, Tuesday,10th November.-1-COPY NO.
(e) The Delegation have reported that there is no hope ofsecuring priority for our draft or of avoiding a vote on the Afro-Asian draft.   It is of course possible that if the Afro-Asian draftfails to secure the necessary two-thirds majority the Afro-Asianswill table amendments to our draft, but it is impossible to forecastwhat form  these would take.(f) Mr. Herter (United States Secretary of State) has said thatthe United States Delegation will vote against the Afro-Asian draftresooution in its present extreme and discriminatory form.His main fear has been that it would be watered down sufficiently to make it awkward for the United States to oppose it.   The UnitedStates Delegation are  authorised to vote for our draft resolution.(g) The position of the other delegations on the Afro-Asian draft is not known precisely but seems likely to be the following:  themajority of countries in the North Atlantic Alliance are likely to vote against it, but Canada and Norway are likely to abstain;Australia is also likely to abstain as are the majority of the LatinAmeri cans;   most of the Afro;Asian countries, and presumably theSoviet bloc, will vote for it.(h) M. Moch, the French delegate on the  disarmament commission,   told the Minister of State with great emphasis some dayago that failure by the United Kingdom to vote against the presentAfro-Asian draft would be catastrophic for Anglo-French relations and in particular for our relations with General de Gaulle, thePresident of the French Republic.,U $commendation,2.     In these circumstances I am inclined to think that the delegation should be authorised to vote against the Afro-Asian draft resolution if it comes to the vote in its present form, unless - as is most unlikely - the French should previouslyinformus that tbeywould be content for their friends to abstain on it.   We could explainthis vote by pointing out that the draft was based on the assumption -which we consider to be false - that the proposed French test wotddsubject the population of neighbouring countries to grave dangers, andemphasise that in our view the important thing   is not to get thisparticular test stopped but to get all nuclear teats stopped by aninternational agreement containing effective controls.   Cur draftpoints the way to doing this while the Afro-Asian draft is purelycondemnatory.S.L.Foreign Office, S.W.1.9th November, 1959
