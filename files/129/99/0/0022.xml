(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C. (59) 172COPY NO.\24th November, 1959CABINETPICCADILLY CIRCUS: MONICO SITEMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and Minister for Welsh affairs in view of public disruiet, partly based on a rather misleadingpicture published in the Press, I decided that a public enquiry was essential on the application to put up a new building, designed partly as offices, shops and restaurant and partly to display illuminatedadvertisements, on a site on the northern side of Piccadilly Circus.I have accordingly called the application in for decision by myself.A decision will now have to await the outcome of the enruiry.Meanwhile, in view of the concern which has been expressed inParliament and in the Press, I think the Cabinet will like to know the background facts.2.   The London County Council (L. C. C. ), which as a planning authority is one of the best and most co-operative in the country, havebeen struggling for a long time to settle re-development proposalsround the Circus.   They do not own the land.   Therefore they are dependent on private developers for the style of building to go up, andfor the order in which proposals come forward.   They prepared amodel last year to give an indication of their ideas for the Circus.This ran into difficulties;   in particular it suggested a raised pedestrianway, which none of the private interests concerned were prepared toaccept.3.   However, the Council thought that they could without further delaysettle the re-development of the Monico site, whose owners were most anxious to get ahead.   The owners were prepared, without claimingcompensation, to straighten out the corner of Glasshouse Street andShaftesbury Avenue, a valuable improvement which should fit into any scheme for the Circus.   So the Council got down to discussing with theowners the kind of building which as planning authority they would beprepared to allow.4.   The main problem arose over the advertisement display.   It hashitherto been generally accepted (though clearly some of the criticsnow want to call it in cuestion) that bright advertisement lights must continue to be a striking feature of the Circus;   my view is that thepublic would be most indignant if any public authority tried to get rid of them.   But the crux of the matter is that you cannot satisfactorilycombine office windows with large-scale advertising;  it is not generallyrealised that many of the rooms behind the present electric signs in the
CONFIDENTIAL *1 J DCircus are empty.   Hence the developerls proposal for a blank verticalstrip of wall above the ground floor to carry the signs.   That is thefeature which has aroused most of the protest;  and the protest wasexacerbated by the fact that a published sketch of the building (not previously disclosed to the L. C. C. ) showed extremely crude advertisingand a very ugly crane on top.5.   In fact, the public has not yet seen the design as it is now proposed^The L.. C. C. have, after consulting the Royal Fine Art Commission,insisted on improvements to meet one of the Commissions criticisms,though they have felt that they must accept the blank wall to carry theilluminated signs, which was the other thing the Commission did not like.   It is by no means clear what the alternative is, if illuminated,advertisements are to remain a feature of the Circus.6.   It was against this background that I was at first unwilling tocall the case in.   The owners have spent a great deal in acquiring the site, and on the strength of assurances given by the L. C. C. that, ifthey would effect certain improvements, planning permission would be forthcoming, they have already entered into contracts for the work to begin.   (The L. C. C. have not, as many people imagine, actually givenplanning permission.)  I am never anxious to call cases in unless reallynecessary, for frecuent call-in deprives intending developers of any confidence that their discussions with the planning authority will get them anywhere.7.   However, in view of the disquiet expressed in both Houses and inthe Press, I hope the Cabinet will agree that. I was right in deciding thatthere had to be an enruiry.   The L. C. C.  accepted my decision with agood grace.   I am arranging the enquiry as nuickly as possible, for thedevelopers have been endeavouring throughout to co-operate with theCouncil and they have a right to know where they stand without delay.When the enquiry is over, I will circulate a further paper to the cabinet before any decision is announced.H. D.Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, S. W. 1.24th November, 1959
