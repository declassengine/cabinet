(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C.(59) 19016th December, 1959COPY NO.   LfSQCABINETANGLO-POLISH TRADE negotiations memorandum by the President of the Board of TradeBacon represents 40 per cent of Polish exports to this country.As agreed by the Cabinet on 17th November (C. C.(59) 63rd Conclusions,Minute 4)    we informed the Polish negotiators that we could not contemplatea bacon quota for them of more than 20,000 tons in the first six months ofI960 and we could give them no assurances at all for the second half ofI960.    The implication clearly was that we might wish to reduce the quota for the second half of I960 to a figure even lower than 20,000 tons.    Theirquota for 1959 was 48, 500 tons.2.        The Poles have now said that, from their point of view, this represents a radical change in the whole situation.    They have therefore proposed that, instead of negotiating a new agreement for I960, we shouldcontinue the existing arrangements for the first six months of I960 and thennext spring negotiate a new agreement on an annual basis to run from 1st July.    They accept that we will not allow them a quota of more than20,000 tons of bacon in the first half of I960.3.        We had hoped to expand our exports to Poland over a wide range of products, including motor vehicles, machine tools and fish.    We had also hoped to sell them Viscount aircraft.    We had offered, apart fromthe question of bacon, to continue the effective quota level for butterimports (20,000 tons in 1959) through I960.     We had also offered increases in a number of other quotas amounting to some  1 million of trade.4.        All this is now thrown into the melting pot.    The Poles say that,in view of the uncertainty about future export prospects for bacon (which represents 40 per cent of their trade with us), they clearly cannot do morethan continue the existing arrangements temporarily until the baconsituation is clearer.    I must say that I entirely agree with them.5. This is a difficult and disappointing situation. I think the bestwe can do, and I ask my colleagues&apos; agreement, is to accept the Polishproposal which would involve:-(i)    A bacon quota of 20,000 tons for the first half of I960.(ii) An extension, pro rata, for the first half of I960 of allother 1959 quotas on either side. (This would mean10,000 tons of butter for the first half of I960.)-1-
6.        Our trade with Poland is on a strictly bilateral basis.    They willspend all the sterling they earn from us within the sterling area.    Thegreater part of what the Poles buy from us is paid for in cash.7. I feel that in considering our trade relations with Poland we must also consider our trade relations with other Iron Curtain countries, whichin total are very important and may be widely influenced by asty particularset of negotiations.R. M.Board of Trade, S. W.l.16th December, 19 59.-2-
