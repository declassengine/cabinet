(THIS*DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (59) 17013th November, 1959CABINETLANE DRAINAGEMiemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and FoodLand drainage is fundamental, both to increase agriculturalefficiency and to prevent flooding in rural and urban areas.     In England andWales farmers look after field drainage and farm ditches while River Boardslook after the main rivers.     But no-one is responsible for the watercoursesjoining the two.     These are often inadequate to take the increasing flow ofwater from the uplands, and in conseouence flood.2. The Report of the Sub-Committee on Land Drainage of the central advisory &quot;Water Committee (Heneage Report) proposed that River boards should become responsible for all these watercourses.     This is too sweeping.Some of these watercourses need little work done on them.     But when workneeds doing, everyone is agreed that the River Board should do it.     Theproblem is to find the extra money.3. At present the farmer pays nothing towards the cost of land drainage unless he is in a low-lying local internal drainage district.     TheRiver Boards draw their main revenue from the urban areas through theprecepts on county authorities.     This is unfair when agriculture is one ofthe main beneficiaries of land drainage.4. The proposals agreed between the four main associationsconcerned are that River Boards should be able to collect from agriculturaloccupiers outside internal drainage districts a general drainage chargeecuivalent to the county precept paid by urban occupiers.     These powerswiil be permissive.     It is, for instance, most unlikely that River boards in Wales or in parts of the West Country will want to use them.     But where necessary River Boards will be able to do more work and to take over manyof the intermediate watercourses.    In some areas, however, more may need to be done in the interest of agriculture.    In such a case, it isproposed that the River Board should be able to make out a special case to the Minister to levy an additional special charge on agricultural occupiersin that area.    The two charges together will not be allowed to exceedIs. Od. in the   Schedule &quot;A&quot; value.5. The charges will be based on Schedule &quot;A&quot; because there is noother valuation of agricultural land which reflects different land qualities.(Schedule &quot;A&quot; is already used as the basis of drainage rating in the localinternal drainage district.)    The general charge will vary according to theriver board area, but a typical charge might amount to 6d. in the  .     Thiswould mean that a farmer with 100 acres of average land would have to pay 2 10s. a year.    If, in addition, he has to pay a special charge, this might amount to another  2 10s. or  5 a year in all.    The corresponding maximum-1-COPY NO.
figure for both charges on 300 acres of average land would be  15 per year.These figures would be less in the case of poorer land, as the Schedule &quot;A&quot;value would be less.6. The Secretary of State for Scotland has asked me to explain thatthese proposals will not apply to Scotland, where there is no system ofRiver Boards.    Instead, the law enables owners of agricultural land tojoin together to promote drainage schemes for which Exchecuer grants up to50 per cent are available.    But local authorities need powers to deal withflooding in built-up areas.     The Secretary of State adds that there has beena considera-ble demand for such powers and a Scottish Bill to include them has been prepared, although it is not certain when it will be possible tointroduce it.7. We have a long-awaited opportunity to solve the problem whichhas bedevilled land drainage in England and Wales ever since the HeneageReport was published eight years ago.    The four main associationsconcerned are agreed.     They and many others, inside and outsideParliament, ha.d been expecting legislation this session, and are verydisappointed that this seems unlikely.    Pressure is increasing steadily.Unless at least an early statement is made, followed by a White Paper,the opportunity will slip through our fingers and criticism will continue tomount.8. I think the proposals are sound, flexible and fully defensible.I do not believe that they will excite much controversy.    I would ask for my colleagues&apos; agreement to my making, as soon as possible, a statement on the lines set out in the Annex, which has been approved by the HomeAffairs Committee.J. H.Ministry of Agriculture, fisheries and Food, S. W. 1.13th November, 1959.-2-
ANNEXLAND DRAINAGEDRAFT ORAL CUESTION AND ANSWERQUESTIONTo ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food whether he will now make a statement on the action which the Government proposeto take following on the discussions with the Associations concerned, aboutthe Heneage Report on Land Drainage.ORAL ANSWERWith permission I will answer this Question and No.       together.I am glad to say that, as a result of discussions with them, agree-ment was reached between the four main Associations concerned, namely theRiver Boards&apos; Association, the Association of Drainage Authorities, theNational Farmers1 Union, and the Country Landowners1 Association, on theprinciples which should be adopted for dealing with the main land drainageproblems considered in the Heneage Report.The Government have carefully considered these principles andare prepared to accept them as a basis for the preparation of legislation.I propose shortly to issue a White Paper giving the outline of the proposalswhich I have in mind.I will, with permission, circulate the text of these principles inthe Official Report.Text of the Agreed I: rinciples1. Every River Board would have the power to levy a generaldrainage charge on all agricultural land within its area outside internaldrainage districts.     Such land does not contribute towards the cost ofland drainage through River Eioard precepts on county authorities and internal drainage boards.    But the new drainage charge would be the equivalent (as nearly as possible) of the River Board&apos;s precept on countyauthorities in its area and would be intended for use primarily for extensions of main river or additional work on existing main river.2. When a River Board considers that there is a special agriculturalneed, it may put forward to the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Foodproposals for a special charge on agricultural land outside internal drainage-1-
districts.     This special charge could apply to either the whole or part of theiliver Board area concerned.    The revenue from this charge would be reserved for carrying out drainage work on selected watercourses, and proposals under this head would be approved by the Minister only if he were satisfied, after considering any objections and the report of any public inquiry, that a good case had been made out.3. The total charge (i. e. , the general charge plus any specialcharge) would not exceed Is. Od. in the   on the gross annual value forSchedule &quot;A&quot;.-2-
