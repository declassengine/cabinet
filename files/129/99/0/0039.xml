secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;8 GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1959C. (59) 189 Copy No.    g \15th December, 1959CABINETROAD TRAFFIC CONGESTIONMemorandum by the Minister of TransportSolving London&apos;s Traffic Problems Needs Additional PowersUnless we act, and act quickly, the centres of London and of other large citieswill be in a measurable time completely paralysed. The Christmas emergencyplan in London shows the problem is not insoluble. But those arrangements could in the nature of things only be for a limited period. I believe that it is, infact, possible to solve London&apos;s traffic problem, but additional powers will be needed to enable me to move with the necessary speed.2. Very briefly I want the Ministry of Transport to take charge of the congested central area of London (8 Metropolitan Boroughs). The idea wouldbe to make it a model traffic area and restore the streets to their proper andprimary function of traffic arteries. Long-term parking would be eliminated.Short-term parking would be controlled by parking meters. Modern trafficenginering techniques would be employed. To do this quickly new powers arewanted.I Need Powers to Spend Money and to Streamline Schemes for ParkingMeters and Traffic Regulations3.   Powers will be needed:  (a) MoneyTo enable me to make grants in respect of approved minor improvements to classified roads within an area such as the Metropolitan Police District andto do them myself if necessary, with power to recover an appropriate shareirom the local authority concerned.(b) Parking MetersTo enable me to modify or suspend such provisions relating to theintroduction of parking meter schemes as are necessary to enable these schemes to be completed and in operation within a reasonable time.(c) Traffic regulations to enable me to do the same in respect of other traffic regulations (e.g..provisions prohibiting or restricting waiting, one-way working, &amp;c, &amp;c). Inpractice this means regulations can be made without referring them to theLondon and Home Counties Traffic Advisory Committee.id) Off Street ParkingTo modify the procedure which has to be complied with by a localauthority before it can provide off street parking accommodation.56255
(e) Other provisions to make certain other changes affecting parking meter orders and the regulation of traffic. Some would apply outside the areas to which the other powers would apply. For example, we could provide for experiments in the paris disc system.In my view these powers should be limited to an initial period of five years,which could be extended by Order.1 0Traffic Wardens and the Ticket System are also Needed4. All plans will fail unless enforcement keeps step. I therefore warmlywelcome the proposals submitted by the Home Secretary to the Home AffairsCommittee and approved in principle by that Committee for the introduction oftraffic wardens and the ticket system. Both are essential to any scheme.Furthermore, when cars are towed away I consider the Police should have thepower to:  (a) Employ outside contractors.(b) Charge the owner the expense of removal and / or a fixed sum as a penalty.(Perhaps part of the penalties could be used for off-street parking.)At present the taxpayer pays.Off-street Car Parks will be Needed5. One major difficulty which requires resolution is the provision of furtheroff-street parking facilities. I feel most strongly that we shall have to demonstrateto the motoring public in London that we recognise the need for additionaloff-street facilities.  This could be done in two ways:  (a) By the construction of an underground car park under Speakers&apos; Cornerin Hyde Park, to house about 1,000 cars. Discussions have shown thatthis is a technically feasible project, and the Minister of Works isagreeable in principle to such a proposal. If this site could be madeavailable on favourable terms I have reason to think that finance mightbe forthcoming from private sources.(b) By the formation of some such agency as a wholly-owned Governmentcompany with a capital of, say,  2 millions which would finance by loana strictly limited number of off-street garages in key positions within thearea of Central London with which we are immediately concerned.Such loans might be on the basis that, after a due period, any profitsaccruing would be shared.I seek my Colleagues&apos; Agreement to a bill. I hope my colleagues wil! forgive me for bringing this matter before them before the final details have been fully worked out. I do so because authority toproceed with the preparation of a Bill embodying the necessary legal changes would enable me to go ahead at once with framing of the Bill in the field of trafficregulation, leaving the more controversial proposals, such as those relating to financial provision for off-street parking facilities, to be further discussed with theTreasury and the other Departments concerned. If we are not to be overtaken by events, I am most anxious not to lose the period of the Parliamentary Reoess, sothat fully considered proposals can be presented to the Legislation committee as soon as possible in the New Year.-   E. M.Ministry of Transport, W. 1,15th December, 1959.
