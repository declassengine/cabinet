SECRET   &apos;I 9 &quot;    151(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)C. (59) 171 &apos; COPY NO.13th November, 1959CABINETBANK NOTESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer have been discussing with the Governor of the Bank of Englandseveral proposals for improving the note issue.    They involve changes bothin denominations and in design.Denomination2. Bank of England notes are at present issued for general circula-tion in three denominations;  10s. ,  1 and  5.     There are at present about1,600 million notes in circulation, of which about 1,300 millions are  1 notes,This contrasts curiously with modern practice in most other western countries where four, five or more denominations are common and far greater use is made of notes of greater value than  1.    It is doubtless asa result of this difference of practice that the number of notes in circulationper head of population in the United Kingdom is 31 (even disregardingScottish and Irish notes) whereas in the United States it is 18, in the scandinavian countries about 15 and so on.3. Our proposal is that the range of denominations should beextended by the introduction next year of a  2 note and the reintroductionsome time later of a  10 note (which was last issued in 1943).    The case for extending the range of denominations in this way and in particular for introducing a  2 note is briefly: -(a) It will be convenient to the general public who, once theyare accustomed to the change, will carry and handlefewer notes in their day-to-day transactions.(b) It will save considerable time and effort in the banks andother institutions which handle bank notes in largequantities.(c) It will-secure savings to the Excheruer by reducing thenumber of notes printed each year.     By way of illustra-tion, if two out of every ten  1 notes at present in circulation were replaced by a single  2 note, thereduction in the number of notes in circulation wouldbe over 100 millions and the number issued each year would be reduced by about the same amount.    Inpractice the proportionate reduction might well be greater than this.    The scope for saving is clearlysubstantial.-1-
4. This is not to say that a decision to introduce a  2 note will beuniversally applauded.    The British public is instinctively conservative inthese matters and private soundings taken by the Bank of England and theTreasury have produced varying opinions.     We should not be deterred bythis from offering the public the opportunity to test, by experience, whethera  2 note would be a substantial convenience to them.    The need for a 10 note is not so pressing.    But there are clearly many circumstances inwhich a note of this denomination will be convenient and I think that it oughtto be reintroduced before very long.    The introduction of these denomination-tions will require Treasury approval under Section 1 of the Currency andBank Notes Act, 1954.Design5. The design and manufacture of bank notes is the responsibilityof the Bank of England, but the Governor has discussed the Bank&apos;s planswith me.    It was publicly announced in July, 1956, that The Oueen hadgranted permission for the preparation of designs for a series of bank notesincorporating a portrait of Her Majesty.    It is proposed that the new series should be introduced by stages beginning early in I960 with a new  1 note.The proposed  2 note would follow in the middle of I960, the new 10s. note in 1961 and the  5 and  10 notes as soon as possible thereafter.6. In the past it has been the Bank of England&apos;s practice to make eachdenomination of note in a different size. This practice will be unsatisfactoryfor the proposed new series for several reasons:-(a) Unless the differences in size were so small as to provideno useful aid to identification, the largest note in the series would inevitably be too large or the smallest too small for convenience.(b) The full benefit can only be obtained from modern types of printing machinery if standard rolls of paper can beused and if the machines can be easily switched fromone denomination to another.(c) The use of mechanical devices for counting and sortingbank notes in banks and elsewhere will be facilitated bythe standardisation of the size of notes.7. The Bank of England recognise that in view of past practice inthis country the issue of all five proposed denominations in a single sizemight not be popular (although it is accepted as normal in the United States,Canada and many other countries).    As a compromise they propose, with my agreement, to adopt two sizes - the 10s. ,  1 and  2 notes in a singlesize, a little smaller than the present  1 note but of the same length;   the 5 and  10 notes will be the same size as the present  1 note.    A differentcolour will be used for each denomination and particular care will be takento make the colours of the different denominations distinctive.t&quot;LK.::/;.::.
SECRET1530. It will take us all a little time to get used to these changes.     ButI am convinced that they are desirable in order to bring our bank notes upto date* and I invite the Cabinet to give them their support.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S. W.l.13th November, 1959.
