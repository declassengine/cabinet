(59) 58th Conclusions, Minute 7), I am circulating to mycolleagues the draft of the statement I would like to make on tho, setting up of anindependent enquiry into the working of the legislation which regulates the creation,operation and dissolution of companies. I hope to make the statement after questions on Thursday, 26th November.R. M.Board of Trade, S.W. I,23rd November, 1959.56158CONFIDENTIAL
2 cfifgssf^map -    157DRAFT statement in the Gracious. Speech on the Opening of Parliament an enquiry into thecompany law was forecast. The legislation concerned is the Companies Act, thePrevention of JFraud (Investments) Act, and the Business Names Acts. TheComaanies Act was last revised following the Report of the Cohen Committee onCoRipany Law Amendment in 1945, inevitably on the basis of pre-war experience,and the other legislation dates from before the war. The time has now come fora fresh review and this review must be thorough, not because we believe that thereis anything fundamentally wrong in our system but because ideas and practiceshave changed since the war and it is desirable to examine what modifications are needed in the light of recent experience to take account of these changes.2.   I propose, therefore, to appoint a committee to examine these matters withthe following terms of reference &quot;To review and report upon the provisions and workings of theCompanies Act, 1948, t$e Prevention of Fraud (Investments) Act, 1958,except in so far as it relates to industrial and provident societies and building societies, and the Registration of Business Names Act, 1916, as amended; toconsider in the light of modern conditions and practices, including the practiceof take-over bids, what should be the duties of directors and the rights ofshareholders; and generally to recommend what changes in the law are desirable.&quot;3. With the approval of the Lord Chancellor I have invited Lord Jenkinsto undertake the heavy task of acting as Chairman of this Committee, and 1 amvery glad to say that he has accepted. I hope to be able to announce the names of the other members of the Committee shortly.4. This enquiry will cover the general field of the creation, operation anddissolution of companies, the protection of the public in their capacity asshareholders and creditors and the regulation of dealers in securities.5. There remain the related problems of the protection of the public, not asshareholders but as depositors. As was stated in the Gracious Speech my Rt. Hon.Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer intends to introduce legislation concerningbuilding societies this Session. He is also considering the much wider question ofunsecured loans or deposits which are sought by many kinds of businesses for many different purposes and the desirability of new legislation for the protection of theinvesting public. Some proposals affecting invitations to the public to depositmoney, for example, the disclosure of balance sheets, may impinge on theCompanies Act, but the problem goes a good deal wider than this and action neednot await the Report of the Committee of Enquiry.6. Finally Stock Exchange procedures are constantly under review by theStock Exchange itself,&quot;and I know that Lord Ritchie, with whom I have discussed the matter, is anxious to examine any criticisms of substance that may be made.7. The savings of the nation are growing and Her Majesty&apos;s government consider it to be in the national interest that savers generally, and especially smallsavers, should be able to invest their savings in our expanding economy with confidence. We have, therefore, decided to set in train this comprehensiveprogramme, covering the whole field of private investment.November 1959.CONFIDENTIAL
