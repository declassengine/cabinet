Full lists ofthe Bills considered by the Future Legislation Committee in the lastAdministration are annexed.2. The Cabinet will no doubt agree that we should proceed withour eight &quot;main programme&quot; Bills in list B.1 - i. e.Horticulture (two Bills)Betting and GamingCriminal JusticeCharitiesLegal Aid and AdviceLocal EmploymentWeights and MeasuresThese are all referred to in the draft of The Oueen&apos;s Speech annexed to my paper C. (59) 155.   The &quot;essential&quot; Bills in list A.1 we cannotavoid and some of the &quot;contingent&quot; in list A. 2 are almost certain to be needed.3.        If, as I believe most of my colleagues feel to be desirable,our programme is to be less onerous than in recent sessions, these bills I have mentioned can be expected to leave us little time for anything more.   But there are certain additional Bills which, i suggest, we ought to include.   These are:-* Commonwealth Scholarships* Medical Auxiliaries (Registration)Caravans* Payment of Wages by ChequeJudicial Pensions* Mental Health (Scotland)* Succession (Scotland)* Building SocietiesThose marked with a star are referred to in the draft Speech.-1-
TOP^ECRET - j[34.&apos;       This is not to say that no Bills other than those mentionedin the two preceding paragraphs can or will be enacted during the session.  In point of fact a number of other, mostly minor, Billsare ready drafted and I should myself see no objection to their being introduced at an early stage.5.       But I invite the Cabinet to agrees-(a) that our programme should consist of the Bills mentionedin paragraphs 2 and 3;(b) that the drafting of these Bills should have precedenceover that of any other Billsj and(c) that no other Bill, even if ready for introduction, shouldbe introduced if its passage through Parliament islikely to endanger that of any of the &quot;programme&quot; Bills.R.
