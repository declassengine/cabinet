A copy of the Bill is attached. It is based largely on the recommendationsof the Royal Commission on Betting, Lotteries andHGaming;.1-949^ to 1951(Cmd. 8190). The Government^ intention to give effect to the main recommendations of the Royal Commission as regards both betting and gamingwas announced in the House of Commons on 9th March, 1956, the lines of theannouncement having been approved by the Cabinet on 28th February, 1956.The matter has recently been considered by both the Home Affairs Committee andthe Legislation Committee.3. As to betting, the Bill is needed and important mainly for two reasons.First, the existing law does not allow sufficient facilities for betting, with the resultthat much illegal betting takes place which tends to bring the law into contempt.Secondly, the police are consequently exposed to corruption and their relationswith the betting public are impaired. The only remedy for this situation appearsto be that recommended by the Royal Commission: to allow the establishmentof betting shops to which the public can lawfully resort for cash betting off thecourse. Part I of the Bill provides accordingly. The betting shops will requireto be licensed, and their number and distribution will be controlled, by the localjustices, and they will be subject to strict rules: they must not be used for anyother purpose; persons under 18 must not be admitted; there must be no loitering,no seats must be provided, and there must be no encouragement to bet. Allbookmakers, and bookmakers&apos; agents who wish to run betting shops, will requirepermits from the local justices. When betting shops come into existence, the penalties for street betting will be increased substantially.4. The Bill allows the Racecourse Betting Control Board (the tote board)to establish betting shops for the receipt of bets at tote odds or for transmission tothe tote. It also slightly enlarges the existing powers of the Board, and in particulargives the Board a monopoly not only of tote betting on horse races, but of bettingat tote odds.  (Clause 8 (1) (2).)5. As to gaming, the existing law (parts of which are very old) is also sorestrictive that it cannot be fully enforced. This again brings the law into contemptand places the police in an invidious position. Part II of the Bill accordingly repealsthe existing law and aims only to prevent commercial gaming by prohibiting themain methods of commercial exploitation of gaming (see Clause 10 (1)). Privatenon-commercial gaming will be allowed. There is provision in Clause 13 forgaming in clubs. The Legislation Committee have expressed apprehension about this clause and fear it may open the door to abuse; suggestions for its improvementare being considered.6. This is the most difficult part of the Bill, the difficulty being inherent in enforcing any restrictions in respect of what goes on behind closed doors. Themost realistic approach to the problem has seemed to be to allow considerableCONT^ibE^TIATL56020
2  &apos; CONFIDENTIALlatitude to clubs and private gatherings while preventing public exploitation ofgaming, and giving, in the provisions of Clause 10 relating to evidence and onusof proof, some help to the police where action is necessary.7. Part III regulates amusements with prizes: Clause 16 provides for them at bazaars, fetes and so on, and Clause 17 at temporary pleasure fairs and onpremises licensed for the purpose by the local authority. Clause 1.1 prohibitsgaming machines.&quot;8.   The rest of the Bill is consequential and procedural.9. There will undoubtedly be pressure in Parliament to add to the Billprovision for a levy on betting by bookmakers off the course. This proposal was not considered by the Royal Commission: it is both controversial andsurrounded by practical difficulties of great complexity. The Secretary of Statefor Scotland and I accordingly propose, after consultation with the Home AffairsCommittee, to appoint a Departmental committee to examine the case for a levyand the practicability of imposing it. I intend to announce this as soon as theBill is published.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W. 1,27th October, 1959.CONFIDENTIAL
