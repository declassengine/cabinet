Printed for the Cabinet.   December 1959C. (59) 1771st December, 1959CABINETLAW OF THE SEAMemorandum by the Lord chancellor on 5th November (C.C. (59) 56th Conclusions, Minute 5) the Cabinet decidedthat representations should be made to the United States Government urging them not to commit themselves, in advance of discussions to be held in London, to a recent Canadian proposal to put forward at the I960 Conference on the Law ofthe Sea a formula providing for a territorial sea of 6 miles plus a further 6 miles of exclusive fishing jurisdiction supplemented by the negotiation on a bilateralbasis of agreements for the continuation of fishing States&apos; historic rights in the outer zone. The Cabinet also decided that the Canadians should be asked notto approach other Governments on the proposal.2. The result of these approaches has been satisfactory. The United StatesGovernment agreed not to pursue the matter further in advance of the discussions with certain fishing States in London in November, and the Canadians promisednot to approach Governments other than Norway, who were already aware ofthe position.3. The Ministerial Committee on the Law of the Sea have now reviewed thewhole question in the light of the discussions at official level that were held inLondon with the United States and European fishing States from 16th-18thNovember. They have considered the attached report by officials, whichrecommends that since our preferred solution (i.e., a 6-mile territorial sea plus afurther 6 miles of exclusive fishing jurisdiction subject to the preservation of fishing States&apos; historic fishing rights referred to as Alternative A in the officials&apos;report) is most unlikely to command the necessary two-thirds majority at the 1960Conference, we should consider supporting a solution which would provide forfishing rights to cease in the outer 6-mile zone after a relatively long period, designedto avoid disruption of the fishing industry a period of 15-25 years is mentioned.This is referred to as Alternative B in the officials&apos; report.4. The Committee accept that Alternative A is unlikely to win at Geneva,and in view of the fundamental importance of reaching some agreement on the breadth of the territorial sea they recommend that Alternative B should be acceptedat the Conference by the United Kingdom Delegation as a fall-back position.5. It is, however, not certain that a two-thirds majority of votes for alternative B can be secured, and a great deal will depend on the tactics employedfrom now on. The Committee are of opinion that it would be wrong to come outopenly in support of Alternative B now, since this shift in our position would undoubtedly encourage other States to secure support for more extreme demands which if adopted would be very damaging to all our interests. They therefore recommend that we should not admit that we have departed from our previousposition and that attempts should be made to induce some other country preferably Canada to sponsor Alternative B at the Conference.6. If we are to have any chance of securing a two-thirds majority at theConference for Alternative B there will have to be a great deal of lobbying inadvance.   The United States propose to try to secure the support of the SouthCopy No,THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYS GOVERNMENT
American and some other countries for the proposal, but before doing so they are anxious to know whether we should be willing to accept it, and the Attorney-Generalis to have discussions with the United States authorities during a visit to Washington on 4th December.7. The majority of the Committee feel that we should take the United states authorities fully into our confidence and work closely with them in seeking supportloft Alternative B, The Attorney-General should inform them in confidence ofour position; indicate that we should be willing to accept Alternative B as a fall-back position at the Conference; and encourage them to seek the views of other states without letting it become known at this stage that the United kingdom would accept it. If we could agree on a common line of approach with the americans, we should then consider how best to tackle the Canadians, who arelikely to hold a key position at the Conference. We should aim at tripartite UnitedKingdom-United States-Canadian talks.8. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries, however, has some doubts about this course. Whilst he agrees that in the interests of reaching some agreement at Geneva we should accept Alternative B as a fall-back position, andthat in the meantime we should not depart from our previous position, he has somereservations about the degree to which we should at this stage take the Americansinto our confidence. Because of the risk of news of our agreement in the last resort to accept Alternative B leaking out during the course of the United Statesdiscussions with other States a position which would cause political difficultiesin regard to the fishing industry in this country he would prefer that the attorney-General should not commit us even in confidence at his forthcomingtalks in Washington to support Alternative B but that he should inform the UnitedStates authorities that our attitude to Alternative B would be influenced by theresult of their canvassing support for it among the South American and other states.9. The Committee therefore recommend that the Cabinet should endorse theCommittee&apos;s views set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 above and should decide in thelight of the considerations in paragraphs 7 and 8 what instructions should be sentto the Attorney-General in Washington. The Committee propose to consider theposition again when the outcome of these talks is known.K.House of Lords, S.W. I,1st December, 1959.
LAW; OF THE SEAREVIEW OF UNITED KINGDOM POLICYReport by Officials . ..The purpose of the present paper is to review the policy of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment in preparation for the 1960 Law of the Sea Conference and to suggestwhat the next step should be. /&apos;Bases of policy . Annex I to this paper contains an analysis of the basic considerations affecting our policy. On defence and merchant shipping grounds it is regardedas important that the breadth of the territorial sea should be no more than 6 miles.On fishery grounds it is necessary to pay, and be seen to pay, the smallest possibleprice in terms of fishing rights for the two-thirds majority which will be required at the Conference. These needs would be met if our preferred solute i (6 plus 6subject to limited historic rights) were capable of securing the necessary majority.In any event it is considered that Her Majesty&apos;s Government should aim to avoid the breakdown of the Conference, since the absence or non-recognition of lawwould mean encroachments on all our interests.History3. Annex II outlines the history of the United States and our attempts torally support for the preferred solution and evaluates opposing interests.Considering the latter first, it is believed that we can defeat a Soviet proposal for a12-mile territorial sea, and a probable Mexican proposal for an optional breadth of 3 to 12-mile territorial sea with fishery jurisdiction up to 12 or even 15 /miles,though the latter would be dangerous if it, or a modification of it, were to securethe last hearing at the Conference. We should also be able to defeat the Canadian1958 proposal of 6 plus plain 6, or a variant such as the United -States-CanadianOctober (1959) Proposal (under which the fishing States would have had theopportunity regarded by the European States as illusory to negotiate agreementsdeferring the cut-off of traditional fishing rights in the 6-12, mile zone) unless theUnited States supported it with their full influence, which is not an immediatedanger in the light of the recent exchange between the Foreign Secretary andMr. Herter.4. On present estimates, however, our preferred solution is certainly incapable of winning a two-thirds majority. It was provisionally approved (in the form of alternative A at Annex III) by officials at the 11-Power meeting held here on the16th-18th November, but on an optimistic estimate it could win no more than48 affirmative votes against at least 28 negatives.5. The European officials at the 11-Power meeting would not consideranything so unfavourable to the fishing States as the Drew proposal, which offered a continuation of traditional fishing in the 6-12 mile zone for five years and smallprospect of negotiating further extensions.6. Alternative B at Annex III was drafted by the 11-Power meeting entirelywithout commitment.  It would provide for (i) the &quot; cut-off &quot; of traditional fishing rights after a period of years to be fixed by Convention; and(ii) the possibility of a shorter period of cut-off for a few countries in specialsituations such as Iceland.The period mentioned in (i) should be long enough to permit of the amortisation ofthe capital equipment employed and the redeployment of the manpower affected.This was considered in terms of 25 down to 15 years, though it was realised thatthere would be strong pressure to reduce the period at the 1960 Conference.European officials undertook to submit Alternative B to their Government for study,and we hope to hear their views within the next few weeks.
Substantive Problem7.   The main alternative solutions short of 6 plus plain 6 are the following:  (i) Alternative A.(ii) Alternative B.(iii) The Drew Proposal.(iv) The United States-Canadian .1959 Proposal.8. Faced with the fact that Alternative A is almost certain to fail at theConference, the main problem is to decide how far to go in making concessions tothe coastal States in order to secure the required two-thirds majority. The problem is complicated by the danger that by making such concessions the votes of fishingStates may be lost. With careful tactical handling it looks as though Alternative Bhas the best chance of success. A very tentative and somewhat optimistic estimatemade by United Kingdom and United States officials indicates that, if supported by both these countries and by substantially all the other fishing States, Alternative Bmight win the necessary two-thirds majority.9. If the cut-off period were sufficiently long it would of course be lessdamaging than 7 (iii) and (iv). From the point of view of the fishery interests therewould be a vital difference between a period of five years and one of 15-20 years.Tactical Considerations10. There is also the difficult problem of tactics. Broadly speaking, the maincourses open appear to be (i) adherence to Alternative A as long as possible, keepingAlternative B as a fall-back position, or (ii) abandoning Alternative A and workingopenly for the general acceptance of Alternative B.11.   Course (i) would have the following advantages:  (a) it would demonstrate the Governments will to preserve our fishing rights;(b) it is likely to be adopted by a number of other European fishing States;(c) It would avoid the risk that coastal States might be encouraged to increase their demands if they knew that the United Kingdom was willing tomake further concessions.12. Course (i) would inhibit us from actively seeking support for Alternative B.If. pursued until the end, it might result in our entering the Conference withoutreasonable, assurance of a two-thirds majority.13.   Course (ii) would have the following advantages:  (a) It would enable us immediately to seek support for Alternative B.(b) Alternative B, unlike Alternative A, departs in principle from the UnitedStates 1958 formula of six plus six subject to full historic rights because it. contemplates termination of those rights in due course. Mr, Deanbelieves that the knowledge that Alternative B would be acceptable to the United Kingdom might enable the State Department to influencesome coastal States to accept this solution and even in some cases towork for its adoption by the Conference.14. On the other hand, as indicated in paragraph 11 (c), active support by theUnited Kingdom for Alternative B might encourage coastal States to adhere totheir position or even increase their demands.15. In fact, it is very likely that the United States will now canvass for alternative B, whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government now adopt course (i) orcourse (ii). The above considerations indicate that the best immediate course might be to tell the United States in confidence that we accept Alternative B as a fall-back position but do not wish to disclose this to other States at least until wehave more information about the prospect of its adoption by the 1960 Conference.16. The Canadian Government are unlikely to retreat from &quot;six plus plainsix &quot; until forced to do so at the Conference. But it is believed that they would welcome a secret understanding with the United Kingdom and the United Statesinvolving a cut-off of traditional policy rights, though they would, of course, seek a cut-off after a much shorter period than we would wish. In principle, it would be
166SECRET3helpful to reach such an understanding between Canada, the United States and theUnited Kingdom, but it is thought that the question whether this should be dealtwith by United States /Canadian and United Kingdom/Canadian talks or by UnitedStates/United Kingdom /Canadian talks might best be left for discussion by the attorney-General when in Washington on 4th December.17. Sooner or later it will be necessary to try to persuade the European fishingStates to vote for Alternative B. It is thought, however, that it would be better forthe present to await their reactions to the conclusions of the 11-Power meeting,by which time we shall also have further information about the intentions of theUnited States.18. A decision to adopt Alternative B, even as a fall-back position, would raise problems of relations with the fishing industry in particular how and whenthey should be informed.Recommendations19.   In the light of the foregoing, Ministers are invited (a) To take note of the almost certain failure of Alternative A, our preferredsolution;(b) To decide whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government should accept Alternative Bas a fall-back position;(c) If so, decide whether Her Majesty&apos;s Government should inform the UnitedStates in confidence of this decision;(d) To reserve consideration of further steps until the Attorney-Generalreturns from Washington.November 1959.BASIC CONSIDERATIONS AFFECTING UNITED KINGDOM POLICYLegal considerartions the paramount need is for a new rule of law regarding the breadth of theterritorial sea and fishing limits. The Cabinet agreed in February 1959, that the1960 Conference must not fail to adopt a Convention on these subjects. Otherwiseirresponsible States will assert claims to 12 miles or more of territorial sea andto fishery jurisdiction over the continental shelf claims which may provedifficult to oppose.Defence Considerations2. Subject to the overriding consideration that the Conference must not fail (and this proviso remains to be cleared with the Chiefs of Staff whom therehas not been time to consult), our defence requirement is that the breadth of the.territorial sea should not be more than 6 miles. There must be no revision ofthe 1958 Convention on the High Seas (not yet ratified) which avoids specifyingthat the innocent passage of warships should be subject to the permission of the coastal State. Equally there should be no discussion at the Conference of theoverflight of the territorial sea by State (military) aircraft; no right of overflightexists and our concern is to avoid the affirmation of this position lest our practiceof overflying (e.g., Spanish waters) should be jeopardised.Shipping and Civil Aviation Considerations3.   Assuming that the 1958 Convention on the Territorial Seas comes intoforce with its provisions for innocent passage, our shipping is interested in the:breadth of the territorial sea to the extent that the wider the area, subject to annex I
contraventions of those provisions the greater is the expense and inconvenienceof the necessary detours and delays. An extension of the territorial sea to 12 mileswould create many more opportunities for interference with customary shippingroutes than would an extension to 6 miles. The Ministry of Transport therefore consider that no more than a 6-mile limit should be conceded.4. At the same time, if the alternative to a 12-mile limit were the absenceof arty agreed limit, there are powerful counter-arguments. If a state of uncertaintyexists as to the legal position in respect of the territorial rights on a number o?coastal routes, there is an increased risk of incidents which, though possibly trivialin origin, may have serious and lasting consequences. The balance of advantage(having regard to merchant shipping interests) may therefore lie in the reluctantacceptance of a 12-mile territorial sea rather than allow the Conference to breakdown. The Ministry of Transport would wish to consult the shipping industry atthe appropriate time before supporting such a conclusion.5.   Our civil aviation interests are reasonably protected under the ChicagoConvention and the International Air Services Transit Agreement.Fishery Interests6. Narrow fishery limits are the interest of the United Kingdom fishing industry. The distant and middle-water fleets fish off the coasts of several north atlantic countries. These fleets provide about 60 per cent, of the total UnitedKingdom catch and comprise some 300 vessels based on the major fishing ports of Hull, Grimsby, Aberdeen and Fleetwood. An estimated 15 per cent, of theiroverall catch is taken on overseas grounds between 6 and 12 miles from existing base-lines. This loss could not be recouped outside the 12 miles andthe mere figure of 15 per cent, does not adequately express the likely damage ifthe grounds within 12 miles were denied to these fleets. The seasonal and areapattern of fishing would be very seriously disrupted; the losses in the winter andspring months when the markets are at their best would be especially grave;and the fleets might well become quite unprofitable in operation and face the choice of drastic diminution or of becoming State pensioners. These fleetsrepresent a capital investment of roughly  70 imillions at replacement values, apartfrom shore installations, and they employ over 5,000 fishermen as well as largenumbers of shore workers.7. We must expect that, if the 1960 Conference were to adopt a 12-milefishery limit as the general rule, countries such as Iceland would demand at theConference and might obtain special treatment which would involve something more for themselves. Iceland seeks to exclude foreign fishing from her continental shelf, where one-quarter of the total United Kingdom catch is obtained. Anysuccessful claim to more than 12 miles though less than the continental shelf for&quot; special situation &quot; countries such as Iceland and the Faroes would much increasethe figure of loss of 15 per cent, for the distant and middle-water fleets given above.8. Some small part of the figure of 15 per cent, loss has been suffered atIceland since the 12-mile limit was declared and naval protection began, and willbe suffered at the Faroes as a result of the new limits established by the Anglo-Danish Agreement of 1959. However, catches at Iceland this spring and summerwhen our fleets have been fishing within 12 miles under naval protection have beenclose to the average of previous years. (During the preceding winter catches werematerially lower than normal, because last winter we allowed no fishing at all, evenoutside 12 miles, off the north and west coasts of Iceland.) At the Faroes therehas as yet been virtually no loss of catch as a result of the 6-mile limit which began to apply at the end of April this year. Some loss must be expected in the winter,and the early spring months, when the prohibition of trawling within certain areasbetween 6 and 12 miles will apply. The fish&apos;catch at the&apos;Faroes, however, is a relatively small part of the total United Kingdom catch and the above figure of15 per cent, loss will not be much changed. 1 .-, ,9. The recoupment of the losses which&apos;12-mile limits in the North Atlanticwould impose could only be effected by ranging wider afield and this would require ythe building of vessels of greater capacity Or of new types, and a willingness on thepart of the United Kingdom consumer to change his taste in fish. If there were a cut-off period of 20 years or so, the rebuilding of the fleets and the redeploymentof manpower and shore installations could be effected without drastic upheaval
and with the minimum of Government aid. On the other hand, a cut-off periodof, say, five years, would give quite insufficient time for reorganisation and therewould inevitably be a need for heavy financial assistance.10. The establishment of a 12-mile limit around the United Kingdom wouldnot assist the distant and middle-water fleets, which Could not economically operatethere, and there would be little gain to the near-water fleets (which would be losses from extensions of fish limits) since there is not a great deal of foreign fishing within12 miles of the United Kingdom except for shellfish, The smaller in-shore UnitedKingdom fishermen would be the ones to benefit from a 12-mile fishery limit aroundour coasts.11. Unlike the United Kingdoms interests, those of our colonial territories would be better served by a 12-mile fishery limit.External Political Considerations12. In the Foreign Office view the requirement for a new rule of law isparamount. In the past 30 years we have missed opportunities to settle for morefavourable rules than the 1960 Conference is likely to adopt, and Sir GeraldFitzmaurice is of the opinion that if this Conference fails no other will be called for many years.13. Alignment with the United States and the rest of the Atlantic community is considered necessary as a matter of foreign policy as well as of our particular interests at the 1960 Conference. It is politically important also that before or asa result of the Conference, the strain upon our relations with Iceland should bealleviated.14. The Commonwealth Relations Office are equally concerned that solidaritywithin the Atlantic Community should be achieved, since the crux of this problem is to square United Kingdom and Canadian policy; on this all hopes of commonwealth unity on the law of the sea depend.Preferred Solution15. In the light of all the foregoing, the preferred solution of the UnitedKingdom (and of the United States, save for recent doubts) has been 6 plus 6subject to limited historic rights. This formula, which would meet the requirementsof United Kingdom policy has been embodied in provisional draft Articles of aConvention, in the form of Alternative A at Annex III, at the meeting of officials of fishing States in London on the 16th-18th November.ANNEX IITHE ATTITUDE OF OTHER STATESRather than pursue chronologically the soundings which the United Kingdomand the United States have taken during the last nine months, it is convenient toconsider three main aspects of the international position, viz:-reactions to our preferred solution;proposals which threaten basic United Kingdom interests, other than Canada&apos;s;Canadian thinking; andthe November meeting of officials.Reactions to the Preferred Solution. 2. Generally speaking, the indefinite preservation of limited &quot;historic&quot;rights would be acceptable to virtually all the fishing States. They would no doubt be supported by most of the land-locked west European States and we could hope for support also from States which would like a solution which was fair. Therewould be still wider support if the preferred solution were backed by the UnitedStates and if the latter used political pressure. ,
3. As far as the Commonwealth is concerned the crucial member, apart from canada, is India, which is uncommitted at present and is likely to remain so untilthe Conference opens when considerations of international politics are likely to govern her attitude. Australia and New Zealand are disturbed by the division between the United Kingdom and Canada: they have few material interests whichwould lead them to seek or oppose special fishery provisions but are fully conscious of Western security needs and the implications of Indonesian claims on archipelagicwaters, and would in the final analysis support the United Kingdom unless theUnited States were aligned with Canada against her. South Africa could beexpected to support the United Kingdom, as probably, could Pakistan; in thelatter case it appears that the danger of adhesion to the Arab bloc is small. malaya and Ceylon both have fishing communities which fish near the coasts of other Statesand might, therefore, sympathise with the fishing States provided they could resistpressures to support the Afro-Asian group in general and India is particular.Ghana has declared unequivocally that she prefers a 12-mile territorial sea but could perhaps be moved from this position. Outside the Commonwealth, theIrish Republic is a coastal and not a fishing State, but would take a reasonableline in order to secure the rule of law on matters affecting territorial waters andfishery limits. %4. On the other hand there is considerable feeling that the safeguarding of limited traditional fishing rights requires too complicated and vulnerable a formula to win overwhelming support at Geneva.Threatening Proposals, other than Canada&apos;s5. The Soviet bloc, supported by the Arab League, are expected to submitan Article providing for a 12-mile territorial sea. It should be possible to defeatthis because we know of no likely defectors from the 47 States which opposed itin 1958.6. India, Mexico and a wide geographical range of sponsors are, however,practically certain to step in with a proposal for an optional territorial sea of3 to 12 miles. This, which also means a maximum breadth of 12 miles, could equallybe defeated, but the vote against it was no more than 38 out of 86 in 1958. Unlessthe Atlantic States have a winning solution in reserve there is a risk that the 3 to12-mile proposal may be left alone in the field and be potentially very dangerous.7. Mexico has in mind a possible amendment to the 3-12-mile proposal,offering fishery jurisdiction up to 12 (or possible 15) miles for those States whichclaim less than the full 12 miles territorial sea. This would enhance the dangerfor us, particularly if it were used tactically as a device to secure the last hearing.Canadian Thinking8. Despite our best efforts from February to August, and despite the intervention of the Prime Minister, Canada has not abandoned her stand upon her1958 proposal for 6 plus plain 6. The Canadian attitude, which is compounded ofinternal political commitments and external political ambitions to play a major part at the Conference, is very firm though it is not completely rigid.9. The most that Canada would offer us (in the confidential draft proposedby Mr. Drew on 16th June) was her June proposal which offered only five years before the cut-off of traditional fishing, and small prospect of negotiating furtherextensions. After consulting the United States, the United Kingdom submitted inJuly a counter-draft which would have preserved traditional fishing unless other arrangements were negotiated. But we undertook in August to reconsider the june proposal when our counter-draft was rejected out of hand; and we asked the canadians also to look at it again.10. The United States, after similarly disapproving the Canadian JuneProposal, changed their view without consulting us and on 23rd October theyprovisionally agreed with Canada what may be called the October Proposal, i.e., theadoption of the 6 plus plain 6 formula, to be supplemented by bilateral or regionalagreements between coastal States and fishing States for the &quot; tapering-off &quot; (i.e.,cut-off) of traditional fishing rights.   In response to our representations however
the United States said that further steps would depend on the attitude of the UnitedKingdom and European officials at the mid-November meeting in London; theproposal was emphatically rejected there and it is expected that the United states will inform Canada shortly that it is unworkable.11. The Canadians consider that their June (Drew) Proposal is out of play.It is believed, however, that they might consider an ultimate compromise on&quot; 6 plus 6 with a cut-off by convention &quot;, although with a shorter cut-off than weshould wish.The November Meeting of Officials12. The last stage of international consultations, between officials of theUnited Kingdom, European fishing States, Turkey (with &quot; coastal &quot; and defence interests) and the United States, has resulted both in the provisional formulation of our preferred proposal (Alternative A at Annex III) and also in a draftdescription (Alternative B at Annex III) of the kind of phasing-out convention which all the Governments involved are being asked to examine as a possiblefall-back solution which might win the necessary two-thirds majority.ANNEX IIIAlternative AArticle 1The maximum breadth of the territorial sea of any State shall be 6 miles. Forthe purpose of the present Convention the term &quot; mile&quot; means a sea mile(1,852 metres) reckoned at 60 to 1 degree of latitude.Article 2Subject to the provisions of the present Convention, the coastal State shall haveexclusive fishing rights in a zone extending from the outer limit of its territorial seato a maximum distance of 12 miles measured from the base line from which the breadth of its territorial sea is measured.Article 3Any State whose vessels have made a practice of fishing in the zone referred toin Article 2 of the present Convention during the period of five years immediately preceding the 1st January, 1958, may, after giving notice to the coastal State, continueto fish, for the same classes of fish, within the said zone to an extent not exceeding the annual average level of fishing the former State carried on in the said zone duringthe said period of five years. The notice provided for in this Article shall be givenupon the ratification of the. present Convention.(Provisional)Article 4(1) If the coastal State disputes a claim to have made a practice of fishing inthe said outer 6 miles during the said period of five years, the matter shallimmediately be referred for a ruling to a special commission of five members appointed by [the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of theUnited Nations]. The members of this commission shall be well qualified personswho are nationals of other States and who specialise in legal or technical questions relating to fisheries.(2) The onus shall rest on the claimant State of establishing its claim before thespecial commission.(3) Pending a ruling by the special commission, the vessels of the claimant state shall be entitled to continue to fish within the outer 6 miles. Should the claim notbe established, that Sta,te&apos;s vessels shall not be entitled to fish within the outersix miles.
171Article 5(1) At any time after notice of a claim, negotiations may be entered into atthe request of either Stateid) For the purpose of determining the extent to which, in accordance withthe provisions of Article 3 of the present Convention, fishing may becarried on by vessels of the State which has preferred the claim; and(b) For the purpose of agreeing upon the areas within the zone referred toin Article 2 of the present Convention where such vessels may fish;such areas shall either be those areas within which such vessels madea practice of fishing during the period of five years referred to inArticle 3 of the present Convention, or, in substitution therefore, such other areas within the said zone in which it is to be expected thatfishing to the same extent as in the said period of five years will yieldin weight and value approximately the same catch.(2) In the event of disagreement on any or all of these matters, the disputeshall, at the instance of either party, be submitted for settlement to a special commission constituted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) ofArticle 4 of the present Convention.Any State whose vessels are entitled, under the provisions of the presentConvention, to continue fishing within the outer 6 miles shall introduce such measures of control and enforcement as are necessary to ensure that its vesselsdo not exceed the annual average level of fishing carried on by the vessels of that state in the outer 6 miles during the period of five years referred to in the presentConvention. Such measures shall be notified to the coastal State. At the requestof either State, negotiations shall be entered into with a view to ensuring that themeasures of control and enforcement are satisfactory.During the London talks other possibilities were discussed and, in particular,the question of bringing to an end the exercise of historic rights after the expiration of a predetermined period. It was agreed that such an alternative (described below) should be presented to Governments for consideration but that the presentation and study of this alternative would in no way commit either delegationsor Governments.In the consideration of any proposal for the termination of fishing by foreign states between the outer limits of the territorial sea and a maximum distance of12 miles measured from the base line from which the breadth of the territorial seais measured, the essential requirements would be these:(i) there should be a period of time during which the fishing would continue;(ii) the foreign States should be entitled, during that&apos; time, to continue theirfishing at least up to recent levels;(hi) the period of time should be long enough to permit of the amortisation ofthe capital equipment employed in the fishing in question and theredeployment of the manpower affected.  This would mean a minimumAny derogation from these requirements should be entertained only by mutual agreement in respect of these considerations :(a) the fishing may be further limited in amount on account of conservationmeasures introduced under international Agreements to which the states concerned are parties;(b) the fishing may be further limited in time in areas where the coastal state is overwhelmingly dependent upon the fisheries for its livelihood and isable to show that its economy is suffering through lack of sufficientavailable fish for both its fishing fleet and foreign fleets within the zone in question.Disputes would be submitted to arbitration on the broad lines referred to in thefirst proposal.Article 6Alternative Bofyears.
