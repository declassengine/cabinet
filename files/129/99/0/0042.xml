secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1959C. (59) 19230th December, 1959CABINETPREPARATIONS FOR THE 1960 CONFERENCE ON THE law of THE SEAMemorandum by the Lord chancellor on 3rd December the Cabinet decided that we should not at present departfrom our basic position: this was to support a 6-mile territorial sea, and only tosupport a further 6 miles of exclusive fishing if made subject to the preservation of historic rights in the outer 6 miles for an indefinite period (C.C. (59)61st Conclusions, Minute 7). It was however decided that the leader of the UnitedStates Delegation to the 1960 Conference, Mr. Dean, should be informed personallyand in confidence that we should if necessary be willing to fall back on a formulaproviding for a territorial sea of 6 miles plus the retention of historic fishing rights in a further zone of 6 miles for a period of years sufficient to prevent disruptionof our fishing industry. Without revealing that we have expressed willingness tosupport the fall back position if necessary, the United States are now canvassingsupport for this solution among Latin American States.2. Further discussions have been held with Mr. Drew, the Canadian HighCommissioner in London, and there have also been discussions between the foreign secretary and the Icelandic Foreign Minister in Paris. In my opinion the attitudeof these two countries will be a crucial factor in formulating our policy for theConference.Iceland3. The fishery dispute with Iceland is a running sore which threatens to prejudice our position at the Conference unless it can at least be temporarily cleared up. In 1958 the Icelandic Government unilaterally imposed a fishing limit of12 miles. We refused to accept this decision because it was contrary to existing international law, and since then our trawlers have fished within the Icelandic12-mile zone under naval protection.4. It is most desirable that this naval protection should be withdrawn, atany rate for the period of the Conference. The difficulty is that by doing so weshould, however much we reserved our position, be liable to be regarded as havingde facto acquiesced in Iceland&apos;s 12-mile fishery limit and to give the impression that we would ultimately accept this limit elsewhere. Hopes of retaining anyfishing rights within the 12-mile zone anywhere would therefore be much diminished; and indirectly encouragement would be given to those States soviet bloc and the Afro-Asian group who are pressing not only for a 12-mile fisherylimit, but for a 12-mile territorial sea; the latter would be extremely damaging toour defence interests. We therefore hope to explore with the Icelanders throughthe good offices of the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Alliance, M. Spaak,a solution on the lines of a withdrawal of naval protection in return for theirallowing our trawlers to fish up to 6 miles from their coast or, failing this, forsome agreement involving the cessation of our fishing rights in the outer 6-mileCopy No.5956296
zone after a period of years. The chances probably are, however, that the Icelanderswill not be willing to conclude an agreement on this basis, at any rate unless weoffer substantial financial inducement, and they may not be willing to contemplateit at all.Canada-; &apos;f- 5. The Canadians profess to be as anxious as any other Western countryto avoid a 12-mile territorial sea. They feel, however, that no formula short ofthis has any real chance of success at Geneva, except 6 plus plain 6, he., 6-mile territory sea and a further 6 miles of exclusive and unqualified fishing rights.They are therefore canvassing support for this solution amongst other countries.We have asked them to enter into discussions with us and the United States onan agreed fall back position on the lines which we have indicated in confidence toMr. Dean, he., 6 plus phased-out 6, and although they are unwilling at present to agree to this, Mr. Drew has referred our request to Ottawa for consideration.The Problems Before Us6. Our fundamental objective at the 1960 Conference is on defence grounds to secure the adoption of the 6-mile territorial sea. At the same time we wishto preserve to the greatest possible extent our fishing rights in the outer 6-mile,zone. The problems before us are, first, how far we can go in trying to preserveour fishing rights without risking either the adoption of a 12-mile territorial sea or the breakdown of the Conference in which case States will extend not onlytheir fishery limits but also their territorial sea at their own discretion; and secondly,having decided our policy, to decide the tactics which we shall employ between now and the Conference, and also at the Conference itself. Whatever the policydecision a great deal of preliminary lobbying and consultation will be necessary,and since the Conference opens on 17th March a decision in principle will have tobe reached early in January.7.   The practicable alternatives appear to me to be:  (a) to come out actively in support of 6 plus phased-out 6, which we havealready indicated to Mr. Dean in confidence that we should be preparedto accept as a fall back; or(b) to fall in with the Canadians and work actively for 6 plus plain 6.8. Under either of these solutions our distant-water fishing fleet stands to lose up to 20 per cent. ( 4 millions a year) of its catch, and the middle-water and near-water fleets would also suffer losses. The difference is that under alternative (b)these losses would be immediate and would give rise to substantial political andfinancial difficulties in regard to the fishing industry, whereas under alternative (a)the losses would only take effect after a period which, we hope, might be long enough to allow for the amortisation of the capital equipment rendered surplusand the redeployment of the affected manpower. Furthermore, if alternative (b)were adopted the Soviet Union might be encouraged to denounce the currentAnglo-Soviet Fisheries Agreement, which safeguards for the distant-water fleetthe only other plaice grounds apart from those off Iceland which are within the12-mile limit.9. However, even under alternative (a) we could not rely on much grace inthe areas which are of most importance to us. Iceland is generally regarded as a&quot; special situation &quot; case; and even if a general conventional rule embodying a cut-off period of 10 years were adopted, the period for Iceland would almost certainly have to be shorter. We should then find Denmark asking for a similarconcession in respect of the Faroes and Norway for her northern provinces. Infact it seems impossible that whatever the results of the Conference Iceland would recognise a right of other States to fish within 12 miles of her coast. Consequentlyunless we were prepared indefinitely to continue naval protection to enforcean alternative (a) solution if this were adopted by the Conference we should probably in any event have to acquiesce in an immediate loss of our fishing rightswithin 12 miles of Iceland. The extra loss then involved in accepting a general12-mile fishery limit would be about 7 or 8 per cent. ( 1+ millions per year) of ourdistant-water catch, plus losses to the middle-water and near-water fleets, andpossibly the loss of our rights under the Anglo-Soviet Fisheries Agreement.
21H10. It seems unlikely either that our present fall back position (of a phasingout period of fishing rights in the outer 6 miles) can win at Geneva without thesupport of countries led by Canada; or that the Canadian proposal for 6 plusplain 6 can win without the support of the United States and ourselves. Only a united front is likely to secure our fundamental objective of a 6-mile territorial sea. The questions are which front and what tactics and timing should we employin order to build it up.11. This briefly is the position as I see it at present. I will develop thearguments, as seen by the Ministerial Committee on the Law of the Sea in the lightof recent developments, at the meeting of the Cabinet to be held on 4th January.K.House of Lords, S.W.1,30th December, 1959.
