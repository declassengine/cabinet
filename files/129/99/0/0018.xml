confidential -        128v .1(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST VS GOVERNMENT)C. (59) 166 COPY NO.13th November, 1959CABINETEUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the President of the Board of Trade and I will go to the final meet-ing in Stockholm on 19th and 20th November to agree to the draft Conventionsetting up the European Free Trade Association (E. F. T. A. ).    I havecirculated the draft (C,(59) 167).    I  attach a note by Sir John Coulson onthe negotiations (Annex A), and an explanatory summary of the Convention(Annex B).2.        The text is agreed, subject to a few minor points which will almost certainly be settled by officials before the Ministerial meeting, andsubject to a number of more important points, requiring decision by theCabinet.3.        These points were considered by the European Economic AssociationCommittee on Friday, 13th November, and it was agreed to recommend tothe Cabinet as in the following paragraphs.Majority Voting4.        The drafters of the Convention left open the size of the required .majority on those matters of procedure, consultation, complaints andauthorisation of derogation which, it has been agreed, should be settled by majority vote.5.        On behalf of the European Economic Association Committee i recommend that our Delegation should advocate 4*3, to reduce the dangerof obstruction, but if there is general desire for 5 : 2, we should accept it.Fish6.        There are two matters to be settled:-(a) The treatment of frozen fish fillets.(b) The Norwegian request for an undertaking that we shall not increase the tariff (orimpose quotas) on fresh fish.7.        On frozen fish fillets, we had earlier made an offer to remove the10 per cent tariff over a ten-year period, provided that the Scandinavianswould agree to limit their exports to the United Kingdom voluntarily ifthey threatened to exceed specified limits;   and provided that it was agreedthat we reserved the right to reimpose the tariff if the Scandinaviansextended their fishing limits against us.-1-CONFIDENTIAL
O0.        A formula has been found which, if accepted, will protect us onthe fishing limit point.    The problem of voluntary export limitation hasbeen more difficult.    Our last offer, which was transmitted to them onThursday, 12th November, after I had discussed with the President of theBoard of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture, is attached as Annex C.9.        We shall not get a reply before Monday, 16th November, and itmay be necessary for us then to decide whether we should, if necessary,make further concessions.    We have already gone a long way to meet them, and the Minister of Agriculture has said that he could not go further.10.       The points on which we might be pressed are-(a.)   To increase the maximum from 20,000 tons a year of frozen fish fillets to 25,000 tons a year.(b) To withdraw (or modify) the condition protectingour position in the event of an extension of fishing limits.11.        We shall also need instructions on;-(c) Whether we can agree to a standstill on our tariff(and not impose quotas) on fresh fish.We have undertaken to make a statement that it is not our present intentionto increase the tariff or introduce a quota.    Apart from the merits of the fresh fish case, the danger is that to accept a standstill would introduce a precedent for a similar standstill on the horticultural tariff in subsequent negotiations with the Six.Origin Questions12.       There are still a few commodities for which origin rules are notyet agreed - leather, aluminium, synthetic staple fibre, lace, woollen yarn,woven garments (particularly men&apos;s outer wear) and printed cotton fabrics.I recommend that the Delegation be authorised to settle these as best theycan.Revenue Duties13.       There are certain problems of the treatment of revenue duties.I recommend that the Delegation be authorised to settle these, too.Portugal14.       There is a special Annex in the Convention for Portugal allowingher to reduce some of her tariffs more slowly than the general rulesprovide.    This is a reasonably satisfactory solution and I recommendacceptance.Organisation15.       There are a lot of business arrangements to be made to getE. F. T. A.  started as soon after ratification as possible.    The only one  need mention is the choice of site.    Our partners in E.F. T. A. all-2-
favour Paris, for practical reasons, and also because it would lend support to the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O. E. E. C. ) and show that we are not divisive.    No other site has been mentioned.16.       If our partners were unanimous we could not demur from Paris,and we consider that the balance of argument for Paris is conclusive.Parliament17.       There will be pressure foi* a debate before the House rises, andwe think it would be best to have it as soon as possible after the text of theConvention has been published (probably in the week after the Stockholmmeeting).18. We shall need only minor legislation, which will not be introduceduntil February.19.       It is hoped that the signature of the Convention will follow quicklyafter the Stockholm meeting, and that the ratification processes will be finished by May, so that the first tariff reductions can take place on1st July, I960.CONCLUSION20. On behalf of the European Economic Association Committee i recommend that the Cabinet should agree to the recommendations on:-(a)	Majority Voting	(paragraph 4)(b)	Origin Questions	(paragraph 12)(c)	Revenue Duties	(paragraph 13)(d)	Portugal	(paragraph 14)(e)	Site	(paragraph 16)21. I ask the Cabinet to give the United Kingdom Delegation instruction?on fish (paragraphs 10 and 11).22.       Finally, I recommend that the Cabinet authorise agreement and subsequent signature of the Draft Convention, provided the outstanding points are satisfactorily settled.D. H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.

131annex aNotes by Sir John Coulson on attitude of delegations in the Official Salts,jobaden ConferenceAttitude to the NegotiationsAll the Delegations were most anxious that the negotiations should be a success and did not spare their efforts.     Most oftheir Governments (including now the Danish Government) have no serious political problems at home, except on isolated subjects.The Austrians are in the weakest position.     Although they havetaken a decision to join the Seven, their Government is evidentlysomewhat divided and there is considerable opposition from industry which has very close links with the Six.     The Portugueseare politically most anxious to join,   but there seems to be no support in Portuguese industry, which is frightened of the impact of highly industrialised countries on a relatively backward one.They are therefore in continuous need of something positive toshow that they are benefiting from the Association.     Allcountries will feel directly strengthened when the association is formed.Relations with the SixAll countries are anxious to reach agreement with the Sixin due time.     But they ore under no illusions about the attitudeof France, on which their information is much the same as our own.It is unlikely therefore that the United Kingdom will at present be blamed if no early progress is achieved.      The delegates ofthe Seven are mostly scornful of the efforts mode by the european commission but nervous of the effects which the Commission, andthe Six generally, are having on the American Government.There is little idea among the Seven about how agreement withthe Six can be reached.     The Swiss seem to count more than therest on the pressure which the formation of the Seven v/ill hoveon the markets of the Six.      The Swedes (and to same extent the danes) seem to be pinning their faith to some kind of tariffharmonization, approaching a Customs Union.      The others haveexpressed no firm opinions.Variety of Governmental interestThere is no clear pattern of interest between the countries of the Seven.     There are few subjects on which all threeScandinavians agree.     For instance, Danish agriculturalrequirements are almost as awkward for Norway and Sweden as for ourselves;    and Norwegian fish policy is embarrassing tothe Swedes.      All three share the same fear of penetration bythe United Kingdom and have made d-iff difficulties about the rightof establishment, but this is rather unreal except in the caseof Norway.The Swiss are in a position by themselves.     They- have a lowtariff and are opposed to tariff harmonization.     They are disposed to be tough with the Six when the can afford to do sobut lenient (e.g. in regard to textiles) when it suits them.Their delegate has posed as a warm friend of Portugal and austria, when Swiss interests are not affected, but can be veryfirm when they are (e.g. Austrian restrictions on the exportof timber).     The United Kingdom has been in opposition to the-1-
Swiss on a number of points but, in spite of this, we mustregard Switzerland as a valuable member of the Seven, thoughgiven to &quot;log rolling&quot;.     Portugal wants help from everyoneand gets a good deal of sympathy because a weak Portugal suitsnone of us.      The Austrians plead many special cases, butappear rather to welcome any pressure which helps to rationalisetheir rather antiquated economic system.In the negotiations hitherto the United Kingdom has not had any steady natural allies,  though our interest on individualXJOints is usually shared by one or more Delegations.     At timeswe have been rather out on a limb, particularly when it hasbeen a question of safeguarding our wider interests outside the sphere of the Seven.     This is particularly so in the many instances where we have to defend particular commonwealth interests or points where the Commonwealth as a whole isconcerned.     This tendency has been particularly apparent inthe drafting of the Convention, which of necessity containsbroad rules which have to be consonant with our wider interests.But there is no reason to think that, when individual difficul-ties or causes for complaint arise later in the Association, weshall be in so exposed a position and will not be able to obtainadequate support from other members.November, .1^59,-2-
This paper sets out in the &quot;briefest skeleton form the content of the Convention for a European Free Trade Association(E.F.T.A. ) which has been drafted in Stockholm (circulated as C.(59) 167), and compared it with the Stockholm DraftPlan (&quot;the Plan&quot;); which, was approved by Ministers at themeeting in Stockholm on 20th and 21st July,  and published as cmnd..  823.      The content on the Convention is basicallythe same as that of the Plan, and where no comment is madethere is no significant difference.      There were, however,certain gaps in the Plan which had to be filled in, and inthe course of transforming it into treaty form it wasnecessary to give precise definition to some not altogetherprecise concepts.      The following notes give the briefestindication of the most important points in each Article and annex of the Convention and record any important differencesfrom the Plan.2.      The most important points at which the Conventiondevelops end enlarges upon the Plan are in its treatmentof complaints ana voting procedures.      Complaints proceduresare dealt with below under Article 31 -      They may prove tobe of great importance in interpreting the obligations towhich members will subscribe and in particular the rules of competition in Chapter IV.      As regards voting procedures,the Plan envisaged majority decisions in certain definedcases not involving new obligations, but did not specifythem.      Wherever decisions will be by majority this isspecifically mentioned in the Convention;    otherwise decisions will be unanimous.      This use of majority voting is inaccordance with our ideas and indeed necessary for the properfunctioning of the Association.      There is one outstandingissue in this connection;    whether a majority should be fourvotes to three or five votes to two.Development of co-operation in the organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.)promoting the objectives of the General agreement on Tariffs and Trade (G.A.T.T.);    determination tofacilitate the early establishment of a multi-lateral association embracing all members ofO.E.E.C., including the European Economic Community.Chapter I.    The association the name, establishment and membership ofthe Association.The objectives:    (a) to promote expansionof economic activity, full employment, increased productivity and rational use of resources,financial stability and improved living standards;    (b)    to secure trading in conditionsof fair competition;    (c)    to avoid (/serious7sdisparity in the conditions of supply of area raw materials;    and (d)  to contribute to the development and expansion of world tradeand the removal of barriers to it.x Note yet agreed.-3-PR3AMBLE:ARTICLE 1:ARTICLE 2:ANNEX BSKELETON SiniMARY OF THE CONVENTION OF THEEUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION AND COMPARISONWITH THE STOCKHOLM DRAFT PLAN
Objectives  (b) and (c), were not in the Plan;(b)  is an improvement;    and (c) ,  subject to inclusion of &quot;serious&quot; is considered acceptable,,Besides setting out the general aims of theAssociation,  the objectives will be relevantespecially in connection with Articles 31(Complaints) and 30 (Economic Policies).    If theyare not carried out they may be a ground of complaint.Chapter II.   DutiesARTICLE 3: Import duties will be reduced in accordancewith a stated minimum timetable and eliminated.The timetable calls for a cut of 20 per cent on1st July,,  I9605 a second cut of 10 per cent on1 st January, 1962, a third cut of 1 0 per cent on1st July, 1963? and six further cuts of 10 per centannually beginning on 1st January, 1965? and ending on 1st January, 1970.    This is a minimum timetableand Members may proceed faster if they wish.    Therate of duty from which these reductions will bemade will be that in force on 1st January, I960;certain exceptions to this are provided for in annex A.ARTICLE i4.: Area tariff treatment.    This lays down thethree rule^s of origin by which goods will qualify for the reduction and elimination .of import dutiesif consigned from within the Area;    (i) productionwholly within the Area,  (ii) undergoing one of an agreed list of processes In the Area, or (iii)having 50 per cent of their value added In the Area.The administrative rules for the detailed operationof these criteria are contained In Annex B.    Therules will be examined from time to time in order toensure their smooth operation, but can be amendedonly by unanimous decision.The virtual completion of the origin rules bythis date was not expected when the Plan was prepared and represents a substantial achievement.It has,  in particular, enabled the Danes to removetheir reserves, which could have been a source ofgreat difficulty,.    The rules have been so formulatedas to meet the substance of the United Kingdom&apos;s requirements, but the effectiveness of their operation depends In practice upon the extent towhich we can secure reciprocity in administration and effective co-operation bv other countriesin the control of origin.ARTICLE 5; This defines deflections of trade and providesfor dealing with them.    There is an obligation to notify reductions in external tariffs and to haveregard to avoidance of deflections when changingsuch tariffs.    The Article spells out precisely thelooser language of &quot;paragraphs 29 and 30 of the
Plan.    Though it does not give the right of unilateral action in emergency we sought,  it doesprovide for rapid authorisation of safeguardingmeasures &quot;by majority, which should meet our needson this point.ARTICLE 6% While leaving Members free to increase revenueduties and internal taxes or impose new ones, theArticle provides for the elimination of anyprotective element.    This is in accord with thePlan and alright as far as it goes, but furtherunderstandings will have to be reached outsidethe Convention about which duties are to bereceded as revenue duties.ARTICLE 7&quot; Drawback is in effect to be eliminated.    from january, 1970, Area tariff treatment may be refused to goods benefiting from it.    The arrange-rnents to the same end for the period from 1962 to1969 inclusive are to be made before the end of1960.ARTICLE 8: Export duties must not be introduced or increased and must be  eliminated by 1st January,1962.ARTICLE S% Co-operation in customs administration isprovided for.Chapter III.    Quantitative restrictionsARTICLE 10:ARTICLE 11ARTICLE 12:Quantitative import restrictions must not beintroduced or intensified and must be eliminatedby the end of 19(59.    Global quotas will beestablished on the basis of existing quotas or trade in 1959 (with appropriate provision fornon-Members where  these are included in the newglobal quotas)  and the global quotas so established,will he cumulatively increased by 20 per cent on1st July, I960, and each succeeding year (provisionfor non-Members being excluded from the increase).There is provision that the initial global quotasshould not be too small.    For some commoditieswhere serious difficulties arise alternative arrangements may be approved by majority decision.The United Kingdom has one such case where alter-native arrangements for watches have been agreed withthe Swiss Government,,    These are minimum arrange-ments within E.P.T.A., and do not override other international obligations, e.g.  in G.A.T.T. , whichmay require restrictions to be removed more quickly.The Article goes beyond the Plan in providing clearlyfor global quotas and the principles of cumulativeincrease, which is an advantage.Quantitative export restrictions must not beintroduced or intensified and must be eliminated by 1st January, 1962.    It has been agreed outside theConvention that export restrictions and export duties on ferrous and non-ferrous scrap may be continued.Exceptions to Articles 10 and 11  are permitted in the usual cases, to cover protection of publicmorals, prevention of disorder, etc.-5*
Chapter- IV.    Rules of CompetitionARTICLE 13: Export aids and any other form of Governmentaid whose main purpose or effect is to frustrate the &quot;benefits expected from freedom from duties and quantitative restrictions are prohibited.Export aids are defined in Annex D.    If any other form of Government aid is practised and frustratesthese benefits, although it is not prohibited,  itmay be complained against and result in defensive measures being authorised by majority decisionagainst the country giving the aid.In this last respect the Article covers asclearly as possible the possibility mentioned inparagraph 37 of the Plan that it would benecessary to compensate for the adverse effects on trade in the Area of measures of assistancetaken to deal with circumstances arising outsidethe Area.ARTICLE lit.: Before the end of 1969 practices of publicundertakings must be eliminated which either (a)are equivalent in effect to protective importduties,  quantitative restrictions or subsidies,or (b) entail trade discrimination on grounds of nationality if it frustrates the benefits expected from freedom from duties and quantitative restrictions.    New such practices are prohibited.In their ordinary commercial dealings publicundertakings will be subject to Article 15 in thesame way as private enterprises.    This means that public undertakings in the United Kingdom must beready by 1970?  subject to normal commercial con-siderations,  to give no preference to UnitedKingdom over other E.F.T.A.  sources of supply;and United Kingdom exporters will be entitled tocorresponding treatment from other E.F.T.A.countries.    We see no difficulty in meeting this obligation and would expect to benefit from it on balance.ARTICLE 15: Restrictive business practices are recognised to be incompatible with the Convention in so faras they frustrate the benefits expected fromfreedom from duties and quantitative restrictions.In the light of experience further or differentprovisions may be adopted later.    The operation ofthis Article will also be governed by the complaints procedure (Article 31).    The Planenvisaged adopting the provisions agreed in Parislast year which contemplated elaborate procedures,including unilateral action by countries claimingto be damaged by restrictive practices.    these have been eliminated, and the ordinary complaintsprocedure (Article 31) will apply.

ExceptionsException from certain obligations of theConvention is permitted for the protection of essential security interests in relation, e.g. todisclosure of information, trade in arms,assistance to indispensable defence production,action in time of war, etc.Members may,  consistently with their other international obligations, introduce quantitative restrictions on imports to safeguard their balanceof payments.    The Article contains less thanparagraphs 15-18 of the Plan in that - to our advantage in relation to the sterling area - thereis no obligation not to treat Members lessfavourably than third countries;    it goes beyondthe Plan in providing for majority voting inrespect of the recommendations and decisions thatmay be made if persistent balance of payments difficulties have a seriously damaging or dis-disturbing effect on the operation of the Convention.In strictly limited condrestrictions may be re-imposetaken if authorised by majorIwith difficulties in particulindustry that arise from the elimination of import dutiesrestrictions.

Chapter l&apos;article 21 :ARTICLE 22:ARTICLE 23:ARTICLE 2h:ARTICLE 25:ARTICLE 26:ARTICLE 27:ARTICLE 28:Agricultural goods (other than fish and marineproducts) are defined in a list at Annex D, which,with certain exceptions, corresponds to the agri-cultural goods in Annex II of the Treaty of Rome.None of the Articles so far described, except thaion dumping,  apply to agricultural goods.Considerations of national agricultural policy are recognised.    In pursuit of these members will have due regard to the    interests of othermembers in the export of agricultural products,Having regard to these national policies the objective for agricultural goods will be tofacilitate an expasnion of trade providing reason-able reciprocity,The conclusion of separate agreements foragricultural goods is recorded, and rules applying to those and any future agreements are laid down.Damage must not be caused to ether members bygranting subsidies on agricultural productsresulting for the subsidising country in anAnnual consultations on trade in agriculturalgoods will take place.The Plan did no more than record agreement that there should be a special agreement on agri-culture designed to facilitate expansion of trade,but provided for the conclusion of bilateral agree-ments in order to achieve reciprocity.    The fore-going Articles on agriculture are there for a spellingout of the Plan, but one which is acceptable to theUnited Kingdom,    A new point is that the complaintsprocedure (Article 31) will apply to agriculturalgoods,Chapter VI,    Pish and other marine productsThe special provisions in Articles 27 and 28will apply to the fish and marine products listed in Annex E,    None of the Articles so far described,except that on dumping,  apply to fish and marineproducts.Having regard to national policies the objec-tive will be to facilitate an expansion of trade infish which provides reasonable reciprocity,^Quantitative restrictions must not be intro-duced    or intensified and duties must not beincreased for these products^4-   An examination ofthe arrangements to he applied to the fish and marine products in Annex E will he concluded before 1st January,  1962.These Articles carry out the intention of thePlan that fish and other marine products should bedealt with as independent problem.    The outstandingissiies on fish and marine products will he dealtwith separately.4- Not agreed.
Chapter VIII._InvisiblesARTICLE 29: The importance of invisible transactions is recognised, but existing obligations are consideredsufficient.    Further provisions may he adopted by unanimous decision.Chapter IX._Economic PoliciesARTICLE 30: Members intend to pursue economic policiesserving to promote the objectives.    Recommenda-tions can only be made by unanimous decision.ARTICLE 31: Any matter may be referred to the Councilwhere a Member considers that it is beingdeprived of the benefit conferred by theConvention.    The Council will, by majority, arrangefor the examination of the matter,  and may refer it to an examining committee set up under Article 33-The Council may make such recommendations as are appropriate by majority.    If a Member does not,or is unable to,  comply and the Council finds by majority that an obligation has not been fulfilled,it may by majority authorise the suspension of obligations towards the non-complying Member.At the request of any Member wishing to take urgentsafeguarding measures, the Council may also, while a complaint is under consideration, authorise the interim suspension of obligations.The Plan recognised that a complaintsprocedure would be essential, to get redress from,or compensation for, frustration of the benefits to be expected from the Convention;  it did not exclude majority voting.    The procedures ofArticle 31  are therefore a substantial, butnecessary, development of what was agreed in thePlan.    The essence of these procedures is that,whilst majority recommendations may be made to members in a very wide range of situations,non-compliance with such recommendations can leadto the authorisation, by majority, of compensatoryaction,  e.g. suspension of tariff removal, againstthe offending Member only if it is found, by majority, to be in breach of an obligation.Members, in other words, will submit them-selves to majority interpretation of their obligations.    This is important where the obligationsare not clear-cut and especially so for those in chapter IV:    Rules of Competition.    In the case ofgovernment aids, practices of public undertakings,establishment and restrictive business practicesit may not always be as easy to pin down breaches of the obligations as in the case of the Articleson tariffs and quantitative restrictions, which havea precise arithmetical basis.    The complaintsprocedure, and in particular the resort tomajority findings on whether obligations havebeen fulfilled, may therefore play on important part In the general management of the Convention.Y/hether in practice these procedures will have sucha central position will only be discovered overthe years.

There will be special arrangements in regard to import duties on imports into Portugal .of goods which are produced in Portuguese territory by industries exporting less than 15 per cent oftheir production to non-Portuguese territory.There is a delayed timetable for the reduction andelimination of import duties on such goods:    theywill be reduced by 20 per cent on 1st July, I960,by 10 per cent on 1st January, 1965, 1967 and 1970;the timetable for their subsequent reduction from50 per cent to nil   will be decided by unanimousvote and elimination will take place not later than January, 1980.    New or higher duties may beintroduced for infant industries where such arenecessary to develop specific production, and arenot higher than the normal level of Portugueseduties on similar products.    These duties must be progressively reduced and eliminated by 1st January, 1930.Plan,These arrangements were not spelt out in thel, but follow fairly closely the proposals madeby Portuguese Ministers at the Ministerialconference in Saltsjobaden in July.Portugal will also be free to apply quantitativeexport restrictions on exhaustible mining productswhere this is necessary to conserve supplies for domestic industries.-12-CONFIDENTIAL
ANNEX. GTHE CONVENTION OF THE EUROPEAN FREE TRADE ASSOCIATION;QUICK FROZEN FISHThe United Kingdom Government have accepted, the exclusion of guick-frozen fish fillets from Annex E of the convention on the assumption that exports (including exports from theEuropean territories for whose international relations thethree Governments are responsible and to which the Conventionapplies) from Denmark, Norway and Sweden to the United kingdom are not likely to exceed an annual rate of 20,000 tons bythe end of 1970, and that the rate of expansion of exportswill be gradual and orderly.If at any time before the end of 1970 the United KingdomGovernment consider that these exports are increasing at anabnormal rate, the four Governments shall consider promptlywhat action should be taken to moderate the increase.If in any year in this period it seems likely to theUnited Kingdom Government that these exports will exceed20,000 tons, the four Governments shall promptly discuss thesituation.     Failing agreement, the matter shall be reportedto the Council with a view to finding a solution.      If no solution can he found, the United Kingdom Government reserve the right to reimpose the tariff when these exports in any year exceed 20,000 tons.Before the end of 1970, the four Governments shall consult with a view to making agreed recommendations to the Councilon the regime to be applied to quick-frozen fish fillets after that time.13th November, 1959
