confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   November 1959C. (59) 174 Copy No.    3124th November, 1959CABINETJURISDICTION IN KUWAITMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am afraid that I must trouble my colleagues with a complicated but important matter. The Ruler of Kuwait is pressing us to study urgently theanomaly of the present arrangement regarding dual jurisdiction in Kuwait, and toagree to terminate or at least substantially modify it.2.   Having regard to:  (a) the general trend in such matters;(b) the rapid evolution of Kuwait and its development of an internationalpersonality;(c) the Ruler&apos;s recent (for him) forceful insistence on his demand; and(d) the need to retain the Ruler&apos;s confidence,I consider that we must meet the Ruler&apos;s request.3. The matter however is of such consequence to our position in many respects both in Kuwait and the Persian Gulf that I am circulating the attached memorandum at Annex A.  This goes in great detail into the considerations.4.   The conclusions which I recommend are:  (a) Reduction of our Jurisdiction(i) Her Majesty&apos;s Government should accept the objective of ultimatelyrelinquishing Her Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction in Kuwait and the political resident should be authorised to inform the Ruler.(ii) We should endeavour, by all practicable means of persuasion, to ensurethat the Kuwaitis introduce suitable civil and criminal codes, penalreform and courts of law, and that our relinquishment of jurisdictionproceeds only pari passu with such reforms. We should not howevermake relinquishment irrevocably conditional on these reforms,(b) Making our Subjects Amenable to Certain Kuwaiti Administrative TribunalsWe should tell the Ruler that, as an earnest of our intentions under(a) (i) above, we are prepared to make &quot; our &quot; subjects amenable to theKuwaiti Tribunals set up (or to be set up) under the Labour Law, the maritime Code and the Port Rules. We would also say that we wouldin principle agree to similar cessions of jurisdiction to Kuwaitiadministrative tribunals in technical subjects as and when similarlegislation is passed in future.5. The telegram of instructions which I would propose to despatch, if theCabinet agrees with these conclusions, is attached at Annex B.S. L.Foreign Office, S.W.1,23rd November, 1959.56165B
ANNEX AREDUCTION OF OUR JURISDICTION IN KUWAITSince we gave up our extra-territorial rights in Spanish Morocco in 1956,upon the emergence of the independent State of Morocco, the Persian Gulf Statesf%e been the only countries (other than those coming under the Colonial Office)m which Her Majesty&apos;s Government have retained rights of jurisdiction. In Kuwaitthese rights cover British subjects and all foreigners, other than subjects of the ruler and nationals of Muslim States (excluding Pakistan). Our jurisdictionalrights in Kuwait are not dependent on the arrangements whereby we protectKuwait and conduct her foreign relations. They have their origin and justificationin the rudimentary state of administration and justice in Kuwait when relationswere established.2. For several years now, it has been generally advocated within the ForeignOffice that we must be prepared to surrender our jurisdictional rights when moderncodes of laws and proper courts come into being in the Gulf States; the legal adviser to the Foreign Office, for instance, recommended so in 1952. Even withoutany such reform we surrendered to the Ruler of Kuwait in 1957, at his request,jurisdiction over nationals of Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, Afghanistan, Indonesia andthe Sudan and certain protected persons (in addition to the nationals of otherMiddle Eastern Muslim countries, save Turkey, over whom he already hadjurisdiction). Since the nationalist demonstration on 1st February, 1959, in Kuwaitthe Ruler has enacted a number of laws of a technical nature which we have notable to reproduce entirely by Queen&apos;s Regulation because they contain provisions which would as they stand give jurisdiction over &quot; our &quot; subjects (i.e., all non-Kuwaitis save those mentioned above) in matters arising out of those laws, toKuwaiti administrative tribunals, instead of to the courts established for &quot; our &quot;subjects by the Kuwait Order, 1959. Meanwhile the resentment of the Kuwaitiauthorities at the continuance of our jurisdiction has become stronger and moreoutspoken.3. On 30th June the Ruler of Kuwait told the former Political Agent that he hoped Her Majesty&apos;s Government were thinking about the anomaly of dualjurisdiction, adding that the time might be coming when this convenientarrangement might turn into a most inconvenient irritant to relations between us.On 5th October, on his return from spending the summer in the Lebanon, the ruler reverted to the subject more insistently with the Acting Political Agentand has since sent his officials to pursue the matter with the new Political Agent;There is every reason to conclude that the matter will be pressed.4. The problem of our relations with Kuwait in respect of jurisdiction nowresolves itself into two issues (one general and one immediate):  (a) Whether we should accept the principle that we should progressively cedeour jurisdiction in Kuwait, i.e., bysurrendering it piecemeal as andwhen suitable Kuwaiti legislati^/*tribunals come into existence for particular matters.(b) Whether in advance of this general renouncement of jurisdiction we should allow &quot; our &quot; subjects to come under certain administrative tribunalsnow being set up under new Kuwaiti laws.(a) The Reduction of our JurisdictionFactors Against a Reduction5. The dispensation of justice is viewed by the Arab shaikh as one of therequisites of power. Justice in Kuwait remains therefore in essence the personaljustice of the Ruler. For this reason there is on the part of the present Ruler botha desire to extend his jurisdiction to everyone in Kuwait and at the same timeresistance to any fundamental change from his administration of justice to something more closely based on Western conceptions. We have for many yearsurged the Kuwaitis to improve their administration of justice. At present it remains(with the exceptions noted below) extremely primitive. There are no propercriminal and civil codes (but the Ruler has invited the Egyptian jurist, Mr. Sanhouri,to come to Kuwait this autumn to begin to draw up a civil code). The local judges
should generally use the Muslim Sharia tempered by local custom but in manycases their decisions are entirely arbitrary. They are largely unqualified and followvirtually no rules of evidence or procedure. A recent visit to a Kuwaiti prison hasrevealed conditions which would be extremely hard for any European to bear forany length of time. Floggings are still ordered by shaikhly judges as a form of punishment. All these factors should make us reluctant to abandon our jurisdiction.It may be noted that the United States have difficulties over the treatment of their10,000 subjects in Saudi Arabia where they have no extraterritorial jurisdiction(except within the airfield perimeter) and where conditions of &quot; justice &quot; are no lessprimitive than in Kuwait.6. The Political Resident (who favours ceding jurisdiction) has suggested thatif we cede jurisdiction we shall be faced with the need on practical grounds to seeConsuls established in Kuwait to protect their nationals, unless we undertake the considerable extra burden of protecting these ourselves. This argument is in essence sound but is not so strong or immediate as the Political Resident suggests.In the first place, of the eight countries which he mentions as &quot; entitled to Consuls &quot;the nationals of five (Iran, Iraq, Jordan, the United Arab Republic and the Lebanon)had already been subject to the Ruler&apos;s courts even before 1957. They have noConsuls and Texcept for Iran) have not pressed hard for them. The status of their nationals would not be altered. This leaves us with Commonwealth subjects, whom we would in any case protect (though we suspect that many Muslims of India and pakistan already submit in practice to the Ruler&apos;s jurisdiction in certain respects),subjects of the United States (who have a Consul), and the Japanese. To these theWest Germans might be added. Since relatively few people would be concerned,and since it will be some time before the progressive surrender of jurisdiction could take effect, it should be perfectly possible for the Political Agency to protect theinterests of those now subject to Her Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction, as and when theyprogressively pass under Kuwaiti jurisdiction. If this were later to entailreinforcing the consular section of the Political Agency this should be a small price to pay for holding our present position. If the Ruler decided, against ourexpectation, that for political reasons he would admit foreign representatives toKuwait, we could not of course prevent him: we dissuaded him from this courseearly in 1959, but we had in fact decided that we could not prevent him if he was determined to proceed. Likewise we ourselves would not be precluded fromrecommending to the Ruler that he should accept Consuls if for any reason ourpresent views on this subject should change. To sum up, our decision on the cession of jurisdiction should not be influenced by any fear that this will make the admissionof foreign Consuls inevitable.Factors in Favour of Reduction7. If we tell the Ruler of Kuwait that we intend to renounce our jurisdictionthe news will quickly spread to the other Gulf States and similar demands will be pressed there. This may not be more serious in Bahrain than in Kuwait. In Qatarand Abu Dhabi however the local justice is even more rudimentary and unsatisfactory than in Kuwait, and the dangers to the liberty and property of &quot; our &quot;subjects correspondingly greater if jurisdiction were renounced without priorreform. On the other hand, if we can ensure that jurisdiction in Kuwait is handedover only pari passu with suitable reforms, we should be in a stronger position thanat present for resisting demands from the other Gulf States for surrender of ourjurisdictional rights irrespective of prior reforms : such a demand has already beenmade by the Ruler of Abu Dhabi and is likely to cause us great difficulty.8. It is likely to become politically impossible for us to resist indefinitely the ruler/s demand for a reduction of our jurisdiction. To do so would sour ourrelutl^n^with the Ruling Family to a point where our, oil interests and, possibly,the RulenFeontinued investment in sterling, might be affected. It would also givecause, locally^fpr popular agitation against us&apos;in&apos;kuwait and, in the Arab-Asianworld, for propaganda that we were endeavouring to keep the Kuwaitis in colonial tutelage. W-^9. The friendship of Kuwait and her. independence in the Arab world are ofgreat importance to us to enable us to. have access; to Kuwaiti-oil on reasonableterms. We can to some extent ensure, both, by continuing to acknowledge ourobligation to protect her and; all that that acknowledgement entails in practice.Her independence in the Arab world would also be strengthened if she wereCONFIDENTIAL56165 b 2
recognised as .an independent entity by other countries. This is coming aboutalready in that Kuwait is a party to various international agreements and is likelyto join others, but it would undoubtedly be enhanced by the abolition of themanifest servitude of dual jurisdiction.10. In practice, boo, the Ruler will probably be anxious to avoid givingoccasion for international representations, and he may be expected to temper justicewith mercy as a matter of expediency.Conclusion on Need for a Reduction in our Jurisdiction11. Thus not only will the evolution of Kuwait take place at an increasingtempo, and with it demands for a cession of jurisdiction which it will be difficultto resist, but also there may be positive advantage in encouraging the Ruler of Kuwait in taking for his country the attributes of sovereignty of which theadministration of justice is one. The position in my view is no longer one of whether but of how we shall set about reducing our jurisdiction.12. The Ruler might for the present be content with obtaining for hisjurisdiction only mixed cases, i.e., those where persons now subject to hisjurisdiction are involved with persons now subject to ours. The Political Residentis however undoubtedly right in regarding this as only a palliative: the political resident recommends that we should accept that the total surrender of ourjurisdiction is only a matter of time and that we should so inform the Ruler. Ifwe were now to surrender jurisdiction only in mixed cases, this is unlikely to satisfy the Ruler&apos;s. family and in a very short time we should be faced with furtherdemands, particularly in cases where our own subjects had transgressed the newprogressive legislation being enacted by Shaikhly heads of Kuwait GovernmentDepartments, e.g., the Port Rules.13. If the principle of an eventual total transfer of jurisdiction is accepted,the question of safeguards and precautions remains. In order to protect &quot; our &quot;subjects, we should clearly do our best to ensure that proper civil and criminalcodes, penal arrangements and courts of law are introduced in Kuwait before weabandon our jurisdiction. The question is how far to press. The Political Residentargues that we should not try to insist on judicial or penal reforms. He thinks thatthe atmosphere prevailing will make it impossible to do so. We may be boundultimately to accept the views of the Political Resident and Political Agent on howfar it is possible to press the Ruler. Nevertheless it seems clear that the point should be pressed to the limit of what is politically possible. It would be. unwise to tell the Ruler that the cession of jurisdiction is conditional upon reform, but weshould point out to him how much more easily the process would go. We shouldalso explain the complications which may arise for the Kuwaiti authorities ifpersons now subject to our jurisdiction are for instance confined in prisons sounsuitable as to endanger their health or if they   are condemned by a code or ina manner repugnant to the vast majority of States. We must of course recognise,in our own minds, that reform may come about more slowly than we should wishand that reform and the cession of jurisdiction may not develop pari passu inpractice.14. Irrespective of any such reforms, however, we shall probably be forcedto agree to the piecemeal surrender of jurisdiction to certain Kuwaiti administrative tribunals as described below.(b) Making our Subjects Amenable to certain Kuwaiti Administrative Tribunals15. Kuwait is now participating in certain international organisations. this and the evolution of the Kuwaiti economy have led to the enactment, of various items of legislation such as the Kuwait Maritime Code, the Kuwait Port Rules andKuwait Labour-Law. We have encouraged the promulgation of such legislation aspart of the process of improving Kuwaiti justice and administration. Both thePort Rules and the Labour Law make provision for the setting-up of administrative tribunals to hear cases where the laws have been contravened. It may be presumed that similar provision will be made for tribunals in administrative or sociallegislation which is likely to follow. No Queen&apos;s Regulations corresponding to therecent Kuwaiti laws have yet been passed, and it is not considered practicable topass any until we have negotiated with the Kuwaitis the question of what kind of
ANNEX draft Telegram Instructions to the Political ResidentAlthough the Ruler might be temporarily content with the cession of jurisdiction in mixed cases only, I agree with you that a decision on the principle ofa general relinquishment should now be taken and announced to the Ruler. You,or at your discretion the Political Agent, should therefore arrange to speak to the ruler on the lines of paragraphs 2-4 below and in accordance with instructions inparagraph 5.2.  As I promised to the Ruler I have devoted further thought to this importantbut complicated question, and my colleagues and I have examined it in the spirit ofk friendship and sympathy which inspires all our relations with Kuwait.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government agree with the objective of eventually abolishingI the system of dual jurisdiction in Kuwait.  The Ruler will recognise that this is adeclaration of great  importance which involves considerable difficulties for Her: Majesty&apos;s Government They hope that he will therefore for his part also recognise&apos; that the change is not one that can be brought about overnight but that the Kuwaitii.authorities and ourselves must devote much thought to the means of effectingsmoothly and progressively the transfer of jurisdictional rights. The Ruler will-probably not wish to enter into details himself, but as an instance of the line on whichprogress might be made I am prepared immediately to endorse in principle onesuggestion already made by the Assistant State Secretary, The suggestion is that-jurisdiction might be ceded in particular fields as and when suitable Kuwaititribunal shall deal with persons under our jurisdiction involved in cases which ariseout of these laws. It has proved in practice extremely difficult to devise a tribunal which would be satisfactory to us and at the same time prove acceptable to theKuwaitis. The Political Agency, indeed, consider that such a tribunal cannot be negotiated at all and that there will be no alternative to our recognising the Kuwaititribunals and appointing them to act as if they were our own in oases involving&quot; our &quot; subjects. We have reason to hope that on technical grounds and in orderto satisfy our fears the Kuwaiti authorities would agree in practice (though theywould probably not consent to do so in writing), to the presence of a British member on such tribunals when our subjects are involved.Conclusion on Subjection to Administrative Tribunals16. Since we have as a matter of policy encouraged the Kuwaitis to enact suchmodern legislation which involves provision for administrative tribunals, and sincetribunals of this kind exist in a number of countries, including the United Kingdom,we shall be in a false position if we exclude &apos;; our &quot; subjects from the operation ofthese tribunals, if our only grounds for doing so are that the tribunals are composedof Kuwaitis who may wield their virtually unlimited powers in an arbitrary manner.We certainly submit in other countries to tribunals equally unsatisfactory by our ownstandards. We could, in theory, hold out on the ground that it would pre-judge thewhole question of renouncing jurisdiction if we allowed our subjects to be madeamenable to Kuwaiti tribunals in this way. If, however, the argument of the agency in Kuwait is accepted, there may be very little room for choice in this matter. Inany case, if we are to agree to renounce jurisdiction in principle we might as wellmake a virtue of necessity and do so in practice as and when suitable legislation and tribunals appear, beginning by informing the Ruler that we would agree to&quot; our &quot; subjects being amenable to the existing Kuwait Labour Law and Port Rules.This would mean a slight but significant cession of our jurisdiction as defined in theKuwait Order 1959, and an Amending Order in Council will have to be issued.Further Orders in Council might be necessary as and when further cessions weremade.17. In discussion with the Political Agency the Kuwaiti Assistant StateSecretary has already put forward the idea that jurisdiction should be thus cededto the Kuwaitis piecemeal. He agreed, as the Ruler had agreed on 30th June, thatthe Kuwaiti authorities ought to consult us while the laws were still in draft.
legislation is produced and parallel legislation is accordingly made by us: I assumealso that a satisfactory Court or tribunal would exist in each case. I have alreadynoted and I welcome the steps taken by the Ruler this year to provide Kuwait withlaws necessary for the running of a modern State.4. As an earnest of their intentions Her Majesty&apos;s Government are preparedto start by making persons who are ordinarily subject to Her Majesty&apos;s jurisdictionamenable to the administrative tribunals which have been established by recentlyenacted Kuwaiti legislation and which are guided by clear and fair rules or laws.Thus, Her Majesty&apos;s Government are ready to recognise the competence of theLabour Arbitration Tribunal to arbitrate in matters affecting persons subject to her majesty&apos;s jurisdiction. They would also recognise the competence of Boards ofEnquiry to rule on alleged contraventions of the Kuwait Port Rules by personssubject to Her Majesty&apos;s jurisdiction, and they would recognise the competence ofthe President of the Port to impose penalties on them. These changes represent animportant departure of principle. Only these two administrative tribunals exist atthis moment, but in principle the decision would apply to similar cases in future. if however the Ruler now goes on to suggest that traffic cases might be heard in his.Court, you would have to say that this was on a different footing. At your discretionyou could refer to this point as an example when discussing the question of reformdealt with in paragraph 5.5. It is essential to use every practicable means of persuasion to ensure thatthe Kuwaitis introduce suitable civil and criminal codes, penal reform and courts of law, and that the relinquishment of jurisdiction goes only pari passu with suchreforms. I agree with you that it would be unwise to make such reforms acondition precedent for the relinquishment of jurisdiction, and I must ultimatelylargely be guided by your view and that of the Political Agent on how far it ispolitically possible to press the Ruler in particular circumstances. nevertheless it should surely be possible to exert continual pressure on these lines. Since wehave shown such far-reaching understanding of the Ruler&apos;s point of view, he shouldsurely respect our own. Apart from our concern for the welfare of persons nowsubject to our jurisdiction, the Kuwaiti authorities will be exposed to internationalcriticism and representations if such persons in future are for instance confined inprisons endangering their health or are condemned by a code or in a mannerrepugnant to the vast majority of States.6. For your information, I do not think we need be deterred by fears of consular difficulties. Subjects of five of the eight countries are already subject tothe Ruler&apos;s jurisdiction. An increase in the Political Agency&apos;s staff to deal with additional consular responsibilities for other foreign nationals would be a small price to pay for maintaining our exclusive position, assuming that both the Ruler and ourselves continue to agree that this should be maintained. Since the problem will in any case arise only gradually, if the principle of progressive relinquishmentis accepted, I should not have thought it necessary to raise with the Ruler at thisstage the consular questions discussed in your memorandum. Please inform me ifyou still consider it important to do so.
