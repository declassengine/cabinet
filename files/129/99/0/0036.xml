THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1959C. (59) 186 Copy No. 5 611th December, 1959CABINETINTERCEPTION OF  COMMUNICATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department i have given further thought, in the light of the discussion at Cabinet on10th December (C.C. (59) 62nd Conclusions, Minute 8), to the question how farinformation obtained by the police ought to be disclosed in proceedings beforethe domestic tribunal of a professional body, and what measures might be takento limit such disclosure.2. In my previous memorandum (C. (59) 183) I canvassed the possibility ofproviding that where a professional body wishes to issue a subpoena applicationmust be made to a judge or master of the High Court. At this stage, the HomeSecretary would have an opportunity to claim Crown privilege where appropriate,and the police to object, on the basis of the decision in Marks v. Beyfus, thatthe issue of a subpoena would be contrary to public policy. It was suggested thata right of objection should be given also to the defendant, although there aredifficulties about this.3. I have considered the whole matter further in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Law Officers; andI have come to the conclusion that opinion in the House of Commons would notbe satisfied by the proposal I previously made. The whole matter is highlytechnical; and though I am in no difficulty in defending what was done in theReading case, we have to meet the argument that the powers of these disciplinarybodies may be excessive and could be used unfairly.4. The conclusion which I have reached is that the best course would be toappoint a strong committee, consisting of three Privy Counsellors, to consider thewhole question of the issue of subpoenas for the purpose of proceedings beforedomestic tribunals. The terms of reference might be on the following lines :  &quot; To consider to what extent and subject to what conditions subpoenasshould be issuable to secure the attendance of witnesses and the productionof documents before disciplinary tribunals; and in particular to considerwhether subpoenas should be issuable to secure the production before suchtribunals of information obtained by police officers in the course of criminalinvestigation; and to make recommendations.&quot;5. An enquiry of this sort is open to the objection that it might bring, underreview police methods of investigation and the use of Crown privilege to prevent the disclosure of information in the hands of the police. - The terms of referencesuggested avoid this danger as far as possible. An enquiry would also mean, nodoubt, that the further stages of the Professions Supplementary to Medicine bill would have to be deferred. Nevertheless, I think that the announcement of theGovernment^ decision to appoint such a committee together with an effectivedefence of my decision not to claim Crown privilege in the Reading case would satisfy the House; and I doubt whether this object could be achieved in any other way.6.   I shall be glad to know whether my colleagues agree.R. A. B.Home Office, S.W.1,11th December, 1959.56252
