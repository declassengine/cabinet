secret this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   December 1959C. (59) 18715th December, 1959CABINETNUCLEAR PROPULSION FOR MERCHANT shipd memorandum by the Minister of TransportSince July Officials have further considered a Nuclear Merchant ShipOn 28th July, 1959, the Cabinet decided that a small group of Ministers shouldstudy further the problem of nuclear propulsion for merchant ships (C.C. (59)47th Conclusions, &quot;Minute 5). The group never met but a good deal of further work has been done by officials.The Civil Lord&apos;s Committee had Recommended Inviting Tenders but makingno Commitment to Build a Ship2. The Committee under the chairmanship of the Civil Lord concluded that none of the three reactor systems likely to become available soon showed promise of becoming economically attractive in the near future. Of the three, the organicliquid-moderated reactor (O.M.R.) appeared the least unattractive, with the boilingwater reactor (B.W.R.) taking second place. The Civil Lord&apos;s Committeeunanimously concluded:  (a) Tenders should be invited for a B.W.R. and an O.M.R. in a 65,000 tonsdeadweight tanker. The object would be to establish more reliablecosts and certain safety features, and to obtain more information on thescope for development. There would be no commitment to build a nuclear ship.(b) Concurrently, the Atomic Energy Authority should continue intensivestudy of the O.M.R. so that much more would be known about thismore promising system by the time the tenders are received.The First Lord wanted a Decision to Build a Nuclear Merchant Ship3. The First Lord of the Admiralty stated in July (C.C. (59) 47th Conclusions,Minute 5) that it would be better if the Government decided now to build a tankerpowered by a B.W.R. This would ensure that we obtained early building and operating experience of a nuclear-propelled system. A third course was to proceed as the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee recommended but to announce firmly that a shipwould be ordered incorporating the reactor system which best met all therequirements.4.   It was these alternative courses that Ministers were asked to consider.The Shipowners and Shipbuilders Support the Recommendations of theCivil Lord&apos;s Committee5. In subsequent discussion with officials, the shipbuilders and the shipowners said that if the recommendation of the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee were adopted, there was a good prospect of a consortium of shipowners being set up and there might be some financial support from shipbuilders. A B.W.R. project was likely to evoke less response from both shipowners and shipbuilders becausethe B.W.R. ship has less scope for development. The shipbuilders also said &quot;thatthey would not want to see any relaxation in research into the O.M.R. system.Copy No.   6356256
2 . SElMfThe Civil Lord&apos;s Committee and its Technical Sub-Committee stillRecommend Deferring a Choice Between B.W.R. and O.M.R.6. The Civil Lord&apos;s Committee and its Technical Sub-Committee havere-examined the position but reaffirm their original recommendations.The Tenders May Cost up to  i Million ,( ff 7. It is clearly desirable in our present state of knowledge that, if possible,the scope of the tenders should cover more than one reactor system. &apos;8. The number of firms who would be invited to tender is five. Threeinvitations would be for a B.W.R. and two for an O.M.R. It is probable that,without some commitment now to build a ship with one or other of these reactorsystems, the firms will expect some payment against the cost of tendering. Onthe assumption that the Government would not contribute more than half of thecost of preparation of the tenders, the total Government contribution would be ofthe order of     million.The First Lord Considers We Should Decide Now to Build9. The First Lord of the Admiralty considers that the Government should reach an understanding now that a ship will be built with one or other of thesesystems of propulsion, provided the tenders show that it would be feasible. I dpnot agree. We have not yet enough information and we might well regret our decision later.I Invite my Colleagues to Accept the Recommendations of the Civil Lord&apos;sCommittee10.   I, therefore, recommend:  (a) That there is little to lose and possibly much to gain by following therecommendations of the Civil Lord&apos;s Committee, and that Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment should therefore call for tenders from selected British firmsfor the provision of a B.W.R. (three firms) and an O.M.R. (two firms)propulsion unit suitable for installation in a 65,000 tons deadweighttanker. Until the tenders have been received and it has beendemonstrated that the various design problems can be satisfactorilysolved and the price is known, there would, however, be no commitment to build a ship propelled by either of these systems. Decisions on thebuilding of a nuclear-propelled ship and the reactor system to beadopted would be taken when the tenders were received..(b) That the Atomic Energy Authority should continue, as quickly as is practicable, their study of the O.M.R. system.11. I also recommend that the Atomic Energy Authority should study theapplication of the Steam Cooled Heavy Water Reactor, which the TechnicalSub-Committee now consider to show promise in the marine propulsion field.E. M.Ministry of Transport, W. 1,15th December, 1959.
