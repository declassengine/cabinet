,- QCONFIDENTIAL1  %(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C. (59) 169COPY NO.   \ I13th November, 1959CABINETNORTH AMERICAN PIGMEATMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Minister of Agriculture has proposed, following a discussion the Canadian Minister of Agriculture, that theUnited Kingdom should: -(a) Admit a quota of 25,000 tons of North American frozen porkand agree to discuss next summer further arrangements for pigmeatgenerally.   While the cuota would in theory cover the United States and canada, in practice the quota would be taken up by Canada alone.(b) Reduce the ouotas for pigmeat imports from East european countries (primarily Poland) to balance the state of the market in theUnited Kingdom in the event of a further increase in Canadian supplies.This could be effected by reducing the quota for Polish bacon and hamfrom 48, 500 tons in 1959 to a minimum of 30,000 tons in I960, of which20,000 tons could be supplied in the first six months with a review inthe early summer of I960 as to the possibility of an increase for theremainder of the year.2. The Economic Policy Committee discussed this proposal on 11th November, 1959, but were unable to reach agreement.Background3. Before the war Canada sent about 68,000 tons of pigmeat ayear to the United Kingdom.   Dollar restrictions have kept her out ofour market since the war.   Canada&apos;s immediate problem is herGovernment stocks of surplus frozen pork .   We have previously offeredCanada a quota for 10,000 tons of pigmeat dependent on the signing ofthe Convention establishing the European Free Trade Association (E. F. T. A. )but this was found unacceptable.    Mr. Harkness has expressed the concern of his Government at the continued exclusion of Canadian pigmeat from our market despite the recent removal of import restrictions from many-goods.   The Minister of Agriculture thinks that the Canadian Governmentwould accept for the time being a nuota for 25,000 tons of frozen porkon the understanding that discussions about future arrangements wouldtake place next summer.   It is clear that Canada hopes to be able to market in the United Kingdom in due course from 50,000 to 100,000 tons of canadian pigmeat (mostly bacon) a year.-1-
145Arguments for a Canadian quota4. The balance of payments situation is no longer a justification for discriminating against Canadian imports.     We have an internationalcommitment not to use import ouotas protectively.   In addition,Canada was a traditional exporter of pigmeat to the United Kingdom andit is unreasonable to continue to exclude her from our market while we are taking substantial supplies from Poland.   In the short-term,imports of Canadian frozen pork would help to overcome the presentshortage of supplies for British bacon curers.Arguments against a Canadian ruota5. But the cuota opens the door to further Canadian supplies.Our farming industry would view this with considerable alarm unless they were certain that there would be a compensating reduction fromother countries.   Without such a reduction, the extra Canadian supplies would of course increase our own deficiency payments bill.   Moreover,Canadian pigmeat is&apos;subsidised and the new system of deficiency round to be introduced by Canada in I960 may not eliminate entirelythe element of subsidy.Arguments for reducing cuota for Polish pigmeat6. If supplies of Canadian pigmeat to the United Kingdom marketwere to increase, it would be at a time when the production of Britishpigs might be rising and when the tariff on Danish bacon would havebeen halved.   Our own industry, already in a most sensitive state,backed by a considerable measure of Parliamentary and public support,would be very hostile to such a situation unless the Government had taken steps to balance the market.   This can only be done by adjusting the quotas of East European countries, which, in effect, means Poland.The reactions of our industry would be the more violent now that it isknown that Polish exports of meat to this country are being maintained by a reduction in the living standards of the Polish people.Arguments against reducing cuota for Polish pigmeat7. Economic arguments .    Bacon is the largest item amongPolish exports to the United Kingdom and is valued at present at about 12 millions a year.   If imports from Poland were reduced, as proposed,by about  4-jr millions a year, exports of British goods to Poland wouldbe likely to fall by at least a similar amount.   A reduction in importsfrom Poland would be contrary to our present policy of developingtrade with Eastern Europe   and this policy assumes greater importanceat a time when our exports to the Common Market countries may decline.An  arbitrary decision to reduce the Polish cmota would also run counter to our support in the past few days for a declaration in favour of associating Poland with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.8. Political arguments.    A decision to reduce the Polish quotawould follow our opposition to the election of Poland to the security council, the repeated postponement of the Foreign Secretaryfsproposed visit to Poland and Polish fears about our commitments toour partners (particularly Denmark) in the E. F. T. A.    Such a decision-Z-CONFIDE i\i T S A L
CONFIDENTS.146coming at a time when Mr. Gomulka, the Prime Minister of Poland,is facing serious economic troubles at home and when he most needshelp from abroad, would seriously prejudice our policy of trying todevelop close and friendly relations to keep the Polish Governmentlooking to the West.    Furthermore, at the time when bacon was in short supply after the war we encouraged the Poles to develop theirsales to this country, and we have tried as far as possible to stabiliseour purchases from them at a level satisfactory to both countries.To reduce the cuota to 30,000 tons so abruptly would be regarded bythe Foles as a breach of faith.Free competition in the United Kingdom market9. It is arguable that the different sources of supply of pigmeatshould be permitted to compete in the United Kingdom market and bringdown prices for the British consumer.   This inevitable sudden fallin prices would, however, have serious repercussions on the confidencealready badly shaken of our own producers and would increase thecost of Exchequer support under the deficiency payments scheme.Sammary10. The consensus of view in the Economic Policy Committeewas that we could not continue to refuse to import pigmeat from Canada.Ministers were not, however, agreed on the proposal to reduce thecuotas of pigmeat from Poland.   The Minister of Agriculture made it clear that his proposals were complementary.B* H. A.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.13th November, 1959-3-
