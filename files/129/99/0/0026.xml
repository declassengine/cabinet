(TH&amp; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT)C. (59) 176 COPY NO.  (j^ j)1st December, 1959CABINETROYAL COMMISSION ON THE POLICEMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the Home department on 17th November, the Cabinet authorised me, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for Scotland, to indicate in the course of the Debate on 10th November on the Opposition Motion relatingto the case of Garratt v. Eastmond that the Government were considering thepossibility of a general enquiry into the police, which would cover relationsbetween the police and the public and the functions of the police authorities(C.C.(59) 5Sth Conclusions, Minute 3). I gave such an indication in the debate and the suggestion was generally welcomed.2.       Since then, in cons dtation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and secretary of State for Scotland, I have been giving consideration to the formand scope of the enquiry.   As to the form, I am sure that nothing less thana Royal Commission will do.   Puestions of the relationship between thepolice and the public and between the police and local and central governmentinvolve issues of supreme constitutional importance and fundamental principles of government.   As tip the scope of the enquiry, I attach astatement of the proposed terms of reference (Annex). .   These will permit the enauiry to cover the whole field of the relations between the police and local and  central government, Parliament and the public generally.They will also enable the Commission to consider the principles on whichpolice pay should be fixed.2.       The Cabinet left open the question whether the enquiry should cover pay and conditions of service.   I do not think that it would be desirable to have afurther enquiry on the details of conditions of service so soon after theCommittee on Police Conditions of Service, 19A9, under the chairmanship of Lord Oaksey, which went into them exhaustively.   On the other hand, Ido not think that we can avoid an enquiry into the principles on which basic pay should be settled.   The Police Federations of England and Wales and scotland are pressing for such an enquiry, and the question whether the status of the police as reflected in their basic pay is adequate to attract the type ofman needed to exercise properly the powers and responsibilities of theconstable could hardly be excluded from the purview of a Commissionenquiring into the manner in which police duties are discharged at the presenttime.   We could not have two enouiries running at the same time and Ithink the conclusion that the Commission must deal with the general basis of   remuneration is inescapable.4.       If my colleagues approve the proposal to recommend the appointmentof a Royal Commission with the terms of reference suggested, I shall discuss further with the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Scotland the choice of a chairman and the membership of the Commission.5.       The Secretary of State for Scotland is in agreement with these proposals.11. A B.Home Office, S. W.l.1st December, 1959 CONFIDENTIAL
