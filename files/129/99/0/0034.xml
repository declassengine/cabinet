C. (59) 184 Copy No.Ira 5911th December, 1959 &apos; &apos;; &apos;        &apos;1J ^CABINETEXTENSION OF THE RANGE OF TRUSTEE INVESTMENTMemorandum by the Home SecretarySince the early 1950&apos;s there has been mounting pressure from trustees, bothcharitable and private, to be allowed to extend the range of their investment beyondthe present authorised list which consists mainly of fixed interest Government,Dominion and Colonial and local authority stocks. By 1955, after considering theNathan Committee&apos;s Report on the Law and Practice relating to Charitable Trusts(1952 Cmd. 8710), Government had decided that legislation should be introducedgiving trustees of charitable trusts wider powers, including a limited investment in equities; but that a significant widening of the range for non-charitable trustswas not justified. In November of that year, however, Sir Eric Erringtonintroduced a Private Member&apos;s Bill for a very wide extension of the Trustee Listwhich was well supported on both sides of the House. The Bill was withdrawnon Second Reading after the Government had given an undertaking that the whole subject of the investment powers of trustees would be reviewed, and legislationintroduced. Subsequent Ministerial statements have created an expectation of anearly Government announcement.2. A working party of officials of the Departments concerned and of theBank of England has been examining the problem in all its aspects and the proposals outlined in the attached draft White Paper, were recently approved by the HomeAffairs Committee.3. The proposals represent a new approach to the problem of trusteeinvestment and provide that in accordance with the current practice of prudentinvestors, trustees may spread their investments between reputable and marketablefixed interest securities and equity stocks.  The essential provisions are:  (a) that trustees may invest any part of their trust funds in a wide range offixed interest securities and may invest up to one half of their funds inequities of certain United Kingdom companies and similar investments;(b) that safeguards designed to ensure marketability and spread of investmentare to be introduced;(c) that as an additional safeguard no investment (other than in small savings)may be made except on the advice of experienced people.The wider powers will extend to other holders of funds, including local authorities,who are authorised to invest in securities in which trustees are authorised to invest.4. Outside interests, including a few persons in the City, the Chancery judges and the Lord President of the Court of Session, have been consulted in confidence;they are content with the proposals.5. The length of time between the announcement of the proposals and thepassage of the legislation, and the normal operation of the market, is likely toensure that the switch into equities will be gradual, though some initial depressionof gilt-edged prices is to be expected.56249THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER^JTANMC^AJES^&apos;S^^EraMEOT-B Printed for the Cabinet:   December1959

In the past such stocks have beentrustee securities only,;, if ,.the?e,v.Governrn.ents ..haye., given special undertakingscomplying with the requirements of the Colonial Stock Acts. In future they will automatically be trustee investments. On the other hand, they will be in a lessexclusive and therefore less advantageous position. To mitigate this, it is^contemplated that legislation might provide a framework within whichtCommonwealth&apos;/Governments could continue at their option to give similar&apos;undertakings with regard to future issues as have in the past.been required bythe Colonial Stock Acts.7. Commonwealth Governments have been given an opportunity to comment on the proposals in accordance with a decision of the Home Affairs Committee.South Africa and Australia have both&apos; expressed misgivings about the probable effects on Commonwealth issues in London; South Africa have asked that their comments be taken into account, and Australia have put forward suggestionsdesigned to mitigate these effects. Both accept, however, that the matter is one for the United Kingdom Government, and it appears impracticable completely to reassure these Governments without seriously detracting from the value of theproposed trustee legislation.8. India have never felt able to give the undertakings necessary to securetrustee status. Whilst, therefore, they have welcomed the new scheme in general,-they have commented adversely on the proposals for an optional scheme on thegrounds that this would give a preferred status to the stocks of other commonwealth countries. They have asked that this aspect of the matter should receive full consideration in conjunction with the other Commonwealth countries. This isthe only adverse comment so far received on the proposals for an optional scheme,but comments from other Governments on this particular aspect are awaited. this need not, however, delay publication of the White Paper.9. The publication of a White Paper before the introduction of legislation will not only make widely known the Government^ intentions as soon as possible,but should also invoke discussion which will clarify some important points of detail. The broad outline of the scheme is, however, likely to meet with general approval.10. I recommend that approval be given for the immediate publication ofa White Paper in the terms of the draft attached, and for the introduction of early legislation.R. A.

introduction. A trustee may lawfully invest trust funds in his hands only in an investment which is authorised either expressly by the trust instrument or by statute (in England and Wales by the Trustee Act, 1925, in Scotland by theTrusts (Scotland) Act, 1921, as extended in each case by later statutes). as many trust instruments provide for the investment of the trust funds only &quot; insecurities for the time being authorised by law &quot;, many trustees can investonly in the statutory securities, commonly known as the Trustee List. Theseconsist for the most part of stocks issued by Her Majesty&apos;s Government in theUnited Kingdom, the Governments of Commonwealth countries and of theColonies, stocks guaranteed by Her Majesty&apos;s Government and stocks andmortgages issued by local authorities in the United Kingdom. Althoughmost of these securities, and indeed almost all the securities on the TrusteeList, represent obligations to pay a fixed rate of interest and to repay at parin accordance with the terms of the Prospectus, their market value is liableto vary in accordance with changes in the general level of interest rates.2. The Trustee List, first devised for the protection of trustees, was intended also to safeguard the interests of beneficiaries, whether entitled toincome or capital, by ensuring the preservation of capital and a steady yield of income. In the last twenty years the decline in the value of money inrelation to other forms of property has meant that the restriction of investmentalmost wholly to fixed interest securities has in many cases failed to ensurethe maintenance of the capital of the trust fund in real terms. The pattern of investment of trust funds is therefore not what an investor to-day wouldbe likely to adopt. This has led to the desire by many trustees to be allowedto invest trust funds in ordinary shares of industrial and commercial companies.3. For trustees of new private trusts it is now a common practice togive investment powers which either are unrestricted or extend considerablybeyond the Trustee List. For trustees of existing trusts wider powers areincreasingly being given by the High Court, by Her Majesty (acting on theadvice of the Privy Council) to chartered bodies and by Parliament itself in private Bills. In these circumstances the Government consider that there isno longer any justification for the continuance of the restrictions imposed bythe Trustee List on trustees of existing trusts, many of whom may find itdifficult or expensive to avail themselves of any of these means of enlargingtheir powers.Governments Proposals for Widening the Investment Powers oft Trustees4. The Government therefore propose to introduce legislation which would allow trustees, subject to safeguards, not only to invest any part of the trustfunds in a wide range of fixed-interest securities but also to invest up to halfof the trust funds in shares of certain companies. Under these proposals atrustee, subject to any provisions in the trust instrument authorising orprecluding a particular investment, would be authorised to invest trust funds in his hands in the following investments:  (a) small savings securities issued by the United Kingdom Government orthe Government of Northern Ireland (other than Premium Savings
f    197Bonds) of which the terms entitle the holder to encashment at pajkfrrabove at not more than six months&apos; notice; i f(/j) deposits in the Post Office Savings Bank, the Ordinary Department 01 aTrustee Savings Bank or in any Savings Bank certified by the treasury under Section 9 (3) of the Finance Act, 1956;and in the following, but subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 5below:  (c) in England and Wales and Northern Ireland, mortgages of freeholdproperty or of leasehold property of which the lease has not less than60 years to run, or in Scotland heritable securities;(d) fixed-interest securities issued in the United Kingdom by H.M.Government or any public authority, nationalised industry orundertaking or local authority in the United Kingdom or of which theprincipal and interest is guaranteed by H.M. Government;(e) fixed-interest securities issued in the United Kingdom by a central,regional or local government or public authority of any commonwealth country or United Kingdom dependent territory;(/) fixed-interest debentures (other than convertible debentures) issued by companies incorporated in the United Kingdom;(g) other securities which are at present authorised by law for investment by trustees;(h) deposits in the Special Investment Department of a Trustee savings bank;(/) fixed-interest sterling securities issued in London by the international bank for Reconstruction and Development;(/&apos;) convertible debentures or any stock or shares of any companyincorporated in the United Kingdom;(k) shares of building societies &quot; designated &quot; under rhe House purchase and Housing Act, 1959;(/) units of Unit Trusts authorised by the Board of Trade.5. The conditions mentioned in paragraph 4 are these:  (1) Not more than half of the trust fund (or of any fresh addition to the trust fund) valued at the time of investment may be invested in the securities described in sub-paragraphs 4 (j) to (/) above. In order,therefore, to exercise his power of investment in securities of that kinda trustee would, at the outset, divide his fund into two parts. one part, to be invested only in the investments described in sub-paragraphs (a) to (i) of paragraph 4, would be not less than one-halfof the trust fund valued at the time of the division; the other partcould be invested in any of the investments described above. the trustee would be authorised to invest money arising from suchinvestments, e.g., on the repayment of capital, only in accordance withthe conditions governing the investment of that part of the fund fromwhich the money arose. But any fresh addition to the trust funds from outside would be divided and invested as if it were a new fund.(2) Section 8 of the Trustee Act, 1925, and Section 30 of the Trusts(Scotland) Act, 1921 (which prescribe conditions as to the proportionof the value of property on which money may be lent, and the nature
of the advice on which a trustee may rely), will continue in force as-jpg regards investment in mortgages.H[3) No trustee, other than an institutional trust corporation (e.g., thePublic Trustee, Banks, &amp;c), may invest in securities described in sub-paragraphs (c/) to (/) of paragraph 4 except on written advice, from a competent professional financial adviser such as a stockbroker,accountant, or bank manager.(4) No funds may be invested in any stock (other than bonds or mortgagesof local authorities in the United Kingdom) or shares (other thanbuilding society shares) not quoted on a stock exchange in the UnitedKingdom or in any shares not fully paid up. (Provision would bemade to allow investment in new issues.)(5) No funds may be invested in any stock, shares or debentures of anycompany unless its total issued and paid up share capital is not lessthan  1 million and it has paid a dividend on all its issued share capital in each of the five years preceding the investment. (provision would be made to allow investment in a company formed by the merger of companies that complied with this latter condition.)(6) Not more than one-tenth of the fund or  250, whichever is the greater,may be invested in any one company, or Unit Trust, or in the shares of any one building society.Broad Effect of the proposals. The broad effect of these proposals is threefold. First, they ensurethat at least half of any trust moneys requiring investment (subject to anycontrary provisions in the trust instrument) will at the outset be invested in stocks or mortgages bearing a fixed rate of interest. In this respect theproposals conform with the principles of the present Trustee List. Thereare a few securities in the List which are not fixed-interest securities, e.g.,the stocks of statutory water companies, and deposits in building societiesdesignated under the House Purchase and Housing Act, 1959; it is proposedthat trustees should be able to invest in these on the same footing as infixed-interest securities, and they will therefore still be able to invest thewhole of the trust funds in their hands, subject to certain conditions, in anysecurities on the present Trustee List. Furthermore, in fulfilment of theintention announced in Parliament in July, 1955, it is proposed to includeamong the fixed-interest securities in which trustees may invest the fixed-interest sterling securities of the International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment.Second, they allow trustees wide scope for investing up to half of the trust fund in high class company shares and thereby bring investment bytrustees into line with the practice being increasingly adopted by investorsand endorsed by the High Court and by Parliament.Third, they require investments in all but small savings to be made only upon advice. In introducing this requirement the Government recognise thatit is important not only that trustees should select sound investments butalso that they should have the benefit of skilled advice in their purchases.Even though he may choose a stock of the highest quality it is still possiblefor a trustee to harm his beneficiaries by purchasing, for example, a stockwith a redemption date inappropriate for the purpose of the trust.   It has
i 9 Snot however been thought necessary to apply this condition to cergsinSavings Bank deposits and small savings securities which can be heldf jyin limited amounts, and can be cashed at short notice without loss.Proposals only Permissive7. The proposals are only permissive and will not impose any obliga-tion on trustees to alter the existing investments of trust funds, nor will theylimit any wider powers of investment that might be exercisable by trustees.They will not affect the existing power of the Court in England to extend the range of investment for particular trusts.Extension of Powers to Other Holders of Funds8. The proposals will extend the investment powers not only of trusteesexpressly appointed by a trust instrument, but also of other holders of funds,including local authorities, who are authorised to invest in securities in whichtrustees are authorised to invest.Consequential Amendment of the Colonial Stock Acts9. The proposals will require some amendment of the Colonial StockActs, which have for over half a century provided the framework withinwhich Colonial and Commonwealth Governments have issued stock on theLondon market. As regards existing stocks, the obligations assumed tostockholders under the previous arrangements are not affected by the present proposals. As regards future stock issues, it is contemplated that, subjectto consultation with the other Governments concerned, arrangements willbe made for those who wish to do so to assume obligations towards stock-holders similar to those assumed under the Colonial Stock Acts. The powersof trustees to invest in Colonial and Commonwealth stocks will, however,be no longer confined to stocks in respect of which such obligations havebeen assumed.Printed in England and published by her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office56213  Wt. 1059/1986  K     12/59  F.O.P.
