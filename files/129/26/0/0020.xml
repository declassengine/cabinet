S  DOCUMENT  IS   THE PROPERTY OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1948CONFIDENTIAL Copy no cp. (48) 11022nd April, 1948CABINETSIXTH SESSION OF THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCILOF THE UNITED NATIONSoMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate, for the information of my colleagues, a report on the SixthSession of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. The UnitedKingdom Delegation was led by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,22nd April, 1948ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COUNCIL OF THE UNITED NATIONSSIXTH session the Sixth Session of the Economic and Social Council closed on 11th March.2. The length of the session (5 weeks and 4 days) was accounted for partly by a long agenda of 37 items and partly by the Slav policy of extending the&quot; cold war &quot; into the councils deliberations. Mr. Arutiunian, who led forthe U.S.S.R. instead of Mr. Morosov, is a formidable opponent, clever and witha close knowledge of events at and since San Francisco. The parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who was the United kingdom delegate, and Mr. Willard Thorpe (United States) periodically hit out with vigourbut were not prepared to wreck the work of the Council, whereas the Slavs wereprepared to protract a debate to any length in order to have the last word.3. The work of the session was mainly concerned with economic matters,whereas at the next session the emphasis will be on social questions. The agendaincluded the reports of the Specialised Agencies, the World Economic Survey,the Food Shortage, Reports of the Regional Commissions, problems of Co-ordina-tion, the question of the Yugoslav Gold reserves in the United States, and, conse-quently, the general competence of the Council in dealing with disputes and inmaking recommendations to individual member States.4. An interesting development was that, on colonial issues, the Slavs seemedho longer able to get support from countries such as China, Chile, Venezuela, andLebanon, who used to be prepared to vote with them on resolutions and amend-ments intended to. embarrass the colonial Powers.5.   There follow some notes on some of the salient features of the session : World Economic SurveyA significant point in the development of the CounciFs work was the debate on the world economic survey submitted by the Secretariat as the first of a regularseries.   The survey showed some gaps and failings as was perhaps natural for35254
the initial survey, but it was on the whole a promising document, and the debatehad quality and was wide in range. Mr. Mayhew made a comprehensive state-ment on British post-war problems and progress. The Soviet delegate delivereda long but uninf ormative encomium on Soviet economic development, interspersedwith attacks on other countries, and including the remarkable assertion that britain &quot; was attempting to solve her unemployment problems by rearming.&quot; Inreply Mr. Mayhew drew attention to the lack of information in United Nationspublications about conditions in Soviet Russia, and drew the conclusions that theSoviet Government feared comparison with other countries, and had no right to criticise their efforts. No specific action resulted from the debate, which wasonly a first step towards fulfilment of the CounciFs role of studying andcommenting on the world economic scene, but as such it was not without promise.World Food Crisis6. The survey showed that food shortage was the world&apos;s greatest singleeconomic disability, and on the basis of a paper from the Food and AgriculturalOrganisation the Council took its first substantial step in the field of co-ordinationof the activities of the Specialised Agencies in a resolution asking governments and the various Agencies concerned to increase their efforts, and the Agenciesto report back to the Council on the elimination of bottlenecks within theirrespective spheres which affected food supply.Regional Economic Commissions7. The Council formally established an Economic Commission for latin america with terms of reference preserving the emphasis on the temporarycharacter of Regional Commissions and the restriction of their terms of reference.An Ad Hoc Committee was set up to consider the need for an Economic Corn-mission in the Middle East. A report from the Economic Commission for asia and the Far East caused little controversy and the Council took a useful step in approving a study of measures for flood control in the areas of the great riversof the Far East. The Economic Commission for Europe had not met in full sessionsince the last session of the Council, but an interim report from the ExecutiveSecretary showed the practical work done by the Commission^ subordinate bodies.Relief for Children8. Reports from the International Children&apos;s Emergency Fund and theUnited Nations Appeal for Children met with general acceptance. The Fund isnow supplying relief to four million mothers and children in twelve european countries, and Far Eastern programmes are being developed. National appealsunder the United Nations Appeal for Children are established in twenty-onecountries.Other Social Items9. A report from the Social Commission caused considerable discussion andwas.the occasion of a sharp rejoinder by the United Kingdom delegate to Sovietaccusations that Great Britain deliberately depressed the standard of living in her colonies for purposes of exploitation. Mr. Mayhew&apos;s speech, coming earlyin the session, set the Russians on the defensive by pointing out that it was upto them, before attacking others, to lift the veil of secrecy from conditions in eastern Europe and prove, if they could, that Russia&apos;s political and economicimperialism was not, as it appeared to the rest of the world, a grave threat tothe standard of living of workers and peasants in those countries. Thisundoubtedly had a restraining effect on Russian tactics for the remainder of theCouncil.Reports from the Narcotics Commission and Permanent Central OpiumBoard showed that international control of drugs, now formally under united nations supervision, had virtually regained its pre-war efficiency. A programmedealing with Child Welfare, which is a subject which does not fall specificallywithin the competence of any existing Agency, was approved for action by theSocial Commission. An A d Hoc Committee to re-draft a Convention on Genocidewas set up in spite of United Kingdom doubts of the worth of a convention ona crime already effectively punishable under international law. The question of equal pay for equal work for men and women was referred to the InternationalLabour Organisation in a resolution on which the United Kingdom was forcedto abstain since it demanded, prior to consideration by the Organisation, imme-diate action by Governments to implement a principle which His Majesty&apos;s
Government has accepted but cannot under present circumstances afford to putinto effect.The Reports of the Statistical and Population Commissions were satisfactory and did not lead to controversy.Competence of the Council in Economic Disputes10. A Yugoslav demand that the United States should release the gold reserves of the former Yugoslav Government precipitated a long debate on thewhole question of the Council&apos;s competence under the Charter to deal withbilateral disputes. The Council decided that this particular question did not fall within its competence since it was unable to take cognisance of the juridicalissues involved, but avoided any general ruling binding itself for the future.Co-ordination11. The debates on this subject ended with a set of resolutions dealing inconsiderable detail with the nature of reports required from Specialised agencies and Commissions. The United Kingdom felt that the Council was trying to take into its own hands too much of the detailed work which should more properlybelong to the Secretary-General&apos;s Co-ordination Committee, and the UnitedKingdom delegate abstained on certain of the Resolutions. A proposal for an interim committee of Council Members to deal with matters concerning co-ordina-tion was defeated at the instance of the United Kingdom. The resolutions passedincluded a useful provision requesting Commissions of the Council to establishclear priorities in their reports.Financial and Administrative Questions12. The United Kingdom took the lead in urging economies on the Counciland at the end of the session made suggestions for ways of keeping the Councilbetter informed about the financial implications of its actions and to enable it,with these implications in mind, to assign priorities to its proposals. the suggestions met with a gratifying interest and the Secretary-General has under-taken to keep the Council in future more continuously in touch with over-allfinancial implications of its work, while the matter of priorities will be discussed in more detail at the next session.Reports of the Specialised A gencies13. The Council examined for the first time reports of the specialised agencies and with suitable restraint refrained from making any recommenda-tions on this occasion and contented itself with transmitting to the Agencies the record of the debate of some length which took place in the Council followingstatements by the representatives of the Specialised Agencies.Palestine Elections to the Joint Economic Board14. In accord with the recommendation of the Palestine Commission, themajority of the Council expected to postpone this item to the next session. TheSlavs used the debate to cast doubt on the United States support of partition andargued that the Council had to take action now under the Assembly resolution.In the result the Council called on Governments for nominations by 15th June.A paper by the World Jewish Congress asking for a three-man committee ofenquiry to investigate the killing of Jews in the Middle East, which had beensent to the Council without recommendation by the Council Committee on Non-Governmental Organisations, was referred back to that committee for further study and any recommendations it considered useful.Personnel15. The new President, Mr. Malik of Lebanon, conducted a difficult sessionwith dignity and clarity. He fell, however, into the error of interpreting therules of procedure with varying degrees of firmness at different times, and therebyexposed himself to sharp Soviet charges of partiality, although any laxness hehad shown had been in their favour and had resulted from the Slavs&apos; practice,particularly towards the end of the session, of bombarding him with points of order and sudden amendments. In the result his Presidency was on the wholeonly moderate, though we would expect it to be good at the next session after his experience this time.
The United States had a strong delegation, and the French had a delegation which outnumbered ours. Their strength, however, was political and legal andwe were occasionally troubled by their lack of sense of financial responsibility(e.g., their proposal to reinstitute verbatim records).The Commonwealth delegations were, as usual, sound and helpful, and Stolkof Venezuela and Santa Cruz of Chile made unexpectedly impressive contributionson a number of matters. The Netherlands had a large delegation but againsuffered from lack of continuity in their representation and as a delegation didnot make much impact. The Byelorussian (Mr. Kaminsky) was a surprisinglyuseful Vice-President and Chairman of Committee, though as a delegate he wasunimpressive. The Polish delegation, led by Lange and Katz-Suchy, was ofimpressive ability, but hardly ever deviated from the Soviet line.The work of the Secretariat of the Council itself continued to be good,conducted largely by Yates and Owen.The Neat Session16. The President pointed out that the next session, which would take placeon 19th July, would be heavier than the present long session and would requireaction on several social matters of the first importance (The Bill of Rights,Freedom of Information) for submission to the Assembly as well as on the task of co-ordinating for the first time the work programmes of the specialised agencies. He warned the Council that it must observe the utmost economy of effort if it was to complete its task in the five weeks allotted.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,April 1948.
