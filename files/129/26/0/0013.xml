*RCUlATED....*3[/*f....&apos;...Al...l..,:.*.THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OP   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1948SECRET Copy No.   3CP. (48) 103Sth April, 1948CABINETSTRIKE SITUATION IN BURMAMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues a memorandum on thestrike situation in Burma.E. B.Foreign Of/ice, S. W. 1,8th April, 1948.memorandum in Burma there are two Communist Parties the official Burmese CommunistParty and an extreme group known generally as the &apos;.&apos; Communist Party(Burma),&quot; who have been outlawed since January 1947 for advocating immediaterevolution. The official Communist Party has recently come out into the open andhas instigated a series of strikes, chiefly in the British-controlled companies, whichhave threatened to paralyse Rangoon. The Burmese Government, after anattempt, in deference to their own Left-wing, to come to terms with them, havetaken action to suppress the strikes and to arrest the official Communist party leaders.   The people as a whole seem relieved and the situation is quiet.2. The first strike began in the storage plant of the Burma Oil Company(British) on 9th March, ostensibly over the proposed dismissal of one employee.But the strikers refused to return when the employee was reinstated, and strikesspread to other British concerns and threatened to become general. Picketing of petrol stations in Rangoon and violent intimidation of non-strikers followed.On 10th March, Burmese police arrested the leaders of the extreme Communistgroup who had been in hiding in Rangoon. From them and from other sourcesthey obtained evidence that the official Communist Party planned a concertedseries of strikes and disturbances in Rangoon and in the interior.3. There was division of opinion in the parties supporting the Government,,some of whom incidentally urged them to declare the nationalisation of the BurmaOil Company before taking any action against the strikers.4. At the request of his principal supporters, the Prime Minister invited the official Communist Party leaders to discuss the question with the socialists and it was only after continued prevarication by the Communists that the Gov-ernment, on 28th March, declared that there was clear evidence that they intendedto seize power by violence and ordered the arrest of the party leaders.5. The immediate effect of these measures in Rangoon is reported by HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador to be satisfactory. Public opinion appears to be on theGovernments side and all strikers had returned to work by 1st April. But thereis obvious cause for anxiety. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador reports that the Govern-ment confess that Communist propaganda has gone much deeper than theyimagined and that the army and police are not immune. Moreover, most of the35194
influential leaders of the official Communist Party have evaded arrest, and dis-turbances in areas in Central Burma where communism is strong must be regardedas very probable.6. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador reports that a ban on the official CommunistParty has been prepared, but that it is being held up until attempts have beenmade to arrest the leaders in various parts of Burma.7. Violent opposition to the Government is a new policy for the officialCommunist Party, which it is believed has no direct contacts with Russia (theSoviet Embassy is not yet established in Rangoon). There is evidence to suggestthat the change has been brought about as a result of recent contact with theIndian Communist Party, which may of course have relayed instructions from moscow. The strikes began a few days after the return of the principal BurmeseCommunists from the annual Indian Communist Party conference at Calcutta.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,8th April, 1948.
