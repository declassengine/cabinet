THIS  DOCUMENT IS   THE PROPERTY OF   HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1948CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.CP. (48) 1183rd May, 1948GABINETGERMAN SECTION, FOREIGN office memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on the functions,organisation and establishment of the German Section of the Foreign Office, whichhas been prepared at my request by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.I am in general agreement with the views expressed by Lord Pakenham.My colleagues will note that some parts of the organisation need much more detailed scrutiny for which provision is made in the report (paragraphs 27 and28). The conclusions are summarised in paragraphs 37 to 41; they allow for areduction of 368 in the staff of the German Section, the strength of which will fallfrom the present figure of 1758 to 1390 on 1st April, 1949. This represents areduction of 21 per cent., as compared with a reduction of 31 per cent, in thestaff of the Control Commission over the same period.E B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,3rd May, 1948.Secretary of StateFUNCTIONS, ORGANISATION AND ESTABLISHMENT OF THEGERMAN SECTION OF THE FOREIGN OFFICEYou asked me to carry out, concurrently with my investigation into thestaff of the Control Commission, a similar enquiry into the German Section of theForeign Office. I am now in a position to report the results of it to you. Theyare incomplete, since, for reasons to which I refer below, I have thought itnecessary to arrange for a detailed and technical survey to be made of a con-siderable part of the Section which may well take two or three months to complete;but as a result of my own investigation I can present you with a general surveywhich is not, I think, likely to be seriously modified by the findings of this moretechnical enquiry. I am therefore presenting this Report with an Appendix*showing the organisation of the departments and their present strength.2. The German Section, which embodies the former Control Office for germany and Austria, remains technically, so far as staff is concerned, a home civil Service Department within the Foreign Office. There are a few members ofthe Foreign Service in it, and they are mainly in higher posts. It includes aconsiderable proportion of temporary Civil Servants, which is understandable inview of the circumstances in which it had to be organised.3.   The staff of the German Section can be divided into : (a) The Functional Departments.(b) The Administrative Departments.(c) The staff providing Common Services (communications, travel services,typists, messengers, &amp;c).The numbers given for the strengths of the Departments are as at 1st April,1948.* Not printed.35308 B
4. The German Section is in a process of continuous development, and anumber of changes have taken place during the time I have been conducting myenquiry. Some of these are noted in this report. Broadly the position is that the functional departments are gradually but steadily being contracted, but someof the administrative departments, especially on the Personnel and Accounts sides,are still struggling to get their work straightened out and organised on a footingwhich will provide the efficient personnel administration that it is the right ofthe staff at home and overseas to receive, and the proper accounting machinerythat Parliament expects. In both respects the problems created by the circum-stances in which the Commissions work have been severe, and they are not yetentirely solved. The number of staff engaged on the Common Services is largelydictated by the size of the rest of the Office.A. The Functional Departments5.   These fall into two broad groups.(a) Political and  Governmental Affairs  (Superintending  Under-Secretary Sir I. Kirkpatrick)(i) German Political Department    ...      ...      .... ...      11(ii) German   Internal   Department   (formerly   GermanGeneral Department)    ...      ...      ...      ... ...      14(iii) Refugee Department        ...      ...      ...      ... ...        8(iv) German Education Department....... 27P.W. Division      ...      ............ 80Information Services Directorate...      ...      ... 40     147Total 180(b) Economic   and   Financial  Affairs   (Superintending   Under-Secretaries Mr. R. B. Stevens and Sir C. Jones)(i) German Supply Department     ...      ...      ....... 43(ii) German Industry Department (including statistics and information room)        ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 31(iii) German Trade Department      ...      ...      ...      ... 10(iv) German General Economic Department        ...      ... 16(v) German Finance Department    ...      ...      ...      ... 21(vi) German   Section   Accounts   Department   (excludingPay Section)      ..................     110Total 2316. This is a formidable array of departments, but I think that it isnecessary to bear in mind the fact that up to the present time our relationship to Germany has been of an unprecedented character and the absence of a GermanGovernment, with its own external representation and a negotiable currency,has thrown a special burden of work on us, not only in Germany but also inLondon. The normal task of a Foreign Office department dealing with a foreign country that of advising you on political developments within it and on ourrelations with it /  is only a small part of our present work in connection withGermany.   In addition we have tasks arising from the facts that: (a) we have to plan the future government of the country, in conjunctionwith our Allies;(b) we have to supervise the internal administration of our Zone, for whichwe are finally responsible to Parliament;(c) we have to discharge certain functions (e.g., the purchase and shipping of imports, the control of entry into Germany) which would normally be undertaken by German Government agencies; and(d) we have, as a matter of long-term policy, to do everything possible toassist the German people to achieve the reform of their educational system which will be necessary if they are to become a democratic,peace-loving people, and, as a matter of immediate importance, toensure that they are adequately informed about world affairs and inparticular, about events and developments in this country.7. You will observe how one or more of these factors applies to all the functional departments. The two latter are more important than the first twoso far as the creation of work, and therefore the need for staff, are concerned.
I.^Political and Governmental Affairs(i) German Political Department 118. This department deals with current political affairs in Germany(including intelligence), the political future of the country (including its govern-ment and administration) and our relationship with our Allies and other powers in so far as they are concerned with German affairs. It is not a large department and no diminution of its work or staff can be foreseen.(ii) German Internal Department 149. This department deals mainly with the internal administrative affairs of the British Zone in so far as they are neither political nor economic. thus it is responsible for local government, public health matters, post and telegraphs,denazification, the German police, the trade unions and labour relations generally.The last examples show that the line between this department and the GermanPolitical Department is sometimes not easy to draw, and the relations between these two departments must be very close. The staff dealing with these mattersis small.10. While it was the German General Department it had certain other functions such as the despatch and receipt of telegrams to and from Germanyand Austria, the handling of Parliamentary and other papers and the provisionof statistics. The handling of telegrams has now been transferred to the GermanSection Establishment and Organisation Department, and statistics to german industry Department, while the other miscellaneous functions are being cut downand re-distributed. Some should be taken over by the appropriate Foreign Officedepartments as soon as possible. I shall refer again, under the heading of common services, to this redistribution of functions, which should lead to substantial economies in staff.(iii) Refugee department?,tment-*$11. The small staff in the Refugee Department (which belongs to the GermanSection) deals mainly with the displaced persons in Germany and Austria, butalso deals with-world refugee problems generally.(iv) German Education Department 27P.W. Division-80Information Services Directorate 40 : Total 14712. This department is responsible both for advice on matters of policy andfor giving as much help as can be given from this country to the Education Advisorand his staff in Germany. This work might be defined as the mustering and deployment of the educational resources of this country to assist in the re-education of the British Zone. The department also exercises a general supervision overthe Prisoners of War organisation in this country and the Information ServicesDirectorate. In view of the importance of its tasks, I would not recommendany rapid decrease in the main Education Department, but I expect to see asmall reduction in its staff by April 1949.13. The P.W. Division, whose staff now numbers eighty including thestaff of Wilton Park, is concerned with the re-education of German prisoners in this country and the Middle East, and will disappear this year when theyhave been repatriated. The Wilton Park Training Centre will thereafter bereduced in size and will deal only with civilians brought over from Germany.There will be little change in the total size of the British civilian staff, which now numbers twenty-three, since it will then have to perform administrative and clerical work which is now clone by the Army and by prisoners, but thenumber of men in the higher grades will be reduced. On present plans, the Centrewill continue until 1st April, 1949; its future after that is uncertain. I am givingthe matter close personal attention.14. Consideration is also being given to the possibility of continuing theP.W. camp at Trumpington as a civilian agricultural camp, to which about 500young Germans between the ages of 21 and 27 would be brought over from the&quot;British Zone each year to spend six to nine months in this country. Mr. Birley,the Education Advisor to the Control Commission for Germany, has been speciallyimpressed by the work done in this camp and looks upon it as a means of offering35308 b 2
II. Economic and Financial Affairs18. The work of the. first four of these departments, those concerned witheconomic affairs, is in certain respects closely connected. While the volume ofwork in some directions, particularly those relating to day-to-day control inGermany, is tending to fall off, it is increasing in certain other directions,particularly as a result of increased German participation in international economic affairs. As a result of these changes on emphasis, it should be possibleto effect certain measures of re-organisation and even amalgamation during thecoming year. A reduction of 20 per cent, in the staff of the department is hoped for but how far this can be achieved must depend on the volume of work which,for the reasons given above, is difficult to foresee with certainty.(i) German Supply Department 4319. This Department is responsible for the procurement and shipment toGermany of the goods imported and paid for by the British Government, and the shipment of cereals, &amp;c, bought by the United States Government. It also studiesthe German food situation and advises on import policy. In addition, it has some concern, as agent of the Joint Export-Import Agency, with the purchase and shipment of imports paid for from the proceeds of exports, as well as withfoodstuff gift schemes and the disposal within Germany of surplus stores. the decrease in our responsibility for imports and the increase in the share of the work being done by Anglo-American and German agencies in Germany should enable us to reduce the staff of this Department by about 20 per cent, within the nextyear.(ii) German Industry Department 3120. This Department advises on the manner in which our industrial policyin Germany should be regulated in view of our general policy and internationalrelationships. It acts as a connecting link between the Control Commission andother Departments here with a direct interest in German industry and transport.The department is responsible for seeing that United Kingdom interests are noteducational opportunities to the kind of young German working men who mightbe expected to give a democratic lead in the Works&apos; Councils and elsewhere. ABritish staff of about eight persons would be needed, but it is intended to makethe camp so far as possible financially self-supporting. At present a staff of about this number is supplied by the Army.15. From the point of view of British Foreign Office personnel, therefore,the present figure of eighty engaged on Prisoner of War work will be reduced from 1st April, 1949, to a figure not more than thirty even if both Trumpingtonand Wilton Park are continued thereafter. To put the matter in this way,however, considerably understates the saving in man-power, as at present bothcamps are administered by the Army.16. The Information Services Directorate has two main tasks. In the firstplace it acts as the London Public Relations organisation of the two commissions and advises on press and radio policy in Germany (in so far as this is under british control). In the second place it supplies the German press and wireless services, which have little representation of their own in London, with foreignnews and with feature material on Great Britain. The Directorate will in futurework in very much closer contact with the News and Information departments of the Foreign Office. This step will ensure that our information policy inGermany is integrated with that in other countries and will make greater resourcesboth of staff and publicity material available for Germany. It will, of course,be necessary to ensure that the special needs of Germany are met and the specialnature of our responsibilities are borne in mind.17. As this closer working with the corresponding departments of theForeign Office develops some economy in man-power will be achieved. A muchgreater economy will result when German newspapers are able to maintain theirown correspondents in London, and it is no longer necessary to provide themwith news and features on international affairs. A provisional reduction of12^ per cent, in the strength of the Directorate during the next twelve months has been allowed for, but I feel that more can be done in this direction and Iam having the matter re-examined in conjunction with Mr. C. F. A. Warner.
overlooked in the export of timber and steel scrap from Germany. The Head ofthis department has now been made responsible for the Statistics Section of theOffice, with a staff of 11, of which the main, though not the whole, concern iseconomic statistics. This section was formerly attached to the German GeneralDepartment, and there was a certain amount of overlapping between the two departments; the elimination of this should result in some saving of staff. Thework of the department as a whole is likely to decrease in so fa,r as it concernsday-to-day questions relating to German industry, but may well increase as aresult of the need for co-ordination between German industrial planning andthe objectives of the European Recovery Programme. On balance therefore thework of the department is not likely to decrease much within the next year.(iii) German Trade Department 1021. This Department is responsible for matters affecting bizonal exportpolicy, foreign and inter-zonal trade and, in a general sense, the foreign economic relations of the Combined Zone, including European Recovery Programme matters,as well as the economic aspects of bizonal and trizonal fusion. For reasons already given I can foresee no decrease in its work during the coming year.(iv) German General Economic Department 1622. This Department deals with quadripartite matters (e.g., the level ofindustry and reparations) and certain miscellaneous questions such as scientific research. At the present time the volume of work in this field is very heavy and is likely to remain so until all outstanding questions with regard to reparations and the level of industry plan are finally settled at least as betweenthe three Western Powers. Eventually, however, it may be possible to merge thisdepartment with the Trade and Industry Departments but it is not possible atpresent to say with any certainty when this merger will take place, though i hope it will be within the next twelve months.(v) German Finance Department 2123. This Department is concerned with the internal finances of Germany,with our financial policy towards Germany, and with the control of all the fundsvoted to the German Section by Parliament except those directly related to pay and establishments. The most important aspect of Germany&apos;s internal financeat the moment is currency reform, and the widespread financial adjustments whichare closely linked with it. Much will remain to be done in this field even afterthe actual currency conversion takes place. Germany&apos;s foreign exchange positionand the absence of banking relations with other countries make it necessary to operate special schemes for the remittance of money and the provision of funds to visitors. The department has also to advise on the settlement of overseas claims and debts, and the protection of the property of foreign owners. Our financial policy towards Germany involves determining and accounting for the cost ofGermany to the British taxpayer, in consultation with the Treasury; a closesupervision is exercised over the general operation of the Joint Export-ImportAgency, and over the financing of particular import and export contracts. Thedepartments third major responsibility is the co-ordination of the German SectionEstimates, and the detailed administration of those sub-heads of the Vote which do not fall within the scope of the Establishment and Personnel Departments.I do not expect any diminution of these tasks during the current year. Even thesuccessful achievement of currency reform will carry in its train compensatingtasks; it will, for example, then be necessary to attempt a much closer control ofexpenditure on internal costs of occupation by our own forces, and, at quadri-partite level, by the other Occupying Powers, if an intolerable burden on theGerman economy is to be avoided.(vi) German Section Accounts Department (excluding Pay Section) 11024. This department maintains detailed records of expenditure and receiptsunder the German Section Vote. It is responsible for effecting payments thatfall due for supplies to Germany and for completing the collection of payments due for exports from the British Zone during the period before the fusion&quot; of theBritish and American Zones. The department is also concerned with the pro-vision of funds to business men and other persons visiting or residing in ourzone of Germany. Its organisation and staffing are at present under review by an experienced ex-civil servant (Mr. J. A. Williams, a former Director of Accountsin the Ministry of Supply).35308 B 3
B. The Administrative Departments(Superintending Under-Secretaries-Mr. G. D. Kirwan and Sir C. Jones)25.   These are : (i) German Section Establishment and Organisation Department(including   the   Organisational   Advisor   and   MilitaryBranch)......................&quot;. 109(ii) Control Service Establishment and Organisation Department 44(iii) Control Service Personnel Department       ...       ...      ... 229(iv) Pay Section of the Accounts Department    ...      ...      ... 245(v) Control Service Recruiting Department     ...      ...       ... 58Total     .....................&apos; 68526. The Establishment Departments, with the Pay Section of AccountsDepartment, account for nearly 40 per cent, of the total staff of the GermanSection. They are engaged in performing services for the Control Commissionsas well as for the German Section itself. Their functions include recruiting staff,paying and administering them while in service, and making the necessary arrangements for their discharge when they resign or become redundant.27. Together with the staff engaged in performing the Common Servicesnecessary for the running of the Section (communications, travel services, registry,typing and other services shown below) the Establishment Departments amountto 1,075 out of a total of 1,758. I have not made any exhaustive survey of themsince this is a technical task. I felt it was necessary to have outside help andI have therefore arranged with Sir Edward Bridges for the loan of an Organisa-tion and Methods man from the Inland Revenue, to be joined with our ownOrganisational Advisor in carrying out this enquiry.28. Some progress has been made with this enquiry but the field is a wideone. The technical survey may well be able to propose a number of improvements in organisation, but my own investigations have not suggested that it would beable to effect any striking reduction other than those already foreseen. I am sure it is essential that these Administrative Departments should be sufficientlywell staffed to be able to give an efficient service to the Commissions and to theGerman Section, since the morale of the staff is dependent on efficient administra-tion. Although the enquiry to which I referred will provide fuller information think that I should let you have at least my provisional views.(i) German Section Establishment and Organisation Department 10929. This department deals with the administration of the London Office and staff. Its strength depends, of course, on the size of the German Section as awhole, and it will be reduced by about 25 per cent, during the next twelve months.(ii) Control Service Establishment and Organisation Department 4430. The determination of the general terms and conditions of service of the commissions is the responsibility of this department. As these terms of service are to be reviewed and re-determined during the coming year little reduction is likely in its strength. It also deals with the establishments of the commissions and with the provision of vehicles, stores, stationery and so on.(iii) Control Service Personnel Department 22931. This department undertakes the detailed administration of the membersof the Commissions and is responsible for the application to individual cases ofthe general conditions of service determined by the Control Service establishment and Organisation Department. It has, in the past, been too weak to keep its work up to date and has had to be strengthened, but when its arrears have been cleared away it may be possible to dispense with some 15 per cent, of its staffby 1st April, 1949, in view of the reduction in the staff of the Control commission for Germany. This process of reduction itself creates a great deal of administra-tive work in London and for this reason no more rapid decline in the strengthof the Control Service Personnel Department can be expected.
(iv) Pay Section of the Accounts Department 24532. This Section is responsible for the payment of both the members ofthe Control Service and of the German Section. It too has not been strong enough in the past to give an efficient service and it was necessary to increase its numbers.  Much early reduction is unlikely.(v) Control Service Recruiting Department -5833. At one time this Department was 500 strong, but since few new recruitsare now needed its work is very much diminished and will diminish furtheralthough the selection of recruits is now made with greater care and deliberation.The department is destined to be merged with the Control Service PersonnelDepartment and by April 1949 the staff engaged on this work should not numbermore than about twenty.C. The Common Services(i) Registries     ...      ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 162(ii) Typing Staff.................. 172(iii) Messengers and Cleaners   ...      ...      ...      ... 136(iv) Travel Services       ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 96(v) Message Control     ...      ...      ...      ...      ... 6963534. The Common Services of the German Section include Registries, Typingand Messengers and are not from the staffing point of view, out of scale withthose of the main Foreign Office or other Government Departments. these services are being constantly reviewed and some of them are being examined inthe technical enquiry I referred to above. I am hoping to see a reduction ofabout 100 in the staff performing these services.35. Travel services are looked after by German Travel Department. Theexistence of this Department is necessary at present for two reasons : first, becausetravel into and out of Germany has to be controlled in accordance with tripartiteagreements; and, second, because no adequate commercial machinery exists tomake the actual travel arrangements. As the restrictions are lightened the amountof travel will increase and with it the administrative work involved. Until this can be passed over to commercial agencies no substantial reduction in the depart-ment will be possible; this is being pursued, but it is too soon to say when therewill be any change which will materially affect the work of the department. Thereis seasonal variation in the work it increases in summer and any estimate of future staff requirements can therefore only be provisional, but I hope that thepresent strength of 96 will be reduced to 70 during the coming year.36. I must also mention Message Control, which is responsible for the telegrams to and from Germany and Austria and their distribution. It has been temporarily a part of the German General Department, but has now been trans-ferred to the German Section Establishment and Organisation Department. the aim is eventually to merge it in Communications Department and to reduce itsnumbers to about 60.Conclusion37. It may be convenient if I state my conclusions as regards both organisa-tion and numbers.  In the former field the main changes I foresee are : (a) The disappearance of the P.W. Division and the amalgamation of the recruiting Department and probably the General Economic Depart-ment with other Departments.(b) A closer relationship between the Information Services Directorate andthe News and Information Departments of the Foreign Office, andan eventual merger of Message Control and CommunicationsDepartment.I may add that the Legal Advisor to the Foreign Office has, with a smalladdition to his staff, already taken over the responsibility of affording legal advice to the German Section.
s38. The following table shows the decrease of staff which has taken place or which I anticipate will take place up to 1st April, 1949.

I thus estimate that the staff of the German Section will decrease in numbers from 1,758 to 1,390 on 1st April, 1949. This represents a fall of about21 per cent.; during the same period the decrease in staff of the Control commission for Germany is expected to amount to 31 per cent.40. The rate of decrease for the German Section is considerably smaller than that for the Control Commission for Germany, but the two staffs are notmathematically related. On the functional side, the size of the German Sectiondepends on the policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government towards Germany, andthe repercussions of world policy, as well as the creation of a responsibleGerman Government. On the administrative side, the process of terminating the appointment of the Control Commission for Germany staff who have resignedor been declared redundant in itself increases the amount of work to be doneby the Establishment and Accounts Departments in London. Since these depart-ments have not in the past been strong enough to discharge their functions ina fully satisfactory manner, their numbers cannot now fall as rapidly as thoseof the Commissions. Finally, there can in London be no handing over of responsi-bilities to German authorities and no recruiting of Germans to replace british staff.41. The fact that this year will be a year of transition in itself increases the work of the German Section. The supervision of changes in the structure of the Control Service and the transfer of responsibilities to the Germans willtemporarily add to its tasks. I should have liked to give you a forecast of thedevelopment of the German Section in the year or two following April 1949.Further substantial reductions should take place, but there is bound to be considerable delay between any particular reduction in the staff abroad and a
corresponding reduction of the staff in London. A rapid rate of reduction ofstaff, of the kind I have indicated in ray report on the Control Commission, is bound to increase the burden on the staff at home at first. However, I feel thatthe matter should be looked at again after the establishment of a provisionalgovernment in Germany when it will be possible to outline the nature of theorganisation we shall require with much greater certainty.P.Foreign Office, S.W. 1.Uth April, 1948.
