(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)  S C RJLT . 00pY NQ(CP. (UQ) 11123rd April,  19h8.CABINETDEATH PENALTY IN THE BRITISH ZONE OP germany memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at the meeting of the Cabinet on 15th April (CM. (1+8)28th Conclusions, Minute 2) I was invited to submit a memorandumon the question whether the death penalty should continue to be imposed as o penalty either for war crimes or by Control CommissionCourts for current criminal offences in Germany,RECOMMENDATION2. The suspension of the death penalty for murder inEngland will automatically involve its abolition in one class of case in Germany (namely that described in 3 (a) below) and in acorresponding class of case in Austria.      Apart from this,  i recommend that no change should be mode in respect of the death penalty in Germany or Austria.3* At present there are five sets of circumstances in whichthe death penalty may ho imposed in the British Zone of Germany:-(a) When a Control Commission Court is trying a british subject for on offence under English law for whichthe penalty in England would be death.(b) When a Control Commission Court is trying a person ofany nationality for murder under German Lav/ (that isto soy&apos; when it is deemed desirable to withdraw thecase from purely German Courts)  or for crimes againsthumanity under Control Council Lav/ No.   10.      Underneither law is the death penalty automatically requiredin any cose.A British subject might be tried under (b)  e.g, because he was being tried jointly with a German.      Thiseventuality is most unlikely to arise in practice andin any event the Military Governor has to refer to mebefore confirming any death sentence on a Britishsubj act.(c) When a German Court is trying a German (or, with military government authority, a person of any nationality)under German Lew or, in the case&apos;of crimes againsthumanity,  under Control Council Lav; No.   10.(d) When a Control Commission Court is trying a person ofany nationality under Military Government Ordinancesfor offences for which the death penalty is prescribed by such Ordinances,  that is to soy offences againstthe security of the Occupying Forces.
(e)    Trial for war crimes, viz:-(i)   -When a British Military Tribunal is trying a .case under the Royal Warrant of 18th June,19U5.(ii)    When a Control Commission Court is trying acase under. Control Council Law No.  10.It  should be noted that although,  as the Law Officers have advised, Control Commission Courts ore in law German Courts,in  (a) to (e)  above the expression Control Commission Court means a Court consisting of British judges and a German Court means aCourt consisting of German judges.hi.. In case (a)  above it naturally follows that,  if the death penalty for murder is suspended in English.Low,  it cannotbe awarded by a Control Commission Court trying a British subject for murder,  since- in these cases the Court applies the EnglishLow for the time being in force.      No suspension of the death penalty in England for treason has been proposed.5* In eases  (b)  and (c)  an amendment to the Gorman PenalCode and Control Council Law No.  10 would be required.      Forthe following reasons.I consider that these amendments shouldnot bo made-(i) Conditions in Germany are very different from thoseij -existing in the United Kingdom and crimes of violence ,A  are more frequent.(ii) The Teeth penalty for murder is prescribed by theGerman penal Code which was the responsibility ofthe former German Central Government.      We aredevolving more and more responsibility upon theGerman authorities and, in a matter in which HisMajesty&apos;s Government  allowed a free vote in the Houseof Commons, it would, be impolitic to force a change uponthe Germans.      The question is one of conscience and.any change in German Law should be left to theconscience of the Germans in due course.(iii) If any amendment were to be made at this time to theGerman Penal Code,  or the Control Council Lav/ No.   10,such an amendment should in principle be made for thewhole of Germany by the Allied Qontrol Council, butin the present state of quadripartite relations it is unlikely that the question could be discussed, at allby the Control Council.      Even if it were,  unanimityis not likely to be reached.      The death penalty stillexists in France and. America so that there is little likelihood of the representatives of these countriesagreeing to its abolition or suspension by on amendment to German Law.Unilateral amendment by the British Military Governorwithin his own Zone is possible but he considers itinappropriate,  and I agree with him,  to take unilateral action in such a matter.      Such a change in one zonewhen we are moving towards the fusion of the three western Zones would be must impolitic.(iv)
6, In case (d) above the death penalty is prescribed for various offences against the security of the Occupying Forces.For the following reasons I consider that it should not be abolished in these cases;-(i) Although relations between the British Occupying forces and the German people are not openly unfriendly,  theBritish arc there by right of conquest and there is always the possibility of single or concerted actsagainst the British which would require drasticj treatment.      The Military Governor is emphatic that; he must be allowed to retain this sanction againsti possible disturbances.(ii) The amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill suspendsthe death penalty for murder only and not for treason:.Offences against the British Occupying Forces,  though not identical with treason,  partake of its nature,&apos; - since they are acts against the present SupremeGovernment of Germany, and the decision taken onmurder in this country is,  therefore, no precedent for its abolition for offences against security inGermany.7. The Secretory of State for War, with whose view Iconcur,  considers that the death penalty for war crimes shouldbe retained for the following reasons:-(i) The whole process of trying war criminals is nownearly finished.      It is wrong to make this changeat a time when it is expected that! this processwill be completed in a.few months.(ii) Even   those countries such as Holland, Belgium and norway which have abolished the death penalty for ordinary crimes have specifically enacted it for war crimes.(iii) In paragraphs 5 and 6 above I have recommended foot the death penalty should not be abolished in cases  (b),(c)  and (o).      Public opinion would not understand the maintenance of the death penalty in those cases and its abolition for war crimes.(iv) The abolition of the death penalty for war crimes inthe British Zone alone would be inappropriate when itis being maintained in the American and French Zones.AUSTRIA8. Owing to the independence which the Austrian Governmentenjoys, we have no power to amend Austrian Law, even if we shoulddesire to do so,  in respect of the death penalty.9* Proposals which I have recently approved will mean thatin the very near future the British Military Courts in Austria,which correspond to the Control Commission Courts in Germany, willtry only:-(a) offences by officials and their families who arenationals of one of the occupying powers:(b) offences by persons of any nationality against thesecurity of the occupying forces.
t    10 710. British officials,  though they ere also subject to military Government law, will normally he tried under Englishlav/,  and will therefore he subject to the penalties prescribed by the low in force at the time in England.11. Military Government enactments prescribe the death penalty for serious offences against the occupation.      In thesecases I consider that the death penalty should be retained un austria for the same reasons as in Germany.12. War crimes trials have been completed in Austria.E.B.Foreign Office,  S.W.1.23rd April, 19U.8.
