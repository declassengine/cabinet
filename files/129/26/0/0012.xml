OBCtttATE0....3/.&apos;^.....Ai..J..&apos;..*. -THIS  DOCUMENT IS   THE PROPERTY OF  HIS   BRITANNIC  MAJESTY&apos;8  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1948SECRET Copy No.CP. (48) 1028th April, 1948CABINETAUSTRIAN   treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs there has been some progress in the last week on the Austrian treaty and I should like to acquaint my colleagues with the present position.2. In accepting the form of settlement proposed by the French, the Soviethave agreed to surrender to Austria any industries and properties, apart fromoil and Danube shipping, which they have previously claimed. In lieu of thesethey1 were to receive a lump sum payment. But the settlement proposed by theSoviet still presented Austria with a crippling economic burden. During the deputies&apos; discussions over the past six weeks the Western Delegations have therefore maintained a firm attitude.3. The Soviet representative has now received new instructions from moscow to reduce the Soviet claim for oil extraction and exploration rights from 66f percent, to 60 per cent, and the proposed lump sum payment from $200 million in two years to f 150 million in six years. The Appendix to this paper contains a brief statement of the present positions of the Soviet and Western Delegationson the various heads of the German assets question.4. These Soviet concessions still do not go far enough, if we are to giveAustria a reasonable chance of economic independence. But the controversyhas been narrowed down to two main fields oil exploration and the cash payment.As regards the first, we are most anxious that Austria should derive as muchbenefit as possible from her new oil industry, which has become almost her most valuable economic asset: for this reason the undeveloped areas are of even greater importance than those where production is at present going on, and we naturallywish to restrict the Soviet hold on them. As to the cash settlement, it is very doubtful whether, without American or other foreign aid, Austria can meet eventhe figure proposed by the Western Powers, if payment in convertible currencyis to be required of her. So far the Americans have made it clear that they see little prospect of getting Congress to agree to provide funds for what wouldbe in effect direct reparation payments to Russia. Therefore we must try tobring the Soviet figure down as much as possible, and to ease the terms of payment.5. Until now the Deputies&apos; meetings have been entirely devoted to thequestion of German assets, and they have not yet discussed the other unagreedArticles of the Treaty. These include certain vital questions such as frontiers,reparations and the military clauses. The Western Delegations have no intentionof yielding on these questions : it remains to be seen whether the Soviet willmake a prolonged stand on them. It would be optimistic to expect very early agreement on the whole Treaty, but it does now appear possible that the SovietGovernment have accepted the idea of reaching agreement at least on the german assets question in the not too distant future.6. Even after the Treaty has been agreed by the Deputies we shall have,to consider very carefully whether or not the international situation does indeedpermit the withdrawal of the troops of the Western Powers from Austria.E.
