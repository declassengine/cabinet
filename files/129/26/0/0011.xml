**0^1: ^   A^ojJt&quot;CABINETTHE FRENCH BALANCE OP PAYMENTS DEFICITMemorandum by. the Chancellor of the exchequer referred at the last meeting of the economic policy Committee (E.P.C. (L,8) 12th Meeting, Minute k)  to the difficult problem posed by the deficit in the French balanceof payments with the sterling area, which they estimate at avery high figure.      The Overseas Negotiations Committee hasnow prepared a report on this question,  of which I attach acopy.2. I have discussed, this report with the foreign secretary.      As there is very little time before the next meeting of the Anglo-French Economic Committee,  we have authorised our Delegation&apos;to proceed on the lines recommended in paragraph 31 of the Report. i3* This,  in particular, means that we shall proposeto the French that we and they should invoke Article VII ofthe Treaty of Brussels and should bring the matter beforethe Consultative Council in a wider context.      If the Frenchagree to this proposal (as I expect them to do), I proposethat the Foreign Secretary should be asked to seize the consultative Council of the question, acting jointly withthe French Minister of Foreign Affairs,  and to suggest thatit should be dealt with by a meeting of the Finance ministers of the Five Powers.      We can decide -later,  in the light ofthe French reception of our proposal, whether this meeting should be preceded by Five-Power discussions&apos;at the official level.COPY NO.R. S.

B^LQZii^Y-Jdm^QlcrBejiaJ^ego ti Qt&amp;msJZSMll fetejgI -    Ttio ProblemHg lcit with, tfre.^&amp;  liag-*l  aWe have known for some time that Prenee was    in heavydeficit with the sterling area,  but she had sizeable sterling balances,  and it did not appear that the problem was immediate.However,  at a meeting of the Anglo-French Economic Committeeon 19th March it emerged that, on the basis of trade figuresproduced by the French,   the position was getting very rapidlyworse.      On the basis of existing policies (i.e. before taking any corrective action),   the deficit of the franc area with the sterling area for the calendar year 19I4.8 looks like beingsomething between  65 and  85 millions.     French sterling balances at the beginning of the year were just over  50 millions.Therefore, unless we extend credit to France,  she will be indefault long before the end of the year if those figures areanything like correct.     They are,  in fact, most unreliable, butthe  true position is not likely to be better than the lowerlimit of the deficit given above,  and even that means default.This is borne cut by the rate at which their sterling has been running out.      The French themselves think that they will be indefault on their sterling commitments about the end of June,unless wc provide them with accommodation.2.      Prfjclt wUhThis is only one aspect of Franco&apos;3 general position.    Beforethe war, she was normally in deficit with the sterling area butin surplus with countries such as Belgium and Switzerland, and sobalanced her accounts.     Now she is in deficit all round.     She-is rlready in default in Belgium:    has just got- out cf defaultwith Switzerland by a new agreement;    and was one of the firstcountries to run out of dollars and to go on to interim aid.3.      Size of French Requirements free; the Sterling Area.,The French claim that the import programme on &quot;which their estimates are based is an absolute minimum,   strictly confined  to,the essential raw materials which are needed to keep theirindustry olive.      This is probably more or less true.     We navenot been able to examine it closely in the time and with the data available:      but it certainly is largely confined to rawmaterials such as- wool,   cotton, rubber and jute and the amountsdo not seem excessive at first glance.      They are far belowpre-war imports;    .the value is above last year&apos;s programme butth- French  tell us too-- thifi is wh^xxy due to uy.e rise in prices.If we were ho stand behind the French;  we should have to look for more closely at their prbgrammed,.     On such indicationsas we have,  we should probably find the following: -(a) that the true programme was something a good deal higherthan the detailed figures sot out before us,  since their controlsare weak and their machinery of planning doubtful.      The Frenchthemselves warned us of this.(b) that there will be many places where the programme can-be cut on a basis of austerity,  but that it is not overall anextravagant one,  subject always to (c)  below.-1-
(c)    that their stocks are fairly high and they could live onthorn to some extent, provided always that they could got at them,which is far from sure; and that probably too many of the rawmaterials go into the home market, by our standard, and not enough to exports.4.      Consequences of the French financial and economic policyAll this  is a natural consequence of French economic andfinancial policy.    M. Mayer&apos;s policy, within the limits of theresources available to him, has been to relax controls,  tostock up, to provide goods for consumption - in short to gamble(as the Belgians did earlier on)  on having enough goods in the pipeline to allow the ordinary forces of sup-ply and demand toplay.    This comes out expensive in the short run -where imports are concerned:    M, Mayer1, s answer to that would be that he has done no more than recognise the facts,  and that if he had refused to do so and had kept on controls which just did notwork, his position would have been even worse.5.      The position is much aggravated by M. Mayer&apos;s currencypolicy.    He established a free market for dollars and otherconvertible currencies and let the sterling/dollar cross-rate go.We always feared,  and told the French,  that this would lead to increased purchases from the sterling area and decreased, sales to it.    All the signs are that this  has happened.    Frenchmenhave been encouraged to hedge by buying commodities as far aheadas possible; and the dual rate structure has encouraged, them to buy thorn for sterling,    Everything in M. Mayer&apos;s policy hascombined to run him out of sterling.II.    The oonsequerices of doin/: nothing6.      Suppose we refuse to extend, credit to the French and merelydo the little  that we can over the next few months by way of increases of trade etc.    .le shall not come near to bridgingthe gap,  and there will be a default, as the French say, aboutthe end of June,    Of course they should have foreseen and guarded against it, but they did not, and it is too late to make muchof a point of that; nor is it easy to foresee everything, aswe found when we went into default with Belgium in just thesame way.7.      Effect on sterling areaBut a French default with the sterling area would be a farbigger thing than ours or theirs with Belgium,    It would meanbroken contracts and uncovered credits all over the sterling area,    French purchases  in the sterling area are running atsomething over 510 millions a month, of which a considerable part is in respect of imports of machinery and other manufacturedgoods from the United Kingdom,    If the French really got downto bedrock,  their imports of such  goods would presumably take firstcut.    This would certainly be serious for our manufacturers,  someof whom would probably be left holding goods which they couldnot dispose of elsewhere except at knockdown prices.    The withdrawalof so large a buyer as France from the wool auctions might resultin some of the clip not being taken up, but most of the sterling-area raw material could bs sold to other countries.    Withoutknowing how big the gap would, be or what purchases they would cutback,  one cannot say whether the withdrawal of French demandswould affect the world, prices of sterling area raw materials, andso reduce our hard currency earnings.    As regards the UnitedKingdom&apos;s&apos;essential supplies from France, there is no real reasonto suppose that we should not continue  to obtain as much as atpresent.    Generally speaking.,  therefore, the effect on. our owneconomy if the French default&apos;would be disruptive but notcatastrophic.    On the financial side, a French defeult would inevitably lead
to an unsupported.,  so .. market in. sAerlin^ aga :i not - francs.This would he yet anotner element , and a very important one,in the &quot;breakdown of the system of exchange stability which- we have done our best to foster.    Thus the effects of a Frenchdefault, if one looks only at the immediate picture of relationsbetween France and the sterling area, would be highlyinconvenient but not disastrous for us;    end we should escapea position where we are exchanging valuable raw materials for supplies which contain some equally valuable things but others of small utility,3.     affect on france the effect on France would be far more serious.,    Their- supplies from the sterling area are not less important to them than supplies from the United States,, an/1 eer tainly count&apos; for far merethan their imports from the European&apos;countries with whom theyare in difficulty.   As they are nearly all raw materials, any significant cut-back in their programme beyond the economies which a fresh scrutiny should bring means a out-back in production, unemployment in industry^ and in moot cases areduction of exports and a worse balance of payments next year -the familiar sequence of inanition which we end they are resolved to do anything: to avoid.,    They need help to get over their sterling difficulties no less than for their dollar difficulties.9.      ,cAitio.aJ.Af octOne has also to consider the political effect and theeffect on all plans for Weatorn It&apos;.europe.,    These ?.re not for thisCommittee to assess? but it is obvious that at this moment acomplete breakdown in the commercial relations between the two main partners in Western Union and PJ.R.P,  is not lightly to be envisaged.    Nor can the crisis be hidden for long.,    if we are not going to do -whatever is necessary from cur side to avert the crisis about the end of June, we owe it as a matter of honestytc our own exporters and those of the rest of the sterling area to warn them publicly at once of too position se that they maylimit their liabilities,    This is something which we cannot defermore than a week or so,III.     Measures for averting the crisis10. So much for what happens if we take no stops to meet theimmediate crisis. Wo now turn to the measures which might betoken tc avert it.    These we classify under three heads:-(a) Short-term expedients: measures which can take effect withinthe next few months, in time to avert the immediate threat ofdefault;(b) Medium-term expedients; measures which will help to bridge the gap over the next year or two, &quot;while E.,R,gp... is with us,giving time for a long-range change in our present r.lotionswhich may bring us into equilibrium^(c) Long-term expedients: measures which we can carry out,  oranticipated events outside our power to bring about,, which willin the long run restore equilibriums
11(a)    Short-term ExpedientsThere are only throe months before the threatened default.Nothing that we can do to trade either way will seriously affectthe issue in time.    In theory there -are only two short-termexpedients;  in practice only one.    The first is that the french should, cover their deficit with us &quot;by gold or dollars  (as ourmonetary agreement with them provides); but they have none,and. we need waste no time on this.    The second is that we should extend credit to carry them, over the immediate crisis until thebalance can be redressed - if it ever can.12(b)    Medium-term expedientsThere is no one cure-all to carry us. over the next two orthree years.    There are a set of different expedients,  whichmay or may not prove sufficient.     /ith reasonably good luck,they may bridge the gap; with bad luck their may not and we shallhave to go on extending credit for a long time.    As some of theexpedients depend, on the form of E.H.P, ,  it is impossible atthis date to say what they will amount to as a whole.13*      Drench economy in importsTh is the first and obvious recourse.(a) The French cannot be said to have been lavish in their imports either in Metropolitan France or the French colonies in less essential goods from the United Kingdom.    On the contrary,the austerity of their import licensing policy has caused usa good deal- of trouble with United Kingdom exporters, who have-been cut off from what was in many cases a traditional marketof considerable importance, and one in which they are naturallyanxious to maintain at least a footing against better times.    Inthe early part of 1947, we persuaded France  to agree to a limitedsystem, of token imports and at the meeting in December last,we secured their agreement in principle to setting aside in 1948 5 mn.  to cover imports from the United Kingdom of less essential goods,  on the basis  of a list of import quotas to be proposed by us.    At the recent meeting of the Committee,  theFrench made it clear that despite the worsening in their sterlingposition, they regarded their undertaking of December as an engagement, which they were bound to fulfil unless we offered to release them.    Obviously in a situation where we may have toextend credit to the French to enable  them to finance their essential imports,  it does not make sense  to oblige  them to spendsterling on goods they do not need.    Y/e therefore recommend thatwe should inform them that we are willing to agree to the implementation of their undertaking being suspended, on theunderstanding that (i) we shall be free to take up ad hocindividual items which, although small In terms of money, proveparticularly troublesome, and (ii)  if  they admit imports fromany other country with which they have a deficit, they will issueimport licences for similar United. Kingdom goods,(b) As regards imports of essential goods,  the French should take steps not merely to limit further purchases, but also to ensurethe physical import of stocks now held abroad,.    How the lattercan be achieved is a. matter for the French, and. as it involves a reversal of the policy of the present French. Government, itwill clearly be a matter of great difficulty to secure their consent to the necessary measures.    But we are entitled to ask forthe most stringent measures, including the refusal offranc-   credits, to raw materials importers.    It Is also
worth considering whether any credits given should not be through banking channels (with a Government guarantee) so thatthe credit givers should hold title to the commodities, atleast until their physical arrival in France.    But it mustbe recognised that we should not thereby bridge the gap.    Someof the difficulties are dealt with in paragraph 23 below.Ik.    United Kingdom imports of less essential goods fromFranceThere is, in the context of the gap of  SOmn., very littlemore that we can do to help,  sines we are/already taking importsvery freely from Franco.    The Angle-French Economic Committeehas just been over the ground and has agreed that the UnitedKingdom should  take  5.5mn. more in 19US than in 19U7.    TheCommittee identified a further  hmn. of manufactured goods which we can take under existing import policy (if this wereinterpreted very liberally), plus about  2mn. more of food and drink if supplies were available.    If we wore willing to go tothe absolute limit, the French could sell another  hmn. , but theimport of those further goods would involve:-(a) A greater measure of discrimination in favour of Francethan wo have hitherto felt -dole to justify;(b) Repercussions from the United Kingdom industries affected,many of which have been set very high export targets;    and(c) Taking luxury goods of a kind and of a quality beyond thelimits which Ministers have hitherto been willing to contemplate.We suggest that we should agree to take a further  6mn.  ofimports ( hmn.  if manufactured goods plus  ?.mn.  of food and drink) referred to- above.    We do not recommend that.we should go further because the difficulties referred to in (a)  to ( c)above would, in our view,  outweigh the marginal advantage of adding another  hmn.  to the French sterling earnings.15.     Sterling area imports from france the French complain that they have difficulty in obtaining,entry for their goods,  from time to time, into the Dominionsand Colonies.&apos; There can be very little in this, as we havealready fcdld the sterling area that France is as soffc-cmrroncya source as they come, and the rest is up tc them,16.     Dominion credits for FranceIf credits are to be given, we should consider at thattime whether to invite the Dominions to come in, and if so,on what conditions.    New Zealand has already given a credit of  5 million for wool, but other Uoiuinioris 1-give so far-been unwilling,17.     Third-country transfersWe could encourage transfers of sterling from third countries to France, and restrict them from France to third countries.    There is very little in the first expedient,  sinceFrance is the universal debtor;    and even if she regained hertraditional position as creditor of many European countries,she still has to work off large debts to them (therefore any arrangements between the European countries for the freezingof existing debts helps us in that respect).    The second Is
necessary if there is to be a breakdown, since wc want Britishcreditors to be paid before foreign ones;    but otherwise weshould prefer not to force this issue, as the one Tracertanttransfer by Prance is to Egypt, for cotton, and if she does notimport this cotton her capacity to pay later on will be furtherrestricted by the drop in her exports.    On the other hand areduction in French buying might bring down the high Egyptianprice.*      0 f f - s h oo.-&apos; e pur c ha s esFrench officials have suggested to us unofficially thatthey might ask the ddministraBpr to,spend, some of. theirallocation of aid on raw materials from the sterling area Dominions. (The same proposal might be applied to sterlingoil, but there are many complications about this which are being brought separately to the attention of Ministers.)    We are told that &quot;French Ministers have since rejected the idea.    It seems-well worth pursuing, none the less, since it means that we should get paid pro tanto&quot;in dollars.    But, even if we can persuade theFrench, it is uncertain whether the Administrator   will bite -particularly if the French are lukewarn about the proposal - orhow much could be bought in this way.19.      The &quot;Ansiaux Plan&quot;This is a rather complicated lout attractive plan which hasbeen germinating for seme time, for the extension of credit to each other by the 16 notions up to a proportion of the aidwhich each receives from the United States.    So far it has only been considered by the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Holland,and Italy, who are agreed on it.    It is due to be put to the16 when the E.R.P. Bill is through, and then to the Administrator.If it survives, it will cover seme of the gap, but it is notyet clear on what scale it will operate,20.    There are several ether minor bright ideas which we are considering, all of which may help to some extent.    This is essentially a problem to bo attacked by the cumulative effectof a number of measures - just like our financial and trade relations with Belgium, in reverse.21 (c). Lone-term expedientsIf we leave our long-term relations with Prance to themselves, there is practically no chance of their rightingthemselves.    The more&quot;candid Frenchmen admit this at once.    Theyshould improve as the terms  of trade improve, and some of the factors which swell the 19h8 deficit are probably non-recurrent,but there is little reason to think that we shall reach acomplete balance in the foreseeable future.    The terms of tradeare never likely te get back to the relations between the pricesof raw material and manufactured goods which suits the French, andthat degree of transferobility which enables them freely to offset their debt with the sterling pvea by tliwir creditselsewhere is not yet in 8i&amp;h-fc.
22.     Therefore it is worthwhile considering how for theproduction of the French Union can he developed to fit our needs, and in particular to save us dollar expenditure.   Wehave t-een able to make only a very preliminary review of thisquestion, which, wo suggest, might usefully be referred to the continuing Organisation.    It would not appear likely that the direct trade between France and the French Empire, on the onehand, and the Sterling area, on the other, can profitably bodeveloped to the point where the two arc in balance.    Froma long-term point of view, there is more to be gained if wecan again enjoy a surplus with France and the French Empire,which can be transferred either into Western Hemispherecurrencies (if that is possible) or into other currencies (suchas the Belgian)  in which we must make increased payments if weare to switch our purchases from the Western Hemisphere.   Thechief opportunities for relatively short-term expansion in tradewith Metropolitan Franco (if we exclude the Luxury trades inwhich Franco has tx long-standing reputation) would appear tobe softwood (including pit-props), potash (where we are atpresent dependent on supplies from the Russian Zone of Germany)and steel (if the coke an! materials can be found),   From north africa we could with advantage take more iron ore and possiblymore phosphate rock.    The French Empire has also resources ofhardwood, which would be useful.    From a longer-term point ofview,  it might be possible to examine with the French GoVer-nvnentthe possibilities of enabling us to switch to the Freiudi ^Empire some of our&apos;hard-currency purchases of moat and hides(Madagascar is an exporter), tobacco, cotton and possiblypaper-making materials.    Those are only intended as instances of possible developmentseIV.      The conditions of any aid23.     If we are to extend credit to France, wo can naturallyimposo certain c oriditions.Reduction of InrportsThe first arid moat obvious one is that they should review their import programme and economise wherever possible.    Thispoint has already boon made, with emphasis and at every level,up to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s recent communication to M. Bidaultand voo suggest this should be a condition precedent of the loan.The French have net withheld details and expect us to go throughit carefully with thorn.    but we suggest that there is room forcare in the method    I doing it.    We have the right to ask themfor results - to get by with so much imports of a givencommodity in the light of a given stock and demand position,but not to tell them how they shall do it or what controls theyshould put on to achieve the end.    The position is a ticklishone, as between our own controlled economy and their recentlyliberated one;    but the last thing that suits us is to establish the principle that a creditor has the right to tell a debtorstate how it should organise its economy;    otherwise we mighthear something about socialism from the United States, whohave so far been moat scrupulous to avoid any iufcttt-favmoain conusction. -with E.R.P.2J1,     French eg,-operation in lona-term schemes.As a further condition of short-term aid, wo can askeo-oporation in any long-term schemes for righting the balanceof payments, and wo should imagine; that it would readily begrantad.
25.    Return to unitary exchange ratesPar more difficult and contentious is whether we should,seek to impose as a condition the  return of France to asystem of unitary exchange rates.    It is true that thereare serious political difficulties in the way of acceptance ofM. -Mayer of an admission that his policy has failed;  he stillbelieves that his policy is succeeding, is in the interest ofFrance and has done us no harm.    Moreover, open opposition by us is  one  thing.    Blackmail as the price of help is another.A French refusal to submit could have most damaging consequences,both to Western Union ideas generally, and to confidence in sterling in particular.26,      nevertheless,  the argument for insisting on putting an end to the multiple rate system seems overwhelming.    There can be nodoubt that it is causing the moot serious damage to the positionof sterling.    It is upsetting the whole European rate structure.It is a  direct cause of the French over-spending of sterling andof a failure to export to the non-dollar countries which is inno way compensated by increased exports to the Western hemisphere.It is thus difficult indeed to defend, a policy which would condonea continuance of the existing French system.    There is,moreover, the argument that the Fond should,  in the near future,call upon the French to report on their &quot;experiment&quot;.    the battle need not be a direct Anglo-French engagement.    It can and should be staged, on the Washington terrain, but preferablyafter an understanding has been reached, as suggested inparagraph 28 below, between the five signatories of the &quot;brussels treaty,27,      It is doubtful whether we can escape this battle, sooner or later, except at the expense  of acquiescing in a growingchaos in currency relations which can fatally weaken sterling^and  thereby risk a read, collapse of intra-Fur ope an relations,&apos;which would stultify any efforts we may now make to rescueFrance.    If so,  the sooner the brittle is faced, and- on groundfavourable to ourselves&apos;,  the better.    We need not insist ona fixed rate for the dollar in terms of francs.    It would,meet our practical purpose  (and the only real scruples held bythe Americans  on this subject)  if sterling were put on the  freemarket, and the French agreed to support the cross-rote.    Thisis now far more feasible  than might have appeared even quiterecently.    The shortage of sterling, and the fact that Frenchprivate balances in London are blocked, may cause a rise inthe rate,  and the closer scrutiny and control of the uses  towhich sterling can be put will tend in the same direction.V.      The French crisis and Western union28.      What has been said so far illustrates  some  of thedifficulties of coping with the French, crisis  on a purelybilateral basis.    We are  too likely to find ourselvespouring good money after bad.    Wo may find that we arehelping the French in such a way as to let her othercreditors off their share of the  job.    It is not easy toimpose all the conditions that we should like.    Althoughit goes rather outside our competence to cover all theground or to form a very definite recommendation, we suggestth--t a solution should be found,  if possible,  on a multilateralbasis,    -0,3.3. C. would be s suitable forum, but it is not
yet sufficiently organised.    But there is much to Be said forwidening the scope of the problem to cover the five signatories of the Treaty of Brussels and getting the matter discussed betweenthem.    Those five countries are, at the moment, the focus offinancial and economic trouble,  and the successive crises which arise Between them, might be regarded as evidence  that therewas no substantial ground for the hopes expressed at the timeof signature;  the five countries have this common interest;  tokeep the structure of the Treaty alive, and should work to preserve it.    Any/arrangement should be brought into relationwith the work of the continuing organisation when it is formedis envisaged in Article I of the Treaty,29.      The following, broadly but not inaccurately, is  the present financial position between the  signatory powers  (Belgium and luxembourg, who have an economic union, count as one):-United Kingdom/Prance Crisis  just on usUnited Kingdom/Belgium &apos;    Crisis just surmounted;position still difficultUnited Kingdom/Holland Under controlFrance/Belgium Complete breakdownFrance/Holland No diff1cultyBe 1 g iuii i/i I o 11 a nd Cri s i s imp e nd i n gThe only wonder is that there has as yet been no publicsuggestion that the economic part of the Treaty of Brussels shouldbe invoked to deal&apos;with them.    It is desirable to forestall suchsuggestions, and to take the initiative ourselves. We are in a goodposition to do so, since at the moment we have something to offer(to France)  and nothing to ask of anyone  (much as we might liketo alter our Belgium agreement, it would be very rash to touchit).    Unless Belgium will help,  her position with France endHolland, will not mend;  for internal reasons if for no other, shedare not now extend further credit;  yet she might possibly do something if it was as part of a five-power effort to setmatters to right,30,      The kind of scheme we hove in mind - and it needs muchcloser examination - is  that each of the  signatory powers should declare itself willing to extend n limited amount of credit where necessary to allow trade to continue for the restof the year.    The terms on which the credit should be repaidshould be decided at the end of the year, but it should bolaid down at once that it should, not be in gold or dollars.The avowed object of this operation should be a short-termone - to avoid breakdown during the period before E.R.P,, andto allow time to consider expedients for getting out of thepresent mess.    Each pair of powers would,  as at present,consider the medium-term expedients open to them, and insofar as they were of multilateral interest or occupation,  all fivewould consult together and keep each other fully informed.At the same  time each pair of -powers and. all five togetherwould consult together on long-term expedients of the typeMentioned above.    The other Marshall nations would bo keptfully in touch;  any one of them could, where relevant,  join the system;  and any of the activities mentioned, which fell within the ambit of any of the organisms arising from the paris Conference would not be withdrawn from it.    On currencymatters, it should, be the aim of all five powers to achieve,by the end of the year, where  this did not alreadystability and a healthy relationship.
VI.    Roc OTiime agenda ti one.31,      A further meeting of the Anglo-French Economic Committeehas been fixed for the 8th April next,    Wo recommend that theUnited Kingdom Delegation be authorised to take the following1 ine: -(a) Thoy should at once agree to enlarge imports  intothe United Kingdom to the extent proposed in paragraph 14 above( 11,5 million)  and to modify on the linos suggested inparagraph 15  (a)  above our claim that the French shouldadmit  3 million of our inessential exports.  This is&quot; within thenormal scope of the Committee. &apos; it would, dispose of these;,palliatives once and for oil and dispel any illusions vlv.v theywill solve the problem,(b) They should explain that aid to the French to an extent which would bridge the remaining gap of S50- 70 million is beyond the bounds of possibility;  and they should,  against the background of this explanation, examine  the French import programme and do all they can to persuade  the French to narrowthe gap &quot;by their own measures,(c) They should say that any contribution which theUnited. Kingdom might agree  to give could, only be very limited;with the best will in the world we are not strong enough tocarry the burden alone.    They should therefore suggest that we and the French should invoke Article VII of the Treaty ofBrussels, and should jointly bring the matter before the consultative Council, not as a purely Anglo-French problembut as port of the economic malaise which affects all the signatory powers, and for which a short-term solution shouldbe found,  till about the end of the year, until the fruits ofEuropean co-operation end amorican aid begin to ripen.    any contribution could only be offered within the framework of sucha solution.(d) They should make it very clear that any solutionfound should not be exclusive but should be designed inconsultation and co-operation with the rest of the Sixteen,  as envisaged in article I of the Treaty.(e) They should warn the French that we shall have topress the exchange rate question and! should camva.ss the  solutionproposed, in paragraph ;-J7 without at that stage pushing the matter to an issue, since wo want the main discussion to take placein the Consultative Council.(f) Their general attitude should be rather discouragingin order to drive the French back to realities  and they should press for urgent action, pointing out that unless a solution isfound quickly, we shall have to warn exporters all over the sterling Area of the danger of a default.152.      Although It Is not proposed that the delegation should at this stage be given authority to enter into any firm commitment with the French,  the above recommendations involve a real decision now as to whether we are to support France or not.If we were really ready to let France sin?; or swim,  it would bebetter to say so at once, warn our exporters and limit our losses.    If we go ahead on the . other tack,  as we propose, andstart talks, we are bound to see the French through fora few months, even if things go badly;    all other reasonsapart, we shall have taken the responsibility of not warning
our own exporters and the  sterling area to cut their losses while they can.    Similarly if the negotiations gonot badly but slowly,  so that she French run out of sterling before  they are concluded,  it will be unavoidable that we  should, lend them say 55 or  10million to carry on.3d.      If our suggestions are approved, we recommend: -(a) That,  to avoid any loss of time,- arrangements should be mode to set the five- &apos;Ower machinery in motionas soon as the delegation report that the French are willing,(b) That there should be a further examination bythe Treasury,  in conjunction with the  other interested departments, of the merits and demerits of seelcing a contribution -(i)    from those Dominions which areprincipal exporters to France,and(ii)&apos;   by way of off-shore purchases from the  sterling area underE.R.P.-11-
