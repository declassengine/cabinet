(48) 85).R. S. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,13th April, 1948.FORTNIGHTLY  ECONOMIC   report . Man-PowerTotal man-power in civil employment rose in February by 29,000. This risereflects the normal absorption into employment of men from the Forces. Thenumber of women, which had decreased in the previous two months, was unchangedin February.2. Total man-power in building and civil engineering declined from1 - 36 million in December to 1-34 million in February.Undermanned industries3. Employment in coal mining continues to rise. The number of workers on the colliery books has increased from 718,000 at the beginning of the year to723,800 at 27th March an average of about 480 a week. Just over a thirdof the gross intake consisted of ex-miners from the Forces or from other industries.4. Employment continued to increase in February in the textile industries.There was an increase of 3,000 in cotton, 1,000 in wool, and 1,000 in rayon. Cottonspinning also recorded a further increase in employment in the first half ofMarch. The strike among card-room workers at Bolton resulted in a fall in thenumber at work in the third week of March.U nemployment5. The number of insured unemployed fell further to 299,400 at 15th March.Foreign workers6. By the end of March 134,526 foreign workers had been placed inemployment in Great Britain under official schemes. 12,780 were placed inJanuary, 14,126 in February and 10,988 in March.7. These figures include 5,228 ex-prisoners of war given civilian status towork in agriculture in January, 6,354 in February and 3,048 in March. On theother hand the number of female European volunteeer workers placed since thebeginning of the year was only 1,989.35210 B
II.-Production. . 8. The index of industrial production for February will be available atthe end of this week. Provisional figures suggest that the volume of production(adjusted for differences in the number of normal working days) in february was greater than in January, and above the average for the fourth quarter of 1947.Coal        - &apos;   &quot; &quot;    &apos;!&apos;9. Total production of deep-mined and opencast coal in the first 14 weeks of this year amounted to 56-7 million tons or 2-4 per cent, above the target of55 - 3 million tons for this period. Production declined in the last two weeks ofMarch owing to the Easter holiday but total output for these two weeks taken together was above the target (for this fortnight). Deliveries of coal for overseasshipments and bunkers rose to 244,000 tons in the last week of March.Total production of deep-mined and opencast coal	Production		Excess over	target^)	x   Production	target	Thousand tons	Thousand tons	Per cent.1948 January (weekly average)   ...	3,988	4,111	+ 3-1February (weekly average) ...	4,028	4,101	4- 1-8Week ended 			March 6............	4,120	4,230	4- 2-713............	4,160	4,228	4- 1-620............	4,200	4,308	4- 2-627............	3,520	3,789	4- 7-6April    3............	3,010	3,001	- 0-310 ...	4,270	4,268	 P)	211 million tons in	1948.	Steel10. Production of steel ingots rose to 296,000 tons in the first week of Marchand was maintained at about this level during the month. Production of pigiron also rose further from an average of 176,000 tons a week in February to anaverage of 180,000 tons a week in the first four weeks of March.11. Stocks of scrap are being maintained at about. 350,000 tons but stocksof pig iron have fallen further from 388,000 tons at the end of February to 368,000tons at 27th March.Textiles12. The output of cotton yarn (excluding waste yarn) increased from15-57 million lb. a week in February to 15-86 million lb. in the second week ofMarch but declined because of a dispute to 15-3 million lb. in the third week.Production in the last week of March fell to 12-54 million lb. owing to the Easterholiday. Production of woven cotton and rayon fabrics was 46-8 million linearyards in February but this was still slightly below the November rate of output.Textile production	Cotton yarn Million Ib.(*)	Rayon yarn and staple fibre Million ]b.(*)	Woven cotton and rayon fabrics Million linear yards (*)	Worsted yarn Million lb.(*)	Woven wool fabrics Million linear yards (2)1937......	23-7	12-3	79-3	18-7	1946      ......	12-73	14-9	38-0	12-1	18-61947 September...	12-94	18-8	39-2	14-3	21-9October   ...	14-40*	20-1	43-7*	15-8	23-9November...	14-80	18-3	47-2	14-2	21-0December ...	13-48	19-2	41-7	14-0	20-21948 January   ...	14-60*	19-6	43-0*	15-6	23-0February ...	15-57	18-8	46-8	14-2	22-2March  6 ...	15-68				13 ...	15-86				20 ...	15-33				27 ...	12-54				f1) Weekly average. * Average of five weeks.(2) Monthly average or calendar month.
Motor Vehicles13. Motor vehicle production declined in February (Table 5). (Both january and February were 4 week months.) 67 per cent, of the number of passenger car sand 48 per cent, of the number of commercial motor vehicles produced in Februarywere for export.14. Exports of vehicles include a larger proportion of the smaller types of vehicles and of chassis as compared with total production. In January 1948,67 per cent, of the passenger cars and chassis produced were for export but theserepresented 50 per cent, by value. Similarly 45 per cent, of the number of com-mercial motor vehicles and chassis produced were for export representing only30 per cent, by value.Proportion of motor vehicle production for export1947 1st Otr.2nd Qtr.3rd Qtr.4th Qtr.1948 JanuaryFebruaryPassenger carsf1)Per cent,by number4547576466-766-9Per cent,by value35-037-546-451-649-6Commercial motor vehicles (J)Per cent,by number29&apos;30&apos;32&apos;36&apos;44-848-0Per cent,by value24-125-925-328-529-7I1) Excluding production for the Services.III.-Building15. The number of new permanent houses completed in Great Britain rose to 15,725 in February. 9,043 houses were started and the number under construc-tion, therefore, declined further from 246,924 at the end of January to 240,242at the end of February. This compares with the peak figure of 261,216 houses under construction at the end of October 1947.16. New contracts for permanent houses are being kept down. They were reduced again in February from 6,982 to 5,768.17. Although production and deliveries of building bricks continue to fall,production is still in excess of deliveries and stocks continue to rise.Building bricks (millions)Production Deliveries          Stocks end of period1938 monthly average 650 - - - -1947 monthly average 378 3721947 October...... 467 463 260November       ... 410 381 289December       ... 388 336 3481948 January          ... &apos;     386 305 428February         ... 361IY. External Trade18. British exports declined in February, which was a short month, from 119-5 to  112-9 million. The volume of exports in February was 21 per cent,above the average of 1938 and 3 per cent, above the average for the fourth quarterof 1947. The value of exports in March is provisionally estimated at over 120 million.19. Imports fell in February from  161-8 to  148-1 million, the reductionbeing mainly in imports of food, drink and tobacco. Imports of raw materialswere greater than in January. Imports in March were  178 million the highestfor several months.20. The visible adverse balance of trade with the Western Hemispheredeclined in February. Exports were maintained at about  20 million but imports were reduced from  65 million in January to  57 million.35210 b 2
Y. Balance of Payments21. The net drain on reserves during March amounted to  47 millionbringing the total for the first quarter of 1948 up to  147 million. This is 30 million in excess of the forecast given in CP. (48) 35 an excess which is accounted for mainly by the following : (a) South Africa took more than  10 million against nothing allowed inthe forecast. (It is hoped during the current quarter to retrieve mostof this under agreement with the South Africans.)(b) Belgium drew more than  15 million in gold, compared with the estimateof  7-5 million.(c) We gave the Canadians about  5 million more in repayment of theinterest-free loan than we received from the sale of securities. In the forecast these two items were assumed to balance.(d) Egypt took the whole of her year&apos;s ration of dollars,  7 million, against our estimate of one-quarter of this amount.22. Despite these additions to the drain our gold and dollar holdings atthe end of March at  552 million were only  9 million lower than was forecast.Against a larger drain of  30 million the United Kingdom drew  15 million from the International Monetary Fund and India drew  7 million (which wasdeposited in the central reserves), while drawings on the United States creditwere  1 million less than the round  75 million ($300 million) entered in theoriginal estimate.  millionThus:   Extra drain        ..................       30Smaller drawings on United States credit    ...      ... 1Drawings on International Monetary Fund ...Larger decline in gold and dollar holdings than forecast22923. During the three weeks ended 3rd April a marked decline in the rateof drain has taken place, due primarily to a big reduction in payments for supplies from Canada and to some improvement in dollar receipts. It is not yetclear how far the relief in respect of Canada represents deliberate withholding of the submission of bills by the Canadians. At the same time the Belgian losshas continued heavily and amounted to $ 12 million during the three weeks ended3rd April.Total net drain on reserves^)1947-First halfJuly ...August ...SeptemberOctoberNovemberDecember1948-january february march  .../ million467133156936759484347(*)(&apos;) Including drawings on United States and Canadian credits and theInternational Monetary Fund.(2) Including  9 million repayment of Canadian interest-free loan.YI. Bilateral Negotiations24. Since the last report no new agreements have been concluded, but out-standing points under the Belgian and Swedish Agreements have been settled.Negotiations with Turkey and S.C.A.P. (Japan) are continuing : those with Brazilare approaching conclusion, and those with Mexico have been temporarilyadjourned for consultation.
25. Since the last report new talks have started with Yugoslavia (for ashort-term agreement), with Hungary (on food and trade), with Ceylon (on sterling balances and dollar requirements) and with France, and are continuingat present.26. The French talks revealed that the franc area will have a very largedeficit with the sterling area, which cannot be bridged by the normal means oftrade adjustments, and the talks were adjourned over Easter. Agreement withthe French has now been reached on proposals to refer the problem (which is aWest European rather than a purely Anglo-French one) to the consultative council of the Western Union Powers under Article VII of the Treaty of Brussels.YII. Prices and FinanceRetail prices27. The Ministry of Labour index of retail prices (17th June 1947 ^00)rose from 104 in January to 106 in February. The index of food prices increasedsharply from 104 to 108 owing partly to higher prices of bacon and shell eggs.The indices for clothing, fuel and light and of services also rose in February.Index of retail prices (17th June 1947 = 100)13th January 17&apos;th FebruaryAll items......      ...      -.         104 106Food       ............         104 08Rent and rates......... 100Clothing............         103 04Fuel and light.........         109 110Household durable goods      ...         108 108Miscellaneous goods     ......

The index of import prices(1938 = 100) which was 263 in December rose in January to 269 and to 275 inFebruary. Prices of British exports also continue to rise but less rapidly thanimport prices.Prices in the United States29. Commodity prices in the United States are increasing again. Moody&apos;sindex of staple commodity prices (31st December 1931 = 100) has risen from409 at 31st March to 420 at 12th April compared with 411 a year ago.YIIL-Wage Rates30. Changes in rates of wages which came into operation in Februaryresulted in an aggregate increase estimated at  125,000 in the weekly full-timewages of about 470,000 work people. The index numbers of wage rates in thetextiles, building, civil engineering and electrical installation industries rose by one point while the index for transport rose by two points. These increases were,however, not sufficient to affect significantly the overall index which remained at 104 (June 1947 = 100).31. During March arbitration awards were made or industrial agreementsconcluded involving wage increases in thirteen industrial groups and working hours were reduced or paid holidays extended in four industrial groups. Themost important wage increases were in the electricity supply, road passenger transport and hosiery industries.
