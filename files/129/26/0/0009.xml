(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)E&apos; C E E T------&quot; COPY NO.6th April^ I9h8.CABINETIRON AND STEEL SCRAPMemorandum by the Minister of Supply.On Iqth March I informed the Cabinet (CM. (1+8) 18thConclusions, Minute I4.)  that I had arranged for the scrap positionto be investigated by a Working Party of three under theChairmanship of Sir Graham Cunningham, formerly ControllerGeneral of Munitions Production in the Ministry of Supply.I asked for an early report on the German scrapsituation, which I hove now received,  and which I am circulatingas an Annex to this Paper.2. It will he seen that the main conclusions.,0..-(a) given the provision of technical assistance and additional equipment,  deliveries of booty scrapshould be increased to an annual rate of 50,000tons a month in 191+8, which, together With importsfrom other overseas sources and deliveries againstcontracts already placed for commercial scrap inGermany, will virtually meet the import requirementsof the 19U8 programme far the production of Id,000,000ingot tons of steel)(b) the placing of further contracts for substantial quantities of commercial scrap must await theintroduction of currency reform in Germany.3*       &apos; &apos;     The recommendations in the report were considered at ameeting of Ministry of Supply and Foreign Office officials heldon 23rd March.      I will deal seriatim,  in the light of theconclusions of that meeting, with the main questions of policyand action which arise.U&apos;* I felt uneasy at the suggestion that it would be .impossible to place any further contracts for substantial quantities of commercial scrap until the introduction of currencyreform,  and,  in view of the risk of delay, I instructed therepresentatives of my Department to raise at the meeting thequestion whether special incentives should not be introduced nowto secure further contracts for commercial scrap without waiting for currency reform.      The considered .view of all those present was that such special incentives would be of dubious value at thepresent time and that they might only encourage potential sellersto hold on to their scrap even longer in the hopes of still moreinducements.      The&apos; contract for 100,000 tons referred to inparagraph 13 of the Report has recently been placed at an exportprice of  6.10.0.   per ton and deliveries are about to commence.The opinion was expressed at the meeting that if the Joint Export/Import Agency would approve the two other contracts mentioned in
the Report for 20,000 tons and 15,000 tans respectively at this price it should be possible to persuade German scrap merchantsto enter into additional contracts at the same price.      I am advised that the Joint Export/Import Agency, who,  as explained in paragraph 19 of the Report, have hitherto shown reluctance to approve further contracts at  6.10.0. per ton, are nowinclined to consider this price a fair one,  and to approve thetwo contracts in question.      Efforts will be made to place furthercontracts with the German scrap merchants (i.e. without waiting for currency reform) and the position will be reviewed again inthe light of the success, or absence of success,  in the placing&apos;of such contracts.5* It is clear that, for the present, we must concentrate on securing the maximum deliveries of booty scrap.      The Committeewere generally well satisfied with the efficiency and enthusiasmof the existing organisations (the Disposals Group of the control commission for Germany,  and the Scrap Export Agency) who arehandling the problem.      The primary need is for further labour,equipment and technical assistance, as summarised in Appendix TVto the Report.6. As soon as the Committee returned from its visit toGermany ray Department arranged far experts from Messrs.  JackOlding and the British Oxygen Company to fly to Germany at short notice in order&quot;to advise on the repair etc.  of cranes and otherheavy equipment and on oxyacetylene cutting.      The total requirements of the programme have been reviewed with theseexperts.      During the lest few days the Ruston Bucyrus company have also sent out their experts to inspect Crawler cranes &quot;built by them, but the report of these experts is not yet available.7. In my view it is of essential importance that theadditional equipment required should be made available as amatter of the first urgency.      It&apos; will be needed both to dealwith the less accessible booty scrap which will henceforward haveto be moved and,  at a later stage,  with the large tonnages ofcommercial scrap which we hope will come forward.8. The main requirements (which comprise the needs of theDisarmament Branch and the Reparations, Deliveries and RestitutionDivision of the Control Commission for Germany as well ss theDisposals Group) are:-Tractors Glass I 80Tractors Class III  (or IV) 15/7 ton mobile crane h-0Crawler cranes (3/8 - 3/h yards) 175Crawler crane (20 ton) 1Railway crane standard gauge (20/30 tons) 1Heavy rooters 25500 Cubic feet compressor 1Oxyacetylene cutters U-00Gas cylinders 3*000Ten-ton trucks 300Light vehicles 30Protective clothing       - quantities unspecified.The Control Commission for Germany have been asked to put into theMinistry of Supply a formal consolidated demand covering these requirements and to indicate to what extent they can be met fromsupplies already available -to the Commission.9. To secure the most effective and expeditious supplyof this equipment:-
(a) I propose that one officer in the Ministry of Supplyshall be responsible for co-ordinating all arrangements in connection with the acquisition,  transport,  repair,etc.  of equipment to be obtained from this country.A single officer should be appointed in Germany who would co-ordinate all arrangements in connection with the materials to be obtained from Germany itself, would maintain close liaison throughout with the Ministry ofSupply representative,  and would organise the receiptand allocation within Germany of all the additional&quot;equipment made available:(b) A direction should be issued,  on Cabinet authority, toall Government Departments concerned drawing attentionto the urgent requirements of the German scrap programme,including the items summarised in paragraph 8, and suchothers as may be found to be necessary,  emphasisingthat these must be regarded as of the first priority,and asking that immediate steps should be token to give up as surplus  (or to make available on loan in caseswhere complete surrender is considered impossible) anyequipment within the classes needed which is not being put to immediate productive use.      I am hopeful that theB.A.O.R.  will be able to release equipment originallyheld for special tasks which are now largely completed;and I hope that, with the curtailment in capitalconstruction here, the Ministry of Works may be able togive up some mobile crones.      Obviously it will bedesirable to secure as much of the equipment as possible from within Germany itself.The War Office should also be asked to make available the seaplane hangar at Kiel which is considered by the experts sent out by Messrs.  Jack Oldihg to be eminentlysuitable for the work of stripping and reconditioningthe heavy equipment obtained from the B.A.O.R.  or other sources in Germany.10. I recommend that these directives should be issuedimmediately and that Departments should, be asked to make anydeclarations within one month so that it -will then be known whatbalance will bo unobtainable from stocks.      I would then have areport on the position circulated to the Cabinet.      I have already arranged to keep back from ordinary disposal any surplus materialalready in possession of the Ministry of Supply which would bosuitable for the needs of the German scrap programme.11. - The recommendations in the report concerning labour are inhand.      The Scrap Export Agency is actively recruiting additional staff, while the Control Commission ore urgently considering what can be done to improve the German labour position.      At present, forexample, German labour is largely untrained in the efficient use ofoxygen and cutting equipment.      To improve output and to assistgenerally in measures to ensure the more effective use of available resources for cutting operations I propose to ask the BritishOxygen Company to release one of their experts for attachment tothe Scrap Export Agency in Germany for a limited period,  soy threemont hs.12. paragraph 23 of the Committee&apos;s Report recommends thatan aonroach should be made to the .United States authorities in washington in order to ovoid cross-hauls of German scrap to the UnitedStates, and finished steel exports from the United States to theUnited Kingdom.      I do not think that it would be wise to ma tee suchan aoproach.      It might give rise to an embarrassing tu quoqueargument on the part of the Americans to the effect that the same
considerations would apply to the outflow of steel experts fromthe United Kingdom at a time /when we were receiving steel fromthe United States en European Recovery Programme terms.Moreover, on balance I believe that we are likely to gain ifthe United States authorities in Germany have a direct interest in securing the maximum tonnages of commercial scrapsupplies from that country.1 3 * I recommend:-(a) that we should continue to place contracts for commercial scrap in Germany wherever possiblethrough the Scrap Export Agency in the ordinary way.      The position should,  however, be reviewed at the end of May at the latest in the light ofthe successes achieved,  and of the prospects atthat time of an early introduction of currencyreform in Germany;(b) that the prevision of additional equipment for the recovery of booty scrap should be recognised asbeing of the first importance and that an immediatedirective should be issued to all GovernmentDepartments concerned on the lines proposed inparagraph 9(b) above;(c)    that no action should bo taken in the matter of approach to the United States Government    as recommended in paragraph 23 of the Committee&apos;sReport.anG.R.

SECRET Copy No.    gSCRAP INVESTIGATION COMMITTEE FIRST INTERIM REPORTScrap from GermanyComposition and Terms of reference . The Scrap Investigation Committee, which was set up by the Ministerof Supply on the instructions of the Cabinet, is composed of the following : Chairman : Sir Graham Cunningham, K.B.E., LL.B.Members : Lieut.-General Sir Kenneth Loch, K.C.I.E., C.B., M.C.Dr. R. E. Slade, M.C., D.Sc, F.R.I.C.Secretary : Mr. A. F. Barnes, Principal Assistant Secretary, Iron andSteel Board (Ministry of Supply).2.   The Committee&apos;s terms of reference are : (1) To prepare a report on the problem of securing adequate supplies of scrap for the United Kingdom iron and steel industry both in 1948and in subsequent years.(2) To consider to what extent the Royal Dockyards should be used for ship-breaking.3. The announcement of the formation of this Committee was made toParliament on Monday. 8th March, 1948.   (See Hansard, cols. 778-9.)4. The Prime Minister expressed the wish that the Committee should con-concentrate their attention in the first instance on the availability of scrap fromGermany, with a view to making an interim report on that subject by the endof March. Accordingly, the Chairman and Dr. Slade, accompanied by the Secre-tary and Mr. R. H. W. Bullock, Assistant Principal, Ministry of Supply, visitedGermany from Thursday, 11th, to Sunday, 14th March, 1948; the present report is based on their findings during that visit. A record of the places visited andof meetings held with various people is attached as Appendix I.5. When the Committee began to consider how they should proceed inrelation to their special terms of reference, it became apparent to them that theground had already been largely covered by earlier visits by Ministers, officials and Missions. A list of the visits of which the Committee became aware is given as Appendix II.Nature of the Problem6. The general problem can be most simply presented in the form of thesubjoined table, which is reproduced from Appendix A to the memorandum onthe Collection of Iron and Steel Scrap, submitted by the Iron and Steel Board tothe Minister on 23rd February, 1948 (see Appendix III).Provisional Estimates of Scrap Requirements for Steel-making in the UnitedKingdom and Home Supplies, 1948-1952(000 tons)	Assumed						Balance	production of	Scrap	Cir-			Total	to beYear	steel ingots	Require-	circulating	Process	Capital	3, 4	met by	and castings	msnts				and 5	import	(1)	(2)	(3)	(4)	(5)	(6)	(7)1948 ...	14,000	8,290	3,780	1,880	1,850	7,510	7801949 ...	14,500	8,380	3,840	1,940	1,550	7,330	1,0501950 ...	15,000	S.400	3,900	1,990	1,550	7,440	9601951 ...	15,500	8,490	3,950	2,050	1,700	7,700	7901952 ...	16,000	S,130	4,000	2,100	2,000	8,100	3035165 B
The figures in column (2) of the above table are directly related to those in column (1); the figures in columns (3) and (4) are also conditioned by those in column (1). The figures in columns (5) and (7), however, vary, independently ofthose in column (1).7. Column (7) the balance of the scrap requirement in each of the yearsmentioned to be met by import relates to the specific problem at present under examination in this Interim Report. The critical figure for the year 1948 is780,000 tons. The import requirement in 1949 will be even larger than in 1948,as indeed will also be the corresponding figures in 1950 and 1951, although byprogressively smaller margins. The Committee have in this interim report con-sidered primarily the requirements of 1948-49, while bearing in mind the con-tinuing though diminishing needs in subsequent years.8. Of the import requirement for 1948, the Committee have assumed that,on a conservative basis, at least 100,000 tons will be forthcoming from sourcesoutside Germany (see paragraph 11 of Appendix III); the outstanding balanceto be obtained from Germany is thus reduced to 680,000 tons. The main sources of scrap obtainable in Germany are Booty Scrap and Commercial Scrap.Booty Scrap9. Booty Scrap consists of scrap from enemy military stores, plant from warfactories and other warlike material, which is regarded as the property of the occupying Power. There is, however, always the possibility that political objec-tions may be raised to the dismantlement of factories and destruction of plantwhich have been designated as booty, and to the continued removal of the resultantscrap. It must also be recognised that claims may, at any time, be put forward that sources of scrap hitherto treated as &apos;&apos; booty &apos;&apos; should in the future bedealt with otherwise. Moreover, there are other allied European countries who might claim a share of this scrap. The Committee therefore urge that every effort should be made to speed up the removal and shipment of all available booty scrapwhile we have the opportunity. It is particularly important that as much aspossible should be removed in 1948, and the balance early in 1949, since substantial quantities of commercial scrap are not likely to be forthcoming until 1949 (seeparagraph 12 et seq., below). It is also particularly desirable to avoid makingpublic, either in political speeches or otherwise, any reference to the fact that weare relying on booty scrap, or the quantities we hope to obtain from that source.10. The collection and delivery of booty scrap can be accelerated if addi-tional labour, technical supervising staff, equipment and transport are provided.The Committee have been furnished by Mr. P. D. MacFeat, Chief of the DisposalsGroup of the Economic Sub-Commission of the C.C.G., with a statement of esti-mated requirements under these heads. The statement is given as Appendix IV.The Committee consider that all possible steps should be taken forthwith withinthe limits of available resources, to meet these requirements, and that applicationsfor the allocation of vehicles, plant and equipment for use on this work in germany should be accorded the highest possible priority.(Note. Since this report was drafted, arrangements have been made, withthe approval of the Minister of Supply, to send to Germany representa-tives from Messrs. Jack Olding, Ltd., and the British Oxygen Co., Ltd.,to examine the matters raised in paragraph 3 of Appendix IV.)11. If these additional facilities are in the main quickly provided, it is esti-mated that the monthly shipments of booty scrap could be raised from 40,000 to50,000 tons per month (say, 500,000-600,000 tons per annum). Without these facilities the monthly tonnage will fall off. With these facilities the outstandingbalance for 1948 may be expected to be reduced from 680,000 tons to, say, 80,000-180,000 tons.Commercial Scrap12. Commercial scrap has to be purchased, either through German scrap merchants or direct from the actual owners. It comprises, in addition to thenormal arisings from German industry, vast quantities of ferrous scrap resultingfrom bomb damage.13. The contract placed with the German Scrap Merchants&apos; Association lastyear for 100,000 tons has now been accepted by a German scrap merchant
(&quot; Selig &quot;) and deliveries are about to commence. Two other contracts, one for20,000 tons with Simmer and one for 15,000 tons with Geist, are we hope on thepoint of acceptance. If these are implemented during the next few months theywill add another 135,000 tons to 1948 deliveries. Thus the 1948 requirementwould be virtually covered. It is not likely that any further contracts will beaccepted for a large tonnage until currency reform has been effected (see below).14. During 1948, however, stocks of scrap will need to be built up in theUnited Kingdom in order to meet the increased requirements of 1949 and com-compensate for any falling-off in the yield of capital scrap from home sources andthe termination in 1949 of deliveries of booty scrap. In 1949 reliance must beplaced mainly on imports of commercial scrap from Germany. Any surplus,therefore, in excess of the 1948 import target of 600,000 for booty scrap will beof material help in tiding over the transition period in 1949 before commercialdeliveries attain substantial dimensions.15. The main contracts for commercial scrap now in operation provide for delivery in 1948 at the price of  6 10s. per ton f .a.s. The proceeds of export salesare paid in sterling to the Joint Export-Import Agency for the benefit of theGerman economy. The scrap merchant receives the internal controlled price of40-47 marks per ton (say, 45 marks) in a currency which has no external exchange value.As a measure of what this price means in terms of goods it is enough to saythat cigarettes (a well-recognised form of currency in Germany) are valued at marks each; thus the scrap merchant receives for 1 ton of steel scrap the equiva-lent of nine cigarettes ! The sterling payment of  6 10s. goes to the Joint Export-Import Agency. While this state of affairs exists, it is little wonder that thescrap merchant is reluctant to part with a valuable capital asset which does notdeteriorate and costs next to nothing to keep in stock.16. As an incentive to selling for export, the foreign currency bonus of 10per cent, of the payment to the J.E.I.A. has now been extended to iron and steelscrap. This bonus is made available 5 per cent, for the purchase of imports to benefit German labour and 5 per cent, to the exporter to purchase raw materials,equipment, &amp;o, needed for his industrial operations.(Note. It is an inducement to labour similar to this that is in contem-contemplation in paragraph 7 of Appendix IV.)17. In this connection, attention can usefully be drawn to paragraph 11 of appendix B to Appendix III a report made by the Committee&apos;s Secretary,Mr. Barnes, in consequence of a previous visit to Germany, earlier in the year.The Committee found complete agreement in Germany with the conclusions set outin this paragraph, and indeed some of these recommendations have already been acted on.18. Apart from the foreign currency bonus, there is at present no induce-ment to the German scrap merchant to sell his scrap; he prefers to keep his money in the form of capital goods until such time as the currency is reformed and con-trolled prices are related to the real value of the mark. There is no likelihood,as far as the Committee were able to ascertain, that currency reform will becompleted in less than three to four months. The prospect of placing new contracts for substantial exports of scrap before July-August 1948 is conse-quently very remote. Nevertheless, it is very desirable that facilities (bothtransport and equipment) should be provided in advance for handling much largershipments of scrap, when once the currency is reformed and deliveries begin tocome forward from new contracts. Any equipment and facilities obtained asa result of the recommendations in paragraph 10 above for the handling of booty scrap could, as the flow of booty scrap diminishes, be used to assist the fulfilment of future commercial contracts.19. Any small contracts which can be negotiated in the interim period beforethe currency is reformed should be pressed forward; the Committee understands,however, that the Joint Export-Import Agency do not favour any furthercontracts for scrap at the present price of  6 10s. per ton f .a.s. German port, since they consider this price to be too low in relation to the Pittsburgh price (the nearestapproach to a world price under existing trade conditions) after making allow-ance for shipping and other costs. Whether that is so or not should be dealt withnow, so as to clear the decks as far as possible, while time is available.35165 b 2
20. It is considered that, once the currency is reformed and certain otherremedial measures taken, it should be possible for contracts to be placed fordeliveries of scrap of the order of 80,000 tons per month; deliveries should buildup to a peak early in 1949, when supplies of booty scrap will tend to decline.Deliveries of commercial scrap at the rate of 80,000 tons per month, together withthe residue of booty scrap, scrap imported from sources other than Germany, anddrawings on United Kingdom stocks built up from surplus imports of booty scrap &quot;)in 1948 should amply cover the import requirements of the peak year 1949, andthe diminishing requirements of the following years.21. It is doubtful, however, whether there will be enough labour and adequate port facilities handling equipment and transport to deal with much, if anything, over an inclusive total monthly export of 80,000 tons. This matter should be examined forthwith. Even if 80,000 tons were the peak, the 1949requirements should be substantially provided for, but to maintain a peak out-put is asking for the impossible. This makes it all the more important to enquire into this aspect, and to provide all necessary equipment meanwhile so as to buildup stocks in this country.(Note. With currency reform trade to and from Germany might be con-siderably increased. This will have obvious repercussions on transport facilities.)The American Aspect22. There are certain other claimants on supplies of scrap from Germany,notably the United States. It is, however, reasonably clear that the potentialreserves of scrap in Germany are adequate, after fulfilling the immediate needs ofthe German steel industry, to satisfy the legitimate import requirements of othersteel-producing countries during the next two or three years, with the possible exception of those of the United States. This conclusion is not fully accepted bythe leaders of the German scrap merchants&apos; organisation, nor by some Americanmembers of the Bipartite Control. Sir John Duncanson&apos;s memorandum (at appendix V) demonstrates conclusively, however, that the German steel industryneed make no call at all on German scrap reserves beyond the stock piles already in scrap merchants&apos; yards and normal arisings from industry.23. In considering the possible competition of American claims, the Com-mittee consider that it would be illogical and uneconomic to ship scrap to theUnited States for conversion into steel, and then to ship back to the UnitedKingdom the finished steel under &quot;Marshall Aid.&quot; By meeting to the efullest extent the scrap requirements of the British steel industry from Germany, theamount of aid needed by Great Britain, in the form of finished steel, would be correspondingly reduced. Mr. Wilkinson, the United States Director of economics, agrees with this view, but the Committee were informed that his view is not shared by his colleagues. It was thought in Germany by the British officialswith whom this matter was discussed that it was important to get the UnitedStates authorities in Washington at ambassadorial level of the same way ofthinking as Mr. Wilkinson before a major decision on policy is taken by thePresident. It might be difficult, if not impossible, to get such a decision on policyaltered when once given. Inasmuch as a United States Mission have just pub-lished the report on their findings arising out of a recent visit to Germany, thismatter is considered to be of great importance and urgency.24. It is understood that there are upwards of 270,000 tons of booty scrapin the United States Zone not yet touched by the American authorities. It isrumoured that the Americans are considering handing this over to the Germansas a gesture to be used as part of the German economy. If this were done,it should help His Majesty&apos;s Government in arguing with the United states authorities that they have no urgent claim to a share in German commercialscrap (for which they must pay) if they give away booty scrap (which they getfor nothing).Recommendations25.   The Committee&apos;s recommendations may be summarised as follows :_(i) All possible steps should be taken to speed up immediately deliveries ofbooty scrap.(ii) The placing of further commercial contracts for substantial quantitiesof scrap must await currency reform.
(iii) After currency reform commercial scrap deliveries should be scheduledto start on an appreciable scale towards the end of 1948, building upto a peak during 1949, and thereafter diminishing in step with import requirements.The adoption of these recommendations may give the following results during1948 :-Assuming Import requirements of (paragraph 6) ...To be met from sources other than Germany (para-graph 8)     ..................German tonnage neededBooty scrap (paragraph 11) sayStill leaving a requirement of ...Commercial scrap contracts (see paragraph 13)Giving a balance ofCommercial scrap after currency reform, say threemonths at 30,000 per monthTons780,000100,000680,000550,000130,000135,000+   5,00090,0004- 95,000 to build upstocks in U.K.for 194926. The Committee wish to place on record their opinion that within the limitations imposed by policy and shortage of equipment and labour, the existing organisations dealing with the removal of booty scrap (viz., Disposals Group,C.C.G., and Scrap Export Agency, Iron and Steel Disposals Ltd.), have achievedvery commendable results and appear to be working smoothly and enthusiastically.(Note. This report is confined to German scrap, but meanwhile,General Loch, the member of the Committee who did not visit Germany,made visits to War Office and Air Ministry officials, and his findingswill be embodied in a subsequent report.)(Signed) G.

Iron and steel scrap for use in the production of steel ingots and castingsmay come forward in one or other of the following ways :  (a) Arisings from within the iron and steel industry, i.e., from the steelworks, blast furnaces, iron foundries, &amp;c.(b) Purchased scrap acquired by scrap merchants from industrial under -takings and private sources or acquired by steel works themselvesdirect from such undertakings.(c) Surplus Government iron and steel equipment and material.(d) Imported scrap.
2. Arisings from the iron and steel industry (&quot;circulating scrap&quot;) areretained for use at the furnaces where they originate and are not handled bythe scrap merchants.3. Purchased scrap may be new or production scrap, that is, scrap arisingfrom all methods of production or old or capital scrap, that is, iron and steelarising from the scrapping of obsolete and redundant machinery, ships, plant and structures of all kinds.New or production scrap is related to output and varies only according tothe consumption of iron and steel in manufacturing operations. No appreciableincrease of supplies of scrap from this source will result from appeals to industrybecause it is essential to the efficient conduct of operations that such scrap beregularly cleared. Old or capital scrap may vary dependent upon such factors as (a) The period of delivery and price of new machinery and plant for replacement.(b) Difficulty in securing licences for buildings and civil engineering workrelated to new machinery and plant.(c) Inertia on the part of holders.4. Some 2,000 scrap merchants are responsible for the bulk of the collectionof scrap arising in all fields of industry in the form of production scrap, e.g.,turnings, borings, effects, &amp;o. and from redundant plant, machinery, structures,vehicles, &amp;c. The collection of scrap, the breakdown of plant, vehicles,&amp;o, the demolition of steel structures and the general sorting and preperation of scrap into grades and sizes appropriate to the various consumers,is a highly specialised business. There are a number of merchants in a smallway of business, who resell parcels of scrap to larger merchants possessing specialplant necessary for its treatment before remelting. These smaller merchants areuseful agents for the collection of parcels which are too small or too isolated to attract the larger dealers.5. A specialised source of scrap handled by scrap merchants is that derivedfrom the breaking up of ships.. This work is undertaken by firms who specialisein this trade and who sell the bulk of the resultant scrap direct to steel works and foundries. Ships for breaking up are acquired by the British Iron and steel corporation (Salvage) Ltd., (an agency company of the Iron and Steel Board)who allocate them to the various ship-breaking firms according to the size of theship and the berths available. The work is carried out by the ship-breaking firmsunder contract.6. Scrap arising from surplus Government stores is largely a temporarysource of supply and is already declining.The disposal of surplus Government iron and steel in all forms is dealt withby &quot; Iron and Steel Disposals Ltd.&quot; an agency company of the Iron andSteel Board.Surplus Government iron and steel is handed over to the Company without charge; the Company meets its expenses from the proceeds of sales and thebalance is paid over to the Ministry of Supply. The Company has also powerto buy surplus material from private owners but except in the case of purchases of commercial scrap in Germany this power is used only in very exceptional circumstances. Close control is exercised by the Iron and Steel Board over thepolicy and actions of the Company.Wherever possible scrap is sold direct to users. Scrap of a size or natureunsuitable for direct sale to the smelter is sold to scrap merchants who sort it,cut it to size, &amp;c, and sell to steel works and foundries.7. The Iron and Steel Board exercises general oversight of the whole scrapsituation and keeps in close touch with all measures being taken by the industryand itself initiates action where deemed advisable. One of the senior officials of the Iron and Steel Board is charged with the responsibility for the supervision of scrap supplies and valuable assistance is obtained from the Board&apos;s adviser onscrap, Mr. Seeker, Assistant Managing Director of T. W. Ward &amp; Co., Ltd.,and Director of Scrap in the Iron and Steel Control throughout the war.8. The estimated requirement of scrap for steel making in this country overthe next few years at certain assumed levels of steel ingot and pig iron production as compared with the estimated home supply of scrap and the balance to be made
good by import from abroad is shown in Appendix A. These long-range estimates have necessarily to be regarded with reserve, particularly in such a field as scrapsupplies. But they are based upon past experience and allowance for such factors as the fluctuation in Capital Scrap according to assumed ability to renew plant,the effect of all possible pressure on scrap holders, the reducing yield of circulatingscrap as the proportion of flat rolled products increases, and some little fall inthe index of total materials in steel making as newer plants come in.From this it will be seen that the scrap import requirement to maintainthese levels of steel production (and without any allowance for stock build)diminishes from a peak of about 1 million tons in 1949 until it disappears in1952 by which date it is planned that increased pig iron production will leavethe industry independent of imported scrap at a 16 million ton level of steel production. As stated these figures do not allow of any significant stock buildand it would, given particularly favourable conditions in other respects, be technically possible to produce a little more steel from the existing meltingcapacity if more scrap was available.9. Prior to the war there was little difficulty in importing scrap to meetthe then requirements of steel production, the principal source being America.But since the war the abnormal demand for steel and the widespread efforts to increase production have led to a world-wide shortage of scrap in steel-producing countries (outside Germany). The United States has itself become a buyer of scrap on account of increased production and diminishing reserves of rich bearingiron ore for pig iron production. There is no present prospect of America againbecoming an exporter of scrap and with the exception of certain &quot; pockets ofscra,p (largely deriving from the war) which will be referred to hereafter thereis no major source of import outside Germany.10. The position in Germany is abnormal. Steel production is far belowthe pre-war level and there is a vast accumulation of scrap in the way of war-likestores and war damaged property, plant and equipment. It is estimated thatat least 5 million tons and probably more must be available in Western Germany.The Iron and Steel Board and the Control Commission have been able to makesatisfactory arrangements for the collection, sorting, cutting and shipping of&quot; booty scrap &quot; (i.e., scrap from war-like material) from Germany to this country.This is effected through two organisations; one operated by the Commission for collecting this scrap and one operated by the Board for its receipt, sorting and shipping. These shipments are now at the rate of over 40,000 tons a month andshould rise to 50,000 tons provided suitable labour and transport is madeavailable and the Board is seeking to make arrangements to replace transportnow in danger of being diverted to other essential uses in Germany. The supplyof this type of scrap is limited but it is hoped to obtain 500,000 tons in 1948 andprobably about half that quantity in 1949 which will go far to exhaust the supply as at present estimated.The bulk of the available scrap in Germany is of the so-called &apos;&apos; Commercial &apos;&apos;category, i.e., it has to be purchased. Here the position is far from satisfactory.Despite the utmost and sustained pressure by the Board and the Minister theForeign Office and the Control Commission have, so far, been unable to procuremore than an insignificant trickle from the vast quantity available. Many visitshave been paid to Germany by representatives of the Board and the federation and a copy of a recent report by one of the Board&apos;s senior officials following a visit to obtain the most up-to-date information on the situation is attached as appendix B. This has been sent to the Foreign Office with reiterated representa-tions as to the urgency of obtaining substantial quantities of scrap and theBoard&apos;s continued anxiety in the matter. It will be seen that for a variety of reasons set out in the Report all negotiations to place contracts with Germanmerchants for the export of large quantities of scrap have broken down. an american mission has just concluded a tour of Germany with the object ofobtaining scrap for United States and is about to issue a report. It may be thatthis will result in joint action by the American and British authorities to break the present deadlock with the Germans whether by the provision of incentives nowlacking or otherwise. The problem is essentially a political one and as suchoutside the jurisdiction of the Board.Under the aegis of the European Economic Commission it has been decided tosend a surveying party representing various countries to Germany, North africa and elsewhere with a view to assessing scrap availability and its collection onbehalf of these countries. It is to be hoped that this will not be made the excuse for further delay or result in disturbing the present supply of &apos;&apos; booty scrap &apos;&apos; or
even reduce whatever prospects this country may have of obtaining the bulk ofthe commercial scrap.11. Other possible sources of supply of imported scrap are the Middle East,Iraq, Malta, North Africa, Singapore and other British colonies.As regards Egypt and the Middle East the Board has maintained close touchwith the Director-General of Disposals at Cairo. There is a significant quantityof British owned scrap in Egypt and it is hoped to secure up to 150,000 tons fromthat country provided the present political difficulties can be overcome. TheEgyptian Government has placed a virtual embargo on the export of this scrappending agreement upon the quantity to be retained for disposal in that country.Negotiations are proceeding now.In Iraq about 35,000 tons is in process of being acquired for shipment.There are prospects of obtaining scrap from sunken vessels at Malta andalong the coast of North Africa and arrangements to this end are in train.Attempts to collect scrap in the Western Desert had to be abandoned owing to lossof life through uncharted mine fields and booby traps.Small quantities ranging from a few hundred to 20,000 tons may be forth-coming from Singapore and other colonies.All these sources will be substantially non-recurring.12. At home the normal sources of supply have been augmented by thescrapping of surplus war material. But even so, rising steel production has eateninto stocks of scrap because of two reasons first the failure to obtain commercialscrap from Germany and second the inability to increase pig-iron productionfurther than was done in 1947 because of the shortage of coke. In these circum-stances action was taken to increase the home supply of scrap to the practicablemaximum.A special appeal was made to industrial undertakings in November last bythe British Iron and Steel Federation, the Federation of British Industries andother trade organisations urging them to throw up for scrap old plant and other material for which there was unlikely to be any further use. This was reinforced by a personal approach to the chairman of leading industrial companies and headsof other institutions. A similar appeal was made by the Board to the service departments and other Government bodies and departments controlling steel-usingestablishments or undertakings to take measures to ensure that all iron and steelmaterial that could be declared surplus to requirements was made available for use as scrap. The Scrap Merchants&apos; Association urged upon their members the need to place the utmost energy behind the scrap drive.13. It is too early to form a firm conclusion as to the probable outcome of the appeal to industry throughout the whole of this year but judged by the returnsover the past three months the response is satisfactory. The weekly average of receipts of &quot; bought scrap &quot; in December and January as compared with those for the corresponding periods in the last two years are as follows : Thousand TonsDecember 1945 ... 66-3 December 1946 ... 66-0 December 1947 ... 75-1January 1946   ... 68-8   January 1947   ... 67-1   January 1948   ... 82-2The total receipts of scrap in January from all sources were above the averageneeded to meet the 14 million ton target.It has been suggested, however, that a far greater yield of-scrap would result if the price were raised above the present controlled level which is considerably below the corresponding level in America and on the Continent. For example,the highest price of first-class scrap delivered to steel works in this country isabout  5 a ton as compared with a price for a comparable product currentlyquoted of up to $50 a ton in Pittsburgh.This is a matter which has been considered by the Board from time to timeand the view of the Board&apos;s technical scrap experts is that the maximum additionalarisings which an increase of price would be likely to attract would not exceedabout 150,000 tons on a price increase of about 10s. a ton. Apart from its beingdoubtful whether an additional quantity of scrap of this order would, in effect,be obtained the adoption of this measure would entail the raising of scrap pricesgenerally so that the cost of obtaining 150,000 tons would be about  1,750,000,or 3s 3d. a billet ton of steel. It would, in the main result in increased profits toscrap merchants now engaged in collecting the great bulk of scrap finding its way35165 c
to the steel works. The Board did not consider that the heavy additional cost was justified in relation to the relatively small quantity involved. In any case wherethere is a significant quantity of scrap and where the holder considers the costof removal is not adequately covered by the existing price the industry, through theFederation, is prepared to make special arrangements to collect at its own cost.14. It has also to be remembered that the scrap derived as a result of appealsto industry is mainly of the non-recurring type and does not consist to any appreciable extent of &quot;the normal arisings from production. Thus once the barrelhas been scraped for discarded plant and material no substantial quantitiesbeyond those arising in the normal way can be expected from similar appealsmade at a later date. Thus such periodic appeals cannot provide a permanentremedy to the scrap problem, which can only be solved by opening up and developing an entirely new source of supply, e.g., Germany.15. The Board does not consider that there would be any advantage in anappeal to the nation to throw up increased supplies of household scrap, sincewartime experience shows that the light destructor material that would be forth-coming is of very limited use for steel manufacture and would hardly warrant the cost of collection.16. The practicability of collecting old farm implements and other obsoleteagricultural machinery is being energetically pursued by the British Iron andSteel Federation. The results of such enquiries as have been made suggest,however, that some of the estimates which have been put forward as to the amountof scrap likely to be obtained from this source are greatly exaggerated. Investiga-tion with the National Farmers&apos; Union showed that there are 110,000 farms ofove:&quot; 50 acres and it was not considered that there would on average be 1 ton of scrap on each farm. The Federation has provided  200,000 to conduct an experiment in the collection of rural scrap in Scotland.17. The Board has decided to call for a census of stocks in hands of scrap merchants in order to judge whether there is any evidence of holding back scrapby small firms against a possible increase in price or for other reasons.18. As regards Government-owned surplus material, it is understood that instructions have been issued by the various Government Departments concerned to their depots and industrial establishments to release all unwanted equipment and material. But it is not easy to obtain rapid results. There is great difficultyin determining what quantity of stores, both at home or abroad, should be retainedto cover future needs; even when articles are declared surplus there may be alag while efforts are made to dispose of them in their re-usable state; and theproblem is aggravated by incomplete records and diminishing personnel. Thiswould seem to be particularly the case with Army stores as it is thought thai;,at some Army depots there are substantial quantities of ferrous material still being unnecessarily retained.Arrangements have been made for a joint survey by officers of the Q.M.G.&apos;department and the Board&apos;s advisers of the large depots in this country. TheArmy Council have been asked to give early consideration to declaring surplusthe maximum quantity of iron and steel equipment.19. So far as the Navy is concerned the recently announced scrapping pro-gramme of Naval vessels will, together with ships obtained from other sources,provide our ship-breaking yards with sufficient work to absorb all availablecapacity during 1948 and 1949. The Board is investigating closely the possibilityof increasing ship-breaking capacity either by bringing into operation new yardsor by assisting ship-breakers to obtain additional equipment where this is shown to be necessary to enable them to expand the scope of their operations.20. Certain other sources of Government-owned scrap which presentpeculiar difficulties are being followed up, e.g., material from beach defences. Aproposal to recover the oil pipe-lines laid in this country during the war is underconsideration, but although the tonnage of pipes likely to be recovered would amount to something of the order of 70,000 tons, the bulk of this would be suitable for re-use and comparatively little would be handed over as scrap.21. No particular mention has been made of cast iron and other scraprequired for iron foundries, the annual consumption of which amounts to about1 - 3 million tons per annum and will rise to 1 - 5 million tons per annum over thenext few years. This is also watched by the Board, and though the difficulties are not so acute as with steel-making scrap these are tending to increase.
22. To sum up, the Board considers that there is little scope for any further action in this country for increasing the yield of scrap to any significant extentexcept in so far as increased pressure may be brought to bear on GovernmentDepartments and Organisations to accelerate the release of surplus material under their control. So far as industry is concerned it is doubtful whether there is any appreciable reservoir which has not yet been or is not in process of being tapped.Ship-breaking operations will be developed to their fullest extent, but it has tobe borne in mind that the maximum production of scrap from this source cannotbe expected to exceed 350,000 tons per annum and cannot therefore be regardedas a major source of supply. Inevitably any consideration of the scrap problemcomes back to the German position which is the key to the situation over the nextfew years and it is in this direction that strong and rapid action is needed. This,as already pointed out, is essentially a political issue and beyond the Board&apos;control.So far as the current situation is concerned it will be seen from Appendix That a production of 14 million tons of steel in 1948 is dependent upon importsof scrap of about 800,000 tons and it is hoped that 500,000 tons will be received as booty scrap from Germany and about 100,000 tons from other sources. Whilethe source looked to for the balance of 200,000 tons would be German commercialscrap it would be wrong to be misled into thinking that because of this relatively small quantity firm and urgent action is not as necessary as suggested in theGerman situation. Stocks of steel-making scrap at steel works in Great britain are about 350,000 tons and it is desirable to increase these as soon as possible, notonly to expand the margin but to prepare for a higher level of steel output.Besides, larger quantities of imported scrap are required in 1949, 1950 and 1951when booty scrap and windfalls in the Middle East and elsewhere will have been exhausted. It is vital to the hope of raising steel production to higher levels in1949 that a substantial flow of German commercial scrap should be obtained as early this year as possible.Moreover, some authorities consider the projected yield of process and capital scrap at home to be over-estimated and it must be accepted that there isroom for a wide margin of error in this field. The Board&apos;s own advisers are nowexamining the estimates in detail and these are subject to adjustment in that respect also.23rd February, 1948.Appendix a provisional Estimates of Scrap Requirements and Home Supplies, 1948-52(000 tons)Year	Assumed production of steel ingots and castings	Scrap Require-ment	Scrap available from Home Sources				Balance to be met by import			Cir-circulating	Process	Capital	Total	1948 ...	14,000	8,290	3,780	1,880	1,850	7,510	7801949 ...	14,500	8,380	3,840	1,940	1,550	7,330	1,0501950 ...	15,000	8,400	3,900	1,990	1,550	7,440	9601951 ...	15,500	8,490	3,950	2,050	1,700	7,700	7901952 ...	16,000	8,130	4,000	2,100	2,000	8,100	30Appendix BIRON AND STEEL SCRAPReport on &quot;Visit to Germany(2nd-6th February, 1948)I. Object of Visit1. The purpose of my visit was to obtain first-hand information on behalfof the Iron and Steel Board as to the prospects of obtaining increased suppliesof iron and steel scrap from all available sources in Germany.35165 c 2
2. My enquiries were directed in the first instance to ascertaining howmatters stood in relation to the agreement reached with Dr. Muller, the chiefrepresentative of the German steel producers and scrap merchants, for the delivery to the United Kingdom of 100,000 tons of heavy steel scrap in the first quarter of 1948, and what were the prospects of long-term plans for the supplyof scrap in much larger quantities. I discussed these matters in the first instanceat Frankfurt with Mr. Tregoning, the Deputy Chairman (British) of the Industryand Commerce Group of the Bipartite Control and with the British and american representatives of the Joint Export and Import Agency. Subsequently, atDiisseldorf I had further discussions with the officers of the Bipartite Controlattached to the Metallurgical Industries Division of the Industry and CommerceGroup. I also had an opportunity at Dusseldorf of being present at a general discussion with Dr. Muller and representatives of the German scrap merchantsduring the course of which the difficulties from the German standpoint of supply -ing scrap for export were forcibly stated.3. I then went on to Hamburg where I discussed with Mr. McFeat, the Headof the Disposals Group of the Control Commission, and with Colonel Hopkinson,Head of the Ministry of Supply Scrap Export Agency, the progress that wasbeing made in the recovery of booty scrap. I also had a meeting with CaptainMackenzie, the Head of the Salvage Branch of the Control Commission, who is incharge of the salvage and ship-breaking operations on booty ships and commercialvessels handed over for scrapping.4.   An itinerary of my visit is set out in detail in the Appendix to this report.II. Commercial Scrap5. From the talks at Frankfurt it became apparent that no progress hadbeen made to implement the agreement reached with Dr. Muller for the placing of a contract for 100,000 tons of heavy steel scrap for export to the UnitedKingdom during the first quarter of 1948. Colonel Hopkinson, the Head of theMinistry of Supply Scrap Export Agency, informed me later, however, on myarrival at Hamburg, that he was satisfied, as the result of his talks at Dusseldorfwith Dr. Muller and the German scrap merchants, that the latter were quite prepared to enter into firm contracts for the export of 50,000 tons of scrap duringthis period. The view had been taken both at Frankfurt and in London that itmight prejudice the general negotiations which the Control Commission wereconducting if an offer to supply this reduced quantity was accepted.6. Various reasons were attributed by the representatives of the BipartiteControl and of the Joint Export and Import Agency on the one hand, and byDr. Muller and the German scrap merchants themselves on the other, to explain the breakdown of negotiations.   These may be summarised as follows : (a) The scrap merchant had at present no inducement to sell for export as,whatever the export price paid in a foreign currency, he would onlyreceive the controlled internal price of 43 Reichsmarks per ton. Theleading merchants were in any case dissatisfied with the export price that had been offered by the United Kingdom since, although therewas no provision at the moment which would enable the Germanexporter of scrap to acquire any share in the foreign currency receivedfrom export sales, they considered that, in the interest of the german economy, the export price should be based on the world price for scrap.(b) According to Dr. Muller, there was not in any case at the present time a surplus of scrap available for export. On the basis of an estimatedproduction of steel during 1948 of 5 million tons (55 per cent, openhearth, 45 per cent. Thomas) the scrap requirements are assessed at,100,000 tons. 1 million tons would be available from the the steelworks themselves, leaving 1,100,000 tons to be collected and processedby the scrap merchants. Of this quantity, 400,000 tons would be derived from new production at engineering works, leaving 700,000tons to be collected from the 4-5 millions of old scrap in blitzed citiesand industrial works. There were at present stocks amounting to500,000 tons at steel works and 120,000 tons at blast furnaces, but these would need to be replaced from deliveries from scrap merchants&apos;stocks in scrap yards which had been reduced by 300,000 tons sincethe beginning of 1947.
When, however, steel production in Germany gets back on to a normal basis, the deficiency on a 6 million ingot steel production wouldbe reduced, according to figures produced by Dr. Muller, to 180,000 tons per annum.(c) It was asserted by Dr. Muller that, scrap dealers had lost money on recenttransactions in the home market and that prices would need to beraised very appreciably before there was any considerable increase inthe quantities of scrap coming forward. The merchants were making their profits not on scrap but on sales of re-usuable materials. Thescrap price should, he claimed, be between 40 per cent, and 50 percent, of the price of steel bars. The present basic price of steel barsis 119 Reichsmarks, so that on this basis the price of scrap should be approaching 60 marks instead of 43 marks as at present.(d) The scrap merchant had little interest in making any sales at all under present conditions, and was, in fact, selling the minimum quantitiesnecessary to satisfy the current requirements of the German iron andsteel industry and to keep his business going. Material goods, otherthan those which could be profitably disposed of on a barter basis,were being held back in the hope of realising better prices when thelong-awaited currency reform was introduced. Scrap steel did notlend itself to barter transactions so that the workers did not, as inmany manufacturing industries, receive additions to their wages inthe form of &quot; payment in kind.&quot;(e) Moreover, while the scrap merchant was disinclined to dispose of his existing stocks, the low selling prices and the cost and physical diffi-culties of obtaining suitable labour, transport and equipment, acted as a deterrent against the collection, handling and processing of addi-tional supplies of scrap.Before the war scrap collections aggregated 200,000 tons. until recently they amounted to 70,000 tons a month but had now fallen to55,000 tons a month.(/) As regards labour, not only was there an actual shortage in numbersbut such labour as was available was relatively inefficient. At themeeting with Dr. Muller and the German scrap merchants it was statedthat the number of workers employed by scrap merchants in theDusseldorf area was 6,000 and that an additional 1,400 workers were needed. Application had been made to the Priority Boards for this additional number of workers to be allocated but owing to the relatively low priority accorded to the demands of the scrap industry, the appli-cation had been refused. (The procedure adopted by the PriorityBoards in making allocations of labour is being investigated by theControl Commission since there is some reason to doubt whetherapplications submitted to them are considered in the light of full information as to their urgency and importance to the german economy.)The work itself is not attractive and it is difficult to retain suitable labour.Scrap workers are not included in the &apos;&apos; heaviest&apos;&apos; class of labour for rations and tend to drift into industries such as mining where theworkers receive additional food. Efficiency of labour at present available is considered to be about 40 per cent, of the normal labour forthis class of work. Inadequate supplies of clothing, boots and shoesand gloves also militate against efficiency. Lack of food and clothingresult in increased absenteeism due to sickness.(g) Scrap merchants experience difficulty in acquiring sufficient tracks to cope with their transport requirements for the collection and delivery of scrap; indeed, it sometimes happens that trucks are taken from scrap merchants for other more urgent uses, e.g., transport of food.7. Various suggestions were put forward during the course of my visit as to measures which might be taken to facilitate the export of scrap.It was generally accepted that in theory the most effective remedy would be to requisition the material in the scrap yard and pay the merchants fair compen-sation. Dr. Muller himself admitted that confiscation should have been ordered by the Military Government when the trouble over export first arose. But by common consent the time for mandatory action of this sort had now passed.It was not thought there was the slightest hope that the Americans would enter-tain such a proposal since it would run counter to the general trend of policy
which was to delegate more and more control in the economic field to the germans themselves. Moreover the compulsory purchase of materials for export would bedeliberately misrepresented by the Russians as reparations from current produc-tion notwithstanding that proper compensation was paid to the owners. This wasthe view expressed by the American members of the J.E.I.A.8.   The course advocated by the American members of J.E.I.A. was : (a) Fix an export price based upon the world price of scrap. The method would be to take the price quoted for current delivery at Pittsburg asthe world price and adjust this price to f.a.s. German port. the americans had evidently not considered in detail what the deductionshould be to cover the cost of shipment from German port to Pittsburgbut seemed to think it would be in the region of $10. As the currentPittsburg quotations fluctuate around $40 the export price at Germanport on this basis would be about $30. Actually the cost of shipmentwould work out somewhat as follows : The resultant price f.a.s. German port would thus be about $15which would be a favourable quotation from our point of view, but notat all the kind of figure the Americans had in mind. If the sugges-tion of a formula based on the Pittsburg price is to be pursued it wouldbe necessary to arrive at some understanding with the Americans toensure that it would provide a fixed basis operative over a prescribed period and yield a resultant figure f .a.s. German port acceptable to the americans, the Germans and ourselves.(b) Include iron and steel scrap in the list of commodities to which the foreign currency bonus of 10 per cent, on the export price applies. This 10per cent, bonus is distributed, 5 per cent, to the Labour Fund, to beused for the purchase of imports to benefit German labour generally and 5 per cent, to be made available to the exporter to purchase rawmaterials, equipment, &amp;c, needed for his own industrial operations.The weakness of this proposal is that it does not provide theinducement to the labour employed by the scrap merchant, or to thesmaller scrap dealers who collect the scrap in the first instance andthen sell it, generally in an unprocessed condition to the larger scrap merchants. Nor does it get over the difficulty that the costs of collec-tion and handling and processing are excessive in relation to present prices and that the material is being held back for the expected risein internal prices when currency reform is introduced.9. Another suggested solution is to increase the controlled selling price of scrap as part of a scheme for raising prices generally in a number of industries(including the steel industry) which it is suggested should be introduced as from 1st April next with the Bi-Zonal Budget. Dr. Muller is of opinion thatan increase in scrap prices would do a great deal to stimulate the collection and disposal of scrap. Unless, however, an increase in price is followed by an increasein wages to scrap workers and by an increase in the quantity and variety of con-sumer goods offered for sale the difficulty of attracting labour to the scrapindustry will remain.10. A suggestion had been put forward in discussion in London that as an incentive the importation of foreign ore might be linked up with exports of scrap,so that the more scrap the Germans export the more ore they would be allowed to import. The suggestion was mentioned in discussion with the British membersof the J.E.I.A. at Frankfurt, but as we are already committed to Germany being allowed at least 1^ million tons of imported iron ore during 1948, and as it is very doubtful whether it would be possible to obtain more than this total for Germanythis year, it is not clear what form the incentive could take.11. The view most generally favoured is that no definite improvement in theexisting position can be expected until the German currency has been reformedDollarsLoading in GermanySea-freightCost of discharge American portInland freight in United States ...311-503-50826
and its exchange value with foreign currencies established. Pending the reform of the currency, some combination of the other proposed remedies would seem tooffer the best hope of ending the present deadlock. The following measuresappear the most promising :  (a) Fix the export price on the basis of the Pittsburg price.(6) Extend the foreign currency bonus provision to exports of iron and steelscrap.(c) Raise the controlled price of iron and steel scrap.(d) Classify scrap-workers as the &quot;heaviest&quot; workers for purposes of rations.(e) Provide increased facilities for transport; additional clothing, boots andgloves; necessary equipment for cutting.(/) Place labour for scrap industry in the highest priority class.12. The most hopeful sign in an otherwise somewhat gloomy situation isthat the United States Scrap Mission, which has recently carried out an investi-gation into the scrap position in Germany, appears to have reached the conclusionthat there are very considerable quantities which could be made available forexport and that measures, including the provision of incentives and any necessary equipment, and materials such as carbide, &amp;o, should be taken to promote a bigscrap export drive. While it would be necessary for the Bizonal authorities todecide as to the basis of allocation of scrap exports between steel-producing countries wishing to make purchases, and as to the basis on which the export price is to be negotiated, it will clearly be in the interest of the United Kingdom to giveits full support to any recommendations of the United States Scrap Mission forthe adoption of measures to stimulate the flow of exports.13. On a review of all the factors in the situation described above there appears to be little likelihood that any substantial quantities of commercial scrap certainly nothing approaching 1 million tons will be received in this country from Germany during 1948. The best we can hope for is the placing of contracts for the delivery of supplies in the second half of 1948, or, what is more probable,during 1949.III. Booty Scrap and Recovery of Scrap from German Ships14. Deliveries of booty scrap are being maintained at a level of 35,000 to40,000 tons a month but there is little prospect at present of reaching the target of 50,000 tons a month, still less of 60,000 tons a month which was at one timeregarded as possible of achievement although every effort is being made to increasethe output. Inability to reach these levels is due in the main to labour and trans-port troubles and to the hold-up of ship-breaking operations on German commercialvessels. Labour shortage is most pronounced in the Dusseldorf area due to theunattractiveness of this work as compared with other employment and to the relatively low priority accorded to it. Transport difficulties have arisen mainlyat Kiel and Wilhelmshaven. Scrap arisings from ship-breaking and dismantlingoperations at these ports are transported mainly by road and the deficiency oftrucks available for this traffic has been accentuated in recent weeks by the diversion of a number of trucks to convey consignments of paper to the Americanzone. Furthermore, there is a danger that the existing supply of trucks whichhas been allocated by the Disposals Group for the transport of scrap may be substantially reduced in the near future owing to the supply of surplus vehiclesbecoming exhausted and to the increasing demands on the Group to provide trucksfor convoy work.15. The labour position in the Hamburg region is reasonably satisfactoryat the moment. The G.C.L.U. Company which has been allocated by B.A.O.R. tothe Disposals Group for work on scrap will enable immediate labour requirements to be met and the provision of a midshift meal for direct and indirect labour employed on scrap recovery will result in an increase of efficiency.16. Pending agreement being reached with J.E.I.A. as to the export priceof scrap obtained from the breaking up of German commercial vessels, salvagework on these vessels has been temporarily suspended. Enquiries are being madewith a view to resumption of this work.17. The Admiralty have asked that a British Naval 350-ton crane at present used at Kiel on ship-salvaging operations should be brought back to this country.The Navy have agreed that the crane shall be allowed to remain at Kiel until
1(5next May, but representations are being made for the retention of the crane fora further period. If the crane is taken away the salvage of sunken ships in Kielharbour will be seriously interfered with.18. In general the arrangements for the collection and shipment of booty scrap seem to be working very satisfactorily and reflect considerable credit both onthe Disposals Group under Mr. McFeat and the Scrap Export Agency underCol. Hopkinson. These two organisations are the only ones producing substantial quantities of scrap for export from Germany, and it is of the utmost importance that everything should be done to widen the scope of their operations and provideall possible facilities to enable them to increase their output. There is no doubtthat there is a large potential reserve of booty scrap and that the main obstacles in the way of these organisations reaching their target of 50,000 tons a monthare the shortage of labour in certain districts and the deficiency of road transportvehicles in others. As regards the former, there is probably little to be done to remedy the position unless and until some effective steps are taken to make scrapwork more attractive than it is at present in relation to other forms of employment.The transport difficulty, however, could be overcome if necessary by the exportfrom this country of additional vehicles. Mr. McFeat and Col. Hopkinson havebeen asked to submit an appreciation of the position in this regard and to set out what the actual needs are as compared with the number of vehicles at present available.A. F.

If the additional facilities referred to here-under became available 2,000 could be employed. (At present we have about550 men on loan from B.A.O.R. (Germans) for a very limited period only.)2. SupervisionIt is desirable that the technical supervision should continue to be found bythe S.E.A. (Scrap Export Agency) whose engagements arrangements are muchmore flexible than those of the C.C.G. and who are able in consequence to engageand to dispense with personnel in accordance with their needs.There are at present fifteen field officers, excluding the personnel of the base shipping depot. It is considered that to cover the ground properly anadditional fifteen officials are required, the great majority of these may be of junior status.3. Technical Advice(a) There will be great benefits if an expert on oxyacetylene cutting could make a tour of the Zone to advise generally on the subject, and particularly toadvise on the matter of gas bottles of which many different types are available.(b) An expert is required to make an appraisal of the cranes and heavy equipment now held as local surplus by the B A.O.R. to determine what sparesare required to make whatever could be made available to us serviceable.A fully equipped workshop with an adequate supply of skilled man-power is available as booty, and can be taken over for the re-conditioning of heavyplant. It will probably be necessary to obtain Treasury sanction to United Statesdollar expenditure in purchasing the necessary spare parts.The advice of this expert will also be welcome in the matter of whatpermanent British supervision will be required in the workshops.4. Equipment(a) Cranes. Owing to shortage of labour, it is essential to mechanise to thefull.Apart from fixed cranes of various types on installations being cut up, thereare some forty-eight mobile cranes in service, including a few which are the propertyof German contractors.   Of those about twenty-seven are under repair.It is considered that there is room for a further seventy cranes (for detailssee hereunder) most of which it is presumed will have to be found by rebuildingU/S B.A.O.R. equipments.(Note. The R.A.F. are at present backloading to the United Kingdom- forty-eight 5-ton cranes.   This matter has been reported by S.EA. toI. &amp; S.D. Ltd.)35165 d
(b) Cutting Equipment. A certain number of cutters are being receivedfrom the United Kingdom and additional cutters are being manufactured locally.An additional 400 are needed and if the supply from the United Kingdom canbe increased it would help materially.(o) Bottles. We are collecting gas bottles from all available local sources(booty and any surpluses) but will, it is estimated, fall short of our needs byabout 3,000. Distances are great, from cutting points to filling points, and the turn round is slow.5. Load CarriersWe operate a number of convoy units for the movement of stores, scrap and personnel. There are at present ten convoys. Six of these are mounted with10-ton Diesel trucks, the remainder with 3-ton petrol trucks. All are deterioratingquickly and require much workshop attention. (They were old when we tookthem on.)We could well do with a further 300 10-tonners Diesel to replace the 3-tonners.6. Light transport the scrap sites are widely dispersed, and supervision is difficult. To obtainthe best from the labour available this must be improved, and for this purposethirty light vehicles of the utility type are desirable to transport field officers,and to move gas bottles where necessary.7. Labour InducementsThe possibility of giving inducements in kind to labour was discussed. Togive booty scrap labour the same rate of incentive as commercial scrap labour would cost 6s. Gd. per ton. The matter will be examined in detail for possibledifficulties in implementation, and reported on later.8. Ship breakingThis is not a very important source of scrap in relation to the whole, andmore expensive. It is not being tackled nationally at present, or with sufficienttechnical knowledge and plant.Discussions are proceeding between Disposals Group and S.E.A. as to whatis the correct solution to include salvage, and ship-breaking as one co-ordinatedtask.The right answer will probably be the employment of German contractors,who alone have all the necessary equipment. It will probably also be necessaryto take over from C.C.G. officers from the Marine Salvage Branch of the control commission for general supervision.9. Protective ClothingThe supply already provided for will not last for more than 6-9 months, andwill then have to be replaced.10.

GeneralThe additional equipment asked for is apparently out of proportion to theincrease of yield to be expected. In part this is due to the fact that the additionalscrap will be more difficult to win, and will be in less accessible places; in partbecause some of the present equipment is borrowed and will in due course be withdrawn; and in part because the present equipment is wearing out quickly,and must be replaced.(Signed) P.

APPENDIX V1st December, 1947Memorandum from John M. Duncanson to H. R. M. Farmer, Esq., Clerk to theSub-Committee, House of Commons, S.W.I.STEEL PRODUCTION IN GERMANYLevel of Industry and Scrap supplies the maximum production of steel in Germany under the Level of Industry,is fixed at 10 - 7 million ingot tons per annum. It is recognised that this productioncannot be attained immediately and that there must be a steady growth from thepresent low level. Under the Marshall Plan, the production should grow pro-gressively from 4,075,000 ingot tons an 1948 to 10 million tons in 1951.Bearing in mind the quality of the raw materials available, the methods usedfor steel making in Germany, the types of steel to be made and the demand forfertilisers, the plan provides for roughly half of the steel to be made by the BasicBessemer or Thomas process and half by open hearth plus electric furnaces.The plant to be retained in Germany makes ample provision for this distribution.In accordance with previous German practice, the Thomas steel will be made from a high proportion of pig iron made largely from German ores and the openhearth furnaces will be supplied with a very high proportion 72 per cent, ofthe charge of scrap.The tonnage of steel to be made in each of the next four years, according to the marshall Plan, and the quantities of scrap required in each year, are given in-   Table I.This scrap will be secured from within the industry itself and its associatedenginering and fabricating shops the estimated tonnages of scrap so arising arealso given in Table I.It will be noted that, apart from the year 1948, this plan provides for the steel industry to be self-supporting as regards its supplies of scrap. The year1948 will be abnormal in so far as :  (a) The demand for steel of any quality will lead to the use of inferiorqualities which in normal times would be re-melted as scrap.(b) There is a time lag between the steel being made and the scrap returning from the finishing industries.During this year 1948 it is anticipated that the steel furnaces will consumeabout 430,000 tons of accumulated and processed scrap, but that there will be nodraw on external sources in subsequent years, no matter what the rate ofproduction.Scrap for Pig Iron ManufacturersThe plan also provides for the use of scrap in the blast furnaces in order to economise in coke consumption and to enrich the furnace burden to give increasediron production.Since the quality of basic slag for fertiliser must be maintained as high aspossible, the amount of scrap which can be used in blast furnaces making Thomasiron is strictly limited.   The amount of scrap so used would be about 5 per cent.On the other hand, much larger proportions of scrap can be usefully chargedinto furnaces making other qualities of iron, and charges of 22^ per cent, of scrap would be used in these furnaces for the years 1948 and 1949, and 20 per cent,for 1950 and 18 per cent, for 1951 and thereafter.The production of pig iron, under the Marshall Plan, and the amount of scrap required by the blast furnaces for the next four years, is given in Table II.The specifications for scrap used in blast furnaces for quality other thanHematite, can be much wider than that used for steel-making and practically anytype of scrap within a limited range of alloy content can be used.The scrap required for this purpose would be supplied from the normal scrapmerchant&apos;s collection of obsolete plant, scrap from consumer goods, and ordinarywear and tear.
The total requirements of scrap for iron and steel-making for the four years,from sources external to the steel-making and fabricating industry, are estimated to be as follows : 1948 1949 1950 1951773,000 525,000 666,000 826,000 tonsThe abnormal use of scrap in 1948, due to limited fuel supplies and lowproduction level of operating units, and the gap between steel-making and thereturn of scrap, can be readily met by the use of the large quantities of accumu-lated stock of scrap which was estimated at 1st December, 1947, at about 850,000tons at the steel works and scrap merchants&apos; yards. The quantities required from 1949 onwards are well below the amount of scrap which should be available through the scrap merchants from normal obsolescence and wear and tear. Inthe estimates for scrap supplies in the United Kingdom, this scrap is assessedat about 14 per cent, of the ingot production. Assuming only 10 per cent, inGermany, due to delay of normal replacement and similar causes, the amount of scrap so available would be of the order of 550,000 tons in 1949 rising to 1 million tons in 1951 and thereafter.The programme of iron and steel manufacture will therefore make no demand on the large quantities of scrap, estimated at 4 or 5 million tons lying about inGermany and not yet collected by the scrap merchants.Table I.
