(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP. (ho) 972h.TH MARCH.  191x8CABINETSTATEMENT ON PERSONAL INCOMES,  COSTS and prices;______ffOLLOW-UP ACTIONMemorandum by the Minister&apos;of Labour andNjaMeiBjod,.^At the request of the Trades Union Congress,the Prime Minister, accompanied by the Chancellor of theExchequer and myself,  yesterday met a deputation to discussthe situation that had arisen following the despatch toWages Councils on 9th March of the letter approved by theCabinet at their meeting on 6th March (CM. (48)  20thConclusions, Minute 5).      The Trades Union Congress took the view that this letter might be interpreted as   meaningthat the Government regarded the principles laid down inthe White Paper as being in the nature of a law or a directive -imposed by the Government rather than proposalsfor which the voluntary support of Trade Unions was being sought in the national interest.In the course of the discussions it was suggestedon behalf of the Government that if there was genuinemisunderstanding of its terms the best course would be towithdraw the letter and to substitute another document whichwould express more clearly the Governments intention,- A letter to the Trades Union Congress informing them of the withdrawal of the letter of 9th March wasthereupon drafted and handed to them (Annex l),      (I have-sent a similar letter to the British Employers Confederationto-day),I desire Cabinet approval for the document which isto be substituted and I attach a draft for consideration.(Annex II).      I would propose to consult the Trades UnionCongress and the British Employers Confederation beforeissuing it.COPY NO.    JG . i-i .

ANNEX IIPROPOSED LETTER TO WAGES BOARDS AND WAGES COUNCILSI am directed by the Minister of Labour and national Service to refer to0 the statement on personal incomes, Costs end Prices, which was published as a white paper on 1+th February,  191+8.As was made clear in the subsequent debate inParliament on Thursday,  12th February,   the present economicsituation in the country calls for the utmost co-operationthroughout industry and the Minister trusts,  therefore,  thatwhen considering any matter likely to affect personal incomes,costs and prices, &quot;Wages Boards and Wages Councils will have full regard to  the principles of the White Paper, a copy ofwhich is enclosed for information.As is emphasised in the White Paper itself,   theGovernment regard it as of first importance to maintainunimpaired the full weaponsibi11ty of voluntary joint negotiating machinery for determining the terms andconditions of employment -of workers so covered.     Equally,where Wages Boards and Councils are concerned the government do not wish in any way to derogate from their authority asthe bodies charged with considering and negotiating proposals relating to the terms and conditions of employment of workerscovered by the respective Boards and Councils,.The legal provisions under which Wages Boards andCouncils operate- are net affected by the White Paper whichshould not be regarded as being in the nature of a legalpronouncement -or directive by the Government;    it sets outprinciples for which the Government- seek the support ofindustry.     As an administrative measure however to assist them in the discharge of his statutory responsibility forconfirming proposals,  the Minister will need to be informed
that in their deliberations, Councils and Boards havetaken the White Paper into full account.     For this-purpose I am to request that proposals should now be accompanied by a memorandum for the Minister&apos;sinformation,  showing that this has been done.I  am to request  that you will bring thismatter to the notice of Wages Beards and Councils withoutdelay.
