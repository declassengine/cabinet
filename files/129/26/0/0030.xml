jLIJLJLJLI COPY NO.   ^0CP. (h.8)  120Uth May,  1 9I48.cabinet british NATIONALITY bill memorandum by the Home Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth. RelationsThis Bill, which is awaiting Second Reading in theHouse of Lords,  provides that all persons who are citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies,  or citizens of Canada, Australia,New Zealand, South Africa, Newfoundland, India, Pakistan, SouthernRhodesia, and Ceylon,  shall, by virtue of their respectivecitizenships,  be British subjects.      It also provides thatcitizens of Eire,  although not British subjects,  shall,  in theUnited Kingdom and Colonies, be in a  position under existing legislation equivalent to that of British subjects.Inoha have asked that in place of the&apos; term &quot;Britishsubjects1&apos;, which is in their view open to misunderstanding, thereshould be substituted some term such as &quot;Commonwealth citizens&quot;or &quot;citizens of the Commonwealth&quot;.2. The people of many countries of the Commonwealth areproud to be described as British subjects,  and could not be askedto abandon this title.      To the people,  however,  of certain other Commonwealth countries,  the term &quot;British subject&quot; has anentirely different significance and seems to indicate thecontinued domination of them by the inhabitants of the british isles.      There are obvious objections to compelling the countries where the term &quot;British subject&quot; is unwelcome to accept thislabel as a condition of  remaining within the Commonwealth.      TheBill recognises the desire of the people of Eire to rid themselves of the label &quot;British subject&quot;,  and it seems right to give thepeople of other Commonwealth countries liberty to describethemselves,  if they so wish,  by some term other than &quot;british subject&quot;.      This can be none by inserting in the Bill analternative term and providing that the alternative term shallhuve the same meaning as &quot;British subject&quot;. -p. The suggestion has been  put to the older Dominions that provision be made in the Bill for the use of the term&quot;Commonwe with citizen&quot; or &quot;citizen of the Commonwealth&quot; as analternative to the term &quot;British subject&quot;.      There is naturalreluctance on the part of some Dominion Governments to accept this change, but the replies as yet received do not exclude thepossibility that if an alternative phrase were inserted in theUnited Kingdom Bill,- the other self-governing- countries might be persuaded to follow suit.      It would be very desirable that every Commonwealth country should do the same, but there is nocompelling necessity for uniformity in this particular.      Theprovision in the United Kingdom Bill for the use of an alternativeTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRIT ANISIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)
phrase need not &quot;be dependent on the concurrence of each ofthe self-governing countries.    - Thus it would bo quite feasiblefor some countries to legislate in terms of &quot;British&quot;subject&quot;only and for other countries to legislate in terras of&quot;Commonwealth citizen&quot; or &quot;citizen of the Commonwealth&quot; only,whilst others like the United Kingdom could recognise bothexpressions in their legislation.      The essence of thelegislation in each self-governing country would be to theeffect that its citizens and the citizens of all other countries should in the legislating country be &quot;British subjects&quot; or,as the case may be,  &quot;Commonwealth citizens&quot;:    and thelegislation might in addition provide for the recognition ofboth expressions as alternatives.h* Australia feels particular difficulty in accepting the term &quot;Commonwealth citizen&quot; or &quot;citizen of the Commonwealth&quot;because such terras are liable in Australia to be interpreted as meaning a citizen of the Commonwealth of Australia.      to mitigate this difficulty the only alternative term hithertosuggested has been &quot;citizen of the commonwealth of Nations&quot;.This term is cumbrous,  and like all terms which include theword &quot;Commonwealth&quot; and omit the word &quot;British&quot; is open  to objection on the ground of its indefinite character.      It is,however,  an essential consequence of the development of theCommonwealth that there should be liberty to the people of some commonwealth countries to avoid labelling themselves as&quot;British&quot;,  and the simplest alternative seems to be &quot;Commonwoa 1thcitizen&quot;.      If Australia should feel it impossible to use thisterm in Australian legislation,  they will no doubt be persuaded,at any rate to raise no objection to its use in the UnitedKingdom Bill.5. Arrangements have been made to take the Second heading of the Nationality Bill in the House of Lords on Tuesday next,the 11th May,  and it would be possible on the Second Reading ofthis Bill to announce that on Committee Stage it is proposed, tomove an amendment which will make it possible for people in anyof the self-governing countries,  if they so wish,  to use some-such term as &quot;Gommonweolth citizen&quot; as an alternative to the term &quot;British subject&quot;.      By taking this course the UnitedKingdom Government will snake it clear to India that they areprepared to meet the Indian desire, and will deprive those people in India who want to go out of the Commonwealth of the argument that continuation within the Commonwealth involveslabelling the citizens of India  as British subjects.      Thesuggestion from India that they will find it less difficult tocome into the new scheme if they are relieved of the title&quot;British subject&quot; creates so favourable on opportunity that thereare strong arguments for accepting the suggestion at once. .6. If the Second Reading of  the Bill does not take place before Whitsun,  it will be impossible for the Bill to be passed this Session.      If the Bill is postponed until next Session,there is a possibility that proceedings in the ConstituentAssembly may make India less willing to accept the generalscheme of the Nationality Bill,  and: also a risk that theagreement which has now been secured with the other countries of the Commonwealth will be impaired.      The present Bill hasbeen, generally speaking,  agreed upon after most carefulconsultation with the self-governing countries,  and if it isnow postponed there is a risk that the United Kingdom will lose the initiative and leadership in this matter,  and that variousdiscordant  proposals may be made.
7. It may be that in the future some differentiation between the position of different Commonwealth countries willbecome inevitable,  and that while some remain full membersof the Commonwealth,  others will fall into the position ofassociates rather than members.      Others in the futurereceiving self-governing status may prefer such associatestatus from the first.&apos;      There is nothing in the present bill to prevent such a development,  should it become necessary.      In foot,  the provision in the Bill for clocatinga number of separate citizenships facilitates anydifferentiation that may be necessary in the future betweenthe position of various Commonwealth countries.8. There will no doubt be difficulties in parliament in securing assent to the idea that the  peoples of certain countries may remain within the Commonwealth although notstyling themselves by any term which indicates their british connection.      But is it not right that this difficulty shouldbe faced at once?      Ought not the United Kingdom Governmentand. Parliament, while affirming that those people who wish tocall themselves British subjects shall continue to do so, toaffirm equally that there is to be  liberty to the people ofother Commonwealth countries to remain within the Commonwealththough calling themselves by some title which omits boththe word &quot;British&quot;  and the word &quot;subject&quot;?      Unless  thispoint is made clear at an early date, is not the danger that india and Pakistan may go out of the Commonwealth likely tohe increased?      On the other hand,  is it not possible that a clear statement now that &quot;British subject&quot;  is not the onlygeneral description available for citizens of the widelydiffering nations in what has hitherto been the BritishCommonwealth and Empire may ease the way for those in Indiaand. Pakistan oho desire to remain with us?9. It is accordingly suggested that the Second reading of the Bill in the House of Lords should take place on tuesday next, the 11th May,   as has provisionally beenarranged,  and that in moving the Second Reading it should be explained that the Government has under consideration inconsultation with the Dominions proposals by which clause 1might be brought more into accord with the development whichhas been taking place in Commonwealth relations by the recognition therein of some such designation as &quot;Commonwealthcitizen&quot; as an alternative to &quot;British subject&quot; so that theformer designation may be used by those citizens or countries who consider it more in keeping with the free associationof the peoples of the Commonwealth.P.J.N-B.hth May,   1948.
