9Sy(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET,C.?.(o.o)  1Q921ST APRIL j 19U8CABINETEUROPEAN ECONOMIC CO-operation memorandum by the Secretary of State forForeign affairs my colleagues may wish to have a short accountof developments at Paris in the last month on the subjectof European Economic Co-operation.The Convention on European Economic Co-operation2. On 16th March, 19h8,  a meeting of the Committeeof European Economic Co-operation at the Ministerial levelgave instructions that a Working Party be set up to draw upa multilateral agreement containing certain pledges on thepart of the participating countries and a constitution fora continuing organisation.   Exactly a month later,  on 16thApril, a further Ministerial meeting was held at Paris atwhich a Convention was signed on behalf of the sixteenCommittee of European Economic Co-operation countries and theUnited Kingdom -United States and French zones of Germany,combining the multilateral agreement and constitution in onedocument.3. The work done by the Working Party was very satisfactory both from the general point of view and from ourown.    The Convention and the accompanying protocols andresolutions which will be circulated in the next few daysas a White Paper were approved by unanimous agreement.    the achievement of unanimity on the wide range of subjectscovered within such a short time is a proof of the spirit of urgency, responsibility and of mutual accommodation in whichthe discussions were conducted.   Moreover,  the United kingdom delegation were successful in achieving the kind of organisation which we were anxious to see set up.    this organisation for European Economic Co-operation comprises a council of all the members with an Executive Committee of seven,  these bodies exorcising a large degree of practicalcontrol over the actions of the Secretary-General.    TheConstitution is flexible in detail and will permit theOrganisation&apos;to develop in whatever way the work which has tobe &quot;&quot;done seems to demand.   With this in mind,  the working party established no fixed rules about the frequency of meetings of either the Council or the Executive Committee nor did it&quot;lay down what other Committees should be set up, but   -left decisions on those points to the new Organisationitself.COPY NO.   3o
Chairmanships,  the Secretary-Generalship, and Siteh. I would like to add an explanation of thedecisions on the site, the Secretary-Generalship and theChairmanship.    It became clear at a fairly early stage inthe Working Party that there was a strong body of opinion in favour of Paris as the seat of the Organisation.    Thiswas also the wish of the French Government.    It had been thepolicy of His Majesty&apos;s Government to secure the Chairmanshipboth of the Council (at the Ministerial and official levels)and also of the Executive Committee.    The Benelux Governmentsfelt strongly that they had the right to the third &quot;perquisite&quot;,but at first showed much more interest in the Chairmanshipthan in the Secretary-Generalship, a point on which we werenot disposed to give way to them.   While this point was stillundecided, M. Marjolin,  the French Representative on theWorking Party was building up for himself a reputation forcapability and fairness which seemed to make him admirablyqualified to be appointed Secretary-General.    Thus, when, ata later stage,  the Benelux countries eventually produced a candidate for the Secretary-Generalship,  the majority of the participating countries had already decided that they would prefer M. Marjolin.   The Benelux Governments therefore took the line that they could not agree to the French having boththe site and the Secretsry-Generalship, while Benelux gotnothing.5. This &quot;Was the deadlock which confronted me when Iarrived in Paris.    It seemed to me to be both necessary\y and desirable to accept m. Marjolin as Secretary-General butthat the Benelux Governments hod something of a case.    Inorder therefore  that the Organisation might not start off inthe unhappy atmosphere of a political deadlock, I offeredon behalf of the United Kingdom to renounce either theChairmanship of the Council or,  if preferred,  the chairmanship of. the Executive Committee in favour of Benelux.    The firstoffer was accepted and Belgium was elected Chairman of theCouncil.    This renunciation on our part of an office which wecould have retained if we hod insisted made a great impressioncn the other Delegates, and undoubtedly increased their readiness tc follow our lead on other matters.    In any case,by our occupation, of the Chair of the Executive Committeethrough Sir Edmund Hall-Patch we shall be able to exercise aguiding influence on the &quot;day to day work of the Organisation,and I am therefore certain that the step which we took in solving this difficulty will turn out to have been to ourbenefit as well as to our credit.    Two immediate results were that,  on the following day, I was able to secure all our objectives in regard to the organisation of the consultative council under the Brussels Treaty, and that we have now been invited to provide a Deputy Secretary-General for theOrganisation of European Economic Co-operation itself.    If,as I hope, we are able to do this, we shall secure a furtherkey position from which to guide the work of the Organisation.6. I think it would be appropriate for me to concludeby menti&apos; ning to ray colleagues toe groat debt ov/ed by all thecountries concerned to Sir Oliver Franks and his team ofassistants and advisers for the part they have played in bringing this enterprise so successfully to the end of. its first stage.E .B .Foreign Office, S.W.1. 1 ..21st April, 1948.
