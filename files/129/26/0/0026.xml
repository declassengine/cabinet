Man-power the number of coal-miners on the colliery books rose in the five weeks ofMarch by only 700, compared with a rise of 2,000 in February and 2,500 inJanuary. Net intake in the first two weeks of April was 380. Net intake inthe first quarter of 1948 was 5,200 compared, with 14,404 in the correspondingperiod of 1947. This reduction was due to a higher rate of wastage and a lower rate of recruitment. An average net intake of 8,933 a quarter during the rest ofthe year will be required to raise employment from the level of 723,200 at the endof March to the target of 750,000 at the end of 1948.Intake and outflow of man-power in coal-miningIntake        Outflow       Net Intake1947 1st Quarter   ......      26,882 12,478 -F 14,4041948 1st Quarter   ...       ...      23,180 17,980 -h 5,2002. Recruitment in the cotton spinning industry is showing some improvement.The increase in the number on the books was 550 during the week ended 10th april and 390 in the week ended 17th April. This compares with an average increaseof 220 a week in the first quarter of the year.II. Production3. The index of industrial production (1946 = 100) for February isprovisionally estimated at 124 (the index is adjusted for differences in the numberof week-days in each month). This compares with 118 in January and 123 inNovember 1947. The revised figure of 118 for January indicates that the totallevel of production was about 10 per cent . above the level in january 1947(Table 1).

Output of opencast coal rose to a new record of 375,000 tons in the weekended 1st May well above the target of 240,000 tons for that week. Productionof deep:mined coal, however, declined to 3,849,000 tons. In each week of Apriloutput of deep-mined, coal has been below the targets for these weeks.Total Production of Deep-mined and Opencast Coal1948 January (weekly average)February (weekly average) ...March (weekly average) *Week ended April 10............17............24............May    1............(!) 211 million tons in 1948.* Average of 5 weeks.5. Total production of deep-mined and opencast coal for the first 17 weeks of the year amounted to 69-4 million tons or 1 - 7 per cent, above the target of68-2 million tons for this period.6. Deliveries of coal for overseas shipments and bunkers are now running at about 300,000 tons a week (Table 2).Steel7. Output of steel and pig-iron in the second and third weeks of April was maintained at the high rate achieved in March. In the week ended 17th April,production of steel ingots and castings was 297,000 tons. The output of pig-ironrose further to 182,000 tons. The maintenance of this high rate of productionof pig-iron is dependent on an adequate supply of hard coke. Despatches of hard coke to blast furnaces fell from a weekly rate of 196,700 tons in february to 192,400 tons in March, but recovered to 195,200 tons a week in the first fort-night of April.8.   Stocks of scrap continue to fall slowly (Table 3).Cotton9. Output of cotton yarn (including cotton waste yarns) exceeded18 million lbs. in the week ended 17th April the highest rate since 1941 (Table 3).Motor Vehicles10. Production of passenger cars (including chassis) rose from 5,843 a week in February to 6,469 a week in March. Production for export at 4,786 cars aweek achieved a new record. The substantial expansion in our exports of motor vehicles during the last year has been obtained almost entirely at the expenseof production for the home market (Table 4).11. Exports of passenger cars in March (as recorded in the Trade Accounts)were valued at  5-0 million and exports of commercial vehicles at  2-8 million.British countries take about 60 per cent, by value of our exports of both passengercars and commercial vehicles.12. Exports of passenger cars to the United States increased sharply from 76,000 a month in the last quarter of 1947 to  286,000 a month in the first quarter of 1948 (Table 5).Coalmining Machinery13. More conveyors for home use are being produced. Deliveries rose to312 in March. Production of colliery tubs and mining cars also increased(Table 4).
III.-Building14. The number.of new permanent houses completed in Great Britain rose from 15,725 in February to 20,005 in March. Construction was begun on 11,449houses and the number under construction declined again from 240,146 at the;end of February to 231,590 at the end of March. New contracts for permanent houses rose in March from 5,956 to 6,547 (Table 6).IY.-External Trade15. The adverse visible trade balance (retained imports (c.i.f.) less exports(f.o.b.)) rose in March to  51-1 million after falling steadily from  58 million in September 1947 to  31 million in February.16. The value of United Kingdom imports rose sharply in March to 178-2  23-4 million more than the average of January and February and only 1 million below the peak recorded in July 1947. Food, drink and tobaccoaccounted for  17-5 million of this increase (Table 7).17. The value of British exports rose to  121 million in March thehighest level attained since July 1920. The volume of these exports is provi-provisionally estimated at 29 per cent, above the average of 1938. The revised target for the volume of exports at the end of 1948 is 50 per cent, above 1938.18. Table 8 shows how the current level of exports compares with the newtargets in value terms for the end of 1948. Exports of textiles and clothing inMarch showed no improvement on the average of January and February anda very considerable expansion will be necessary to achieve the targets set. Metalsand metal products (including vehicles, ships and aircraft) accounted for mostof the increase in exports in March.Y. Balance of Payments19. The net drain on reserves in April amounted to no more than  20 millioncompared with  47 million in March, a monthly average of  49 million in thefirst quarter of this year, and of  58 million in the last quarter of 1947. the deficit with Canada departed little from expectations, but the loss of UnitedStates dollars has been very much lower. It is too early to say what are thereasons for this sharp decline, though it may have something to do with increasingconfidence in sterling following the passage of the European Recovery Act inthe United States. This could manifest itself in a greater willingness to holdsterling and would result in a temporary increase in our dollar receipts. It ishoped that a clearer picture will emerge during the next few weeks.20. Very provisional estimates of the total United Kingdom Balance ofPayments in the first quarter of 1948 have been made. These show a net deficit on current account of  90 million, compared with the forecast for the first half year of  136 million given in the Economic Survey. Though the rate ofdeficit is thus higher than was expected there were a number of special factors in the first quarter not known earlier which fully account for the difference,e.g., a payment of  10 million to Argentina under our recent agreement, and heavytransfers to West Africa of profits on the sale of commodities which were not expected until the second quarter.21. There were a number of interesting developments reflected in the capital account during the first quarter. As reported in the previous issue of thisReport the net drain on reserves amounted to  147 million against a six-month&apos;sforecast of  222 million. Sterling balances which fell heavily in 1947 rose by 28 million over the quarter, a movement which conceals an increase of no lessthan  112 million in sterling area holdings and a decrease of  84 million in non--sterling area holdings. At the same time there is a good deal of evidencethat capital movements to the Rest of the Sterling Area, particularly SouthAfrica, were again on a large scale.  This matter is now under closer examination.22. It seems clear from the first quarter&apos;s results that the balance of pay-ments position of the Rest of Sterling Area has improved substantially; the netdrain on our reserves has been reduced and is even lower than was expected, andin some directions a surplus on current account with certain non-sterling area countries is developing. This improvement together with the continued outflow of capital from the United Kingdom is chiefly responsible for the new and risingtrend of sterling balances held by sterling area countries.

Bilateral Negotiations23. Since my last report agreement has been reached with Ceylon on sterling balances and dollar requirements. This provides for releases from the blockedsterling balances of  4 million, plus  1 million in reserve, in respect of workingbalances; and  3^ million in respect of current requirements in the remainder of1948. It is hoped that Ceylon will be a net earner of dollars in the year 1948 tothe extent of some  6 million.24. We have also reached agreement with Hungary covering the calendar year 1949, under which we shall take from Hungary some  3 million of usefulgoods and some  6 million of foodstuffs, including 2,500 tons of bacon, in the hungarian economic year August 1948-July 1949. The Hungarians have con-firmed that a Financial Delegation will come to the United Kingdom before theend of 1948 to discuss regularisation of pre-war debts including the amount tobe transferred in 1949.25. Negotiations are continuing with Brazil and S.C.A.P. (Japan), andshould be resumed shortly with Mexico and Yugoslavia.26. Negotiations with Sweden are about to begin (extension and review ofTrade and Payments Agreement) and new talks with Spain and Norway havecommenced, on Trade and Financial questions.VII. Prices and FinanceRetail Prices27. The Ministry of Labour index of retail prices (17th June, 1947, = 100)was unchanged in March at 106. The index of food prices increased from108 in February to 109 in March and the index of clothing prices from 104 to 105.Wholesale prices28. The Board of Trade index of wholesale prices rose by only 0 - 3 per cent, inMarch to 214 (1938 = 100) the smallest monthly increase since August 1947. Theindex for industrial materials and manufactures as a whole rose by 0 - 5 per cent,in March to 230 - 5. Reductions in prices of wool, silk and rubber were outweighed by higher cotton prices. The index for the cotton group was 9 - 6 per cent, greater in March than in February and 39 per cent, above the level at the beginning ofthe year.29. The average price of building materials showed no significant changecompared with February.Import and export prices30. The index of import prices rose again by 1 per cent, in March to 277(1938 = 100). The export prices index increased by less than one half per cent, to248.Prices in the United States31. Commodity prices in the United States have fallen slightly duringthe last fortnight. Moody&apos;s index of staple commodity prices (31st December,1931, = 100) was 420 on 12th April and 414 on 3rd May.  million46713315693675948
