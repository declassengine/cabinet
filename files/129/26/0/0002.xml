The Minister of Agriculture addressed a Press Conferenceon 4th February appealing to allotment holders and gardeners to double the area usually planted to potatoes.   He stressed thatthis should be done at the expense of summer vegetables, not wintergreens or roots, which arc just as important in their way.   Valuableeditorial publicity resulted.
