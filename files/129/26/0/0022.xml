j( SECRETCP. (U6)  112I 26TH APRIL,   19h8CABINETCONSTITUTIONAL REFORM IN Cyprus memorandum by the Minister of State for Colonial affairs circulate as the Annex to this paper an outline of-&apos;a proposed Constitution for Cyprus, which it is intendedshould doe laid before the Consultative Assembly in Cyprus asthe expression of His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy for constitutional reform.    This outline was considered by theCommonwealth Affairs Committee on 23rd April (C. A. (h-3)6th Meeting).    The Committee recommended certain amendments(which have been incorporated, with the exception noted inparagraph 5 below),  and invited me to bring- the proposals before the Cabinet.2.        In framing constitutional proposals for Cyprus,  it isnecessary to remember that to offer less than a certain minimum degree of self-government is to court entirerejection.    Cyprus had a Legislature with an elected majoritybetween 1882 and 1931.    The Cypriote do not regard themselves as politically inexperienced,  and. they are fully aware thatrelatively liberal Constitutions have been graaited toColonial territories (e.g.  in the West Indies) with whichthey cannot but compare favourably their own historicalbackground and standard of social and political development.If the move made by His Majesty&apos;s Government in October,  1946,to grant Cyprus a more liberal form of Government were now to end in total rejection of our proposals by the consultative assembly,   the dissident element in the Island would be greatly strengthened, with adverse consequences within and possiblyoutside Cyprus.    On the other hand there is no strong public demand in Cyprus for full self-government.    The Governor considersthat the Constitution proposed in the Annex to this paper wouldbe acceptable to the bulk of public opinion in the Island. &apos;3.        Our strategic requirements in Cyprus and the middle east generally have been very much in mind in framing theseconstitutional proposals.    I am satisfied,  and I think theCommonwealth Affairs Committee agreed,   that there is nothing in the Constitution now proposed which would prejudice our strategic requirements.    While the minimum essentialsafeguards for these purposes must be and have been inserted,we must avoid being placed in the position where it couldplausibly be said that we were denying political libertiesto a developed people like- the Cypriots simply for&quot;Imperialist&quot; reasons.    Moreover,  to delay the introductionof any constitutional reform might give rise to serious political difficulties.    Internal stability is likely to be best served by giving the Cypriots effective centredInstitutions which,  though short of fully responsible government,  they can take a genuine share in working,  and inwhich their political energies can be absorbed.COPY NO.! &apos;      f.    109IIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
*   III)ih.        The essential features of .thc Constitution now proposed are three.    First,  an. elected Legislature with power to debate and legislate about the affairs of the Island within the limitsset by our Imperial interests.    Secondly, an Executiveresponsible to the Governor and not to the Legislature.Thirdly,  the provision of a two-way link between these twoorgans&quot; by means of (i) the appointment of a small number of key officials to,seats in the Legislature,  and (ii) theappointment of the loaders of the elected majority in theLegislature to membership of the Executive Council.    Thelatter feature is in effect an embryonic &quot;Ministerial&quot; system,These unofflcal Councillors would be associated with the work,of certain Departments of Government and, with the aid of theinformation thereby obtained, would be able to share activelyin the corporate responsibility of the Executive Council in formulating Government policy.    The system is, however,  short of fully responsible government in that the unofficialCouncillors would not have final executive control over theDepartments associated with them,  and the Governor would notbe bound to take the advice of his Executive Council.    TheseCouncillors would speak on the subjects allocated to them inthe Legislature and would in general bo expected to supportGovernment policy there.    The system is a flexible one,  andit is intended &quot;that it should not be written into theConstitution itself-but left to administrative arrangements.I believe that it affords a promising line of approach in theconditions of Cyprus and I am informed that it is likely tobe accepted by the Cypriot people.    I may add that a similarembryonic  &quot;Ministerial&quot; system has been in existence for over three years in Jamaica, whose Governor reports  that,considering the inexperience of &quot;ministers&apos;,  the system shows signs of developing in the right direction.5.        There is one amendment recommended by the commonwealth affairs Committee at their mooting on 23rd April which I havenot incorporated in the Annex to this paper.    The committee considered that- the Legislature should not have power todiscuss amendments to the Constitution and that a prohibitionto this effect should be added to the prohibition of discuss  on of the status of the Colony in Section III ,(a) of the Annex.I am advised;, however,   that this would not bo legally permissible.It is provided in Section 5 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act,1865,  that every representative Legislature shall have full powerto make laws respecting the Constitution, powers and procedure of such Legislature,  provided that such laws ore passed in such manner and form as may be required by any Act of Parliament,Letters Patent, Order in Council or Colonial Law for the timebeing in force In the Colony.    &quot;Representative Legislature&quot; is defined as a Colonial Legislature- which comprises a legislativebody of which one. half are elected by the inhabitants.   &quot;TheLegislature proposed for Cyprus will come within this definition,and it follows &quot;that  they will have a statutory right to passlaws respecting their own Constitution.    A prohibition againstdiscussion of any amendments to the Constitution would thereforeappear to be ultra vires.    The Order in Council establishing the Constitution can, however, lay down a &quot;manner and form&quot; forthe passing of laws for this purpose.    I propose therefore thatBills amending the Constitution should bo one of the classes of bills for which the Governor&apos;s prior consent to introductionshould be required,  and Section III (b) of the Annex has been amended accordingly.    In addition such a Bill will require to be reserved in accordance with Gootion III (d).
6.       Finally,  the Commonwealth Affairs Committee in their discussions hove also taken the view, which I share,  that aswell as reforming the Constituion we should press on withthe development of local government in Cyprus.    For reasons which have &quot;been explained to the Committee, I propose to ask the Governor to deal with this as a separate issue and not toinclude it in the constitutional proposals presented to the consultative Assembly,  since the Assembly is not competent to consider local government affairs and was not summoned forthat purpose.7,        I therefore invite the Cabinet to agree that theproposals outlined in the Annex to this paper should be laidbefore the Consultative Assembly as on expression of HisMajesty&apos;s Government&apos;s policy for constitutional reform in cyprus.    In the subsequent negotiations with the Assembly -itwill,  I take it, be the wish of the Cabinet that the Secretaryof State and the Governor should have a reasonable latitudewithin the broad limits here set out.(Intld.)    L.Colonial Office,S.W.1.26TH APRIL,   19h8.
annex proposed ^Outline Constitution for cyprus to&apos; be&quot; placed before the Consultative Assembly.I *     Composition of the Legislature(a) There shall be a Legislature consisting of 22elected members,  i.e. approximately 1 per 20,000 of thepopulation, and h official members (the Colonial Secretary,Attorney-General, Treasurer,  and Senior Commissioner).(b) Of the elected members, 18 shall be elected on ageneral electoral register and h. on a Turkish communal35electoral  register.     The Consultative Assembly will beinvited to express their views on the number of elected members proposed, and. some latitude could be allowed.(c) If there were strong pressure to- that effect in the consultative Assembly (but not otherwise),  it could be conceded that the four official members should not vote, butthey would of course otherwise enjoy all the rights- and duties of full members of the Legislature.&apos;25II. Chairman of the LegislatureThe Chairman shall in the first instance beappointed by the-Governor from among persons who are not members of the Legislature.III. Powers of the Legislature and Reserved Powers(a) The Constitution will provide that the Legislaturemay not discuss the status of the Colony within theC ommonwe alth.(b) No money Bill or resolution, no Bill which in theopinion of the Governor affects defence,  external affairs orthe special interests of minorities, and no Bill amending the Constitution, may be introduced or moved without the prior consent of the Governor through the Chairman.(c) Power will be reserved to the Governor to declare aBill to have effect as if it had been passed in any instance in   which,  in his opinion,  its enactment is expedient in theinterest of public order, good faith,  or good government,and it has been rejected by the Legislature or passed in,an unacceptable form.   The Governor will also be empowered toreturn Bills to the Legislature with amendments reoommpnaedby him.-This method of safeguarding Turkish interests is taken from the 1882-1931 Constitution.    I am assured that the Turkishcommunity would regard any other arrangement with deep suspicionas opening the way to non-Turkish influence over Turkishrepresentation;    and in the circumstances I recommend itsretention, at least for the present.   Arrangements for safe-guarding European and Indian representation&quot; in Kenya and Fijioffer an analogy and a precedent.    The remaining (non-Turkish)minorities are extremely small and can best be included, in thegeneral electoral register, as they were under the 1882-1931Constitution./$The small number of official members proposed, wouldin any case not be there for their voting strength but in orderto maintain an essential link between Executive&quot;and Legislature\while the provisions under Section III below would safeguard against unsatisfactory legislation.-h-
(cl)    The Governor will he empowered to reserve Bills forthe signification of His Majesty&apos;s pleasure,  and will he required to -reserve certain classes of Bills including inparticular any Bill which in the opinion of the Governoraffects defence or external affairs or discriminates againstminorities,  or any Bill amending the Constitution.(e) Subject to (d) above, Bills passed by the Legis-lature will,  of course, need the assent of the Governor in theKing&apos;s name.    He may refuse assent and the usual provision will be made for the disallowance of laws by His Majesty.(f) There will also be the usual reservation to HisMajesty of power to revoke, odd to or amend the constitution and to make laws by Order in Council.(g) Provision will be made for a small &quot;reserved civil list&quot;  (i&apos;G* a list not susceptible of amendment by theLegislature except by amendment of the Constitution) covering the salaries of the Governor and the Judiciary.IV. S tanding-jjrder sStanding Orders for the Legislature will in the firstinstance be prepared en the instructions of the Governor andany subsequent amendment will require the Governor&apos;s approval.V. Duration of LegislatureElections to the Legislature shall take place at intervals of not less than four,  or alternatively five, years.The Consultative Assembly will be free to choose which periodthey prefer.VI. FranchiseEvery male British subject of 21 years or over who isresident in the Colony shall have one vote.   Provision pwillbe made to enfranchise Cypriots and others who ore not35British subjects, but who have a residence qualification.It will be for the Consultative Assembly to consider -whetherthe franchise should be extended to women;    if such extension,is desired, His Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared toaccept it.&apos; VII. Executive Council(a). The Governor will remain the head of the executive and will not be bound by the advice of his Executive Councilbut will be requireel. to inform the Secretary of State in anycase in which he acts contrary to its advice.&quot;Cypriots born before 191h who failed to exercise their right of option to acquire British nationality on the annexation of the Island are not British subjects.    Thereare also a number of Cypriots returned to the Island from egypt whose nationality is dubious.    The proposed provisionfor enfranchising non-British Cypriots repeats that of the1925 Order in Council.
(b) The Council will consist of &quot;the four official members of the Legislature and of such other persons, being elected members of the Legislature or officials (but notunofficials who are not elected members of the Legislature),as His Majesty may from time to time direct through a secretary of state.(c) It would bo the intention in the first instance toappoint three Greek members from the majority party in theLegislature and one Turkish members    These unofficial members of Executive Council would be associated with certain specified departments (a tentative distribution would, beagriculture and lands, labour, health and education,  and turkish affairs), and would be termed &quot;Councillors&quot; for those subjects.   .The procedure governing the relation ofthese unofficial Councillors with the departments assigned to them would bo prescribed by the Governor, with whomultimate executive control of the departments would rest.(d) In order te assure flexibility,  the provisions ofparagraph (c) above would not be written into theConstitution but would be made clear by other means,  forexample by an open despatch from the Secretary of Stateaccompanying the introduction of the Constitution.
