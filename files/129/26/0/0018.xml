(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)3 E 0 RE T COPY NO.   \ 020th April. 19U8.CABINETTHE RIVE POWER treaty memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will require an account of myconversations with the other Foreign Ministers in Paris and ofthe progress made to implement the Five Power Treaty.2. The main purpose of the Paris meeting was to secure agreement on the organisation of the Consultative Council and inparticular on the choice of a capital as its permanent seat.On practical grounds I favoured London, but I had been unablehitherto to secure general agreement on this point.      The FrenchGovernment had put forward the somewhat unpractical proposal thatthe Foreign Ministers should meet at the various capitals in turn ond that sub-committees should be similarly dispersed.      the benelux Governments were prepared in principle to accept Londonand wished the whole organisation to be centred there, but theywere disposed to defer a decision until agreement had beenreached on the distribution of posts in the Committee of european economic Co-operation.      On arrival in Paris I found M. Bidaultprincipally concerned lest a complicated and expensive machinery should be prematurely established;    whilst the Benelux Governments,who seemed anxious to take the opportunities afforded by the FivePower Treaty to play a more ambitious role in world affairs, were clearly thinking of on organisation on more grandiose lines thanpresent circumstances would appear to justify.3. I emphasised that the essential thing was to devise themost practical and effective machinery,  and on this basis I hodlittle difficulty in securing general agreement.      As mycolleagues will have seen from the published communique (a copyof which is attached) it was decided that, whereas the fiveForeign Ministers should meet at least once every three months ineach of the capitals of the signatory States in turn, thePermanent Organ of the Council and the Secretariat,  os well asthe bodies responsible for military matters,  should beestablished in London.      This arrangement, which represents a compromise with the French view,  ensures,  however,  that the main political and military work will be done in London.      Theobligation to hold a meeting of Foreign Ministers every threemonths in a different capital may involve seme inconvenience, butI assented to it in the belief that it will be a valuable meansof ensuring harmony and of giving the necessary impetus to thedevelopment of Western Union.      Similarly the provision which hasbeen made for meetings between the Ministers concerned in the.various fields specified in the Treaty (economic, financial,social,  cultural) will help to keep the policies of theGovernments in line and so serve the common purpose.-1-
U.. The ether Foreign Ministers,  particularly M. Bidau.lt,were naturally much concerned with recent  events in Europe.In consequence emphasis was laid on the urgent need for en earlyexamination of the military situation.      It was felt that whilstAmerican support was essential and every effort should &quot;be made tosecure it,  the five Powers should simultaneously initiatemilitary conversations designed to build up gradually a combinedmilitary force and a single defensive organisation for all theTreaty Powers.      Evidence that Europe was helping itself was themost promising means cf bringing about American participation inthe defence of the West.      It was also agreed that M.  Bidault and myself should address a joint message to Mr.   Marshall recallingour exchange of messages in March,  informing him of the resultsof this further meeting in Paris and emphasising the importanceof arranging without delay the conversations envisaged byMr. Marshall between the United States,   the United Kingdom, Franceand Benelux.      A message in this sense was subsequently drafted in concert with the French and despatched the same day.5. I then pointed out that,  although I accepted theimportance of pushing on with the military conversations-,  Iattached equal importance to the other aspects of co-operation for which provision had been made in the Treaty.      In particular,if the idea of Western Union was to grow amongst our peoples, itwas necessary to show the ordinary man that Western Union hadsomething for him.      Incidentally M. Bidault suggested that thefive Powers should organise a joint Social Services Exhibitionand I think: that this idea should be further explored.      In generalmy views found ready acceptance.      It was recognised that at thisstage it aiight not be desirable to hove permanent committeesdealing with economic,  financial,  social and cultural affairs,but that the most practical course would be to organise meetings,at ell events in the first instance on an ad hoc basis,  as hasbeen done in the case of the financial talks which open atThe Hague next week.6. The first meeting of the Permanent Organisation inLondon (the four Ambassadors and a representative appointed byHis Majesty&apos;s Government) will take place on 2.6th April.      their first tasks will be to appoint 0 secretary and to put the military conversations in train.      It will also be necessary to broachsocial and cultural problems at an early date, but pending theconclusion of the financial talks it does net seem likely that economic problems will arise.7. In general I received the impression that the five powers ore concerned to make the Treaty an instrument of genuineco-operation and that provided they receive some assurance thatthe problem of security will be tackled,  they will pursue withresolution the course on which they have embarked.      I believethat the agreement which was reached in Paris provides practical and efficient machinery for the realisation of our aims.E.B.Foreign Office,  S.W.1..20th April,  191+8.
