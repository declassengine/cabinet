(it)  21st Conclusions,Minute l) I have discussed the Monopolistic Practices Billwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer,  the Minister of Defence,the Lore Chancellor,  the Minister of Health and the Presidentof the Board of Trade.2.     PygopipUPR ?f cpndifcjioftS? t9 ffih&amp;oh ,,the 3111 Rppljles.     TheCabinet criticised the phrase &quot;conditions of imperfect condition&quot;which appeared in the long title and in Clauses 3, k and 5 ofthe draft Bill annexed  to CP. (I48)  73.      We  therefore sought analternative v/ordinpe bearing in mind that the long title mustcontain a phrase, whxch the House authorities accept as covering the contents of the Bill,  adequate to cover the provisions   of clauses 3 to 3 and that these Clauses should enable thePresident of the Beard of Trade  to act in conditions arisingfrom a wide variety of restrictive practices.      Our conclusion was that &quot;seme such phrase as &quot;conditions of monopoly er other conditions restrictive of trade&quot; should be used in the longtitle and the t no general description of tin:, conditions shouldbe attempted in Glauses 3, I4 and 5,  which should merely refer to &quot;conditions to which this Act applies&quot;.     We recognise thatthis change may make it easier for the Opposition to put downamendments designed to brine restrictive, practices by tradeunions within the scope of tin. Bill,  but it is clear that,whatever- the form of the Bill, we could not hope to ovoid a challenge en this point.3.      Criterion for determining when a reference .to the QoiBlllgMiaimav be made.      Clauses 3 to  l3 of the draft Bill annexed  to0.1&apos;. (Ad) 73 provided  that conditions to which the Bill appliedshould not- be deemed to prevail, unless more than one half of thegoods in question were affected,  and in paragraph 3 (i) ofCi-.(liS) 60 the President of the Board of Trade. suggested thatthe criterion should be either &quot;more  than one-third&quot; or &quot;asubstantial part&quot;.At our meeting, we were on the whole in favour of theuse of the ohra.se &quot;substantial part&quot; although we appreciated that it would be  criticised in Parliament for lack cf definitionend that there might be a &quot;small risk that in a particular casethe courts might hold  that the Board of Trade had acted ultravires in regarding as a substantial part an amount which no reasonable person&quot;would so regard.      We felt that it was notpossible,  if a definite fraction were fixed,   to cover, with
absolute certainty all  the cases which in course of time we might v/ish to refer to the Commission and we concluded,therefore,  that on the whole some such expression as &quot;asubstantial part&quot; should bo used.Since then, however, the President   of the Board ofTrade,  in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and myself,  has given further consideration to this matter in thelight of the draft proposed for giving effect tc our intention.It has been, necessary in drafting to define what    is meant byrelating the proportion to an &quot;appreciable degree of general control&quot;.     He feels tart the defence of such&quot;a criterion inthe House of Commons would not be easy (apart from the addeddiffieul-ties which the Departments end the Commission wouldhave in working the Act)  and he takes the view that the more precise yard-stick of one-third should be adopted.     A rapidsurvey has shown that in the known cases of substance forwhich figures are available the figure of one-half would indeed be adequate, but a further margin is necessary as an administrative convenience and to maoo reasonably sure thatcases which have not yet shown themselves are not missed rsthe result of the adoption of too high, a percentage.h*      Public,, interest.      Clause 9 of the draft Bill annexed to cp. (I48) 73 conferred en the Board of Trade power to give theCommission general or particular direct!ens as to public policy,but in paragraph 2 (c)  of CP. (ho) 80 the President of theBoard of Trade proposed that this provision should be omittedas being inconsistent with the Commission&apos;s semi-judicialcharacter.We are agreed that the Bill should not confer powerto give directions to the Commission,  but we do not think thatit can be left entirely to the Commission to determine What is against the public interest.     We therefore propose that,where the Commission,  having been asked to report whetherparticular conditions or practices are against the public interest,either report that they ore not or fail  to melee any definitereport,  the Board of Trade should nevertheless have power tomake an order under Clause 11, if the House of Commons have passed a resolution declaring such conditions or practices tobe  against the public interest.      The Bill contemplates thatthe Commission should sometimes be asked to report on the&apos;factsclone end in such cases we recommend that the Beard of trade should have no power to make an order without a further reference-to the Commission on the question of public interest.5.       ojooijoej^oi: The Minister ofDefence is apprehensive  that the provisions of the Bill might beused to prejudice the interests of co-operative societies and suggested thet such societies should be exemoted from theoperation of the Bill.We see no convincing reasons for exempting co-operative societies and,  though thev may on occasions he called on tojustify their activities,  we believe that the likelihood oftheir being prejudiced by the Bill is remote.6.     Follow-up action.      We unhorse  the suggestion m.ade by thePresident of the Board of Trade in paragraph 3 (ii) of cp. (ho)  GO that, where the Commission had made a suggestionfalling short of recommend;.tions for the use of statutorysanctions,   the Board of Trade may ash the Commission to see howfar  their suggestions or any made by the- Board of Trade arebeing put into effect.
7.      Mi see llraieous. ppint-q.      We did not consider the points raised in paragraphs 2 (d) and 3 (iv) of CP. (I48) 80 withregard to the position of other Departments and the omission of transport from the scope of the&quot;Bill,  since we thought thatthe Of bine t would  themselves wish to hear the views of theDepartmental Ministers concerned,8.     Draft Bill,..     A revised draft of the Bill giving effectto  the- recommendations which we have made in paragraphs 2 andi-l  is attached.     This draft incorporates our original conclusion to refer to some such expression as &quot;c substantial part&quot;.     Thefurther amendments necessary to carry into effect the proposal in paragraph 3 to, use a definite fraction are annexed.      it-will be seen that&apos; the title is now the &quot;Monopoly (Enquiry andControl)  Bill&quot; instead of the &quot;Monopolistic Practices Bill&quot;.The draft as amended is also being circulated to the legislation committee and, subject to Cabinet approved, will be consideredby that Committee on 23rd March with a view to the introductionof the Bill before the Easter Recess.H.M.Office of the Lord President    f the Council,Id .
