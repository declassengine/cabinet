(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret .P.(k&amp;)  1002nd April, 19u7.CABINET&quot;POLISH DAILY&quot;Memorandum by the Minister of Labour and National service the &quot;Polish Daily&quot;  is a daily newspaper printed inPolish mainly for members and ex-members of the PolishResettlement Corps.      Originally the paper was printed by aBritish firm employing British labour at the St.  Clements Press,but in November 19h7 it was transferred to other premises andhas been printed by a firm under Polish management who engagedPolish workers to do the printing work.      The matter on which i must trouble my colleagues concerns 12 Poles who are now employedunder Polish management in printing the newspaper.2. The facts leading up to the present position are asfollows.      My Department was in touch with the Unions and withdraw. Kirlcien-while the paper was being printed at the St.  Clement&apos; press.      When the printing was removed to other premises (CurtinRoad), the Unions were awere that Dr. Kirkien was proposing to engage Poles and that my Department would be supplying them inthe absence of available British labour.      An arrangement -wasmade between the Department and the Unions for the latter to be notified of the particulars of every Pole supplied by theDepartment and this was lone.      At this stage no question of conditions of work arose because the allocation of work among thevarious men had not been settled.3* Later in November discussions about wages and conditionstook place between the Unions and Dr. Kirkien.      No agreement wasreached and the Unions made representations to me that the Polesengaged in printing the paper were employed under conditionswhich did not conform to those agreed in the industry for dailynewspaper printing.      I thereupon arranged further meetings&quot;between the Unions and the management so that the matter could bediscussed and my Department has had meetings with both sidesseparately and a number of joint meetings in an endeavour to get a settlement.      Dr.  Kirkien has consistently said that they cannot afford to observe trade union conditions conforming with thosegenerally agreed in the case of doily newspapers and has made no attempt to reach a settlement.      The Unions on their part havebeen prepared to make concessions  (in my view substantial ones)but are not prepared to accept as satisfactory the conditionswhich are in operation.      A statement of the difference betweenthe Unions and&quot; the management was agreed in February when bothsides made it clear that they considered no further progress could be made.      I attach a copy of this statement as an Appendix.Since then there have been further talks but at a meeting betweenthe management. and the Unions on Tuesday,  30th March, no agreement was reached.COPY NO. -J w&apos;
U- I am satisfied that agreement is Impossible and that no-further effective action to obtain an agreed settlement is open tomy Deportment.5. The Unions consider that in allowing Poles to beemployed on the &quot;Polish Daily&quot; under conditions which do notConform to those agreed in the industry the Government is breaking the pledge given to the Trades Union Congress that Poles would only be submitted to vacancies provided that the wastes andconditions were not less favourable than those which would be offered to a British subject in a similar capacity.      They have requested that the Poles be withdrawn from employment with the&quot;Polish Daily&quot;.      So long as negotiations were proceeding andthere was a  possibility that Dr.  Kirfcien would be prepared to make changes to satisfy -the Unions that the conditions of employmentwere not unreasonably different from the recognised conditions inthe trade taking into account the special circumstances,  I did not feel it was necessary to withdraw the poles from employment onthe &quot;Polish Doily&quot;.      Since,  however,  it is now clear that agreement about the conditions of employment on these lines cannot beexpected and that the Poles ore being employed under con-ditionswhich do not conform to the agreed standards for British workersI consider that the Unions&apos;   request for withdrawal is justified.I must therefore ask that the Poles employed by the &quot;Polish Doily&quot;who are still on the Reserve of the polish Resettlement Corpsshould be recalled to the Corps.6. I appreciate that the withdrawal of these Poles may result in the &quot;Polish Daily&quot; closing down and thus deprive theForeign Office and other Government departments of a useful meansof circulating information to Poles in this country.      On theother hand the consequences of not recalling the Poles to thePolish Resettlement Corps are likely to be most serious.      the printing unions will undoubtedly argue that this is a directbreach of the Government pledge on the employment of poles andwill receive the support of other Unions and of the Trades UnionCongress.      This may well lead to developments which will make it extremely difficult to continue placing Poles still in the PolishResettlement Corps in industry and. may cause unrest in those industries where Poles have been successfully placed.      I have nodoubt that the recall of the Poles from the &quot;Polish Daily&quot; is inall the circumstances the best course.7. As my colleagues will be aware the General Secretaryof the London Society of Compositors informed the Stationery office on the 2prd March that his Society have decided to impose a completeembargo on all overtime worked in the Stationery Office- and inprinting offices under contract to the Stationery Office until thePoles employed by the &quot;Polish Doily&quot; ore withdrawn-      The embargocomes into operation from Friday, 9th April..     I have made it clear to the General Secretary of the London Society of Compositors thatthe Government cannot reach any decision as to the withdrawal of poles from the &quot;Polish Daily&quot; while this threat of on embargo is inforce and I understand that the Executive Committee -of the Societyis meeting today to consider the matter.      I hope that the stationery Office will be informed, within the next two days thatthe threat to impose the- embargo has been lifted.G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,3. w. 1 .2nd April,  19U8.-2-
appendixstatement of difference between the management of ths&quot;&quot;&quot;polish daily&quot; and&quot; the printing trade unionsThe-Trade Unions claim that wages and conditions for persons employed in the production of the &quot;Polish Daily&quot; should&quot;be based on the normal trade practice in the industry but having taken into full consideration the particular circumstances ofthe &quot;Polish Daily&quot; they are prepared to agree that the following conditions should apply:-(a) the staff employed to be not less than 1  reader;2 stereotypars;    U paper workers;    l\. &quot;Natsopa&quot;workers;    1 machine minder;    3 line operatorstogether with an adequate number of hand compositors;(b) the staff to be employed in accordance with the recognised conditions in the industry;    in particular the agreed practice for allocation of work as betweenthe different classes of workpeople should be strictly observed and there should be no variation in then, on a 1 w rr ki n g w e e k.The management indicate - that the. total number of personsemployed is 12 including maintenance staff as opposed to theUnions&apos;  total of approximately 20 excluding maintenance staff.The Paper was enabled to bo run on this reduced staff by requiringsetae &quot;of the workpeople to perform work appropriate to more thanone class and-by extending the normal working week.      Acceptanceof the Union basis of staffing would be too costly and wouldmean cessation of publication.
