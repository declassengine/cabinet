The practical questions which are touched upon in these notes are allreceiving consideration iriter-departmentally.P. C. G.-W.Commonwealth Relations Office,17th March, 1948.REPORT ON CEYLONGeneral1. Ceylon is settling down as a genuine Dominion. Present Ministers are extremely friendly and want to maintain and deepen the British connexion. they want, for instance, to preserve English as the official language in Parliament andcourts. They do not want Ceylon to be a Republic: in looking for a name to describe themselves they are inclined to favour &quot; Kingdom of Ceylon.&quot;Sehanayake is in the genuine tradition of Dominion Prime Ministers : deeply committed to the British connexion.2. The present Administration is firmly in the saddle and has, I think,been strengthened by the transfer of power. To quite an extent we can help thepresent Administration if we preserve the right approach to them. It is hardlytoo much to say that if we treat them strictly as a Dominion, they will behavevery like a loyal colony : whereas if we treat them as a Colony we may end indriving them out of the Commonwealth. For some time the tone in which weconduct our various negotiations will be extremely important. I think that all such negotiations should, therefore, be conducted by our High Commissioner or through the Commonwealth Relations Office.The Celebrations3. Two somewhat contradictory themes ran through the celebrations. First,there was real rejoicing at independence peacefully won in co-operation with britain. (This revealed itself in the official flying of the Union Jack side by side with the Lion Flag : the unofficial flying of quite a number of Union Jacks;the emphasis on royalty in the celebrations; the good will of the crowds towardsthe Duke; passages in the Prime Minister&apos;s speeches.) Simultaneously the othertheme was developed that independence was the outcome of a struggle for liberty; here Was even an undertone of talk about martyrs (evidence : the three versionsof my broadcast published in the papers all left out the passage about Ceylori&apos;independence being the mutual achievement of Ceylon and Britain; some youngofficials made remarks like &quot; the only permanent benefit from the Duke&apos;s visit35084
is that the roads have been improved &apos;&apos;; fairly widespread criticism about thecost of the celebrations 6 lakhs of rupees).4. The celebrations put royalty and the Duke right in the centre, and opposition to the Royal visit was limited. One man in the crowd produced aplacard &apos;&apos; Go back Gloucester &apos;&apos; : one village in the north flew black flags : afew slogans were stencilled on walls : &quot; Real, not fake, independence.&quot; I talked ,with all the opposition leaders and all of them said they were content to boycottthe celebrations and did not want to try and disorganise them or protest against them. The Communist M.P.s and the M.P.s of the two Trotskyite Parties stayedaway from the opening of Parliament but took up the seats allotted to themfor their friends and relatives.Defence5. Of the two contradictory themes the one of loyalty and rejoicing was far the more emphatic and dominant. The friendship of Ceylon for Britain,which was always strong, became stronger after 4th February. There is, however,a subdued note&apos; of doubt that is still to be overcome. It seemed to me thatthe root cause of this is the military agreement that was made a condition precedent of Dominion status. Why, it is asked by the opposition, was thisinsisted upon if it does not diminish independence? And Ministers do not findthis easy to answer.Our defence relations with Ceylon will depend upon mutual friendship and confidence : this cannot be written into a document and certainly cannot be forced out of Ceylon as the result of a document. On balance the Prime Ministerfavours as early talks on defence as possible.   His motives are : -(a) Doubt whether the existing Defence Agreement, which was agreed toby Ceylon before its independence, may not prejudice Ceylon&apos;s entry into the United Nations Organisation; and(6) His desire to get a firm defence agreement that will allay his fears aboutexcessive Indian influence in the affairs and future of Ceylon.It was not my intention to bring up this subject but it was immediately raised on their side.   The chief points are : (a) Ceylon will insist on the formal preservation and assertion of itssovereignty and would prefer unpublished agreements and assurancesto a Formal Treaty.(&amp;;) Ceylon is eager to get an extremely close military tie-up with us andwill in fact give us all we want, if the forms of sovereignty arepreserved.(c) We may have some bargaining to do about rent, &amp;c, for ground weuse : but I do not think they will try and pinch us too far.(d) They are not prepared to spend very much themselves on their own defence : and we may need to push them in this matter. They wantan independent force of their own but are thinking of a force only ,000 strong.(e) They want us to train Ceylonese in our military bases a,nd to raise Ceylonunits of the Imperial forces which can serve outside Ceylon.   they want the Pioneer Corps in Malaya to be continued.I am sure we can get all we want in the way of facilities for ourselvesif we make the right approach. Everything could be spoiled if we talkedto Ceylon as if it were a colony or dependency or as if we had rights in its territory. Any defence agreement we may make will depend upon the goodwill of the Government and people of Ceylon : we must assume this and can count on it. We must not attempt to substitute for it cast-iron concessions or extra-territorial rights.Confidential defence talks should, I am sure, be conducted very soon andby our High Commissioner to whom the military should act as expert advisers.Admission to the United Nations Organisation6. The successful entry of Ceylon into the United Nations organisation is of paramount importance, and is largely bound up with the Defence Agreement.The Prime Minister impressed this on me several times. If Ceylon fails and burma succeeds in getting into the United Nations Organisation the present government might be seriously shaken and might even be compelled, with theutmost reluctance, to leave the Commonwealth. Ceylon Ministers are alarmedabout Russia&apos;s possible attitude and use of the Veto.
7. The Ceylon Government is eager for us to give all possible advice and help to them about the best procedure for applying for membership of theUnited Nations. It will ease their minds if we can do this as fully, quickly and continuously as possible.India8. Relations with India play a leading part in Ceylon&apos;s policy. The PrimeMinister told me that he regarded the Indian problem as one of the two dangersfacing Ceylon (the other is the Left opposition).In part Ceylon fears Indian pressure and for this reason wants a closemilitary tie-up with us. They want to be treated on their merits and do not wish to come too closely within the Indian orbit.In part Ceylon fears economic and social pressure by Tamil immigration.This underlies the problem of Ceylon citizenship. India wants all the immigrantTamils from Madras to be full Ceylon citizens : there are some 800,000 of themand they are liable to increase. Ceylon wants to limit the number of these Tamilcitizens to about 400,000.Senanayake and Nehru have had conversations on this. They have agreed&quot;in principle&quot; but in fact left all the real issues to be settled &quot;as &quot;details.&quot;Senanayake has the impression that he and Nehru are pretty close in their ideas.I very much doubt it and I think that when Ceylon publishes its proposals theremay be quite sharp tension with India.  Senanayake feels strongly on this matter.The Opposition9.   The opposition in Ceylon consists of two quite distinct sections.One is the Tamil Congress, which represents the resident Tamils (not to beconfused with the immigrant Tamils described above) and is strong in the north of the island. It is not against Senanayake on social or economic issues, but is against him as a Sinhalese. I was told that there are good chances that the TamilCongress will join the Government, getting two seats in the Cabinet.The other section of the opposition consists of three Marxist parties orLeftists as they are commonly called.There is a Communist party with 3 seats (out of 95) and two Trotskyiteparties (one with 10 seats, one with 5). All are led by ex-officers of the Oxford orCambridge Union. I talked with the leaders of these parties. The differences between them are very subtle and theoretical. The Communist party of coursefollows Russia over the Marshall Plan, but its detailed local policy is really indis-tinguishable from that of the two Trotsky parties :  they speak for the pooragainst the rich; demand land reforms; put forward constant claims for wage increases; and stand for &quot;genuine&quot; independence. The only difference that i could detect between the two Trotsky parties (apart from acute personal differ-ences) is that the smaller of the two accepts the lead of the Trotsky party inMadras, whilst the other refuses to. It seems probable that the two Trotskyparties will one day unite. The differences with the Communist party are of courseunbridgeable and a serious source of weakness to the Left. There are a fewBikkhus or Buddhist priests associated with the Trotsky parties; but this is not animportant factor.10. These Left parties do represent and reflect a serious social problem.They are a danger in the sense that if Ceylon comes a cropper it would take theform of very serious social upheaval; just as if India came a cropper it wouldreveal itself in communal anarchy. I do not think the Left parties are an immi-nent danger though they will continue for a considerable time, as the causes of thesocial discontent that has given rise to them are deep-rooted.Social and Economic Problems11. Socially, Ceylon is a mixture of feudalism and Eighteenth Centurylanded aristocracy. There is relatively little caste and practically no communaltension. In the middle of the island, especially in the old kingdom of Kandy,something very close to feudalism has survived.Apart from the Left leaders, every politician is an extremely rich landownerwith local power and influence comparable to a Whig landlord in George IIFstime. They have much the same attitude towards politics. Public life is riddledwith affable and open corruption, moral and otherwise.These Whig landlords have honestly led a political campaign for independencebut they have very little idea of social progress. They tend to be terrified by the left opposition which they do not understand; they regard it as a monstrousand wicked violation of the natural order and, if it grew, would be tempted to
suppress it. Their spontaneous reaction is to combat Marxism with Buddhismand thev are spending a good deal on this propaganda. Buddhism (and theCatholicism in the coastal area north of Colombo) are indeed very powerfulbarriers to the advance of the parties of the Left. Nevertheless it is in just these areas that they have won their successes; they have some influence amongst theTamil immigrants (who are however run by powerful and unscrupulous bossesof their own who are also money-lenders); they have made no impression at all ,on the resident Tamil population of the north.Fairly elaborate programmes of social reform have been launched by theGovernment especially in education, hospitals and the like. Indeed these schemes may well be beyond the economic resources of the island. Such measures will not however remove the real causes of social discontent. The standards ofcleanliness, education and village housing are already considerably higher thanin India; but social discontent is also more serious than in India.The main cause of discontent is the fragmentation of the ownership of land which has gone to fantastic lengths. Eight people will have a share in one acre ofpaddy-field or in a handful of coconut trees. Three separate families will havethe right to cultivate a. given field in successive years. The result is either areluctance to work the land at all because so many people have contingent claimsupon the produce or feverish exploitation to get out as much as possible during theyear of cultivation.For this there is no remedy but to make more land available and to give it incompensation for loss of present rights in parcels of land. Under the stimulus ofthe Prime Minister considerable progress is being made in reducing jungle topaddy-field by digging irrigation canals (all this jungle was rich land a thousandor two thousand years ago). The work is held up by lack of bulldozers, scoops, etc.Half-a-dozen more would enable the work to be greatly speeded up. Colonisation,as it is called, of these new settlements is said to be very corruptly done; but theessential thing is that new families are being settled.12. Jungle-clearance, however, cannot do the trick fast enough. Some landswill have to be expropriated and resettled if the causes of social discontent are tobe removed. Over this there is likely to be a sharp division in the Cabinet. Thechief leader of a forward policy is Bandaranaike, commonly talked of asSenanayake&apos;s successor and another product of the Oxford Union. Himself alawyer, he will find it hard to convince his land-owning colleagues. He talked to meabout the possibility of resignation if he does not get his way.13. A.further cause of social discontent is a certain amount of unemploy-ment. The ultimate remedy can only be the development of some simple secondary industries. Some remedy might be found in a reduction of the Tamil immigrantpopulation and this is one of the main motives behind Bandaranaikes&apos;s extremeanti-Indian policy. The unemployment problem doubtless underlies the eagernessthat we should raise Ceylon units of the Imperial Forces. If, as seems likely,there is not enough money both for large land reform and re-employment measures and for major social reforms Ceylon should give preference to the first. Theremoval of economic discontent is her most pressing problem.14. A great need in Ceylon is a genuine radical Labour Movement based onproper Trade Unions. Anything we could do to forward this would be in our interests. I put forward the suggestion that batches of workers might come fromCeylon to England to learn about modern Trade Unions and industrial practice.The idea was welcomed and any proposal we could make would be eagerly taken up.15. If no serious land reforms are undertaken the Left Parties will remainof some importance, though I doubt whether they will make electoral headway.The United National Party is beginning for the first time to take local organisa-tion seriously. Buddhism and Catholicism will become increasingly stubbornobstacles to Marxism. If reforms were undertaken, the Marxist opposition would cease to be serious : but this would be a slow process.16. I was impressed by the keenness and efficiency of a number of youngGovernment officials I met. These should in due course somewhat improve the standards of administrative morality in the island.17. I was also deeply impressed by the good start made by the HighCommissioner and his skeleton staff. They have immediately hit off the righttone for a Dominion and have won the confidence of the key officials and civilservants.March, 1948P. C. G.-W.
