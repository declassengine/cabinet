Printed for the Cabinet, April, 1948CP. (48) 1132jth April, 1948TOP secret the circulation of this   paper  has been strictly   limited.    It   is   issued   for   the personal use of copy No.  30CABINETRESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THEFORMER ITALIAN COLONIES IN africa memorandum BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WARIn 1941, when operational developments made it apparent that certain enemy territories in North Africa were likely to be overrun by British military forces, it wasdecided by the War Cabinet that the War Office should be the department responsiblefor the administration of such territories. With the exception of the British Zone ofGermany and Austria (the responsibility for the administration of which territories was subsequently transferred to the Foreign Office) this policy has been adhered to with theresult that responsibility for the administration of the former Italian Colonies in Africa(Tripolitania, Cyrenaica, Eritrea and Italian Somaliland) still rests with the Secretaryof State for War.2. Up till comparatively recently this arrangement gave rise to no major difficultiesbut, since the middle of 1946 when the future disposal of these territories came up fordiscussion in the Council of Foreign Ministers, it has become apparent that the systemof direction of these administrations from London is faulty. Three separate departments of State are concerned and policy is continually changing. The system whereby theForeign Office (in consultation to some extent with the Colonial Office) formulates policy,while the War Office implements, or endeavours to implement, that policy locally andis responsible for such repercussions as may arise is daily proving itself to be unworkable.3. This problem has been under consideration in the Libya Committee which hasprepared the attached paper which sets out:  (a) the War Office case for handing over responsibility for the administration ofthese territories to the Foreign Office forthwith and(b) the Foreign Office case for the retention of the status quo.   This paper hasbeen seen by the Foreign Secretary and agreed by the Foreign Office represen-tatives on the Libya Committee.4. I have to request that a decision upon this question of future responsibility forthe administration of these ex-Italian Colonies may be given as a matter of urgency.5. It should be noted that, whichever way the decision may go, the existing MilitaryAdministrations will have to be wholly civilianized during the course of this year. Atpresent some two-thirds of the staff of the Administrations are military officers holdingemergency commissions, who must all be released from military service before31st December, 1948. Action is already in hand to retain the services of as many of these officers as possible as civilians under temporary contracts.E.S.The War Office,27th April, 1948.
DEPARTMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF THEFORMER ITALIAN colonies. The question of departmental responsibility for the administration of the formerItalian Colonies has been under discussion in the Libya Committee, and separatelybetween the Departments concerned, namely the War Office, the Colonial Office andthe Foreign Office. Consideration turned (a) on the period following an internationaldecision as to the future of these Colonies and (&amp;) on the period between now and thatdecision.2. With regard to (a) it has been agreed that as soon as an international decision infavour of United Kingdom trusteeship has been reached (or when the U.N. Assembly has failed to reach a decision and the United Kingdom continues as occupying Power), WarOffice administration would in any case have to make way for administration either by theForeign Office or by the Colonial Office. As regards Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, it wasagreed at the Committee level that it would on balance be preferable that the ForeignOffice rather than the Colonial Office should assume ultimate responsibility. As regardsEritrea and Italian Somaliland, no decision has been reached as to whether the ForeignOffice or the Colonial Office would be the most suitable Department (if such aneventuality should arise).3. As regards (b) the intervening period before any international decision is reached no agreement has been reached between the Departments concerned, and the LibyaCommittee has invited the Secretariat to prepare the present paper, setting out the con-siderations involved, for submission to higher authority. The hypothesis on which thearguments are based is a Cabinet decision (CM. (48) 12th Conclusions, Minute 2)(which may not be irrevocable) that His Majesty&apos;s Government ,should work for an ordinary trusteeship of Libya and should support the Italian claim to the trusteeship of italian Somaliland and of the bulk of Eritrea. The decision as regards the Italian claim is important in the present discussion since it involves a serious risk of provoking civilcommotion in part at least of the territories concerned.4. The War Office are anxious, as soon as practicably possible, say on 1st May, 1948,to relinquish responsibility for the administration of the former Italian Colonies. Itis generally accepted that the Colonial Office could not, in any case, properly take overthe administration until international agreement was reached on the future disposalof the Colonies as such a step would be held to savour of annexation. If the immediaterelinquishment by the War Office of these responsibilities were agreed to, there would,therefore, be no alternative but for the Foreign Office to accept the responsibility atany rate up to the date of an international decision of principle. Both the ForeignOffice and the Colonial Office consider, however, that it would be preferable for WarOffice responsibility to continue during the interim period until a decision of principle is reached in the U.N. Assembly (as it may be at this autumn&apos;s session). That is theproblem in its simplest expression, but it is complicated by:  (a) uncertainty as to the date of an international decision of principle, which might take place this autumn but might on the contrary be dela3&apos;ed until theAssembly in the autumn of 1949.(b) international considerations;(c) internal political considerations within the colonies concerned;(d) threat of civil commotion;(e) staffing problems.   These latter are not introduced into the following discussion,as it is appreciated that they would be common to either administrativeauthority.5. The War Office Case.The War Office desire to relinquish responsibility immediately rests on the followingarguments; which they consider to be irrefutable, particularly in view of the fact thatthey are the only department with first hand knowledge of the problem and difficulties involved.(i) While the occupying force was quite capable of administering these territorieson a basis of care and maintenance, it is not equipped to administer them on the basis of the economic and social expansion which has now beenembarked upon at least in Cyrenaica for political reasons.(ii) During the operational period and even as late as May, 1946. when discussions on the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty opened in Paris, internationalpolitical questions had little effect upon the day-to-day administration ofthese territories. Since that date, however,&apos; the political aspect hasincreasingly overshadowed all others until the point has been reached wherethe existing system is proving itself to be unworkable.The War Office represent that the continued allocation of responsibilityfor political policy and responsibility for administration to two separatedepartments makes it increasingly difficult to ensure that the impact of
the one function upon the other is given sufficient consideration. Inview of the importance of the issues involved and in the light of the increasedtempo at which events are developing, a continuance of the present arrange-ments will increase the difficulties and dangers in any case inherent in theexisting situation.(iii) The civilian populations of the territories concerned have since 1946 feltincreasingly resentful of the fact that they are still being retained under aMilitary Administration so long after the close of hostilities. If the adminis-tration were civilianized the local population would regard this as a greatstep forward. Such action would, in the opinion of the War Office, also havea good effect on world opinion which would regard the termination of our military Administrations as a relaxation in our hold on these territories andindicate the adoption of a more progressive policy.(iv) A change of policy such as that suggested would be welcomed by the personnel of the administration in the field (the overwhelming majority of whomwill have to be individually civilianized in the course of this year) as indicating a recognition of one of the major difficulties with which they are confronted and the intention to remove it. The War Office state that civilian-ization in the course of this year would not in itself have any deleterious effecton the staffing position in the territories.(v) The War Office do not consider that the risk of civil commotion has a pro-found bearing on the question, since the available troops would be on theground in any case, and could be called on by the Civil Governor whowould, in fact, be less embarrassed than a dual purpose Military-cum-CivilGovernor in such circumstances.(vi) In view of the agreement referred to in paragraph 2 (a) and of the furtheragreement that where we hope to obtain trusteeship we must depart from the care and maintenance policy now, it is important that the new department should take over now on the inception of the new policy. Any delay would open the way for the argument that to effect a change within a reasonablyshort period of an anticipated international decision would be unwise.(vii) That a reorganization to deal with the new policy is necessary now and shouldbe undertaken by the department which is ultimately to be responsible inorder to avoid the confusion which would be caused by further changes ata later date.(viii) That all the objections against a change now could be advanced with equalforce against a change being made at any time before a decision is finallyreached by the United Nations and that if the change is not effected now allthe disadvantages of divided control and dual responsibility may persist fora long time and that in such circumstances we cannot hope to get full value from the new policy.6. The War Office undertake that in the event of any change in responsibility, theywill give every assistance in their power towards the provision of such staff as are qualified and could be made available, including the existing staffs now employed inthis work in the War Office in London. They wish to point out, however, that under theterms of general demobilization all emergency commissioned officers must be released from the army before the end of 1948 and their retention in a civilian capacity largelydepends on their willingness to accept new contracts and on the nature of the contracts.7. The Foreign Office Case.The Foreign Office take the view that the difficulties to which the War Office call attention are not primarily due to the division of responsibility between the War Officeand the Foreign Office but are inherent in a change in the international factors which now have a bearing on the problem. They consider that the following objections to animmediate transfer of responsibility are overriding:  (i) Any change in administration at this particular juncture, whilst the matter issub-judice in the C.F.M. and the Assembly, would be seized on and mis-represented by nations hostile to the United Kingdom as an indication thatwe propose to establish ourselves in the territories without regard to the future international decision. Their propaganda could be counted on to make themost of any such move. The margin of support for our plans in the assembly will in any case be very narrow and we cannot afford to take any step thatmight lose us even a small number of votes,(ii) Whatever the ultimate result, the immediate effect of any change is likely inthe view of the Foreign Office to be unsettling to our administration in thefield, and to the local inhabitants, both of which consequences would be most undesirable at this critical period.
As civil commotion seems very likely in the event of an international decisionfavourable to the Italians (or even as soon as it became known that either the United Kingdom or the United States of America were likely to suppor tsuch a decision) there is a strong case for the maintenance of a military administration. Potential disturbers of the peace would be unlikely to appreciate the point made by the War Office that a civilian administration would, in fact, be as well equipped to handle trouble as a military one.It is to be hoped that by the end of this year an international decision, at least of principle, will have been 1 cached regarding most or all former italian colonies. To await that decision before making administrative changes might enable us to avoid making a difficult change over at least in Eritrea andItalian Somaliland for a very short period.8. At the same time the Foreign Office would be very ready to consider sympathetic-thetically any suggestion for any modification of the present machinery which mightimprove its functioning while not arousing international criticism.Summary.q. The Departments concerned are agreed at the Committee level that as soon asan international decision of principle in favour of United Kingdom trusteeship has beenreached (or when the U.N. Assembly has failed to agree), administration would inany case be taken over by the Foreign Office as regards Cyrenaica (or Libya as a whole),and by the Foreign Office or the Colonial Office as regards any other territories.10. The War Office urge that, a,s soon as is practicably possible, they should relinquished-quish responsibility for the administration of the Former Italian Colonies.n. The Foreign Office suggest that responsibility should continue with the WarOffice during the interim period.Views of other Departments represented on the Working Parly12. The Colonial Office share the Foreign Office point of view on a basis of 7 (i)and (iv) above.13. The Treasury are also in agreement with Foreign Office view.14. Although the Admiralty and Air Ministry have no direct interests in theproblem, on balance they support the War Office case.(B.;S/iGl)    100   4/48   W.O.P.    29602
