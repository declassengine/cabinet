THIS  DOCUMENT  IS  THE PROPERTY OF   HIS  BRITANNIC  MAJESTY*S  GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1948CONFIDENTIALCopy No.30CP. (48) 11428th April 1948CABINETDEVELOPMENT IN IRAQMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information of my colleagues a note summarising thepresent position as regards development work in Iraq, together with notes byMr. L. Waight, the Financial Adviser attached to the British Middle East Office,on a recent visit he paid to the Tennessee Valley Authority (Annex A) and ona conversation with the International Bank (Annex B). Mr. Waight&apos;s namehas been submitted to the Iraq Government as candidate for the post of EconomicAdviser to the Central Development Board which they are being urged to set up.Present political and financial conditions in Iraq do not make it possible to expect any notable progress in these matters in the immediate future. Electionsare expected to be held next month and as soon as a new Government is estab-lished we will urge them to resume the plans for development work as quickly as possible. Meanwhile useful technical work is proceeding and, as Mr. Ffaigh&apos;plans for the major schemes of flood control and irrigation will not in any casefee ready until about September, we may hope that the present delay need notnecessarily retard the realisation of the programme.1. Iraq offers greater possibilities for economic development at present than any other Middle Eastern country. It is estimated that the area at present under cultivation could be potentially expanded, both by irrigation and by the develop-ment of the rainfall zone in Northern Iraq, from the present figure of under6 million acres to some 30 million acres. The energetic development of theseagricultural resources will (a) enable Iraq to become a great food-producing country for the middle east, which is at present a net importer of cereals;(b) enable Iraq to support a considerably larger population than her presentpopulation of 4-^ millions, which is, in fact, barely sufficient to main-tain the area already cultivated unless greater mechanisation is introduced;(c) broaden the basis of Iraq&apos;s economic prosperity by enabling her to deriveprofit, not only from her oil resources, but also from all her cultivableland;(d) provide a unique opportunity in the Middle East not only for raising the present very low standards of living of the labouring classes, butalso for introducing modern democratic forms of land ownership and management on a large scale; andE. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 128th April, 1948.memorandum the ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF IRAQ35288b
(e) give Iraq the basis for that economic prosperity which will assist her to achieve real political progress and stabilty, and thus provide the best possible answer to subversive criticism of the present regime.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government^ aim has therefore been to stimulate and encourage the Iraqis to embark on a comprehensive programme of economic and social development and to assist this programme to the fullest extent possible,by the provision of British technical man-power and capital equipment. Underthe current Treaty of 1930 the Iraqis are bound to turn to us in the first instancefor their foreign technical advisers, and although they find this treaty obligationsomewhat irksome, they have (unlike other Middle Eastern countries) shown .them-selves genuinely anxious to secure British assistance in this respect rather thanthat of other foreign Powers. Since, however, it is not possible for us single-handed to meet Iraq&apos;s full requirements, either of man-power or of equipment,we have considered it essential to seek the close co-operation of the americans in this matter, and preliminary consultations have already been held with theState Department.3. The progress made during the past two years may be summarised asfollows : (i) Early in 1946 Mr. F. F. Haigh was appointed by the Iraqi government as head of a British Irrigation Commission to undertake a compre-hensive study of the river system of Iraq and to prepare plans for major flood control and irrigation works. This Commission beganwork in the autumn of 1946, and has now prepared plans for works which will result in (a) ensuring complete flood control of the Tigris and Euphrates; and(b) bringing some 9-g- million acres under cultivation through irrigation-tion development.It is estimated that flood control can be achieved in 3-4 years&apos; time,but that it will be at least 6-8 years before the major irrigationschemes can come into operation. The total cost of these works isestimated at  15 millions, of which some  5 millions would be spenton imported equipment and materials. So far the Iraqi Governmenthas agreed only to one project costing  1-8 millions,(ii) In April 1947 the Iraqi Government under Saleh Jabr held a seriesof consultations with the British Ambassador and the British middle east Office, regarding the formulation of a comprehensive developmentpolicy aimed at ensuring that the irrigation schemes described above are related to a carefully balanced assessment of the agriculturalproblems and possibilities involved, and co-ordinated at every stagewith the development of health, transport, education and social services. As a result of these consultations proposals were agreed for (a) the establishment of planning sections in each Iraqi GovernmentDepartment concerned with development in order to preparedetailed projects;(b) the establishment of a Central Development Board (which would include a foreign administrator of the highest calibre) to co-ordinate and approve the projects submitted by the planningsections; this Board would be non-political and would remainin being while Governments came and went;(c) the appointment of Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners as consultantsto the planning sections and to the Central Board; and(d) the appointment of a large number of British experts to assistthe planning sections and the Central Board.No action has, however, so far been taken by the Iraqis on (a) and (b).Sir Alexander Gibb &amp; Partners have prepared for the Iraqi Govern-ment a &quot; plan to make a plan,&quot; but this has, as far as we know, beenpigeon-holed. As regards (d), however, a list of nearly 100agricultural engineering and medical experts required was received in June, 1947. Since that date 46 names have been submitted, of whom17 have been appointed; while 13 posts have been cancelled. a candidate for the key post of Adviser to the Central development board is also available on secondment from the Treasury.    Our
Embassy has, of course, been pressing the Iraqis to set up the CentralDevelopment Board and to take an early decision regarding the candidates outstanding; but the present Caretaker Government isreluctant, for political reasons, to take any decision on these matters and no progress is likely until after the elections, which are expectedto be held in May or June.(iii) The Agricultural, Animal Husbandry and Health Advisers attachedto the British Middle East Office have, during the past two years,made several visits to Iraq and their advice has been generally welcomed. The work of the Statistical Adviser, who has set up a central Statistical Office for the Iraqi Government and re-organisedthe statistical sections of all the Iraqi Government Departments, hasbeen particularly successful. The Labour Adviser has, however,been prevented by circumstances outside his control from spendingany length of time in Iraq. This is unfortunate since the Iraqis areat present lagging behind even Persia and Egypt in the developmentof their labour policy and legislation (no action whatsoever has beentaken yet to draw up national social insurance schemes, to establishminimum wage rates or to promote trade unions) and with the risingcost of living and current shortage of bread there are signs now ofimminent labour unrest In the sphere of labour alone, moreover, theIraqis have not so far agreed to appoint any foreign advisers. Thereis therefore a strong case for a resident British Labour Attacheat Bagdad and this is under consideration.The British Middle East Office are now working out proposalswhich we shall in due course press the Iraqis to accept, for theorganisation of land tenure and management and production in the newly cultivated areas. In this connexion the Americans havesuggested that a Tigris-Euphrates Authority, modelled on the T.V.A.,should be formed. The T.V.A. is not, however, considered a suitableprototype by our experts since it is based largely on the principleof private land ownership and makes no provision for the partner-ship of the labouring classes or for communal social services. TheSudan Development Schemes are considered a far more suitable model.(iv) Assuming that the plans for irrigation, railway and other development projects which have so far been considered are pressed aheadenergetically, it is estimated that the total expenditure during thenext five years may amount to about  30 millions of which  11-13millions would be required in foreign exchange for the purchase of equipment abroad. Under the sterling balance agreement concluded with Iraq in 1947, we agreed to make available  15 millions inforeign exchange for expenditure on capital development during thefive years up to 1951. It is estimated that during this period theIraqis will obtain a further  12 millions from Oil Company expendi-ture. At present, however, these sums cannot be converted into dollarssince we are not able to allocate dollars to Iraq to meet more than herminimum current consumer needs. From the financial point of view,therefore, it is important that Iraq should procure as much of hercapital equipment requirements as possible from the United Kingdom,and we are accordingly pressing the Iraqis to prepare a DevelopmentBudget (this was promised for last December but has not yet material-ised) and a detailed inventory of their requirements, in order that thesupply position may be fully examined here. For the purchase ofsuch equipment as cannot be made available from sterling areasources, the Iraqis will have to have recourse to a loan from theInternational Bank. Preliminary consultations with the Bank havealready been held.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,April, 194835288
ANNEX ATENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITYSome Impressions of a Recent VisitNote by Mr. L. WaightIn a land where the majority of the people seem to prefer private enterpriseto socialism, it is astonishing to find such a successful organisation as the T.V.A.,which, to my mind, is not only practical Christianity, but also in essence socialism.This paradox is hard to explain and very few of the Americans I have metwill openly admit its existence.Four and a half days in Tennessee and North Carolina are quite inadequate to obtain more than a general impression of the structure, methods of administra-tion and operations, and the activities of T.V.A. Nevertheless, during that perioddiscussions with directors, executives and heads of departments, technicians and numerous other people in and outside of TV.A., visits to three of the twenty-seven dams, and to several test-demonstration farms, provided enough backgroundfor the forming of impressions and the making of some judgments.It is impossible to leave the area where the TV.A. operates without being-very considerably impressed and without making the resolve to visit it again ifthe opportunity offers.The purpose of T.V.A. and what it has accomplished during the fourteenyears of its existence are sufficiently well known to make it unnecessary to describethem in detail in this short paper. Nor is it the intention to quote a mass of figures illustrating the success or otherwise of the T.V.A. in its many activities.The three main functions of T.V.A. are flood control, navigation and power development. That is the order of priority from which the T.V.A. neverdeparts. When water in the Tennessee river and its tributaries approachesdangerous levels (which is possible in spite of the mass of stored water behind the dams), power generation by hydro-electric means (which, of course, releaseswater) is closed down so as to leave room in the river for the water coming down from the water shed. When that happens stand-by steam generating plants are brought into use to provide the essential power required until the danger pointin the river has passed. Except for one low-lying point at Chattanooga, floodingdoes not now occur in the Tennessee Valley, which means an enormous saving inhuman lives, grain and livestock.The secondary objective of TV.A. navigation of the Tennessee river has been achieved. Before TV.A., this river was navigable for only short periods of the year and for short distances. Since the construction of the dams theTennessee river is navigable the whole year round and for a distance of 640 miles.The improvement in the economy of the States concerned (T.V.A. operates in sevenStates) through this achievement alone is enormous.The generation of hydro-electric power has progressed at a rapid pace andalthough progress was quickened by war needs (the atomic bomb plants in thevalley consumed enormous quantities of electrical power), the rise in consumptionfor peace-time uses has absorbed the output formerly generated for war purposes.Saturation point, however, has not yet been reached and the TV.A. is hardpressed to keep pace with current demands and those additional demands likelyto arise during the next five years. The initial price per electrical unit was over 6 cents, it is now a little over 1 cent, at which price T.V.A. is able tomeet the service on its debt to the Government and make a profit. The return on money expended is estimated at about 5 per cent. T.V.A. has proved that by lowering the price of the unit more electricity is used and more uses are found for it.Out of these three main functions of T.V.A. there spring several subsidiaryand complementary services such as the production of fertilisers, soil conserva-tion and development, reafforestation, land reclamation, community development and fish and wild life development. In all these spheres, T.V.A. has achievedremarkable results.The phosphates produced by T.V.A. are distributed free to farmers who will use these and other fertilisers according to plans prepared by T.V.A. and designedto cure or prevent soil erosion. In places where a few short years ago the land was bleeding to death through improper farm methods, the land has now beenhealed by more scientific farming, by greater use of fertilisers, and by reversion to cover crops instead of row crops where such crops have proved so ruinous to
the land. Young trees in millions are being planted to increase the water-holdingcapacity of the land and to provide useful timber in the future. The lakes formed by the dams now provide abundant supplies of fish.Most of the dams constructed are situated in areas where nature has beenprodigal in beauty and the concrete monsters set within such beauty do not marthat grandeur. In some places they enhance the view. The original constructioncamps at the dams were designed with much foresight so that at the end of theperiod of construction such sites can be turned over to townships. These townshipsare now delightful holiday resorts at extremely cheap rates administered under government auspices.The relations between the management and labour of T.V.A. appear toan outsider to be excellent. The T.V.A. observes whatever arrangements concerningwage rates, conditions of service, &amp;c, are entered into by the representatives of organised labour and industrial management in the area served by T.V.A.In the vast country served by T.V.A. man has co-operated with nature and nature has responded with an abundance that has to be seen to be believed. the countryside is. now good and beautiful to look upon instead of being an uglinessthat sears the beholder because it was so unnecessary. Animals reared on the farms respond, too, and are fine to look at and the families living on such farmsare healthy, happy and contented people believing in the good earth and above all in themselves.All the unities are preserved the unities of &quot; soil and water, land andriver, people and their resources &quot; and in preserving these unities a richer andfuller life lies within reach of all those in the Tennessee valley. The peoplebelieve in T.V.A.; it permeates their whole life and every one in the area,consciously or unconsciously, strives for the furtherance of T.V.A. ideals. Thejrbelieve that the life made possible for them by T.V.A. is the kind of life all men were meant to live and their own successful achievements assure them thatif men will only work together with this common aim a life such as they enjoyis possible for all men everywhere.Highly qualified technicians who could earn much higher salaries elsewherethan in T.V.A. prefer to remain for the greater personal satisfaction they enjoyin their work with T.V.A. These and all others employed in T.V.A. have a spirit in their work and a faith in the organisation to which they belong, $the equal of which is hard to find anywhere. They go about their work ascrusaders believing that in their valley they are achieving the nearest thing toa heaven on earth.It is difficult to avoid these superlatives : nevertheless the present writerconsiders that in T.V.A. the economists&apos;, the engineers&apos; and the social workers&apos;dreams have come true.But the value of the T.V.A. visit to the present writer (who may be concerned as Economic Co-coordinator with a similar project on a much, much smaller scale in Irak) lies not only in the more obvious facets of T.V.A. but in the administrativemethods and practices and the spirit with which the whole administration ispermeated.If only one-twentieth part or even one-fiftieth part of T.V.A. success is reproduced in Irak what a grand thing it would be for Irak and for the world.(Signed) LEONARD WAIGHT.March 1948.-ANNEX BDiscussions with the International Bank concerning IraqNote by Mr. L. WaiyhtDuring my recent visit to Washington I took the opportunity, with Treasuryconsent, to discuss with Mr. McCloy, Dr. Walter Hill and Mr. Mannigan of theInternational Bank the question of Iraq economic developments and more particu-larly the possibility of Iraq borrowing from the Bank at some stage.I prefaced my enquiries by saying that my discussions must be regarded asinformal as I was still the Treasury Representative in the Middle East, and addedthat my name was under consideration by the Iraqi Government for the post of Economic Co-coordinator of the Central Development Board when that Board
is set up. I informed them that in view of this possible appointment I thoughtit would be useful if I took advantage of my presence in Washington to discussinformally with them the prospects of Iraq obtaining a loan at some future date to finance the capital works programme envisaged. I emphasised that Iwas not yet connected in any way with the Iraqi Government and nothing Ihad to say could be taken as reflecting the views of that Government. The discus-sions proceeded on these understandings.  Mr. Figgures was present throughout.These officials were aware of the broad plan of proposed economic developmentof Iraq, and in particular, of the project for flood control and land reclamation.In principle they thought the plan itself was sound but of course much more detailed information would be required before the Bank could give it theirblessing and many aspects would have to be considered before the Bank decidedto make a loan. With these reservations, I was informed that the Bank would look most sympathetically upon an application from Iraq for a loan for suchconstructive purposes as was suggested. It was for purposes of the kind suggestedthat the Bank, inter alia, was set up. They urged, however, that Iraq should approach the matter in a business-like way and regard the application for a loanas a business transaction and avoid the approach adopted by some other countries whose attitude seems to be : &quot; Here is a Bank anxious to lend dollars. Let&apos;sborrow as many as we can and then see how we can spend it.&quot; The Bank isnot interested in that sort of thing and would not be unless it was desired to commit suicide.They would like to be informed in detail of the general plan of development,the priorities in the programme, the objectives to be achieved and their economicjustification, the estimated finance required with internal and external expendi-ture stated separately, the labour required and whether or not locally available,the estimate of time required to complete the programme in whole and in its various parts, proposals for servicing the debt, details of the GovernmentBudget, estimated revenue and expenditure of the projects when completed, anddetails of any assets that could be pledged or any revenue that could be earmarkedas security, for the loan, &amp;c, &amp;c. All this information and probably much more would be required and assessed before the Board of the Bank reached any decisionon a loan to Iraq. They may also stipulate, if it is decided to grant a loan, to makeit in stages as the works progressed.Mr. McCloy thought it would be a very good thing if the Iraqi Government,through the Central Development Board, kept in touch with the international bank if it was the intention to apply for a loan at a later stage. The Bankcould be kept informed, by informal letters if necessary, with developments inIraq and in turn would keep the Board informed of the Bank&apos;s requirements and from time to time make suggestions for the presentation of Iraq&apos;s case whichwould facilitate a final decision by the Bank. Dr. Walter Hill suggested that ifI am appointed to the post as envisaged it would be profitable to both sides if Icorresponded with him informally from time to time.In thanking them for the information and advice given to me I added that Iwould bear it in mind and would make use of it in the event of the appointmentfalling to me. I again emphasised my position in the discussions so as to leave them in no doubt that I was there solely in a personal capacity.March, 1948.(Signed)LEONARD WAIGHT.
