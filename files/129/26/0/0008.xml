After receiving the report of the Alternates, the Plenary Committee at its second session adopted, for transmission to the United States government by myself as Chairman of the Conference, a report setting out the progressachieved in European Economic Co-operation since the first meeting of the Com-mittee of European Economic Co-operation in Paris in the summer of 1947, and took note of the comments of the Technical Committees on the United StatesCommodity Reports on food and agriculture, fuel and power, iron and steel,inland and maritime transport, and timber. The Secretary-General of theConference was instructed to make these comments available to the participating countries and to the United States Embassy in Paris. The Conference further agreed that the Combined United States-United Kingdom Zone and the french zone of Germany should be regarded as independent participating areas and thatthey should both be signatories of the proposed Multilateral Agreement betweenthe participating countries. The Conference finally agreed to the establishmentof a Working Party (a) to consider the purpose, aims, functions and structure of a continuing organisation of the Committee of European Economic Co-operation;(&amp;) to prepare a draft Multilateral Agreement; and(c) to prepare for a reconvening of the Committee of European economic co-operation at a date to be decided later.4.

The texts of the resolution on Germany and the resolution giving theterms of reference of the Working Party are attached as Annexes A and Brespectively to this paper.The Committee of Alternates6. It was hoped, before the Conference met, that the Ministerial meeting would not last for more than two days and that it would be followed by at mosta further two days consultation between the Alternates. In spite of the importance35137
of the Agenda, the Conference worked with impressive speed and we were ableto keep to the proposed time-table. After the end of the Plenary Meetings, theAlternates agreed upon a further instruction to the Working Party on the purposes,aim and structure of the Continuing Organisation.   The text is at Annex C.7. Although the Eire Foreign Minister could not refrain from mentioningthe unification of Eire or the Portuguese Foreign Minister the desirability ofwelcoming Spain into the fold, I was particularly encouraged both by the Helpfulnote struck by the speeches of the chief delegates, including those of some countrieswhich might have been expected to be more reserved. The willingness of delegates to waive lesser differences in favour of speed and co-operation was also a most satisfactory feature of the meeting.8. I should like in conclusion to express my appreciation of the valuableservices again rendered by Sir O. Franks at this meeting and also of the goodwork of those responsible for the preparation of the Paris meeting.E. B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1.1st April, 1948.report at the invitation of M. Bidault and myself the representatives of the sixteencountries participating in the European Recovery Programme reassembled in Parison 15th March for a short meeting of the Committee of European economic co-operation with the following agenda : (a) To consider and approve the report by the Secretary-General of the paris conference on co-bperatioh between  the  participating countries,mentioned in paragraph 3 above.(&amp;) To receive the reports prepared by the chairmen of the technical com-mittees on the Commodity Reports tabled by the Uriitfed StatesAdmihistratidn.(c) To constitute and frame terms of reference for a working party consistingof representatives of the sixteen Governments.2. His Majesty&apos;s Government and the French Government later invited the member-countries to agree to the addition of a further item to the agenda cdii-cerning the participation of the zones of occupation of Western Germany inthe work of the C.E.E.C.3. The Governments concerned all indicated their intention of being repre-sented by their Foreign Ministers, with the exception of Switzerland and Iceland.In the event fourteen Foreign Ministers assembled in Paris and the ministerial meeting under my chairmanship lasted two days. Sir Oliver Franks, who acted as chairman of the Committee in my absence at the first meeting from. July to september, 1947, took the chair at meetings of the Ministers&apos; Alternates bothduring the two days when the Foreign Ministers were present and at furthersessions on 17th and 18th March after the Ministers had left Paris.4. The agenda of the meeting, although not ldng, was of great importance.Nevertheless the speed with which the Conference reached agreement upon the items to be discussed was most encouraging. At its first session on 15th march the Committee agreed to remit a study of the items on the agenda to the Committeeof Alternates, which met later the same evening and again on the following morning; They quickly reached agreement upon the final draft of a report onthe progress of European Economic Co-operation; this report was transmitted bythem to the Plenary Meeting for adoption and transmission to the United StatesGovernment by myself as Chairman. The second Plenary Meeting adopted thereport without discussion.5. The Alternates further considered the comments of the Technical Cdm-mittees which had been studying the United States Commodity Reports on food and agriculture, fuel and power, iron and steel, inland and maritime transport and timber. These reports were introduced by the Chairmen of the respectivetechnical committees. In the absence of the Chairman of the Technical Committeeon Food and Agriculture, the comments were introduced by M. Bbernia (Holland).After a brief discussion in the Committee of Alternates they were forwarded to
the Plenary Meeting with a suggestion that the Plenary Meeting should take note of the comments by the Technical Committees, and should instruct theSecretary-General to make these comments available to the participating countries and to the United States Government. At the Plenary Meeting brief commentswere made by M. Tsaldaris, Foreign Minister of Greece, and M. Sadak, ForeignMinister of Turkey, otherwise the comments were not discussed and the plenary meeting adopted the recommendation of the Committee of Alternates.6. The Plenary Meeting further adopted a resolution on the participation of the Cbmbined United States-United Kingdom Zone and the French Zone ofGermany in the Continuing Organisation and in the Working Party set up to study the establishment oif a Continuing Organisation (Annex A). In theCommittee of Alternates some slight difficulty had been caused by the fact thatthe two Western areas of Germany would have two votes so long as the french zone was hot fused with the Combined United States-United Kingdom Zone. this difficulty had however been overcome by agreement that in principle decisionsof the Continuing Organisations should not be made by voting but by a mutual agreement. Finally, the Plenary Meeting adopted the terms of reference of theWorking Party which is to study the establishment of the Continuing Organisa-tion (Annex B).7.. The Alternates met on 17th and 18th March after the Foreign ministers had left Paris to consider additional instructions to the Working Party withinthe framework of the terms of reference adopted by the Plenary Meeting. TheCommittee agreed on a directive setting out in outline the purposes, aim and structure of the Continuing Organisation, and calling upon the Working Partytb prepare a draft Multilateral Agreement on the basis of the Paris pledges(Annex C). The Plenary Meeting agreed that the progress report oh european economic Co-operatibh, the Resolution on Germany, and the terms of reference of the Working Party should be made available to the Press. The working party meetings are to be held in private and a further decision on publicitywill be made at the next meeting of the Committee of European economic co-operation.ANNEX AResolution of Germany.
