B.Foreign Office, S. W. 1,29th April, 1948.SOCIAL LEGISLATION IN FRANCEDespatch (No. 259) dated 20th April, 1948, from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Paris (Sir Oliver Harvey) to the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs have the honour to submit the following brief report which aims atsummarising some recent achievements of French Governments in social legisla-tion. It may not be generally appreciated in Great Britain what progress theFrench have made in this field.(a) Social security the Beveridge plan aroused great interest in France as in many othercountries, and immediately after liberation the French went ahead with a similarscheme, involving health, pensions and death benefits, which came into operation on 1st January, 1947. National, regional and local management boards, on whichelected representatives of workpeople have a majority, are vested with considerableexecutive powers. Workmen&apos;s compensation was also brought into the Scheme.In their effect the British and French schemes are much the same, the Frenchhaving a simpler system of payment of contributions and assessment of benefits.Social Security in France moreover does not cost the Exchequer a single centime :the total cost is met by a percentage levy on wages.Family allowances, of course, have been in operation in France for a genera-tion and their present rates, under which, for example, a man with three childrenreceives as much as  12 per month at the current rate of exchange, put themahead of all other countries. Our own 5s. per week (minus income tax) strikesthe average Frenchman as a pleasant little joke. Substantial maternity grants which in all may amount to about  60 for the first child of a mother under25 years, beside bringing financial aid, encourage French women to seek propermedical treatment at time of pregnancy.Not content with introducing a concrete scheme within their own borders,the French authorities have shown great breadth of vision and have alreadyconcluded reciprocity agreements with neighbouring countries.35299
(b) Factory legislation and workers&apos; participation in industry the 40-hour week and holidays with pay have had statutory backing since1936. Since liberation substantial improvements have been introduced in holidaylegislation, especially for young people, who are now entitled to four weeks paidholiday while under 18 and to three between 18 and 21. As part of the policyof directed economy wages are fixed by the Minister of Labour (admittedly anemergency measure) according to a logical and orderly scheme, which endeavours to assess the value of skill and preserve parities between occupations in different industries. A national minimum wage which is raised periodically to meetthe rising cost of living assures that at any rate the bare necessities of life are provided for.The administration is equally concerned with welfare within the factory.Every industrial and commercial undertaking is compelled to have a factorymedical service, a qualified doctor being employed for a prescribed number of hours according to the size of the establishment. Workers of all ages are examinedon engagement and at regular intervals thereafter. There is also a factory welfareservice to help the workers in their day-to-day problems and professional training and diplomas in this field have been instituted by the Ministry of Labour.France has also tackled the problem of workers&apos; participation in management and Works Committees are now obligatory in every firm employing over fiftyworkers. The Committees are elected by the workers and must be consulted onthe general running of the works, on the firms&apos; annual balance sheet, and mayadvise on the disposal of profits. Where the firm is a limited liability companytwo members of the Committee sit on the Board in a consultative capacity. TheCommittees have the actual management of the welfare funds for which a certainpercentage of the firms&apos; turnover is set aside annually, e.g., for the nationalisedelectricity industry, 1 per cent, of gross receipts. The welfare activities areextensive and include factory canteens, co-operatives, where the workers maybuy food and other necessities, holiday camps and sports.Nationalisation of the basic industries, notably mining and gas and electricity,has been accompanied by special Statutes or Charters for the workers, institutingconditions of service that are in all cases an advance on those previously obtainingin France or still in force in the United Kingdom. The Miners&apos; Statute particu-larly is regarded by the National Union of Miners as a model to be followed inGreat Britain.Trade Union organisation in France is more logical and regular than in britain. -Local syndicates are grouped in industrial federations and there isan almost total absence of undignified &quot; demarcation &quot; disputes. Under present law, conditions of employment other than wages are fixed by joint agreementbetween employers and the national union. Having been approved by the Ministryof Labour, the terms then become legally binding on all employers in the industry.(c) General educational and cultural facilities for young peopleNobody would suggest that the standard of French education is inferior toour own. It is, however, to be brought into line with modern needs and develop-ments in the same sense as our own 1944 Education Act. Local authorities do much more to provide holidays for poor children than in Great Britain, and very few towns are without a country estate or seaside camp where children may spendcheap holidays during the summer months. Similarly on leaving school each child has to pass through a vocational guidance centre where, in the light of hisschool record and of modern psychological tests, he is advised on the choice ofa career. Every municipality is obliged to provide and equip a municipal sportsfield and one is struck nowadays by the earnestness with which young peopleundertake sports of all kinds.In other fields the French are not behind us, at any rate in conception. Inthe Roubaix-Tourcoing areas for example a housing fund, supported by a levy on wages, permits workers to own houses which they could not otherwise afford.It is not claimed in this very brief survey that they order these thingsbetter in France but only that they do not neglect them. And, with a live tradeunions movement in action, it is far from correct to say that realisation alwayslags behind conception, even if in some spheres this is true.I have the honour, &amp;c.(Signed) OLIVER HARVEY.British Embassy, Paris,20th April, 1948.
