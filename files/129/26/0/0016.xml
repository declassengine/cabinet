(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL COPY NO. -1 0CP. (h8) 10612th April,  19h8.CABINETCLAIMS FOR WAGES INCREASES BY EMPLOYEES OF LOCALAUTHORITIES AND SOCIALISED industries memorandum by the Minister of Labour and. National service was invited by the Cabinet on 19th-February (CM. (1+8)15th Conclusions, Minute 5) to concert with the other ministers concerned arrangements for obtaining from public bodies,  such as local authorities and boards of socialised industries, immediatereports on all prospective or actual claims for higher remunerationmade by their employees.2. The extent to which Departments are in a position atpresent to obtain information of this kind varies.      I do not feel,and in this I think I will have the support of my colleaguesconcerned, that it would be desirable to make formal enquiries ofthe beards of socialised industries, as a direct approach of thiskind would be contrary to the general policy towards the boards insuch matters which has hitherto been followed by Deportmentsconcerned with socialised industries.      The same considerationapplies in&apos;the case of Local Authorities.3. Arrangements have,  however, been made with the Deportmentsconcerned for them to send any information they may obtain to theMinistry of Labour at the earliest possible date.G.A.I.Ministry of Labour and National Service,S. W. 1 .12th April,  19U,8.
