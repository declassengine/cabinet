(48) 117,3rd May, 1948,CABINET:.1Suoplementary -Injuries Benefits for.__Min.ersMemorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power.1,      The present state of the negotiations between the national coal Board and the National Union of Mineworkers on a scheme to supplement benefits payable to miners incapacitated by injury or industrial disease is set out in my memorandum S.I,(M)   (1+8) 34(attached).      It may be helpful to those of my colleagues who havenot been directly concerned with, the S.I.(n) Committee1s earlierconsideration of this issue to have a brief summary of its history.2.      The Union&apos;s proposals were originally presented to theGovernment in 1946 while the Industrial Injuries Bill was stillbefore Parliament.      Amendment of the Bill to give preferential rates of benefit to minors was, of course, out of the question,but what is now Section 83 of the Industrial Injuries net wasinserted at a late stage on N.U.M.  representations (or so theUnion believes),      It provides for supplementary schemes to beagreed between employers and workers and approved by the Ministerof National Insurance.3.      Substantially the same proposals were presented to the national coal Board as soon as it was constituted in the autumn of 1946.They are set out in the first paragraph of 3.1. (li.) 34.      The Unionurged that a scheme on these linos should be introduced before theAppointed Day under the Industrial Injuries Act  (5th July 1948)*A deputation was received by the Cabinet Puol Committee inFebruary 1947 (P.C.  (47)  7th Meeting) when the Minister of national insurance explained that he sow difficulty about a supplementary scheme being introduced in advance of the general scheme.      TheUnion eventually became reconciled to this view, but Mr. ArthurHorner has stated, publicly that they moan to have a supplement aryscheme by 3th July,      For this reason and because the Board andthe Union were heavily preoccupied with other matters the issue was not pressed seriously until the beginning of this year.4*      At their meeting on 6th February the S,I.  (m) committee approved a supplement ary scheme for miners in principle subjectto a substantial part of the cost being met by contributions fz^omthe workmen, and after a mooting with the Minister of national insurance., I invited the Board on their own responsibility tonegotiate on the basis of a scheme towards the cost of which theminers would contribute 50/b.      The Board agreed to present counterproposals on these linos but at a meeting early last month theUnion made it clear that they were not prepared to discuss ascheme involving any substantial contributions from the workmen(para.  4 of S.  I.   (li)   (43) 34)..5.      The Board have since prepared further proposals which go some way to meet the Union&apos;s demands, but, although under extremepressure to do so have not discussed them with the Union pendingguidance from the Government as to whether their new proposalscontain any element that the Government would not approve.      TheBoard have not,  of course,  offered this explanation of the delay tothe Union.      A meeting is now likely to take place on 7th May andfurther postponement would make it all but impossible for the Board/to

Onthe basis of the Board&apos;s counter proposals it would he over lOd,a ton and if they make the further concessions they have proposedtheyvould still be left with a net saving of about 8d.  a ton.      TheUnion are aware of these facts and while, in an industry wherenormal benefits under the Industrial Injuries Act will he so largelysubsidised at the expense of other industries, there are logicalobjections to any supplementary scheme the cost of which is notborne wholly by the workmen, they will not he readily understood bythe miners in the face of the above figures.7*      The miners argue that they have boon contributing nothing to-wards the cost of payments made under the Workmen&apos;s CompensationActs.      From 5th July, they will have to contribute hd. a week underthe general industrial injuries scheme, and although in many cases,thebenefits given are larger than at present in some cases,  tney are actually smaller.      The total contributions under the Insurance Actwill then be h/lld. a week.     These are additional reasons why theBoard feel that the Union will never agree to a scheme which forcesthcjrn to contribute a further lO^-d. or 1/3d, a week and why they feelthat 2d.  or 3d.   (i.e,  about 50% of the hd.  they will pay under theIndustrial Injuries Act) is the most the minors will agree tocontribute./S.to reach agreement with the -Union and jointly submit a scheme forapproval by the Minister of National Insurance in time for it tocome into operation on 5th July,      Further postponement involves a real risk of a public statement by the Union blaming the Governmentfor the delay.      It is for these reasons that the issue comes tothe Cabinet for decision as one of urgency and importance,6,      The effect on production costs of the Industrial Injuries Actitself and of the various proposals in regard to a supplementary scheme may be broadly summarised as follows:-
IB-   3   -8.     The arguments which will&apos; he used by the Union as regardssavings to the Board and the amount of contribution, if any, whichthe miners should be called upon &quot;to pay, though illogical, will bemade to sound eminently reasonable.      Further, the issue is highlycharged with emotion and one on which the Union will fight withunanimity and determination,      i can only repeat the view expressedin the last paragraph of my paper to the S,  I,   (M) Committee thatit would be wrong to prevent the Board from taking the line they propose unless the Government is -prepared to tell the Union that asubstantial contribution from the workmen is essential and to standon that principle in the face of the determined and public attack which the Union will make on it,II, G,Ministry of Fuel and7 Millbank, S, W,  1,Power,

NO.I.I.(M)(h8) 3k1gp-Hh April, 19k&amp;&apos; CABINETCOMMITTEE OH THE SOCIALISATION OF INDUSTRIESSUPPLEMENTARY INJURIES.....BJiNlOFITS^ FOR MINERSMemcy?nnc].um1.      The main proposals pat to the National Coal Board some time agoby the National Union of Miaeworhers were:(a) that the basic benefits under the Industrial Injuries Actfor injury and disablement (i.e,  excluding allowances fordependants, unemployability and. the need for constantattendance) should be supplemented by 50% and that an extra 20/- a week should be paid to widows;(b) that receipt of benefits under the Act should confer an automatic right to the proposed supplementary payments;(c) that if the Act benefits were not provided for &quot;old&quot;workmen&apos;s compensation cases outstanding at the appointed day separate and adequate supplementary payments shouldbe made to them;(d) that the full cost should be met by the Board,The Government Actuary estimated that a scheme on these lines wouldrequire an annual provision of  6 million equivalent to a weekly contribution of about 3/hd4  per worker.2.      In accordance with the conclusion reached by the Committee at their meeting on 6th February (S.I.(M)  (h8) 3rd Meeting, Minute 6(2)). Iadvised the Board that a scheme which did not provide for something likehalf &apos;the cost to be met from contributions by the workmen &quot;was unlikely to be approved by the Government, and invited the Board, on their own, responsibility and without involving the Government,  to endeavour toreach agreement with the Union on a revised contributory scheme.3.      The Board agreed to proceed on those lines and bearing in mind that.,if the workmen were to contribute 50% of the cost, it would have to bekept as low as possible, the Board put forward the following counter-proposals to the Union: *-(a) that the scheme should be contributory, the total cost beingshared equally by the Board and the workmen covered;(b) that supplementary benefit should be payable only tt) underground,workers and only in respect of underground accidents andIndustrial diseases which result from work underground;(c) that where the degree of disablement is assessed at 8Cfo-100%the Union&apos;s proposals for a supplement of 20/- per week to a widow and of 50% of the basic injury benefit and of thedisablement pension should be accepted, but that for degrees of disablement assessed at k1%-70% inclusive, the supplementshould be at the rate of 33i% of the disablement pensionwith no supplement where the degree of disablement wasassessed at less than hC%.    It was further proposed that/there
- ft -there should be no supplement during the first twomonths and that the aggregate of the State and supplementary benefits should not exceed four-fifths of the injured man&apos;s pre-accident earnings so longas he was unemployed;(d) that there should be no supplement for &quot;old cases&quot; entitledto workmen&apos;s compensation except in respect of a freshaccident or disease,    and(e) that appropriate deductions should be made to take accountof other benefits received from public funds or wheredamages are payable at common law.The Government Actuary estimated that the cost of these counterproposals could he met by an annual charge of about  2,3 millions,equivalent to a total weekly contrihution of about l/9d.. perunderground worker (to be shared equally between the Board andthe workers).h.      The Board have now informed me that the union attitude totheir offer is one of uncompromising adherence to the substance oftheir original proposals with particular stress that the scheme must notnbe contributory.    The Union made it clear that negotiations could not continue unless the Board were prepared to make asubstantial advance and that failing this they would be forced totake other action and, if necessary, to approach the Government.5.     The Board have considered the possibility of negotiatingfurther on the following lines(a) to maintain the principle of a contributory scheme hutcut the workers&apos; contribution to 3d. per week or possibly 2d;(h) maintain limitation to underground workers and undergroundaccidents;(c) grant the full 50% supplement to all whose degree of disablement is 2+0% or more, hut nothing below this degreeof disablement;(d) dispense with the four-fifths earnings ceiling (whichwould no longer be of any effect under the new IncomeTax conditions);(e) dispense with the two months&apos; waiting period, giving thesupplement for the same period as the statutory benefit under the Act;(f) as to existing cases offer to pay independently of theAct an additional 22/6d.  a week to men totallyincapacitated from work so long as they are receivingfull workmen&apos;s compensation from the Board.The cost of these further concessions would be about  1,2 millions per annum, bringing the total cost of the scheme up to  3.millions per annum, equivalent to about 2/7d.  a week perunderground worker,    The Coal Board cannot be certain that eventhese concessions would be sufficient to secure agreement,6.     An analysis of the cost of the various schemes based onestimated made by the Government Actuary is attached as an Appendix.7.      The Government are necessarily concerned in this matter.    Evenif the proposal was for an ordinary industrial agreement (as/distinct
distinct from a scheme having statutory force under S.83 of theIndustrial Injuries Act) it would probably require my approvalunder S.37 of the Goal Industry Nationalisation Act as a schemeproviding for payment of &quot;pensions, gratuities and other likebenefits.&quot;    The issue is thus essentially different from oneaffecting terms and conditions of employment.    The Government,by withholding approval of the result, can render any negotiations on the issue abortive, but if they propose to do so it would benecessary to give timely warning,    If the Governments view is thata substantial contribution from the miners must remain a sine quanon of their approval, I feel that I must so advise the board in writing.    I do not think that the Board will accept responsibilityfor breaking off negotiations without such an indication in a form which they could disclose to the Union.    The Board believe that a breakdown on this issue for which they were held solely responsibleby the Union would do serious damage to their relations with their employees and that the damage would be irreparable if, as they alsobelieve, the Government will subsequently be driven to make further concessions on direct representations from the National Union of mineworkers.8.     The fundamental.issue which emerges is the Union&apos;s insistence on the whole (or nearly the whole)  cost of any supplementary schemebeing met by the Board.    Such a proposition cannot be justified onany logical grounds.    Indeed no supplementary scheme would be altogether free from objection in an industry whore normal benefits are so largely financed by the contributions of others unless thecost were borne wholly by the workmen.    At the same time I must emphasise that this is an issue on which the miners feel stronglyand on which even those miners&apos;  leaders who are most anxious to avoidembarrassing the Government cannot afford to appear lukewarm.    It is,moreover, one on which public sentiment may well tend, howeverirrationally, to favour the.miners,9.      It is, I think, for these reasons and not because of anydisagreement with the logic of the attitude hitherto taken by theGovernment that the Board feel that this is the worst possible issueon which to fall out with the miners.      If negotiations are broken off at this stage and the matter becomes one between the Governmentand the Union, it will, partly because of the past history of Section83, be pursued with the utmost determination and the Board feel thatthe Government will be driven to make concessions.    They therefore consider that the right course would be for them to make the bestagreement they can with the Union as nearly as possible on the lines set out in paragraph 5 above, provided that it does not contain an element which, on presentation to the Government, would be rejected;and they have asked for any further guidance I can give them on thispoint,10,    There are, I think only two possible -courses for the. Governmentto adopt.    Either we should accept the view of the Board and agreeto their continuing to negotiate on the lines proposed;    or wemust at once make clear to the Union that we cannot approve anything more than the Board have already offered. There are groat and obviousdangers in this latter course.    But if we decide to follow it, wemust do so to the bitter end.     Nothing would be more fatal than for the Government to give way on a matter on which we refusedto allow the Board to make any concession.H.G.Ministry of Fuel and Power,7, Millbank,S.W.I.
