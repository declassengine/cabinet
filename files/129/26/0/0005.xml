ANNEX.Total fees incurred &quot;by claimant1 . The contribution proposed in 0.?. (&apos;..,-8) 32 does not represent the whole of the professional fees incurred &quot;by theclaimant.      It will be a percentage,  on the recognisedprofessional scale,  of the ascertained development value -that is,  the difference between restricted and unrestrictedvalue.      In the light of the professional practice in war damage cases,  however, the surveyor might well charge theclaimant the scale fee on the higher of the two valuationswhich he has to make,  i. e.  on the unrestricted value.      On this basis,  though the proportion of development value tounrest looted value will of course vary very widely,  the contribution would on the average be well, below the costsactually incurred - perhaps by mere than 50/0.      In addition the claimant will often incur legal costs towards which therewill be no contribution save in very exceptional cases.Effect if no contribution is made2. The proposed, contribution Is conditional on thecompletion of an optional part Of the claim form on which thedevelopment value ie estimated.      If no contribution is paid,an expert estimate of development value could not &quot;be asked, forcompulsorily.      The result would, certainly be an enormousincrease both in the work falling on the Valuation Office andin the number of arbitrations.      Not only would this slow upthe process of assessing development values,   probably making itImpossible to adhere to the statutory time-table, but theresult might well be more expensive in the long run, sincecosts would be awarded at the discretion of the arbitratorand might well be on the basis of the unrestricted, value,  oreven on the basis of both the valuations which the valuer hast o m a ke.Precedents3* The payment by the State of professional costs incurred by ind.ivie.actuals as a result of compulsory action takenby the State would by no means set a new precedent.      On thecontrary it is already well-established usage.      reimbursement of proper professional costs is the rule in all the followingcases:-(i)    compulsory acquisition of land under any statute;(ii)    requisitioning of land,  chattels etc;(iii)    restriction or compulsory acquisition under theRestriction of Ribbon Development Act,  1935;(iv)    acquisition of coal royalties under the Goal Act,1933.h. In some of those cases the payment is statutory,in others non-statutory. In all cases it covers surveyors&apos;or valuers&apos; fees, in some conveyancing fees.also. The onlymejor case where such a payment has not been made is that ofwar damage value payments. In that case only a simple valuationwas involved., and it was not necessary for the claimant, in theinterests either of himself or of the State, to give his ownestimate in the-first instance.
5- In essence what we are here dealing with is the compulsory acquisition of development values,&quot;&apos; end it seems onlyreasonable that, we should adopt something like the practice whichprevails in compulsory acquisition of land generally.      The case is if anything strengthened by the fact that we ore paying notfull compensation but o share of an arbitrary global sum.Alternative Suggestions6. We have carefully considered, the two suggestions modein the cabinet discussion.      The first was the establishment ofsome Government organisation of valuers paid by salary, whoseassistance would be made available without charge to ownersclaiming loss of development value.      The difficulty here is thatthe valuers&apos;   profession is very sherthanded,  and the GovernmentValuation Service already has great difficulty in recruiting enoughstaff of the requisite standard.      It would be very difficult toodd to that staff o sufficient number of persons to serve ownerswho are being deprived of development value,  and to be available in aid  parts of the country.      The organisation of such a salariedservice,   so as to ensure that its members were steadily andconstantly employed on this particular -ask,  would, moreover, bea formidable if not impossible undertaking.The second suggestion was thus the Government might forma panel of approved valuers for this purpose and. prescribe . the fees which they could properly charge for this work.      Thissuggestion would involve us in the invidious task of picking out,from an unorganised profession,  those  persons whose qualificationscould be regarded as having Government approval.      It wouldcertainly lead to a very serious wrangle vvith the profession, andwould dissipate the present fund of goodwill on which we hope to rely in starting the new arrangements.      It is certainly desirablethat, the profession&apos; should be better organised, with a view to the elimination of insufficiently qualified persons.      But this, i suggest,  would net be the right way te set about it.Discouragement of touting7. I have always appreciated tee danger that the paymentof a Government contribution towards professional fees might encourage the emergence of unqualified persons touting for custom.The scheme proposed in CP. (1+3) 82 io limited to cases where aperson professionally experienced in the valuation of land hasbeen employed;  and requires the adviser to declare himself on theclaim form to be sd-jb a  person.      This doubtless is not a completesafeguard,  but the- Central Lend Board are proposing,  in theirExplanatory Leaflet accompanying the claim form, to include a warning: to owners against the employment of  persons who solicittheir custom,   pointing out that such solicitation is against theetiquette of the&apos; profession.      Further they are reserving the powerto withhold the contribution when they are not satisfied that theadviser is properly qualified.      I have also had it in mind,  assoon as a scheme is announced,  to see the President of the RoyalInstitution of Chartered Surveyors in company with the Chairmanof the Central Land Board,  and encourage him with on offer ofGovernment help,  if necessary,  to take steps to clean up andorganise the profession.
Basis of the contribution8. It is true that a contribution based on development value means that the aggregate contribution is based on thetotal of all development values including &quot;float&quot;.      But thealternative of basing the contribution on the payment actuallymode from the  300 millions would involve delaying the contribution for 5 years.      This would defeat the main objectof the scheme, and would moreover be very inequitable.      Theclaimant with a largo &quot;float&quot; knows he will get only a smallpayment;    but he is compelled to put in a claim for the full amount and thus to incur large professional costs.      He is,if anything,  a harder cose in this respect than the claimantwith a smaller claim or with little &quot;float&quot; who will get ahigher proportional payment from the  300 millions.
