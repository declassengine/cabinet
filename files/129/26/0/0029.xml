7(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(h8)  119 COPY NO.  .?p5TH MAY. 19d-8CABINETCOAL/OIL CONVERSIONMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer at their meeting on 3rd May (P.C.(h8)  9th Meeting,Minute h)  the Production Committee invited me to circulate a paper to the Cabinet on the question of future policjr inregard to coal/oil conversion. J&apos;2. The coal/oil conversion programme was started in the spring of 19h-6, at a time when our coal stocks were shrinkingand when there seemed to be ample supplies of fuel oil forthe sterling area.    By June, 19h7, however, the oil supply position had radically changed,  and it was necessary to announce that no further conversion schemes would beauthorised.    In December, 19h7, a further announcement wasmade that the operation of outstanding schemes would have tobe suspended..   No announcement has been made&apos; since that date,and it is essential that the Minister of Fuel and Power should now give some guidance to the firms concerned with thesesu s p e nde d s c heme s .3* These schemes would require about 2-g million tons of fuel oil in a full year;    in the current year they would increase our total fuel oil requirements from 3*3 million tons to nearly 6*3 million tons.h. The deficit on British controlled supplies of fuel oil in 19h-S   is likely to be about 1-g- million tons,  after taking into account commitments to other countries but without allowing for losses in output from the Haifa refineries.A decision, therefore,  to bring all the suspended conversionschemes into operation might involve expenditure of nearly$30 millions in 19h8.   Although such expenditure might releasemore coal for export, it is not certain that it would be&apos;possible to obtain a compensating return in hard currencies.Moreover,  the United States authorities would undoubtedly be critical of any decision involving an increase in consumptionof fuel oil, since the Economic Co-operation Act instructsthe Administrator to take account of the possibility of usingother-fuels than oil wherever possible.5. No substantial improvement in the supply positioncan be expected for some years, and it is arguable, therefore,that we should not only stop the coal/oil conversion programmebut,  except in special cases, put pressure on firms to returnto the use of coal.    In view, however, of the assurance givenin the House of Commons in June, 19h7* by the then Minister of fuel and Power that oil would be found for all the schemesthat had been authorised, such a reversal of policy vwould be
regarded Toy industrialists as a breach of faith3    it wouldbe politically damaging and it would lead to extensive claims on the Exchequer for compensation.   Moreover,  the fact thatthe fuel oil production of British companies is greatly inexcess of the needs of the United Kingdom and the sterling area would make it difficult to give a convincing publicexplanation of the grounds for the decision,6. For these reasons it is necessary to move carefully.An immediate saving of 0.33 million tons in the current yearand O.85 million tons in a full year can be secured byabandoning the conversion programme initiated by the. RailwayCompanies in 19I4.6.   As regards the other schemes held insuspense,  the Production Committee endorsed a recommendation by the Minister of Fuel and Power that schemes of exceptionaleconomic value (e.g. in steel, and in certain pottery andgdoss production), where considerable expenditure had alreadybeen incurred on conversion,  should be allowed to comegradually into operation.    Such schemes would require100,000 tons of oil this year and 3i4.O7.OOO tons in a full year.For the rest,  it is suggested that the Minister of Fuel and power should take the line that the uncertain prospects of our oil supplies, which have been further complicated by the interruption of the output from Haifa, must necessarily involve further delay, maybe very considerable delay, before theoperation of such conversion schemes could be contemplated,and that in the meantime the firms concerned must continue touse coal.7* If an announcement is made on the lines suggested,we must expect to receive claims for compensation for expenditure already incurred on schemes which must still beheld in suspense.    I consider that any such claims should be firmly resisted.    Compensation has never been paid from theExchequer in respect of claims of this type, and any concession in this instance would open the door to a wide variety of similar applications.    In this respect, however,the Railways ore in o special position.   An extensive con-version scheme was approved by the Ministry of Transport inAugust, 1946, at a time when the Ministry was exercising full control over the Railways, and the Companies were instructedto proceed, with it urgently.    This scheme,  on which, nearly 3 millions has been spent, is now approaching completion.The British Transport Commission are hot prepared to accept any financial responsibility for it, and in the specialcircumstances it is clear that the Government must bear thecost.   No publicity should be given to this arrangement,  thoughit would not be d.ifficult to explain the reasons which justifyaccording- special treatment to the Railways in this matter.The Production Committee invited the Minister of Transport,the Minister of Supply and the Minister of Fuel and Powerto prepare a report on the question of the disposal of the plant and equipment acquired by the Railways for this c o nv e r 3 i o n s c heme.8. The Cabinet are, therefore, asked to agree;-(i)    That coal/oil conversion schemes of exceptionaleconomic value, where considerable expenditurehod already been incurred,  should be allowed tocome gradually into operation.-2-
(ii)    That the Minister of Fuel and Power should announce that, in view of the oil supplysituationy  other- schemes may have to remainin suspense for a considerable time.(iii)    That the Railway conversion scheme should be abandoned^,  and that its cost should beborne by the GovernmentsR a s &quot; 0 oTreasury 0hamber s, s *W o 1 ;*? .5th May, 1948.
