HIS   DOCUMENT IS  THE  PROPERTY  OF HIS   BRITANNIC   MAJESTY&apos;S   GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   March 1948CONFIDENTIAL Copy No.      30CP. (48) 94IWi March, 1948CABINETFILM AGREEMENTNote by the President of the Board of TradeI circulate herewith for the information of my colleagues the text of theagreement reached on 11th March with the representatives of the Americanhim industry.2. The text is not yet in its final form in particular, Mr. Johnston is now working out with the American film interests the mechanical arrangements thatwill be required to operate the agreement, and it is probable that these willrequire certain minor alterations of or additions to the present text.3. It is also possible that as a result of those discussions certain amendmentsmay be made to the schedules which specify the uses to which the companiesmay put their unremitted earnings. For this reason I am not circulating the text of the schedules, but I think my colleagues should know that they areheaded by an enunciation of the following principles which are recognised asfundamental to the agreement as a whole : (a) That the expenditure of the sterling balances should not create anyexcessive additional pressure upon the foreign exchange resources ofthe United Kingdom and the Sterling Area.(b) That the expenditures for any of the purposes in Schedule A shall notbe such as to go beyond the limits of fair competition or be otherwiseharmful to the legitimate interests of the British film industry.(c) That the disposal or use of any Sterling balances not expended inaccordance with Schedule A shall be for purposes which would notdamage the productive economy of the United Kingdom or sterling area.H. W.Board of Trade, S.W. 1,19th March, 1948.annex memorandum of Agreement9(Note : This text is not yet definitive)London, 11th March, 19481.   The United Kingdom Government undertakes to remove the import duty at some convenient date in April and the normal exportation of Americanfilms will be resumed thereafter.2. &quot; American film revenues &quot; are the sterling revenues accruing to UnitedStates interests from the showing of films in the United Kingdom or Eire and&quot; British film revenues &quot; are the dollar revenues accruing to British interestsfrom the showing of films in the United States, its territories and possessionsand the Philippines.35092

During each of the two twelve-month periods following 14th June, 1948,the Treasury will afford facilities for remittance in dollars, at the official rateof exchange ruling at the date of remittance, of such amounts of Americanfilm revenues as will enable the following payments to be made : (a) $17 million per annum payable as a fixed amount in equal monthly instalments.(b) A sum in dollars equal to the British film revenues as defined above,computed and payable quarterly.5. American film revenues accruing during the two-year period referred toabove, not disposed of under paragraph 4 hereof, will be dealt with as follows :  (a) (i) Schedules of permitted uses, subject to agreed principles are attached here to. Schedule A encompasses uses within the film industry inthe Sterling Area without limit as to amount; Schedule B encompassesuses outside the film industry within the United Kingdom and is limited to  2,500,000 sterling during the first two years of theagreement; Schedule C encompasses permitted temporary investments,not constituting a permanent use or disposal of the funds.(ii) A Control Committee will be set up, representative of His Majesty&apos;sGovernment and the American motion picture industry, to pass uponapplications made under the foregoing and upon questions of inter-pretation of the Schedules.(iii) In addition to the uses specified in the Schedules, the owners of american film revenues are entitled to apply at any time to the control committee to use such revenues for other purposes and, if approved,the revenues may be used for such additional purposes.(b) The balance of American film revenues, if any, subject to provision forthe completion of transactions already entered into, will constitute the unexpended residue and shall be dealt with as provided below.6. It is contemplated that the agreement shall last for four years from14th June, 1948, but, before 14th June, 1950, the position will be reviewed withthe object of determining the conditions of the agreement applicable to the secondtwo-year period in so far as not herein specifically provided for.7.

Suchtransactions shall not impose any strain on the United Kingdomforeign exchange position or give rise to any future claim on sterling,and it is contemplated that the transactions may take the form ofcharitable or public uses including encouragement of the arts andsciences.8. If the agreement is not extended beyond 13th June, 1950, then theparties hereto reserve their full freedom of action, provided, however, that theunexpended residue as of 14th June, 1950, may be utilised as set forth in theSchedules during the&apos; two-year period ending 14th June, 1952, except that noexpenditure of such funds shall be permitted for the purchase of foreign distribu-tion rights in British films.
