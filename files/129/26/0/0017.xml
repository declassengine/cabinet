(48) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 2) the cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (48) 84) on the progress of the Trade Conferenceat Havana, then in its closing stages; now that the Conference is over, I am circulating, for the information of my colleagues, a memorandum (Annex B)summarising the more important points which were discussed.2. In accordance with the Cabinefs conclusions the United kingdom delegate at Havana signed on 24th March the Final Act of the Conferenceauthenticating the text of the Charter adopted by the Conference, and in his finalspeech at the Plenary Session (an extract from which is reproduced as Annex A)spoke on the lines decided by the Cabinet on 15th March.3. I have arranged for the text of the Charter to be laid before Parliamenttogether with a separate paper relating to the modifications in the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade mentioned in Annex 11 to my paper CP.

W.Board of Trade, S.W.1,V&amp;th April, 1948.ANNEX AExtract from Final Speech by United Kingdom Representative,23rd March, 1948The Government believe that the Charter as now drawn goes too far inthe relaxation of control over quantitative restrictions for developmental purposes and that closer control would in the end have helped, and not hindered, thecountries at whose insistence these provisions have been redrafted. But still less satisfactory to the Government of the United Kingdom is the final form of thearticle providing for new preferences. We believe the contribution we have made towards general agreement and in fulfilment of the original Proposals from whichthis Charter sprang, by way of limiting and providing for the reduction and eventhe elimination of preferences we enjoy, to be a very considerable contribution. Yetat the same time as we are to accept these provisions we have been asked to acceptanother provision opening up the prospect of a new range of preferences in theinterests of economic development on the accidental basis of geography. Inaccordance with the footnote to the article, however, the Organisation is not bound by a narrow interpretation of region in its study of new preferences which con-form to the purposes and the terms of the article, provided a sufficient degree ofeconomic integration exists between the countries concerned. I am now in aposition formally to withdraw my reservation on this article. But I must make35238 bCONFIDENTIALCP. (48) 10719** April, 1948
it clear that the Government of the United Kingdom will look to the organisation to interpret the article, with the footnote forming part of it, as authorityequitably to consider such proposals as might be put forward for new preferencesbetween particular component territories of our own economic group. They willexpect such proposals to be considered on the same basis as proposals covered bythe article for preferences with the same end in view between other countries.This they regard as the object of the footnote. They will feel it necessary to watch the administration of this article very carefully so that there is no unfairnessbetween the treatment of the British Commonwealth and that of other economicgroups.I must also refer to the article dealing with exceptions to the rule of non-discrimination. This has provided one of the most difficult and complicatedproblems of the Conference. The matter is one of vital concern to countries likeour own, whose economies have been subjected to such violent strains in the achievement of common victory in a long and terrible war. For some years to come,such countries will require latitude to depart from the strict rule of non-dis-crimination. This in a certain measure is provided by the article in question. TheUnited Kingdom, in common, we believe, with many other countries, will need tomake full use of this latitude in the efforts which, at the cost of great sacrificesto her people, she is now making to secure another victory and to bring nearer thecommon aims behind the Charter of restoring convertibility and full multilateral trade. Without the United Kingdom, one of the world&apos;s greatest markets and oneof the world&apos;s greatest exporters, these aims could not be achieved. This articleis designed to meet the immediate position; we shall have to take full advantageof its provisions.I have emphasised the fact that signature of the Final Act of this Conferenceon behalf of the United Kingdom is a decision not taken lightly by the Governmentof my country; it is a decision the importance of which will not I hope, be lost onthe other countries here represented. But, while it signifies that my government intend to recommend this Charter in due course to the Parliament of the UnitedKingdom, their ability to do so when the time comes will necessarily depend uponcircumstances not fully within their own control. These will include in particular the general balance of payments position in which the United Kingdom then findsherself and also finds other countries upon which her economy largely depends and whose economies depend largely upon her own.ANNEX BSummary Report on the Havana Trade conference the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment met at Havanafrom 21st November, 1947, to 24th March, 1948. Its object was to settle theterms of the Charter of an International Trade Organisation on the basis ofthe draft prepared last year at Geneva (published in this country as Cmd. 7212).Fixty-six countries were represented by Delegates at the Havana Conferenceand two other countries sent observers; that is, all the countries of any importancein world trade were present except the U.S.S.R. and its satellites Roumania,Hungary, Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, and Spain (which is excluded by a resolution of the General Assembly from all United Nations conferences).2. The general historical background of the Conference and the main problems which it threw up have already been described in CP. (48) 84, on which ministers decided to authorise the United Kingdom Delegate to sign the FinalAct subject to certain conditions. The Conference resulted in the signatureon 24th March last by all the countries attending the Conference, excejpt Argentinaand Poland, of a Final Act authenticating the text of the Charter. There is asummary in the latest issue of the Board of Trade Journal of the provisions ofthe Charter as it emerged; the following paragraphs of this note deal withcertain points of particular importance.Chapter II. Employment and Economic ActivityProvision is now included for safeguards against external pressure of aninflationary as well as of a deflationary kind. The provisions as to fair labour standards have been somewhat elaborated.
Chapter iii the controversial parts of this Chapter are those dealing with the use of quantitative restrictions to protect nascent industries (Articles 13 and 14) andnew preferences (Article 15).   As regards (i) Protective Quantitative RestrictionsUnder the Geneva draft, the use of such restrictions would (in general) haverequired the International Trade Organisation^ prior approval in particular cases : at Havana, in response to strong pressure from the delegations of the&apos;&apos; under-developed &apos;&apos; countries, somewhat expanded provision, as compared with the geneva draft, was made for certain &apos;&apos; fixed criteria &quot; ; if satisfied that a particularapplication fulfilled one of these criteria the Organisation would automaticallyapprove it. The new criteria (Article 13 (7)) include ones concerned with &quot; warbaby &apos;&apos; industries and with certain industries processing indigenous raw materials,but those criteria which can be said to be truly &quot; automatic &quot; are comparativelynarrow in scope, while the rest involve a considerable measure of judgment bythe Organisation. Further, approval on the basis of these criteria can be givenfor an application only in respect of any one protective measure; such approvalis to be for a limited time only. A provision is added which would enable injuredMembers to obtain compensation. While therefore the Geneva text has been modified in favour of underdeveloped countries, it seems unlikely that any very seriously increased risk to United Kingdom exports is involved. It should alsobe remembered that, without the concessions made to their point of view, manyunderdeveloped countries would have stayed out of the Charter and would thus have been left uncontrolled to their own devices. The threat to United kingdom interests therefore turns out to be less than was feared when CP. (48) 84 was prepared.One change which is directly to our advantage was to confine to import (asagainst export) restrictions the provisions for the use of protective measures for development purposes.(ii) New PreferencesFrom the early stages of preparatory work on the Charter, the &quot; under-developed &apos;&apos; countries pressed strongly to be allowed to establish new preferenceswith their neighbours so as to provide adequate markets for new industries (a rightwhich has often received legal recognition in the past in our own and othercountries&apos; commercial treaties in favour of certain regional groups, thoughpractical use has seldom been made of this right). In the Geneva draft Charteran attempt was made to meet this demand by providing that new preferences for development purposes could be sanctioned by the International Trade Organisa-tion. At Havana, however, it became clear that the underdeveloped countries would accept such a provision only on terms which would render permission for new preferences too easy to obtain.At the same time, existing preferences, such as those of the Commonwealth,came under strong attack, on the ground that they had been given a privileged position. The United Kingdom Delegation rebutted such suggestions, and made it clear that public opinion in this country, which had accepted the rule of no new or increased Commonwealth preferences and an undertaking to negotiate for theirreduction and elimination, would not tolerate undue freedom for others to establishnew preferences. The pressure, however, continued, and was eventually met bythe inclusion, alongside the provision for prior approval by the international trade Organisation, of certain &quot; automatic criteria.&quot; These criteria (all ofwhich must normally be fulfilled) require that under any new scheme the pre-f erences on both sides must be necessary to implement definite development schemes,that the margins of preference shall be subject to the Organisation^ approval, thatthere shall be compensation for injured third parties, that the duration of theschemes shall be limited, and their renewal subject to the Organisation^ approval,and also that the parties must be contiguous or belong to the same &apos;&apos; economic-region.&quot; The United Kingdom Delegation attempted to have this last objectionablecondition extended to cover the Commonwealth or at any rate the United Kingdomand Colonies; they met with no support, however, from the Commonwealth delega-tions and with strong opposition from the United States and other foreign delega-tions. The best that could be secured was a note in the Charter (with fully authori-tative effect), that the Organisation need not interpret &quot;economic region&quot; as35238 b 2
requiring close geographical proximity, if a sufficient degree of economic integra-tion exists between the countries concerned. At the final Plenary Meeting theUnited Kingdom delegates stated, in accordance with Ministers&apos; instructions, thatit would be for the Organisation to treat proposals for new preferences within theCommonwealth on the same basis as other proposals covered by the Article, andthat His Majesty&apos;s Government accepted the terms with reluctance and wouldwatch closely to ensure that there was in practice no discrimination against theCommonwealth in this matter. Actually there is reason to believe that only a fewminor foreign groups will be able to fulfil the &quot;automatic criteria.&quot; TheOrganisation can give its prior approval to other schemes without any regionallimitation, and further, &quot;free trade areas&quot; can be formed under Article 44without such limitation. It was clear that this solution was the best that could beobtained in the circumstances.Chapter IV. Commercial PolicyUnited Kingdom interests under this Chapter were successfully maintained,particularly as regards import restrictions in connection with internal controlschemes for agriculture and fisheries (in spite of considerable opposition to anarticle so specially designed to meet the position of agriculture in industriallydeveloped countries, notably the United Kingdom). On export subsidies for primary products, some concessions had to be made to the United States, butreasonably adequate safeguards remain, and our right to use agricultural sub-subsidies is fully preserved.In the &quot;Technical Articles,&quot; relating to Customs administration and procedure, the changes made were unimportant and call for very little change inUnited Kingdom law and practice, but the provisions should effect useful changesin other countries&apos; law and practice. The most important ones relate to Customsvaluation (on which concessions have been secured in the United States law and practice which should assist our exports to that country) and to dumping; thepractice of dumping is condemned, but the forms of permissible anti-dumpingaction are regulated to prevent misuse.The chief point of difficulty in this Chapter was the provision permittingdiscrimination under balance-of-payments restrictions.  The Geneva text (Article23) permitted countries to discriminate in order to obtain imports additional to those they could purchase non-discriminatorily.  This was subject to conditions,notably (a) that, after 1st March, 1952, the facility would only be available in times of &quot;substantial and widespread&quot; international disequilibrium and only with annual prior I.T.O. approval; (b) that additional imports should not betaken as part of a bilateral arrangement which resulted in reducing the convertiblecurrency earnings accruing from the exports of the discriminating country.   TheGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade included an Article containing non-discrimination provisions identical with those of the Geneva Draft Charter,together with an additional paragraph suspending the  non-discriminationobligation entirely until the end of 1948, with power for the Organisation to suspend it for further periods for individual Members in case of need.   ThisGeneva General Agreement text encountered two main difficulties at Havana.First, the United States Delegation refused to consider adding the GeneralAgreement paragraph to the Geneva text; secondly, they gave condition (b) above ameaning which would have endangered the whole structure of European (and other)bilateral trade and payments agreements.  A deadlock ensued, in which the UnitedStates Delegation long refused even to negotiate.   Eventually they introduced a new text, based on the original 1945 &quot; Proposals,&quot; designed to give substantialfreedom for discrimination by any Member still permitted to operate under thepost-war transition period arrangements of the International Monetary Fund(which run in general until 1st March, 1952, at earliest but will not necessarilythen   terminate   for   individual   Members).     The   permissible   extent   of discrimination was to be :  (i) the equivalent of discriminations which the member would practise by means of exchange controls under the I.M.F.Agreement, or (ii) the continuation, and adaptation to changing circumstances,of discrimination actually in force on 1st March, 1948.   This text was intendedto provide a very wide latitude for discrimination during the post-war transition period, and was so accepted by the European countries.   On 1st March, however,the United Kingdom was still bound by section 9 of the United Kingdom-UnitedStates Loan Agreement and although the United States Delegation assuredus that the right to &quot;adapt to changing circumstances &quot; would cover us in theevent of a subsequent release from Section 9, doubts were felt in London.
Accordingly, after protracted negotiations in London and Havana, agreement was finally reached on a text providing that the United Kingdom (in common with other original signatories of the General Agreement) may, if it so electsbefore 1st January, 1949, operate, not under the Havana text, but under the geneva text to which has been added an interpretative note to give protection against the dangerous American interpretation referred to above. These twomodes of operation apply only during the I.M.F. post-war transition period ofthe Members concerned. Thereafter, instead of discrimination only beingallowable when disequilibrium is &quot; substantial and widespread,&quot; any countryin balance of payments difficulties may, with I.T.O. approval, discriminate inrespect of &quot; a small part of its trade &quot; which is all we have ever envisaged assuitable for discrimination. A further new provision has been secured permittingcountries to use export discrimination (at any time) to increase hard currencyearnings. The Geneva provisions permitting discrimination (i) in favour of&quot; war-shattered economies &quot; (including the United Kingdom itself) up to the endof 1951, (ii) in each other &apos;s favour by countries such as the United Kingdom-Colonies group which share a common quota in the International monetary fund, and (iii) against countries whose currencies are declared scarce by theFund, have been retained. On balance, this represents a substantial improve-ment on the Gevena draft, giving greater freedom while post-war disequilibriumlasts without spoiling our chances of securing in due course the replacement ofSection 9 of the United States Loan Agreement by the non-discriminationobligations of the Charter.The need for the United Kingdom to take full advantage for some years to come of the latitude to depart from the strict rule of non-discrimination was,again in accordance with Ministers&apos; directions, emphasized by our representative at the final plenary meeting.As regards customs unions, the relevant article (44) has been amended ina way which should enable reasonable arrangements to be negotiated as regardsCommonwealth preferences if the United Kingdom were to decide to enter a western European Union.In Chapters V (Restrictive Business Practices) and VI (Inter-governmentalCommodity Agreements), the United Kingdom desiderata have in general been secured. We have ensured that there will be no inconsistency between the restrictive Practices Chapter and the Monopolies Bill which was concurrentlyin preparation.In Chapter VII dealing with the structure and functions of the international trade Organisation, it was found impossible to secure weighted voting, butsatisfactory provision is made as to the composition of the Executive Board :out of 18 seats on this, 8 are reserved to the countries of chief economic importance,thus securing continuing representation for the United Kingdom, Canada andIndia.Chapter VIII, Settlement of Differences, leaves the Organisation free to judge economic questions, while allowing appeal to the International Courton legal questions.In Chapter IX (General Provisions), the article (98) dealing with relationswith non-Members should not impede the agreements we shall undoubtedly be making with non-Member countries. Under the Territorial Application Article(104), our Delegation were able to secure a provision whereby it will be possiblefor particular Colonies to be excluded from the Charter, if so desired.The position of Switzerland3. Considerable difficulties were experienced in attempting to find a place for Switzerland within the Charter rules owing to the fact that, though notexpecting to be in balance of payments difficulties, she has a system of import control. On the other hand, she would be exposed to real danger if her presentsystem were immediately replaced by the Charter rules. In the end, the matter was left to be further studied by the Interim Commission which is to prepare forthe eventual establishment of the International Trade Organisation and thusSwitzerland was enabled to sign the Final Act.4. Two other bodies met at Havana towards the close of the Conference,namely (1) the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, and (2) the Interim Commission which is to prepare for the establishmentof the International Trade Organisation. The former agreed some modifications of the General Agreement, one of which (the substitution for the Geneva article ondiscrimination under balance of payments restrictions of the Havana version)awaits His Majesty&apos;s Governments approval, while one other (as to the substitu-tion of the Havana version of the Customs Unions Article 44 for the unsatisfactoryGeneva version) requires the deposit of a formal acceptance on His Majesty&apos;governments behalf. The work of the Interim Commission calls for no specialdescription here.5. Full reports on these two subsidiary meetings will be circulated tointerested Departments in the Trade Negotiations (T.N.) series.
