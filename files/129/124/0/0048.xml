RESTRSC i EDOCUMENT ISCPERTY OF HE.OF HER BRITANNIC MAJSSTY&apos;S G..-VERNM.ENT)C(66) 48COPY NO.2nd March, 1966CABINETMINISTRY OF SOCIAL, SECURITY:  DRAFT STATEMENTNote by the Minister of Pensions and National insurance submit for consideration, as invited by the Cabinet on tuesday, 1st March (CC(66) 15th Conclusions, Minute 3) a draft statement on the Plan for the Ministry of Social Security.Ministry of Pensions and National Insurance, Y/. C. 2.1st March, 1966
RESTRICTED371PLAN FOR THE MINISTRY OF SOCIAL SECURITYDRAFT statement with permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to give the House an outline of the Governmentrs proposals for a scheme to replace national assistance and which my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster foreshadowed on 23rd February.A Ministry of Social Security will be established bringing together the existing Departments of the Ministry of Pensions and National insurance and the National Assistance Board.     This reorganisation has three mainaims.     First, the creation of the new Ministry will put an end to the distinction between separate offices for the administration of insurance benefits on the one hand and means-tested benefit on the other.     Second,local administration will be developed to provide a more comprehensive andconvenient service for the public, and a more effective instrument toensure that people who have not so far claimed the help to whichithey areentitled are encouraged to do so.     Third, the co-ordination of policy for all social security benefits will be made easier.A new scheme of non-contributory benefits will replace national assistance, and will provide a form of guaranteed income for the old, \\which will normally be reviewed and renewed once a year.     Assessment ofthe new benefits will continue to be related to different income standardsfor married couples, single householders and other persons, and will allow for rent.     Provision will be made for additional payments to meetspecial individual needs;   but the aim will be to make this part of thescheme more readily understandable than the discretionary additions now made, mainly for the elderly, under present arrangements.Rules for the treatment of resources will be simplified andrationalised.     There will be a small &quot;disregard&quot; of all income exceptNational Insurance pensions and benefits, family allowances andmaintenance payments.     The amount of savings of any kind to be totallydisregarded will be increased, so that modest savings will be ignored - no matter how they are invested.     A new system will be adopted for capitalabove this level.     It will be assessed as income under a graduated tariffand aggregated with other income for the purpose of the income disregard.This will get rid of the.rigid limit of  600 which at present by itselfdisqualifies the holder entirely from benefit.The procedure for claiming the new benefit will be made much more flexible for retired people.     They will have a choice of sending tothe Ministry&apos;s local office a written declaration of their circumstancesor of being visited at home.     If they choose the first, the assessmentbased on the written declaration will need to be confirmed by an interview,but if desired this could take place at the local office.There will be less routine visiting!   but visiting officers willhave more time to ensure that any welfare needs are identified and brought to the notice of the appropriate service.\ i1.
a O 7 oRESTRICTED O (  When an elderly person receiving the new benefit also has anational insurance pension the two will &quot;be paid together on asingle order hook.   Those who are not receiving retirement pension will receive payment on an order &quot;book of similar appearance to the retirement pension order book.   The Government hopes to start apilot programme for the issue of combined books in a selectedRegion soon after the new scheme begins.v.The new Ministry will send to everyone claiming a national,insurance retirement pension details of the new benefit.   arrangements will be introduced as soon as possible to make personal contact with every national insurance pensioner who, on retirement, does notclaim the new benefit, unless he indicates that he does not want it.Similar arrangements will be made to get in touch with married women on widowhood.   As this scheme for personal contact develops, furtherchecks will be introduced by arranging to contact pensioners after,they have been retired for some years.Financial help is not the only kind of help that old people fail to seek.   A wide range of services to meet health and welfare needsis provided by local authorities but recent investigations have shownthat these are too often not known by old people or that the effort to make the necessary contact is beyond them.   The Government intend to ensure that all such people are made fully aware both of the newbenefit and of the other services available.   The contacts madeunder the arrangements I have described will make a valuable contribution to this object.In order to preserve flexibility and responsiveness to human needsthe new benefits will be administered by an independent corporate body.Within the Ministry of Social Security there will be a Commission ofpersons chosen for their interest in, and knowledge of, social problems,in whom will be vested the responsibility, under &quot;broad regulations made by the Minister, for guiding the new scheme and for individualawards.The Government hopes to introduce early legislation on theseproposals.When the changes, which have the support of the present national assistance Board, are complete, the Government believes that they willbe seen to preserve what is good in the present scheme while gettingrid of those features which create dislike or misconception.Everybody recognises the humanity and efficiency with which theNational Assistance scheme is administered and the Government is confident that these qualities will be carried over into the new organisation.   But the new Commission and the staff concerned willbe enabled to do an even better job.   There will no longer be thepresent sharp distinction between benefits related to contributions and non-contributory benefits.   The Government believes that thearrangements I have described will ensure that the elderly will haveno hesitation in claiming a benefit, given with dignity, to whichthey are entitled and which the nation wish them to have.2.
