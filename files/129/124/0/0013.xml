OCUMSNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C(SS) 13 COPY NO.       jj P19th January, 1966CABINETIViemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland at their meeting on 23rd December (C. C. (65) 73rd Conclusions,Minute 3) the Cabinet decided that I should make regulations to increasethe salaries cf Scottish teachers by an average of 13 per cent from 1stApril next and that a reference should be made to the National board for Prices and Incomes on the question whether this increase putScottish teachers into a fair relationship with English teachers and, ifnot, what further adjustment was required to achieve that objective.It was also agreed that the Board should be asked to consider what arrangements should be made to ensure that in future the salaries of english and Scottish teachers came up for review simultaneously, inorder to minimise the risk of ^eap-frcgginr&apos;.2,       Agreement has been reached on the reference to the Board, butthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and I are not agx&quot;eed on the way in whichthe new salary scales for Scottish teachers should be reached on thebasis of the 13 per cent increase on which we decided.3,       The Chancellor wishes me to base the scales on a reduction, bya uniform percentage, cf the recommendations of the Scottish joint council for Teachers&apos; Salaries (the negotiating body), so as to preserve the lead proposed by the Council for three-year trained non-graduateteachers.     The arbitration award on English teachers1 salaries raised the increases at the lowest points on the English basic scale from  80to  100, and the Chancellor considers that, if the scales I propose are adopted, the Prices and Incomes Board would be likely to recommenda corresponding increase for the Scottish lower paid teachers.4.       For many reasons I am clear that my right course is to apply ageneral 13 per cent increase to the existing scales.    Within the overallincrease of 15 per cent which I proposed to the Cabinet to enable me toaccept as a whole the recommendations of the Scottish Joint Council Iwould have been ready to accept a lead for the non-graduate scale inthe context of approving in full an agreed settlement.    But now that Iam limited to an overall 13 per cent increase, it v/ould be quiteunjustifiable to give a lead to the non-graduate scale.     This scale is entirely different from the English basic scale:  the Scottish scale is awomen&apos;s scale (we do not have non-graduate men teachers of generalsubjects in the schools) and there are no arguments whatever onrecruitment grounds for treating the non-graduate women teachers more favourably than graduates and holders of specialist diplomas.     These,and not non-gradua/ee women, are the teachers who are scarcest and whom it is most difficult to recruit.     Given the 13 per cent limit, there is no

(The aimcf the negotiating body in proposing larger proportionate increases forthe non-graduate women was essentially to achieve parity at themaximum with the English basic scale, and since this cannot be denewithin an average 13 per cent increase the case for the higher increaseslapses).     The graduates and specialist diploma holders would objectmost strenuously to the larger proportionate increase which theChancellor wishes me to give to the less well qualified category, andthe difficulties which I am bound in any case to have with the teachersover the salary settlement would be very seriously aggravated.5. I am under immediate pressure to make a statement on salaries and I must therefore ask for a decision now.W.R.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.19th January, 1966
