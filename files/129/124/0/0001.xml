IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 1 COPY NO.10th January, 196666LOCAL. GOVERNMENT FINANCE - ENGLAND AND &quot;V/ALESMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentIn September the Cabinet approved (CC(65) 48th Conclusions,Minute 1) proposals for a new system of financial assistance to localauthorities designed to keep the growth of rates broadly in line with thegrowth of the economy as measured by gross domestic product.     Underthis system an aggregate of Exchequer assistance would be determined for each year on the basis of estimates of expenditure;   some of thiswould be distributed through grants in aid of particular services, andthe remainder through a general grant in support of the rates.i2.       Further work on the proposals, and discussions which have beenheld with representatives of local authorities, suggest that furtherconsideration is needed on four main points.Increase in grants3.       The precise relationship to be established between thegrowth of rates and the growth of gross domestic product (G. D. P. )was not determined;   but the figures upon which C. (65) 126 was based pointed to increases in the aggregate of Exchequerassistance (Great Britain) of the order of  30 million in the first year, 60 million in the second, and so on.    A direct link between growth ofrates and growth of G.D, ?, in fact seems impracticable:   apart from the obvious difficulty of forecasting growth of G.D.P. , we should, on aliteral application of the principle, have to meet the full amount ofany increase in costs due to changes in pay and prices.    Further, thelocal authorities were worried by the uncertainty of what the applicationof the formula would mean in terms of money.40       Officials have therefore considered how best to apply theprinciple in a way easier for the authorities to comprehend, and withoutundermining their financial responsibility and leaving the Exchequerwith completely unlimited liabilities.     We should achieve greatercertainty in the amount of the Exchequer commitment in the next fewyears, and greater certainty for local authorities, if we undertook tomade regular yearly increases over that period in the percentage oflocal governments net expenditure borne by grants.    It appears that anannual increase of one in that percentage would result in grant increases of the right order, and could be justified in a broad way by reference toa comparison between the growth in local government expenditure andgrowth of G.D.P, over recent years.
-2-Application of additional money5.       An increase in grant of the order of  30 million will seem a verysmall beginning in the light of the undertaking in the manifesto to &quot;seek to give early relief to ratepayers by transferring a larger part of theburden of public expenditure from the local authorities to the Exchequer&quot;.It may be considered derisory against a current rate burden of about 1,250 m.   and last year&apos;s increase of nearly  150 m.    It would clearly have been desirable to have made a much more substantial transfer, butbudgetary considerations seemi likely to rule this out.6.       It is the pressure of rates on householders which is the sorepoint of the rating system, and there is in my view a good case for using the v/hole of the extra money for their relief.    As domestic ratepayersbear roughly half the total rates, this would double the advantage tothem.     There are other claims on the extra money;  but I think that wemust devote at least  25 m. to the relief of the householder.    Whileincreases in rates are no doubt equally unpalatable to commerce andindustry, they at least do not have to meet them out of taxed income.7.       The use of the extra money - or of most of it - in this way couldbe reconciled with the general principle of keeping the overall growth in rates in step with, growth in G.D.P.    We should simply be taking theopportunity afforded by the injection of the extra money tc achieve a gradual, and fairly modest, redistribution of shares of the rate burdenin favour of domestic ratepayers.Education grant8.       At the earlier discussion the Cabinet agreed that there should bean education grant of 50 per cent of aggregate expenditure distributed bya formula.    The Secretary of State for Education and Science and Ithink that we must reconsider this.    When the Cabinet last discussed itwe recognised that a 50 per cent grant would appear to be lower than the60 per cent grant previously paid;  but we thought that we could rely on the argument that this did not represent the whole of the Exchequer assistanceto education.    Subsequent discussions with the local authorities have,however, shown that it would be impossible to put this argument oversuccessfully.9.       To retain a separate education grant and increase the amount to60 per cent would require so much money that the education grant wouldhave to take over some of the redistributive functions of the rate-support grant.    We should then have, in effect, two general grants differing inlittle more than title.    By contrast, as the local authorities haveremarked, it is not in fact necessary to have a separate education grant in order to achieve the distribution of money which we desire.10.        The Secretary of State and I are therefore agreed that the better course would be not to have a separate education grant, but to includethe appropriate factors in the distribution formula for the rate-support grant.    It is true that in the hianifestc we said that we would &quot;restore the percentage grant and transfer the larger part of the cost of teachers&apos;salaries from the rates to the Exchequer&quot;;  but our earlier decision had ,already accepted that we would, not pursue that.
Highways - ^11. At present the Ministry of Transport pays grant in aid of theconstruction and major improvement of all classified roads:   about six-sevenths of the grant goes on Class I roads, which are aided at 75per cent.    In addition, grants are paid in respect of the maintenance and minor improvement of classified roads, except in Inner London andthe county boroughs.12.        The proposals discussed with the local authorities envisaged the discontinuance of ail specific grant in respect of maintenance and of theconstruction and improvement of secondary roads;   and the reductionfrom. 75 per cent to 50 per cent of the grant for the construction and improvement of &quot;main roads&quot; (broadly, Class I roads).     The specificgrant so released would go to swell the rate-support grant.13.        The minister of Transport and I have found the local authoritiesbitterly opposed to the reduction in grant for new work on main roads.No conceivable formula for distributing rate-support grant would com-compensate for the resulting substantial local changes in rate burden,especially in London, and we do not think that it would be right to force this change through against the unanimous opposition of the localauthorities concerned.     This need have no effect on the 50 per centlevel proposed for the new capital grants in other services.     There isa vital difference between reducing the level of an existing grant andsustaining  the level proposed for a new grant.14.        The other changes prcjDosed to the highways system remainessential for bringing the highways administration up-to-date.    Inparticular we must limit capital grants to the new &quot;main roads&quot; andtreat street lighting for traffic purposes as a highway function.    Wetherefore seek the agreement of our colleagues to press ahead withthese changes despite the lack of enthusiasm of the local authorities.15.        The local authorities might be persuaded to accept them if theycould be assured that grant was being increased so that county boroughs and Inner London received assistance towards highways maintenance,through the operation of the distribution formula, without it being purelyat the expense of what the county councils could expect to get.    hither to the county boroughs and the L. C,C, have never had assistance towards this expenditure;  but it is agreed that we must now provide for this.A flat increase of about  5 m. would be necessary to ensure that this new provision is not made at the expense of the count1/ councils.    It-would clearly be much more acceptable to the authorities if this were an ad hoc addition to the  30 m. , and I hope that my colleagues will agreethat this should be made.Conclusion16.        I accordingly invite my colleagues:-(1)     to agree to the proposed method of fixing the aggregate of&apos;. Exchequer assistance, and tc increases of the order ot  30 m.in the first year and  60 m. in the second;-3-
(2)    to agree that all cr most of the additional money should beapplied specifically to the relief of domestic rates;education through the rate-support grant instead of through aseparate education grant;(4)    to agree to the inclusion of an additional, flat  5 in. in respectof maintenance of highways in county boroughs and InnerLiOndon;   and to the retention of 75 per cent grant for construc-tion and improvement of main roads, on the understanding thatwe press ahead with the other highway changes.(3)to agree to give Exchequer aid to revenue expenditure onMinistry of Housing and Local Government, S.W.I.10th January, 196;CONFIDENT1AL
