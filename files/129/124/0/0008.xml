CHAPTER   1 :THE   REZSRELTCEThe Grigg Report on Recruiting (Cnnd. 545, published October 1953)covered many aspects of the problem of recruitment and retention of manpower for the Armed Forces.     On pay, it took the view that thecurrent Service rates (effective at April 1958) bore a reasonablerelationship to those outside, and did not deter recruitment.     Itregognised, however, that there was acute concern in the Servicesabout the need to preserve the real value of total emoluments and recommended that there should be an automatic biennial review to take into account movements in civilian earnings over a range of occupationsto be determined between the Treasury and the Service Departments.The Government agreed, in commenting on the Report in November 1953(Cmnd. 570), that Service pay and pensions should be reviewed regularlyat intervals of not more than two years.     The first of the biennialpay reviews, published in Febraary i960 (Cmnd. 945)? described the basis on which changes in Service pay would be determined in future.     for officers they would be governed broadly by relative changes in the pay of comparable grades in the Home Civil Service, (the Executive andAdministrative grades), and for Other Ranks by changes in average earnings and wages in manufacturing and certain other industries asnotified by the Ministry of Labour,     Thus the Grigg system comprisesbiennial reviews based on clearly defined comparisons with pay movementsoutside the Services.The present review is the foiirth in the series and is due to take effect in April 1966.     We were asked by the Government to advise themby 18th January 1966 whether the increases in pay arrived at during the
present rc-vie&apos;w through the apjplication of the Grigs; formula \wereinrelation to total emoluments, consistent with Part 1 of the white paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Grind. 2639); particularly paragraph 15.we were asked to pay special regard to the need of the Services to recruit and retain on a voluntary basis sufficient men to meet the commitments of the Services, and to the special features of Servicelife.     Our terns of reference did not invite us to examine the validity of the Grigg formula,;   we have, however, indicated one importantrespect in which it nay need to be reconsidered in relation to the white paper on Prices and Incomes Policy.The future manpower requirements referred to in this Report are basedon current assumptions about defence policy.- 2 -u
CHAPTER   pay   AITO   ALLOUAITCSS5.     The pay structure of the Armed Forces is designed to produce broadequality of treatment for each Service, while providing for the differences between thorn in character and function.     It canconveniently be described under two heads -        and Allowances.6.     Pay consists ofs-(a) the basic pay for a given rank (including &quot;trade&apos; pay as appropriate).     This varies for Other Ranks according to theperiod of engagement;(b) additional pay for special skills (e.g. flying pay, parachutepay, submarine pay) or for particularly disagreeableconditions (e.g. Hard Lying money).     Additional pay accounts for only aboxit 3 per cent of the &apos;pay&apos; budget;(c) increments (for length of service).7.     Allowances are paid to cover the additional expenses incurred by service personnel in the course of their Service activities, and in lieu of itemsnormally provided in kind.     Only two of these allowances are regarded aspart of the total earnings of individual Service personnel.     These are:-(a) marriage allowance (about half the total Service personnel aremarried);    and(b) ration allowance (paid to anyone not fed in kind).8,     Total emoluments is the sum of the items comprised in pjar^; (includingadditional pay and increments), marriage allowance and ration    allowance.It is in relation to this total that we are asked to consider the increasesproduced by the application of the Grigg formula.- 3 -
At each biennial review the relevant percentage increases produced by theformula are applied to the budget for pay of Officers and Other Hanks at current rates.     The- resultant increase in the pay budget is called the global sun.   This sun is then distributed in the forn of increases in basic pay and increases in additional pay or in certain forns ofadditional pay.     In order to maintain a coherent structure of payscales the basic rates are kept, as far as possible, in the sanerelationship;   flexibility is obtained through changes in additionalpay although those usually take up only a snail proportion of the globalsun.Marriage allowance and ration allowance, although reckoned as part oftotal emoluments, are not taken into account in apportioning the globalsum.     Changes in these allowances are made separately fron the biennialreview..     The marriage allowance vras last changed in snd no revisionis currently proposed;    the ration allowance is adjusted twice a year inlino with changes in the price of some basic foods.The preparations for a biennial pay review start in the autumn of theyear before the next pay award is due.     In assessing the appropriateincrease for Other Ranks, the latest information available at this timeof the year on earnings in manufacturing and other industries relates to the previous July and this is compared with earnings two years before.     In the case of Officers, all known information about movements in salaries of the Executive and Administrative grades of the Civil       . ,Service since the last review is taken into account.     On this occasion,namely, the autumn of 1965? a comparison was made with the movements in earnings in industry bet-ween 1st August 19^3 and 31st July 19651this showed an increase of 18.3 per cent.     The comparison withmovements of salaries in the comparable grades of the Civil Serviceshowed an overage increase of between 18 and 19 per cent.     This lattercomparison includes the incree.se of 3g per cent payable to the non-industrial Civil SerAQ.ce on 1st January 1966, but excludes the increases recommended by the Standing Advisory Committee for the Higher CivilService because they have not yet been implemented.The global sum produced by the current review, expressed as a, percentageof total emoluments (i.e. pay, marriage allowance and ration allowance)represents an incz-ea.se of 12;:- per cent on the previous level.     This isan overall percentage increase and it does not necessarily follow thatall Service personnel will receive the sexie proportionate increases.Much depends on the entitlement of individua.1 Service personnel to particular forms of pay or marriage and ration allowances.
CONFIDENTIALCHAPTER   3. ^ g2THE   CASE   FOR   INCREASED   PAY13.     The increase of 12-g- per cent on total emoluments resulting fromthe application of the Grigg formula would, be effective from 1st April 1966 and, if the biennial review system is continued,be operative for two years.     Within the pattern of regularbiennial reviews an increase in total emoluments over two years in line with the average annual rate of increase laid down in theWhite Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy would be between 6 and per cent.     Thus an increase of 12-?;- per cent over two yea,rs falls to be considered as an exceptional increase within the terms ofparagraph 15 of the White Paper.14.     The concept of productivity cannot be applied in any real sense tothe activities of the Armed Forces.     Our attention has been drawn,however, to the more exacting conditions under which the Armed forces are now operating.     The incidence of overseas commitments in recentyears has amounted, in effect, to running wartime operations underpeacetime conditions of service.     This combined with the manpowershortage dealt with later in this Chapter has meant that thoseactually involved in such operations have been stretched to the full,whilst those not directly involved have had to cover additional commitments.     It was suggested to us that in this way moiaboro of theAiaaod Forcoo oan bo said to havo oontmbutod to the more effectiveemployment of manpower.15.     The Services have sought to make more productive use of their availablemanpower in other ways.   Work study and 0. &amp; M, organisations haveeffected economies in the manpower required for particular tasks and.... improved .   j operational efficiency (for example, in the servicingand inspection of armoured vehicles, in the docking, maintenance saidturn-round of submarines).     Automatic processes have been introduced in storekeeping and accountancy.   Computers have cut down on clericalwork?   modern programme control techniques have been used on a numberof projects.     Civilians have been used wherever appropriate to release
Servicemen for operational duties.     In these and other ways the&apos;tail&apos; element in the Armed Forces has been reduced.So far as operational personnel are concerned, the Royal Air Forcehave increased tho ratio of flying hours to personnel and the royal navy have considerably reduced the ratio of time in harbour to time at sea for certain of their ships.     They claim that they are continuing to look for further opportunities for streamlining their -methods, but that neither this nor more elaborate mechanisation, andautomation can make good the basic shortage of manpower, particularly for conventional military operations.The current recruitment and re-engagement position of the Services is unsatisfactory and appears to be deteriorating.   At about 400*000 menoverall, the Services are down on their target with severe shortages incertain branches.     The overall strength of the Armed Forces has fallenslightly since the ending of National Service, but their commitmentsoverseas have increased.It is estimated that the annual number of recruits required during theInext few years will be of the order of 40,000 - 45?000.     This amountsto 1 in 5 of the young men in the 15 - 19 &amp;ge group who 3,re notdisqualified (e.g, on physical grounds) or lost to higher education.On present recruiting rates, the Services will not reach this target.For 1965 &quot;the recruiting figures for the three Services show a short-fall on their overall target of some 18 per cent.Targets for recruiting are, of course, dependent not only on the target for the total size of the Services but on the extent to which-they achieve their targets for re-engagement.   The Royal Navy aims at65 per cent re-engagement for those on 12 year engagements and 50 percent for those on 9 year engagements.   In 1964 re-engagement stood at52 per cent and 33 per cent respectively; in 1965   it   fell to 48 percent and 24 per cent.   The Army requirement is for a 100 per centre-engagement for technicians and higher skilled tradesmen at the 66.
and 9 year option points^, and 60 per cent and 40 per cent for all others.     The current rate of re-engagement of all personnel at the year option point is about 40 per cent and the evidence suggeststhat at the 9 year option it is unlikely to exceed 35 po- cent,   Inthe Royal Air Force the number of airmen re-engaging in 19^5 &quot;^as only about half the number required.     The failure of the Armed Forces tore-engage as many men as they require both reduces the number of experienced men available and moans that a greater proportion of themmust be used in training replacements.20.     For Officers, the Services are below strength overall, especially as aresult of shortages of graduate and technically qualified entrants.The Service Colleges continue to be filled but they provide only partof the Services&apos; requiixmients (and even here the Services are exper-iencing difficulties, e.g. the Royal Air Force have experienced adecline in recruitment for Cranwell),     The remainder of the Services&apos;requirements is met from Officers on commissions of shorter duration,but there is considerable difficulty in obtaining sufficient numbers,21.     In short, the Services are facing a formidable problem in recruiting and retaining sufficient personnel and, in their view, the problem islikely to grow in the next few years.    It is not suggested thatimprovements in pay alono will solve this problem.   Recruiting patternsover the last few years show little direct connection with pay awardsand individual studies have produced conflicting evidence on theimportance of pay on recruitment and rc-engagement.   Surveys carriedRoyalout by the Army in 1961 and by the/Navy in 19^3 on attitudes amongServicemen to re-engagement did not suggest that pay t;8.s a key factor.On the other hand, a recent analysis by the Royal Air Force of 1,200candidates who had applied to join between April and September 19^5? &quot;but*        Since 19575 initial engagements in the Army are for 22 years withopportunity to terminate the engagement at a number of stages.    The twoearliest of these option points are six and nine years.
who subsequently withdrew their applications, showed that inadequacy of pay was the most important rotison given for withdrawal.   There isalso some evidence from an Army study that the attraction of higherpay does induce men to undertake a longer period of engagement.The main burden of the Services&apos; case is that, whilst recognising thatpay is only one of the factors to be taken into account, the with-holding of a pay increase on the basis of the Grigg system at a timewhen they are carrying out a biennial review would exacerbate thedifficulties of persuading those already serving to re-engage and potential recruits actually to enlist.   In other words,in the present manpower situation and at the present stage in theprogress of tho biennial review, anything less than an award based onGrigg would in all probability make the present position worse.
CHAPTER   4OUR   JUDGEMENT   AND   RECOIfiv-SNDATIONS23.     There arc special features of Service life which taken together set itapart from the normal run of civilian occupations.    Servicemen under-take a whole-time commitment to serve in any part of the world for aslong as their service lasts.   This involves them in training, preparing for and participating in armed operations;   and maintaining efficiencyunder all conditions, operational or otherwise.   It also involvesfrequent movements at home and abroad, with enforced separation fromwife and family, sometimes with little warning.    Servicemen have toaccept a strict code of discipline and are subject to both military and civil law.   They cannot themselves negotiate changes in pay or conditions of employment.24.     Service life also offers many attractive features.   Without them itwould have been impossible to achieve a voluntary force of some400,000,   Equally, Service life must retain its full attractiveness inthe future relative to other opportunities open to young men if presentrecruiting targets are to be fulfilled.     From the evidence submittedto us it is clearly difficult to isolate the effects of the various factors which influence either recruitment or retention of personnel.It is also impossible to demonstrate a statistical relationship between any one of these factors (including pay) and the ability of theServices to reach their manpower targets.   The manpower position,however, is such that a relative worsening of any one of the majorfactors is likely in our view to make it more difficult for theServices to achieve their targets. 1,125.     The assurance of a biennial pay review by which Service emoluments are brought broadly into line with those outside the Services has now beenin existence for some years.    It features in the leaflets and bookletsdesigned to attract recruits and provides a. basis for the careerexpectations of those who have joined.     It could not in our view bo
abruptly withdrawn without adversely affecting the retention of personnel when a period of engagement has been completed as well asrecruitment.     Unless and until the Government duly notifies themembers of the Armed Forces that a new system of review of theiremoluments is to be adopted, we consider that there is a commitment.26.     We consider accordingly that the 1966 review should bo carried out and implemented in the same way as previous reviews and that theincrease above the average annual rate of increase laid down in theWhite Paper, which is produced by the application of an agreed formula,is justified,27.     We noted earlier that we were not asked to comment on the operationof the Grigg formula.     We would point out, however, that the formulais based entirely on the principle of comparability with movements inee.rrri.ngs in outside employment, whereas the White Paper on Prices and incomes Policy suggests that such comparisons should carry &quot;lessweight than hitherto&quot; in the determination of incomes.    If changes inArmed Forces&apos; pay continue to bo made, as in the past, considerably in arrear of changes in earnings elsewhere, the pressures to catch up withthose changes will remain considerable^ on grounds both of equalityand tho nood to attract and retain tho nooooooiry manpower.    For thisreason alone comparability will inevitably play a continuing role inthe determination of Service pay,    But the Government may wish toconsider whether the somewhat crude application of the principle of comparability, enshrined in tho Grigg formula, is reconcilable with theWhite Paper, and whether greater account should be taken of the other factors set out therein for tho determination of pay in the economy generally,28,     This report represents the -viewsof the Board as a whole, althoughthe absence of Mr. P. E, Trench prevents him from appending hissignature to it.10.

CHAPTER   1THE   reference ,   The Government requested us on 25th November 1965, &quot;to examine, in relationto the White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639), the increases in salary for Higher Civil Service Grades recently recommended by theStanding Advisory Committee on the Pay of the Higher Civil Service.2.   The Standing Advisory Committee came into being in February 1957 following the Report of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (1953-55).     Itundertakes from time to time reviews of the pay of the Higher Civil Serviceeither on its own initiative or at the Government&apos;s request.     In either case it acts as an independent body, reaches its conclusions independently: ifof Government as an employer, and submits its recommendations directly tothe Prime Minister,     Its recommendations affect about 8,000 civil servants in all;   of this total,nearly 1.,200 are members of the Administrative Class,and the remainder includes members of the Executive Class and of the professional, scientific and other specialist classes in the Higher CivilService.     This is the third major salary review to be conducted by theCommittee since it was set up.3.   The White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy was published by theGovernment in April 1965 as the result of an agreement between it, theemployers organisations and the Trades Union Congress.     The White Papersets out principles and criteria whereby movements in wages, salaries and--prices should be judged.     In issuing the White Paper Government was acting,not as an employer, but as a custodian of the national interest.     Ininterpreting any particular case in the light of the White Paper we, likethe Standing Advisory Committee, act as an independent body and reach our conclusions independently of Government as an employer.- 1 -
4,   The Government&apos;s request to us to examine the Standing AdvisoryCommittee&apos;s recommendations poses two questions.     First, are therecommendations in keeping with the TThite Paper which was publishedsome years after the report of the Royal Commission on the CivilService, on whose findings the constitution and function of the standing advisory Committee are based?     Secondly, to what extent should thefuture task of the Standing Advisory Committee be affected by the white paper?     We treat each of these questions in turn.
Secretary of the Cabinet	3	9,200	+	315	* 3.5*   Other Permanent Secretaries	30	8,600	+	315	4- 3.8*   Deputy Secretaries	70	6,300	+	415	* 7.1Under Secretaries	265	5,250	+	550	+ 11.7Assistant Secretaries	801	3,500 - A,500	+	200	* 6.1 to   4.77.   It was recommended that the increases should take effect from 1stSeptember 1965; the last adjustment for Assistant Secretaries was 1stJanuary 1964, end for all other grades 1st August 1963.*   Grades which will no longer, if the Standing Advisory Committee&apos;srecommendations are accepted, receive the London allowance.    UnderSecretaries and Assistant Secretaries will continue to receive anInner London allowance of  85 a year where appropriate;   this was increased from  65 on 1st January 1964.- 3 -CHAPTER   2THE   COMMITTEE&apos;S   RECOMMENDATIONS5,   The Standing Advisory Committee decided early this year to undertake the review leading to its recommendations because pay settlements for other categories of senior civil servants had compressed the differentialsbetween them and the Higher Civil Service.     In order to help it reachits recommendations it collected information about how salaries in other public services and in broadly comparable employment outside the publicservice had moved since its last general review which was completed inJuly 1963.     This information was given to it in confidence and we havebeen given an indication of the broad conclusions drawn from it by theCommittee.6.   We give below the Committee&apos;s specific recommendations, the percentage increase they represent on existing salaries and the number of officials in each grade.Numbers     per pent*   Joint Permanent secretaries to the Treasury and
r 4 &quot;In considering the relationship of these proposed increases to theaverage annual rate of increase suggested in the White Paper, it isnecessary to take :&apos;.nto account the intervals at which pay adjustmentsare made for the Higher Civil Service.     The weighted rate of increase for Higher Civi: Service grades as a whole is about 6 per cent.     the pay or the High ;r Civil Service is adjusted infrequently;    this is onlythe third major   review since the Standing Advisory Committee was formed in 1957.     Assuming that future reviews take place at similar intervals,the 6 per cer: c increase proposed will result in an annual rate of increase tha-   is within the standard laid down in the White Paper.Applying the same considerations to the increase proposed for the variousgrades, only that for Under Secretaries is likely to he above thestandard and, prima facie, any question of consistency with the white paper arises only in relation to this grade.     To this we now turn.The Administrative Class numbers some 2,500 out of a total Civil Serviceof well over one million employees.     Direct recruitment to theAdministrative Class is primarily from graduates who are required tohave a First or Second Class Honours Degree and to pass a rigorousentrance examination.     The pool of talent is small and is drawn on in competition with the universities, professions, industry and commerce.To such graduates the initial salary offered on appointment is of lesssignificance than the salary ranges and promotion prospects available during the course of their career?.The salaries of the lower grades of the Administrative Class, namely,Assistant Principals and Principals, are not reviewed by the standing advisory Committee. These salaries have, in fact, moved broadly in line with those paid elsewhere. They have been increased at regular intervals as a result of the central pay settlements that cover thegreater part of the non-industrial Civil Service, and of the findings of less frequent pay research surveys.
XI,   This has led, during the last two years, to a considerable narrowingof the differentials between these grades and the Higher Civil Service.Thus between 1st January 1964 (when the salaries of assistant secretaries were last increased) and 1st January 1966 (when the salaries of Principals will be increased by 3? per cent under a three-year pay agreement) the gap between the Assistant Secretaries&apos; minimum and&apos;thePrincipals&apos; maximum will have been reduced from  400 to  193.Similarly, since 1st January 1964 the gap betxveen the assistant secretaries&apos; maximum and the Under Secretaries&apos;  salary has been only. 400 compared with the  800 recommended by the Standing AdvisoryCommittee in July 1963c     These pressures have resulted in a salary structure which has compressed the differentials at the point where theresponsibility of the posts increases significantly,.     It is essentialthat this greater responsibility be acknowledged through an appropriatelyhigher salary level.     Otherwise the career prospect will not besufficient attraction to recruit and retain the type of person that theCivil Service requires.12.   The problems of recruitment to the Civil Service were commented on inthe Sixth Report of the Estimates Committee published in August 1965-The Committee noted that the shortage of Principals, which wasattributed to poor recruitment in the middle fifties became acute in1964, and &quot;was accentuated by fresh demands on the Service on the advent of the present administration&quot;.     The Estimates Committee have recommended that a committee, or if necessary a royal commission, shouldbe appointed to examine and report upon the structure, recruitment and management of the Civil Servicee     A wide ranging report of this kindwill&apos; no doubt take some considerable time to formulate.     Lookingimmediately at the situation as it is now our conclusion is thatrecruitment has not kept pace with the increase in the work load, whichbecause of the shortage of staff at the lower levels must addconsiderably to the load at higher levels.     Between i960 and 1965 we- 5 -
- 6 -understand that the Civil Service Commission advertised vacancies for nearly 500 Assistant Principals, but only just over 300 were succesful and took up appointments.     vra stage in the Administrative Class is notlarge, but those leaving tend to be in the higher ranks and includepeople whose loss can have a significant effect on the futureperformance of the Class.T7e have stated that the Standing Advisory Committee collected information a confidential basis about the movement of earnings, in comparableposts outside the Civil Service.     It is clear from their report thatthe evidence on movements of other incomes was not, however,  one ofthe primary considerations in their minds when they were framing their recommendations.     We understand, nevertheless, that their enquiriesleft no room for doubt that the average annual increase in the twoyears from April 1963 of salaries and earnings in broadly comparableemployment outside the public sector was appreciably greater than theaverage annual increase for the Higher Civil Service as a whole whichwould result from their recommendations.^e consider, in the light of this evidence, that the salary structure of the Administrative Class must be improved if the Civil Service isto compete fairly with others for its share of talented people, and provide rewards that are commensurate with the responsibilitiescarried by the various higher grades.     The higher percentage increaserecommended by the Standing Advisory Committee for Under Secretariesis, in our view, a necessary step towards this objective and in keeping with the criteria of the White Paper.In making their recommendation, the Standing Advisory Committee statedthat the new rates did not fully reflect its &quot;assessment of what would constitute fair and reasonable remuneration for the grades in question&quot;The Committee was, however, influenced in its judgement by its view of&quot;the economic problems confronting the country&quot;.     The Committee
concluded:    &quot;We should not......think it right for those concerned tobe indefinitely penalised by a decision taken in the light of aparticular economic situation, and we therefore intend to review the salaries of these grades earlier than would otherwise be the case&quot;,l6.     In so far as we have been requested to examine the Standing AdvisoryCommittee&apos;s recommendations in the light of the White Paper on prices and Incomes Policy, we would comment that the White Paper is not concerned only with a period of particular economic difficulty.     It isconcerned with the long-term problems of orderly economic growth, andsets out guidance to achieve this end.     The White Paper should be interpreted in the light of its long term aims.17.     Finally we turn to the question of how the Standing Advisory Committeeshould carry out its task of reviewing the pay of the Higher CivilService in the light of the white Paper that was published after itsformation,,     We have no doubt of the value to the Government as an employer, to its employees, and to the relations between them of aCommittee which, either on its own initiative or on request, makesrecommendations about pay in a spirit of independence and objectivity,irre consider it of the greatest importance that the independent positionof the Committee should, and should be seen to, be maintained,18.     Government, however, acting not in its capacity as an employer but asa custodian of the national interest has, in agreement with therepresentative organisations of employers and employed, propounded a set of principles which should in future govern all pay increases.It would clearly be illogical if those principles were applied to others but not to Government Itself as an employer.     We suggestaccordingly that Government and its staff, as represented in theNational Staff Side, should invite the Standing Advisory Committee, in framing its future recommendations, to take account of the White paper and of our interpretation of it in paragraph Il6 above.     Such an:;,&apos;Vt..&apos;.;;:! Vinvitation to the Committee to pay regard to criteria which are- 7 -
- 8 -intended to be of universal application would not represent anyderogation from the independence of the Committee, would not in anyway impair its ability to initiate salary reviews on its own account,irrespective of the wishes of Government as an employer, and would not affect its own ultimate responsibility for the recommendations whichit might make.19,       To summarise, the increase proposed by the standing-Advisory Committeefor the Higher Civil Service as a whole is within the terms of theWhite Paper and appreciably less than the average increase in earnings in broadly comparable employment outside the public sector.     It will thus contribute to the need described in the White Paper to balanceabove average increases in income with increases below average.Against this background:-(i) We consider the recommendations of the Standing AdvisoryCommittee on salaries for Higher Civil Service grades to bein accord with the white Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy.(ii) We therefore recommend that the Government should put therecommendations into effect as from 1st September 19^5.(iii) We recommend that for the future, Government and theNational Staff Side should invite the Standing AdvisoryCommittee, in framing recommendations either on its own initiative or on request, to teke into account the white paper on Prices and Incomes Policy, recognising that it is designed to promote orderly economic growth and thus to be applicable over the long term.20.     This report represents the views of the Board as a whole, although theabsence of Mr. P.E. Trench prevents him from appending his signatureto it.
