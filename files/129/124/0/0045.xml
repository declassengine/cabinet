The PrimeMinister has accordingly appointed a Committee to carry out these duties, consisting of&apos;:-Prime Minister  (in the Chair)First Secretary of StateLord PresidentChancellor of the ExchequerForeign secretary minister of Housing and Local GovernmentMinister of LabourPaymaster Generalii2.      The Secretaries of the Committee will be Mr.  P. Rogers,Mr. C. B. Nixon and Mr. M. J. Moriarty of the Cabinet Office.3.      A note is annexed on the procedure for submitting matters to theElection Business Committee and for dealing with enquiries or requests for information, particularly by Parliamentary candidates, during theElection campaign.(Signed)    BURKE trend cabinet Office, S, W. I. ,2nd March, 1966.GENERAL ELECTION;  REPLIES TO ENQUIRIESIt is desirable that all Departments should, so far as possible,follow a common procedure in dealing with enquiries or requests forinformation, particularly by Parliamentary candidates, during theElection campaign.-1-V 0 3
2.      Departments should provide any Parliamentary candidate withfactual information which is readily available and is not confidential.Such information should not, however, be provided if its extractionwould require a substantial use of official time;  a useful criterion is whether information would be extracted for the purpose of a reply to a parliamentary Question.    Local and regional offices should deal onthis basis with any enquiries addressed to them; but they should referdoubtful cases to the headquarters of their Department for decision.3.      For information not of a factual nature, or for guidance on policy,Labour candidates and their agents are expected to look to TransportHouse.    In order to prevent much separate and unco-ordinatedcorrespondence between Transport House and individual GovernmentDepartments j the Election Business Committee of the Cabinet has beenappointed to supervise the work of advising Government candidates aboutthe replies which they should return to questionnaires and other enquiriesput to them during the campaign.     Transport House will accordinglycollate questionnaires or particular questions which they receive, andnormally will prepare first drafts of replies.    All drafts will be forwarded to the Paymaster General who will in appropriate casesobtain,through the Election Business Committee, the comments of theMinisters concerned upon them in order to check the information endarguments originally supplied by Transport House.     The Secretary ofthe Committee will, where this seems necessary in the light of aMinisters comments or the comments of Transport House, submit finaldrafts of replies for the Committee&apos;s approval.     Transport House willthereafter be responsible for passing on the necessary guidance to candidates.4.      Requests for information not of a factual nature, or policyenquiries from Labour candidates, which are addressed to departments should normally be referred, through ministers Private Offices, to the paymaster-General, accompanied, in appropriate cases, by advice fromthe Ministers on how such enquiries should be answered and on thequestion whether they are of such a nature as to require considerationby the Election Business Committee.    A copy of any such communication should be sent to the Secretary of the Election Business Committee at theCabinet Office.5.      Requests for information not of a factual nature, or policyenquiries which are addressed to Departments by individual members ofthe public, are usually answered by or on behalf of the responsible ministers,    During the Election campaign this procedure is stillcorrect, but Ministers should arrange for copies of the correspondenceto be sent to both Transport House and the Secretary of the ElectionBusiness Committee.6.      Enquiries addressed to Departments from any quarter may call for an important statement of policy to be made by the minister concerned.     In that event a Minister may decide himself to seek the guidance of the Election Business Committee j  and in any case it wouldbe advisable to inform the Secretary of the Committee of the enquiry and of the terms of the reply.-2-
7.   The function of initiating guidance to Labour candidates in caseswhere no issue of policy is concerned normally belongs to TransportHouse,    Exceptionally, Ministers may wish to suggest topics on whichguidance should be given;     In these instances, suggestions should besent to Transport House who will prepare first drafts and forward themto the Paymaster General, who will arrange for them to be considered,as necessary, by the Election Business Committee,-3-CQ EVIDENTIAL
