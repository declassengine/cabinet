Draft White Paper AnnexBROADCASTING1 .     On taking office, the Government succeeded to a number ofunresolved problems of broadcasting policy.    Chief among them was the question of e.c. finance.    On colour television, thoughthe previous administration had expressed their intention toauthorise a start on a modest scale, a final decision on thesystem of transmission had been reserved in the hope that a broadmeasure of agreement on the adoption of a common system for europe would be achieved at a meeting of the international organisationconcerned in Vienna in the Spring of 1965. On local sound broadcasting, the previous administration had undertaken to review their earlier conclusion that this development shouldnot command a high priority.2,     The previous administration had also stated their intentionof authorising a second programme of independent televisionduring 1965 unless financial or other obstacles were Ihsurmoun-table at that stage.    The Government are not yet in a positionto announce a final decision on this question.3.      The Government believe that broadcast television has a major part to play in the development of a University of the Air and aseparate white paper will be published on this subject.Principles governing the formulation of policyho      Given the problems awaiting them, and the possibilities forthe future, the Government have approached their task in thelight of the six principles laid down during the debate onMay 13th,  1965.5.      The principles were %(i)    A profound belief in the growing importance of radio and television to the community and the world.(ii)    A wish to see television and radio expand, as rapidly as national resources permit, to meet important nationalneeds and to develop still further their potential for education, information and entertainment.(iii)    A recognition that technological changes have opened,  up new possibilities, for international programme exchanges and colour television.(iv)    A determination to uphold and entrench the principlecf public service in all future television and radiodevelopment, this principle to be reflected in its purposes,in the allocation of channels, in the maintenance of programmestandards, in public accountability without political-interference, and in the integrity and independence of programme provision.(v)    A desire to permit the greatest possible freedom and scope for creative talent to express itself through radio and television, and hence, the encouragement of a diversityof outlets.- 1 -
(vi)   A readiness to consider various methods by whichbroadcasting can be financed, including (alone or in combination, broadcast licences, exchequer grants, localgovernment grants and revenue from advertising under propersupervision.6.     Given these principles, which the Government believe command general acceptance, the proposals contained in this White Papermust be taken and seen together as a whole rather than as separatesolutions to individual problems.    The most important considera-tion throughout has been the listeners and viewers for whomthe services are provided.    The forms of organisation and finance must be subordinated to them and not vice-versa.    Withthis in mind the Government have thought it right to entertainand consider all the various ideas and proposals put to them on the development, and organisation, of broadcasting services.THE FINANCES OF THE BBC7.     The BBC were committed by decisions taken by the previous administration, following the report of the PilkingtonCommittee, to undertake major expansion of their services,namely:-(a) BBC-2(b) self-contained television services for Scotland andWales(c) more hours for sound broadcasting(d) more adult education programmes and   (e)   a start on colour television.Except for colour television, these decisions, which werewelcomed on all sides when they were announced, have been implemented-8.      The understanding on which the BBC proceeded to carry out a programme of expansion and development was that they wouldbe afforded sufficient income to finance adequate services,9o     In October, 1964? the BBC informed the Government that the corporations deficit in the Home Services would amount tosome  125m. by April,  1969? if nothing were done to increase their income and no other compensatory steps were taken.    now that most households have television and radio the BBC can nolonger look to regular increases in the total number of licencesas a substantial source of additional income.    Accordingly,the3/ asked that the combined sound and television licence feeshould be raised from  4 to  6, and the sound only licence feefrom  1 to  1 5s, Od,, the increases to take effect on1st April, 1965.    It was, of course, the Government&apos;s dutyfirst to satisfy themselves that the increase sought by theCorporation was justified.    As however, the BBC1s deficit was rapidly increasing, immediate action was necessary.    So,pending the outcome of their comprehensive survey of broadcasting policy - including a rigorous enquiry into the BBC&apos;s finances -the Government authorised an increase in the combined licence fee from  4 to  5; and in the sound only fee from  1 to  1 5s. Od,Both increases took effect on 1st August, 1965.- 2 -
The remaining deficit10.    The Government have completed their review of the BBC1sfinances.    In the course of the review, they have satisfied themselves that the Corporation operate with efficiency,,The    Government    review confirmed also that the estimatedgrowth in the BECs expenditure derived very largely from theadditional commitments they were asked to undertake.    There is thus no scope for major savings except through drastic cuts inthe services provided and in course of provision.    Cuts of thiskind would restrict the range and lower the quality of theservices of broadcasting provided by the BBC for the viewing andlistening public.    The Government reject this course.11.    If the Corporations commitments are to remain unchanged,and if no further steps are taken to provide additional income,the overall financial prospect with which they would be faced isthat their cumulative deficit on the Home Services which stood at some  5m.  on 31st March,  1965 can be expected to rise to nearly  17m. by the end of 1966-67 and to more than  30m. by theend of 1967-68.    And if the extended hours of television broad-casting which the Government intend to authorise were to be fully utilised the figures would be even higher.Borrowing12.    Under the bbc s Charter, the Corporation^ borrowing powers are limited to 10m. for temporary banking accommodation; and 20m. for capital purposes.For the BBC, borrowing does not generate additional revenue, butonly increases interest charges.    It does not, therefore, offer a permanent solution to the BBC1s financial problem.    The Governmentreject the view that the answer to the Corporation1s difficultiesis to increase their borrowing powers.Licence evasion13.    It has been reliably estimated that of the gross revenueamounting to  80m. payable in a full year, some  9m. is lost through evasion most of this loss arising from the unlicenseduse of television sets.    This cannot be allowed to continue.Honest viewers and listeners   are, in effect, paying for thedishonesty of the evaders.1A&apos;.*   Steps have already been taken by the Postmaster general to tighten up his Departments existing counter-evasion measures,in co-operation with the BBC.    Work is also in progress on thepossibility of transferring licence records on to computers;this would provide fuller and more up-to-date information on which to take action and would reduce the costs of administering the licence system.    But there is a limit to what can be done without disproportionate expenditure and these measures by themselves will not suffice&apos;.15.    The Government is therefore consulting the retailers andrental companies to see what contribution they can make to thetask of combatting evasion.    The possibilities the Governmenthave in mind are that the sale of television sets would in future be notified to the Post Office by retailers and that rental companies would undertake to ensure that their sets were licenced.    any necessary legislation would be introduced as soon as practicable.
16,    In the nature of the case, no exact estimate is possible ofthe financial effect of these various measures.    The new measures proposed in the previous paragraph are, by their nature,relatively slow-acting since they only take effect when peoplerenew their sets.    But the net yield from licence fees mightbe raised by some  2m. in 1967-68, rising to  7m. in 1971-72.liethods of increasing the BBC&quot; s income17.    Even if the best expectations of the counter-evasion measures are in fact realised, they will not produce anything like enoughextra money to meat the BBCs needs.   Basically, there are only three ways of increasing the BBCs income: an increase in the licence fee; directExchequer subvention; and re-vane fern &quot;fee sale of advertising trae in the Corporation&apos;sprogrammes.The licence-fee system18.    The Government are convinced that the licence-fee system must remain the basic means of financing the BBC.    It is a well-established constitutional device, affording the BBC a guarantee of assured income; and freedom from detailed control and outsideintervention.    However, if the BBC were to continue to rely entirely on licence revenue, the combined fee would have to rise by  1before the end of this year and a further increase would be neededwithin a few years after that.    The amount and timing of theincrease v/ould depend largely on the trend of wages and prices inthe interim.    But a further  1 might be needed by the end of1968 or even earlier if the BBC were to take advantage of extendedhours of broadcasting which it is proposed to authorise.    TheGovernment do not think it right to call upon the public to accept a fartherincrease in the licence fees at this moment, so shortly after the increases introduced last August.Direct Exchequer Subvention19*    If the Corporation^ domestic services v/ere to be financed, evenin part, from general taxation unrelated to the licence fee, theywould be in a position very similar to that of a Government depart-rnent and would be liable to much the same kind of detailed control.Moreover it would involve a&apos;substantial increase in the level oftaxation.    The Government reject this method as incompatible with theindependence of the Corporation.Advertising Hevenue20.    Clause 13 of the BBC1s Licence and Agreement* forbids theCorporation to broadcast paid advertisements unless they firstseek to obtain the Postmaster General&apos;s written consent.    Thus,the initiative in this matter has been placed with the BBC,21.    In the past the broadcasting of advertisements by the BBC hasbeen opposed on the argument that a BBC largely financed from advertising could not at the same time satisfy the requirements ofthe listening public and of the advertisers.    It has also been represented that advertising by the BBC would fundamentally alter the nature of the competition between the Corporation and indepen-uent television; and that, though a limited amount of advertisingmight have no significant effect on the services, once it has been allowed the natural disposition would be to rely increasingly on itwhenever the   Corporation needed more money.*Cmnd. 2236, approved by affirmative resolution of the House ofCommons, January 196k.- h -CONFIDENTIAL
22.    The Government are not however persuaded that some strictlycontrolled advertising confined to one sound service that is alreadyseeking a large audience at all times would necessarily proveinimical to the Corporation&apos;s services.    Accordingly, they wouldbe willing to authorise the sale of advertising time, in the LightProgramme only, if the Corporation seek permission to do so.    in announcing their willingness to proceed in this way, the government note that advertising confined to the Light Programme would belimited in scale and not out of place in a service of this kind.Most important it would not alter the nature of the competition between the BBC and Independent Television.23.    Advertising on the Light Programme might, it is estimated, he expected to produce net additional annual revenue rising to some 7m. a year.BBC finance: summary2k.    The combined effect of advertising receipts on this scale andthe further measures proposed by the Government to combat licenceevasion could be expected to reduce the Corporation^ estimateddeficit (paragraph 11) to, say,  1Am. at the end of 1966-67 and 22m. at the end of 1967-68.25o    No further increase in the licence fee will be authoriseduntil these and the other measures proposed below have been allowed time to take effect.    Meanwhile the BBC will be expectedto exercise the strictest economy.COLOUR TELEVISIONChoice of system26.    As the Postmaster General has already announced, his TelevisionAdvisory Committee has recommended that colour television be introduceon the 625-line standard only, using the PAL system of transmission,.-27.    The Government accept this recommendation.    In doing so, theyrecord as a main consideration the expectation that the PAL system will be adopted in most Western European countries.    The possibilitycannot altogether be discounted that, at the meeting of theInternational Radio Consultative Committee due to take place in Osloin June of this year, another system might - against presentexpectations - find general acceptance for common use throughout europe.    In that event, the Government would naturally undertaketo take this into account, and if necessary reconsider their- decision.Line standard28.    The effect of the decision to confine colour television to the625-line standard is that only BBC 2 will be able to transmit incolour initially.    However, the Government re-affirm the decisionof the previous a,dmini strati on that all programmes in UHF should beon the 625-line standard and this will open the possibility ofcolour in all future television programmes.- 5 -CONFIDENTIAL
Timing of a start29.    After a slow start, colour television is now developing rapidly in North America, and some European countries have already announced their intention to open a colour service in late 1967.    this consideration argues in favour of an early start in this uountry.On the other hand the Government have of course had to weigh thedemands on resources to which a colour service would give rise overthe next few years.    The BBCs initial plans envisage that therewould be four hours of colour a week initially rising to about tenhours a week by the end of 1968.    The additional cost to them of broadcasting colour programme on this scale would only amount tosome  1m. to  2m. a year; consumer expenditure on receivers would be greater - it could be    as much as     100m. over the period up to1970.    However some of this expenditure would be balanced by a switchby viewers from consumer expenditure on other goods or services. It would be quite wrong to allow this country to fall behind in this new tech-nical field and to lose the export opportunities that the early introduction of a colour service would offer.    The Government have therefore decided that a regular colour service should be started in the autumn of 1967.A special licence fee30.    It would not be fair to ask viewers generally - many of whomwill not be able to receive colour programmes for some time to cometo bear the whole cost of the colour broadcasts which will only beseen in households able to afford the high cost of colour sets.The Government have decided therefore to introduce a supplementarylicence fee of  2 payable by households equipped to receive colourtransmissions.    The date for the introduction of the increasedlicence fee will be decided later.    This decision will also serve tounderline the Governments determination that the BBC shall continueto be financed principally by licence revenue.LOCAL SOUND broadcasting the technical considerations31.    There is no frequency space for a general service of localsound hroadcasting in the highly congested medium and long wavebandscovered by the ordinary domestic receivers and transistor portablesets.   There is frequency space available, however, in the very highfrequency (VHF) Band II; and, used intensively, under a co-ordinatednational plan, this could provide for some 350 local stations.Not all of these 350 locations woiild however coincide with consider-able centres of population but in practiced, terms some 200 towns andcities could be served.    A typical station would have a range of somefive miles.   More than one station would be needed to cover thelargest centres of population.During the hours of daylight, when there is less congestion inthe medium wave ban d,      some local sound transmissions on VHEmight be duplicated on medium wavelengths.    Some low power stationsmight be provided in such a way as not to interfere with existingstations transmitting the BBCs present sound   services (and thoseof other countries).    The advantage would be that broadcasts of thelocal stations could then be received by people without VHF receivers.Ti;ie purpose of a service of local broadcasting32. ^ Though the country is already well served by the national and regional sound services provided by the BBC, the Government believethat local sound radio could bring a new and revitalising element into- 6 -
broadcasting and make a valuable contribution to community life.Properly used, it would also have a useful part to play in education.33.    The Pilkington Committee concluded that worthwhile local sound broadcasting stations would transmit &quot;for a sufficient part of the broadcasting day, ^Tiaterial/of particular interoot to the localityserved by that station rather than to other localities.&quot;   In theWhite Paper of July 1962 the previous Administration said they e^gresd&quot;th t the justification for local sound broadcasting would bo theprovision of a service genuinely &quot;local&quot; in &quot;character&quot;.    TheGovernment share this view.31+.    It would be a misconception of the role of local sound hroadoast-ing to expect of it a service limited   to playing continuous &quot;pop&quot;music throughout the day.    In the first place, this would be to ignore their main purpose of providing an essentially local service.Insofar as there is a demand for a popular programme, mainly consist-ing of music, available throughout the day on a national channel,this can best be met by the BBC Light programme.   Moreover, local stations would . hav e     to pay for copyright and to observe the agreed amounts of &quot;needle-time&quot; negotiated with the phonographicindustry with the support of the Musicians&apos; Union.    This is not tosay that there is no place for &quot;pop&quot; music in local broadcasting.Organisation and finance35.    In considering how the service should be constituted, organised and financed, the Government have adopt3d a single practicalcriterion? how best to serve the essential purposes of local broad-casting.    It is against this background that the Government have considered the various claims to provide such a service.BBC stations36.    The BBC have expressed a willingness to mount a pilot scheme,-within the revenue from the present 25s.  sound licence fee, in somenine centres.    The Corporation have already undertaken a series ofclosed-circuit experiments which have shown the expertise and professional enthusiasm which the BBC would bring to the provision ofa service.    But the BBC is a unitary structure,  organised primarily to provide services on the national scale.    Though the corporation have expressed their readiness to afford managers of local stationsa great degree of freedom from day-to-day control from BroadcastingHouse, nevertheless the Government is not persuaded that a nationalorganisation which already has a monopoly in the provision of sound-broadcasting is best fitted to provide new local services.    Inaddition it would not, in the Governmenfs view, be right to ask, people living in area.s which could never receive BBC local stations&quot;to pay for them through licence fees.    Nor, in the present state ofBBC finances, would it be right to impose fresh and expensivecommitments on them.    The Government do not therefore propose to take up the BBCs offer to conduct a pilot scheme.Coiimiercial stations37.    The expectation is that, for many years to come, there wouldbe only one station serving any particular locality.    Such a station &apos;would have a monopoly for the sale of local advertising time.    More-over, It would be the perfectly proper objective and duty ofcommercial companies to secure a good return on the money invested in them.    The Government believe that this   would prove incompatible withthe need to provide a service which would find expression for theparticular interests and tastes of the   many widelydiffering   communities.     There is  another important
consideration to be borne in mind.    If a fully developed serviceof local commercial radio stations were to be established the advertising revenue diverted from the local newspapers might endanger the survival of many of them, which would detract fromcommunity life.   Moreover, if to avert that consequence localnewspapers were allowed to own the local stations themselves alocal monopoly of local news and comment would be established with even greater risks to local democracy.    Accordingly, theGovernment reject the proposal that a service should be providedby commercial companies.Community stations38.    The Government conclude that another solution is to be preferred namely, that local community stations might beestablished and operated on a public service footing under thecontrol of local broadcasting authorities composed of peopledrawn from the local community and sufficiently representativeof it.    They have therefore decided tc authorise the experimentalestablishment of stations on this basis.    The Postmaster general will be prepared to consider applications for the authorisation of local&quot; sound broadcasting stations from bodies of local people who will constitute themselves to sponsor an application and can satisfy him as to their suitability and competence.    Thegeneral conditions under which the Postmaster General will beprepared to authorise such stations will be published shortly.The Government would particularly welcome applications from theheadquarter towns of the new economic planning Kegions.Financing coiamunity stations39&apos;    The local broadcasting authorities would be charged with thewhole responsibility for finding the necessary finance, bothcapital and revenue.    A worthwhile service must be able to count upon a regular and sufficient income.    Though the Government would hope that a sense of pride of community would lead local interests to contribute financial and other help to their station, they recognise that this may not suffice.    The broadcasting authorities would therefore be empowered to sell advertising time, on condition that the amount of advertising would be no more than was needed to finance the service.    Each authority would berequired to transmit a proper proportion of educational material,in some cases no doubt provided on behalf of local educationauthorities, colleges and universities, who would in that caseprovide or finance the programmes.   Apart from these cases, these stations would not be directly financed by the rates, and could develop in such a way as to become themselves patrons of localcultural life.    They v/ould not be subject to local authoritycontrol in matters of programme content; in that respect following the practice of independence enjoyed by the BBC and the ITA.Effect on the presshO,   Many local newspapers which saw the prospect of commerciallocal sound broadcasting as posing a threat to their continued existence can -take seme reassurance from these proposals.    It is to be acondition of the establishment of a local station that it mustnot be profit-making; and the Government are satisfied that, withthis safeguard, such stations could play a useful part i- enrigh-ing community life without unfair competition.    In addit en it iscertainly visualised that leaders of the local press would be appropriate people to serve on local broadcasting authorities.Moreover, local stations would almost certainly require and pay for services of news and information supplied by local newspapers.- 8 -

In&apos; addit on it iscertainly visualised that leaders of the local press would be appropriate people to serve on local broadcasting authorities.Moreover, local stations would almost certainly require and pay for services of news and information supplied by local newspapers.
Term of &quot;the intial licences41.    In the Government&apos;s view, four years should be enough forthe initial period of the licence and agreement concluded with each authority.    Towards the end of the period the working of the experiments would be reviewed and the constitution and organisationof the service on a longer-term basis decided in the light of experience.    A decision of this importance, involving as it does the breaking of the BBC sound monopoly, and the beginnings of anentirely new type of broadcasting organisation bas^d on publicservice principles with a mixed revenue, ought to be reviewed at such a stage in its life,A NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMMISSIONk2.    Broadcasting is developing so fast that Committees of Enquiryat twelve-yoar intervals do not come sufficiently frequently toadvise on all the problems that arise in this field.    For thisreason the Government have decided to establish a Natri onal BroadcnsHngCommission with the following terms of reference&quot;To advise the Postmaster General on such questions relating to the domestic broadcasting services of theUnited Kingdom, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Manas he may refer tc it&quot;.The problems of the BBCs external services are different in kindfrom those of the domestic services and it is not contemplated thatthese would be referred to the Commission.43.    The chairman and members will be selected on the basis of theindividual contributions they could make and not as representativesof the public in general or any sectional interests.    They will beappointed by the Postmaster General who proposes to invite, inaddition the Vice Chairman of the BBC and Deputy Chairman of theITA to join the Commission.44.    The main functions of the Commission would be to advise on major questions of broadcasting policy.    Though it would be opento the Postmaster General to refer to the Commission broad andgeneral questions relating to programme standards he would not refer-to it nor would it entertain, individual complaints about particularprogrammes.    The Commission would report to the Postmaster general who would present its report to Parliament for consideration andwho    would take account of it in his major decisions.    TheCommission&apos;s advice to the Postmaster General would not itself bemade binding on the broadcasting authorities, whose discretion inthe discharge of their responsibilities must remain unqualified..,The Commission would however provide a valuable and independentsource of advice entirely free of Government influence upon issues of policy as and when they arise.    The broadcasting authoritiesincluding the new local broadcasting authorities would certainlywish to take serious account of this expression of opinion along with.that expressed in Parliament, the press and direct repre-sentations from members of the public,45,    In summary, the Commission&apos;s purpose would be to provide theGovernment with advice on the issues of policy referred to it andto reinforce the methods by which public opinion is brought to bearon the broadcasting authorities; but it would neither displace thepresent agencies through which that opinion expresses itself, norderogate from the ,responsibility of the authorities for the programmes they broadcast.- 9 -
CONFIDENTIAL ^ 0- ,     218HOURS Off broadcasting the Government have considered the question of extended hoursof television broadcasting by the BBC and the ITA.    It is arguedagainst any extension for the time being that it would impose agreater burden on the production resources of television, con-sidered as a whole, than they can meet (without risk of a loss of programme quality) at a time when BBC 2 is developing and whenthe University of the Air is to be established.   Moreover, theBBCs financial difficulties would bo sharpened if they wore to match on BBC 1 a large increase in hours on independent television.On the other hand apart from the general argument againstrestriction, there is the case of the shift workers and others whoare at work during the main viewing hours.    And there are also thehousewives, invalids and elderly people and others who are athomo during the day.    It is wrong that they should continue to be denied the choice of looking at television then.47,    The Governments conclusion is that while the PostmasterGeneral&apos;s powers of control over broadcasting hours must remain,the time has come for a considerable increase in the permittedhours.More educational broadcasting48.   The Government consider, however, that within the extendedhours a greater place should be found for educational programmes and they are therefore discussing with the broadcasting authorities the arrangeEients to provide for this and, in the case of the ITA,to provide also for experiments within the t^rms of the TelevisionAct 1964, which allows the ITA to seek out educational programmesfrom sources other than the programme companies.    In this way,the ITA might develop still further its existing role as &quot;publisher&quot;of programmes, in this case without the intervention of advertisingmatter.    These programmes would be financed by the Authorityitself.PAY TELEVISION49.    Under the previous administration licences were issued to three companies authorising them to mount an experimental serviceof pay television.    All but one of the companies decided not toproceed with the experiments and the remaining company (PayTelevision Ltd.) began to provide a service in January, 1966.The Government will keep the experiment under review.CONCLUSION50.    The BBCs Charter and the Television Act expire in 1976.The Government believe that the developments outlined in this paper should set the pattern for the growth and expansion of broadcasting as a public service for the remainder of the decade.Insofar as further decisions will be required in the interim,they will have advice of the National Broadcasting Commission.- 10 -CONFIDENTIAL
