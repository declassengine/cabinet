THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 1824th January, 1?66CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE 1966-67;  OVERSEAS INFORMATIONSERVICESNote by the Chief Secretary, treasury in accordance with the decision of tile Cabinet on 20th January(CC(66) 2nd Conclusions, Minute 2) I circulate a paper by officialsshowing what cuts would be needed to reduce the overseas informationestimates from  31. 6 million to  30. 6 million.The paper was necessarily drafted at short notice.    Naturallyin the tune available neither I nor the other Ministers concerned would wish to be committed to all the comments expressed in it.    I hope,however, that the figures in Annex B will give the Cabinet the facts onwhich to base a decision.J. D.Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1.24th January, 1966COPY NO.
OVERSEAS INFORMATION ESTIMATES 1966-57Report by OfficialsThis paper shows, at Annex A, the broad breakdown ofexpenditure which would be covered by a total provision of  31.6 million for overseas information next year, and at Annex B the cuts needed toreduce the total to  30.6 million, taking into account the Cabinefs wishto avoid cuts in broadcasting expenditure or in activities which promoteexports.2.       The draft Estimates of  32,6 million included  1.2 million ofrisen costs, mostly due to pay awards.    Departments had madesubstantial economies to accommodate these risen costs, the MontrealExhibition and the reconstruction of the Middle East Relay Station withinthe total of  32.6 million.(a) The further cuts have been spread over all forms of informationactivity in such a way as to do least harm.    So far as broadcasting isconcerned a reduction of  519, 000 has been achieved by omitting provisionfor certain proposed new expenditures not of high priority, but withoutcutting into existing services;  and by reducing the provision for rebuildingthe Middle East Relay Station on Masirah Island in the light of the latest estimates of what  is expected to be spent.(b) The provision for the British Information Services (BIS) abroadhas been reduced by  364, 000 from a total of  9. 2 million.    We have sought to avoid cuts in the fields most directly concerned with exportpromotion.    But there is no clear distinction between export promotionand other information work;  the same men and media serve both.    any reduction in the scale of information activity must inevitably thereforeeffect export promotion.3.       Annex B to this paper showing the effect of a further cut from 31.6 million to  30.6 million also calls for some explanatory comment.The saving of a further million could be achieved by the suspension of allwork on the Middle East Relay Station in 1966-67, the deferment offurther BBC plans for improving their overseas Services and the abolitionof e.g., the Hebrew and Albanian Services, coupled with further cuts of 160, 000 in provision for the British Council and of  180, 000 in provisionfor BIS.    But, if.no further cuts were made in the estimates for the BBCExternal Services, an additional sum amounting to  650,000 would have tobe found by the British Council and the Information Services.    Dividingthis sum equally between them (since there has been insufficient time forany detailed study of relative priorities) the total cut which the british council would have to bear, as compared with the figtxre of  10.4 millionincluded in the original  32.6 million would be  645, 000.     corresponding figures for BIS would be  9.2 million and  850,000.    By the nature ofthe British Council&apos;s work virtually the wholes of their cut would ha.ve to fall on overseas posts and would involve withdrawal from a number of countries, large reductions in locally engaged staff and probably someredundancy among established staff.    This would necessarily affect theCouncil&apos;s educational work in some developing countries.    In the case ofthe Information Services most of the cut would have to fall on theproduction of material by the COI, but the scope for economies here is limited by the need to provide an adequate service for those parts of theinformation machine overseas which cannot safely be cut.    There would thus have to be a substantial closure of information posts overseas.-1-
