THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1966C (66) 16 Copy No.   6 g28th January, 1966CABINETFRANCE: GENERAL DE GAULLES FOREIGN POLICYOVER THE NEXT TWO YEARSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsGeneralThere must be considerable uncertainty in any forecast ofFrench policy over the next two years, particularly as general de Gaulle has made it clear in his writings that the leader mustclothe his intentions in mystery. But, since British interests will beaffected by French actions in a number of important ways, I thinkit worth attempting a forecast in order that we may forearmourselves if we can. I am therefore circulating this paper to myCabinet colleagues as background against which to considerparticular questions as they arise over the coming months.2. The mainspring of General de Gaulle&apos;s policy is his belief that France must play a leading part in world affairs separate from and to some extent in conflict with the policies of the United States.In factde Gaulle, and his propaganda, is working against UnitedStates interests around the world. In particular, he has come to insist with ever growing emphasis on the need for France to freeherself from &quot; subordination &quot; to the United States in the NATOsystem. It is uncertain what his ultimate objective in world affairsmay be, since he has defined it differently at different times; itmay be that there is no positive objective other than the assertionof French independence of action in all fields. The following paragraphs describe probable French actions, which are of a largelynegative nature, in the main areas of policy in which Britishinterests are, or may be, closely affected. In many of these areasGaullist France already stands aside from the Western Alliance,both in her political and defence philosophies and on specificissues, and her policy is already in varying degrees contrary toBritish interests.North Atlantic Treaty organisation. Since 1962 France has reduced bit by bit her participation in NATO and has frequently resorted to an attitude of obstruction.Her spokesmen have indicated that, while France is prepared to6511A
accept some political consultation, she rejects co-ordinated policy or military integration. Recently General de Gaulle has taken theline that France will be out of NATO by 1969 at the latest, andthat there can be no foreign troops in France not under french command.4. French statements are contradictory in detail, but we must assume that some further step will be taken early in 1966 to start the withdrawal of France from the integrated commandarrangements in NATO. This may initially take the form ofproposing changes in the bilateral Franco-American agreementsgoverning United States military establishments in France.Progressively, however, the General may demand the removal ofintegrated establishments, including NATO military headquarters,from France and the replacement of NATO as now constituted bybilateral arrangements. He may still accept some integratedcommand over Allied forces in Germany. If any agreement were reached within the alliance on giving the Germans a greater share in nuclear strategy (e.g., through the McNamara Special Committee),de Gaulle could well use this as a pretext for accelerating his actionagainst NATO. He may, however, hope that by dint of sapping and mining during the next two years he may have so weakened the alliance as to make it unnecessary for him formally to terminateFrench participation in 1969.5. We do not want to go through the expensive and time-wasting business of removing NATO from France, especially as we might want to return there if the General disappeared (andNATO might then again be welcome). But we cannot accept the break-up of the integrated structure; and, if necessary, NATO cansurvive without France.6. We can bring this home to the General and to french public opinion by showing that we have plans to keep NATO in being whatever he does and that France will suffer more thanNATO from a breach. If we cannot deter de Gaulle, we mustminimise the damage. We can do this by playing things along,by taking care not to precipitate a crisis before the General does,by keeping any conflict on the narrowest possible front and generally by not presenting him with the initiative by showing tooobvious an interest in his intentions. We have a number of legal and financial cards in our hand to enable us to spin out discussionsif the French do move. It may not, however, be easy to embroilde Gaulle in interminable discussions if he does not wish to beembroiled. While therefore playing for time may be our most effective policy, we can only succeed in avoiding a French break with NATO if the General fails to pursue his policy with hiscustomary vigour or if he dies or is ousted from power before his action is completed.7. The principal consequence for Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentof this policy is that within the next two years France is likely tohave ceased to be an effective NATO partner. We may have had totake decisions about resiting (and paying our share in the resiting)
secret -      114of NATO facilities and headquarters now in France, and to reorganise our military planning to take account of the gap in nato caused by a French withdrawal. We shall probably have to review our relations with France over military installations, research and development and co-operation in the defence and weaponsfield. We shall also have to review our co-operation with france in other fields from the viewpoint of our security interests; it may,for example, become impossible to reconcile an exclusivelybilateral co-operation with her over a range of technological and defence projects in the aviation, electronics and space fields, with ourloyalty to NATO as a whole.European Economic Community8. The timing of the GeneraFs next moves regarding theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) and the length to whichhe will be prepared to go towards breaking up the Communitycannot accurately be forecast. He may very well be content to seethe Community continue to exist as a purely trading arrangement,provided that it does not develop in the direction envisaged bythe Treaty of Rome. De Gaulle may reckon that in the EECcontext time is on his side. The longer he maintains the deadlockin the Community, the stronger may be the pressures on the Fiveto compromise, the harder it may be for them to present a united front against him, and the more likely will it be, so de Gaulle mightargue, that the momentum of progress towards a supra-nationalEurope will be checked. He may therefore hope to keep the EECsimmering while he acts against NATO. But he cannot entirelycontrol events himself. Now that he has unloosed this particularcrisis, he probably has less freedom of choice over the timing of future moves than he at present appears to have in the NATOcontext. De Gaulle may in fact have to face the crunch in the EECin 1966 when he is launching his attack on NATO. Whatever theultimate objective in de gaulle&apos;s e.c. policy, he will not accept any &quot; compromise&quot; which does not provide for a common agricultural policy on French terms, a drastic reduction of thepowers of the Commission, and agreement to eliminate majorityvoting. The effect would be permanent French veto on all aspectsof the Community&apos;s life, including its relations with other countries and its policy towards the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)and the Kennedy Round.9. The consequences for British interests of French policy inthis field, if it is successfully pursued and if no British actiondirected to thwart it is taken, would be that at the very least theprospect of European co-operation in economic and trade matterswill be greatly diminished. More serious still will be the political effect of France&apos;s challenge to the ideal of European unity. this could well lead to^a sense of malaise and division in western europe and a general loss of self-confidence and cohesion. probably the most dangerous possibility for our interests is that, in order to preserve somehow the form of the Treaty of Rome, the Five maybe prepared to acquiesce in the treaty being further modified or6511
interpreted to suit French interests, which in most of the relevantquestions are the opposite of our own. The result of this lattercontingency, taken with the permanent French veto on new members, would be in effect to exclude Britain while de Gaulleremained in power from what would become an entirelyFrench-dominated Community and probably also to encouragedangerous tendencies in Germany (see paragraphs 13 and 14 below).Economic10. De gaulle&apos;s economic policies will remain to our disadvantage over the next two years. Above all, it is very doubtfulwhether he cares whether or not the Kennedy Round succeeds; and unless the remaining countries of the e.c. who are in favour ofits successful completion are prepared to press him hard on this issue and the signs so far are not very encouraging de Gaullecan stop it succeeding. The failure of the Kennedy Round mightwell undermine the existence of the GATT and of the &quot; most favoured nation &quot; principle, which have formed the cornerstone ofour commercial policy for the last 20 years.11. De Gaulle has succeeded through the Yaounde convention in extending the preferential trading system which linked Franceand her former dependent territories to the e.c. as a whole,although it works much more in favour of France than of herpartners. This system is illiberal, in contrast to the sterling area,and constitutes a serious obstacle to the introduction of a generalisedsystem of preferences for the developing countries at large.12. In the monetary field de gaulle&apos;s determination to buildup French gold reserves and to restore the independence of the franc have led him not only to reject explicitly the presentfoundations of international liquidity, but also to block progress towards establishing any alternative system which would meet therequirements for increased liquidity, not only of the United kingdom but of the developing countries as well. He is therefore unlikely totake part in any exercise to support sterling. In so far as his attitudecauses sterling holders to feel that the currency may be devalued,it is a potential menace to our balance of payments position.Germany13. The General seems to have abandoned his hopes ofharnessing Germany to French ambitions. For the last two yearshe has made no effort to woo German opinion. He has in fact madea number of strongly anti-German remarks in private to thosewho are likely to pass them on. But he may still hope in the longrun to persuade the Germans that their only hope of reunificationlies in severing their close defence ties with the United States,abandoning any nuclear sharing arrangements in NATO andrelying primarily on French nuclear power for nuclear protection.De Gaulle can blackmail West Germany by threatening to recognise the East German regime. These proceedings bewilder and worry theGermans who had valued the previous French policy ofFranco-German reconciliation.
14. The consequences for Western Europe and for theWestern world as a whole of the GeneraFs increasingly anti-german attitude may be serious. The main danger is that, by blocking thenatural German aspiration to have a generally equal status withinthe Western Alliance, the General gives indirect encouragement toultra-nationalist tendencies in Germany. Not only does he thusharm the Franco-German rapprochement which has been one ofthe most encouraging features of post-war Western Europe, but hegives the impression of wanting to keep Germany in a state ofpermanent inferiority. The resulting frustration in Germany couldwell lead to the most undesirable evolution of German politicalthought and might end by destroying all the progress made since1945 of containing German ambitions within the Western defence,political and economic systems.Nuclear sharing and disarmament15. General de Gaulle will remain opposed to the idea of anynuclear power sharing its nuclear weapons with anyone. Inparticular, he will oppose nuclear sharing (even of a non-disseminatory nature) within the Western Alliance.16. There is little prospect of France agreeing to sign anon-dissemination agreement. De Gaulle probably regards a widedissemination of nuclear weapons as inevitable sooner or later. Hewould argue that the conclusion of a non-dissemination agreement would be of no value, since nothing affecting the peace of theworld could be done except by agreement of the Five nuclearPowers, including China.17. The French attitude towards disarmament questions is alsonegative and they have failed to take the seat reserved for them inthe Eighteen-Nation Disarmament Committee at Geneva. Frenchnuclear tests in the atmosphere due to be held from the middle of1966 onwards are likely to attract widespread internationalcondemnation. They might produce fall-out at levels which couldthreaten the safety of the Pitcairn islanders.18. On all these related questions the French attitude is different from, and to a large extent opposed to, our own. This islikely to continue to be so.Soviet Union19. It is unlikely that General de Gaulle will want to carryhis current rapprochement with the Soviet Union beyond a certainpoint. But it does seem likely that he will continue to promote an increasing convergence of French and Soviet positions over a variety of questions, particularly European questions; and de Gaulle andthe Russians may be prepared to enshrine this convergence of view in a new Franco-Soviet treaty. An obvious example of thisconvergence is that both the Soviet Union and France appear to wish that Germany should remain divided and that France and russia are at one (if for different reasons) in wanting to obstructany arrangement for &quot; nuclear sharing &quot;. Most important of all,
France and Russia both want to see the reduction or removal ofthe United States military presence in Europe, the break-up of theintegrated Western Alliance in its present form, and the preventionof moves to strengthen the political and economic unity of theWestern world. This convergence of policy also occurs at theUnited Nations and in the field of space and telecommunications.Other situations can be expected to arise, for instance in Indo-China,in which French and Soviet policies will both be designed in part to secure the removal of United States influence.20. An underlying French calculation seems to be that if theUnited States presence can be greatly reduced in Europe, Francewill be able to play a dominant role in European affairs in association with the Soviet Union. France&apos;s role will, of course, be far less important whenever the United States and the USSR are working together to settle major international problems. TheRussians for their part probably treat de Gaulle with somescepticism; he cannot affect the balance of real power in the world;his views on Communism as a transient ideology and the notion ofchopping the Soviet Union in half at the Urals can scarcely endearhim to Moscow. But the Russians no doubt reckon he can be usedto their advantage.21. If the General&apos;s policy is as outlined above, the maindanger to our own interests is that it is designed to cause confusion and division within the Western Alliance and is operating against any fundamental improvement in East-West relations. Both in thedefence field and in the field of foreign policy the General is in factworking on lines which are the opposite to our own.China22. General de Gaulle seems so far to have got less out ofhis China policy than he hoped. But there are parallels betweenthe French and the Chinese positions in the world which he will go on trying to exploit to extend France&apos;s influence, particularlyin the Third World. By helping to bring China on to the centre ofthe world stage where, de Gaulle can claim, she properly belongs he hopes to increase the leverage which France can exert both onthe United States and the Soviet Union; to weaken the &quot; doublehegemony &quot; of those two countries; to bring another Great Powerinto the forum of the United Nations; and to gain a powerful allyon a variety of international issues, e.g., the Test Ban Treaty, whereFrance is at present isolated. In the short term, China&apos;s absence from the negotiating table can be used by the General as a convenient pretext for his refusal to fall in with a number of UnitedStates ideas, e.g., in the disarmament field, to which he objects.British role23. General de Gaulle has always found it difficult to fit theBritish into his scheme of things. His attitude to us is a mixture ofadmiration, resentment and contempt. We have no place, as equals,in his concept of Europe, although he hopes to make tactical use of us as a convenient makeweight against supranational ideas. He may
hope one day, as he has put it, to &quot; have us naked &quot;, so that britain has no alternative but to follow France in a Europe she willdominate. Whether his true purpose is as extreme as this or not, hewill certainly aim to develop to the utmost a Franco-Britishtechnical partnership, which will give France the know-how she must have if she is to enjoy any substantial technologicalindependence of the United States over the next few years.De Gaulle would also not be sorry if the development of anglo-French collaboration were to impair our relationship withthe United States and impede our technical (and political)co-operation with other European countries. We shall have to watch the developing situation very closely in order to judge where ourown interest lies and how we can best promote it over any givenproject or series of projects.Conclusion24. The inescapable conclusion is that in European questionsGeneral de Gaulle&apos;s policies are likely to be harmful to Britishinterests, even though in particular cases he may seek, or appear to seek, collaboration with us. The timing of his moves cannot beforetold partly because it must depend on the reactions of others.He may increasingly become an old man in a hurry, especially if his health deteriorates, and a determination to change the Europeanscene in some marked way before he leaves it is likely to influence the timing of his actions. He is most unlikely to modify hisfundamental aims in order to meet internal criticism.25. How much of the policy outlined in this paper general de Gaulle will be able to carry out depends on factors which he cannot entirely control. Up to now, he has been able to exploitto the full a French power of veto, exercised as a member ofinternational organisations, principally NATO and the e.c.. To theextent that he withdraws France from effective membership of these bodies, so will he forgo this ability. France&apos;s isolation will become increasingly obvious, as will the essentially negative aims of Gaullistpolicy. It will also become increasingly apparent to Frenchmen, as( well as to those with whom he is dealing, that General de Gaulledoes not have the capacity to shape the world as he would like it;that he is pursuing a policy which in many respects is beyondFrance&apos;s natural strength. Following his relatively poor showing inthe presidential election, what he says and does could well becomesubject to the law of diminishing returns, particularly with the approach of the general elections in April 1967, after which he cannot be at all certain of commanding a parliamentary majority.Above all, the damage General de Gaulle can cause to the western world can be limited by the reactions of the other members of it.26. We, for our part, will have to defend ourselves asvigorously as we can in every way open to us. We should avoidprovocative tactics which would only allow General de Gaulle to blame us for the divisions which he himself will have brought about.We must remember that in the long run the French are natural if
difficult allies. But I am afraid that we must face the fact that weare for the present dealing with a regime under the control of aman whose attitude and intentions are in most cases hostile to ourown. We must not allow ourselves to be used by the General insuch a way as to harm our own real interests and those of theWestern world as a whole. Our fundamental policy must be toprevent or limit the damage which France can do to the cohesionof the Western world, while keeping a chair for France against theday when she will, so I hope, be willing to resume co-operation with us and our allies.M.
