I,; DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C(66) 9 COPY NO. _5loth January. 1966CABINETHARDSHIP CLAIM BY THE BRITISH AIRCRAFT CORPORATIONFOLLOWING THE CANCELL ORATION OF THE TSR. 2Memorandum by the -Minister of aviation the TSR, 2 contracts contained the following standard conditionj-&quot;(4)   If in any particular case hardship to the contractor should arise from the operation of this Condition  viz, the Breakclause permitting HMG to cancel the contract at three months&apos;notice7 it shall be open to the contractor to refer the circum-stances to the Authority /Vis. the Ministry/ who, on being satisfied that ouch hardship exists, shall make such allowance,if any, as in his opinion is reasonable, and the decision ofthe Authority on any matter or thing arising out of this Clauseshall be final and conclusive. &quot;2.      When v/e decided to cancel the TSR. 2, it was predictable that theBritish Aircraft Corporation (BAG) would submit a claim for asubstantial payment under this clause.    The TSR, 2 cancellation was quite different from that of the HS, 601 and P. 1154.    These projects were atan early stage, whereas the TSR, 2 was at an advanced stage of develop-rnent, and moreover constituted a major factor in the formation of theCorporation in I960.    Without this project the Corporation would almost certainly not have taken its present form.    Its cancellation robbed BAGof the basic work and profit on which all its future plans had been based,and v/e always recognised that a heavy hardship claim would be made bycontractors.    My colleagues will recall that in the calculations whichwere made at the time of cancellation, this was put at a notional figureof  20 million (Appendix to OPD(65) 14, paragraph 2),3,      The chief constituents of BACs plans had been the Concord-supersonic airliner and the BACol-11.    The Concord was being financedlargely (and is now financed wholly) from public funds, but the major part of the 1-11 development was being funded by the Corporation.    all their plans for the 1-11 were based on the expection that the TSR, 2 would continue to completion, giving them several years further development work and a reasonably profitable production contract, absorbing a shareof their overheads, and providing a financial cushion against any setbacksin the 1-11 programme,    1  the TSR. 2 had gone into service on the basisof 100 aircraft, BAG could have expected total profits of the order of 40 million (excluding possible follow-on orders, spares, etc. )0    the cancellation of the TSR, 2 not only frustrated these expectations; it also threw sufficient doubt on the future of the Corporation to affectadversely the sales prospects of the BAG, 1-11 itself,-1-
4, It is not surprising that in these circumstances the Corporationhas submitted a claim for financial assistance on a large scale. this claim falls into three parts(a) A claim for  8.5 million under the &quot;hardship&quot; provision of the break Clause of the TSR.2 contracts, this sum representingthe difference between the profits which BAG expected to earnhad fee contracts actually placed (broadly for development and pro--production batches) been completed and the profits it willhave earned on work done on them up to termination.(b) A request for a payment of  19.25 million in respect of the costof the development of the BAG, 1-11 200 series (the firstversion of the aircraft, towards which a Government contributionhas already been made - see paragraph 10 below), die 300/400series (now under development) and the 500 series (not yetstarted) - any payment under this heading to bo reduced by theamount paid under (a) above,(c) A claim for  9.452 million for overheads unrecoverable as aresult of the cancellation of the TSR, 2 contracts.5.       The claim at 4(c) is made under mat paragraph of the Break Clausewhich gives a contractor an indemnity against expenditure which he wouldhave been able to charge against the contract, had it not been cancelled, sofar as that expenditure is unavoidable and so far as it represents a loss.The quantum of this claim can be negotiated in accordance with normalcontractual practice.    It is probable that only a much smaller sum thanthat claimed will be admissible, and the Corporation have already argued that the balance should be treated as a hardship claim under the clausequoted in paragraph 1 above, additional to the claim at 4(a),6.       The hardship claim at 4(a) must not be confused with the normalcancellation charges.   these are strictly related to work done, andexpenditure and commitments actually incurred, by the contractor on contracts placed with him up to the time of termination.    The TSR, 2contracts actually placed were of a limited nature and covered only partof the future development and production.    The hardship claim is for thebalance of the profit which the firm think they would have earned had the contracts as placed been completed.    It does not include any element forprofit on the further contracts which would have been placed had the projectQpt been cancelled.    It is peculiarly difficult to deal with.   The clause doeonot provide for arbitration, although the version used up to 1959 did;  andthere is no precedent for any substantial hardship payment on any othex*contract.    It raisec two questions - wao there any hardship? - and, if so,how can it be quantified ?7,      Nor can the, claim at 4(a) be considered in isolation from that at(b),    In one sense what BAG are saying is that they want a total paymentof  19ol5 million, plus the amount claimed at 4(c), to put them in a financial position sound enough to absorb the adverse effects of the TSR, 2decision and enable them to continue with the BAG. 1-11 programme.    Sostrongly have they emphasised this approach that my Director ofAccountancy Services ha a investigated their finances.    His report revealsthat these are indeed precarious and that they certainly need an injectionof money to enable them to carry on effectively.    He assesses the sum required at a minimum of  12 million.    Treasury officials have had acopy of his report.
HI PIHPKITIHkl858.       The future cf 3AC is important to us because they areresponsible for our share of the Concord airframe development and of thetwo Anglo-French military projects.    But the fact that they are in financial difficulties does not in itself add up to a justification of a largehardship payment.    Nor, I am sure, should we contemplate a paymentdesigned primarily to compensate them for the frustration of theirexpectation of profit on the uncompleted part of the contracts.9.      Having said that, however, I cannot escape the conclusion thatthe difficulty which they are certainly experiencing in financing the3AC. 1-11 is due largely to the TSR, 2 cancellation, and that if the clausequoted in paragraph 1 means anything, this must be regarded as a hardshiparising from the cancellation.    Ji this conclusion be accepted, we are left with the more difficult task of deciding at what sum to assess the degreeof hardship.    Any ouch assessment must inevitably be to a large extentarbitrary.    It should neither be related to loss of profit, nor to the sumneeded to put the Corporation on its feet.    But I think it could reasonably be assessed on the following basis.10.      The first version of the BAG. 1-11 (the 200 series) was estimated by BAG to cost  19. 5 million to develop.    In 1962 they applied for the50 per cent aid which present policy allowed us to contribute towards a promising civil aircraft and were granted it.    In the event the actual costof development substantially exceeded  19.5 million but our contributionhas been limited to  9.75 million, half the original estimate.   Thedifference represents the sort of commitment the Corporation would have expected to finance from their TSR. 2 profits - had these been available.11.       &quot;/Then BAG decided in 1963 to go ahead with the second version ofthe aircraft, the 300/400 series, it was open to them to apply for similar50 per cent Government assistance.    Had they done so, they wouldprobably have got it.   But they did not apply.    They preferred to financeit themselves, partly no doubt because at that time it promised to attractmore orders than have in fact materialised, but also partly in the expectation that their profits on the TSR, 2 would provide a. financialcushion against any setbacks.    This expectation has been frustrated.There is no doubt that had they anticipated cancellation of the TSR. 2 theywould have applied for (and almost certainly received) assistance towardsthe BAG. 1-11 300/400 series.    Indeed, in November, 1964 (when rumourswere circulating that the ToR.2 might be cancelled) BAG applied forretrospective launching aid on the 300/400 series.    This was refused,but the Corporation were told that they could raise the matter again ifthey sustained a major blow such as the cancellation of the TSR,, 2.    Inthe circumstances I feel that they have a strong claim to such assistance.12.      The total estimated cost of developing the BAG, 1-11 200/300/400series is now put at  36 million.    This figure will require further discussion with BAG before we can accept it but it is broadly accurate as representing the actual cost of developing the 200 series a.nd theestimated cost of completing the 300/400 series.    They have already received  9. 75 million towards the 200 series and my view is that weshould now pay them a further sum to bring our total contribution tip to50 per cent of the agreed coot cf the project to date and the estimatedforward cost.    E this is confirmed as  36 million our additionalpayment would be a further  8,25 million.
13.     Although this is a large sum, in fact it breaches in only tworespects the principles and policy on which our programme of assistanceto civil aircraft development is based.    In the first place we shouldexceptionally be paying half the actual cost of developing the 200 seriesinstead of half the cost estimated in advance;   of course had theCorporation correctly forecast the higher cost, they would probably havereceived a larger contribution initially.    In the second place, we shouldbe approving assistance to the 300/400 series after the development hasbeen started (and indeed nearly completed) instead of in advance of thedecision by the Corporation to embark on ouch development.    But here the Corporation would certainly have applied for such assistance had they not been relying on the TSR. 2.    These two exceptions to the normalrules are, in my view, justified by the circumstances.    And I must pointout that the other side of the medal is that the Corporation will be quick to argue that our offer, substantial though it is, involves no payment whichthey could not have obtained in a.ny case had their estimate of the cost ofthe 200 series been more accurate and had they applied in the normal v/ayfor assista.nce towards the 300/400 series.14.     There remains the development of the BAG. 1-11 500 series whichis included in the Corporation^ claim at 4(b) but on which no decision has yet been ta.ken to proceed.    The estimated cost of this development is 6 million, the whole of which the Corporation are seeking from theGovernment by way of assistamce.    This ca.n be left out of our concidera-tion at the present stage.    The project can be examined and processed inthe normal way and if my Department feels that there is a. strong case forthe normal assistance, it will be submitted to the Treasury.    But I do not regard it as very likely that a decision to go ahead with the 500 series willbe taken.15.     Having come to the conclusion that such a payment cf  0.25 milliontowards the BAG. 1-11 would be justified, my predecessor sought theChancellor1 s approval to itc    The Ch.ancellor felt unable to give this,however, on two main grounds.    The first was that he questioned whether any such payment, representing, as it did, a payment in respect offrustrated TSR. 2 profits (however much the amount might be based on, and represented as, aid to the BAG. 1-11), could be justified when theCorporation were alreakly being fully paid for all work actually done on theTSR. 2.    Secondly he considered that to snake such a payment now, at atime when, following Plowden, we might be about to embark on negotiationsdesigned to acquire a Government shareholding in the Corporation, wouldbe politically indefensible as being likely to raise the cost of acquiring sucha shareholding.    If any TSR. 2 claim was to be admitted, the Chancellorconsidered that this should be included a,t the time of any evaluation of theCorporation for the purpose of agreeing a price for its shares.    TheChancellor agreed, however, that if BAG could establish a case for aGovernment loan to tide them over their immediate difficulties, thepossibility of such a lean should be discussed with them,1-6;     I know that my predecescor was - as I am - unhappy at thisdecision.    He pointed out that the Corporation would certainly representit (and indeed regard it) as a refusal to accord them&apos; any justice in respectof the appalling blow of the TSR. 2 cancellation, and a deliberate devicefor depressing the value of their assets for the purpose of valuationpreceding any Government purchase of shares.   He said that the decisions would, in his view, make it unlikely that post-Plowden discussions with theCorporation would get very far on a freely negotiated basis,-4-CONF8DENTIAL
17,     The decision was conveyed to the Chairman of BAG on20th December, 1965,    His reaction was explosive and was not modified by the offer to discuss a Government loan.    He regarded the decision asa rejection of any claim in respect of &quot;hardship&quot; following the TOR. 2cancellation, and wholly refused to accept the argument that the effect ofthe TSR. 2 cancellation should be taken into account in any post-Plowdenevaluation of the Corporation,    He made the point that no accountant couldbe asked to do this.    It would still be for. the Government to decide whatallowance should be made on this account.    They could not shuffle off this responsibility eventually, and should face up to it now.    Following ameeting of the BAG Board on 21st December, 1965 the Chairman wrote to my Permanent Secretary a letter which I attach as an Annex to this paper.18.     It will be seen that this letter takes the line that the rejection ofthe TSR. 2 claim makes free and voluntary negotiations between theGovernment and BAG on the basis of the Flowden recommendationsimpossible.    Since it was written I have had two meetings with LordPortal and Sir George Edwards.    They have been adamant in theirinsistence that they will not discuss the Plowden recommendation on aGovernment shareholding orporation until their claim issatisfactorily settled.    Their attitude leaves me no alternative but tobring this matter to the attention of the Cabinet in advance of the paper on .the Plowden Report generally which will be circulated later in the month.19.     If v/e decide to reject the Corporation^ TSR. 2 hardship claim, wemust do so in recognition of the possible consequences - although these will not be precisely known until the Corporation come to accept thedecision as final.    Apart from the publicity which the Corporation willinvoke, with the inevitable allegations of injustice and discrimination, themain action which BAG have threatened-eatened is a drastic curtailment of their activities, including the cessation of BAG. 1-11 production.    I am not convinced that they will carry out this latter threat.    The development ofthe BAG. 1-11 300/400 series has been almost fully paid for, and it wouldbe a little surprising if BAG decided to cease production and thus give upall hope of getting their money back.    But it is a possibility.20.     My own views coincide with those of my predecessor,    I,think thatin the exceptional circumstances the Corporation has a supportable hardshipclaim and that the proposal to base this on &apos;ex post facto&apos; launching aid forthe BAG. 1-11 is a sensible one.    To approve action on these lines at thisstage v/ould rid us of a bone of bitter contention which cannot fail topoison our future relations with the Corporation, whatever these may be.It would, of course, be made clear to BAG that the offer of a payment of 8,25 million on account of further assistance to the BAG. 1-11 must beregarded as sweeping up any &quot;hardship&quot; claim related to the TSR, 2including any hardship element of the claim at 4(c), and the corporation have already accepted this.    I should add that of the arbitrary sum of 20 million in respect of hardship which we inserted into the calculationswhen considering the cancellation of TSR. 2,   12 million would representBACs proportionate and notional &quot;share&quot;.    A payment of the size nowproposed v/ould not therefore in any way invalidate the calculations whichwere before Ministers at the time the cancellation was decided or erodethe savings which were forecast to result from that cancellation.Re commendation21.     I recommend, therefore, that my colleagues should approve asettlement of BACs TSR. 2 hardship claim on the lines set out inparagraphs 9 to 13 of this paper.F.W. M.Ministry of Aviation, S.
