Since the proposals involve changes of a budgetary naturewhich come into effect on 17th January, and because of thepossibility of forestalling, it is essential to preserve the strictestsecrecy about the contents of the White Paper until 3. 30 p. m. onM onday.2.      For the benefit of Ministers who have not been concerned withthe preparation of the scheme, I attach a copy of the official Pressrelease which summarises the principal features of the scheme andthe reasons for its introduction.     The Board of Trade are to beresponsible for administering the new scheme of investment grants.ip t TBoard of Trade, S. W. 1.14th January, 1966
DRAFT PRESS RELEASE6SINVESTMENT INCENTIVESRadical changes in the system of investment incentives forkey sectors of the British economy are announced in a White Paperpublished today.    Under the new system, which requires legislation,existing initial and investment allowances will be replaced by cashgrants of 20% of the cost of plant and machinery in manufacturing and extractive industries, with a higher rate of grant of 40% inwider Development Areas, which will replace the existing develop-ment districts.    These new arrangements are part of the Government1sdrive to speed up the modernisation of British industry.2.     The main way in which Governments have influenced investment in the past is by the use of initial and investment allowances.Initial allowances permit firms to write off part of the cost oftheir new machinery in the first year and so accelerate the annual&quot;wear and tear&quot; allowances.    Investment allowances give tax reliefover and above the full value of the asset and so are equivalentto a grant to those firms which pay enough tax to take advantageof them.3.     One important disadvantage of investment allowances is that itis difficult to translate them into an immediate cash benefit. their value depends on the future profit position of the firm and futurerates of taxation.    And the extra benefit of investmentallowances accrues only gradually as depreciation allowances are used up.    Surveys have shown that many business men, at the timewhen they are deciding whether to make an investment, do not makeproper allowances for the effect on their future tax bill ofparticular purchases of machinery.    Cash payments will give morecertainty.    They will be given irrespective of a firm&apos;s profit ortax position and are bound to be treated as a deduction from thecost of investment.    They will be given initially within abouteighteen months (and ultimately six months) of the time when the firm pays for the plant and machinery.   When the scheme is in full operation, therefore,  the new grants will be received much soonerthan investment allowances and from the outset they will be boundto influence investment decisions far more certainly than theexisting system.4.     The scheme is deliberately intended to concentrate incentiveson these sectors of the economy in which investment is most urgently needed.    In the past an insufficient proportion of thenation1s savings has been invested in manufacturing industry to achieve the necessary rate of economic growth.    Increased invest-ment and productivity in this sector of industry is also vitalfor the balance of payments.    Other sectors which will benefit from the new arrangements have been selected because of the con-tribution that they make, either by helping exports or savingimports, to the balance of payments.    The extractive industries and ships will be eligible for the new grants.    Separate arrange-ments will be made for agriculture, and fishing vessels.5.     All investment allowances are discontinued with effect from midnight on Sunday,  16th January, 1966.    Free depreciation in development districts is also discontinued from the same date.6.      Investment in new plant and machinery (apart from certainexcluded items) in the manufacturing and extractive industriesoutside the Development Areas from today will be eligible for a cash grant of 20%.    This will replace the present 30% investmentallowance and the 10% initial allowance.    Among the excludeditems will be vehicles, office equipment,  loose tools and other small items.    The main activities of nationalised industries willalso be excluded, but certain ancillary manufacturing activitieswill be eligible.
7.      Special arrangements will apply to ships and computers.    ships will qualify for the 20% investment grant and the special arrange-ment of free depreciation for ships introduced last year willcontinue.    A 20% grant will be available for computers used for allcommercial and industrial purposes.    The rate of grant for ships and computers will be 20% throughout Great Britain and will not beaffected by the differential rate of grant for Development Areas.8.      The existing initial allowances for vehicles and aircraft,which will not qualify for investment grants, will be raised to30%.    For industries other than manufacturing and extraction, forthe main activities of nationalised industries, and for anyexcluded items including those mentioned in paragraph 6, the initial allowance on plant and machinery will be increased from10% to 30%.    Industrial buildings will get a 15% initial allowance.These changes in tax allowances also take effect from midnight on16th January,  1966.9.      The new grants will apply to payments made by firms on or after 17th January,  1966.    The intention is that when the schemeis in full operation grants will be paid about six months afterclaims are made.    To do this straightaway would impose too heavy a burden on the Exchequer, because of the outstanding cost of investment allowances arising from past investment.    Initially thenew grants will be paid about eighteen months after the expenditure by firms, but this period will be subsequently reduced.    This willbe done as the economic situation permits, bearing in mind that the acceleration of payments will involve additional cost to theExchequer at that stage.10.    In the new Development Areas the rate of grant for plant and machinery in the manufacturing and extractive industries will be40%, compared with the national rate of 20%.    This will not applyto certain types of mobile equipment used in these industries nor to ships and computers, which will receive the national rate of grant, wherever located.11.    The development districts under the Local Employment Acts willbe replaced by new and wider Development Areas.    The changes are shown on the attached map.    The Development Areas will cover thewhole of Scotland, except the Edinburgh area, and the whole of wales except parts along the north coast and around Cardiff.    InEngland, the whole of the Northern Region and the Furness peninsulawill be covered;    in the North West, St. Helens and the Warral willbe added to the existing development district of.Merseyside;    inthe South West, almost the whole of.Cornwall and North Devon willbe a Development Area.    Unlike the development districts, whoseselection depends solely on the level of actual and prospectiveunemployment, the new development areas are chosen with referenceto ,the Government1 s wider regional policies and take account ofall relevant economic circumstances.12.    With effect from today,  the new 40% grants will replace the10% grants for plant and machinery which have been paid to firms in development districts under the Local Employment Acts since1963, but will not be limited to projects providing employment.Free depreciation in development districts will be discontinued.The Board of Trade will continue to consider applications for grants of 10% under the Local Employment Acts which they havealready received.13.    The other forms of assistance at present available under the&apos;Local Employment Acts will continue for projects providing employment and will apply to the new Development Areas after thenecessary legislation has been passed.    These are building grantsat 25%, tailor-made loans and grants and the provision of Board of
Trade    factories.    The Board of Trade will have new powers togive additional assistance to firms setting up new units in development Areas.14.    The Northern Ireland Government are making a separateannouncement about improvements in the special schemes for grants to industry in Northern Ireland.15.    Legislation will be introduced in the current Session to giveeffect to all these proposals.    The arrangements for submittingclaims will be announced later in the year.
