DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY JS GOVERNMENT)C(66) 492nd March, 1966Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster the Farm Price Review Committee this morning discusseda memorandum by the Agricultural Ministers which is attached as an annex to this paper.    The Agricultural Ministers now believe that thereis a very good chance of achieving an agreed settlement with the FarmersUnions on the basis of an increase in the guarantees of about  28 millioncompared with the limit set by the Cabinet at its discussion on&quot;8th February (CG(66) 6th Conclusions, Minute 1) of  20 million.    It willbe necessary to increase the price of milk, beef and cereals beyond thefigures contemplated in a settlement at  20 million.    The agricultural ministers do not believe that there is any chance of a settlement at a figure of significantly less than  28 million since the Farmers&apos; Unionswill have difficulty in accepting any settlement which does not fullyrecoup their additional costs of about  32 million.2.      The discussions with the Farmers1 Unions have not thrown up any new factors affecting the merits of a settlement on the basis of 20 million v/hich were not put before Cabinet in my memorandum c(66) 28, and in the Cabinet discussion of that paper on 8th February.The only new factor is that the chances of reaching an agreed settlement with the Farmers&apos; Unions at about  28 million are believed to be betterthan might have been thought before the discussions started.     The only question, therefore, is whether it is worth offering a more generoussettlement in order to reach an agreement with the farmers v/hich v/ouldenable the agricultural expansion programme envisaged in the national economic Plan to be started in an atmosphere of co-operation.3.     Any agreed settlement would have to involve an incree.se of morethan Id a gallon in the price of milkj    At the Cabinet meeting on 8th February it was agreed that further consideration should be given tomilk prices.    The position is as follows.    The present retail price of milk is 9fd a pint and this will not be reduced during the summer months.The retail price v/ill have to be raised to lOd some time in the autumn of1966.    If the farmers&apos; price is raised by l^d a gallon rather them Id then the retail price will have to be raised to lOd a pint two months ea.rlier.Of the additional payments for milk to the farmer about four-fifths willbe met by consumers and one-fifth will fall on the Exchequer throughthe welfare milk scheme.    The effect on the cost of living index of anincrease of gd a pint is o. 13 points on the Total Index.COPY NO.66CABINETFARM PRICE REVIEW
4.     Some increase in the profitability of cereals will also need to beincluded in an agreed settlement.    Some concern was expressed in the farm Price Review Committee that this would lead to the terminationby our overseas suppliers of the present bilateral minimum priceschemes with them.    The Agricultural Ministers, however, believethat we should be able to defend our action and that the agreements would not be terminated.conclusion.     I ask my colleagues to decide whether the Agricultural   &apos; &apos;Ministers should be authorised to offer an increase of  28 million inthe  guarantees to the Farmers5 Unions as the basis of an agreed settlement^ or whether they should stick to a maximum increase of 20 million on which, as was made clear on 8th February, no agreed settlement is possible.    The Farm Price Review Committee can see1no prospect of an agreed settlement on a figure less than  28 million.D. H.70, Whitehall, S. W. 1.2nd March, 1966-2-
ANNEXFARM   PRICE,   REVIEW   DISCUSSIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Joint parliamentary under Secretary of State, Home OfficeIntroduction1.     We wish to report to our colleagues the present stage reached in the farm price review discussions.The Farmers&apos; Case2.     The farmers have pressed their case very strongly and haverelied in their arguments on the need for them to have the toolsto do their job under the Plan.    They have argued that for thispurpose the extra short-term and long-term investment per annumrequired will be about  150 to  180 million, a major part of whichwill have to be found from farm income.    Against this background the farmers have asked for about  50 million, but will clearly beprepared to come below this figure.    We on the other hand have gone up to nearly  20 million as authorised.    If the negotiations breakdown at this point, there will not only be no agreed settlement,but also great bitterness and angry disillusion will be caused.The row will be far wcrse than last year because of the expeCiar-tions aroused by the selective expansion programme, and theGovernment&apos;s expressed recognition of the industry&apos;s need to havethe physical and financial resources required to carry It out.This disillusion may well be shared by the agricultural workers.The Overall Settlement &quot; y3.      The farmers&apos; leaders sincerely want an agreed settlementprovided it is one which they think that they can defend.    while they will probably come down considerably from their present figure of about  50 million, they will he very reluctant to comebelow about  32 million, which is the figure of cost increases thisyear.    A settlement at this level would permit farmers to retain the benefits of their rising productivity for reinvestment, andsome increase in their standard of living.    It is possible&apos;that under great pressure they might come down to a little below 30 million provided they are given long-term assurances on beef and milk,  h4.      We believe that economically and politically an agreed settlement is desirable if it could be obtained at an overa.llfigure of a little less than  30 million - say  28 million.    f\ewant the,,co-operation of the farmers on the Plan, particularly in getting it launched this year.   Under- this agriculture has beengiven a very considerable job of import saving to do, and if we wish this to he achieved, we must provide the industry with enoughmoney to he able to finance the expansion.    We also want theco-operation of the farmers on our longer term agricultural policies1 .
which are embodied in the Agriculture Bill which has been going through the House.    The alternative of bitterness and angrydisillusion is bound to have considerable repercussions.    We donot think that it would be sensible to invite this if it can reasonably be avoided.5.    &quot;Any agreed settlement must of course be politicallydefensible by the Government.    We think that one at say  28 million would be wholly defensible bearing in mind that this figure has,in addition to providing personal income, got to cover the interest on the considerable extra investment that farmers have got to make to secure the objectives of the Plan.    If allowance were made foran 8 per cent return (the approximate rate at which short-term capital is borrowed) on the increased investment of about  150 to 180 million next year, this would account for about  13 millionout of such an award, leaving  15 million as a true comparison withsalaries and wages.    This represents an increase of about 3tr pe^cent, which would be fully consistent with the prices and incomes policy.Commodities6.     Any agreed settlement would only he possible if, within the overall total, we are prepared to give a bit more on cattle, milk,and cereals.    We should have to go to 10/- per cwt. on cattle(an extra  2-g- million), and to 1-J-d.  (or possibly llrd,) per gallon,on milk (an extra  2-f- to  4-g- million) , and to give some form of   &apos;long term assurance on both commodities.    On cereals we shouldhave to give a small increase in profitability of-about 3l?d. percwt. on wheat and on barley (en extra  3 million), and to provideabout another  1-^ million on other commodities.    To bring thetotal back to about  28 million we should have to make extra cuts of about  3-g- million elsewhere, possibly by bigger cuts on limeand ploughing grants.    Further details about commodities are givenin. the Appendix.7.     The extra amounts of money proposed for cattle and milk(together with the long-term assurances), are in our view defensiblein view of the extra beef production that v/e want from home sources.The extra small amount on cereals is less defensible, but v/e think ;that it would not be an unreasonable thing to do as part of an agreed overall settlement.    Such an award would mean continuing the increased price of milk to the consumer for a further one ortwo months during the year, and would increase the potentialExchequer liability by another  5 or  6 million.Re c omme ndat i on8. .   In the light of all the circumstances we would recommend toour colleagues that the Cabinet should be invited to revise itsprevious conclusions and authorise us to go up to  28 million,provided that this would secure an agreed settlement.    In puttingthis proposition to the farmers we would make it clear that in theevent of agreement not being reached, the offer of tho additionalmoney would be withdrawn and we would stick to the figure ofapproximately  20 million.\ i2.
9.     We very much hope that our colleagues will agree that sucha recommendation can row ho put forward by this Committee tothe Cabinet.W.R.T.F.P.T.G.T.linistry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food,London, S.W.1.1st March, 1966
COMMODITIES1.     The farmers have been remarkably modest in their requests oncattle and milk compared with what we expected.    They have askedfor 14/- per cwt. for cattle, and 1-fd per gallon for milk, but,since beef production is a long-term business, they also wantlonger term assurances.    If they get satisfactory ones, theycould possibly be persuaded to come down to 10/- per cwt. forcattle and 1-J-d. to 1-g-d per gallon for milk.    The Cabinet havealready authorised 8/- on cattle, so that this would mean 2/-more,  or approximately an extra  2%- million.    In the case of milkthe Cabinet have authorised 1d per gallon, and an extra -j-d to -g-dwould-mean another  21- to  4-1 million or, in terms of the retail price, -g-d on the pint for one or two extra months.2.     The longer term assurance which the farmers want for cattleis that the price will not, during the next three years, be dropped below this year1s level.   We have already given such an assurance in relation to the present price, and we do not thinkthat it would be unreasonable to extend it as proposed by the farmers so that it applies to the price as increased this year.It is unlikely that it will cost anything since world beef prices will almost certainly remain firm, and it is in any eventimprobable that we should want to decrease the prices during thenext three years.3.       For milk, the long term assurance they want is that if the dairy herd is increased so as to produce more beef, the consequential extra milk (most of which will go into butter and cheese which give a far lower return than sales for liquidconsumption) will not be allowed to penalise producers bydepressing the pool price.    They are, therefore, asking for aGovernment assurance that the milk fund will be financiallyreimbursed by one moans or another so as to cover the extra milkproduced (subject to a maximum annual figure) in the interests of beef production.    This could cost up to a maximum of another -g-dper gallon per year and would be really a payment for the extra beef that we want produced by the dairy herd.    We thinkthat against the background of the Plan, these long-term assurances are reasonable in principle.    The exact form of suchassurances needs more detailed consideration.4.      Cereals raises greater difficulties.    Here the farmers have asked for the restoration of the price cuts made last year.This would certainly put at risk our bilateral cereals agree-ments with the United States, Canada, Australia, and theArgentine, and could have damaging repercussions on the - prospects for the Kennedy Round.    But the farmers will certainly not agreeany settlement unless we are prepared to accept some increase inprofitability for wheat and barley.    Tho most that:wo think ispossible would be to make an increase in tho standard quantity cfsay 800,000 tons, without cutting back tho guaranteed prices incompensation.    This could give cereals growers an effectiveincrease of about 3&apos;ird per cwt.  on both wheat and barley (about 3 million in all), but the actual guaranteed prices would remain unchanged.    This would have to bo defended to our overseas suppliers by pointing to the proposed  cut  in the/ploughing
ploughing grant valued at about  3.7 million (or higher with a bigger cut), about three-quarters of which benefits cerealgrowers.   While there would be some risk to our bilateralcereals agreements, we believe that such a settlement would bedefensible, and that tho agreements would not be terminated.5.     As regards the other commodities , a small addition of another 2/6d per&apos;ton will be necessary on potatoes, costings afurther  600,000, as an insurance policy so as to try and reduce the shortage we are likely to have this year, and prevent retail prices rising too high.    There will also need to be a small award of about 2/- a ton on sugar beet, costinganother  700,000, to coyer the greatly increased costs duo tobad weather.i i
