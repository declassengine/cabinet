[3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTYJS GOVERNMENT)C(66) 243rd February, 1966COPYPY NO.CABINETSITING OF THE PROTOTYPE FAST REACTORMemorandum by the Minister of technology the Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed proposals I put tohim for the construction of a Prototype Fast Reactor (PFR) at a capital cost of about  29 million,    I am being pressed to announce where the prototype is to be built and this raises important political, economicand social issues.2.      The choice lies between Dounreay in Caithness and Winfrith inDorset.     Other sites have been considered, but rejected for the over-riding reason that the Atomic Energy Authority (ASA) already have tworeactor research and development establishments ana certainly do not need a third.    Although the Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (AGR)prototype is at Wind scale, this establishment is otherwise almostentirely concerned with the processing of burnt fuel elements.     TheAGR was put there in 195 8 because at that time work had only recentlybegun on the Winfrith site.3,      The choice between Dounreay and Winfrith depends onconsiderations which can be grouped as follows(i)    Long-term planning of the Authority&apos;s research anddevelopment programme.(ii)   Costs.(iii) Technical considerations affecting the fast reactordevelopment programme.(iv) Social and related questions.^&apos; -    Long-term planning of the AE A&apos;s programmeWhen the Authority was set up in 1954, its major task in thecivil field was to pursue the development of nuclear power.    Asubstantial part of this work has now been done.     We have a nuclear power programme based on Magnox reactors which has alreadydemonstrated the technical efficiency and safety of nuclear reactors asgenerators of electricity.     We have also authorised a secondprogramme, for the period 1970-75, in which nuclear power will bemore than competitive with conventional power stations.    Further work is needed to achieve the full development potential of the AGRj andthere is still considerable scope for further reduction of the costs of-1-
nuclear power and for the achievement of a balance programmebetween thermal and fast reactor stations.    It is clear, however,that there is bound to be a gradual decline in the scale of effort andexpenditure on the development of power reactor systems.    A taperedprogramme v/hich will reflect this is now being worked out.    Althoughthe details are not yet clear, it seems certain that such a programmecan be most efficiently and economically organised at one majorreactor development establishment rather than at two.    It would bewasteful to try to run both the existing establishments at substantially reduced levels of activity.5.      Bounreay is concerned almost entirely with fast reactordevelopment and has only one research reactor - for materialstesting - in addition to the experimental fast reactor.    &quot;Winfrith is involved in the development of all four of the Authroity&apos;s reactorsystems - AGR, Steam Generating Heavy Water Reactor (SGHW),High Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (the Dragon internationalproject) and the Fast Reactor.    The 100 MW prototype SGHW nowbeing built there is expected to have a long operating life.    TheDragon reactor, also on this site, is likely to function for a number ofyears, assuming that the United Kingdom or a group of countriesjointly, decide to go on with this type of reactor.    In addition, Winfrithhas five other small experimental and research reactors.i6*      EmploymentDounreay at present employes some 2,300 and, if the PFRwere to be built there, the establishments work would begin to declineafter 1971, when it came into operation.    The major work on fastreactor development would be completed within about fi^e years there -after; and the programme of work that could be foreseen for theestablishment in, say, 1976 would not amount to more than about halfthe present activity.    If Dounreay were not to have the PFR theestablishment would still be kept open for eight years or so from now,since it will be necessary to keep the present experimental fastreactor in operation for about that period; but the scientific work would taper off over the next few years.7.     In short, without PFR Dounreay would close about 1974.    with it, the establishment v/ould be reduced to not more than half itspresent size by 19*76.    After 1976, employment would be confined tothe operation of the PFR. as an electricity generating station, togetherwith certain connected development activities.    The total employment would amount to some 1,200, comprising 200 scientists and engineers and about 1, 000 other staff, of whom about 85 0, mainlyindustrial staff, would have been recruited locally.8*      Capital CostsPresent estimates show that the capital cost of the PFR atDounreay, together with its high voltage transmission lines, wouldbe  30 million, which is about  3 million more than at Winfrith.The difference is mainly accounted for by the length of the trans -mission links from Doxmreay: a single line of about 100 miles toconnect with the main grid together with strengthening the existinglines for a further 100 miles south of the connecting point.    On theother hand, the Scottish electricity boards would in any case have toconstruct the latter lines in future yea.rs, and their discounted value would be about   2. 3 million in 1970.    Thus, the overall extra capital cost of siting at Dounreay v/ould be about   0. 7 million at 1970 values.-2-SECRET
9.      The Scottish Office say that the Aberdeen and Dundee areas will require an additional source of electrical power by 1975.     this demand could be met in part by a PFil at Dounreay, importing the restfrom the central belt;  or by a new local station.    In the scottish office view, if the PFR does not go to Dounreay, it would meanproviding 25 0 MW capacity by uneconomic methods, which would entail additional expenditure of around  2 million by 1975, equivalentto  1. 5 million at 197 0 values.     However, it may be unwise to relytoo firmly on the PFR as a basic source of supply.    This reactor,after all, will be a prototype of an advanced system; and even afterthe first five years of experimental operation, there may be times when further experiments are required and the reactor may not be wholly available for electricity production.10.     If the PFR were sited at Winfrith, it would equally contribute to the Central Electricity Generating 3oard&apos;s (CEGB) generatingcapa.city and save the latter some capital expenditure.    But, becauseof the size of the system and the large number of factors involved, itis not possible to quantify this saving.* * *     Operating CostsOperating costs would not be significantly different at the twosites.    As to the price of electricity to be delivered to the grid fromthe PFR, the Generating Boards cannot give firm quotations at thisstage of what they would be prepared to pay; but the Scottish boards have indicated that they see no grounds for assuming a significantlylower value per unit for output from Dounreay than from Winfrith.There would, however, be a 2 per cent greater transmission loss overthe long lines from Dounreay, and the 1970 value of this loss would beabout   0. 6 million.     The additional costs, capital and operating, ofsiting at Dounreay therefore total about   1. 3 million on 1970 values.This balance leaves aside whatever additional costs may be incurred in providing generating capacity either in North-East Scotland or south-West England and also any loss of revenue that might arise fromthe increased risk of breakdowns in the transmission links fromDounreay.12.     If the PFR  v/ere to go to Dounreay much of the backgroundphysics work for fast reactor development would have to be carriedout at Winfrith, where the facilities exist.    And despite all the linksthat exist - scheduled and chartered flights, telephone and telex -there must be some loss of efficiency in having parts of the work sowidely separated.    Moreover, the staffing of professional grades atDounreay has always been a difficulty and would inevitably remain so.Account must also be taken of the annual cost of maintaining tworeactor development establishments instead of one.    This is difficultto estimate.    The cost of the additional supporting staff andassociated site services which would be required if the s?,rne amountof work were spread, over two sites, when it could be done at one, worksout at about  -f million a year.    This, however, takes no account ofthe loss in efficiency caused by spreading work rather thinly between two development sites which are far apart.    This is extremely difficultto estimate; But Sir William Penney considers that a fair assessmentwould be 10 per cent of the cost of the programme.    In money termsthis represents some  -f million a yea.r, making about  l-j million ayear in all during the period while research and development is going on at the two establishments.
There are two other important considerations.     Other thingsbeing equal, one would not choose to cite the PFR producing 25 0 MWof power, at the end of a long line fa.r from the electricity demand.Secondly, a PFR at Dounreay would be remote from the major UnitedKingdom customer (the CEGB) and from overseas visitors whom we wish to interest in the reactor.    We are anxious to keep the UnitedKingdom in the forefront of fast reactor development so that we can,when the time comes, sell fast reactors abroad.    It is bound toproduce a damaging result if, by building at a remote site likeDounreay, we lead potential overseas customers to conclude that   ,fast reactors cannot safely be brought near to populated areas.Safety considerations were a major factor in the choice of Dounreayfor the experimental fast reactor early in the 1950&apos;s, when, inparticular, the difficulties and possible dangers of using sodium as acoolant were very much in mind.    But we do not want to give theimpression that this cautious siting policy for fast reactors is still necessary.15.     Social and other considerationsMany benefits have flowed to Caithness through the setting upof Dounreay,    Unless suitable arrangements were made, the running down and eventual closure of the establishment would creat a serious problem for the area.    However, we should not suppose that by placing the PFR at Dounreay we should solve the area&apos;s problems.The Dounreay establishment has not so far proved to be a &quot;growthpoint&quot;.    There is no reason to expect that the PFR, which will be a highly capital-intensive facility, will have a different result.^&apos;     Planning permissionPending a decision on the site, the Authority have not beenable to approach planning authorities.    No difficulty would be met atDounreay.    At Winfrith, there is ever-/ reason to believe that the reaction of the planning authorities would be favourable, but there might be local objections and the need for a public enquiry.**     conclusion the foregoing discussion suggests strongly that on economicand operational grounds the proper site for the PFR is Winfrith, whichI recommend to my colleagues.F. C.Ministry of Technology, S. W, I.3rd February, 1966-4-SEGRET &apos; v &apos;13.     The capitalisation of the penalties incurred by operating tworesearch and development establishments in place of one is sodependent on assumptions about the period of tune the nuclear powerdevelopment programme will continue, that any calculation can belittle more than a guess.    However, if the PFR were to go to Dounreay,a fair volume of research and development would continue for at leastten years, so that the cumulative extra expenditure over the perioddue to the maintenance of two establishments would amount to atleast  15 million (say  8 million at 1970 values).      The netestimated saving by choosing Winfrith rather than Dounreay is thereforeat least  7. 8 million, or say roundly  8 million on 197 0 values,14,     Technical considerations
