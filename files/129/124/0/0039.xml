IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT)LEISURE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE, ENGLAND AND WALES:DRAFT i&apos;&apos;.&apos;i&quot;iITE -xAPExNote by the Minister of Land and Natural ResourcesI attach, for the consideration of the Cabinet, the draft of a white Paper on Leisure in the Countryside, which I propose, if theCabinet agree, to publish on 28th February.2.       I have not yet received the agreement of the Chancellor of theExchequer to the proposal tha.t grants to local authorities in this fieldshould be at a level of 75 per cent.    I think this level is the right one,bearing in mind in particular that the projects in question will serve theneeds of visitors more than they will serve the ratepayers, and that thisis the level of existing grants;  and it would be difficult for the treatmentof this small and specialised expenditure to be used as an argument inother fields.C(66) 3922rd February, 1966CABINETF. T. W.Ministry off Land and Natural Resources, S, vV&quot;, 1.21st February, 1966.
C 0 M HBE M T Q A LDRAFT WHITE PAPERLEJJ3URE    IN    THE   COUNTRYSIDEENGLAND   AND   WALESINTRODUCTION1. If present trends continue, by the end of the centurythere will be some 19 million more people in England and Walesthan at present.       Siting new houses, factories, roads andpublic utilities for their needs and renewing what is alreadyor will become obsolete will be a formidable task for themachinery of planning.     The problem is not primarily one of finding land for new buildings;    the task is to site them and design them so that cities will in themselves be pleasant placesto live in and when town-dwellers want to spend their leisure inthe countryside they can reach it quickly and in comfort.2. We have only limited freedom of action in distributingour population. Most of the extra 19 million people will bethe growth of families in the existing large centres of population, such as South Lancashire, the West Riding and london, where congestion is already serious.       Nor can thefacts of geography be ignored, though they are less constrictingthan they once were, when the location of industry and commerceis being planned:     our towns cannot all be resited, nor all our railways and roads rebuilt. No planning of the distri-bution of the population can prevent there being several greatfocal points from which people will visit the countryside; andno road programme that the country can afford will preventdisagreeable congestion if most people have to travel a long distance to seek relaxation in the countryside.3. The growth of the urban population, and the expansion ofindustry, must be reconciled with the need for greater home foodproduction and increased efficiency in farming, which are1.
equally important in the National Plan.       Land capable of highagricultural return is a scarce resource, and must not be wastedby lack of thought and planning.      Equally, the i?ask of the farmers in producing food more efficiently from less land mustnot be made more difficult by failure to tackle the problemcaused by the increasing numbers of visitors to the countryside.The Government are determined to seek within thethey inevitably facelimitations/the best possible distribution and the best sitingand layout of towns and cities.     They believe   firmly in thedevelopment of a national plan of location.     This should be neither simply the sum of local or regional plans, nor a comprehensive and detailed plan imposed from the centre.      Itmust be a framework against which local and regional proposals are worked out and considered.       This framework is being evolved.5&apos;        Given that townspeople ought to be able to spend theirleisure in the country if they want to, that they will have moreleisure and that in future they will be able to buy cars andboats and otherwise spend money on their week-ends and holidays;the problem is to enable them to enjoy this leisure without harm to those who live and work in the country, and without spoilingwhat they go to the countryside to seek.       The present proposals of the Government are concerned with this problem.The proposals take as their base the National Parks and access to the Countryside Act of 19L-9. This was passed withwide support from all   those who value   the countryside.       It has led to the creation of ten National parks and of new long-distance footpaths, and to access agreementsopening up thousands of acres of country previously barred toall but a few.       A valuable national asset has been created,and the present proposals are intended to prevent its beingspoilt.2.   &apos;
&apos;*        But the developments of the last sixteen years have heenmore rapid, and on a greater scale, than could have heen foreseenin 19h9, when the country was only beginning to recover from thewar, There is now more money, more leisure, and above allthere are more cars.       If, in these new conditions, the originalintentions of the National parks and Access to the CountrysideAct 19h9 are to be fulfilled, and if the National Parks are toretain their distinctive character, then it is essential to makenew provision for the enjoyment of the countryside elsewhereboth to meet public demand and to relieve pressure on remote oroutstandingly beautiful places.ADMINISTRATION^* The National Parks Commission were given two mainfunctions:    to preserve and enhance natural beauty, particularlyin the areas designated as National Parks or Areas of OutstandingNatural Beauty;    and to encourage the provision of facilities forthe enjoyment of the National Parks.       The Commission havedischarged those functions patiently and well, and the nationowes the Commissioners a debt which the Government gladlyacknowledge.       Eut the time has come to enlarge the Commission&apos;sscope so that their functions will include the encouragement of opportunities for the general enjoyment of the countryside.    TheGovernment therefore propose that the Commission shall be reconstituted and renamed the Countryside Commission.       The caredevoted to the National Parks must oertainly not be reduced;   .,what the Government propose is an addition to existing functions,not their dilution.9. The wider scope of the reconstituted Commission will needsome strengthening of the staff.     Additions have already been3.
made to cope with increasing work under the 19h9 Act, and other staff are &quot;beingrecruited to start planning for what is nowproposed.       Preparatory research is also being&apos; done by theMinistry of Land and natural Resources, with help fromuniversities.10.    The Commission will work under the general guidance ofthe Minister of Land and Natural Resources and the Secretary ofState for Wales, who will settle broad lines of policy and the overall rate of expenditure.11.      It will be the Commission&apos;s responsibility to advise theGovernment on the protection of the countryside in the light of growing demands for the enjoyment of leisure there, and of pressure from development of all kinds.      It must be the aim tosee that a fair balance is struck between the needs of thosewho live and work in the country and the needs of visitors.    Thedivergent interests of those who visit the countryside simplyfor relaxation or active recreation, and of those whose concernis primarily with the conservation or study of its natural orman-made features, will also need to be reconciled.     A majortask will be to stimulate and co-ordinate education in the need to conserve the unique features of the countryside.      TheCommission will act as a source of, and a clearing house for,ideas and techniques, and will provide effective liaisonbetwden the bodies concerned with meeting the demand for- facilities.       They will undertake, or arrange for, research into countryside problems, and will assess priorities.    above all, they will support local initiative with advice and encouragement, and stimulation where need be.
Relations   with.,the Sports Council12.      The creation of the Countryside Commission will in no waydiminish the importance of the Sports Council, which will remain responsible for advising the Government on the development ofamateur sport and physical recreation services.      The Commission&apos;sconcern, in this field, will he primarily with enjoyment of the opportunities which the countryside gives for what is described in the 191+9 Act as &quot;open-air recreation&quot; - a phrase which theNational Parks Commission have rightly interpreted in itsbroadest and least specialised sense.     Their interest will becomplementary to the Sports Council&apos;s primary interest inphysical recreation and outdoor activities in the more special-ised sense.       There will need to be close co-operation betweenthe Commission, the Sports Council and the regional sportscouncils, and arrangements will be made to that end.National Parks^3*       No immediate major change is proposed in the administratively-ive arrangements within the National Parks.      The Governmenthave, however, been impressed with the weight of opinion infavour of joint planning boards for those Parks which cover morethan one county, and they hope that the planning authorities concerned will consider very seriously the possibility of a change.The Government will consider whether it would be desirable toexercise their power to revoke existing arrangements if furtherexperience shows this to be required.FINANCE14.       Under the 19k9 Act specific Exchequer grant at the rateof 75% can be paid towards the costs of what is done by thelocal planning authorities for preserving or enhancing natural5.
natural beauty and for its enjoyment in the National parks and the Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.     these arrangements will be extended to what is proposed in this paper for the countryside generally.15.        It is also proposed that Exchequer grant, at the rate of75$,should be payable towards the additional administrative expenses of National Park planning authorities involved in thecreation of new facilities or the improvement of the landscape.THE MEASURES PROPOSEDiWhatever changes may come in leisure habits, and however much our towns may be made more fit for living, a very largenumber of people will probably continue to spend a large part oftheir free time in their motor cars, visiting the countrysideand the coast. And the number of cars which is already 9 million is expected to reach 26   million by   1980. &quot; - ...        ...17.    This movement away from the towns in leisure time is constantly growing;     and it is taking place in mid-week as wellas week-ends, and in spring, autumn and winter as well as summer.No one would want to halt the process.       And the government believe that, given the will and the means, the countrysideneed not be spoilt if the area of choice before the town-dwelleris enlarged.     The family who want to spend a day or a week-endaway from towns can at present go to the coast;     to the NationalParks and similar areas;    or to a limited number of recognised&quot;beauty spots&quot; or open spaces or country-houses and gardens opento the public.       These may or may not be at a convenientdistance.       They v/ill probably find that driving there is slow
and frustrating, and when they get there that too many others have had the same idea.      Other areas might do just as well, andmight he easier to reach. But at present there is no positive reason for going there, and there may he drawbacks:there is nowhere off the road to park the car, nowhere to picnieor ramble and nowhere for the children to paddle or play games. PiiSArjyi Parks^*       The Government accordingly propose that the area of choiceshould be enlarged by the provision of what might be called^Country Parks&quot;.       These would serve three purposes.      Theywould make it easier for town-dwellers to enjoy their leisure inthe open, without travelling too far and adding to congestionon the roads;      they would ease the pressure on the more remoteand solitary places;    and they would reduce the risk of damage tothe countryside - aesthetic as well as physical - which oftencomes about when people simply settle down for an hour or a daywhere it suits them, somewhere &quot;in the country&quot; - to the  incon -vfseolenee and indeed expense of the countryman who lives and worksthere.&apos;9* - Some    areas which serve these purposes have existed for many years, and more have been created in the recent past,as opportunity offered, notably by the National Trust.      TheGovernment propose that more should be created, as rapidly asthe need for them appears and the country&apos;s economic situationpermits.20. The Government believe ,.thai a wide discretionshould bo given to the Countryside Commission     andthe authorities planning and creating Country Parks.    They wouldvary widely in size and in the type of facility provided.      Some
would &quot;be quite small;    others would extend to several hundreds ofacresc       Some would be quite simple, with only the minimum basicworks, while in others there might be a restaurant, a boatinglake or paddling pool and perhaps some ornamental water.      Insome of the larger parks it would clearly be right to allot spacefor organised sports, as well as space for simple unorganisedgames.       In such cases, the local authorities would find itdesirable to work in close co-operation with the regional sportscouncils and other interests concerned with sport.p AThe main instrument for the creation of Country Parkswould, it is proposed, be the County Councils.      But, as visitorscould be expected to come from many places, there would need tobe arrangements by which the County Council in whose area a  4Park lies could collaborate with other authorities.     County andunty Borough Councils, including the Greater London Council, would begiven power to contribute to the cost of establishing CountryParks outside their own administrative boundaries,    for thebenefit of their own ratepayers.      Informal arrangements wouldbe sufficient in some cases;    in others, a formal consortium/   of local authorities might be desirable.       The good offices ofthe Countryside Commission would be available if required inthe promotion of such joint schemes. It will also beprovided that, exceptionally, a County Borough or the greater london Council may take the initiative in establishing a&apos; Country Park outside their own area, vnith the agreement of thehost authority.220       The County Councils would be required, in planning CountryParks, to consult the County District Councils which may be,   concerned, and it will be provided that, exceptionally, a county district Council may itself create a Country Park with theagreement of the County Council.
23.        The local authorities administering Country Parks wouldusually have to own the land or hold a lease of it, and they willhe given powers of acquisition accordingly, including purchase hycompulsion if the appropriate Minister agrees.      But it will not always be necessary that the authority should own the land orhold a tenancy of it.     Where, for example, land is already usedfor purposes comparable to those which the Country Parks are intended to serve, but the owner is unable to bear the cost of necessary additional works, the authority would be empowered tocontribute to their cost.       In other cases, an owner mightprefer, instead of selling or leasing the land required, to enterinto arrangements with the authorities for its management, thelocal authority bearing or contributing to the cost of capitalworks.       All arrangements of this kind would have to be subjectto adequate safeguards for public funds.^*       To be effective, planning of the location and design of country Parks, indeed all planning for the use of the countrysidefor leisure, will need to be undertaken in the light of countydevelopment plans and the regional plans of the Economic planning councils, and will involve extensive consultation with the countryside Commission and for example   between planning andhighway authorities and between local government and the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food   and other Governmentdepartments concerned with rural development.      There will also need to be consultation with regional sports councils wheresporting activities are involved.25. &apos; :Grant will be payable on approved expenditure on the acquisitionof land for Country Parks; the creation of the necessary basicworks such as landscaping, car parks, lavatories and roads;
litter removal;    warden services where required;    and majoritems of renewal and repair.       In assessing the amount of grant,account will betaken   of any revenue which could reasonably beexpected,,       Approved contributions by local authorities towardscapital expenditure on the purchase of land and on works in Parksoutside their own administrative areas will qualify for grant;and so will approved costs incurred by local authorities in-respect of works carried out on land which is used as a CountryPark but is not in public ownership.^ &apos;        Discussions with the County Councils Association haveshown that their members will use widely and imaginatively thismeans of enlarging the area of choice open to visitors to the countryside.       A number of Councils have already initiatedcomparable schemes.       But other means will be needed as well.PjLcgiic^ PlacesThere v/ill be places in the countryside and on the coastwhere a Country Park would not be justified, but somethingbetter than a lay-by is needed by the family who want to stopfor a few hours 9  perhaps to picnic, or to explore the footpaths,or simply to sit and enjoy the view and the fresh air.Accordingly, local authorities will be empowered to create such places where they are most needed with an acre or so of land,space for parking cars, lavatories and litter bins.    exchequer grant would be payable.Access to Water28.       Reservoirs an^^^atJ^j^j^jQrp^grounds^     Although many water undertakers have found it possible to allow their reservoirs to&apos;:be widely used for recreation, access to many reservoirs Isstill restricted and sometimes forbidden without sufficient
reason.       Subject to proper safety measures, there is no reasonto deny public access to reservoirs used solely for riverregulation or compensation.     Public access to reservoirs fromwhich water is taken directly into public supply involvesgreater hazards, and the first essential is the safety of thepublic water supply.       Methods have been developed by which thehazard from many recreational activities can be eliminated.29.       The Government believe that there are reservoirs of bothkinds where, with suitable planning management and supervision,access for such pursuits as angling, bird-watching and some formsof boating may be permitted.30.       The Minister of Land and Natural Resources has had someuseful discussions with the British Waterworks Association, anda joint circular will shortly be issued by the Ministers concernedasking the bodies which control reservoirs to overhaul theirpresent rules governing public access to reservoirs and gatheringgrounds, and to submit before the end of the year a statement oftheir future arrangements.     There are ways in which local autho-rities can help:    for example, by providing accommodation forclubs, lavatories, car parks and equipment for water activities.31.New reservoirs should present no problem.     Arrangementsusually are and certainly should be made at the planning stageso that the full recreational possibilities can be taken intoaccount and the appropriate facilities - such as access roads and car parks, fish hatcheries and fish passes, jetties and sewerage - can be included in the plans.32.       RjLvers and Canals.       The nation possesses a considerablepotential for all kinds of recreation in the extensive network of inland waterways in England and Wales - rivers, canals andin some places, such as the Pens, the great drainage channels.
12.CONFIDENTIAL33.       For many leisure pursuits, such as walking and picnicking,the prime need is a waterside path kept in good repair.     for various reasons this is often not available, and the Governmentare examining with the organisations involved what legislative or other measures should be taken to resolve the conflicts ofinterest which often are at the root of the difficulties.3h.       One such conflict of interest is the disturbance of fishand fishermen by those who find their pleasure in boating orswimming.      It is essentially a matter to be resolved locally,so far as possible by consultation and give-and-take, leading to the framing of byelaws.     Another problem is the quality ofsewage and factory effluent in waterways.      The machinery, ofcontrol exists in the powers of river authorities, and in spiteof increases in population and industry waterways are becomingcleaner, not dirtier.       Improvement of standards is primarilya matter of priorities in local expenditure.      The existenceof well-run angling societies and other local clubs has been of advantage in dealing with these problems.35.       Some waterways, like the Thames and the Norfolk Broads,are used by craft of all kinds in summer, and are sometimesovercrowded;    but many, perhaps most, other stretches of waterare little used for most of the time.       The British WaterwaysBoard&apos;s receipts for pleasure boat licences are in no waycommensurate with the cost of keeping navigable for poweredcraft the greater part of their network which is no longer ofany significance for commercial transport. The revenuewhich mpst river authorities obtain from boating is similarlyvery small. There are various things that affect the rate at which demand grows.       Among them are the availability of access points from which people can launch boats after bringing them to the water by car;     the number and distribution of
Oldconcerns offering &quot;boats for hire;      the availability of basinsand moorings;    the ease with which rights of passage can beobtained;    and freedom from obstructions and pollution.Although the British Waterways Board have made strenuous efforts to promote the use of their waterways for boating, and severalsocieties are very active in the field, there are still somethings that can be done to bring opportunities to the noticeof potential users.     In short, there is a task of co-ordinationto be performed in bringing about greater use of the opportun-ities that exist.36. Financially, the aim must be to do everything possibleto increase revenue and keep costs down;    but some continuedsubsidisation will be necessary if facilities for boating areto be provided.       Experience will show, as time.goes on,what opportunities for increasing use, and so increasingrevenues, do exist, and plans must be flexible enough to be adjusted accordingly.       It will be for those who use waterwaysfor recreation to show what facilities they wish to support.37.       The Government will seek to evolve, in conjunction withthe river authorities, public bodies and others concerned,and with appropriate advice, comprehensive plans for developing the use for recreation of the country&apos;s waterways, natural and artificial.       There will need to be studies of a broad kind,covering the size, type, and location of future demands and ,the factors determining them, and the physical assets thatexist;    and detailed studies of appropriate treatment for individual stretches of water, in the light of potentialdemands of all kinds and costs.       Much valuable information is now available for the first time in the British Vt/aterwaysBoard&apos;s report, &quot;The Facts about the Waterways.&quot; Where boatingis concerned, it will be necessary to consider the different13.COMFIDEMTIAL
standards to &quot;be aimed at for particular stretches, varying fromthe standard required by large pleasure cruisers to what theBritish Waterways Board refer to as navigability as a tour deforce.       Throughout, full consideration will be given to theneeds of anglers who on some rivers already have a clearpriority.38. There are many people in this country who are knowledg-able about, and care greatly about, the use of rivers and canalsfor recreation.       There must clearly be opportunities for thesetalents and energies to play their part in the future of the waterways.39*       Gravel Pits.       Excellent opportunities for the creationof recreational facilities are provided on a substantial scaleby disused gravel pits.       In south-east England especiallythese are mostly wet workings.     Tne Government intend toexamine, with the local authorities and the industrial interests concerned, the possibility of creating well-landscaped lagoonsin many places, especially near to towns, for the enjoyment ofsailing and other water sports.1+0.       Natural Lakes. There is scope for greater use of natural lakes for recreation,and much can be done to meet the growing demand.       But the value of some lakes lies in theirbeauty, which would be seriously damaged by some forms of watersport, though it need not be harmed by others.      The reconcil-iation of the claims of amenity and recreation will call fortact and understanding from all the interests concerned.^ *       Cj5&amp;sta1 Jjdaters,.       The great increase in the popularityof sailing calls also for the provision on the coast of moreyacht harbours, moorings, access and launching points for thosewho wish to sail in the estuaries and on the sea.      Much isbeing done in this direction by private enterprise and by clubs,14.N
and some local authorities are working actively with voluntaryassociations to provide facilities of this kind.      The importanceof good design and location in projects of this kind cannot heoverstressed. The Government welcome this local initiative in tackling the problem which arises because the facilities which were enough when yachting was a pastime of the comfortablyoff are quite inadequate now that yachtsmen and dinghy sailorsare numbered in thousands.Access to Open Countryh-2.       The National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act ofprovided that all local planning authorities should consider what action they should take by access agreements or orders orby purchase to secure public access to open country, that is&quot;land consisting wholly or predominantly of mountain, moor,heath, down, cliff or foreshore&quot;.       The authorities were required,when this had been done   to publish maps of the open country intheir area or where there was no open country, a certificate tothat effect.h-3.       In view of the change in circumstances since the reviewswere completed, the Government propose to ask all local planning authorities to institute a fresh review and to send to the countryside Commissions;1 for transmission to the appropriateMinisters, revised plans based on the vigorous use of all their powers.       In order to help them to put these plans into action,expenditure on the purchase of land.for access, on compensation under access agreements or orders and on a warden service willbe eligible for grant throughout the countryside and not, as atpresent, in the National Parks and Areas of Outstanding NaturalBeauty only.Uh.     Under the 1 9^9 Act access to open country can be secured by access agreement, but these agreements can be made only overland which is itself open country as defined in the Act.    This
limitation will be removed so that they may he made over any land which is heeded to give access to open country.     The powerto make hyelaws for the protection of access land and for thepreservation of order, and to appoint wardens for the purpose,would he extended accordingly.k5. Progress in making the survey of footpaths and bridlewayswhich was required of County Councils under the 19h9 Act, hasbeen disappointing.       In the sixteen years since its passage,only half   the      councils have published definitive maps.    TheGovernment have pressed the authorities concerned to make aspecial effort to complete the work without further delay.h-6.      It is clear that some amendments to the legislation, whichis in some respects out-of-date, are required.     For example,County Councils and the National Park planning authoritiesshould be given concurrent powers to act as footpath creationauthorities, without having first to apply to the Minister fora direction;      and some simplification of the procedure for thecreation, diversion and closure of footpaths is necessary in theinterests both of users and of landowners and occupiers.      TheGovernment propose to introduce changes in the legislationaccordingly.hi. But in the Government&apos;s view a more radical reformmay well be needed, to provide a legislative framework whichwould permit the development of a system of footpaths andbridleways, some based on existing routes, but others newlycreated, which would be more suited to modern nedds.      Such asystem might ideally consist of a carefully-planned network,providing attractive routes on foot or horseback between and around centres of interest which, being more regularly used,16.
could &quot;be more readily kept fit for use;    while the routeswhich no longer serve any generally useful purpose could beallowed to disappear. The Government propose accordingly to consult further with the interests concerned, to see whetherthis idea is generally acceptable, and if so, what changes inthe lav/, including perhaps the creation of new administrative machinery, would be desirable.Long-Distance Routes1+8. The Countryside   Commission, like the National ParksCommission, will be responsible for proposing long-distanceroutes.     They will be asked to give a high priority to this work and to ensure that the long interval between the designationof a route and its opening for use is reduced.commons+9*      It would be premature to include in the proposed legis-lation the second stage of general legislation designed to securethe better use of common land - better use in incteased productiv-ity and in wider public access.       But it is proposed that wherea public right of access already exists over a common, or where such a right is granted in the future, the local authority should have power to acquire a limited area of the common,and toconstruct access roads, car parks&apos; and simple buildings andfences where appropriate, so that it can be used as a &apos;CountryPark. This would enable the right of access to the common to be more effectively used.     A simplified procedure will beintroduced to enable the authority to obtain Ministerialagreement, after consideration of any local objections, tothe acquisition of land and the creation of simple facilitiesfor this purpose.17.
18..Camping and Caravan Sites50. There is a need for more camping and caravan sites,to be used primarily as staging points by holidaymakers in transit.     Where demand is heavy and extends through a long-season, it is reasonable to assume that clubs or private personswill meet this need, since revenue could be expected to matchexpenditure.     Where this is not the case and the result is thatholidaymakers in transit are forced for lack of adequate sitesto stay over-night in lay-bys or on the roadside or otherunsuitable places, the local planning authority will be empoweredand encouraged to provide well-designed and well-planned siteswith the aid of grants.Trees and WootOjands51. Changes in agricultural practice and the continuingemphasis on increased efficiency in farming   are togethermaking for a striking change in the face of the countrysidebecause of the loss of trees and hedgerows, particularly notiee-able in lowland England, which for generations has character-istically been a country of small fields, scattered woods andhedgerows.       Changes there must be, but the losses can be made good by new planting.    Trees may also be used with good effectto screen obtrusive buildings and eyesores;    and even a well-dewigned group of buildings can often be improved by judicioustree-planting. The Government will therefore ask localauthorities to embark on an extensive programme of tree plantingbut in small woods, clumps and rowsin the countryside, not in the main in large woodlands/ and to manage them themselves or arrange for their management by other public authorities or landowners.      It might be convenient in suitable cases to enter into agreements with landowners for theplanting and management of trees on their own land.       Local
planning authorities already have power to acquire land and plant trees on it, hut an Exchequer grant is payable only inthe National Parks and Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty.In future, approved expenditure willbe eligible for grantelsewhere in the countryside.52. Although the felling of trees and hedgerows is oftennecessary if changes in agricultural practice or planneddevelopment are to proceed, not all fellings are justified hygenuine economic or practical needs;     and some trees orclumps of trees may have special value in the landscape whichentitles them to special consideration.       The government therefore propose to ask local planning authorities to review,in consultation with the Forestry Commission, their arrangementsfor the making of Tree Preservation Orders, with a view toidentifying those trees and woodlands which are of particular importance as features of the landscape and which ought not tobe felled without the consent of the planning authority and before arrangements can be made for their replacement.     TheGovernment have been reviewing the procedure for the making ofTree Preservation Orders and its relation to the fellinglicence provisions of the Forestry Act 1951, and wil.1 propose any necessary legislative changes,53. Problems will continue to arise with woodlands whichhave hitherto been mainly of broad-leaved trees like oak,beech, ash and sycamore and which are being converted toconifers, usually with the aid of grants from the forestry commission.       Over much of Britain a conifer wood can enhancethe beauty of the countryside, but there are areas where a planning authority would be right to urge that at least someof the woodland should be planted with broad-leaved species.19.
It should he possible to reconcile the claims of commercialforestry and amenity;    and the Forestry Commission willcontinue their practice of co-operating with the planning authorities and the woodland owners in working out acceptablesolutions.       Where a planning authority&apos;s minimum requirements are incompatible with management on a reasonable commercial basis, the Government propose that the owner should be empoweredto require the purchase of the wood by the authority, who wouldbe able to claim grant towards the purchase price.5U. Much of the planting by the Forestry Commission,particularly in the upland areas, will have to be of conifers.The Commission have shown for many years that they appreciate the need to reconcile the claims of amenity with efficientproduction;    and it is the Governmenfs policy that they shouldtake aecount of the needs of amenity in the planting and manage-ment of their woods.       The Commission are opening theirforests to the public as freely as possible, and have providedcaravan, camping and picnic sites, lay-bys and other facilities.Eyesores55c       Much of the countryside is disfigured by structures suchas huts, shacks, and dumps of abandoned cars and other unwantedmaterial.       It can be expensive to get rid of these eyesores,both because of the cost of removal and because compensation mayhave to be paid.      But the problem has to be tackled.      TheGovernment propose, therefore, that the Countryside Commissionand the local planning authorities should combine to work out a programme of action, covering some years, concentrating at firston removing the more obtrusive eyesores from the most attractiveplaces.       Approved expenditure by local planning authorities,including compensation under discontinuance orders, will be
eligible for grant aid.       This proposal is separate from theGovernments recently announced proposals for the rehabilitation of land which has been so damaged by industrial or otherdevelopment as to be unusable without treatment.56. Voluntary effort can be very useful here.      The CivicTrust hopes to announce very shortly its campaign (for townas well as countryside) under v/hich local bodies and organis-ations, civic societies and all others interested in the environment, will be encouraged to co-operate with the localauthorities, largely by undertaking the work of physicalremoval or improvement.     The Government will encourage localauthorities to make full use of their powers to assist voluntaryefforts of this kind by lending equipment and contributing to administrative expenses.The Coast57. Too much of the coast has already been spoilt by badlysited development.       Most of this took place before theintroduction of planning control;     but the Government intend to ensure that as much as possible of the coast is kept open and unspoilt in future.      There must be reasonablefacilities for public access and recreation by the sea, but theymust not be allowed to spoil the amenities v/hich people come to enjoy.       A series of regional conferences with all the coastalplanning authorities has been arranged so that a thorough examination can be made of the problems of the coast and themeasures required to deal with them.     These conferences willprovide a firm foundation for future planning policy.Meanwhile, the planning authorities have been asked to review their present policies as a matter of urgency and to defineclearly the lengths of coast they propose to protect in future.21 .
3 9 958.       The Government have pledged their support for&quot;Enterprise Neptune&quot;, the National Trust&apos;s appeal for  2 million to enable it to acquire further stretches1 of the coast, andhave themselves contributed  ^ million.Regulation of Motor Traffic59.       Existing powers to regulate motor traffic have been found,in practice, to be inappropriate to the needs of National parks and other designated areas.       It is therefore proposed to take special powers to regulate traffic in National Parks, Areas of outstanding Natural Beauty and, where necessary, in and on the approaches to Country Parks where some sorts of traffic might endanger the natural beauty of the area or impair its enjoymentby the public.Byelaws60. As the use of the countryside increases,so does thepossibility of conflict between different activities.      TheGovernment are therefore examining whether the powers of localauthorities to make byelaws over land and water need to be strengthened.CONCLUSION61. The essence of these proposals ie to invite Parliamentto give elected local bodies the powers and the financial help that they need to ensure that the resources of the countryside match the needs of the nation and to enlarge thescope of the National Parks Commission by creating a CountrysideCommission to promote and co-ordinate action and to advise theGovernment on the measures needed for the full enj oyment of the countryside and the protection of its natural beauty.
62. The Government will introduce a Bill to give effectto their proposals.     Meanwhile, reconnaissance, planning and research are needed &quot;both locally and nationally so that whenlegislation has been enacted work can begin on well thoughtout schemes without delay.\\
