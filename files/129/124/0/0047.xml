W. 1.1st March, 1966III
-r v- &quot;ST &quot;ST V^5.   -ft.   J\   J\   J\I am now able to give you a first reaction to the variousfinancial points which you raised at our meeting on 16th Febmxary.It is already clear from our preliminary studies that if the BBC is toconsider its expenditure in the same drastic terms as have been applied to Defence expenditure by the Government, we can see our wayto survival on the basis of a  5 combined licence and the exercise ofour initial borrowing powers for two years, and perhaps for three(that is until the end of 1967 or 1968).    At that time, there would haveto be an increase in the licence fee.2.     Our calculations are based in part on the result of action already taken by the BBC, and on further action which we could take during thenext two years.     We have been conducting in recent months an intensive review of our administrative practices, and the savings which have emerged from this review are now beginning to yield a significant return.    It is possible that further savings remain to berealised and we shall continue our studies to this end, probably inconjunction with outside specialists in the technical and operationalfields.    In addition, we believe that we could make cuts in activities which we have hitherto considered well justified, but which, againstthe background of continuing financial stringency, may perhaps have tobe sacrificed to the overriding national demand for economy - and evenausterity.    These further cuts would be of a permanent character and could be expected to yield continuing savings,3.      Our initial calculations rest upon certain assumptions which appeared to us to emerge from what ycu said in the course of our meeting.     The most important of these was that the Government wouldbe willing to introduce in 1966 legislation to make possible more active measures to reduce licence evasion.    A statement now of theGovernment^ intention to introduce such legislation might well providethe basis for some initial voluntary co-operation from the televisionrental companies.\\4.     The next assumption which we drew from the conversation -and it is, perhaps, of equal importance m was that the Governmentwould be prepared to deal with Independent Television in such a way asto prevent the programme companies from taking advantage of theBBCs financial limitations during the period in which we would seek to live within a  5 licence.     The a-activities of Independent Televisioncould affect us in two ways.    The first would be by a competitiveinflation of programme costs.    The second would be the extension of hours of television broadcasting,i i5.      The BBC would be seriously embarrassed if the programme companies were to adopte a policy of inflationary offers to Unions,promoters, artists and staff.    We already have evidence that thishappens even in present circumstances.    Lavish offers have beenmade to artists - some of whom were developed in the first instance by the BBC.     We have been unable to retain their services because wehave found it impossible to match the financial inducements held out tothem by the programme companies.    We should wish also to draw your\-1-
attention to the inflationary effect on fees from even the presentlimited experiment in Pay Television supported, as it is, by Viewsportwith its interest in large-screen television for public showing.    We arealready feeling the practical effects of such inflationary offers in thefield of sports promotions.     Once the new levels of fees have beenestablished by the intervention of Pay Television and Viewsport theyare unlikely to be reduced.     The strain on the BBCs resources wouldbe permanent.6.     If the Government were to accede to the request of theIndependent Television Authority for an extension of the hours ofgeneral television broadcasting it would be necessary for it also to concede parity to the BBC.    We should then be placed in a position inwhich we could not continue to live within, our present income.    Further,any extension of hours would seriously prejudice our capacity to meetthe wishes of the Government should we be asked to undertake theproduction of programmes for the &quot;University of the Air&quot;.    Suchproduction would make a maximum call on our studio facilities, andwe should be unable to respond if these had already been pre-emptedby the general programmes which would result from an extension of normal television programme hours.7.     Although it did hot form part of our discussion on 16th February,I should like at this point to refer to the Postmaster General&apos;s newsuggestions about a music programme incorporating advertising, whichhe put to us on Friday afternoon.    Our reaction was that theseproposals were ruled out on programme considerations alone andwould be seen by important sections of the audience as an unjustifiabledeprivation.    I confirm that this is our considered view.    Nor do wethink that the financial proceeds would represent a significant,alleviation of the BBCs financial problem.8.     To sum. up, the long term prospect for the BBC is of a periodof restriction, drs.stic economy and some reliance on borrowing for thenext two years, followed by a need for an increase in the licence fee in either late 1967 or perhaps in 1968.     If, in the meantime, themeasures to be taken against licence evasion produce anything like theirpotential yield, an increase of the licence fee to  6 at that time mightwell carry us through until the mid 1970s - in fact almost to the end ofthe present Charter period.     There is, as we said at our meeting, nosuch daunting prospect as an annual increase of 10/- in the amount ofthe licence fee.    This is far beyond anything that has ever been contemplated by the BBC, even during the recent period ofunprecedented expansion,9.     There remains the question of colour television.    We recognisethat it would not be in the national interest for Britain to fall behind therest of Europe in this important technological field.    In the knowledge that several major West European countries are now definitelycommitted to a start on colour television in the autumn of 1967, wehave concluded that our budgetary provision for a start in colour television before the end of 1967 should not be reduced in the coursecf our financial review.
10.     The essential foundations for the long-term prospect I have outlined, which we must look to the Government to provide, are strict control of the activities of competing television organisations, and early and comprehensive legislation to reduce licence evasion.    On thebasis of the necessary assurances, v/hich we have assumed would be forthcoming from the Government, we, for our part, are prepared toaccept the implications of a re-assessment of our activities againstthe background of the realistic needs of the nation s economy.-v.r s.-   -%r    \y-J&apos;%   .fi   ^s,   j(V   -ii.P. S.     This letter was on the point of being sent when Cheminant&apos;sletter of 25th February arrived.    I think that my letter deals either directly or indirectly with most of the main issue.es which you raised,but my immediate comments on the three specific points whichCheminant mentions are as follows\-(a) The implications for the BBC of an annual expenditureceiling v/ould come within our study of the various possible techniques v/hich we could apply in order to achieve the economies of which I have spoken.(b) The possible transfer of staff out of London, as sir Hugh Greene mentioned at our meeting, has alreadybeen considered.    One major scheme had to be deferredbecause the capital expenditure was immediate and the continuing savings could be realised only after a periodof years.    The realisation of some of the BBCs capitalassets in central London, though no doubt profitable asindividual transactions, could not yield disposable sums of a sise which could significantly affect the BBCsgeneral financial position.    The &quot;decanting&quot; process(that is, the temporary housing of staff in the period between the sale of their present accommodation andthe acquisition of property outside London) would be expensive, and we have to remember that oui* principalsaleable asset (the Langharn Hotel) involves relatively lowoutgoings, as compared with other central or outer Londonproperties,(c) The provision by the BBC to local broadcasting stationsof technical and engineering facilities would not in ourview yield any substantial profit for the BBC - and certainly not enough to make a significant difference toour finances, either now or in the longer   term.Moreover, v/e should have some doubts about whetherthe BBC should be seen to be making a profit out of services rendered to another public service, whatever the source of that public service!s revenue.
