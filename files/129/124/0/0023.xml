CONFIDENTIAL . am147DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 23 COPY NO,   6 67th February, 1966CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  PLANNING AND CONTROLPROOF &quot;WHITE paper note by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues will recall that on 3rd December last year I circulated a paper (C(65) 169) to which was attached a draft White paper on the Planning and Control of Public Expenditure.2.       This was discussed at a Cabinet meeting on 7th December(C(65) 68th Conclusions, Minute 5).    The Cabinet generally welcomed the proposal to publish the White Paper a.s a contribution to publicunderstanding of the machinery of control now operated by theGovernment and of the need to relate total expenditure in any one fieldto expenditure in other fields;  but felt that it would be preferable to publish it at about the same time as the Estimates for 1966-67 were published.3.      I am now circulating for the information of my colleagues a revised version of the White Paper which I propose to publish at thesame time as the Vote on Account, on [7.1 at] February.    Apart from theexcision, in deference to the views expressed at the Cabinet meetingon 7th December, of the Appendix on the criteria for proposals for civil and technological projects, the only major change since the last versionis the addition of a new section (Part V1TI) dealing with 1966-67.    Theonly other changes made are such as are necessary to bring variousreferences and figures in the White Paper up to date:  some of the figures are still not final.    The publication of the public investment figures for1966-67 and 1969-70 in Tables 5 and 6 should help to reassure theconstruction industry of the future scale of public sector demand.4.       In order to meet the printing time-table for publication on21st February, the text must be  finalised within a week, and I would be grateful if my colleagues could let me have any amendments by Thursday,10th February.Li.

PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: PLANNING A*AND CONTROLI IntroductionOne of the Governmenfs first tasks when they came into office was toexamine the prospects and priorities of public expenditure. There were large expansion programmes in progress for the various public services,which had been published in outline in December, 1963*. These did not, inthe Governmenfs view, provide adequately for the nation&apos;s social or economicneeds. Even so, they would have fully absorbed for the years ahead the future growth of revenue at the rates of taxation then ruling, even if the nation hadmanaged to achieve a regular rate of growth of the gross national productas high as 4 per cent a year.2. The Government began a review of public expenditure in order toredeploy for more productive purposes and for the strengthening of thebalance of payments the resources which were engaged on work which theGovernment considered to be of low economic priority ; to give effect to theGovernments own concepts of social priority ; and to bring the growth ofpublic expenditure into a sounder relationship with the development of thenational economy.3. The process of reshaping involved : (a) A decision to limit the total growth of public sector expenditure toan average of 4J per cent a year at constant prices from 1964-65 to1969-70: this was subsequently confirmed as part of the national plan.f(fe) Within this total, a long-term allocation of resources to each of themain public services to provide the quantitative framework for their development.(c) A strict review of individual programmes, in particular of defence.(d) The preparation of Estimates within specified limits so as to ensuretheir consistency with (a) and (b).(e) A review of the investment of the nationalised industries to fit in with the National Plan.(/) More effective implementation of the programmes and an improve-ment of financial control, to get better value for money.4. This White Paper describes the first results of this reshaping, theprocedure which the Government adopted to carry it out, and the methods by which the Government intend to continue the process in the future toenable the public services to make the best possible contribution to thedevelopment of the national economy and to provide for the most importantsocial priorities, the programmes of social improvement and economic expansion going forward together, each dependent upon the other, as partof the National Plan.

II Aggregate of Public Sector expenditure . The Governments object throughout has been to look at public expenditure as a whole; to make the best possible estimate of the cost wheneach question has come forward for decision ; and to present the choicesbetween different programmes and between alternative courses within them.In their first days in office the Government considered the choices open tothem in this way and decided their first social priorities, which were toincrease the rates of national insurance and associated benefits and to remove the prescription charges.6. These choices are made from a comprehensive aggregate of public sector expenditure, including both current and capital expenditure by central and by local government, and the gross outgoings of the National insurance funds, but excluding debt interest. This total was about  10,500 million in1964-65. It involves expenditure of many kinds, e.g., purchase of defence equipment and laboratory supplies; the employment of soldiers and hospitalstaffs by the central government, and of teachers and firemen by localgovernment; the construction of houses, schools and roads ; payments ofnational insurance benefits and of national assistance to those in need;support for agriculture; loans and grants to firms moving to development districts ; aid to under-developed countries.7. These expenditures are linked by three common strands. First, allare decided by Government, central and local, on grounds of public interest.Secondly, they generally involve directly or indirectly a claim on the nation&apos;sproductive resources^ a direct claim where the Government are employingmanpower, buying goods or paying for construction, and an indirect claimwhere the Government pay pensions or family allowances, or give grants to universities or loans to industrial enterprises. Such &quot; transfer payments &quot;give their recipients a claim on resources, which becomes an addition to demand except to the extent that the payments are saved ; and in most casesthe circumstances are such that the payments are spent. Thirdly, all theseexpenditures are paid for either from taxation, local rates or national insurance contributions, or by borrowing from the public*.8. The investment of nationalised industries and of certain other public corporations like the B.B.C., and the Exchequer advances to them, arehandled separately. This is because the nationalised industries are enterprisesproducing goods and services for sale; and the size and composition of their investment are considered in relation to the industrial needs of the economy and the commercial policy of the undertakings themselves, and have less in common with the generality of central and local government expenditurethan with that of the rest of industry. Because this is not true of subsidies to them, they are included in the aggregate.9. For review and control purposes the aggregate of public sector expenditure is divided into functional blocks. Each heading defence budget, education, health and welfare, benefits and assistance, and so on includes all the expenditure for the particular purpose. For example, theeducation total includes the pay of teachers and other running costs, new building, provision of equipment and student awards for the whole range* The receipts and expenditure of the public sector are analysed in Appendix iii.
of publicly-financed educational institutions from primary schools to universities-ties, whether these are the responsibility of the Department of education and Science and the Scottish Education Department, or of the localauthorities, or of private bodies, such as universities, receiving grants and loans from Government Departments and local authorities.10. This classification enables the Government to consider the develop-ment of the various services as a whole, and to decide the priorities betweenthem. Each main block is within the scope of one Minister (except wherethere are separate Departments for Scotland and Wales); and each minister is able to decide how to use the resources allocated to him within it. Theextent to which the whole block of expenditure is under the detailed controlof the Minister will vary from case to case; but even where the minister has no formal control, as with much local authority expenditure, the Govern-ment Department^ policy and the procedures for determining the level ofGovernment grant or approving loan sanctions for capital expenditure maybring the dimensions and direction of the development of the services withinthe influence of the Minister.11. The aggregate of public sector expenditure is dominated by a fewlarge programmes. The defence budget, roads, public housing investment and subsidies, education, health and welfare, benefits and assistance account for about three-quarters of the total. Some important programmes, such asassistance to industry, cannot be realistically predicted over a long period;so the main programmes represent an even greater proportion of thoseexpenditures for which long-term programmes can be drawn up in advance.12. The period 1964-65 to 1969-70 was chosen for the review. the out-turn for the base year 1964-65 was not then known and an estimate was used: the expenditure for the year 1965-66 was to a considerable extentdetermined by the plans of the previous Government: four more years were then covered to 1969-70. In general, this is the most convenient period for considering the development of most of the main public services for many it is the time required to train skilled staffs and to plan and buildnew capital facilities.13. The nature and technology of most of the main public services require a planning period of four or five years. The phasing of development ofthese services is therefore such that substantial changes of direction cannotquickly be made without risk of dislocation. Nevertheless the defence review is aimed at eliminating a prospective 20 per cent increase in expenditure from 1964-65 to 1969-70; and this has involved a radicalreview of world-wide commitments, weapon systems and procurementarrangements. The savings thus secured will make a substantial contributionto higher rates of growth in other services of high economic or socialvalue.Ill The 1965 Survey and Allocation14. In order to draw up a comprehensive set of public sector expenditure programmes, the Government had to decide at an early stage how muchpublic expenditure should be provided for in the period up to 1969-70.The preparation of forward estimates of the cost implications Of public expenditure policies was a familiar one: there had been an annual Survey30281
of public sector expenditure from 1961 onwards, in accordance with therecommendations of the Plowden Committee*. The essential and novelelement was the procedure of deciding first how much the country could afford ; then deciding how this could best be deployed ; and finally requiringeach spending Minister to arrange his expenditure within his agreed allocation.15. The Department of Economic Affairs and the Treasury therefore prepared an initial assessment of the growth of gross national productwhich could reasonably be expected, and then of the resources which were required to improve the balance of payments, to strengthen private and nationalised industries&apos; investment, to provide for the expansion of public expenditure on the lines of the policies then ruling, and to allow for thegrowth of private consumption.16. The outcome was the Cabinefs decision in January, 1965, that the rateof growth of the aggregate of public sector expenditure (as defined above)from 1964-65f to 1969-70 should not exceed 23 per cent (i.e. an average of4\ per cent a year) at constant prices. It was necessary to decide thisprovisional guide-line first in order to establish an effective starting-point for the reshaping of programmes. The decision was announced in parliament by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 22nd February, 1965, when presenting the Vote on Account (see Appendix I).17. The 1965 Survey of public sector expenditure began as soon asthe Cabinet decision had been made, starting with instructions for a detailed costing by all spending Departments of their policies for theperiod 1964-65 to 1969-70. These were divided between &quot;basic&quot; pro-grammes, which were to be drawn up within limits laid down in advance and related to the developments of the individual services already in train,and &quot; additional&quot; programmes representing the cost of further improvements which could be undertaken if more resources were made available. The pro-grammes were prepared at constant prices, so that the change in expendi-ture shown from year to year excluded any effect which price changes(including changes in wages and salaries) might have on the amount ofmoney to be spent.J18. The returns by Departments covered the whole field of public sector expenditure. They were subjected to a rigorous scrutiny in order to ensure:  (a) that the financial implications of existing policies had been fullytaken into account in the &quot; basic &quot; programmes ;(b) that realistic costings had been made of the &quot; additional&quot; programmes and policies.19. There was available to the Government in June, following this examination, a detailed Survey of the prospects for public expenditure, whichcovered both &quot; basic &quot; and &quot; additional &quot; programmes, and this was agreed* &quot; The Control of Public Expenditure &quot;.  Cmnd. 1432 (July, 1961).t The out-turn for 1964-65 was lower than had been expected in January, 1965: the cabinet&apos;s decision related to the comparison with the figures and definitions at the time ofthe original statement, which are set out in the tables in Appendix ELi The figures for current expenditure on goods and services wree prepared as nearly aspossible on the same price basis as the 1965-66 Budget Estimates. Figures for capitalexpenditure were mostly at March, 1965 prices. Payments such as subsidies and grants and loans to industry, which do not involve the direct purchase of goods and services, weremeasured in such a way as to make no allowance for any effects from price changes. the costings prepared on the basis described are referred to collectively as &quot; at 1965 Survey prices &quot;.
by the spending Departments and the Treasury and the Department ofEconomic Affairs to be as realistic and accurate a costing as was possible.20. The Survey provided for a contingency allowance of  100 million for1969-70 in order to make some provision for possible needs for extra expendi-ture by the Government in circumstances which cannot be foreseen (e.g., fornatural calamities) and for the tendency for the implementation of policies to cost more than expected. The allowance made is three-quarters of oneper cent of total expenditure.21. While the Survey of public expenditure was taking place, the pre-paration of the National Plan was proceeding. More refined analysis ofthe economic prospects for the period from 1964 to 1970 confirmed the initial decision limiting the growth of public sector expenditure to 4  percent a year at constant prices. The examination of the prospects of theconstruction and engineering industries, and the prospective supply and demand for manpower, showed where special pressures were likely to exist;and these were taken into account in the scrutiny of the expenditure pro-grammes. One fact of particular importance was the requirement of the health and education services together with public administration for some500,000* extra people between 1964 and 1970, a requirement greater thanthe total increase of manpower expected to be available. This conclusionput great weight on the importance of efficiency in the use of manpowerthroughout the public sector, and illustrated the existence of physical aswell as financial limitations to the expansion of these services.22. The Survey was considered, together with the relevant evidenceaccumulating from the work on the Plan, by a group of senior Ministers,none of whom had large Departmental responsibilities for any particularblock of expenditure, under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Ex-chequer. The Ministers responsible for the main expenditure programmes were consulted one by one. In the light of this examination, the Grouprecommended the adoption of specified limits for each of the main programmes of expenditure, both for 1966-67 and for 1969-70. The Group made then-report to the Cabinet in July, and decisions were taken on each of the main programmes for the two years in question. The decisions in respect of1969-70 were announced in the National Plan.IV  Composition of Public Sector Expenditure23. In parallel with this process of Survey and allocation, the review,announced in October, 1964, of certain programmes was in progress ; and theultimate shaping of the programmes resulted from the combined effect of these operations and also from the day-to-day decisions taken in the course ofthe year.24. The defence review was under way by Christmas, 1964. The defence white PaperJ presented in February, 1965, formulated the problem of finding the means by which defence expenditure during the next few years mightbe contained at roughly the then current figure in real terms. The continua-tion of previously existing policy would have involved an increase at constant* The National Plan, chapter 2, para. 18t The Tables in Appendix II are developed from and supplement those in chapter 18of the National Plan.% &quot; Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1965 &quot;.

prices from an estimated  2,000 million in 1964-65 to  2,400 million by1969-70; and after the first stages of the review the Government were ableto adopt the reduction to  2,000 million in 1969-70 as a definite objectiveon which economic planning could be based. [A series of decisions wastaken from January onwards, notably on aircraft procurement, the futureof the Army reserves, and the cancellation of the fifth Polaris submarine,which went more than half-way towards the target of a saving of  400million.1&quot;]25. Civil defence, preparations have also been reviewed and will be limitedso that annual expenditure is brought below the rising level of recent years.Compared with  22-7 million in 1965-66, estimated expenditure in 1966-67will amount to  19-7 million.26. Expenditure on overseas assistance, which is to a large extent deter-mined some two years in advance by previous decisions, is expected to rise from about  190 million a year in 1964-65 to about  225 million in 1966-67on the basis of existing commitments. The future programme will dependon periodic reviews in the light of progress made in overcoming our economic problems.27. In the social and community services, the main characteristics of thereshaping of programmest have been:  (a) A very large expansion:in public sector housing investment and asubstantial increase in subsidies, involving increases of 33 per cent and 68 per cent respectively from 1964-65 to 1969-70.1. (b) A continuing expansion from 1964-65 to 1969-70 in education(32 per cent) and health and welfare (23-^ per cent).- &apos; (c) In benefits and assistance, an increase of 38 per cent, of which8 per cent is attributable to growth in the number of beneficiaries:the first priority has been given to the introduction of earnings-related benefit in the early months of unemployment, sickness,i;.!?:    industrial injury and widowhood.(d) The police and prisons services show together an increase of 22 percent.(e) For roads, the increase is just over 40 per cent, with construction and major improvements showing an increase of over 70 per cent to 364 million in 1969-70, but this increase in expenditure will be insufficient to match the growth of congestion in the period underreview.(/) The control of miscellaneous local authority investment (mainly civicoffices and recreational projects) has been tightened.28. On the economic side, major decisions include the schemes to intro-duce an entirely new system of investment incentives to concentrate Govern-ment assistance when the need to increase investment is greatest ;** and to&apos;    set up an Industrial Re-organisation Corporation to promote greater efficiency,in British industry through schemes of rationalisation and modemisationtt-* Statement by Secretary of State for Defence, 5th August, 1965.

In addition, a large number of measures have been taken or announced to stimulate mobility of labour and advanced technology, with considerableextra expenditure, e.g. expansion of training facilities; redundancy payments to improve the mobility of labour ; special funds for the National Coal board to expedite closure of uneconomic pits ; increased funds for the NationalResearch Development Corporation^ investment in innovations in such fieldsas computers, machine tools and process control; encouragement of farmamalgamations ; export promotion; and the National Ports CounciPsdevelopment programme.29. The composition of public sector expenditure (Appendix II, Table 1)will change considerably in the next few years. Defence and related expendi-ture will proportionately be taking much less; there will be greaterexpenditure on incentives and services which are designed to improve the performance of the national economy: the need to improve the socialinfrastructure, notably in housing but also in communications, related to regional development, will certainly involve large increases particularly ofcapital expenditure: the education and health services will continue to expand: and the growing numbers of old people, and the desire to improve their standard of living in line with that of the rest of the community, will involve rapidly increasing expenditures on benefits and assistance of allkinds.30. In terms of economic category also the composition of public sector expenditure will change between 1964-65 and 1969-70 (Appendix II, Table 2).Capital formation (i.e. expenditure on houses, roads, schools, hospitals, etc.)is likely to increase by nearly 50 per cent: this expenditure together with the investment of the nationalised industries and other domestic capital expendi-ture* is set out in greater detail in Tables 5 and 6 in Appendix II and shows a total capital increase of nearly 28 per cent. Current expenditure on goods and services is likely to increase by only 15 per cent, with the stabilisation of defence expenditure, nearly all of which, whether of current or capitalcharacter, is, under national accounting conventionsf, included in this cate-gory. The 38 per cent increase in current grants to persons is duepredominantly to benefits and assistance, but there are other rapidly expand-ing items here, such as grants to universities.31. In Appendix II, Table 3, the totals are divided by spending authority Government Departments, national insurance funds, local authorities. Theincrease in local authorities&apos; expenditure, current and capital, is put at 35 percent, reflecting the development of education, roads and housing. This rapidprospective growth of local authorities&apos; expenditure underlines the need forthe change in the financial relationship between central and local governmentwhich is now under discussion between the Departments and the localauthority associations, and which will be the subject of legislation duringthe present Session of Parliament.V Development of Long-Terra Programmes32. The 1965 Survey and allocation operations have established guide-lines for the development of each of the main services, with specific limits for 1966-67 and 1969-70. Similar limits will be established for those smallerservices for which it is practicable to draw up a long-term programme.* For a definition of this term see footnote (1) to Table 6, Appendix II.t See explanatory notes to Table 2, Appendix II.
33. These five-year guide-lines have a dual purpose, for they provide a framework both for the planning of the service and for financial control.The Minister in charge of each service has as much assurance as it is prac-ticable to give of the resources which will be at the disposal of the service.This enables him to plan how to use them to the best advantage, and itgreatly eases the day-to-day operation of financial control.34. The extent to which there are specific long-term programmes inphysical terms depends upon the administrative and technological content of each service. In defence, the period of weapons production is so longthat ten-year costings are needed, and have been used for some years. the functional costings system * has also been set up as a tool for long-term defence planning. The technology of the road programme requires that it should be planned in detail over a period of five years, with some judgment made ofwhat development will be possible for a further period of years. In theeducation programme, the two crucial long-term factors are the supply of teachers and the supply of buildings ; and in the latter it is the general practice for programmes of starts to be authorised to local authorities and universities three years ahead (i.e. in respect of buildings to be finishedfive or more years ahead). In the health service, a long-term hospitalprogramme is in progress, and the allocations for running costs are settledfirmly for the coming year and provisionally for the next year or twothereafter. In housing the need to plan well ahead, covering both the public and private sectors, has become increasingly evident.35. This long-term planning of the public services has developed farin recent years and will be extended further; and this can now be done with more assurance. The shift of emphasis to the evaluation and appraisal of long-term programmes and the long-term allocation of resources to them is leading to the development of better methods to measure and comparethe cost-effectiveness of alternative courses of action. In the variouseconomic services, and particularly the investment of nationalised industries,the techniques of appraisal are being continuously improved (see paragraph44 below). Likewise in defence, the appraisal of the military effectiveness of alternative weapon systems in relation to their cost is now being increas-ingly developed: the process makes it possible to choose either the cheapestmeans of accomplishing a defined military objective, or the means ofderiving the maximum military value from a given expenditure of resources. There are analogous opportunities for applying similar tech-techniques in the social and community services; and as the long-term pro-grammes become more clearly defined, the use of these tools of manage-ment will extend, and better value for money will result.iBOoi srlj hm ajnamhisqaCL.sri naawJc-d so\min?\h ish&amp;v won.;;] doiriw36. The extension of commitment of the national resources for several.years ahead means that there has to be an element of flexibility in the programmes, as is shown in paragraphs 54 et seq. below. They representtoo large a part of the use of resources to be independent of fluctuations in the national economy. Moreover, the physical programmes themselvesneed to be flexible enough to be adjusted for unexpected populationmovements, changes in costs and techniques, and new social and economic developments.* Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1965, paras. 36-40.
37. About 85 per cent of the whole of public sector expenditure is ofa kind which is suitable for long-term planning within fixed financial limits on the lines described, though the scope for specific long-term programmesdefined in physical terms is much less. For this 85 per cent it wouldappear to be possible to draw up five-year costings of expenditure with asufficient degree of realism to permit an allocation to be made and financial control to be exercised accordingly.38. For the remaining 15 per cent, in which it is impracticable to draw up a long-term programme or to work to a long-term financial allocation,other forms of control ensure that aggregate expenditure on these does not increase excessively fast and carry the total of public expenditure abovethe level which has been laid down.39. In most of these cases, the cost of a specific policy in a particularyear can be forecast only within wide limits. The out-turn of the agricul-tural subsidies every year will depend heavily upon the level of productionand the course of world prices: under the present guaranteed price system,therefore, it is impossible to confine this part of expenditure on agricul-ture within predetermined limits. Expenditure on agricultural services andon the long-term improvement of agriculture is also difficult to forecast, butit is less subject to wholly unpredictable factors. Firms moving to the develop-ment districts have been entitled to giants for buildings and for plant and machinery at fixed percentage rates ; but this has not enabled precise esti-mates of expenditure to be made since it has proved very difficult to predicthow many applicants there will be and how long will elapse before the grantsrequire to be paid. The size of the British Railways Board deficit dependsin part on variable factors beyond the Board&apos;s control. Some kinds of work,particularly but not exclusively in the field of advanced technology, are subjectto large and unforeseen escalations of cost.40. In each of these illustrations, however, the Governments actionsare of major importance to the cost. The strength of the stimuli givento production in the Farm Price Review, the size and attractiveness of grants under the Local Employment Act, decisions on proposals to close uneconomicrailway services, the cost control of the projects which are liable to escalate:all lead clearly to short-term and long-term increases or decreases in cost.The importance of cost-effectiveness and the appraisal of proper choicesare as great here as in the services for which long-term programmes are practicable.VI Nationalised Industries41. For reasons described in paragraph 8, the investment of nationalised industries is not included in the aggregate of public sector expenditure, andis not therefore subject to the limits imposed upon this aggregate. The invest-ment of these industries, and their sound development, are at the centre ofthe National Plan, partly because of their strategic importance to the economy,and partly because of their size (capital  8,800 million; labour force approach-ing 2 million ; output about one-tenth of gross domestic product; investment of  1,350 million in 1965-66, or about the same as that of the whole of manufacturing industry). They are also of great significance because theydepend upon the Exchequer for their supplies of new capital in so far as theycannot provide these from their own resources.
42. These investment programmes were examined in order to ensure thattheir size and content were adequate to provide the necessary energy, transport and communications for the economic expansion provided in the Plan. Theestimated capital expenditure in 1964-65/-66/-67 and in 1969-70 is set out for each undertaking in Table 5 in Appendix II. This table incorporatesthe decisions on these programmes taken by the Government since the publica-tion of the National Plan.* The rapid expansion in recent years which isexpected to take the total of nationalised industries&apos; investment up from  1,188million in 1964-65 to  1,462 million in 1966-67 is coming to an end, and thetotal is expected to fall to  1,406 million by 1969-70. The effect of this coursewill be to free resources after 1967 for other public investment, for privatemanufacturing investment, and for exports.43. Of the increase from 1964-65 to 1966-67 of  274 million, or 23 percent, in nationalised industries&apos; investment,  122 million is attributable toelectricity,  61 million to gas, and  70 million to the Post Office. In thefollowing years to 1969-70, the level of Post Office investment will expandsubstantially. This is expected to be more than offset by the fall in theelectricity programme as the increased generating capacity initiated in recentyears to overcome the dangers of power shortages in the expanding economycomes into service: the position will be reconsidered in the light of this winter&apos;s experience.44. The scale of the investment is such that the Government and theindustries themselves are devoting increasing attention to the techniques and criteria for investment appraisal. Allowance must be made for thesocial and non-economic obligations which most nationalised industries arerequired to undertake. But having done this, it is essential, in order to ensurethe most efficient deployment of the national resources, that the minimumreturn on new capital in the nationalised industries should be comparable with that obtainable elsewhere in the economy. The most up-to-datetechniques are being developed in order to carry this into effect. The appraisalsof the development of the nuclear power programme, of the choice betweenthe various projects for developing the South Wales iron ore ports, and of theelectrification of the railway line from London to Southampton andBournemouth are important recent examples, f45. The financial objectives which have been agreed from time to time between these industries and the Government have defined the return to besought on the industries&apos; capital assets as a whole and have been the guide-lines for the industries&apos; commercial practices. Some of these objectives,including those for the electricity and gas industries, expire during the courseof this year, and new objectives have to be set for B.O.A.C. and the british airports Authority. These will be considered in the context of the Govern-menfs undertaking to retain and develop the system of financial objectives.(See Hansard, 22nd December, 1964, Cols. 231-244.) The nationalised industries, like other industries, are subject to the Governments generalpolicy on prices and incomes. The Government have made it clear that they expect these industries to do all they can to absorb increases in costs by increasing efficiency ; and have referred nationalised industries&apos; price proposals to the National Board for Prices and Incomes.* The National Plan, page 57.f &quot; Iron Ore Imports into South Wales &quot;, Cmnd. 2706 (July, 1965); and &quot; Fuel Policy&quot;,Cmnd. 2798 (October, 1965). u&apos; &apos; -
46. Over the entire field of nationalised industry, the return on capital in1964-65 averaged 4-2 per cent. There is a wide variation between the financial objectives of 8 per cent (net of depreciation at historic cost) and 12-4 per cent(gross) for the Post Office and the Electricity Council respectively, and the losses of the railways and the coal industry. The lower the return, thegreater is the financial call on the Exchequer; and in spite of the improvedfinancial performance in recent years, the industries borrowed over  550million from the Exchequer in 1964-65, and their borrowing will be more in 1965-66.47. Where it has been necessary to undertake full scale reorganisation ofan industry to meet changed economic circumstances, substantial sums ofcapital have also had to be written off or placed in suspense:  1,192 million for the British Transport Commission in 1962,  110 million for the british overseas Airways Corporation and  415 million for the National coal board in 1965. These write-offs are, in accounting terms, a recognitionof the changed value of the assets they represent, but the cancellation of the industries&apos; debt to the Exchequer which enables these sums to be written off in no way reduces the burden on the community. The Exchequerlends to the industries at the same rate as it borrows in the market. Theinterest payments made by the industries to the Exchequer just suffice tomeet the interest payments which the Exchequer must itself make to those from whom it has borrowed. When Exchequer loans to the industries arecancelled as part of a capital reconstruction, the Government must of coursecontinue to pay interest to the original lenders. The cancellation of exchequer loans to the amount of over  1,700 million in respect of the three reorganisa-tions above involves an annual permanent burden to the Exchequer on this account, which is at present of the order of  70 million.VII Phasing and Implementation48. The preceding sections describe the method by which the Govern-ment have undertaken the reshaping, which they began in October, 1964,of public expenditure programmes. They start from the Government^decision to contain the aggregate of public sector expenditure within adefinite limit up to 1969-70 ; and describe the process of the Survey of public expenditure and long-term allocation of resources between the main public services which followed ; and set out the pattern of expenditure which islikely to develop. This is *the establishment of a framework; and this finalsection sets out the problems that arise in working within this framework.49. First, the wide variety in the purposes, functions and economic natureof public expenditure, in the authorities responsible for it, and in the time-scales of the decisions involved, present a formidable problem of forecastingfuture costs and containing expenditures within the limits laid down. Withinthe 85 per cent of the aggregate of public sector expenditure for whichforward costings of policy can realistically be undertaken, there is no reasonto doubt that the quality of the costing will improve, though there willprobably continue to be a tendency to underestimate the future cost of carry-ing out particular policies.50. The question of control is more complex, because of the variety ofpublic authorities whose expenditure is involved. The expenditure of theGovernment Departments is of course under the continuous control exer-cised through the annual Estimates, and the out-turn is normally within a
reasonable margin of the original Estimates: in the last five years, the differ-ences have been+1-7 per cent, -1-3-5 per cent, + 1-5 per cent, -2-3 per cent,and -1-1 per cent respectively (all in money terms). But the margins increase considerably as the period lengthens. The expenditure of the national insurance Funds follows precisely from the Governments decisions on thevarious benefits and the numbers eligible for them, which can usually be predicted within a narrow margin. The extent to which the central govern-ment can affect the level of local authorities&apos; expenditure, which is about one-third of public sector expenditure, varies widely. There is control over then-capital expenditure through loan sanctions and in some cases through specificstatutory powers. For current expenditure, there is in general no specificGovernment control; but the local authorities&apos; policies are in many casesthe expression of national policies, and are subject to Departmental regula-tion, and the fixing of levels of grants affects the ability of the local authori-ties to incur expenditure.51. Taking public sector expenditure as a whole, it is not possible toexercise a fine control over substantial periods ahead, but the essence of thelong-term allocation system is to ensure that the decisions involving cornmit-ments of economic resources for the future are taken according to a rationalpattern of priorities and a realistic view of the implications for the national economy of providing these resources; and the technical possibilities of cost-ing and of financial control would seem adequate to support this.52. A problem not yet fully resolved is that which arises from the fact thatthe Survey and allocation of public sector programmes, and consequently the long-term programmes of the Departments, have to be carried out interms of constant prices because price changes do not affect the differentprogrammes in a uniform way. This gives rise to difficulty in comparing the actual expenditures recorded after the event with the provision madein the programmes. Moreover, figures at constant prices obscure the factthat there may be pay and price increases of an exceptional character.Further, from the point of view of financing, the increases in costs causedby increases in pay and material prices are as significant as those requiredby the expansion of the public services, and anomalies may arise when onekind of cost increase is treated differently from another.53. The treatment of future expenditure in terms of constant pay and prices tends to underestimate the future weight of the public services in rela-tion to the national economy as a whole. Wages and salaries represent a relatively larger part of the total cost of public services than of industry generally, and the concept of the &quot; productivity&quot; of workers in serviceslike defence and health and education cannot be as clear as in industry.Hence, if pay goes up in the public services at the same rate as in theprivate sector, the &quot; price &quot; (cost per unit in money terms) of providingthese services will rise faster than the average price level for the economy as a whole. This tendency is obscured in the programmes based on constant prices, and emerges in practice only as events unfold.54. Secondly, there is the need to work the system with a due flexibility.To control public expenditure too rigidly in terms of an aggregate could leadto anomalies. Some kinds of public expenditure are potentially advantageousin their effect upon the national economy: the composition of the total of
public expenditure is as important as its size; and if the composition isfavourable for economic growth it is possible for the nation to &quot;afford&quot;a larger total than if the composition were unfavourable. Some kinds ofpublic expenditure, on the other hand, call for particularly scarce kinds of resources, and must be limited accordingly. Great restraint on government expenditure overseas is likely to be necessary for as far ahead as can beseen. The public sector is such a large user of construction and some kinds of skilled manpower that its requirements have to be examined carefully fromthis point of view. The total amount of such public expenditure that thenation, can &quot; afford &quot; will depend upon the measures taken both in increasingsupply and restraining demands to deal with these particular constraints.Again, the new system of investment grants to manufacturing and extractiveindustries will substitute Government expenditure for tax reliefs ; and since this will result in more &quot; public sector expenditure &quot; as defined in this sectionit will be necessary in due course to re-define the total limits accordingly.55. The Government are likely to continue to need to establish a limit to the total of public sector expenditure in order to serve as a guide-line: but there may in future be room for changes in the definition andboundaries of the aggregate to which a limit is applied.56. Thirdly, there is the phasing of the programmes. In the early stages of the 5-year programme, the rate of increase in public expenditure is abovethe average rate from 1964-65 to 1969-70 of 4  per cent. Thus, the increase at constant prices from 1964-65 (as estimated at the time of the Survey) to1965-66 was estimated at [6-7] per cent after taking account of the defermentsannounced on 25th July, 1965. This is mainly because the programmes which the Government inherited on coming to power provided for very large increases in this period. The increase at constant prices from 1965-66 to1966-67 is not likely to exceed 4  per cent (see paragraph 70 below); and during the later years of the programme the growth of public expenditure islikely to slow down to less than 4j per cent, with the flattening out of thedefence programme playing an important part in this result.57. Thus the pattern of the programmes in the five-year period is a fasterincrease in the early years than in the later, a similar course to that in the totalof nationalised industries&apos; investment programmes (see paragraph 42).58. The immediate increase in public expenditure was more than the economy could bear, having regard to the pressure on resources and on thebalance of payments, and the Government therefore took the special measures announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 27th July, 1965 (seeAppendix I). These were designed to moderate the rate of growth of public expenditure as effectively as possible, and with the least possible interferencewith the most urgent social programmes. They concentrated on slowing down the rate of expenditure on capital projects and on deferring purchases of, equipment and stores, and they covered the whole of the public sector,including Government Departments, local authorities and nationalised industries.59. It was necessary to act rapidly to reduce the overload, and this made it impossible to carry out a detailed adjustment of programmes. TheGovernment therefore decided to postpone the starting dates of non-industrial projects for six months, but exempted all projects in development
districts, and houses, schools and hospitals. Loan sanctions were to begiven only in special circumstances for local authority loans for expenditureon land purchases in advance of requirements, on civic buildings, offices and a variety of miscellaneous projects ; and lending by local authorities on mortgages for house purchase was restricted. Government departments were instructed to act accordingly; circulars were sent to local authoritiesinviting their action likewise; and the chairmen of the nationalised industries were asked to help also.60. It is estimated that central and local government capital expenditureprojects to a total value of at least  200 million have been deferred for sixmonths. The effect of these deferments will be to reduce expenditure in1965-66 by some  40 million and in 1966-67 by about  60 million. Inaddition to this the deferment of expenditure by Government departments on stores and equipment will lead to further savings of  7 million in 1965-66and  6 million in 1966-67.61. The Chancellor wrote to the chairmen of the nationalised industriesdrawing their attention to the measures being taken to restrain expenditurein the public sector and asking for their co-operation in comparable measures.He made it clear that he was not asking for postponement of projects whichwere essential to economic growth over the next few years. As a result the industries are deferring expenditure of the order of  60 million.62. These deferment measures were temporary, and were designed toreduce the pressure of demand below the excessively high level which itwould otherwise have reached ; and they have contributed accordingly to theimprovement in the balance of payments. It was clearly necessary, however,that this temporary deferment of controls should give place to normalmethods of control; and on [8th] February, 1966, the Chancellor of theExchequer announced that die Departments&apos; programmes had been recon-structed accordingly, so that the savings of expenditure in 1965-66 and1966-67 would be made, but that the Departments would be able to re-programme their investment within the limits laid down.63. In the development of the long-term programmes the question ofphasing will recur, for public expenditure is too large an element in thenational economy to be treated entirely on a long-term basis independently of the short-term economic situation.VIII-The 1966-67 Estimates64. The procedures described in section III to determine the allocation of resources to the main public expenditure programmes five years aheadalso resulted in allocations for 1966-67. For the expenditures on Votesthis made it possible to establish a framework, taking account of the defer-ment measures of 27th July, 1965, within which each Department was required to prepare its Estimate for 1966-67. Special instructions weregiven to those Departments whose expenditures were not suitable for long-term programming. Many of these depend heavily upon the economic and international situation at the time when the Estimates are settled. nearly all the Votes are strongly affected by the course of wages and salaries and prices generally.65. When the Estimates had been submitted to the Treasury in december and had gone through the initial process of examination, the outstanding questions of policy on them were referred to the same group of senior
Ministers who had considered the long-term allocations in July, 1965(paragraph 22) in order to ensure that the same standards of stringency andpriority were being maintained over the whole range of government expenditure.66. The total of the Estimates for 1966-67 was ultimately fixed at [7760] million, an increase of  [626] million, or [8-9] per cent over theBudget Estimate for 1965-66. Of this increase,  [70] million is attributable to changes in classification, i.e. to the inclusion this year in Votes ofexpenditures which would otherwise appear as reductions of revenue (e.g.the corporation tax relief in respect of overspill) or which were formerlyadvanced from the Consolidated Fund (e.g. advances to the National ResearchDevelopment Corporation). Of the remaining  [556] million, it is estimatedthat  [ ] million is attributable to increases in pay and prices. Theincrease of expenditure at constant prices is [3-3] per cent, or, after adjust-ment for changes in classification, [2-3] per cent. The corresponding figurethis time last year, for the increase at constant prices at comparabledefinitions, from 1964-65 to 1965-66, was [5] per cent.67. The full analysis of the Estimates will appear in the FinancialSecretary&apos;s Memorandum on the Estimates to be published on [ March].The following table shows the main changes : 	Estimates	Budget Estimates			1966-67		1965-66		 m.	 m.	 m.

In terms of constant pay and prices, the Defence Budget for 1966-67is lower than that for 1965-66, and is how within the Governmenfs target of  2000 million at 1964 prices. Purchases of United States aircraft financed by the special credit will not of course be a charge on the Defence Budgetuntil the credit has to be repaid.69. The rest of the Estimates are up by [10] per cent, of which [6-^-] percent represents increases of pay and prices and [3 ] per cent increases at constant prices. Of the increases of  [503] million, the non-specific grants to local authorities (general grant, rate deficiency grant and the new raterebates; a large proportion of which is for education) represent  [170]million; the National Health Service  [117] million; universities and otherDepartment-financed education  [23] million; roads  [20] million; industrial
research  [17] million. The payments from the Exchequer for benefits and assistance will be little higher in 1966-67, because the last uprating tookplace in March 1965.70. The Governments objective is to contain the growth of public sector expenditure from 1964-65 to 1969-70 within an average increase of 4  percent per year at constant prices. Of the aggregate of public sector expenditure as defined for this purpose, the Estimates represent some 60-65 per cent.The remainder consists of Government expenditure not financed by Votes,and the expenditures of the National Insurance Funds and local authoritiesto the extent that these are not financed by Exchequer grants. It is too soon to make a firm estimate of the increase of these non-Vote public sectorexpenditures in 1966-67 compared with 1965-66, but it may be regardedas reasonably assured that the aggregate of public sector expenditure in1966-67, as defined in the Governments objective, will not be more than  per cent higher, at constant prices, than in 1965-66.IX Conclusions71. In conclusion, the Government have two approaches to the problemof expenditure planning and control, one the relatively long-term and onethe short-term. The decisions establishing limits for the main programmes for 1969-70 have provided a framework for the development of these services,and enable the Ministers in charge of these services to make their prioritychoices and plan ahead. This covers most of the field, and should ensurethat these main services will be expanded on a scale which can be accom-accommodated within the nation&apos;s resources and taxable capacity. Once thetotal has been established, to spend more on one item means spending lesson something else; and this is a true system of economic and socialpriorities. It is for debate and discussion how these choices should be modified in the years ahead.72. The implementation of the long-term programmes, together withthe process of taking decisions on those elements of public expenditure which are not suitable for long-term programming, are brought into sharperfocus in the work of the Estimates, which is designed to ensure that the ratesof development are kept within the limits which have been laid down, andto ensure that the short-term needs of the national economy are fully reflected in the course of public expenditure.73. The Survey of public sector expenditure is an annual one, and the1966 operation will decide what aggregate increase over the level establised for 1969-70 will be practicable for 1970-71, and how this is to be allocatedbetween the main programmes. This is how part of the Plan will rollforward another year, with guide-lines for. the development of the mainservices for a further year ahead. At the other end of the time-scale,decisions will be taken on the limits for 1967-68, which will again be thebasis for the work on the Estimates in the autumn of 1966. As the processbecomes more firmly established, the Survey and allocation operation willincreasingly take the form of a determination of long-term strategy in theoutlay of public sector expenditure, brought to a point of decision in theallocation between the main programmes for the fifth year ahead, and the fixing of the limit for the short-term need for cash for the Estimates forthe year immediately ahead.
74. The decisions taken by the Government within the last year haveformulated objectives for the development of the defence, industrial and social service expenditure programmes consistent with the needs andcapability of the economy as a whole. It was made clear in the national plan* that the successful accomplishment of these programmes is contingentupon the success of the economy in developing along the lines indicated inthe Plan. It will be necessary for the Government to control the phasing of the public expenditure programmes within the general limit of the average increase of A\ per cent a year at constant prices over the five-year periodso that the load on the economy which they represent does not increasefaster than the economy can bear.75. The Estimates for 1966-67 are an important step along this path.They reflect the results of the first reshaping of the individual expenditure programmes; and this first stage of the implementation of the long-termprogrammes has been achieved fully consistently with the aggregate limits of public sector expenditure which the Government laid down in their early months of office.* The National Plan, page 181.17i
Statements by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on Public ExpenditureExtract from the Budget Statement, 11th November, 1964[O.R. Cols. 1029-31][Mr. Callaghan]The expenditure programmes that we found in being for defence, thesocial services, houses, schools, hospitals, roads, will all entail substantially increased expenditure every year. By 1968 the total expenditure in thepublic sector will be  2,000 million more than it is today, without making any allowance for increased prices in the interim. This future expenditure is based on the revenue and savings that would accrue from a growth rate of4 per cent in our gross national product. Hon. Members will know that theaverage annual increase in our national product over the last five or six years has been only about 3 per cent, or a little less, and over the whole period from 1951 onwards has been no more than 2\ per cent.Putting it another way, the previous Administration have pledged our future revenues for the next four years on the basis of an underlying growth rate that they did not achieve and, looking at their record, they were unlikely to achieve. Of course, it is possible that the previous Government wouldhave achieved and maintained a 4 per cent growth rate for the next fouryears in a row. I do not say that miracles cannot happen, but the pro-grammes that we have taken over have been planned on the assumption thatthe miracles have already happened. Many of these programmes current and capital are, in practical terms, already committed. It will take timeto reshape them, but we intend to do this.Our first objective is to get the deployment of economic resources right.For example, large and important parts of our industrial and technologicalmanpower and capacity are locked up in production and research for theGovernment. It will be our urgent task to see how far this pattern shouldbe modified in the national interest so as to release resources for more productive purposes and for the expansion of exports. Defence will bein the forefront of this examination. This year&apos;s figure is over  2,000 million,of which  350 million is spent overseas and is a direct burden on the balanceof payments. This is the important point. The failure to secure value for money in the defence field has become a byword throughout the country:by relating commitments to resources it is our intention to ensure that the armed Forces are able to discharge their task with greater effectiveness and economy.We shall also examine those Government expenditures in the civil field which have an economic aspect to ensure that an adequate economic andfinancial return can be secured for the industrial and scientific manpower and capital which they absorb. The purpose of much of this expenditure is sound enough and it is not our intention to hack it with a meat chopper.In the first instance, therefore, we intend to ask a task group of senior officials including scientific and economic advisers to sort out these projects and appraise their economic priority.......We. shall then have a firm basis for action.
Next, my hon. Friend the Chief Secretary will be reviewing the remainingfield of civil expenditure and I have asked him to consider whether the priorities at present established are right or whether it is possible for theGovernment to release valuable men and plant for work which will strengthen the balance of payments and help expanding industry. We are looking forall economies, not just tiny economies, although it must be part of the chief secretary&apos;s task to try to get rid of the kind of waste to which the comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention in recent years. But our basicobjective is to find substantial cases where expenditure is not yielding full value in social and economic terms.To turn to the other side of the medal, there are, clearly, fields in which increased expenditure by the Government can help the modernisation of the economy and the improvement of the rate of technical progress. The helpthat is being given to ensure more rapid development in the under-employedareas of the country is a good example of this. I very much welcome thediscussions which my right hon. Friends the First Secretary and the Ministerof Labour are about to have with industry to help men move easily fromjobs where productivity is relatively low and opportunities are few to more productive and progressive employment.Extract from a Statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 22ndFebruary, 1965, about Supply Expenditure, 1965-66[O.R. Cols. 35-37][Mr. Callaghan]The Vote on Account, covering the Civil Estimates and the Defence(Central) Estimate, is being published this afternoon ... It is the Govern-ment s task to plan the purposive use of our economic resources as a whole,in order to secure, first, that total expenditure both public and private matchesthe resources that can be made available, and, second, that within the totalthere is a proper balance between the requirements of the public and private sectors. This means that the public sector may need to absorb a larger shareof our gross national product than it does today. But the growth of public expenditure must be effectively controlled so that social and economicpriorities can be duly secured in the National Economic Development plan which the Government are preparing.We have accordingly been considering the problem of planning the longer-term course not only of Central Government expenditure, but of thetotal expenditure of the whole public sector. A final decision on the detailsof this will be reached when the plan has been drawn up. Meanwhile, theGovernment have decided that the growth of public sector expenditure between 1964-65 and 1969-70, excluding the investment of the nationalised industries, will be related to the prospective increase in national production,which in our present judgment means limiting the average increase in public sector expenditure, taking one year with another, to 4  per cent a year at constant prices. This will mean a corresponding containment of the risein private sector expenditure. Only as a nation succeeds in raising theannual rate of production can public and private expenditure be increased.These decisions will provide a sound base for our policies for modernisingand expanding the national resources. They will also permit the progres-sive development of our economic and social policies, because expenditure will be realistically related to our capacity to embark upon new plans,
Extract from the Budget Statement, 6th April, 1965[O.R. Cols. 279-281][Mr. Callaghan]I now come to public expenditure. Both in my statement of 22ndFebruary and in my opening remarks today I have made it clear that it is our intention to plan the use of economic resources and to control the growth of public expenditure so that the right balance of economic and socialpriorities can be duly secured. The control of public expenditure will thereforebe used positively as well as negatively. The Government have decided thatthe growth of public expenditure between 1964-65 and 1969-70 will be related to the prospective increase in national production. In the Govern-menfs present judgment this means limiting the overall increase in public sector expenditure, excluding the investment of the nationalised industries,and taking one year with another, to 4J per cent a year at constant prices.We are examining the whole of public expenditure again in order to determinea proper order of priorities and to control waste.In the field of defence, reviews are being conducted to ascertain the changes that would be required to contain expenditure at roughly the 1964-65 figure in real terms. One of the most serious aspects of this problem is the growth of overseas military expenditure. This includes mamtaining our troops inGermany, the Middle East and the Far East. Since 1959 I ask the Committeeto note these figures this total has gone up year by year without let orhindrance from about  175 million to over  300 million, including defence aid.These payments across the exchanges constitute a serious drain on our balanceof payments. A reduction in them depends upon others as well as ourselves,but the economy badly needs some of the foreign exchange resources absorbed by the defence programme ; and the Government intend to secure a reductionin the existing burden.Altogether, about 1  nullion men and women are employed in the forces and in industry to supply them. These are important and scarce resourcesof manpower, needed for industrial expansion and for exports. It is against this background that the Government have had to consider the future ofthe TSR2 project. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defencehopes to catch your eye later in the debate this evening, Dr. King, in orderto make a full statement about the Governments policy and its decision to cancel the project.The effect of this decision is to save  35 million of Government expenditurein 1965-66, after taking account of the terminal costs which may becomedue to be paid this year. But, so far, this aircraft has cost  125 million, andthe cost is mounting fast every week. It has, and would have, divertedhundreds of factories employing thousands of skilled and semi-skilled menfrom other work of national importance, including exports in particular.This is not a sensible use of our overstrained resources. The government&apos;s decision will, in the next five years, release  350 million of resources of an advanced kind for more productive work.On expenditure in industry, my colleagues&apos; statements in the last fewdays about postal charges, railway closures and agricultural supportdemonstrate our policy and we do not intend to be moved from it that
these industries should continue to increase their contribution to the national economy. Where we believe that Government expenditure can have a constructive and fertilising effect on industry, we have shown ourselves readyto make the money available. In education, in health, in social security and in housing we are engaged in arranging our priorities so that we can get the best combination of programmes and the best value for moneywithin the expenditure which can be devoted to these purposes.Side by side with this is the review of local government finance which is going on, which will enable us to decide how the expenditure on the public services can best be shared between central and local sources of finance. Itis no easy matter to reshape public expenditure in a short time and wemust look further ahead than just the current year if we are to make a realimpact on these expenditures. But I commend to the Committee, and especially to my hon. Friends, the words of Robert Owen:&quot;Beneficial changes can alone take place by well digested and wellarranged plans temperately introduced and perseveringly pursued.&quot;I know only too well, as my predecessors did, of the pressure for higherpensions and for better pay; and I do not need to recall to any hon. Memberthe recent outcry about the state of some of our schools, the condition ofsome of pur hospitals and the wretchedness of some of London&apos;s housing.My earnest wish is to see the nation freely and willingly devoting thenecessary resources to satisfying the simple needs of ordinary men andwomen a home to live in, a school to learn in, a hospital when we aresick and a modest living for the elderly. But the fulfilment of these plansjosdes against the need for a healthy balance of payments as well as thedesire by all of us as individuals for an increase in our own personalstandards of living.For the reasons which I gave at the outset, in 1965 first priority mustbe given to balancing our overseas payments. I have already indicated themanner in which we are setting about this. Until we get this, we shall need to contain the rise in private expenditure. For the rest, a healthy balanceof payments is necessary to enable the economy to grow at a steady pace.Our most important task is to reconcile faster growth with a satisfactorybalance of payments. We look to the economic plan which is now being prepared to co-ordinate the conflicting claims made upon our resources by private expenditure, social expenditure, defence and industrial investment;and also to stimulate the economy into greater efficiency and productivity.Extract from a Statement by the Chancellor of the exchequer on 21th July, 1965[O.R. Cols. 228-30][Mr. Callaghan]. . . This year&apos;s balance of payments deficit is likely to be well below halflast year&apos;s figure. To ensure that we reach our aim of eliminating the deficit inthe course of next year and of mamtaining the strength of sterling, theGovernment have decided to adopt the following measures.First, expenditure at home. The Government intend to slow down therate of expenditure on capital projects and to defer as far as possible
purchases of equipment and stores by Government Departments, localauthorities and nationalised industries.Housing, schools and hospitals will be contained within their existing programmes. For other non-industrial capital projects for which contracts have not yet been signed, the starting dates will be postponed for six months.Exemptions will be made for projects in development districts and areas of high unemployment. Similarly, purchases of goods will be deferred to themaximum possible extent.All Government Departments have been instructed to carry out this policyand to arrange for other bodies for which they are responsible to do likewise.The nationalised industries will be called on to follow a similar course ofaction.  Local authorities will be asked to follow suit.Loan sanction and grants will only be given to local authority projects which are urgently required. In particular, sanction will not be given exceptin special circumstances to loans for expenditure on land purchases inadvance of requirements, on civic buildings, offices and a variety of miscel-laneous projects which, though desirable in themselves, are not essential atthis time. The expenditure in these categories is now running at  150 million a year.Lending by local authorities on mortgage for house purchase has trebledin England and Wales in the last five years, and in 1964-65 reached 180 million. With the co-operation of the local authorities this will be restricted to the average of the three years ended 31st March, 1965, namely, 130 million.The House will recall that last spring I undertook to review the swollenprogrammes of public expenditure left behind by our predecessors. this review is now complete. As I forecast before the election, the examinationrevealed that it would not be possible to carry out all the programmes weinherited within the limits of our resources until the necessary rate of growth of production has been achieved. We have, accordingly, reshaped the total programme and I can inform the House that from now on expenditure willbe kept to the level that we as a nation can afford. I am giving instructionsto Departments that the 1966-67 Estimates shall be drawn up within a limit which has been determined for each Department within the agreed total.....

All current expenditure on theNational Health Service, net of revenue from charges raised, is included.Current expenditure on goods and services also includes defence expenditureon fixed assets (other than married quarters, ordnance factories and other items with a potential civilian use) and building and construction expenditure overseas.Capital formation comprises all expenditure on fixed assets (with the exceptions noted in the immediately preceding paragraph), net of the proceedsfrom the sale of assets, by the central government, local authorities andcertain other public corporations. An allowance for the increase in thevalue of stocks is also included.Subsidies include the deficit grant paid to the British Railways and Water-ways Boards, all subsidies in support of agriculture and the housing subsidiespaid by the central government and local authorities.Current grants to persons, etc. comprise a wide variety of current transfer payments of which benefits and assistance paid to residents of the UnitedKingdom under the National Insurance and related schemes form the largestsingle item. Also included are awards to students, school meals (net ofparental contributions) and school milk, and grants in support of the current expenditure of the universities, voluntary schools and other private non-profit-making institutions.Current grants abroad consist for the main part of grants to overseas governments under the aid programme. Expenditure on certain UnitedKingdom-based institutions whose activities are directed to the needs of
countries overseas is treated as grants abroad. Military aid, subscriptions&quot; to international organisations and benefits and assistance paid to residentsoverseas are also included.Capital grants to the private sector include building grants to universities and other educational institutions, together with grants in the form ofassistance to industry under, for example, the Local Employment Actsand housing improvement grants by local authorities.Net lending to the private sector consists mainly of loans, net of repay-ments, by local authorities for house purchase. Ship-building loans (net)are also included.Loans to overseas governments. The coverage of this item is self-explanatory.Other lending abroad comprises drawings from the United Kingdomsubscriptions to the International Development Association and loans insupport of projects sponsored by the Commonwealth Development Corporation.TABLE public sector expenditure by spending authority^)(excluding nationalised industries, etc.)  million	1964-65		1965-66	1969-70	Out-turn at out-turn prices (2)	1964 estimate at 1965 Survey prices	Estimate at 1965 Survey price	Central government: Votes (G.B.)        ............

Thus the actual payments of social security benefits are included against either central government Vote-borne (Supply) expenditure or expenditure by the National Insurance Funds,depending upon the type of benefit; the Exchequer contribution to the Fund is however excluded, since this ranks as an internal transfer within the public sector. Similarly all expenditure by local authorities, irrespective of the way in which it is financed, appears against local authorities, while grants by the
central government to local authorities (estimated at  1,300 million in1965-66) are excluded. It follows therefore that, because of these transfersand various other transactions between Departments and the Exchequer, the element of total public expenditure by the central government on Votes willdiffer from the total of the published Estimates.
