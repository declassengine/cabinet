3 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 3511th February, 1966CABINETDEFENCE REVIEW;  THE F. 111A OPTIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for DefenceSince the TSR. 2 was cancelled and an option taken on the F. 111Awe have thoroughly reviewed the requirement for a Canberra replacementin the wider context of the Defence Review,2.      The first step was to establish whether it was necessary to renew the capability for reconnaissance and tactical strike.    The studies haveshown that this capability is essential to meet our reduced responsibilities and commitments.    Though we have made major savings in our defence programme, we are still going to make an important contribution to world peace and stability;  we shall retain obligations to allies and friendsv/hich we must honour.    If we are to fulfil these tasks it would bemilitarily and morally wrong to commit our land, sea, and air forcesunless we had adequate reconnaissance to give us the information we need - not least for political decision - and some tactical strike aircraft to protect our forces from attack.    Indeed, the very existence of thiscapability could well enable us to avoid operations taking place at all.3. The Canberra has been in service since 1952, It has givenexcellent value for money. But its credibility and viability is fastdisappearing. Its performance and age will make it hazardous for operations.    It must be replaced by the end of this decade.4.      The second step was to establish what aircraft is needed to meet these tasks in the light of the choice available to us and taking account ofthe industrial and financial factors.    Most thorough and far-reachingstudies have been carried out.    The conclusion is that we need to makea small purchase of F. 111As for the reasons summarised in the Annex.There is no other way of providing for a Canberra replacement when it isrequired which will not significantly increase the defence budget nowplanned.5.      By placing future reliance on the Anglo/French variable geometryaircraft v/hich it is hoped will come into service in 1974/5 (and is thecornerstone of future European co-operation) we have been able to reducegreatly the number of reconnaissance and tactical strike aircraft we needin the interim.    We inherited a programme of 158 TSR. 23, reduced this last year when the TSR. 2 was cancelled to 110 aircraft, and are nowconcerned with 50 F. 111As only.    Each F. 111A will cost per aircraftconsiderably less than a third of a similar number of TSR. 2s had we continued with this aircraft.6.       The timescale is critical in two senses.    First, in relation to theneed to replace the Canberra - the F. 111A is two to three years ahead ofany of its competitors.    Second, because of the need to avoid any clash with the development of the Anglo/French project.    Indeed, a limitedpurchase of F. 111As will be the best assurance to the French that we intend to go on with the joint aircraft and will have room for it in our   Nfuture programme. copy NO. -
Negotiations with the United States government.      The Arrangement -with the United States Government signed inApril last year gave us an option on up to 110 F. 111A aircraft.    TheDefence and Gversea Policy Committee agreed that when I discussed theprovisional results of the Defence Review with the United StatesGovernment in Washington recently I should open discussions, without commitment, on the terms for the possible purchase of 50 F. 111A aircraft,the aim being to sectire better terms and some reciprocal United Statesaction.    Very substantial progress was made both in Washington and in subsequent negotiations in London.    In brief, the United States Governmentis not only willing to apply the same terms to 50 aircraft as previouslyapplied to 110 aircraft (which the 1965 Arrangement specifically did not require them to do so)  but other significant concessions have beenobtained.   The main features are these;-(a) all the United States aircraft purchases are now covered by a credit of up to $1250m at 4-f per cent interest which is so arranged that payments are deferred and spread at an evenrate over the years until 1977.    The majority of the moneydoes not have to be spent until after 1969/70;(b) the first 10 F, 111As are subject to a ceiling price and theremaining 40 would be bought at the average price applying to aircraft bought by the United States Government who havealready authorised requirements for some 700 aircraft.There is a contingency margin of about  340, 000 per aircraftagainst price escalation;(c) the United States Government has agreed that delivery of all50 aircraft would be completed not later than January, 1970;(d) the United States Government has accepted a target figure of$325m for their purchase over the period of the credit ofBritish defence equipment and a target of $400m for theBritish element of co-operative sales of defence equipment and supplies to other countries of which the initial sale of$200m to Saudi Arabia forms a part.    These targets cover the cost of the F. 111A.    In respect of all reciprocal purchasesthe price differential of the Buy American Act and the temporaryregulations giving a price differential of 50 per cent againstforeign bids in the defence field will be waived;(e) on foreign exchange costs in Germany the United StatesGovernment has agreed to join us in pressing the GermanGovernment to make greater purchases in both the UnitedKingdom and the United States;(f) the United States has also agreed to support us in a NATOburden sharing exercise.8.      I still hope to secure one or tv/o further gains on which discussions are still proceeding,    I will report orally on these.   We should not under-estimate the importance of the concessions that have been obtained.    Wehave been pressing the Americans for many months to agree to firm target, -2-
figures for purchases from Britain but up to now they have refused.Mr. McNarnara has now agreed to substantial targets despite the largereduction in the number of F. 111As we are contemplating and also in thenumber of Phantoms and C. 130&apos;s.    Moreover, the Phantom will now beabout 45 per cent British built and equipped.9.       The reciprocal purchases target will ensure for the first time that we get a foot in the door of the American military market on a strictly competitive basis.    In recent years few British firms have felt it worth while to tender for American contracts but the agreement to waive the present penalising differentials is a major breakthrough v/hich,over the years, could bring us substantial gains.10.      The overall position on foreign exchange for defence equipmentalso shows considerable improvement.    When we cancelled the TSR. 2,the P. 1154 and the HS. 681 the estimated dollar expenditure of thealternative aircraft was put at  1011m not all of it covered by credit,and without taking full account of interest.    An important element in ourthinking then was that the overseas currency bill for buying foreign equip-ment would in practice be offset by the freeing of productive resources inthis country.    It was said at the time that if 40 per cent of the liberatedresources could produce exports or save imports (a very modestproportion for the engineering industry) this would offset the additionaloverseas expenditure.    The foreign exchange cost over the next 10 years is now much reduced as a result of the smaller number of R. N. andR. A,F. aircraft we need to buy as a result of the Defence Review.    It isnow just over  700m (including the interest) with all capital costs coveredby credit arrangements with payments spread over 12 years.    Onlyone fifth of the overseas expenditure v/iil fall in the next four years.11.      The agreements for reciprocal purchase and co-operative salestotal nearly  260m.    The foreign exchange cost of 50 F. 111As includingthe purchase of the aircraft, research and development associated with it,support and running costs over the next 10 years is  235m to which mustbe added  30m for interest,    In more general terms the result of theDefence Review as a whole is. that, broadly speaking, the cost of equipmentpurchases even after including the earlier Polaris deal will be balanced bythe dollar receipts for the reciprocal arrangements described above andthe receipts expected from the expenditure by United States forces stationed in this country.Conclusion12.      The military requirement for some F, 111As is proven.    A smallpurchase will help to keep the way clear for the development and intro-duction of the Anglo/French variable geometry aircraft v/hich is vital to industry and to the future of European co-operation.    As a result of negotiations with the United States Government I believe that we have secured as favourable a position as possible on reciprocal actions by theUnited States and good terms for the aircraft itself.    I recommendtherefore that the Cabinet should -- o-
(a) endorse in principle a decision to buy 50 F. 111A aircraft subjectto the satisfactory outcome of detailed negotiations;(b) agree to this decision being announced in the Defence White paper in the content of the Defence reviewed/ as a v/hole;(c) note that in consultation with the Foreign Secretary and theMinister of Aviation that I propose to inform the FrenchGovernment in confidence of our future aircraft programmeprior to decisions being announced.D.

ANNEX ATHE CANBERRA. REPLACEMENTWhen the TSR2 was cancelled, an option was taken onthe P111A (C(65)57:   C(65)58:    CC(65)21 Item 1) as an insurance policy pending examination, as part of theDefence Review, of the requirement for this type of aircraft and of the possihility of meeting such a require-ment in other ways.2,     The terms of the option gave until 1st January, 1966to take a decision.     When it he came clear last Decemherthat this date would not fit in with final decisions on defence commitments,  the US Secretary of Defense agreedto a postponement of the date to 1st March, 1966.Implications., of the Defence Review3.     During the last year there has heen a most thorough examination of our likely future commitments of the scale and effect or alternative military capabilitiesand the comparative merits of aircraft.     The results havealready heen discussed in some detail hy the Defence and oversea Pelicy Committee.     The following paragraphssummarise the case for the P111A which has emerged froma great weight of effort in a highly complex and technicalfield.h.     Firstly it is clear that, even with the reductions inour future commitments and the level of defence expenditurenow proposed, we shall still have considerable responsibilities and the need to retain a capability to contribute to maintaining the peace worldwide.     To perform their tasksit is essential that our forces should have adequatereconnaissance and tactical strike capability sufficientto provide a deterrent against smaller countries and, ifnecessary,  to deal with their offensive power.     air reconnaissance could hy itself enable the Government toprevent the outbreak of active operations on a small scale,for example hy timely diplomatic action or hy suitabledeployment of forces.     Intelligence studies show that several second or third class powers will have considerable and effective military potential in the 1970&apos;s.      It would therefore he wrong to commit our troops and other forcesin even minor operations without it being manifestly clear to them that we had under our own control the capabilityto deter, or if need te to take out, air attack on them.5.      Secondly, when we are considering our requirements forthe decade 1970-1980, we must not do so exclusively in the context of current preoccupations with Indonesianconfrontation.     Tensions may arise again in Africa.India may call for support against China.     These are justtwo examples.     It is therefore essential that ourtactical aircraft should appear credible to troublemakers and he able to offer the maximum coverage from the airfields likely to he available.6.      It is against this background that the Canberra replace-ment must he selected.     The following points, which shouldhe read in conjunction with the maps in Appendices 1-3?represent a brief summary of the conclusions that havebeen reached:-
c.     only an aircraft with the F111A type .performance at height, including supersonicspeed and ability to take long range obliquephotographs, could meet the reconnaissancetask as a whole;do     provided that we have an element of high quality aircraft within the strike force,it would be acceptable to take the risk of extending the life of the V-bombers (whichcould become available when the RN polaris submarines take over the deterrent role in1968/70) to meet part of the task up to 1975.This would not only reduce costs but would enablus to adopt the Anglo-French VG aircraft (forwhich a Memorandum of Understanding was signed in May last) when it becomes available about1974/5.     This project is intended to be thecornerstone of our policy for collaboration inEurope on which the future of our aircraft industry depends;e,      the advent of the Anglo-French aircraft hassignificantly reduced the number of high quality aircraft that we need to acquire in the short run.     The Air Staff have statedspecifically that they would not want a largepurchase of F111As since the future lies in theAnglo-French development.7. Apart from the F111A there are two other possiblecontenders, the 3pey Mirage and a developed version ofthe Buccaneer.8.     The Spey Mirage would have a performance between theF111A and a developed Buccaneer.     But it has been ruled out because it could not be available before 1970/71 atthe earliest, does not meet the requirement in certain important respects and involves a considerable ( 50M)research and development programme which must be regardedas subject to some risk.     It already seems likely to bethe most costly solution for an aircraft which wouldhave to be largely developed and built in Prance.     TheFrench Government has no requirement for it.9.     As regards a developed version of the Buccaneer:-a.     it would be significantly later than theF111A;    on the basis of a specificallyoptimistic forecast for the development and production of this aircraft, no developedBuccaneers would have been delivered beforethe RAF can expect to receive all its F111As;/b.-2-a. the Canberra needs to be replaced from 1968/69;politically we have given assurances about thetimely re-equipment of our forces;b. there are operational as well as financialadvantages in combining the roles ofreconnaissance and tactical strike in one aircraft;
/industrial ImplicationsId.     it is critically dependent in respect of &quot;bothdelivery dates and performance on thesuccessful development of a new radar by amanufacturer who has no previous experienceof producing a nose radar and putting it into service;c. it could not in practice satisfy the stringentconditions imposed for discreet reconnaissancetasks today, let alone in the 1970s;limitations of height and speed make it unsuitable for this role quite apart from inadequacies ofrange;d. as a tactical strike aircraft it would have inall conditions less than half the range of theP111A (see the maps at Appendices 2 and 3);e. in budgetary terms its provision and support would be more expensive than the F111A, because in the tactical strike role 2 Buccaneers wouldbe needed for 1 F111A, even without makingseparate additional provision for a reconnaissance aircraft wi ich would need tobe of the F111A type;f. even on a 2 to 1 basis the Buccaneer would need to be supplemented with a force of tankeraircraft for flight refuelling;g. the Buccaneer needs longer runways than theF111A (v/hich moreover is not dependent onconcrete);h. a subsonic combination of Buccaneers andV-bombers would consequently be far lesscredible as a conventional deterrent than onemade up of F111A.S and V-bombers.10.   Militarily these arguments are decisive.     The formaladvice given by the Chiefs of Staff is that the F111A isessential.      Indeed we are also advised in the context of the force structure as a whole that the P1127 shouldnot be retained at the expense of the F111A if it provedotherwise impracticable to obtain the P1127 within the approved ceiling of defence expenditure.11.    To sum up so far, the right answer is a two-stagereplacement of the Canberra by:-a. a front line of 36 F111As (compared with the7k projected in C(65)57 and 106 previously)together with the residual V^bombers whichbecome available when they are replaced byPolaris submarines;b. at a later stage from 1974/5 by the Angla-French.VG aircraft in place of the V-bombers.
Industrial Implications12,     The way ahead for the British aircraft industry has become clearer in recent months.     We need a viablebut smaller industry with a much tighter structure;we need the maximum degree of co-operation and joint production;   we need to maintain the requisite degreeof technological and scientific advance.     Leaving on one side such civil projects as the Concord and anyprojected Aerobus, a military programme containing theAnglo-French variable geometry aircraft, the Anglo-French light strike/trainer (the Jaguar; and the P1127should meet these needs.13.     The developed Buccaneer (which like the P1127 isa Hawker-Siddeley project) offers as an airframe notechnological advance nor can there be a prospect offurther development for an aircraft designed in the1950&apos;s.     It could hinder sensible rationalisation ofBAG and HSA, and would mean that we were devoting ourvaluable research and development resources to twostrike aircraft (the Anglo-French VG and the developedBuccaneer) in two different   firms both to be produced inthe first half of the 1970s.     This cannot make sense.Moreover, a developed Buccaneer (like the Spey Mirage)would clash with the Anglo-French project.     We can infact demonstrate to the French that a limited buy ofF111AS is a much better assurance of our intention to goon with the joint VG aircraft than the larger buy ofdeveloped Buccaneers that we should have to make for the tactical strike role alone.Conclusions1h.     It is therefore concluded that:a.     only the F111A will give us in one aircraft and at the right time the manifest military capability we need in the fields ofreconnaissance and tactical strike;&quot;b.     the much reduced buy of F111As now proposed(36 front line) enables us to go ahead withAnglo-French co-operation and does notjeopardise our plans for the aircraftindus try.
Note to Appendices 1-5,.to Annex AN0TP..0N COMPARATIVE RADJUS OF ACTION MIPSIntroductionThis Note and the associated maps compare the basiccapabilities of the F 111A and the developed Buccaneerin terms of range and bombload.     Inevitably they canonly be illustrative.     To make a complete comparisonother factors need to be considered;    accuracy of navigation and bombing;    quality of radar;    vulnerabilitylow-level flight;   flexibility derived from additionalrange.     But the two criteria of range and bombloadare critical ones and form the basis for a reasonablecomparison.20   Appendix 1  illustrates the extensive reconnaissancecover which the p 111A can provide from six of the airfields which we plan to use in the 1970s.3.    The radius of action of the developed Buccaneer hasnot been shown because of its unsuitability for there connaissance role.     The Buccaneer could not be usedin any reconnaissance which brought it near or overdefences of the level which can be encountered now,let alone in the 1970s, because of its limitationsin height,  speed and stand-off photographiccapability.     In other circumstances, and allowing for part of the flight being supersonic, the F 111Arsradius of action is still nearly half as much againas the wholly subsonic Buccaneer.Tactical Strikeho    Examples of the comparative range capabilities of theF 111A and a developed version of the Buccaneer can heseen by reference to the maps at Appendices 2 and 3*Range and bombload capabilities are the same for all ofthe developed versions of the Buccaneer.5.   Appendix 2 shows the extent of the cover over targetareas to the west, North and North-East of the indian ocean which each type of aircraft could provide carrying a10,000 lb bombload.      This bombload has been selected for  .the purposes of comparison since it Is the maximum adeveloped Buccaneer could carry.      The F 111A can in factnormally take 13,000 lbs and with its wings unswept up to3h,000 lbs. &apos;6.   Appendix3 illustrates the cover available from bothaircraft when carrying a 2,000 lb bombload and represents the maximum radius of action of which each aircraft is capable.     This limited weight of conventional weaponswould not normally be operationally profitable when carried by a small force, but still permits strike tasks to becarried out when deep penetration is the requirement./In
2Jo 9In addition this 2,000 lb load equates with the weightof nuclear&quot; weapons which these aircraft could deliver,and consequently the nap also shows the extent of theprotective nuclear umbrella which could be provided,for example, in relation to India.7.    In between these two illustrations which representthe two extremes for the Buccaneer, there is a wide variety of combinations of weapon loads and radii of action,just as there are further performance data for theP 111A up to its maximum bombload of 34,000 lb.     Whererange is not critical, the F 111A affords a significantadvantage in terms of weapon load.      On the   other hand,where maximum range is needed, the P 111A hassignificantly more reserve in hand.     In all circumstances the P 1.11 A has greater flexibility and safety indeployment and operations.Flight Refuelling8.    The range of ?both types of aircraft could be extended by in-flight refuelling.     While there are few areas oflikely operation where this would be necessary with 111As,.it would be necessary to resort to this techniquewith Buccaneers in many situations.     For example, whencarrying 10,000 lb of bombs the F 111A has more than four times the radius of action of the Buccaneer.     Toenable the latter to achieve the same target coverage withthe same b ombload each Buccaneer would have to berefuelled in flight on two or more occasions.     The actualtransfer of fuel in flight is a tried and reliableprocedure but both the Buccaneers and the tankers wouldbe vulnerable when the rendezvous had to be made in hostileair space.     In any event the need to apply this techniqueseveral times to each of a number of aircraft proceeding to attack targets simultaneously in a variety of locationswould require a considerable number of extra tankers whichwould need to be permanently available for this purposealone if a state of readiness was to be sustained aspart of a deterrent deployment.9.    In some situations,  cutting down the Buccaneer&apos;s bomb-load would be an alternative way of increasing the aircraftrange.      However,  this adds to the number of Buccaneersneeded to achieve a given task.     A typical situationStudied during the Defence Review showed that, comparedwith the number of F 111As required, two to four times as many Buccaneers were needed and even then someflight refuelling was still necessary.
