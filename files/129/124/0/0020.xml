US DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 2026th January, 1966LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE - ENGLAND AND WAJLESMemorandum by the Minister of Housing and: LocalGovernmentAt their meeting on 20th January (CC(66) 2nd Conclusions,Minute 2) the Cabinet approved proposals for determining the aggregate of Exchequer assistance to local authorities to yield an increase in grants of the order of  30 million in the first year, and agreed that all or mostof the additional money should be applied specifically to the relief of domestic rates.     Other points raised in my memorandum C(66) i were referred to the Official Committee on Local Government Finance and areport from that Committee is before the Cabinet (C(66) 17).2.       I have had discussions with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, andthe Minister of Transport in an attempt to narrow as far as possible the issues in dispute.     The position, as I understand it, is as follows.Education grant3.       It is agreed that there are no administrative or technicaladvantages in having a separate education grant;  what remains is a straight question of politics.    Will an   education grant equal to only 50per cent of total expenditure - no higher ra,te is possible - be favourablyor unfavourably received?    It is a long way from what v/e promised inour manifesto and the local authorities for the most part view it as a sham.In my opinion a separate grant in these circumstances would be a politicalliability, not an asset.Highways grant on maintenance of roads in county boroughs4.       In C(66) i, the Minister of Transport and I asked the Cabinet toagree to the inclusion of an additional fla.t  5 million in the aggregate of grants in respect of maintenance of highways in county boroughs andInner London (never previously grant-aided).    While we regard the case for this addition as incontrovertible, v/e are prepared, in view of theChancellor&apos;s difficulties, to agree that the  5 million should be found from within the  30 million, if agreement c(an be reached on the other points.Outstanding points5,       Two major points of difficulty remain: -(i)  should the extra assistance to local authorities be reduced becauseconcentrating that assistance on the domestic,ratepayer will increase the net cost to the Exchequer ? and-1-G6COPY NO,
(ii)  if the rate of grant in aid of major improvements to main roadsis kept at 7 5 per cent, must that be at the expense of the new50 per cent capital grants which wo have been proposing tointroduce for other services?Costs to Exchequer of concentrating aid on domestic ratepayer6,       As regards (i), the position is that every  5 million of grantwhich is earmarked for the domestic ratepayer (instead of going to relieve ratepayers at large) will increase the net cost of the scheme tothe Exchequer by about  1 million.     That is because a larger share ofthe rates will be borne by commerce and industry which can claimthem as an expense for tax purposes, and because rates on Crownproperty will be increased.     The Chancellor argues that if, as Ipropose,  25 million is devoted to the domestic ratepayer (leaving 5 million for the maintenance of urban highways) the additional assistance to local authorities must be reduced from about  30 million to about  25 million so that the net cost to the Exchequer may remain unchanged.     This of course would mean that only  20 million would beavailable for the domestic ratepayer.7.       This I find intolerable.    In fixing on something like  30 million as the added money in the first year we were thinking in terms of how much extra, local authorities would get, not of what it would cost theTreasury to give it.    While no formal proposals on this point havebeen jjut to the local authorities, they know that we have been thinkingin terms of an increase in grant of about  30 million in the first year.To come forward now and say that, because the method of distributionnow proposed will cost the Exchequer more, there is to be only  20million for rate relief plus  5 million for highways, would produce avery sharp reaction.Capital grants8,       On (ii) there is, I think, now general agreement that becauseof the high cost and very uneven incidence of major road schemes it is out of the question to reduce the present 75 per cent grant to 50 percent so far as major improvements on main roads are concerned.What is in dispute is whether this necessarily means withdrawing our previous proposal - already put to the local authorities - to introduce50 per cent capital grants for a range of services not at presentreceiving them.     The Chancellor says, in effect, that it does, because he insists that, if the highway grants stay at 75 per cent, there must bea corresponding reduction elsewhere;  and we are agreed that, thoughreducing the other capital grants to 40 per cent v/ould offset the extra cost, this is not a tenable line.    It is 50 per cent or nothing,9.       Retaining the 75 per cent grant would add about  27 million tothe capital grants in the first year, against which there would be somesaving in the revenue grants.     The Chancellor is further afraid thatthe Government would not be able to resist any pressure that might develop over the years to increase the other capital grants to 75 percent.    But most of those in closest contact with local government thinkthat it would be perfectly possible to confine 75 per cent grant tohighways, both for historical reasons and because no other serviceproduces such individually expensive schemes by relatively few localauthorities at any one time. &apos;
Vj*r IM * 1 iff C B^S 1 I       La*10.        It is true that in the discussions local authorities have been waryof the proposed new (50 per cent) capital grants, fearing that these wouldmean increased Government control.    If I find mat they are unenthusiasticabout them, I would not pursue them.    But if in my further discussionsI find that the authorities want to keep them, I do not think we can v/ith-draw them.Conclusion11. So what it comes to is this.    Following our decision that most ofthe extra money going to local government should go to the domesticratepayer, the Chancellor wants to reduce the total because this methodof distribution will cost him more.    And while accepting, as is now agreed, that 75 per cent capital grants must be retained for majorhighway improvements, the Chancellor wants to withdraw the 50 percent capital grants already offered for other services.12,        I think that if I v/ere to put these propositions to the localauthorities the negotiations might break down completely.    We have to remember that our proposals seem to the atithorities completelyinadequate viewed not only against our promise to transfer a substantial part of the burden from rates to taxes, but also against an annual risein rates of the order of 10 per cent.R.
