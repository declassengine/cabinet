CONFIDENTIAL *        181DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY cf HER britannic MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 274th February, 1966UNIVERSITY OF THE AIRMemorandurn by the Lord President of the council the Ministerial Committee on Broadcasting have consideredproposals for the establishment of a University of the Air in the lightthe recommendations of an Advisory Committee convened by theParliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education and science to advise on educational functions and content;an interim report by the Official Committee on Broadcasting on1the means by which a University of the Air might be organised and financed.Functions of the University2.       The Advisory Committee, in brief, has suggested:-(l)     The University should confer its own degrees and have its ownVice-Chancellor and Governing Body, together with Academic Board,Examining Board and Academic Assembly, as well as the necessaryDirector of Studies, Registrar and supporting academic and administrative staff.     It would have its own administrative centre and regional centres and would seek to make use of existing local educational agencies and institutions.     The Central Authority would have its own production facilities, including studios, and retain final responsibility for the planning and production of programmes and courses.(2)    The University should offer primarily courses leading to a degree,but professional, technical, refresher and conversion courses shouldalso be included.     The degree course would be of a general type,extending over four or more years, with the opportunity of obtainingintermediate qualifications at each stage.    Enrolment would be open toall on payment of a registration fee, irrespective of educationalqualifications.(3)     The presentation of courses will variously involve the combination of television, radio, correspondence courses, programmed instruction,tutorials and practicals, short residential courses and study and discussions at community viewing or study centres.    On the basis often main subjects offered, the television time required v/ould be atleast tv/o hours at peak viewing times on five evenings a week for a40-week year, with repeats during the day, early morning, lateevening and at weekends, with additional time for shorter courses.(The Official Committee considered that in all some 14 hours of peakviewing time, and 18 hours off peak time, would be required each week for a 40-week year),-1-CONFIDENT1ALCOPY nc. l j:cabinet(i)(2)
(4)    Departmental responsibility for the University of the Air should rest with the Department of Education and Science.Need for Fourth TV Network3.       The Committee consider that a University of the Air on theabove basis would necessitate the parallel establishment of a fourthtelevision network because there is no other practicable means ofobtaining peak hour transmission on the scale required for the University.Timetable and Coverage4.       From the time of approval, the first transmission on the fourthnetwork might take place within two years, but it would take 8-10 years to attain national coverage.   Some two year s would be required for preparatory work in connection with the University and transmission of Universitycourses might thus start during the academic year 1967-68.    Withinthe areas covered the proportion of the population with suitable setsto receive UP*F in addition to VHF transmissions, might rise from25 per cent in 1968 to 55 per cent by 1970, and over 90 per cent by 1976.It is, however, uncertain how many of the viewers with suitable setswould be prepared to purchase the necessary UKF aerial.    experience with EBC 2 suggests that the present proportion may be between a halfand two-thirds.     The Committee considered that it would be highly desirable to develop a new service as far as possible simultaneously inthe north and south.Cost5.       While emphasising that their estimates were provisional andmight need revision in fee light of discussions with the BBC and ITA,the Official Committee considered that the order of expenditure involvedin establishing and running the University of the Air and a fourthtelevision network shared between the University of the Air and anotherbroadcasting organisation might, in current money values, be as shownin the Annex,Size of Audience6.       It has not been possible to make any valid estimate of the size of the potential &quot;eavesdropping&quot; audience for the University of the Airprogrammes, much less of the number of serious students who mightproceed to degrees or intermediate qualifications.     The audiences for existing educational programmes provide no safe guide.     The AdvisoryCommittee thought that the number of general viewers might be&quot;considerable&quot; but that the proportion who would proceed to degreeswould be &quot;relatively small&quot;.    The Broadcasting Authorities do notconsider that the total viewing audience attracted would be very substantial (figures of 50-100,000 have been mentioned), and its sizewould be restricted by the academic nature of the courses;  by the limitations imposed by the relatively slow spread of the UKF networkand, within that, of the number of households equipped to receive UHFtransmissions;   and, during peak hours, by domestic competition for alternative programmes of entertainment since very few householdshave more than one set (community viewing centres would, however,also be available).I &quot;2- %   -
Source of Finance7.       Since public expenditure considerations alone rule out theestablishment of a foux-th network financed by the Exchequer, thisnetwork must, outside the hours required for transmission of university programmes, be operated by commercial interests, andthe Committee considered how fax- finance from such interests might be invoked to cover the cost of the University also.8.       The ITA are understood to be of the view that a four tlx televisionnetwork, shared with the University of the Air, v/ould earn little or no additional revenue from advertisement, and that the cost of the networkand the University together would be more than enough to absorb thewhole of the programme companies1 present profits before taxation but after payment of the levy.    It therefore seems unlikely that theprogramme companies would have an interest in any scheme whichrelied wholly or mainly on advertising revenue for financing a university of the Air based on the fourth network.    Discussion with the ITA mayindicate the extent (if any) to which some contribution might be made towards the cost of the University (and the Committee considered thatannouncement of the Governments intention to proceed with the fourth,network would give the programme companies a strong inducement toparticipate), but further prolonged negotia.ti.on might be required before a final view could be formed.9.       However, the majority of the Committee are strongly of theview that it would threaten the reputation of the University and imperilits. standards if it were made in any degree dependent on the advertisingrevenue of the authority or programme companies operating the tele-vision network.    Accordingly the majority of the Committee considerthat, while free transmission of the University programmes by theauthority operating the network would be acceptable and necessary,the programme and. administrative - expenses of the University itself should be met from a Fund to which industrialists and foundations suchas ,the Ford Foundation should be invited to contribute;  the balance ofexpenditure, after taking account of receipts from registration fees and profits from sale of books, etei. , would have to be met by the Exchequer.Though noting that the allocations for public expenditure approved bythe Cabinet up to 1970 include no allocation for the University of the Air,the majority of the Committee would consider it unacceptable that theUniversity should be established at the cost of a reduction in existingeducational services.    No estimate can be made of the income likely tobe received from other sources and it is not, therefore, possible toestimate how much, of the running costs of the University ( 5 million to 6 million a year, excluding transmission costs) would fall on theExchequer.Organisation10.       The Committee would prefer to see the fourth network placed under the control of a new Authority and organised on the lines,recommended for Independent Television by the I960 Committee on broadcasting (these recommendations were, broadly, that the authority should itself plan the programmes, sell&apos;.advertising time and purchase the programmes from the programme companies).    The Authority-would be required to provide transmission facilities free of charge to
the University, which would be independent of the Authority.    TheCommittee recognise, however, that there are certain practicaladvantages in allocating the new network to the existing independent television Authority (for example in facilitating the shared use withBBC of a single UPIF transmission system), provided that the independence of the University is guaranteed, and have reached no conclusion pending further discussion between the Cfficial Committee and the ITA.The Next Step11.       Raving regard to the cost of the project, the uncertain extent towhich this would fall on the Exchequer, the absence of any provisionwithin the public expenditure programme, and the impossibility of estimating the likely size of the audience and the number of students, a minority of the Committee thought that consideration should be given tothe possibility of a pilot experiment, using spare hours on existing services.     The majority, however, considered that an experimentalapproach v/ould destroy much of the impact of the University on thepublic and that,  subject to acceptance of its financial implications for public expenditure, the j^roject should be accepted in principle.     Theposition of Treasury Ministers is fully reserved.12.       The Cabinet are invited to decide whether -(I)     because of the public expenditure implications and uncertainty about the size of audience and number of students, furtherconsideration should be given to the possibility of conducting apilot experiment using spare hours on existing services,or whether -the implications of the University for public expenditure shouldbe accepted and a firm intention now be announced to establish a university of the Air on the lines described in paragraph 2 ofthis memorandum, together with a fourth television network,and if so whether negotiations should proceed on the basis thatthe new network would provide free transmission facilities forthe University, but v/ould not otherwise contribute towards itscost.Ii.

But the additional expenditure, i. e. the additional transmitters, equipment,etc. required solely for the fourth network v/ould be con-siderably less than this - probably in the region of  17million.Note 3 This figure for studio and programme costs is based on theassumption that, as on the present independent televisionnetwork, a number of programme companies will in due course use the fourth network, producing several differentprogrammes at the same hours in different regions.-5-CONFSDEMTSAL
