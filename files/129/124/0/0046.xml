CONFIDENTIAL *        3613 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C(66) 46 COPY NO.    fj jj1st March, 1966CABINETCOAL prices memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic affairs at their meeting on 7th October, 1965, the Cabinet (CC(65) 50thMeeting, Minute 2) agreed that the proposals of the National Coal Board(NCB) for increased prices should be submitted to the national board for Prices and Incomes (N3PI) as v/ell as to the Consumers&apos;Councils.    These procedures were to be completed in time for any agreedprice increases to be brought into effect from 1st April, 1966.2.       The National Board for Prices and Incomes have recommendedthat coal prices should be increased to obtain additional revenue of 80 million in 1966/67.    They have also recommended &quot;that the price increases should not be uniform across the country, but that the national coal Board should use the possibilities open to it on varying the price increases so as to reflect more closely the costs of individual areas&quot;.3.       The NCB have proposed price increases totalling  80 million butdistributed (so far as industrial coal is concerned) so that the largestincreases are in the areas with high costs.    The East Midlands is to haveno increase in order to maintain the competitiveness of coal from this field.    Scottish coal, which had a substantial price increase three yearsago, is to increase somewhat less than other high cost areas.4.       So far as domestic house coal is concerned, the only regionaldifferential increase proposed, is that the best grade of coal in scotland should not have the full increase proposed for England and Wales.   Indeed,because of the effect of summer prices, domestic house coal would not increase in price before November in any region.5. The proposed distribution of price increases will still leave theScottish, North Western and South Western (including Wales) coalfieldsmaking an overall loss.Previous proposals.       A similar proposal for differential price increases was before theCabinet last summer but referred to a total increase of  40 million.   Theproposal was discussed in the Economic Development Committee and was reported in my paper C&apos;^65) 120, which concluded:   &quot;The consensus of view was that, if the price increases were approved in principle, it would be right to apply them in the manner suggested by the National Coal Board,which would be consistent with the Board&apos;s objective of concentratingproduction as far as possible on economically viable pits.    But those of us who were opposed to the idea of a price increase at this time thoughtthat our objections were strengthened by the difficulty of reconciling v/ithour regional policies mcxccL .s.0 s of coal prices which would fall particularlyheavily on regions where the need for development was greatest&quot;. &quot;\-ItCONFIDENTIAL
7.       In the event the Cabinet decided to postpone the price increase forthe time being.    We have, hoy/ever, publicly endorsed in the White paper on Fuel Policy (Command 2798, Paragraph 52) the National Coal Board&apos;slong-term aim of making each coalfield self-supporting and securing abetter correlation between prices and costs of the various coalfields andthe various coals.8.       Given the need to raise  80 million rather than  40 million, thepresent proposals by the National Coal Board involving regionaldifferentiation for industrial coal, are consistent with the view taken byEDC last summer.Argument for differential prices9.      It would be possible to increase prices uniformly, or, indeed, toa greater extent in the low cost areas.    In this case the low cost areas would be subsidising the high cost areas.    As a short-term policy or asa regional policy this might appear attractive but it has undesirable long-term effects:-(a) The good pits would tend to price themselves out of the market.The market would therefore shrink in just those areas wherethe coal industry&apos;s long-term prospects are best.(b) The demand for coal from high cost coalfields would be maintained at an artificially high level. There would be an incentive to keep them going and to invest more in them than desirable.In brief, we would be fostering an uneconomic use of resources.10.      If, however, we follow the proposals put forward by the national coal Board we will encourage the use of coal from the low cost fieldsand the redeployment of the industry in accordance with the White paper on Fuel Policy.11.      It is, of course, an inescapable fact that the high cost fields arein the development areas.    It may be argued that a coal price increase in development areas would be contrary to regional policy.    But long-term development in these regions v/ill not be helped by keeping men inexhausted or unprofitable pits.    If we wish to help these areas, the rightway of doing so is by direct government aid and not by taxing theprofitable coalfields to pay for the unprofitable.Re commendation12.      The need to raise  80 million in 1966/67 is set out in the reportof the National Board for Prices and Incomes.    That report indicated thatthe cost position of the coal industry is likely to deteriorate rather thanimprove in the long run and that there is no case for delaying the increasefurther.
13.      The proposed differential price increase for industrial coal(which was also advocated in principle by the NBPI) is necessary forthe future competitiveness of the coal industry.    The proposals forthe scale and distribution of price increases are consistent with previous Cabinet decisions.14.      It is therefore recommended that these proposals of theNational Coal Board and the National Board for Prices and Incomesbe accepted.G.B.Department of Economic Affairs, S.W. 1.1 st March, 1966.3-
