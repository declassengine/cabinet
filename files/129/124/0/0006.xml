C(66) 6 COPY NO.       6 621st January, 1966CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT:  ORGANISATION AND FUNCTIONSNEED FOR A RADICAL review memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentI think the time has come for a radical inquiry into the functions and organisation of local government in England.     This would mean a royal Commission.    The question whether we should appoint such aCommission immediately would need consideration;  timing is discussed in paragraphs 20 to 27 below.    But we need to take a decision now.Inadequacy of the present local government -pattern2,     There are three main reasons, inter-related, why the presentlocal government pattern is inadequate :-(i)  There is no proper relationship between the size of localauthorities and their modern functionsj for a number ofimportant functions the area of the responsible authorityneeds to be substantially larger than is generally envisagedat present.(ii)  The basis of the existing pattern - established at the end ofthe nineteenth century - is a division between town and country, and for some functions this is unsatisfactory.We need to think in terms of what some people call &quot;cityregions&quot;i not regions as big as those now used for centralgovernment purposes (including the economic planning councils) but regions in the sense of wide areas sometimes,though not necessarily, centred on a big town.(iii)  The division between town and country results in a runningfight between the town and the country authorities, theformer trying to extend their boundaries, while the latterresist encroachment.    This is all too apt to mean that thelocal government services are subordinated to the boundaryfight.3*     Size.    Under the Local Government Act, 195 8, a population of100,000 was assumed as warranting county borough status; but this is far too small for education; for planning, roads and traffic? for mainshopping, recreation and entertainment; for the police, fire,ambulance and main drainage services.    All these must be organised on a big scale if we are to get the maximum efficiency.    Meanwhile outof 78 county boroughs in England, there will, after the forthcomingre-organisation in the Black Country (which will slightly reduce thenumber of smaller ones) be 31 with a population even less than 100, 000.-1-CONFED!B&apos;.:\; i:&apos;-i.llS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
4.      Several of the counties are also too small for efficiency.     under present arrangements it is possible to amalgamate counties;  and thishas been done in the case of Huntingdonshire and Peterborough(population 175, 000), and Cambridgeshire and Ely (population 288,000).But local pressure groups are powerful, and Rutland (population 26,000)has survived.1   Moreover, the counties nearly always plan their services in defence against the big towns, instead of in co-operationwith them;  since they are dominated by fear of the encroachment ofthe towns on their areas and rateable values.5.      Below the counties we have a mass of county districts, many ofthem very small indeed.     The county councils are required to review their districts, and can increase their size (reducing their numbers)by amalgamations.    That process is just beginning.    But the countycouncils will be wary of creating large districts.     Quite apart from thefact that they will never allow a county district to get near the countyborough figure if they can help it, there is a level of population (generally60, 000) at which the county district councils can claim to exercise somecounty council functions themselves - and the county councils will try toavoid letting their districts reach this figure.    In any event, whateverhappens on the county reviews, the district councils must always be too small for some functions - e. g. those entailing large scale building and civil engineering, such as housebuilding and sewerage.6.     As a result of these inherent defects in the system genuine localgovernment is being steadily eroded by the creation of ad hoc authoritiesto carry out some of the major services.    The First Secretary has setup regional economic planning councils, nominated by centralgovernment, to advise on regional planning policies.    Their appoint-rnent has underlined the inadequacy of local government to handle the broader planning issues.    The Home Secretary is establishing joint boards as police authorities, where county boroughs and county councils are too small to have an effective force of their own;  or where more effective policing of the area as a whole will come from an amalgamation.The Minister of Transport and I may be driven to do the same thing for planning and transportation.     The Minister of Education has been obliged, because of the inadequacy of local education authority areas,to establish Regional Advisory Councils which, with varying degrees ofeffectiveness, attempt to co-ordinate the provision of technical education.     In the housing field I struggle to establish &quot;consortia&quot; oflocal authorities capable of placing big contracts.7.      I do not suggest that fewer and much larger local authorities isthe simple answer.     The relation of size to function in local governmentis important; but equally important is the way to resolve the conflict between local democracy and efficiency.    Participation by the public in local government may demand, for some purposes, a smaller scaleorganisation than, would result from consideration solely of efficiency.Also there are some services which may be best carried out by smallerlocal authorities.    Al this the Royal Commission would have to consider.-2-
8.      Town and country.     For the planning of land use, for roads and transportation, and for various kinds of major development - the housingof overflow population from the towns, development of industrialestates, main shopping, recreation and entertainment - we need reallybig local government areas, embracing, so far as practicable, bothtown and country.     The present local government system, based as itis (outside the big towns and the conurbations) on relatively small units,cannot begin to grapple with these problems.     Worse than that, it is designed to put every obstacle in the way of their solution.    For eachlocal authority strives to be self-contained - and to the extent that itcannot be, to enlarge its boundaries at the expense of its neighbours.The town councils na/fcurally, though not always rightly, try to providefor the growing population by boundary extension; the county councilsresist this strenuously, wherever it means that a non county boroughmight reach the magic figure of 100, 000.     The green belt - a most valuable conception in preventing the further sprawl of towns alreadybig enough or too big for comfort - is used by county councils to restrain urban growth quite indiscriminately.    Meanwhile the countycouncils cannot easily be persuaded to plan for new   towns of more than100,000 population, since under the present system this will mean that,having spent money on building up such towns, they must in due courselose them, and all their rateable value.     Faced by this situation theCounty Councils Association have asked that the population figure usedto warrant county borough status should be raised to 175, 000; but    v\this, while it would reduce for the time being the threats to the counties, would not cure the basic trouble,9.      In the sphere of transportation, the inappropriateness of the division between town and country led the Crowther Committee (whichwas set up by the previous Government to consider the BuchananReport) to recommend the appointment by the Government of regional development agencies to oversee the whole programme of modernisa-tion in the  &quot;urban regions&quot;,   taking in with the towns the whole oftheir surrounding catchment areas.     The then Government rejected thatrecommendation because it could not be reconciled with the system oflocal government.    But it was none the less valid within its own context.10.     This need to plan the towns together with the surroundingcountryside is now so urgent that I am arranging for a number of sub-regional plans to be prepared by ad hoc methods;    but this process isan unsatisfactory substitute for proper local planning machinery.Meanwhile the Association of Municipal Corporations are trying to getthe co-operation of the County Councils Association in promoting joint action in planning between county borough and councy councils.    Theyhave been moved to this by the threat to local government which they see in the regional economic planning councils.    But even if one could get it, such joint action between authorities which, by their nature,have opposing interests, is bound to be ineffective,   i -11.     One of the problems in considering the pattern of localgovernment is that not all services require areas of the same size, ornecessarily of the same kind.    For some, the present division betweentown and country may be appropriate, provided that the units are bigenough.    Nor is it possible to find a standard pattern which will fitthe different parts of England with their   very different patterns of
town and country.    But it seems to me that the one principle on whichwe can all agree is that we want to sustain a system of local democracyunder which local authorities, singly or in properly related grotips, canbe responsible for the whole range of services which ought to beprovided by elected bodies at some level below the national.     The 3.oyalCommission would have to consider, first which services ought to benational and which local;  second, how the local services could best beprovided for within a coherent system of elected authorities;  and finally how the principles so worked out could be applied in the different parts of the country.    Unless this is done, representative governmentwill increasingly go either the way that hospitals, gas and electricityhave already gone - i, e. into the hands of non-elected bodies!  or intothe hands of indirectly elected joint bodies set up for particular purposes.Local government will cease to have any real significance.Finance12.     If we could carry out a thorough re-organisation of localgovernment, setting up very much larger areas for some of the modern functions, it might be possible to find a source or sources oflocal finance spread over those larger areas, v/hich would enable us to dispense with - or at the least to supplement - the rating system.(This would not, of course, be remitted to the Royal Commission).As a property tax, rates are a regressive form of taxation, bearingmost heavily on those with least capacity to pay;  and while I am seeking to moderate their impact on the domestic  ratepayer in various ways,rates can never be a satisfactory exclusive source of income, apart fromExchequer grants, for financing local services.    At present in order tokeep local government going we have to keep on increasing the exchequer grants.     This alone has the most damaging effect in sapping theindependence of local authorities.- 1 /./vj:j&quot;&apos;The present re-organisation exercis e13.     The re-organisation of local government which is taking place atpresent is ina.dequa.te to meet the needs.    It was initiated by the LocalGovernment Act of 195 8, following consultation between the thenMinister and the associations of local authorities - the purpose of whichwas to elicit the maximum measure of agreement among them about how the existing pattern of local government could be made to match the spread of population.    The growth of population was not then foreseen;nor was the need for regional planning.    A population of 100,000seemed then large enough to support all local government functions,except in the conurbations where the huge concentrations of populationcalled for a different sort of approach.14.     In the country at large this re-organisation means no more thanenlarging the county boroughs to take in their overflow population;creating new ones where non county boroughs have reached or are withinsight of 100,000; reducing smaller county boroughs to non county boroughs (though in no case has this yet been d.one);   amalgamatingsmall counties; amalgamating small districts.    All of this is resistedevery step of the way by all the authorities who stand to lose territory or their identities in the process.-4-CONFIDENTEAL
15.     In the conurbations, a more thoroughgoing exercise was authorised.    Here the functions of local authorities can be re-arranged as well as the areas.    In the result, 19 assorted localauthorities in the Black Country are to be re-organised into 5 county boroughs; and I have announced my intention to create a single countyborough on Tyneside (population 890,000).    (Although it is not aconurbation I have also announced intention to create a single countyborough on Tees-side, population 380,000).    The Local government commission have just announced their draft proposals for re-organisinglocal government in the Manchester and Merseyside conurbations.    Inthe Manchester conurbation these would reduce 60 local authorities toone urban county council and 9 large second tier authorities (on theGreater London pattern).     On Merseyside the existing localgovernment pattern would be retained but simplified by reducing thenumber of smaller authorities;  and it is proposed that a joint planningboard should be established.16,     These conurbation re-organisa.tions can result in a muchsimplified local government pattern, and in big authorities for some services.    But even they do not produce a pattern which gives aswide an area a.s one would wish for planning and transportation, or curesthe division between town and country.17.     Meanwhile the procedure governing this re-organisation isappallingly protracted.    First the Local Government Commissionexamine the present system, area by area, and produce draft proposals.They then discuss these proposals with every local authority and produce final proposals.    These are sent to me and my Inspector musthear the objections at interminable (and very costly) public inquiries -at which every local authority repeats, thorough Counsel, their objections to being amalgamated with others, or to losing territory to others, which they have already put at length to the Commission.Finally I arrive at a decision and later make an order which, in more drastic cases, requires an affirmative resolution in both Houses - and before I can reach that stage the objecting authorities (and most of thernobject) may challenge the order in the Courts.    Nothing has discreditedlocal government more than these long drawn out and very expensivebattles by individual authorities to stay as they are.Reactions to proposal for a radical reviey/18.     I floated the idea that it might be right to embark on a radicalreview of local government at the annual conference of the Associationof Municipal Corporations in September,    The speech was received with surprising acclaim;   and since then many people, both inside and outside local government, have told me that they absolutely agreewith the idea.    Many of the most thoughtful people in local governmentare deeply depressed by its present condition;  which they see asbecoming increasingly ineffective, steadily diminishing in independence and in public respect, progressively failing to attract councillors of adequate quality.-5-CONFIDENTJAL
19.     There is even some welcome for the proposal for a radicalreview among the associations of local authorities, though the municipal corporations would like to see the present exercise - from which their members are gaining - completed first.    The County Councils on theother hand are eager to see the present exercise halted - their members are losing.    But all the associations are greatly disturbed bythe development of ad hoc authorities to which I have referred above.Timing;  and future of current re-organisation exercise20.     If we agree that a radical review of the functions and organisationof local government is needed, we have to consider whether we shouldlaunch this now, or seek to complete some if not all of the still outstanding work under the 195 8 Act.21.     I do not have any doubt that we should carry through to completion those of the Commission^ proposals which have alreadybeen approved, or en which I expect to announce decisions during thenext few months - Tees-side, Tyneside and a series of proposed countyborough extensions in Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and East Anglia.22.     More difficult is the question whether the Local government commission should complete their work (and this is not made easierby the fact that the Chairman has died, and the Deputy Chairman, has just left to become President of the Lands Tribuanl).    As noted above,the Commission have just produced draft proposals for the manchester and Merseyside conurbations; these have followed draft proposals forthe rest of the North-West envisaging extensions of a number ofexisting county boroughs.    It would take the Commission the best partof a year to produce final proposals for the two conurbations, and nearly another to complete the rest of their work on the North-West.After the North-West they have southern and south-east England leftto deal with.    Here they are only just starting, and their work will bemade especially difficult because new cities a,nd major expansions ofexisting towns are in the offing (following the South East Study) thoughit is not yet known precisely where or what size they will be.    Itwould be three years from now before all their work was completed;and at least another two before decisions on their proposals could bereached and implemented.23.     I think the only question we have to consider is whether weshould see through the re-organisation of the Manchester andMerseyside conurbations.    I doubt if it is worth pursuing theextensions of the Lancashire county boroughs - very disheartenedthough they will be if we do not give them the chance to get theirextensions.    Many of them have deputed to me to protest against thepossibility that the Local Government commission s work should not becompleted so far as they are concerned.    But these extensions would entail a prolonged series of bitter fights with Lancashire (who have alsodeputed to urge that we should not take the Commission^ proposals anyfurther);   and to the extent that we felt compelled under the presentrules to accept the proposed extensions they would, taken together withthe conurbation proposals, play havoc with the county.    So, on thewhole, I would not go on with these.    Nor would I let the Commissionstart on the South and South-East.-6-
24.     That leaves the tv/o conurbations.     The proposal for GreaterManchester (see paragraph 15) would be a big step forward;   and several of the county boroughs involved are urging me to go ahead with it.     Indeed I would like to do so.     The proposals for Mersey side on theother hand (including, faut de mieux, a joint board for planning whichcould never be satisfactory) are hardly worth pursuing.    But it wouldbe very difficult to go on with one conurbation and not the other.25.     Moreover if we were to decide to see through the re-organisationof the two conurbations, that would postpone the appointment of a royal Commission for at least tv/o years - until I had announced mydecisions.     We could not be conducting inquiries into these proposals -which would be bitterly opposed by Lancashire and Cheshire CountyCouncils, and also by other authorities - while a Royal Commission wassitting to consider the right shape of local government.26.     So far as the department-tal interest is concerned, I think theright course must be to start the new review now, winding up theLocal Government Commission forthwith.    I have consulted all theMinisters concerned with local government, and they all take thisview.    If we postpone appointment of the Royal Commission we maylose much of the support for a radical review which we have got atpresent.    Meanwhile, local government will become progressivelyweaker.    The Royal Commission could pick up where the LocalGovernment Commission leave off, and make a better job of theNorth-West, taken all round, than can be done under the 195 8 Act.I should be sorry to put off the re-organisation of the Manchesterconurbation, and also to dishearten the Lanca.ch.ire County boroughs;but I am sure that, from the point of view of local government, thearguments for getting on with the new review as fast as we can aredecisive.    But there are political considerations which may point theother way;  and this is a matter which the Cabinet will v/ish to discuss.27.     We should have to legislate for the winding up of the LocalGovernment Commission - whether we decide to do this forthwith or only after they have completed some or all of their Lancashire proposals.This could be done in the Local Government Finance Bill to beintroduced later this session.Procedure and terms of reference of Royal Commission28.     I will suggest terms of reference if it is decided that we should appoint a Royal Commission now.    These should allow for completelyradical proposals,    I have already suggested (paragraph 11) that theCommission should start by considering which services ought to benational and which local; and while this will add to their work and soto the time   they must take, I think it is right that they should beasked to do this.1 1(H  :      :29.     On their procedure and timetable, I am sure that we must ask the Royal Commission to produce a fully worked out scheme.    Ibelieve this will be essential if we are to get,the job done.    We mustnot again get landed with a set of principles which then havelaboriously, area by area, to be applied, while the existing localauthorities fight them every step of the way in a struggle to retain their identities.    This would, certainly, add considerably to the timethe Commission must take - a complete job would take two years atleast.    But a fully worked out scheme would save a great deal of timein the long run.-7-
30.     When we received the final report, we would have - if we accepted the recommendations - to implement them in one comprehensiveBill, settling the broad areas (though no doubt allowing for detailedboundaries to be settled subsequently).    Whatever measure of acceptancethere may be within local government, that a radical re-organisation is required, v/e must be under no illusion that the authorities will, whenit comes to the point, fight any measure which involves theirdisappearance or amalgamation.    But a Government determined onreform could, I believe, get a comprehensive measure through.Scotland and Wales31,     The Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales have been working on local government re-organisation in their respective countries, with a view to producing a more radical re-organisationthan is possible in England under the Local Government Act.      (in wales this followed rejection by the Government of proposals which hadbeen made under the Act, by the Local Government Commission for wales, for a re-grouping of the Welsh counties. )     I understand thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland may wish shortly to propose theinstitution of a high level inquiry:  and that in his view a decision onany such proposal can be taken independently of what we settle for england, since the Scottish local government structure and division of functions between authorities differs greatly from those in England.The Secretary of State for //ales is circulating a separate paper on theposition in &quot;Wales.Conclusion32.     I ask my colleagues to agree that a radical inquiry is needed intothe functions and organisation of local government in England;   and thatthis means a Royal Commission - the terms of reference to be sub-mitted to the Cabinet.33.     If this is agreed, I ask them to consider whether we should appoint the Royal Commission now, winding up the Local government commission forthwith;  or whether v/e should see through the eurrentproposals for the Manchester and Merseyside conurbations - even alsothe proposals for the extensions of the Lancashire county boroughsoutside the conurbati ons.34.     If we appoint the Royal Commission now we might have their recommendations by the summer of 1968.    If we decide to carry throughproposals for the Manchester and Merseyside conurbations, that woulddelay the start of the Royal Commission by perhaps 2 yea.rs, so that wewould not have their recommendations till 1970 (just about the time that proposals for Manchester and Merseyside could be brought into force).If, -in addition, we thought that we must carry through the proposals for extending the Lancashire county boroughs, that might add another year.We could, of course, shelve the whole question of a new review until theLocal Government Commission have finished their job, including theSouth - which would put off a start for at least 5 years;   but I assume that no-one will want that.     Whatever we decide we have to annouce our intentions now - and unless we decide to let the Local government commission finish their course v/e have to legislate now for windingthem up.R, H, S.
