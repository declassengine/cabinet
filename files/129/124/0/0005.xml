CONFIDENTIAL22HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^ GOVERNMENT)C. (66) 5 COPY NO.        6614th January, 1966CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES bill memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of Stateifor Economic affairs in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s Conclusions on 4th November, 1965 (C. C. (65) 57th Conclusions, Minute 5), I have discussed the scope of the proposed legislation with the Trades UnionCongress (T. U. C. ) and Confederation of British Industries (C. B. I. )and a draft Bill has been prepared (copy attached).2.      As a result of discussions with the Law Officers, it has beenpossible to deal with the difficult issue of sanctions in a way whichhas taken much of the sting out of it for the T, U. C.    Although theT, U. C. would clearly have preferred us not to proceed with this legislation, the General Council publicly reaffirmed on 22nd Decemberthe decision taken by Congress at Brighton on 2nd September last toaccept the principle of legislation.3.     My discussions with the T. U, C. have been friendly and helpfuland we have been able to meet their views on a number of points towhich they have attached importance.    For example, the Billrequires the Secretary of State to consult with representatives ofemployers and workpeople before the provisions of Part II are broughtinto force; the appointment of panels of special members for the board is made mandatory; there is no standstill on wage negotiations even ifa claim is referred to the Board; and the Bill will make it possible fora statutory system of notification and standstill to be applied to prices and charges, if that were judged desirable, independently of any actionon pay and terms and conditions of employment.4.     We can properly claim that the Bill in no way impairs therights of unions and the protection they enjoy under the TradeDisputes Acts.    We are not open to any charge of having prejudgedthe report yet to come from the Royal Commission.-1-CONFIDENTIAL
5.      My discussions with the C. B. I. have not yet been carried asfar as those with the T, U. C.    The C. B. I. are inclined to be lessco-operative j?,nd their criticisms of the scope of the Bill are intendedchiefly to emphasise the inappropriateness &quot; in their view - oflegislation.    But many of their criticisms relate effectively to themechanics of a statutory system and the Bill deliberately does not attempt to define these closely in advance of bringing a statutory systeminto force.    I hope to be able to meet the C. B. I. on some points, but we need not be afraid of their criticism of the Bill.6.      The draft of the Bill now circulated is still incomplete incertain respects but these do not relate to matters of basic principle.I will be bringing these other matters before the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Development and I will continue my discussions with theT. U. C. and C. 3. I.     But it is necessary that we should reach agree-ment now that the principles as set out in the draft Bill properlyreflect our previous discussions about the scope of the legislation.I firmly believe they do.     The Bill in its present form is directly in line with the proposals which the Cehinet approved on 1st Septemberlast (C. C. (65) 46th Conclusions, Minute 1) and which were publicly announced on the following day.7.     I do not pretend that the Bill is going to be an easy propositionfor us or that all our friends will be happy about it.    But we are firmlycommitted - a,t home and abroad - to bring in this legislation early inthe present session and failure to do so would do ua serious harm aswell as undermining the voluntary early warning system..8,     Subject to the Cabinet^ broad agreement, and the detailed examination by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Developmentthereafter, I will arrange for the drafting of the Bill to be completedas quickly as possible, in further consultation with the T. U. C. andC. B. I. , so that it may be introduced at the beginning of February.G, B.Department of Economic Affairs, S..W, 1.14th January, 1966-2-CON FIDE NT! AIL

SCHEDULE 2 ,30General Considerations relating to Prices and incomes in the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, Prices and incomes, representatives of the T.U.C. and the employers&apos; organisa-tions have accepted that major objectives of national policy must be:to ensure that British industry is dynamic and that its 35prices are competitive;to raise productivity and efficiency so that real national! output can increase, and to keep increases in wages, salaries and other forms of incomes in line with this increase ;to keep the general level of prices stable. 402. They, have also agreed with the Government^ proposals, setout in the White Paper on Machinery of Prices and Incomes Policy(Cmnd. 2577) that:(i) the National Economic Development Council should keep: under review the general movement of prices and of money 45incomes of all kinds ; and
(ii) a National Board for Prices and Incomes should be setup to examine particular cases in order to advise whetheror not the behaviour of prices or of wages, salaries or othermoney incomes is in the national interest as defined by the5 Government   after consultation   with  Management  and unions.Trends in national productivity3. The figure for the growth of the economy between 1964 and1970 which is being assumed in the preparation of the Governments[0 plan for economic development is 25 per cent. This gives an average annual rate of growth of rather less than 4 per cent. In calculating the long-term annual rate of growth of national production per head of the working population allowance has to be made for thegrowth of the total national output due to increases in the numbers15 of the working population and for short-term variations in the rateof growth which result from fluctuations in the level of demand and the level of employment. The most recent forecasts indicatethat between 1964 and 1970 the labour force may grow, as the resultof the natural increase in the population of working age and the20 continuance of rising trends in the proportions working or seeking work, by no more than Vs per cent, over the whole period. some further increase in the numbers employed should result from themore vigorous regional policies to which the Government is committed.25 4. These assumptions imply an average annual rate of growth in output per head of something approaching 3  per cent. During theearly years of the plan period the underlying rate of growth will inevitably be below the average for the period as a whole ; in addition the rate of increase may be slowed down by reductions in working30 hours and extension of holidays. By comparison the underlying rateof growth per head in the nineteen-fifties averaged about 2 per cent,a year. It is now probably about 3 per cent.Considerations of the national interest5. Against this background the Government have now drawn35 up, after consultation with Management and Unions, a statementof considerations which should be taken into account if the pricing policy of individual enterprises and increases in money incomes areto conform to the national interest and.in particular to achieve the objectives accepted by Management and Unions in the Joint State-40 ment  of  Intent  on Productivity, Prices and Incomes.    these considerations are outlined below. They will help all those concernedwith determining prices and incomes to act in a manner consistent with the national interest:   They are also intended to guide theNational Board for Prices and Incomes in its examination of45 particular cases.Considerations affecting prices6. The development of an effective policy for keeping the general level of prices stable will call for considerable efforts on the partof management generally to increase efficiency, avoid cost increases50,and wherever possible to stabilise or reduce prices.  The rate of
Sch. 2 change of the average level of prices over any period of time is determined by differing movements of a very large number of individual prices. Even when the average level of prices is rising,there are many prices which fall. It would be impossible to lay down detailed rules which would cover all the circumstances which 5individual enterprises face when deciding the prices to ask for their products. On the other hand, unless some general guidance isgiven on the circumstances in which it might be appropriate toraise or reduce prices, there will be no basis for deciding whetherindividual price decisions are consistent with the national objectives. 10The considerations set out in paragraphs 9-10 are for the guidanceof all concerned with the determination of prices.7. It is not intended that the considerations set out in para-graphs 9-10 should inhibit the structural changes that will benecessary in the interests of faster economic growth.   These take 15account of the fact that competition has an important part to play in stimulating economic expansion, and are consistent with the smoothworking of a competitive system.   It should be a normal part ofenterprising business behaviour to increase efficiency, keep down costs and hold prices at a level compatible with its long-term growth. This 20would speed up the replacement of old techniques and out-of-dateequipment by new techniques and modern equipment.   Moreover,the considerations recognise not only that an enterprise must makesufficient profit to secure the capital necessary to meet home and overseas demand, but also that the vigorous and efficient enterprise 25can reasonably expect a higher level of profit than one that is not.8. These considerations apply equally to the prices of goods andof services whether provided by private or public enterprise. TheGovernment regard the nationalised industries as being under thesame obligations as private enterprises to contribute to the general 30objective of price stability, while taking account of their financialand social obligations.Criteria for price behaviour9. To keep the general level of prices stable, it is vital that price increases should be avoided where possible and that prices should 35be reduced wherever circumstances permit.  Enterprises will not beexpected to raise their prices except in the following circumstances:(i) if output per employee cannot be increased sufficiently toallow wages and salaries to increase at a rate consistent with the criteria for incomes stated in paragraph 15 below 40without some increase in prices, and no offsetting reduc-tions can be made in non-labour costs per unit of outputor in the return sought on investment;(ii) if there are unavoidable increases in non-labour costs suchas materials, fuel, services or marketing costs per unit of 45output which cannot be offset by reductions in labour orcapital costs per unit of output or in the return soughton investment;(iii) if there are unavoidable increases in capital costs per unit of output which cannot be offset by reductions in non- 50capital costs per unit of output or in the return soughton investment;
(iv) if, after every effort has been made to reduce costs, the enterprise is unable to secure the capital required to meethome and overseas demand.10- Enterprises will be expected to reduce their prices in the5 following circumstances:(i) if output per employee is increasing faster than the rate of increase in wages and salaries which is consistent with the criteria for incomes stated in paragraph 15 below, andthere are no offsetting and unavoidable increases in non-10 labour costs per unit of output;(ii) if the costs of materials, fuel or services per unit of outputare falling and there are no offsetting and unavoidableincreases in labour or capital costs per unit of output;(iii) if capital costs per unit of output are falling and there are15 no offsetting and unavoidable increases in non-capital costs per unit of output;(iv) if profits are based on excessive market power.Considerations affecting incomes policy11. The development of an effective policy for keeping increases20 in money incomes in line with increases in real national output will call for considerable efforts on the part of unions and manage-ment and all others concerned with the determination of incomes.The object must be to increase productivity and efficiency as rapidly as possible in order to raise real incomes and to avoid,25 wherever possible, increases in money incomes that push up costs and prices.   An important step will be to lay down a &quot; norm&quot;indicating the average rate of annual increase of money incomesper head which is consistent with stability in the general level ofprices.   In present circumstances the appropriate figure for this30 purpose is        per cent.   This would be subject to re-examination by the Government in the light of reviews to be conducted from timeto time by the National Economic Development Council.Employment incomes12. Wages and salaries are determined by many factors, including35 changes in the supply and demand for different kinds of labour,trends in productivity and profits, comparisons with levels or trendsof incomes in other employments and changes in the cost of living.The weight given to these different factors varies with circum-stances.  They are also influenced by the policies which the Govern-40 ment pursue in relation to the distribution of incomes.    TheGovernment in the Joint Statement of Intent on Productivity, prices and Incomes have affirmed that their social objective is to ensurethat the benefits of faster growth are distributed in a way thatsatisfies the claims of social need and justice.   It is in that context45 that the following considerations are set out for the guidance ofall those concerned with the determination of wages and salaries.13. If wages, and salaries per head are to keep in step with thelong-term rate of increase in national productivity, less weight than41 D
hitherto will have to be given to the factors mentioned in para-graph 12 and more weight will have to be given to the incomesnorm. Moreover, in applying the norm to wages and salaries, itwill be necessary to take into account not only increases in wage and salary rates, but also increases in costs resulting from reductions 5in working hours without loss of pay, from higher rates of pay for overtime or shift work and from improvements in fringe benefits.14. It would be impracticable and undesirable to lay downdetailed rules so as to provide an indication of what changes in wages and salaries were warranted case by case.   Nor would it 10be desirable to inhibit the structural changes necessary in theinterests of faster growth.   However, experience has shown that in conditions of full employment the normal processes of collective bargaining both at national and local level can result in pay increases which are inflationary in effect.   It is accordingly important to 15ensure that increases in wages and salaries above the norm shouldbe confined to cases in which exceptional treatment can be shown to be required in the national interest.   These exceptional increases should be kept to a minimum, bearing in mind that they will need to be balanced by lower than average increases to other groups if 20the increase in wages and salaries over the economy as a whole isto be kept within the norm.15. Exceptional pay increases should be confined to the followingcircumstances:(i) where the employees concerned, for example by accepting 25more exacting work or a major change in working practices,make a direct contribution towards increasing productivity in the particular firm or industry. Even in such casessome of the benefit should accrue to the community as awhole in the form of lower prices ; 30(ii) where it is essential in the national interest to secure achange in the distribution of manpower (or to prevent achange which would otherwise take place) and a pay increase would be both necessary and effective for thispurpose; 35(iii) where there is general recognition that existing wage and salary levels are too low to maintain a reasonable standardof living;(iv) where there is widespread recognition that the pay of acertain group of workers has fallen seriously out of line 40with, the level of remuneration for similar work and needs in the national interest to be improved.Other incomes16. Some types of incomes, for example those of farmers andlandlords, are to a considerable extent determined by Government 45policy. The Government will, in accordance with its general objec-tive of price stability, have regard to the fact that increases in incomes of this type have an effect on the prices of goods and services. The income of nationalised industries, local authorities,etc. accrues&apos;directly to the community, but this does not mean that&apos;5t
the prices charged by such undertakings should not be susceptible to the general considerations outlined above. The incomes of self-employed persons are an important category of personal incomes.They differ from those of employees in some respects, and allowance5 must be made for these differences. Nevertheless, those who areresponsible for determining or are capable of influencing the incomes of self-employed persons should be guided by the considerationsrelating to the settlement of incomes and, where appropriate, to the criteria for price behaviour.  Increases in these incomes may there-10 fore be referred to the National Board. The other main category of non-employment incomes is profits, a part of which is distributed in the form of personal income to shareholders. An effective policy for avoiding price increases and securing price reductions wherever possible should ensure that increases in profits arise from increased15 efficiency. Where the growth of profits or dividends is based onexcessive market power this could indicate scope for price reductionsand such cases would be referred to the National Board for prices and Incomes for examination.General considerations20 17. The requirement that total money incomes should rise in line with the growth of real national output does not mean that all formsof income should increase at the same rate. It is necessary not onlyto create the conditions in which essential structural readjustmentscan be carried out smoothly but also to promote social justice.  The25 general review of money incomes of all kinds to be carried out bythe National Economic Development Council will involve not onlythe assembly of the facts about the movement of the main categories of income wages, salaries, income from self-employment, profits(distributed and undistributed) and rent but also an appraisal of30 the way the distribution of the national income is developing underthe impact of the prices and incomes policy. The Government havepledged themselves to use their fiscal powers or other appropriate means to correct any excessive growth in aggregate profits as com-pared with the growth of total wages and salaries, after allowing for35 short-term fluctuations.
