CONFIDENTIAL H , nH      II this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 15 COPY NO._21st January, 1966CABINETBOCAE GOVERNMENT REORGANISATIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for wales agree with the view of the Minister of Housing and &quot;LocalGovernment in C(66) 6 that the time has come for radical reorganisation of local government, but I doubt whether the answer is an inquiry by a royal Commission.2.       The L-ocal Government Commission for Wales, which had been set up under the Local Government Act, 195C, reported in 1962 making certain proposals for the reorganisation of local government in Wales.The Government of the day took the view, however, that its recommen-dations would not provide a fully satisfactory basis for an effectivelocal government structure in Y/ales and undertook to prepare new proposals itself.3.       When I took over responsibility for local government in Wales,I arranged for an interdepartmental Working Party of representativesof the Home Office, Department of Education and Science, Ministry ofHealth and Ministry of Housing and Local Government, as well as of the welsh Office, to produce proposals.    Because I was particularly anxious that they should not work in isolation from the local authorities,I arranged with the Local Authority Associations that a panel of 33people with wide experience of local government in Wales should be nominated to consult informally with the official Working Party.4.       This work is now at an advanced stage.     The panel of localauthority advisers have given their views on the defects of the existing organisation and have made suggestions for remedial action, which theywere agreed was long overdue.     Talcing these suggestions into account,the Yirorking Party have worked out in detail two alternative proposalsfor the reorganisation of local government and these have been put tothe advisers for their observations.    When this stage has been corn-pleted the Working Party will report to me, and I shall be in a positionto put proposals before my colleagues.A Royal commission.       I have had abundant evidence in the last year that the need for local government reorganisation in Wales is recognised to be an urgent necessity.    I have stated on several occasions that the Governmentrecognises this and intends to take action as soon as possible.    Itwould be extremely embarrassing to me, therefore, if proposals were now to be announced which would in any way delay the progress of thework which has already been done on local government reorganisationin &quot;Wales.-1-
Welsh Office, S. W,l.20th January, 1966-2-6.       I appreciate that the Minister of Housing and Local Governmenthas limited his suggestion to a Royal Commission for England,    Indeed,against the background of the detailed proposals on which I am known tobe working it would look odd if we were now to appoint a RoyalCommission to cover Wales as well as England,    Even if, however, theCommission&apos;s terms of reference were limited to England I fear thatthe Local Authority Associations (who cover Wales as well as England)would press mat consideration of any radical proposals for Wales shouldbe postponed until the Royal Commission has made its proposals for england,     This would put back for several years reorganisation in wales, where the multiplicity of weak local authorities is more serious than almost anywhere else.7.       Apart from this consideration, however, I would like to suggest to my colleagues that there would be more general disadvantages inappointing a Royal Commission.     This piece of machinery is widelythought of as being appropriately used where difficult new territory hasto be explored for the first time;   in other applications its use is sus-pected of being a delaying or evasive tactic.    After all the attention that local government reorganisation has received in recent years - forexample the studies by the Acton Society Trust, the Bow Group and theFabian Society, the work done by the Local Government commissions and the experience gained in London, Rutland,  Teeside, Tyneside,Manchester and Merseyside - we can hardly say that this is newterritory which has to be explored by a Royal Commission before, wecan venture into it.    Indeed the Minister of Housing&apos;s paper shows thathe himself is not only fully aware of the problems and their urgency but has a good idea of the kinds of solution that would be appropriate.conclusion.       I submit that the appointment of a Royal Commission would bringthe useful action already in hand in this field to a halt and injure ourreputation as an effective reforming and modernising Party,    It v/ould be better to press on with the work already in hand in Wales and else-where it seems likely to yield good results.    For the rest of thecountry consideration should be given to more direct means, such asthe presentation of a White Paper containing reorganisation proposalswhich, after discussion with the local authorities and other concerned,could be incorporated in a Parliamentary Bill.
