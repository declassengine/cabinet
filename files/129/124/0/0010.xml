confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1966C (66) 10 Copy No.   6 619th January, 1966CABINETURBAN TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTMemorandum by the Minister of transport as a result of their discussion of 7th December last aboutLondon Transport (CC (65) 68th Conclusions, Minute 3) the Cabinetcalled for a Report on specific measures to restrain private traffic in London and to raise a financial contribution for london transport.2. I have considered carefully the Cabinet discussion includingthe possibility of supplementary motor licensing as a means of restraint and raising money for London Transport.3. I see an important difference in supplementary licensing forrestraint and supplementary licensing for revenue.Restraint4. The evidence suggests that a supplementary charge of atleast  50 a year would be needed to restrain road traffic in central london effectively. To be publicly acceptable such a charge wouldhave to be applied selectively so as to be directed to the traffic congestion by which it would be justified, e.g., peak hour carcommuting to inner London.5. The level of charge would be a strong incentive to evasion.New traffic regulations and offences would have to be created. Thiswould mean new legislation, probably in a Road Traffic Bill.6. A workable substantive scheme of restraint bysupplementary licensing would take at least two years to get intooperation (including the necessary legislation). It would be prudent(and probably necessary) to carry out at least one experiment first.This, too, would need legislation.Revenue7. The simplest and most obvious system of supplementarylicensing (and so the quickest to introduce) is one which would apply to all vehicles licensed within a defined area, irrespective ofthe periods of time or purposes for which the vehicle was used.6483
8. It would be necessary to choose some readily defined area(e.g., 5 miles radius of Charing Cross or the Greater London area).There would be anomalies at the boundary.9. A scheme of this comprehensive nature, unrelated to the useof a vehicle at times of congestion or not, could hardly be publiclyacceptable except at modest rates of supplementary charge wellbelow the extra  50 or so which would be necessary for restraint.So the scheme would have virtually no effect on car ownership and use within the area to which it applied. It would be little more thana source of revenue.10. Such a tax might, I suppose, be included in a Finance Billbut a number of important questions would arise in working it out.These would seem to be more a matter for the Chancellor of theExchequer than for me, although there would be important transportimplications of close interest to me.A comprehensive approach needed11. But I think it most important that supplementary licensing,whether for restraint or for revenue, should be considered withinthe context of our urban transport policy as a whole. I am sure thatwe should not present traffic restraint as an end in itself but as one ofthe steps needed to keep traffic moving and enable public transport to operate to the greater comfort and convenience of the travellingpublic.12. I have already announced my intention to present a white paper on Transport this spring. I propose that it should set out thelines of comprehensive policies. On the urban side this will involvemeasures to improve public transport and make it more effective.As part of an integrated policy for urban public transport (particularly for London), there will have to be measures to secure the sensible useof scarce road space, including, for example, tougher parkingcontrols and, perhaps, supplementary licensing. A report of a working group of officials will be ready soon but I am sure that such measures will be publicly acceptable only if they are presented as part of an overall plan for urban traffic and transport that is likely to be effective.13. In the meantime, I am continuing the discussions with theGreater London Council about the scope for extending andintensifying parking control. This can discourage such car commutertraffic as can, without hardship, use public transport. I think publicopinion is ready for this.14.  I will submit my draft White Paper to my colleagues.B. A. C.Ministry of Transport, S.E. 1,17th January, 1966.
