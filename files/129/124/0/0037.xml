LOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCE - ENGLAND AND WALESDRAFT V/HITE paper the problem1.      In 1938/39 the expenditure on revenue account of localauthorities in England and hales came to less than  393 million.At the end of the war - in 19h7/h6 - the total was  5hO million;in 1963/6I4. it approached  2,house million and this year, 1965/66,it may he somewhere near  2,900 million.    It is this dramatic and continuing rise in local expenditure which lies at the root of theproblem of how to finance local government.2.     About a fifth of this expenditure is covered by rents and various local charges;    these produced  h75 million in 1963/6h&quot;The remainder - not so far short of  2,000 million in 1963/6h - isfinanced from two sources, rates and Exchequer grants.   In recentyears grants have met rather more than one-half of this expenditure- a higher proportion than before the war - but even so the amountraised in rates rose from  191 million in 1938/39 to  923 million in 1963/6A and an estimated  1,132 million during the current year.3.     Local authorities are responsible for a wide range of servicesvital to the community.    They include public and personal health;housing and re-development;   education, welfare and child care;police and fire;    land planning and transportation;    provisionfor recreation.   Few people would argue that the scope of these services should be reduced;   on the contrary the demand is forwider-ranging services and for higher standards.   Even to maintainexisting standards would mean steadily rising expenditure as thenumber of those to be cared for grows, and wages and salaries andother costs rise.    To provide better services required continuousdevelopment and ever-increasing staff, and these have to be paid for.1.
CONFIDENTIAL onR4.     Since 1956/57 the amount collected in rates hasincreased by between 9fo and 10$&apos; per annum - much faster thanthe national income - and there is every indication that this process will continue or even accelerate.     This year house-holders will be paying on average  36   8s. in rates, comparedwith  30    12s. in 1963/64;    but as recently as 1956/57 theypaid only  18   13s.     Even so, after allowing for the rapidity&apos;of the rise, the sums involved are hardly large, enough to bea major source of difficulty, if the liability were distributedon any sort of logical principles;    the total collected in house rates is not much more than half the yield of thetobacco duty.     But here, as in other fields, averages concealmore than they reveal;    many householders pay a lot more thanthe average, and others a lot less, and those who pay most are by no means always those who can best afford to do so.5.     The fact is that rates are a crude tax and were neverdesigned to carry the strain now placed upon them;    defectswhich were tolerated so long as the level of taxation remainedlow become progressively less tolerable as the load increases.Under modern conditions the value of a man&apos;s fixed property is no measure of his capacity to pay.     Housing is a necessity,and as with other necessities the poor spend proportionately more on it than the rich.    Consequently rates, which are a tax on housing, are a tax which falls most heavily on those with leastcapacity to bear them.    The Report of the Allen Committee showed that while on average rates took only 2.9$ of disposable house-hold income - income after deduction of income tax, surtax and national insurance contributions - the proportion was 8.2$ forhouseholds with less than  6 a week and 6.2$ for those with morethan  6 but less than  10 a week.     At the same time many who could afford to pay something make no contribution at all;    there arenearly 23 million members of the working population, all of whombenefit from local services; but only &apos;lki million domestic rate-payers and nearly 3s million of those are over retirement age. this might not matter if rates were only one among a number of localrevenues; but they are to all intents and purposes the only tax atthe disposal of local authorities.2.
6.     In addition to being regressive rates have other weaknesses.The basis of assessment is difficult and little understood;    the rent which a hypothetical tenant might be expected to pay in a free market has an air of unreality about it in a world where an increasing proportion of houses are owner-occupied and most ofthe remainder let at regulated or subsidised rents.    Types ofproperty which are never let, such as public utilities, hospitals and universities, have to be assessed by the use of devious formulaein which no great confidence can be placed.    Moreover rates arelacking in natural buoyancy; the yield of income tax or purchase tax automatically grows as incomes or sales increase, but ratingassessments do not adjust themselves to increasing&apos; values and canonly be brought up to date at intervals by a cumbersome process ofrevaluation which makes heavy demands on scarce professional staff.Between revaluations the money needed to meet rising costs and to expand services can only be found by continually increasing therate in the   at which, rates are levied.   And when revaluationdoes take place the changes in the distribution of the rate burden resulting from the correction of accumulated distortionscause a resentment which would probably not have occurred if theprocess of adjustment had been continuouse7.     A tax so difficult to justify could not have survived as ithas without possessing practical advantages.    Kates are cheap to collect once the assessments have been made;    they cannot beevaded;    and they are undeniably local in character.    But the defects of the system are so serious that the Government are convinced that rates in their present form cannot continue forlong as the main source of local revenue, if we are to have athriving and independent local government.    Rates are already a burden to many, in particular to those with small incomes and thosewho for one reason or another spend a large proportion of their income on housing, as many retired people do.    There is an urgent3o
need to bring relief to those who are already hard pressed and toprevent rates continuing to grow at a rate which will make theman intolerable burden to an increasing section of the community,,8.     The Government have made a careful study of possible alternative sources of local revenue with the object of substituting for rates as we know them a new and fairer systemof local taxation.   But they find themselves driven to theconclusion that within the present structure of local government there is no prospect of finding a substitute for rates as themain source of local revenues, or even of supplementing them ona useful scale.    Rates lend themselves to collection by amultiplicity of authorities, because there is no doubt as to the geographical location of the wealth being taxed.    But considerationof other possible sources of revenue, be they taxes on income orconsumption or on leisure activities such as amusements or betting,continually runs up against the fact that present local authorityareas do not make satisfactory taxation units.   This is not onlya matter of size, but also of balance.    Some areas arepredominantly residential or industrial or rural, while others are important commercial centres; people may live in one area and work in another and shop in a third.    In a country as heavilypopulated as this local authority areas can never be self-contained,but larger areas would possess a better balance between different types of development and activity, while a reduction in thenumber of authorities would greatly ease the administrative problems connected with the collection of possible taxes.9.      The outcome of the government&apos;s review of local1governmentfinance so far therefore reinforces the conclusion to which theyhave come on other grounds that there is an urgent need for a comprehensive review of local government.    Plans to set up a royal Commission for this purpose were announced in parliament on Thursday 10th February.    The need to produce financially strong
authorities will clearly be one of the considerations which theCommission will take into account, and the new structure whichemerges from their deliberations should provide a more promisingcontext for further study of the problems of local government finance.10.   Against this background it would be a mistake to introduce a fundamental reshaping of the grants system such as had previously been intended.    The need now is to take such steps as may moderatethe harshness of rates over the next few years without prejudicing the outcome of the wider review, to prop up the present systemrather than radically to reshape it.   The Government have thereforere-examined the possibilities in the light of this short-term objective.11.    There are three directions in which relief to the ratepayermight be sought - (i) by reducing local expenditure, or at leastslowing its growth;    (ii) by changes in the rating systemj    and(iii) by increasing the proportion of local expenditure met fromthe Exchequer.    Or some combination of these might be tried.(i)   Reducing expenditure12.    Local expenditure can only be reduced significantly either by cutting services or by transferring the responsibility for particular services from local to central government.    (Thesuggestion sometimes made that the Exchequer should financeparticular items of expenditure while leaving control locallydoes not represent a real third course, for divided responsibilityof this sort will not work.)   The Government are convinced that theneed is not to lower present standards of service, but to raisethem;    and they emphatically reject the idea that the scope oflocal government should be trimmed to fit its existing financial resources.   As regards proposals for the transfer of servicestheir view is that whether a particular service should be providedcentrally or locally should be decided by asking how it may best be provided, and applying this test they are satisfied that thereis little room for such transfers.
COM 1F1PE INITIAL(ii) Changes in rating13.   For changes in the rating system to be of value in the presentsituation they must be such as can be put into effect quickly.,Irrespective of merits, this effectively rules out the two major changes which have been proposed, rating on the basis of capitalvalues and rating of site values, both of which would involve acomplete revaluation on new principles.    Because of the shortageof valuers and the increasing commitments of the Valuation Officeit is not even possible, as has already been announced, tocomplete a revaluation on the conventional basis before 1973*Ih.    The Rating Bill now before Parliament is designed to providerate rebates for domestic ratepayers of limited means and to giveall domestic ratepayers the right to pay their rates by monthly instalments if they wish;    this will reduce the burden of rates on the poor and help the many who find it difficult to paysubstantial sums every six months.    In the Local government finance Bill, to be introduced shortly, the Government proposefurther to provide for the payment of half rates on propertieswhich remain unoccupied for more than three months.    Thatproperties should remain empty for long periods in conditions ofscarcity is an affront to all right-thinking people.    Making ratespayable on empty property should reduce the present scandalouswaste of accommodation, even though it is unlikely to produce muchby way of revenue.(iii) Exchequer grants15&quot;&apos;   In the short term increasing the proportion of local expenditure met from the exchequer offers the main hope of reducing the burden of rates and the Government have thereforegiven particular attention to this part of the field.   At presentexchequer grants meet rather more than half of the expenditurefinanced from rates and grants, but this proportion is the resultof historical accident rather than any considered approach to theneeds of local government.,
16.    The assistance which local authorities receive falls under three heads;    specific grants (totalling  237 million in1963/6h) j the general grant ( 587 million in 1963/6I4) and rate-deficiency grant ( 11+6 million in 1963/6I4.).    Of these the rate-deficiency grant represents a conscious effort, by no meanswholly successful, to compensate for differences in resourcesbetween local authorities by making good to those whose rateyield per head of population is below the national average thedifference between the local yield and the average.    The purposeof specific grants is to aid or promote the development ofparticular services;    and the general grant, which is the mainvehicle of Exchequer assistance to local authorities,  is merely the successor to a number of grants in aid of particular servicesand the amount of the grant is settled by reference to expenditureon those services (principally education, fire, local health and welfare and child care),17*    In the Government1s view the need now is not so much toencourage or assist the development of particular services as toensure that the total cost of all services does not place an impossible burden on ratepayers and in particular on householders.The best way of securing this is not by a once for all transfer from rates to taxes, which would mean a rate holiday followedby a resumption of the previous steeply rising trend, but by a progressive increase in the proportion of expenditure met fromgrants.The Government&apos; s propjo^sals18,   with this in mind the Government propose that for 1967/68and subsequent years a new system should operate under whichthe first step would be to determine the total assistance to begiven from the Exchequer to local government.    Local authorities would be asked to submit estimates of expenditure for thefollowing two years and these would be examined in the light of ,N
the need to develop services and of the Government&apos;s declared aim off containing the growth of public expenditure.    In this way anestimate of total expenditure would be built up and a grant total would be derived, from this by applying a percentage risingsteadily from year to year.    The aim would be to keep the average increase in rate poundages broadly in line with the growth ofthe economy, as measured by gross domestic product.19.   The result would be to increase the total of Exchequer grants to local authorities in England and Wales in 1967/68 by something approaching  30 million over and above what would have beenpayable if the present system had continued!    the increase wouldbe approximately  60 million in the second year,  90 million inthe third, and so on.   The annual increase would be equal toabout one quarter of the additional sum which local authorities will on present trends have to find;    and the amount needing tobe raised in rates would be reduced by the same amount.20.    The Government propose to devote the great part of this additional grant to reducing the rates of householders who,unlike commercial and industrial undertakings,  cannot claim their rates as an expense for tax purposes.    Assuming that the totalcollected in rates continues to grow by about 10^ per annum, theresult on average should be that the increase in rates whichhouseholders are called on to bear in 1967/68 and subsequent years will be only about one-half of what it otherwise would have been.Averages are, of course, misleading:    in some areas the increase which householders are left to face may be very small indeed;but even where the growth of rates is above average householdersshould benefit to the extent of about a 3d. rate in the first year, twice that in the second and so on.21.,   The remainder of the grant total will be distributed partly in the form of specific grants related to the expenditure of individual local authorities and partly by way of a new grant in.
aid of the rates generally.    Specific grants will be retained for services where the incidence of expenditure is very uneven;coast protection is an extreme example.    fcow grants of this typewill be introduced to assist urban redevelopment, the reclamationof derelict land and the acquisition of public open space.    Thepresent police grant will also be retained, in view of the special responsibility of the Secretary of State for Home Affairs in this field.22,    The new rate support grant will, however, be the main channel of Exchequer aid to local government;    it is expected to distribute at least 80S. of the total grant.    This grant will replace the present general and rate-deficiency grants and some existingspecific grants; the larger part of it will be distributed to the major authorities on the basis of demographic and environmentalfactors,  of which the most important will be population and thenumbers of pupils and students at different stages of education;the remainder will be distributed to all authorities with belowaverage rate resources on lines similar to those of the present rate-deficiency grant.23.    These proposals are not presented as a long-term solution;they would be quite inadequate as such.    Their purpose is toreduce the burden of rates and produce a fairer distribution of exchequer assistance among local authorities, and so to shore upthe shaky edifice of local government finance until there hasbeen time to re-examine the whole position in the light of whatever conclusions emerge from the work of the Royal Commissionon Local Government,9.
