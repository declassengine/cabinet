5 DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 4325th February, 1966CABINETCOMPREHENSIVE REORGANISATION AND raising of THE SCHOOL LEAVING .AGEM em o r andum by the Sec rotary of State for education and science think my colleagues should be aware of certain problems in thefield of school reorganisation which may give rise to controversy and difficulties in various parts of the co^^ntx,&apos;y.     &quot;We initiated last year there organisation of secondary schools on comprehensive lines, but without providing any money for it.     We inherited from our predecessorsa commitment to raise the leaving age to 16 in 1971 and I do not regard it as either politically or educationally possible to postpone this reform.The school population is growing rapidly.    We have provided in theNational Plan for larger building programmes than in the past but thiswill only accommodate extra numbers and do little or nothing to improve the old schools.    Moreover, there are already signs that some localeducation authorities are not going to find it easy to build at the rateenvisaged in the Plan.2.      A strong minority of local education authorities would much prefer to be allowed to make their plans on the basis of a different age of transfer from the primary to the secondary stage either because they(rightly) dislike the 11-13 schools which comprehensive planning on thebasis of the present age of transfer forces upon them;  and/or because a different age would, in their particular circumstances, allow a more economical use of buildings and teachers.3.      I therefore propose (without any public fuss) to permit those authorities who can show me that a different age of transfer from 11would produce an educationally better comprehensive system and a more economic use of buildings, to adopt what they consider the mostsensible age.    A period of diversity throughout the country is in anycase inevitable for some years while reorganisations proceeds, and indeed I have an open mind on whether in the long run it would provedisadvantageous.4.      This decision will ease my troublesome relations with theCentral Advisory Council (England) under the chairmanship ofLady Plowden, which was appointed by the px*previous Governmert to.review primary education and the age of transfer to secondary schools and is likely to report in July or the autumn.     On present indicationsthe Council will recommend an eventual change to 12-plus with an interim period of local option.    I could not possibly accept this after66COPY NO.     u u-1-
^mjcmcMTiAithe Council had reported in the autumn; for comprehensive schemes are due -to be in to me by July, and to announce a change in the age of transfer in the autumn would therefore make a farce of the wholecomprehensive operation.    But to permit a limited degree of localoption now will avoid a clash with the Plowden recommendation, whenit comes.5.     I ask my colleagues to note that I intend to go ahead withcomprehensive reorganisation and the raising of the school-lea. ving age and to allow local variation in ages of transfer where this will make thebest use of existing resources and produce the best educational results.C.
