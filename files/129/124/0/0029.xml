CONFIDENTIAL 1        iggIS DOCUMENT IS THE PRC PERT Y OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(6S) 29 COPY NO.    66Sth February, 1966CABINETLEASEHOLD REFORMSMemorandum by the Lord President of the CouncilPrevious consideration the Cabinet considered on 23rd December (CC(65) 73rdConclusions, Minute 2) proposals for leasehold reform, the principal features of which were mat holders of long leases purchased or inheritedwith more than 21 years to run would be entitled to the extension of the lease to 999 years and to enfranchise at the market value of the free-holder    interest as depreciated by the extension.    Holders of leasespurchased with less than 21 years to run would have a right toenfranchise at the market value, but with a statutory tenancy instead ofan extension of the lease.    The Cabinet considered that these proposals,and in particular the 999 year lease, were too confiscatory in effect and invited the Ministerial Committee to examine the problem again withparticular regard to the need to give security and stability to the leaseholder who had occupied his house for a long time, to the desira-bility of providing; a shorter extension cf the lease and to means ofproviding a fair price for enfranchisement.     The scheme should ifpossible, be such that it could be applied against local authorities.New proposals.       The Committee have considered a number of proposals andhave agreed, subject to reservations by the Lord Chancellor and the attorney-General, to recommend the following scheme:(l)     QualificationA qualified leaseholder should be one who(a) holds a lease, originally granted for more than 21 years, ata ground rent, of a house below Rent Act limits of rateable value;(b) has occupied the house as his residence for at least fiveyears.leaseholders whose leases have expired since Sth December,1964, and are still occupying on a statutory tenancy would benefit from the scheme. ,
(2)    Extension of leaseA qualified leaseholder should have the right to an extension of the lease by 5C) years, with no right to a further extension thereafter,at a full modern ground rent which would be further reviewedafter 25 years of the extension.(3)    EnfranchisementA qualified leaseholder will also have the right to enfranchise hislease at any time when he is qualified, on payment to the free-holder of the market value of the freeholder&apos;s interest asdepreciated by tins extension, excluding any development value,which should be dealt with separately.The effect of these proposals as compared with prices paid forenfranchisement in different parts of the country in recent years is shown in the Annex.The sale of the freehold, interest will in any case have to be reported to the Land Commission so that they may determine whether there is development value in the site.    If they do so,there should be added to the price of enfranchisement the valueof the freeholder^ development rights as they exist at the timeof enfranchisement, i. e. not the full potential development valuebut that value blanketed&apos; by the unexpired period of the lease.The freeholder would pay levy on mis sura.(4)    Plights reserved to the freeholder(i)  During the original lease the freeholder should have the rightto resist in the county court either enfranchisement or theextension of the lease on the ground that he wants the propertyfor occupation by himself or his family and would suffer greaterhardship from inability to recover possession than would the leaseholder from inability to exercise his rights under thescheme.    If he succeeds he pays to the leaseholder the value ofthe extended leasehold interest to which the leaseholder would otherwise have been entitled.(ii)  During the extension the freeholder should, on cause shown,have the right to obtain possession for redevelopment compulsorilyby buying out the extended lease.The case for these proposals3.       These proposals seem to the Committee to have the following advantages:-(i)   The principle underlying the policy of leasehold enfranchisementis that in equity the bricks and mortar belong to the qualified leaseholderand the land to the freeholder.     The 50 year extension of lease effectivelyseparates these interests.     The market value of the freeholder^interest in a lease with 50 years or more to run cannot include anythingfor the reversionary value of the bricks and mortar.    At the same time,-2-
if he is given the right to a fully modernised ground rent after the expiry of the present lease, he is not being deprived of any of the reversionaryvalue of the land.    Market value depreciated by such an extension of leaseis therefore bound to yield a fair price fox- enfranchisement, giving thefreeholder neither more nor less than the value of his interest in theland for existing use.    This, plus &quot;blanketed1 development value, if any,can be confidently defended as fair treatment for the freeholder once theprinciple on which we are working is accepted as equitable.(ii)  The price will in the great majority of cases be less than themarket value which the freeholder^ interest has under the existing law.It will sometimes be the same (e.g. where the reversion is still toodistant to affect market value);  but it can never be more.    (The ti*oublev/ith various formulae we examined for capitalising updated ground rentwas that they either produced a price much higher in many cases thanpresent market values, or^a price which in many cases confiscated someof the value of the land, or both. )(iii) The scheme is less ccnfiscatory than the original proposals,because the freeholder will not be deprived of any &apos;blanketed! development value there may be.    In so far as he gets less than what his interest isworth under the present law, the difference represents the loss of thereversionary value of the bricks and mortar;  and this is a form ofConfiscation&apos; which v/e are prepared to defend on principle.(iv) To give an extension of 50 years, rather than an extension to 999years, looks better presentationally, since 999 years is excessive as ameasure of protection for the leaseholder in his home, and the shorterextension will not interfere so much with desirable redevelopment.(v)  By treating development value separately and increasing the qualifying period of residence from three to five years, the scheme goesfurther towards discouraging speculators and, in the view of the majorityof the Committee, makes it possible to abandon the distinction in theoriginal proposals between leaseholders who bought leases with more than21 years to run and those who bought v/ith less.    This distinction has hadno place in our public discussion of enfranchisement and most of us onreconsideration see considerable objections to it.4.       The scheme will undeniably make some demand on the servicesof valuers, but we think that the demand will be limited by the fact that once a price, or a modernised ground rent, has been agreed for oneproperty in an area it is probable that a similar price will be accepted for similar properties.    We would expect that prices would normally be negotiated without difficulty and that few cases would have to go to any formof arbitration.Minority view5.       In the view of a minority of the Committee, it goes too far to saythat in equity the bricks and mortar belong entirely to the qualified lease-holder in all cases.    They accept this for leaseholders who acquired (byptirchase or inheritance) a long tenure of the house, but hold that if the leaseholder only came on the scene late in the life of the lease, paying forthis short-term interest a price much lower than bricks-and-mortar value,he cannot be said in equity to have acquired a title to the full value of the
bricks and mortar in perpetuity.    They therefore propose, as a variant ofthe bricks-and-mcrtar principle, that the price paid by the leaseholderfor enfranchisement should vary according tc the length of leasehold tenurewhich he originally bought.    If this principle were accepted, it could bemade effective by making the price of enfranchisement the market valueof the freeholder^ interest depreciated by the assumption that at the dateof enfranchisement the lease still has as long to run as it had when the leaseholder acquired his leasehold interest.    In effect, this means thaton enfranchisement he pays so much of the value of the fee simple as he did not buy before (because it was not then for sale).    This can never bemore than the value of the freeholder^ interest under the present lav/, andin the case of leaseholders who came on the   scene   when the lease stillhad many years to run, it naturally yields the same result   as themajority proposal.Public Authorities6.       Not the least of the advantages of the scheme now proposed by themajority of the Committee is that they believe that it can be madeacceptable to public authorities.     We propose that in relation to public authorities the scheme should be subject to the following modifications(i)  Land Commission.     Where a lease is held on crown hold terms     .the covenants would continue to operate so that the freeholdwould also be on crown hold terms, and the Commission would retain all development value.(ii)  Local authorities.    Leaseholders enfranchising against a localauthority should be debarred from acquiring development rights.If the authority wanted later to acquire the site for development the compensation would thus not include development value.Where the local authority had acquired land for early development the Minister of Housing and Local Government should have discretion to forbid enfranchisement, since it would be absurdthat the leaseholder should be able to enfranchise only to havethe property compulsorily purchased soon afterwards.(iii)  Universities.    Leaseholders holding from universities and other public authorities should be put in a similar position to thoseholding from local authorities.(*v)  Crown,Estate and National Trust.     Land held inalienably by theNational Trust and land leased by the Crown Estate and theNational Trust on special terms designed tc ensure thepreservation of houses and land of special architectural,historic or amenity value to be excluded from the scheme.(v) Housing associations to be excluded on the ground that it is contrary to the nature of a housing association that its members should be able to enfranchise against it.(vi)  Royal Duchies to be excluded from the statute, but to allowenfranchisement voluntarily on the terms applied to privatefreeholders.- 4-CON FIDE NTS AL
g**Ki ui r*e KITIAIConclusion7.       Subject to reservations on the subject of leases bought with lessthan 21 years to run, the Ministerial Committee believe that the scheme outlined above effectively fulfils our pledge &quot;to enable householders withan original lease of more than 21 years to buy their own houses on fairterms&quot;;  that it is no more confiscatory than is necessary to achieve our purpose of transferring the reversionary value of the bricks and mortarfrom the freeholder to the leaseholder;  that it meets the needs of lease-holders in Wales for relatively cheap enfranchisement or security of tenure;  and that it can be explained and defended in the country and inParliament.8.      If the proposals are approved we propose   that a White Paper shouldbe submitted to the Cabinet next week with a view to publication in timeto be debated in the House of Commons on 24th or 28th February.    hi themeantime the Ministers concerned will continue to work out matters of detail such as the arrangements for preserving covenants, and the drafting of the Bill can be put in hand.9.       We accordingly ask the Cabinet to approve proposals that -(i) holders of long leases who have lived in the property for 5 years should be entitled -(a) to an extension of the lease for 50 years at amodernised ground rent, subject to reviewafter running for 25 years;(b) to enfranchise at the market value of the freeholder^interest as depreciated by the extension, development value, if any, to be purchased separately as&quot;blanketed1 value;(ii)  the freeholder should have the rights -(a) to oppose extension or enfranchisement on the groundthat&apos;he wishes to occupy himself and would suffer&quot;greater hardship&quot;;(b) to re occupy for redevelopment during the extensionon payment of compensation;(iii)  the scheme should apply to public authorities subject to the modifications indicated in paragraph 5 above.K.
