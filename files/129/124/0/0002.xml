THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT-Printed for the Cabinet.   hinuaryl966    -Copy No.     6 6CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT finance memorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerUnder the proposals for the new system of financial help tolocal authorities which the Cabinet approved on 16th September(C.C. (65) 48th Conclusions, Minute 1), the new benefits, to the localauthorities and the extra charges on the Votes of Departments were:(a) about  100 million net of extra capital grants at 50 per centin the first year (1967-68), the amount rising steadily overthe years; and(b) about  30 million of extra revenue grants in the first year(1967-68),  60 million in the second,  90 million in thethird and  120 million in the fourth (1970-71). This is thescale of transfer required to keep the growth of the rate burden in step with Gross National Product (GNP).These benefits (and charges on the Exchequer) are additional to the rapid growth of the grants under the existing system. In 1967-68,the Exchequer will anyway be finding an increase of about  130million and in 1970-71 of  630 million above 1966-67. These figuresbecome  160 million for the 1967-68 increase and  750 million forthe 1970-71 increase under the new scheme.2. Of the proposals in paragraph 16 of C (66) 1, (2) and (3) areconcerned with the distribution of benefit, and (1) and (4) with thetotal charge which the Exchequer is to accept. Taking (1) and (4)first, I agree that the aggregate of Exchequer assistance on the revenueside should increase by about  30 million in the first year and  60million in the second. I also agree that the new grant should be expressed as a rising percentage of total approved expenditure, the precise percentages to be worked out by officials, taking account ofthe likely trend of price increases, so as to implement the addition of 30 million and  60 million. However, I cannot agree to the proposals in (4) on highways.C(66)212th January, 19666469
3.  I would summarise the difficulties about a 75 per cent rateof capital grant for Class I or &quot; main &quot;roads as follows:(i) The extra cost of capital grants in 1967-68 would become 130 million instead of  100 million with bigger differences in later years as the road programme grew.(ii) Under the new scheme, neither 50 per cent nor 75 per cent for capital grant represents the real limit of exchequer cost or local authority benefit in respect of investment.Whereas at present 75 per cent of cost is the full amountof the Exchequer charge for a Class I road (except forthe minority of local authorities which get Rate DeficiencyGrant), under the new scheme the loan chargesrepresenting the balance not covered by the capital grantwill qualify for the Exchequer revenue grant at somefigure between 50 per cent and 60 per cent. The total amount from the Exchequer with a 50 per cent capitalgrant will therefore be about 78 per cent and with a75 per cent capital grant, would be about 89 per cent.75 per cent capital grant for highways under the new system would therefore go far beyond what the Exchequernow contributes with the present 75 per cent grant. It istrue that the individual local authority gets the extramoney in a form which is not specially identified withhighway expenditure, but that does not alter the fact thatthe Exchequer is having to find it. 89 per cent payment- v . . . for the Exchequer in respect of highways expenditure goes,in my view, much too far.        ;    ..(iii) 75 per cent for highways would carry a real risk ofrepercussion on the other 50 per cent capital grants under&apos; &quot; &apos; the new scheme. There are other services (e.g., teacher training colleges) which are no less&quot; National &quot; than roads and sooner or later there would be pressure for extension.    -       of the 75 per cent rate.    ,.. ..4. . A. capital grant of 75 per cent for roads cannot be considered in isolation, for it would fundamentally alter the capital grants sideof the plan. The new capital grants and 50 per cent for highwayswere part of a package. A reversion to 75 per cent on highways upsetsthe balance: the capital grants become too costly and I doubt whetherother services will be satisfied with less. If we decide to retain a 75per cent grant for roads, the whole capital grants plan will need tobe reconsidered. -; - 5. I cannot; agree to the suggested once-for-all addition of 5 million to the total Exchequer assistance in respect of highwaymaintenance in county boroughs. The total Exchequer contributionmust be determined by the broad principle of.bringing the growth of rates more nearly into line with growth of Gross domestic product (GDP), and by the percentage rate which is agreed to be needed to achieve this. This is really a question of the distribution, ONFJDENTIAL
within a total Rate Support Grant of well over  400 million, of the 30 million,  60 million, etc., of extra benefit which it is agreed thescheme should provide. There could be no objection to distributing 5 million of the  400 million by reference to highway factors if mycolleagues are agreed on this; and the suggestion in paragraph of C (66) 1 that a sum less than  30 million should be distributed to domestic ratepayers fits in with this.Education6. I think my colleagues will want to examine closely thearguments for getting rid of a separate education grant. All of us have argued in the past that a separate grant is essential forlong-term planning in education and so far I am still of that view.Domestic ratepayers7. There is a great deal to be said for concentrating a large part of the extra benefit of the new scheme on the domesticratepayer as a means of making a bigger impact on the domesticrate burden. Even so I must draw my colleagues&apos; attention to certaindangers of this course:(a) The principle underlying the scheme of keeping the growth of rates in line with the growth of incomes would berobbed of most of its meaning. Domestic rates would rise more slowly than GDP, industry&apos;s rates would growfaster than GDP. As a result, there would be no particular logic about the degree of domestic derating.(b) Derating domestic ratepayers is equivalent to superratingindustry. Such a policy of increasing costs to industry would look odd at a time when we were introducinginvestment grants, and would seem particularly strangein development districts. The Secretary of State forScotland recently announced the continuance ofindustrial derating in Scotland. Industry would undoubtedly protest and might quote this new policy inarguments about price increases.(c) Derating damages rates as a source of revenue. It is not longsince industrial derating ended in England and Wales.We cannot afford to impair a tax which still yields 1,200 million until we have something to put in its place and there is nothing in sight yet.(d) Concentrating part of the  30 million on domestic ratepayersincreases the net cost to the Exchequer, since industryis left with more rates qualifying for tax relief.8. Therefore there are serious objections to embarking on apolicy of domestic derating, with no particular principle to guide usin doing so.GONFIDE^TIAL
conclusions .- (a) If it is now thought that the highways capital grantcannot be reduced to 50 per cent, we must reconsider:l the whole of the capital grants part of the scheme. Andthe  5 million in respect of highways maintenance in county boroughs should come out of the sum of 400 million for rate support.(b) We should, in my view, retain a separate education grant.(c) To lessen the risks in embarking on domestic derating weshould find some principle to guide us for the future.(d) The amendments which are proposed, both for capital grants and for current grants, are so fundamental that ineffect they would constitute a new scheme, the implications of which need more consideration.L.
