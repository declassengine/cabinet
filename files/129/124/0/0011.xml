:(66) 11:opy NO. 66ICth January, 1966CABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE;  1966-67 ESTIMATESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Public Expenditure Committee, having considered the general position on Estimates 1966-67, has been reviewing some of theDepartmental Estimates for that year.    The Defence Budget has been settled, apart from the pay increa.seat about the same money figure as last year i0e.   2, 120 million.    The figiirec for the major civilprogrammes are based on the public expenditure programme which was approved by the Cabinet at its meetings on 29th July, 1965 (C. C, (65) 43rdConclusions, Minute 3) and 5th August, 1965 (C.C(65) 45th Conclusions,Minute 2).    The actual figures have, of course, been affected by the deferment of certain capital expenditure which was agreed by the Cabineton 27th July (C. C.(65) 41st Conclusions) and also by changes in pay and prices since the public expenditure programme was prepared.2.       The programme covered by these decisions represent the great bulk of public expenditure.    The remaining items were not suitable for treatment in quite the same way, but have been pruned with the samestandards of stringency.    The only questions which I had to refer to thePublic Expenditure Committee were the Space Programme, andexpenditure on overseas information, overseas representation, andmilitary aid.    The Committee has discussed these items with the Ministerof Aviation, the Minister of State, Foreign Office and the parliamentary secretaries to the Commonwealth Relations Office, Ministry of overseas development, and Ministry of Public Building and Works.    The viewsreached by the Committee are set out in the Annexes to this paper.    (TheForeign Secretary, though a member of the Committee, was abroad at thetime of the meetings and reserves his position on the recommendations.)3.       The departmental proposals for these items exceed  100 million.Moreover they are all programmes in which a large proportion of thetotal cost involves expenditure overseas.    In view of our balance ofpayments difficulties it is particularly important to make every possibleeconomy overseas in expenditure by the Government.    It is for thisreason, as v/ell as the importance of keeping the growth of public expenditure under close control, that the Committee would strongly recommend our colleagues to agree to our proposals for further reductions in these Estimates as set out in the Annexes.\ i4,       In brief our recommendations are a.s follows:-EUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION (ELPO).Provision in the Estimates should be restricted tc  8 million, theprobable cost in 1966-67 on the basis of terminating our commit-ment in March, 1966, as against  12 million if we had notdecided to do this: the possibility would be kept open of a supplementary Estimate in the light of the March meeting.-1-SECRETHIS DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
B.L.A3K ARRO&apos;.&apos;/. Provision should bo made for the programme to go ahead at a cost in 1966-67 of  2.35 million, including associatedsatellite technology contracts.OVERSEAS INFORMATION. Provision should be  30.6 million: 1 million above 1965-66 Estimates but  2 million less thanDepartments have proposed.DEFENCE AID.    Only token provision should be made for the svipply ofa frigate to India.    Provision  or military training etc. for commonwealth countries should be held to  3 million:  8 per cent above 1965-66 Estimates but 10 per cent less than has been proposed by Departments.    Provision for assistance to Malaysia,should be restricted to the realistic cash requirement on existing commitments.    In these Votes, the saying would bo  1.6 million on a. total of  22.9 million.OVERSEAS REPRESENTATION.    The maximum possible economiesshould be made in the representational element (about  36 million)of the Diplomatic Service Estimate and particularly in building work overseas (on which  10 million is proposed, of which 6 million on capital expenditure, much of which is already inprogress): the Ministers concerned are to make proposals.5.       If the Committee&apos;s proposals are accepted I hope it will be possibleto keep the money increase in total Estimates over last year within aboutthe same percentage as the increase (8.9 per cent) in 1965-66 over theprevious year.   It would be extremely serious for public presentation ifthe increase were to be even greater than last year.    I hope we shall beable to say that in terms of constant prices we are holding the increase inEstimates below 4-jr per cent, and shall reasonably be able to claim thatthe increase at constant prices in total public expenditure (including central and local government and the national insurance funds) is also likely to bebelow 4jj; per cent, the average for the period 1964-65 to 1969-70 in theNational Plan.    But an increase of around 9 per cent in money terms isformidable in relation to the economy and in relation to the Budget.Re c ommendation s6. The Cabinet is asked to endorse our recommendations inparagraph 4 above,i-i, J. O,Treasury Chambers, .3, W. 1.17th January, 1966-2-
ANNEX ASPACE PROGRAMMEEUROPEAN LAUNCHER DEVELOPMENT ORGANISATION (ELDO)At its meeting on l6th December (CC(65) 71st Conclusions, Minute 4),the Cabinet agreed that we   should work towards terminating our commitment to ELDO as soon as practicable taking into account the need to minimise the political damage of withdrawal.   The cost of ELDO in 1966-67 on theexisting basis is about  12 million.   If a decision was taken in March to end work on the launcher it would still take some time to bring expenditure to an end;   but allowing for cancellation charges we might keep expenditurein 1966-67 to about  8 million, which would secure a saving of the orderof  4 million in 1967.There is, however, a problem of presentation on which the Committee on public Expenditure has formed a different view from that of the Minister of aviation and the Minister of State, Foreign Office.   The Estimates will haveto be published before the meeting of ELDO Ministers in March at which thefuture of the ELDO programme will be decided.   The Minister of Aviation took the view that the publication in the Estimates of a provision of only 8 million would be a clear indication to other Governments that we hadalready decided irrevocably to withdraw from ELDO and that they were beingpresented with a fait accompli before the Ministerial discussion in March.
He favoured, therefore, the inclusion of a provision of  12 million in theEstimates, perhaps accompanied by a note that the figure would need to bere considered in the light of the Ministerial discussions in March.The Public Expenditure Co.uni.ttee, however, considered that it would givea wholly misleading impression of our attitude to include a provision of 12 million in the Estimates.     If in our present financial position weshowed ourselves willing to allocate  12 million for this purpose, and had asked Parliament for the money, we could hardly argue convincingly that we found the cost too great.     To include  12 million would unnecessarilyinflate the Estimates.     The Committee recoimendod strongly that only 8 million should be provided in the Estimates.     A note could be includedsaying that the figure would need to be considered in the light of decisions taken at the ELDO meeting in March in order to avoid accusations that wewere presenting ELDO with a f aij^ aqcpppli. ^BLACK JBSmThe second issue which arises on.the space programme is whetherprovision should be made for further expenditure on Black Arrow.     At its meeting on 16th December (CC(65) 71st Conclusions, Minute 4) the First Secretaof State sunning up said:    &quot;that no immediate decision should be taken onthe Black Arrow programme though the Cabinet were favourably disposed to itin principle;   this should be further considered  -ed both as regards the merits
SECRET- , ggof the pz-ogramne itself and in relation to the possibility of international co--operation.     The extent of the programme would need to be considered bythe Committee on Public expenditure the Committee has reviewed the case for enbarking on the Blaok arrow programme in the light of the. other claims on public expenditure.     they reached the conclusion that although there is no sufficient economicjustification for the development of a la.unch.er, to leave this fieldaltogether might have damaging effects on the future and might well be misunderstood by public opinion*     They were informed that there was no prospect of turning Black Arrow into a joint European venture.     they recommend, therefore, that the Black Arrow programme should proceed and thatthere should be provision of expenditure of  2,35 million in 1966-67.(3)
ANNEX B   1 97OVERSEAS INgOaitLArlONThe&apos;Departments concerned with overseas information have proposed anincrease in expenditure from  29.6 million in-196*5-66 to  32.6 million in1966-67 - an increase of almost 10 per cent.     The general activitiescovered are the work of the information services in posts overseas, theBritish Council and the BBC External Services.     About half the totalexpenditure is incurred overseas.About half of the increased expenditure proposed is connected withparticipation in the Montreal Exhibition which will cost  Ig nillipn in&apos; -&apos;   - &apos;. - &apos; . &apos; .1966-67.     This is essentially a prestige project and any assistance to theexport drive will be pretty indirect and marginal.     The Departments :concerned have claimed to be unable to find economies in other activities to offset this large additional item.-The Committee on Public Expenditure considered that in present&apos;circumstances it would be wrong to contemplate an increase in expenditureon overseas information of nearly 10 per cent in one year, particularlybearing in mind that this expenditure has doubled in the last eight years.Some increase is inevitable bearing in mind increases in costs and the extentto which we are committed on the Montreal Exhibition.     But the Committeerecommends that the increase should be restricted to about  1 million, giving a provision for 1966-67 of  30.6 million.     Within this ceiling the overseas departments should be asked to sorb out priorities and trim or cut out those services which in the light of present circumstances are least worth while.McWEf
ANNEX CDEFENCE AIDDepartments have asked for just under  23 rxillion to cover defence aid to foreign, Commonwealth and Colonial countries in 1966-67.     This is asubstantial reduction froa the figure of  29.h- million in last year&apos;estimates, mainly as a result of the tapering off of a number of substantialprogrammes begun in earlier years.Nevertheless, the Committee on Public E^cpenditure considered that anumber of the items were still unnecessarily large.     In particular, they recommend that only a token provision should be Included to cover a loan to   ,India for a frigate project since it is uncertain whether payments will berequired while military aid to India is suspended.     They also consider thatthe provision for military training facilities for Commonwealth officers andfor the secondment of British officers to Commonwealth Porces should not beincreased, as Departments propose, by 20 per cent from  2.78 million to 3.33 million.     The Committee recommend that these facilities, and inparticular secondment of British officers, should be restricted to those caseswhere it Is clearly in British interests to provide these facilities..     Andthey believe that an increase of about 8 per cent over the 1965-66 Estimates(i0e. a figure of  3 million) would be adequate for this purpose., The Committee also recommend that the provision for military aid toMalaysia should be restricted to the amount which is actually likely to be spent on the basis of present commitments.     ^Subsequent examination by the(5)SECRET
T:reasury indicates a saving of  f million below the figure submitted in thestinate7   T*The Commonwealth Ilelations Secretary- is malcing proposals to theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee for a new defence aid agreement withThe Colonial Secretary has suggested that the British contribution tothe cost of the Federal Guard in Southern Arabia should be included in thedefence aid prograrrie rather than in the overseas aid programme.     The costis just over  1 million.     The Co:.committee on Public Expenditure has noobjection to this change provided that the increase in the defence aid programme is offset by a corresponding decrease in the main overseas aid programme.     They could not, however, recommend the transfer if the only result was to permit an increa.se in other overseas aid expenditure up to theexisting limit.Malaysia and Singapore for the period 1966 to 1963.     But this is not for the1966-67 Estimates.(6)SECRET
.   . SECRET Al-srax D&apos;   &apos;   100-OVERSEAS, RBHffiSEICTATIONThe Departmental Estimate for the cost of the Diplomatic Service is submitted at  35.8 million, and that for Public Building Overseas at 9.9 million.     In preparing these Estimates the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretaries have reduced the basic complement of the Diplomatic Serviceproper (which represent about one-third of total staff at home and abroad)by over 100 posts to a total of 6,040.     The Minister of Public Building and works in the preparation of his Estimates has taken full account of the need to secure efficiency and economic running of building operations, and ofthe deferment of capital projects announced in July.     Nevertheless^ theCommittee on Public Expenditure&apos;considered that in present circumstances,and particularly in view of the foreign exchange cost, every effort shouldbe made to secure some further economies in this field.     The Minister ofPublic Building and Works is, at our request, considering what furtherdeferments of work would be practicable.     The Committee also asked theForeign Office and the Commonwealth Relations Office to consider whateconomies could be made in the cost of the Diplomatic Service and itssupporting services, the Estimate for which is at present  35.8 million,mainly for staff and related expenditure;   and that similar economies shouldbe made by other Departments with overseas staff.     The Committee would liketo see savings on the Diplomatic Service Estimate and overseas buildingscombined of  4 million, or as near this figure as can be managed without serious detrimental effects on the efficiency of our overseas representation.(7)SiECHET
