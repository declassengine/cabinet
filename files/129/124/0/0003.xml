confidential this DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OFHER BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   January 1966C(66)3 Copy No.    6612th January, 1966CABINETPRICES AND INCOMES policy memorandum by the First Secretary of State and secretary of State for Economic Affairs and the Ministerof LabourOne of our first decisions on taking office was to develop, on abasis of voluntary co-operation, a long-term policy for prices and incomes. We saw this, from the economic point of view, as one ofthe essential elements in the achievement of the 25 per cent increasein national output by 1970, combined with a strong   and a healthybalance of payments.2. We also saw it as important from a social point of view.We cannot improve the lot of the lowest paid workers, pensioners,and others in similar positions unless we can secure reasonablestability in prices and incomes.3. There is at present a good deal of defeatism about the policy.In the short space of a year we have in fact achieved much more thanmany critics expected. The institutional arrangements for reinforcingthe policy are developing well. Compared with the fiasco of 1963 and1964 when the general economic conditions were more favourable to the establishment of wage and price stability than they were inthe last twelve months, 1965 has shown real progress. The national board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) is now firmly established and hasalready achieved a degree of acceptance and respect which was neverexperienced by its predecessor, the National Incomes Commission.It has produced seven reports and is now working on a series of major references which could have a substantial effect on the futurehandling of a wide range of claims involving fair comparisonprinciples (e.g., railwaymen, Civil Service &quot; M &quot; Rate, higher CivilService and Armed Forces). We must of course recognise that the handling of arguments about comparisons has always presentedserious difficulties in previous attempts at an incomes policy. The6472a
reports the Board have already issued, despite having to learn bytheir own errors, have been taken seriously by both sides of industryand have led to agreements by employers to defer price increases;to changes in methods which should help to reduce the need for price increases; and to the reconsideration of wage structures which were becoming out of date. This, once started will gain momentum.4. Against this we have the undoubted fact that up till now the policy has been affecting the actual course of settlements andwage earnings far too slowly. Of course our policy is essentially along-term one and we have rightly rejected the alternative possibilityof a short, sharp wage freeze which might have had dramatic resultsfor about six months, but which could not have been sustained beyond that and would have led to a major reaction against the wholepolicy which would have been very damaging to our longer termprospects.5. We knew when we took this decision that there was already considerable pressure on both prices and pay generated by the developments of 1964. In particular, a general movement for a two-hour reduction in the working week was well under way and hashad a major effect on the movement of hourly wage rates. when this has worked through there should be a significant reduction inthe upward pressure of current negotiations on industrial costs. Wemust be clear though that commitments for pay increases resultingfrom long-term agreements will be exercising a considerable influence on the course of wage movements in 1966, and are likely to resultin the average level of increases being much higher than we should like. This simply will not be contained unless we agree to take amuch firmer line about new claims and commitments, recognisingwhat this means in practice.6. When the economic situation in the autumn became very bad we agreed that we should strengthen and intensify the policy.In consequence we shall be introducing legislation to put the NBPIon a statutory basis and to give the Government powers to requireadvance notification of changes in prices; in pay and conditions; andto impose a temporary standstill in appropriate cases whilst they arebeing investigated by the NBPI with all the attendant penalties. Andwe seem to be carrying the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the confederation of British Industries (CBI) reluctantly with us.7. These are important developments but we have now reachedthe stage when we must achieve positive results on the incomes frontmuch more rapidly. Prices have been more stable in recent monthsthan might have been expected from the movement in wages andother costs. It will not be possible to restrain prices much longer ifincomes continue to rise rapidly and charges in the public sector are going up. For this reason it is essential that in the months ahead thepolicy should have, and be seen to be having, a real impact on thegrowth of incomes both in the private and public sectors. If we canachieve this, the coming wage round could be significantly lower thanthe last and the psychological advantage of success on this front
would be enormous. There is therefore a great deal at stake and agreat deal to be gained. The handling of particular cases during thenext three months is likely to be decisive.8. We shall not, however, achieve the break-through whichis still possible unless we are prepared to take issue withconventional attitudes to industrial negotiations. Perhaps the mostdiscouraging aspect of the present situation is the obviousunwillingness of employers to take a firm line in applying to claims for pay increases the criteria for considering them, whichwere established with the agreement of representatives of bothsides of industry. The recent pressure to hold prices down should now help to stiffen their resistance to pay claims but our experience with the bakers demonstrated that at times it may be necessary forthe Government to intervene to persuade the unions to moderatetheir claims and to encourage the employers to take a firm line,even at the risk of seeming to precipitate industrial conflict.9. This is in sharp contrast to the traditional role of theGovernment in industrial relations. If, as in the past, the maintenanceof industrial peace were the overriding object it would be the dutyof the Minister of Labour to intervene in order to conciliate, evenin a case where a union was pressing with little justification a claim which was well above the average level of 3\ per cent andthreatening strike action if the employer did not give way. But,clearly, we shall get nowhere with the prices and incomes policyunless we are prepared to give priority to ensuring that settlementsreached are in conformity with the agreed prices and incomes policy.This means taking a different attitude to (a) conciliation and(b) arbitration.Conciliation10. The problem here is created by the potential conflict between, on the one hand, the Government^ responsibility for conciliation in industrial matters as a means of maintainingindustrial peace and, on the other, their responsibility for promotingan effective prices and incomes policy as an essential condition for achieving sound economic growth. In most cases a serious conflict between these two objectives can doubtless be avoided, but where. it cannot we must ensure that the longer-term objectives are not,as so often in the past, sacrificed under the immediate pressures.This means that the prices and incomes policy must be given its full weight by the Ministry of Labour in its conciliation duties andthat the Ministry will have the full support of the Government ifindustrial action results as it very well may in individual cases.11. There are two main types of pay dispute in which theMinistry of Labour is asked to conciliate. The first is where the employer is prepared to concede the union&apos;s demands, but wantsthe excuse that this has been done at the behest of the Ministryof Labour. This kind of exercise is quite inconsistent with theprices and incomes policy and must be avoided. All Ministry of6472
Labour conciliation officers are already under strict instructionsnot to put pressure on employers to make improved offers. but even so there is still scope for settlements to be reached under the auspices of the Ministry of Labour which are out of line with thepolicy. One possibility would be for the Government to announce that the Ministry of Labour reserved the right not to conciliate inparticular cases in which it appeared that the outcome might be inconsistent with the agreed criteria for prices and incomes. but some such cases might still arise in which the Ministry felt unableto refuse to conciliate in practice.12. In the second type of case the Ministry may be facedwith a strike or threatened strike over a pay dispute. There maybe occasions in which the employers are conscientiously trying to observe the agreed policy where the strike or threatened strike iseffectively against the Government and the incomes policy. while we should try by conciliation or any other means to remove thecircumstances in which threats of industrial action are made, wemust ensure that the results are consistent with the prices and incomes policy and in the last resort we must be prepared to stand firm in the face of such threats. It was difficult enough to observethis policy in the recent test case of the bakers. But there may be other cases in which it will be even more difficult to be resolutebecause of the power of the workers concerned to disrupt animportant sector of the economy..13. It is essential that we should demonstrate in such cases that we do not consider that industrial peace is more important than the prices and incomes policy, which is a necessary element in our total economic policy. There can be little doubt that over recent years far more economic damage has resulted from failure by Governments to stand up to threats of industrial action than could have resulted from the action itself. It is the failure to standup to strike threats which has led to the breakdown of all previousattempts to secure an incomes policy since the war. If we allow the present policy to break in an important case under the threat ofindustrial action, this will encourage other unions to make similarthreats in order to achieve their claims. Employers will then believethat it is cheaper in the long run always to yield on pay and then to put up prices. The result is bound to be a grave loss of confidence,both at home and overseas, in the reality of the prices and incomes policy and our economic policies generally.14. By our decision to stand firm in the bakers&apos; case we have greatly strengthened our ability to weather the next crisis of thiskind, wherever it may arise. We must ensure that we are equallydetermined and successful in handling the next claim backed by a threat of strike action or the next case where there is pressure to conciliate or to yield gracefully by appointing some body of enquiryother than the National Board. To achieve this the various departments concerned will need to work in the closest co-operation.We must also ensure that, as in the bakers&apos; case, the incomes policyis fully reinforced by the prices policy.
Arbitration15. Arbitration is an important method of resolving disputesabout pay and other matters without disturbance to industrial peace.Arbitrators are not under any formal obligation to take account ofthe national interest but tend to base their decisions solely on thearguments put forward by the two parties. They are likely tofollow the prices and incomes policy in the longer term as theparties themselves come more to accept it for practical purposes.But in the immediate future it is becoming clear that arbitrators&apos;awards can be so out of line with the policy as seriously to undermine it.16. It does not seem likely that this problem can be satisfactorily tackled by means of a statutory requirement thatarbitrators take account of the national interest. A preferable coursewould be to reach agreement with the TUC and CBI to alter the conventions under which arbitrators operate by formally requestingthem to take account of the agreed criteria laid down in Part I ofthe White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639). It hasnot so far been considered opportune to try to reach agreement onthis point. The main difficulty is that many of the public service staff associations, for whom arbitration is of particular importance,are not affiliated to the TUC and are likely to resent hotly anyattempt to alter the terms of reference of arbitrators. Anotherdifficulty is caused by the fact that not all arbitrators are appointedby the Minister of Labour.17. A third possibility would be to refer a suitable arbitration award to the National Board for Prices and Incomes for examination. Both the TUC and the CBI have accepted in principlethat arbitration awards should be susceptible to reference to theNational Board. A report by the Board which made it clear thatarbitrators should take account of the considerations in the white paper could hardly be ignored by arbitrators. This would helpconsiderably to secure a change in the general climate of opinionso that, without any formal request, arbitrators as well as the partiesbetween whom they arbitrate come to accept it as natural thatconsiderations of the national interest should play a part in theproceedings.18. Meanwhile we are considering the possibility ofreintroducing some form of compulsory arbitration. Shortly after we took office the TUC asked us to consider reintroducing somethingon the lines of the Industrial Disputes Tribunal which was abolishedin 1958. Under the Industrial Disputes Order one party to a disputewas able to take the other to the Tribunal, whose award wasbinding. Provided that any future compulsory arbitration tribunalwas required to have regard to the national interest, it could havea very useful part to play in relation to the prices and incomes policy particularly if the Government as well as one or other ofthe parties had power to refer cases to the tribunal.
6CONFIDENTIALConclusion19. There is no doubt that our prices and incomes policy islikely to be faced in the next few months with some major cases which could raise important issues of policy. We invite our colleagues to consider seriously the general approach set out in this paper, which we believe follows their earlier thinking. It willunquestionably require that prices and incomes policy should begiven a higher priority and that certain outmoded attitudes shouldbe discarded.G. B.R. J.
