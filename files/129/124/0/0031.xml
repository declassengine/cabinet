e DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 31 COPY NO.       6 69th February, 1966CABINETINDUSTRLAL DISPUTES: THREATENED RAIL STRIKENats by the Secretary of the CabinetBy direction of the Prime Minister I circvdate the attached minute by the Home Secretary in connexion with item 4 of the Cabinet A.gendafor Thursday, 10th February, 1966.(Signed)  BURLE trend cabinet Office, &amp;.W.1,9th February, 1966
PRIME MINISTERThreatened Rail strike the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies met this afternoonunder my Chairmanship to review the preparations being made to maintain essential supplies and services should the threatened rail strikematerialise.    We approved a number of detailed arrangements, togetherwith a draft of the Emergency Regulations, which are for practical purposes identical with those used in I960.There are, however, two major issues which I should put to you and on which you may wish to take the Cabinet&apos;s view when you raise theissue at tomorrow1 s meeting.    These are:-(l)   The date on which the Emergency Regulations should be made andlaid before Parliament.    These can be made by Order-in-Council andlaid either on Saturday, 12th February (up to 1 P.m. but not later) orMonday, 14th February.    If the latter, they will not be in force,until thefollowing day.    This would not have any great practical disadvantages:the Ministry of transport s plans v/ould not be affected and though thePost Office would have to act, as on previous occasions, from the startas though the Regulations were in force, this is not likely to be challengedand is acceptable to the Postmaster General.    My Committee therefore recommend that the Regulations should be laid before Parliament onMonday, 14th February.(2)   A number of announcements will, however, have to be issuedbefore then, to give detailed guidance to the public, if they are in any wayto be effective by the Monday.    In particular firm guidance must be givento employers about the arrangements for staff coming to work, early on-Friday if they are to make their plans before dispersing for the weekend.The announcements about emergency traffic arrangements for London and about motor insurance for travellers giving lifts should be made at thesame time.    The Post Office announcement of restrictions on the mailservice should be made on the Saturday.    Other detailed departmentalannouncements, such as those by the Ministry of Defence to give travellinginstructions to members of the Armed Forces and their families who may bein transit e.g. on leave from Germany, are also necessary.    Furthermore,the confidential discussions which are now taking place with localauthorities and the Air Corporations, for example, are bound to become known very quickly.    My Committee, therefore, thought it important thatthere should be an early statement of the Governments plans as a wholewhich should include ox- cover all the necessary departmental statements and that this announcement should be made as soon as possible on Fridaymorning and indeed, preferably by Thursday evening.    The detailed arrange-ments could be co-ordinated by the Press Working Party which has beenestablished for this purpose, but the timing and content of such a majorstatement are matters for a Ministerial decision.I suggest a draft be prepared by a small group of the senior officials concerned, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s conclusions, and submitted to ministers and then to yourself, if approved, on Thursday afternoon.9tp February, 1966
