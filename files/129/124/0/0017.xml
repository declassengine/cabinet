CONFIDENTIAL06C(66) 17 COPY NO. -_24th January, 1966CABINETLOCAL GOVERNMENT FINANCENote by the Secretary of the cabinet at the Cabinet meeting on 20th January (CC(66)2nd Conclusions, Minute 2), the Minister of housing and Local Government was invited to consider further:(i)  the capital grant for highways improvement;(ii)  a separate grant for education.A report by the Official Committee on LocalGovernment Finance covering these two aspects isattached.(Signed)    BURKE trend cabinet Office, S. 77,1.23rd January, i960CONFIDENTIALHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;SGOVERNMENT)
LOCAL &amp;g^MpE,FjOKJK;ERepojrt^ tv the Off&apos;1g1s3-^ Coapxttee1 o     The Official Committee on Local Government Finance have given furtherconsideration to the following questions raised in the memoranda recentlysubmitted by the Minister of Housing and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to cabinet (c(66) 1) and 0(66) 2 respectively) which   were remitted forfurther study by officials -(i)   Whether -the capital grant for highways improvement and construction should be at a rate of 75 per cent (as it is underthe present grants system) or at a rate of 50 per cent in common with that proposed for all capital grants under the new system,(ii)   Whether there should be a further ad hoc addition of  5 million in respect of highways maintenance in county boroughs to thesum agreed for the increase   in the total Exchequer revenuegrants in the first year of operation,,(iii)   Whether there should be a separate grant for education orwhether all assistance to education should be merged into therate support grant (the distribution of which would of course be altered accordingly by the inclusion of educational factors in the distribution formula).20    A reduction from 75 per Gent to 50 per cent was originally favoured by the Ministry of Transport as part of their plan to restore a hetteibalance of responsibility as between Central and Local Government for expenditure on improvement of main roads in towns.     However? in the lightof discussions with local authority associations and further study ofthe effect of the proposal, particularly on the larger authorities, it isnow clear that 50 per cent capital grants for this purpose -would not be practicable.     It is the view of the Ministry of Transport and the Ministryof Housing and Local Government that the incidence of expenditure on majorroad improvements in towns is so variable, both as to time and place, thatit would not be possible to find a highways factor formula for inclusion in the rate support grant which would redistribute this grant in a way which would compensate the local authorities most heavily affected by thereduction from 75 per cent to 50 per cent0     Some authorities would loseheavily whereas others would benefit excessively,,     Over a sufficiently long period of time, these ill effects might be corrected:   but there wouldbe great anomalies meanwhile-1-
To retain a 75 per cert capital grant for highways, together with a50 per cent capital grant for other services, would nean an additionalincrease in Exchequer assistance of  27 million (at 1965 prices) in1967/68, and this would increase in later years as the road programmeexpands o     This is in addition to the large and rapidly increasingcapital and revenue grants which are already provided for in the scheme.The Committee were unable to agree on the extent of the risk ofrepercussion on the other services.     The Department of Education and science, which deals with over half of the capital expenditure in question,takes the view that once there is so important an exception to the general rule of 50 per cent there will be pressure on the part of the EducationalServices to be regarded as a further exception:   the argument, based ondistributive grounds, advanced in favour of the 75 per cent irate for high-ways might be said to apply with similar force to expenditure on education,particularly further education.     The Home Office and Ministry of Healthfeel that there would be less immediate pressure as far as their services are concerned, although in due course a demand for equal treatment might develop.     The Ministry of Housing and Local Government take the view&apos;that the distributional argument is not as valid for other services as itis for highways and that it would be possible to defend a differencebetween maintaining an existing grant at 75 per cent and institutingentirely new ones at 50 percent.     The Scottish Office envisage nodifficulty over a 75 per cent highways grant and a 50 per cent grant forother services.The expenditure on roads \?ould account for about a third of the totalof the amount disbursed by the Bsohequer as capital grant.   If a rate of75 per cent for highways were introduced in conjunction with a 40 per concentrate for other services, the call on the Exchequer would be no more than with a common rate of 50 per cent.    However, the arguments aboutrepercussions obviously apply with greater force to this proposition.The Committee would not regard this solution as practicable.The Committee considered also the implications of changing the schemeso that there would be no new capital grants  or education, health, policesta/tions etc).     This would not necessarily affect the total of localauthorities1 capital expenditure.     Their borrowing requirements would be higher than under the original scheme with capital grants, but the higherloan charges would be eligible for Exchequer assistance via the rate-support grant.     As between the original 50 per cent capital grant schemeand the 75 per cent highway grant with no new capital grants, any extracharge on the level of local rates would be very small in relation to thefigures under consideration in this paper.   It would on the other handsubstantially reduce the immediate charge on Departmental Totes,
The Department of Education and Scienoe see no particular advantage in a capital grant system from their Departmental point of vie,.&apos;:   theMinistry of Health favour the capital grant system on control grounds:the Scottish end Welsh Offices would prefer to see the capital grantelement kept in the scheme.The capital grant element of the original scheme did not appear to attract the local authority associations strongly.     On the other hand,there might clearly he some embarrassment in withdrawing a concessionalready proposed even in order to meet them in maintaining the 75 per centhighway grantj   end they might in any case ask for assurances aboutaccess to the Public works Loans Board.     It might perhaps be wise not totake a final decision until the associations* attitude had been tested.The points for decision by Ministers are -(a) whether the highway grant should be maintained at 75 per cent(b) if so, whether -(i)   an extra Exchequer cost of  27 million at 1965prices in 1967-68, and rising in subsequent years, should be accepted, or(ii)   the new capital grants should be dropped fromthe scheme. 5 million Assistance in respect of J&amp;fdiway Maintenance in County Boroughs3*     Hitherto the Country Boroughs and the London County Council havenever had any assistance towards highway maintenance.     This expenditure,like all other local authority expenditure which has not previously beenspecifically grant-aided or included in the general grant, will now comeinto the calculation of the total of Exchequer revenue grant.The question is whether there are sufficient grounds to distinguishthis expenditure from others which will now rank for grants for the firsttimej    and so to justify an ad hoc addition    of  5 million to the 30 million in the first year ( 60 million in the second yea,r, etc,,) whichis the additional transfer to local authorities on revenue account underthe new scheme.The case for doing so is that if such an addition were made, it wouldbe possible to assure the other local authorities that the county boroughswere not in any possible sense getting this assistance for  highwaysnaintenance at their expense.     The case against doing so is that itincreases the Exchequer cost by  5 million a year, over and above thelevel of  30 million which is required to meet the objectives of the schemefor the distribution of the burden of local expenditure between the rate-payer and the taxpayer.-3-
Cabinet Office, S,W,,1.24th January, \3&amp;*qEducation4o     The Educational Departments are satisfied that there ore no techincal or aairirdatrative advantages in maintaining a separate grant for educationunder the new Grants System,     A 50 per cent education grant would not provide the whole of the Exchequer assistance for educational expenditure which the scheme produces;   some of it would emerge as zates-support grant.It would be impossible, therefore, to plan local authority educationalexpenditure by reference to the separate education grant alone.is agreed that if the specific grant for education were raised to60 per cent? the new grants system as a whole would not be viable becuasethere would be too little available for distribution via rates-support grant.     The local authority associations do not appear to favour aseparate education grant, the workings of which they feel will be misunderstood.It is agreed that there are no administrative or technical advantages,or reasons of educational policy, for retaining the idea of a separateeducation grant,
