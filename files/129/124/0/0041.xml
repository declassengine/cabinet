9 O -JEXCHEQUER SUPPORT FOR A STATUTORY SCHEMEOF MINIMUM PRICES FOR WHITE FISHMemorandum by the Chief Secretary, treasury can see no justification for an Exchequer contribution to theminimum price scheme proposed by the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Agriculture in C(66) 38.2.       It is difficult to assess the consequences of a scheme which has yet to be worked out in detail.    Nevertheless it will clearly havecontroversial features which in my view make it unsuitable for exchequer support.    My reasons are as follows:(i)   This is a scheme to benefit the industry.    If the industry wantit, they should be prepared to finance it themselves;   if they do not wantit enough to finance it themselves, there is no reason why the exchequer should bribe them to accept it.(ii)  It would be very unv/ise to subscribe to a statutory scheme at atime when the existing voluntary scheme is under examination by the restrictive Practices Court.(iii) The scheme would tend to protect the less efficient parts of theindustry and to raise the price of fish to the consumer.(iv) I do not accept that there would be any substantial offset onsubsidies.    It is true that the special subsidies given to help specific 1trawlers over temporary difficulties might be somewhat reduced but these are subject to a limit of  350,000 a year.     They are currentlyrunning at  35,000 a year.(v)   The balance of payments effects of the scheme would seem, at best, uncertain.     The existence of minimum prices could have theeffect cf increasing the amount of fish which we import.(vi)  It is unwise to pledge ourselves to a scheme, particularly bypromising an Exchequer contribution, before its compatibility with our international obligations has been thoroxighly examined.3.       I therefore recommend that the proposal for an exchequer contribution should be rejected. ,.J.D.
