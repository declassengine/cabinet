ANNEX &quot; 131INDUSTRIAL REORGANISATION CORPORATIONOur future prosperity depends on our ability to bring about a fundamental improvement in the balance of payments.    If we are to succeed in this, new initiatives are required to enable Britishindustry to meet more effectively the growing competition it  willface in world markets.     The new system of incentives recently announced by the Government&apos;^ will provide a powerful stimulus tomodernisation and investment in key sectors of the economyi   butfurther changes in the structure and organisation of industry arerequired to make this fully effective.2.       The need for more concentration and rationalisation to promote the greater efficiency and international competitiveness of Britishindustry, which was emphasised in the National Plan/1, is now widely recognised.     With the co-operation of financial institutions, manyindustries have already substantially altered their structure and organisation through mergers, acquisitions and regroupings.     this process has been accelerating in recent years and may be expectedto continue.    Nevertheless, the pace and scale of change do not yetmatch the needs of the national economy.3.      Many of the production units in this coimtry are small by comparison with the most successful companies in international trade, whose operations are often based on a much larger market.In some sectors the typical company in Britain is too small to achieve long production runs; to take advantage of economies of scale; to undertake effective research and development; to supportspecialist departments for design and marketing; to instal the mostmodern equipment or to attract the best qualified management.Moreover, large groups may often have been built up haphazardly orsolely to achieve wide diversification and may not therefore be organised to secure full efficiency in current conditions.    Size and efficiency do not, of course, always go together - there are efficientsmall companies and inefficient large ones,     What is needed is tocreate a structure which will enable us to make the most effective use, in the years ahead, of our resources of skill, management and capital.4.       There is no evidence that we can rely on market forces aloneto produce the necessary structural changes at the pace required.Some of the industries most in need of rationalisation have an in-builttendency to stay as they are.    Either there are a few large firms which are tempted to live and let live; or there are a number ofsmall ones, none of which alone is strong enough to achieve thescale of operations needed for international competition.    Moreover,some mergers simply lead to a concentration of ownership withoutsecuring a more effective deployment of the assets of the mergedcompanies and result in loosely-knit groups of comparatively smallproduction units ranging over a wide variety of manufacturingactivities.*  Cmnd, 2874/ Cmnd, 2764 (Chapter 1, paragraph 37)-1-
C   ^8 Fl 13 EE N&quot;I*I^\L5.       Although there is now a large number of institutions whichcan provide specialist services to meet the financial and other needsof industry, there is no organisation whose special function is to search for opportunities to promote rationalisation schemes whichcould yield substantial benefits to the national economy.    Merchantbanks and issuing houses carry through a great many mergers every year, but they can in general only act at their clients1 request.Desirable regroupings fail to take place through lack of initiative and sponsorship, or because, when opportunities arise, there is noone ready to grasp them.     The Government consider that this gap inthe institutional framework needs to be filled and they propose to setup a new statutory body for the purpose, to be called the industrial reorganisation Corporation.    The necessary legislation will beintroduced as soon as possible.6.       The Corporation will seek the fullest co-operation from industry and existing financial institutions, and schemes which itinitiates will, whenever possible, be put into effect either throughthe normal machinery of the market or in close collaboration with themarket.    It will be able to acquire a stake in the ownership of newgroupings 01* enterprises it helps to create or to expand.    It will not,however, act as a general holding company and will be able to dispose of its investments when the profits of rationalisation have been assuredand it can do so to advantage.    The faster it turns over its capital,the greater will be its capacity to promote the objects for which it isbeing set up.7.       The Corporation will give priority to schems of rationalisationand modernisation which offer good prospects of early returns interms of increased exports or reduced import requirements, and willhave regard to the regional aspects of the Governments policies for economic development.     It will not support ventures which have no prospect of achieving eventual viability.8.       In identifying the sectors where early action is needed, theCorporation will look for advice and suggestions from industry andthe City, from Government departments and the Economic Develop-ment Committees.    It will effect rationalisation and reorganisationby whatever method best suits the circumstances of the particular case.    In many instances its role will be to act as catalyst,providing initiative and ideas, helping the companies concerned andtheir advisers to work out practical schemes and arranging for any necessary expert services to be made ava-ilable.    It will payparticular attention to the management needs of new groupings.9.       In order that the Corporation may be able to operate on an effective scale and to promote a number of schemes simultaneously,it must have large financial resources at its disposal.    It will needfunds to help to put together new groupings on a sound economic basis.    It may also need to provide capital for new projects orexpansions of special importance to the economy.    Some new group-ings may initially have difficulty in raising finance, especially in theform of medium-term loans, and the Corporation will have to be in aposition to make capital available for expansion of research,-2-
\&amp;\m?     K t    Sa 1   1 Inbdevelopment and design facilities or for investment in new plant,especially cost-saving machinery of modern design.     Most rationalisation -sation schemes will of themselves remove the main impediments tothe introduction of modern equipment, but in some instances theCorporation may need to take special steps to ensure that particulartypes of advanced machinery are installed.    For this reason it willbe empowered to hold physical assets, so that in appropriate cases it will be able to purchase machines and make them available to newgroupings, by leasing them or by making other suitable arrangements.The Corporation will co-operate with the Ministry of technology and with the National Research Development Corporation, which maybe able to help it to make rationalisation more effective in industries which are passing through a period of rapid technologicalchange.    It will also co-operate with the Ministry of Public building and &quot;Works in matters affecting the construction industry.10.     The terms on which it will be appropriate for the corporation to make finance available will vary from case to case and it will need to be able both to make loans and to take up equity holdings.The Government propose that it should be given, in the firstinstance, the right to draw as needed up to  15 0 millions from theExchequer.    It would be required to make fixed interest payments on part of thisj the remainder would take the form of ExchequerDividend Capital, the dividend on which would be settled by referenceto the profits available after the fixed -interest borrowing had beenserviced and adequate provision made for reserves.11.     Many of the rationalisation schemes sponsored by theCorporation will result in mergers which come within the scope ofthe Monopolies and Mergers Act, 1965.    As the Government made clear when the Act was introduced, it is no part of its purpose tohold back mergers which are desirable in the national interest.Arrangements will therefore be made, so that companiesparticipating in the Corporation^ schemes can be certain, beforeschemes are completed, that the resulting mergers will not bereferred to the Monopolies Commission.12.     These proposals are an integral part of the Governments plans for modernising the economy and complement the new system of investment incentives recently announced.     The Government considerthat, in co-operation with industry and the City, the Corporation willbe able to secure a lasting improvement in the structure and competitive strength of British industry.-3-
