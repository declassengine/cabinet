BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)DEFENCE REVIEW:THE STATEMENT ON THE DEFENCE ESTIMATES 1966, PART memorandum by the Secretary of State for DefenceThis year the Statement on the Defence Estimates has been printedin two parts, to be published at the same time.    Part II deals with theDefence Estimates for 1966/67.    Part I, of which the draft is attached tothis memorandum, is a report on the progress of the Defence Review.   Inorder to ensure its publication on 23rd February, the proof needs to be inthe hands of the printers by 16th February.    Because of this tight time-table, the same paper is being circulated simultaneously to the defence and Oversea Policy Committee and the Cabinet.    Amendments suggestedby my colleagues on the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee will be circulated separately.2.

STATEMENT ON THE DIF!nos. ESTIMATES 1966PART I - THE DEFhNCE REVIEWThis year the Statement on the Defence Estimatesis printed in two parts.     Part I is a report on thedefence review and looks into the 1970s.     Part II isahout the defence estimates for the coming year,1966/7;    its scope is confined to the problems of thepresent or the immediate future.I THE PURPOSE OF THE review on taking office in October 196h, the government decided to carry out a far reaching examination ofthe nation&apos;s defence needs in the next decade, with two objectives:    to relax the strain imposed on theBritish economy by the defence programme it hadinherited, and to shape a new defence posture forthe 1970s.2.     Military strength is of little value if it is achieved at the expense of economic health.     Thedefence plans of the previous Government would have involved an excessive burden both in resources and inforeign exchange.     As we emphasised in the national plan   (Command 275h), to continue spending over 7% ofthe gross national product on defence, would be seriously damaging to Britain&apos;s economy, at a timewhen we need a rapid increase in production so that wecan export more and import less;    when industry mustbe re-equipped and modernised;    and when we are running into a shortage of manpower.     We plan, there-fore, to bring our defence expenditure down to about% of the gross national product by 1969/70, therebyimproving our ability to compete successfully withother exporting countries0ffi-lnartqlal /-Target
-2-Finaneial Target3.     As a guide for recasting the defence programme,the Government set a financial target of  2,000m. at196U prices, to he reached in 1969/70.     In other words, we intend that our programme three years from now should not cost more in real terms than that oftwo years ago     This means a reduction of  I4.O.M, or16% on the plans of the previous Government.     some progress tovrards this goal was made &quot;by the changes inthe equipment programme which we announced more thana year ago.     On 5th August, 1965? we reported that wehad managed to get more than half way to our target -from  2,^.00m to about  2,180m - without reducing our ability to carry out the present scale of militarytasks oho     But these changes, though achieving a major cut in expenditure without any loss in military efficiency,and thereby relieving the burden in resources on thenation&apos;s economy, did nothing to reduce the excessive,cost of defence in foreign exchange.-     Nor did theycontribute to solving the second major problem which led the Government to undertake the defence   review -the over-stretch, of our military manpower.Manpower Stretch5*.     Although our political commitments have become feweain recent years, larger military tasks have been imposed by those that remain.     The military power of potentialenemies has been increased over the same period,mainly by sophisticated equipment from abroada/As a result,
As a result, the hulk of our fighting forces outside europe have &quot;been permanently tied down in operationaltasks all over the world.     On several occasions nounits of the strategic reserve have been immediately available in Britain.     We have thus been compelledto make use of our right to withdraw forces committedunder the Brussels Treaty to serve in Germany, inorder to meet temporary needs overseas.6.     The Services have responded to a succession ofunforeseen contingencies with cheerful efficiency.But the cost has been high.     Men in all three services have been required to work long hours and toserve for long periods abroad often without their families.7.     The following figures give some idea of the burdens imposed.Average employment of destroyers/frigates:Annual        Days of 2h     RatioAnimal   Hours Hours Sea,:Mileage Underway     Underway        Harbour1956-7   27,600     1950 81 1  : k1963-4   33,U50    2430 1U2 1:1.5ArmyNumbers of units and men sent overseas on emergencyor unaccompanied tours		Numbers	Individual		Major Units	in Units	Postings	Total1963	8	hOOO	600	U6001961;	16	8000	1200	9.20Q1965	17	8500	1h00	9900Roval.

8S     Against this background both recruiting andre-engagement have fallen short of the targets set;this in turn has increased the strain on our alz^eadyover-stretched Services.     Such over-stretch has themost damaging consequences in our defence policy as awhole.     Besides restricting our military ability tomeet the unforeseen, it limits our politicalfreedom to adjust our defence programme from time totime as circumstances change.     Even a relatively small contraction in our present defence effort will mean that we must relinquish some of our present commitments overseas.     In planning to close the gapof  180m., which still remained in August, we setout not only to decide which political commitments wemust give up, but also to limit the scale of themilitary tasks which may be imposed by the commitments which remain.
-5-II     Wrl^M-^^II^^X-^^M9.       We are compelled to plan the main features of our defence policy a decade ahead;    it takes at least temyears to develop and introduce a major new weaponsystem, and at least five years to produce basefacilities abroad.     And yet there can never becertainty either about political or technologicaldevelopments in the intervening period.     defence policy must therefore be based on what can never be more than guesses, formed on an imperfect knowledgeof the facts.     The fate of the 1957 Defence white paper illustrates the dangers of &quot;being over-dogmatic about weapons and political developments.10.     At the same time, it is essential that theGovernment should, take some firm decisions basedon the best predictions it can make.      Otherwise itwill waste its resources by ill-judged attempts toprepare for too wide a range of contingencies, and will fail to prepare properly for any.     Above all, theGovernment can, and must, decide in broad terms what sort of role Britain should play in the world in ten years *time, and what part its military forces should play in supporting that role.     In other words,  it has todecide what sort of military capability is likely tomake political sense.The United Nations and. Disarmament11.     Recent history underlines the importance to britain, as to all other countries, of strengthening the United Nations as the main instrument for keepingpeace.     Britain is already making a major contribution/to
-6-to the United Nations&apos; forces in Cyprus, and has offeredfurther units for logistic support of a United nations force, whenever this is required in future.     Politicaldisagreements, not only among the great Powers, hutalso among the small, have so far set limits to theUnited Nations&apos; authority for peace-keeping, and thefailure of many countries to make the necessary financial contribution has limited the United Nations&apos;capability in this field.     But it remains a major aim off British policy to enable the United Nations toassume increased powers in the years to come.12.     Most major P/owers are becoming more conscious that their own security can only be safeguarded by bringing the international arms race to a halt.     the trend of military technology suggests that the survival of humanity itself will soon depend on making progress towards general and complete disarmament.     The most urgent and immediate problem is to stop the furtherspread of nuclear weapons.     V/e believe that theBritish Government should be prepared to give up its ownnuclear forces at any time when it is satisfied this willm-ake    possible the achievement of this goal.Meanwhile we aim to internationalise our nuclearstrategic forces in order to strengthen the alliance.13.     The conventional arms race among the smallerPowers continues unchecked, posing grave dangers fortheir economic development and political stability.Here, too, the only certain solution would be aninternational agreement to control both the productionand supply of armaments.     This, again,  remains a majoraim of British policy.
, 9 o w111.     Meanwhile v/e cannot, safely hase our defence policy for the 1970s on the assumption that our objectives will have been attained in full.     Wemust be ready to continue to live in a world inwhich the United Nations has not yet assumedeffective responsibility for keeping peace, andthe arms race has not yet been brought to ahalt.NATO and the Defence of europe in such a world15.   /the first purpose of our armed forces will be,as now, to ensure the survival of the British people.The security of these islands still depends above allon preventing war in Europe.     Eo?^ this reason, v/eregard the continuation of the North Atlantic allianceas the key to - our survival.16.     NATOls experience over the last decade suggeststhat there is small danger of deliberate war in Europe atany level so long as the potential aggressor believes that this is likely to lead to a nuclear response.The credibility of this response hinges on the solidarity between the nuclear and non-nuclear membersof NATO.     This in turn depends largely on satisfying the non-nuclear members that,  in a crisis, nuclear weapons will - or will not - be used in accordance withthe wishes of the alliance as a whole.17*     Broad guide-lines governing the possible recourseby NATO to nuclear weapons in self-defence were agreed at the Athens meeting of the NATO Council in 1962;increased participation by officers of member countries,in nuclear planning and control was approved at the ottawa meeting In 1963.     Though we see no sign that/the
-8-the credibility of the nuclear response has fallen belowthe level required to deter aggression, the way   inwhich the decision to use nuclear weapons would betaken in a crisis and the strategic doctrine whichshould determine their employement requires further study.     An important function of the Special Committeeof Defence Ministers, which met for the first time inNovember 19^5,  is to reduce any uncertainty to theminimum.18. 7/hen general agreement has been rcashed on theprinciples and procedure by which the alliance shouldcontrol the use of its nuclear weapons, it will be easier to reach, an understanding on whether and, if so, how some of these weapons should be organised in a collective force.     We believe that our proposalsfor an Atlantic Nuclear Force remain the best basis fordiscussion, since they would give firm guarantees againstthe further i^roliferation of nuclear weapons within the alliance.19. Until jprogress is made towards disarmament,the only alternative to our present dependence on nuclear weapons would be a massive build-up of NATO*s conventional forces in Western Europe.      Even if Britain wereprepared to face the heavy economic burdens imposed bythis alternative, NATO as a whole is not willing to doso.     A decision by NATO to increase its conventional forces in this way v/ould in any case stimulate anarms race in Europe, since the Warsaw powers v/ouldprobably follow suit.     It would provide no protectionif the aggressor himself decided to use nuclear weapons/firstN
first.20.    On the other hand, once nuclear weapons were employed, in Europe,  on however limited a scale,  itis almost certain that \in less the aggressor quicklydecided to stop fighting, the conflict would escalaterapidly to a general nuclear exchange, in which thewhole of Americafs nuclear forces would he engaged.Organised land warfare would then soon &quot;become impossible.     We believe,  therefore,  that the allianceshould abandon those military preparations which reston the assumption that a general war in Europe mightlast for several months.21o   At the same time, NATO must maintain enoughconventional forces to suppress small-scale conflictsin the European theatre without automatic 1resort to nuclear weapons, when the origin of the conflict may be uncertain and the intentions of theenemy obscure.     The number of ground formationsalready available for this purpose is probablysufficient, if they are adequately manned, trained and equipped.     But more air support is needed for suchconventional operations.     The alliance could providethis without overall additional expense, provided itis ready to reduce the number of long-range nuclearstrike aircraft it at present maintains to add. to theAmerican strategic forces in general war.22.    In all these circumstances, we think it rightto maintain our ground forces in Germany at their existing level until satisfactory arms control arrangements havebeen agreed in Europe.     It remains essential, however,that some means is found for   meeting the foreign exchange cost of maintaining these forces in Germany0We shall strengthen our air support for conventional/ground
-10-ground forces in Germany at the cost of some reductionin our nuclear strike aircraft based there.     We shallretain roughly our present capability for nuclear strikefrom British bases.     We think that we can make some reduction in the level of our naval forces at presentdeclared to NATO.     We shall be consulting our alliesabout these changes.
- 11 -Outside Europe23.    Outside Europe a direct threat to our survival atfirst sight seems less likely.     We have a number of obligations, some arising formally from treaties, which wecannot relinquish unilaterally at short notice;    some ofthese obligations will still exist in the 1970s.    although we have important economic interests in the Middle East,Asia and elsewhere, military force is not the most suitablemeans of protecting them, and they would not alone justifyheavy British defence expenditure.      But in addition to herspecific obligations, Britain shares with other countries ageneral interest in seeing peace maintained, so far aspossible, throughout the world.      It is this interest above all which justifies our military presence outside Europe0!Today, more than ever, peace is indivisible.2k.    Much of Africa, the Middle East, and Asia, is going through a period of revolutionary change, which is  liablesometimes to spill across international frontiers.      Inrecent years the threat to peace has been far greater out-side Europe than within it.     When such instability leads to open war, it may imperil not only economic interests inthe area, but even world peace.     Great powers may be tempted to intervene and to collide with one another asthey intervene.     On more than one occasion, in the recentpast, we have seen how local conflict in a far away country has threatened to embroil the major powers in a directconfrontation, directly endangering world peace.25.    Britain&apos;s forces outside Europe can help to reduce this danger.     Recent experience in Africa has shown that our ability to give rapid help to friendly governments, witheven small British forces, can prevent large scalecatastrophes.      In some parts of the world the visible/presence
- 12 -presence of British forces &quot;by itself is a deterrent tolocal conflict.     No country with a sense of internationalresponsibility would renounce these capabilities withoutgood reason, unless it were satisfied that others could,and would, assume a similar role.26.    Nevertheless, to maintain all our current militarytasks and capabilities outside Europe would impose an unacceptable strain on our overstretched forces, and beartoo heavily both on our domestic economy, and on our reserves of foreign exchange.     For all these reasons wehave decided that, while Britain should retain a majormilitary capability outside Europe, it should in future besubject to certain general limitations.     First, Britainmust not undertake major operations of war except as partof a collective force.     Secondly, we must not accept an obligation to provide a foreign country with military assistance unless it is prepared to provide us with thefacilities we need to make such assistance effective intime.     Finally, there must be no attempt to maintaindefence facilities in an independent country against itswishes.27.   We cannot forecast with any confidence precisely howBritain&apos;s forces will be deployed outside Europe at any given time in the 1970s, &quot;but in order to relax the strainfrom which our forces have suffered for so long, and toimpi^ove the ratio of home to overseas service, it will benecessary to keep a higher proportion than now in a homestation, and to rely on air mobility.   Nevertheless, it 1sd.desirable to take some decisions about the deployment ofcur forces now.The, Jfle di t e rjpanejm28.   We have a direct responsibility for Gibraltar and a defence agreement with Malta.     We also have a Treaty with/Libya,
,      . - 13 -    JLibya, an obligation to support CENTO and responsibilities in Cyprus.     We shall continue to discharge these responsibilities and obligations while making substantial economies in our establishments in Cyprus and Malta.     Forexample, the RAF and Army numbers at Nicosia airfield willbe considerably reduced, starting this year.     We intend,in accordance with Article 6 of the Defence Agreement, toenter into consultations with the Government of Malta fora reduction of British Forces in the next few years;    a range of defence facilities will, however, be retained.In Gibraltar, the garrison, airfield and naval dockyard andother establishments will continue to be maintained,Middle East29.    South Arabia is due to become independent not later than 1968.      We have informed the Federal Government thatwe intend to give up the base in Aden at that time.     Weshall be able to fulfil our remaining Treaty obligations in the area by making a small increase in our forces stationed in the Persian Gulf.Far Jjast jmjl^Squth East Asia30.    It is in the Far East and Southern Asia that thegreatest danger to peace may lie in the next decade, andsome of our partners in the Commonwealth may be directlythreatened.     We believe that it is right that britain should continue to maintain a military presence in this area.     Its effectiveness will turn largely on the arrange-ments v/e can make with car Commonwealth partners and other allies in the coming years.     As soon as.conditions permitus to do so, we shall wish to make some reductions in theforces which v/e keep in the area.     We have important military facilities at present in Malaysia and Singapore,as have our Australian and New Zealand, partners, and these weplan to retain.     Against the day when it may no longer be/possible
-Ik-possible for us to use these facilities freely, wehave begun to discuss, with the Government of Australia,the practical possibilities of our using military facilities in that country if necessary.Other Areas31 o     It will be necessary for sometime yet to retainsubstantial forces in Hong Kong, but we can look withsome confidence to a reduction of our commitments forthe defence of our smaller dependent territories, someof which will soon achieve independence.     We shallnot require garrisons in British Guiana or theSouthern African Territories for much longer.Island territories in the Atlantic, Indian orPacific Oceans can readily be protected from our majorareas of deployment.
CONFIDENTIAL&quot;15&quot; &quot;     235III    THE^E^UIHpNT OF OUR FORCES32.     Against the &quot;background of the political commitments and military tasks which it foresees, the Government hasbeen able to take some major decisions on the equipment of our forces.     The main object has been to strike a balance &quot;bet wen quantity and quality.     Our forces must always possess enough of the arms and equipment required for the day-to-day tasks of peacekeepingthroughout the world:    it is also essential thatthey should have some highly-sophisticated weapons which can deter potential enemies from raising thelevel of a local conflict to a degree which might ,endanger world peace.     v/e are determined to maintain a proper balance of capability in both these fields.The Navy of the 1970s33.     The Royal Navy will exploit to the full the mostmodern technologies in the maritime sphere, particularlyin nuclear propulsion and guided missiles.&quot;     When thePolaris-carry-ipg  , nuclear submarine fleet becomes fullyoperational in 1969/70, the Royal Navy will take over from the Royal Air Force full responsibility for the strategic nuclear deterrent, at a planned cost of under % of the total defence budget.      By the early 1970swe reckon to have in service four nuclear-propelledhunter-killer submarines, which, with their longendurance and Immunity to detection, will be a formidablepart of our anti-submarine defences.     V/e shall complete the conversion of the Tiger class cruisers to carryanti-submarine helicopters and we are planning a &quot; .   -new type of ship to succeed them.     We shall shortlyorder the first of a new, more powerful? class of guidedmissile ships - the Type 82 - to be equipped with the surface-to-air guided weapon Seadart,    the Ikara anti-submarine weapon and the new Anglo-Dutch radar.   Y/e/shall
-16-shall develop a small surface-to-surface guided weaponfor use against missile-firing craft.      Our amphibiousfleet - the commando ships and assault craft carryingRoyal Marine commandos - will greatly strengthen our forces outside Europe.3h.    The present carrier force will continue well intothe 1970s;   hut we shall not &quot;build the carrier (CVA 01).This ship could not have come into service before 1973*when our remaining commitments will not require herand the necessary   elements of carrier capabilitywill have been replaced as explained below.35.   The conditions under which we intend to operateour forces outside Europe are set out in paragraph 26.There are limitations on the use of our present forces;we must face the fact that these limitations are likelyto grow more severe.     This is the background to anyassessment of the case for keeping a carrier force in the far East in the 1970s.      Experience and study haveshown that only one type of operation exists for whichcarriers and carrier-borne aircraft would he indispensablethat is the landing, or withdrawal, of troops againstsophisticated opposition outside the range of land-based air cover.     It is only realistic to recognisethat we, unaided by our allies, could not expect toundertake operations of this character in the 1970s -even if we could afford a larger carrier force than plannec36.   But the best carrier force we could, manage to have in future would he very small.     The force of fivecarriers, which we inherited from the previous Government,will reduce to three in a few years&apos; time.     Even ifCVA 01 were built, the force would he limited to three ships throughout the 1970s.     The total cost of such a/force
-17-force would be some  12+GOm over a ten-year period.For this price, we should &quot;be able to have one carrierpermanently stationed in the Far Fast with anotheravailable at up to 15 days&apos; notice.     &quot;He do notbelieve that this could give a sufficient operationalreturn for our expenditure.37.    We also believe that the tasks for which carrier-borne aircraft might be required in the late 1970s canbe more cheaply performed in other ways.      Our plan is that, in the future, aircraft operating from landbases should take over the strike/reconnaissance andair defence functions of the carrier on the reduced scale which we envisage that our commitments willrequire after the middle of the 1970s.     Close anti-submarine protection of the naval force will be givenby helicopters operating from ships other thancarriers.     Airborne early warning radar aircraft willbe operated from existing carriers, v/hich we intend tokeep as long as we can for this purpose.     Strikecapability against enemy warships will be provided bythe surface-to-surface guided missile already mentioned.38.    In order to give time to reshape the Navy and toreprovide the necessary parts of the carriers&apos;capability, we attach great importance to continuing the existing carrier force as long as possible intothe 1970s.     The purchase of Phantom aircraft forthe Navy will, therefore, go ahead, though on a reduced scale.     The Buccaneer 2 will continue toenter service,  and the ARK ROYAL   will be given a major refit in Devonport to enable her to operate/both
both these aircraft until 197h/5.     The gradualrundown of the Fleet Air Arm will he carefully arranged in order to give adequate alternative career prospectsto officers and ratings who have served the Navy sowell.     Details are being promulgated to the Fleet.Canb e r r gggR ejela ceiqent39.     The key to the deterrent power of our armed forces is our ability to obtain early warning of an enemy&apos;intentions through reconnaissance, ana to strike at&apos;his offensive forces from a distance in case of need.     Since the early 1950s this role has been assigned to the Canberra aircraft which cannot safely continue aft1970.     By the later 1970s, we intend that the Anglo/French variable geometry aircraft should begin to takeover this and other roles.     Both operationally andindustrially this aircraft is the core of our long-termaircraft programme.     But if the RAF is not to belacking in a most critical part of its capability forsome five years, some arrangement must be made forbridging the gap.     We have therefore decided to buy50 of the F 111A aircraft from the United States on credit terms spread up to 1977.     Until the Anglo/Frenchvariable geometry aircraft is available, the V-bomberswill supplement them in the strike role, since theaircraft will cease to form part of our nuclear strategicforces when the POLARIS submarines come Into service.U-0.     There is no other aircraft available by 1970which can match the performance of the F 111A,particularly in reconnaissance.     The only twocompetitors were a possible development of the FrenchMirage IV, with a Rolls-Royce Spey engine which would/give-1 8-
-19-give this high-level nuclear bomber for temperateclimates the capacity for low-level conventionalstrike in tropical climates, or a developed version of the British Buccaneer 2.     We ruled out the formeron grounds of delivery date,  cost and performance;the latter would have come too late into service and could not compare in performance with the F 111A.Neither of these aircraft is comparable with theF 111A in the reconnaissance role.i+1 o    We have made arrangements to obtain a fixedprice ceiling for the F 111A aircraft which shouldmean a cost per aircraft of less than one thirdithe figure .that  would have applied to a similarnumber of the TSR 2.     We are guaranteedfull delivery of the 50 P 111As by the 1st January 1970.Moreover, we have taken steps to ensure that the foreign exchange cost of the P 111A will he offset almost completely by sales of British equipment.1+2,    In particular the American Government has agreed to remove all the price differentialsoperating against sales of British defence equipment in the United. States, so that British firms maycompete on equal terms in the American militarymarket.     As a first step the American Governmentis inviting tenders from British firms for the constructionof naval auxiliaries to a value of some /50m.1+3.    The French Government have been informed of our decision.     We have given them our;firm assurances that it will not affect the Anglo-French programme forthe development of the variahle geometry aircraft or for the development of a short range grouncl-attackaircraft known as the Jaguar./Fighter \x
-20-FJ-jghber and Grojond jjttacl^A ir era ftkU-o     The RAF&apos;s present fighter aircraft are theJavelin and Lightning.     In the next few years,  theJavelin will disappear as more Lightnings come into service.kd.     The ground-attack and short-range Army-supportaircraft is the Hunter, which will have to be replaced&quot;oy 1970.     When we saw in early 19S5 that Itsreplacement, the P. 115I4, would be too costly and cometoo late into service, we abandoned the project.We planned to use instead a combination of AmericanPhantoms and the British VTOL P. 1127.     This decision is now confirmed*     We shall later be taking a strikeversion of the Anglo/French Jaguar so as to releasePhantoms for the rejplacement of the Lightning.
-21 -Maritime Reconnaissanceij.60     Our plans are as announced last year.     Thelong-range maritime reconnaissance force consists ofShackletons 2 and 3.     The Shackleton 2s are to hereplaced hy a version of the Comet specially developed for the maritime role.     There is now a firm productioncommitment for this aircraft which will come into service at the end of the 1960s,Air Transport47.     Our strategy will rely increasingly on airmobility as our tenure of overseas bases grows moretuicertain.     The only change to the existing plans forthe strategic transport force is the use of someC130s to make good shortcomings in the performance ofthe Belfast.     We shall make a substantial improvementin our helicopter lift.Industrial Implications for the Aircraft Industry48.     The programme provides for continued productionin the United Kingdom of the Lightning, Belfast,VC.10, Buccaneer, Andover, Basset and Jet Provost.Apart from the C.130 and the P111A, all the aircraft for which specific new types are proposed will heequipped with British engines, and the British share in the production of the Phantom has reached 1+5%.The Ministry of Defence will also he paying the Britishaerospace industry about  130m. a year over the next10 years for spares, maintenance and repair work.Though there will he no further development of theBuccaneer 2 beyond fitting the air-to-ground missileAJ.168, there will he major new aircraft programmes forBritish industry in the Anglo-French variable geometryaircraft, and Anglo-French Jaguar strike and. traineraircraft,  the P.1127 and the maritime Comet./This programme
/As far as-22-k9o     This programme should provide sufficient support to enable the aircraft industry to develop in thelong term on the lines proposed in the report of the plowden Committee,     Its adoption will bring the totalsavings on the 10-year programme we inherited in &quot;\96li.to about  1,200m.Home Defence&quot;-ill -    IL -- ii - im m50,      We have completed a review of home defence.We have decided to restrict our civil defence preparations to those which would be likely to contribute significantlyto national survival.     Our plans were announced tothe House on 2nd February,     We have also decided toestablish a Home Defence Force to supplement in theevent of nuclear attack the substantial numbers ofregulars and reserve forces which would normally be inthis country.     Details of this force were given to theHouse on the same date,IV CONCLUSION&apos;        .........        &quot;    I   &quot;III&quot;51 ,      What then    is the outcome of our review so far?    ,We have planned a reduction in the tasks which weforesee in the 1970s, and we have taken decisions about our equipment, and about our regular and reserve forces9so that they match our commitments.     As a result, weshall have got within about  50m. of our target of  2,0Q0moWe are satisfied that we shall be able to close theremaining gap? though we do not believe it would be wise to take final decisions now on the precise means of doing so.     We have always recognised that the reviewmust be a continuing process and that the exact way inwhich we achieve our final savings must hinge on theresolution of the unknown quantities in our equations,,
-23-52...     As far as commitments are concerned, we shall heable to keep our contribution in Europe at roughly itspresent level, provided that some means is found of meeting the foreign exchange costs;    in the Middle East,we shall give up the base at Aden and disengage our-selves until we have reached the hard core of our obligations to CENTO and States in the Persian G-ulf;in the Par East we intend to play a substantial and constructive role in keeping the peace, always in close collaboration with our allies.     But some realisticlimitations must be applied to the scale and nature ofour military effort there.53*     The forces which we shall get with the reduceddefence budget will be modern, flexible and effective.We shall possess, with our aircraft and polaris submarines, substantial nuclear power to contribute to international arrangements.     Our forces in Europe willenable us to share fully in maintaining the politicalsolidarity of NATO.     We shall be able to cover all our defence and internal security tasks arising inprotected and dependent territories, and to supportUnited Nations operations if required.     The nuclear-powered submarines, the Type 82 destroyers and theP111A and Phantom aircraft will be among the mostadvanced military equipment in the world and will actas a strong deterrent to limited war.     Our Army units,helicopters, frigates and amphibious forces will have great value in the day to day task cf keeping the peaces/In short
-2k-5k *      In short, we have &quot;been able to make significantsavings of money and foreign exchange in return for acomparatively small reduction of our militarycapacity.     At the same time, we think that, withoutsacrificing speed or mobility, we can relax the strain on our forces once the pattern of our commitments hasbeen finally adjusted.     If the price of defencetoday is high, at least we shall be getting value for money.
