CONFIDE INITIALDRAFT WHITE PAPERLEASEHOLD REFORM IN ENGLAND AND wales the Purpose1o    The aim of leasehold reform is to adjust the social and legal relations of landowners and leaseholders on a fair and justbasis.   Leasehold has &quot;been a subject of social concern forgenerationso     It has worked unfairly, to the advantage of thelandowner and to the detriment of the leaseholder, because thelandowner is entitled to take, free of charge, the house and improvements created wholly by and at the expense of the succession of lessees. In the last century or so, landlordshave imposed inequitable terms upon leaseholders who wished to&quot;build homes for the growing urban population, and since 1882*.there have &quot;been many unsuccessful attempts to remedy this basicinequityo   More recently, the Landlord and Tenant Act 195^allowed the leaseholder to continue in occupation only under theterms of a statutory tenancy and that only at a rack rent.   Atthe same time it produced the unexpected result of depreciating idrastically the value of the landlord&apos;s interest.   This Actfailed to cut at the root of the problem, which is to recognise the leaseholder&apos;s right to the buildings and to entitle him to buy the freehold,2,    The Government believes that a just solution of the leaseholdproblem must recognise the occupying leaseholder as the owner of the buildings.   The fundamental premise is that the occupyingleaseholder continues to own the buildings and that the land-owner &apos;s entitlement is consequently no more than a fair groundrent.   Although this will involve a readjustment in the contractualrelations of landowner and leaseholder, the result will be toplace them on an equal footing.
3.    Three circumstances emphasise the need for immediate action.First, most people buy their house on mortgage and. many arelikely to suffer from the leasehold system.   A purchaser on mortgage may pay a virtually freehold price for a lease with agood many years to run hut as he reaches the end of his mortgageterm he will feel a sharpening sense of injustice.   He will realise that after he has discharged the mortgage he will have an interest far less than that which he bought and on which a subsequent purchaser may not get a mortgage.    This is the realitynow confronting many ov/ner occupiers who purchased their houseson setting up home immediately after the War.    Second, in SouthWales and in some English areas, in Victorian days, houses had tohe &quot;built on leasehold terms.    These leases are beginning to fallin and such householders are experiencing the harshness of the leasehold system.   Third, an increasing number of houses for ov/neroccupation are being provided on leasehold terms.     Often, the newlandlords seek to exploit the housing shortage in order to makethe maximum profit from their investments.   They have invested inthe right to receive money by way of an annual payment in the formof a aground rent.    It is surely right to protect householdersfrom such exploitation by giving them the right to purchase the freehold at a fair price.The PlanA.    The (government is, therefore, introducing a Bill to giveleaseholders with an original long lease greater security and toenable them to acquire the freehold on fair terms.   The Bill isbased on the principle that the land belongs in equity to thelandowner and the house belongs in equity to the occupyingleaseholder.   It follows that the leaseholder will have the rightto retain his. house after the lease expires and the right toenfranchise his lease.-2-CONF8DENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ,     g??Qualified Leaseholders5o     In view of the nature of the transactions during the lease,the leaseholder who lives in his house has a greater claim to enlarge his interest than the leaseholder who (like the land-owner) is concerned in the property only as an investment.   Inorder to come within the scope of the legislation a leaseholderwill have to satisfy two conditions:-   (i)   he must hold a lease,originally granted for more than 21 years at a ground-rent, of a house the rateable value of which does not exceed the Rent Actlimits ( 400 in London,  200 elsewhere);   and (ii) he must heoccupying the house as his residence and must have done socontinuously for at least the last 5 years.    For this purpose,any period during which he may have occupied the house as a rack-rent tenant &quot;before acquiring the lease will not count.6.    These conditions do not have to he satisfied at the timewhen the Bill &quot;becomes law.   A leaseholder will come within thescope of the legislation if he satisfies the conditions at anytime in the future, whether the lease was originally grantedii&quot;before or after the legislation.7o     In accordance with the assurance given on behalf of theG-overnment by the Minister of Housing and Local Government on 8th December 1964, any leaseholders whose leases expired after that date and who when the Bill becomes law are still occupyingtheir houses, on whatever terms, will be brought within the scheme.8.     Leasehold flats are not included in the proposals because itis almost impossible, in the present state of the&apos;law of landlord and tenant, to devise satisfactory covenants to govern freeholdflats.   This general problem is complex and it cannot properly be dealt with in the narrower frame of this legislation.    For thisreason the Government will consider the difficulties of flat ownerstogether with the recommendations of the Committee on Positive      ^Covenants Affecting^^^iftf^ce Co^ittee).
Security of Tenure9o    Although he acquires the right of enfranchisement, thequalified leaseholder may not want, or may not find itfinancially convenient, to enfranchise.   It would he wrong,however, to permit the landowner on the-expiry of.the lease toexpropriate the house, particularly if it is still in.good,condition.,-    The legislation will entitle a qualified leaseholderto..an extension of his-existing lease for a period of 50 yearsafter its.-present expiry date, hut with no right to a further extension thereafter... This provision should generally cover the -life of an existing.house. - - .-10.  The landlord, on the other hand, is entitled to a modern.. ...   -..ground. rent, for the -continued use of his land because the -present -ground, rent is usually fixed for the term of the lease. and.,, as-aresult., the. landlord may well he prejudiced hy the -fall- in itsreal value.   During the extension therefore the .ground rent.will -----..be a modern.-ground, rent attributable - to the site... -It will &quot;be.   .-- -,.such an. amount -as may.fairly reflect the site value..subject to-lts current&apos;&apos;use. by the leaseholder.   After 25 years,&apos; the groundrent will be reviewed &apos; to bring. it up to - date,Enfranchisement11.   Subject&apos;-to provision for special cases, a.qualified lease-holder will, have the. right -at anytime.....during.the lease to acquire the-freehold by.buying, out.-the...landlord compulsorily.     It isimportant to ensure that the price paid -for&apos; enfranchisement is afair price.&apos; But... present market prices reflect the- position&quot; underthe-present law-which is inequitable to the leaseholder and..theprice, for enfranchisement must accordingly be based not on -present market values but on. the., value of the. land itself,  .including any development&apos;value attaching to it.     The price ofenfranchisement must be.calculated in accordance, with the principlethat in equity the bricks and mortar belong to the qualifiedleaseholder
12cIt followso provide, that where thereis no development value, and often there will not &quot;be, the &quot;price for enfranchisement is a fair equivalent of the landlord1 s   279interest in the land for its current use by the leaseholder.The landlord will be entitled to receive on enfranchisement afair price being an amount not exceeding the value of thefreeholders interest in the site, subject to the lease and its extension of 50 years, and completely disregarding the value ofthe buildings on reversion.13c     In many cases consideration of development value will notarise;   and it is really material only in the last phase of theleaseo     Although the leaseholder under the terms of the leasemay not apparently have any development value, his ability toprevent the landlord from gaining possession effectively giveshim a share, and the full development value in the land is thusat present divided between the landlord and the leaseholderbroadly by the amount of deferment which the leaseholder canimpose.   But of course with a few years to go, most of the value is with the freeholder.lit-.   Where there is development value, the fair price will includealso the value to the freeholder of the development rights asat the date of enfranchisement and without regard to theextension of the lease.   On this part of the price the freeholderwill be subject to betterment levy assessed in accordance withthe Land Commission Bill now before Parliament0     In some casesdevelopment rights already have a considerable value and the,fair price will be comparatively high.   But if a qualifiedleaseholder prefers not to enfranchise he will not be at risk*   This means that site value will be assessed aspart of the value of the land and buildings existingat the time of the enfranchisement and on theassumption that the covenants of the lease have been complied with and that material development would not

Certain cases call for special treatment.(a) IandComjni^sJ^onQualified leaseholders will be able to enfranchiselong leases held from the Land Commission but if the lease is on crown hold terms, the freehold, will be onthe same terms and will thus reserve to the Commissionall future development value.(b) Local AuthoritiesIf a qualified leaseholder holds from a localauthority and the local authority needs the site for early development, the appropriate Minister (usuallythe Minister of Housing and Local Government or theSecretary of State for wales) will have discretion to bar enfranchisement, since it would be absurd thatthe leaseholder should be able to enfranchise onlyto have the property compulsorily purchased soonafterwards.     In all other cases a qualifiedleaseholder will be able to enfranchise against alocal authority but he will not be able to acquire the development rights.    The price will not,/therefor
include arv^Ieilerl? oi^deve\c&quot;development value &quot;but if thelocal authority later re-acquires the property thecompensation paid will he limited to what the leaseholder had purchased,, the value of the land for existing use, and also the &quot;bricks and mortar valueof the buildings and improvements.    A qualifiedleaseholder who holds from a local authority will inall cases have the right to an extension of his leasefor 50 years.Other Public AuthoritiesQualified leaseholders holding from other public authorities (including for this purpose universitiesas well as government departments, New Town Authoritiesand statutory undertakings) will have the same rights as those holding from local authorities.Crown Estates and Royal Duchies:   National TrustArrangements v/ill be made to enable qualifiedleaseholders holding leases under the Crown Estateor from the Duchies of Cornwall or Lancaster also to enjoy the same benefits as leaseholders holding from local authorities.   In such cases, when leases are granted on special terms designed to ensure thepreservation of houses of special architectural,historic or amenity value these will be excludedfrom the legislation.   In the same way, provision will be made to exclude such property as that heldinalienably by the National Trust.Housing Associations : 1 housing associations normally let houses on shortleases at a rack-rent, so they v/ill seldom haveleaseholders qualified under the Bill.   But in any-7-COMiTOENTIAL
case, since Housing Associations exist only for the&quot;benefit of their tenants it would not be appropriate to give rights against them under this scheme.,Nothing in the legislation will prejudice any powersof compulsory acquisition belonging to local andpublic authorities under other Acts,Rights of Freeholders17c    During the term of the original lease the landlord willhave the right to refuse either enfranchisement or an extensionof the lease if(a) he intends on the expiry of the lease to occupy the house by himself or his family and his hardshipwould be greater than the leaseholders if this intention were frustrated,or - as&apos; the Lord. Chancellor * would pref ef - 4    - -(b) he intendstafter the expiry of the lease to redevelopthe propertyc18.     If the landlord succeeds in doing this he will be liableto pay compensation to the leaseholder when the lease expires:this compensation will be the value of the leasehold interest which the leaseholder would have acquired if the lease had been extended for 50 years - that is, in round terms, the bricksand mortar value.19.    Where a leaseholder has not enfranchised and the leasehas been extended for 50 years, the landlord will have the rightat any time during the extension to obtain possession if heshows that he genuinely intends to redevelop the property onpaying compensation to the leaseholder equal to the value ofthe leasehold interest as it then exists. ^
CONFIDENTIAL &quot;;     28320.   Any dispute about the freeholder&apos;s rights will be decided by a judicial tribunal.Covenants on Enfranchisement21o   Most of the covenants under the existing lease concern therelations between the landlord and leaseholder and will automatically and rightly disappear when the lease is enfranchised,But where there is more than one leasehold property in the samefreehold ownership it is common to provide by way of leaseholdcovenants for matters of mutual advantage as between theleaseholders themselves affecting essential services and amenity.Neither the leaseholder who enfranchises nor his neighbour will want to lose these mutual advantages;   and the Bill will ensurethat, where they are important, they can in one way or anotherbe preserved.Estate Management22.   There are some comprehensively managed leasehold estateswhere enlightened management contributes greatly to the well-being of the residents by maintaining the character of the estate.     It would not be fair to deny to leaseholders on suchestates the right of enfranchisement, but it would be equallyunfair to other residents on the estate if the exercise ofthis right prevented the benefits of comprehensive managementfrom being any longer effective.   The Government propose that,if the estate is recognised by the appropriate Minister as awell managed estate, enfranchisement will be subject to an agreed scheme for continued estate management, with provisionfor reference to arbitration in the event of disagreement.Chain of Leases23.    The qualified leaseholder will not always hold his leasedirect from the freeholder.   He may sometimes be at the end ofa chain of intermediate leases.     He will be empowered toenfranchise by extinguishing all the superior interests and confidential
CONFIDENTIAL ,     2Sithere will be provision for the apportionment of the price ofenfranchisement among the owners of these different interests.If the leaseholder does not enfranchise but extends his leasefor 50 years, then the intermediate interests will disappearas the intermediate leases expire and then the leaseholder willhold his extended lease direct from the freeholder.Summary2Ko     The Government thus intends to achieve a just and lastingsolution of the leasehold problem by clearly defining the properinterests of the landowner and the leaseholder living in his own home;   by ending the basic defect of the system that the dwellingprovided and maintained by the leaseholder or his predecessorsin title passes to the landowner without compensation beforethe end of its useful life:   and by giving the leaseholder theright to become on fair terms the owner of his home.
