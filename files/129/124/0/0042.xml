The Ministerial review, announced last April, has been thorough and complete, and all relevant information is available.2.      Publication of the White Pa/per or statement in the Commons hasbeen fore shad owed &quot;early in the New Year&quot;.    Pressure from both sides of the House is growing.3.     Speculation as to the Governments intentions, much of itinaccurate, and all of it damaging, is widespread.    Denialsa.re not possible until the policy is published.4.     By contrast the Opposition policy in favour of a fourthcommercial television channel and local commercial radio has.been made clear.5.      The deteriorating state of BBC finances is well known and until a firm statement about the licence fee is made the suspicionwill grow (and be encouraged to grow) that the delay inpublication arises from a reluctance to announce the further increase of  1 or more, which the BBC are seeking.6.      There is Press and public interest in the forthcoming &quot;white paper and especially in the possibility of extending hours of television broadcasting and the prospects for colour.7.      The radio pirate issue is a continuing nuisance and source ofpolitical embarrassment and will remain so until theGovernment has produced its own plans for the future of sound broadcasting.-1-
8.     The White Paper, if it included a reference to the use of BBCtelevision for the University of the Air, would give credibilityto our intentions with regard to it.    In this connection theestablishment of the community stations also offers a limitedscope for providing an outlet for ouch programmes.I recommend that the Chairmen of the BBC and the IT A should be consulted about the provisions of the White Paper before it goes to theprinter and that I should report back, if necessary.A.

DRAFT WHITE PAPERBEtoADCAS^ING1.     On taking office, the Government succeeded to a number ofunresolved problems in the field of broadcasting.    The most urgentwas the problem of BBC finance.    Another was the problem of colour television and a third the question of allocating the fourthchannel.    The Government were also committed to the idea of creating a University of the Air that would offer new opportunities -ties for- those who have been denied access to higher education.There was also the question of local sound broadcasting, whichhad not previously been resolved.2.     For all these reasons, and because all issues of broadcasting policy are to some extent inter-related, the Government decidedto undertake a comprehensive review.    This has been in progress for over a year and has now been completed.Principles governing the formulation of policy.     Given the problems awaiting it, and the possibilities for thefuture, the Government have approached their task in the light ofthe six principles laid down during the debate on May 13th, 1965.A.     The principles were.0(i)   A profound belief in the growing importance of radio and television to the community and the world.(ii)   A wish to see television and radio expand, as rapidly as national resources permit, to meet important nationalneeds and to develop still further their potential for education, information and entertainment.(iii)   A recognition that technological changes have opened    M.P new possibilities for international programme exchanges and. colour television.(Iv)   A determination to uphold and entrench the principleof public service in all future television and radio dovelop-mo nt , this principle to be reflected in its purposes, in theallocation of channels, in the maintenance of programmestandards, in public accountability without politicalinterference, and in the integrity and independence of programme provision.(v)   A desire to permit the greatest possible freedom and scope for creative talent to express itself througk radio and television, and hence, the encouragement of a diversityof outlets.(vi)   A readiness to consider various methods by whichbroadcasting can be financed, including (alone or in com-bination) broadcast licences, exchequer ,grants, localgovernment grants and revenue from advertising Lmderproper supervision.- 2 -ANNEX B
5,     Given these -principles, which the Government believe command general acceptance, the&quot;proposals contained in this White Papermust be taken and seen together as a whole rather than as separatesolutions to individual problems.    The most important considera-tion throughout has been the listeners and viewers for whom theservices are provided.    With this in mind the Government have thought it right tc entertain and consider all the variousideas and proposals put to then on the development, and organisa-tion, of broadcasting services.THE FINANCES OF THE BBC6.     The BBC were committed by decisions of the previous administration, taken following the report of the PilkingtonCommittee, tc undertake major expansion of their services,namely:-(a) BBC.2(b) self-contained television services for Scotland and Wales(c) more hours for sound broadcasting(d) more adult education programmes and    (e)    a start on colour television.Except for colour television, these decisions, which were welcomedon all sides when they were announced, have been implemented.7.     The understanding on which the BBC proceeded to carry out a programme of expansion and development was that they would be afforded sirfficient Income to finance adequate services.8.     In October, 196k, the BBC informed the Government that theCorporation^ deficit in the Hone Services would amount to some 125n. by April, 1969? if nothing were done to increase their income and no other conpensatory steps were taken.    Accordingly,they asked that the combined sound and television licence feeshould be raised from  A to  6, and the sound only licence feefrom  1 to  1 5s. Od., the increases to take effect on1st April, 1965.    It was, of course, the Government1s duty first tosatisfy themselves that the increase sought by the Corporationwas justified..   As, however, the BBCs deficit was rapidly increasing, immediate action was necessary.    So, pending the outcome of their comprehensive survey of broadcasting policy -including a rigorous enquiry into the BBCs finances - theGovernment authorised an increa.se in the combined licence fee from 4 to  5; and in the sound only fee from  1 to  1 5s. Od.    Bothincreases took effect on 1st August, 1965.The remaining deficit9.     The Government have completed their review of the BBCsfinances.   In the course of the review, they have satisfied themselves that the Corporation operate with efficiency and economy.    The Government review confirmed also that the estimatedgrowth in the BBCs expenditure derived very largely from theadditional commitments they were asked to undertake.    There is thus little scope for savings except through drastic cuts in theservices provided and in course- of provision.    Cuts of this kind would restrict the range and lower the quality of the services of broadcasting provided by the BBC for the viewing and listeningpublic.    The Government reject this course.- 3 -
10.    If the Corporation&apos;s commitments are to remain unchanged, andif no further steps are taken to provide additional income, the overall financial&quot;prospect with which they would he faced is thattheir cumulative deficit on the Home Services which stood at some 5m. on 31st March, 1965, can he expected to rise to about  17m.by the end of 1966-67 and to more than  30m. by the end of1967-68.Meeting the problem11.    Traditionally the BBC have always been financed by the licence fee system.    This well-established constitutional device, acceptedby the public, has provided an assured income and protected the bbc from detailed control and outside intervention.12.    Until recently the BBC have enjoyed a rising income becausethe number of television households has grown so rapidly.However now that near saturation has been reached the BBC cannotrely upon sufficient revenue from this source to meet their rising costs.    In the future far more regular and sharp increases in thelicence fee would be necessary, unless some other kind ofrevenue were found.Borrowing13.    Under the BBCs Charter, the Corporation^ borrowing powers are limited toJ- 10m. for temporary banking accommodation; and 20m. for capital purposes.For the BBC, borrowing does not generate additional revenue, butonly increases interest charges.    It does not, therefore,  offer apermanent solution to the BBCs financial problem.    The Governmentreject the view that the answer to the Corporation^ difficultiesis to increase their borrowing powers. , ,An exchequer quer sub sidy11*.   An alternative proposal has been considered under which thelicence fee would remain the basic source of revenue but supplementaryhelp would be forthcoming from the Exchequer.    The BBC are unwilling to accept this arrangement since they believe it would make themliable to the same sort of detailed control now exercised overGovernment Departments.    The Government also reject this proposal,both because it is incompatible with the independence of theCorporation and because it would involve either a substantial increase in the level of taxation or a reduction in importantexpenditure by other Departments. . .Advertising revenue in all BBC programmes15.    A third possibility is that the BBC should be financed in wholeor in part by commercial advertisements in all their programmes.This would certainly yield a substantial income.    However it wouldbe entirely contrary to the public service traditions on which the bbc has been built and would be incompatible with the duties expected of, and met by, successive Boards of Governors.    It would destroy the BBC as we know it and the Government absolutely reject it asa solution.- A -
Autorag^tic licence increases16.    If these three solutions are excluded the BBC must eithercut their services drastically, receive regular substantial increases in the licence foe or find some other form ofrevenue.    On tor of the extra  1 granted in august 1965 afurther increase of  1 would he required in 1966.    If the BBC wereto utilise extended hours of broadcasting which the government intend to authorise and were to bo asked to undertake the task ofestablishing a complete network of local stations, a further increase of at least 10s. would bo necessary relatively soon and perhaps another  1 in 1969-70.    The Government cannot accept theidea that the public should be asked to pay increases of this order, which would weigh heavily on those least able to affordit.17.    The Government has therefore decided that they cannotauthorise any further increase in the basic licence fee of  5before 1968.    the BBC must plan on that assumption, and exercise the strictest economy.18.    However the Government are prepared to consider other ways in which BBC revenue might be strengthened in the intervening period, and beyond.New sources of revenue for the BBC(i)    Now measures againstlicence evasion19.    It has been reliably estimated that of the gross revenueamounting to  80m. a year due   from licences, some 9m. is lost through evasion, most of this arising from the useof unlicensed television   sots.    This cannot ,be allowed tocontinue..    If measures to counter evasion are improved it would bring increased revenue without an increase in the licence.20.    The   Postmaster General has already strengthened the workof his Department against evasion, in co-operation with the BBC.Work has begun on the possibility of transferring the licencerecords on to computers, which could reduce administrative costs and make evasion easier to detect.21.    The Government has now decided to go further.    Consultationshave begun with the retailors and rental companies to see whatcontribution they can make towards dealing with this problem.The Government hopes to find some way of securing the notificationby retailors of television sets sold and of seeing to it thatrented sets are properly licensed.    Any nc-cessary legislation will be introduced as soon as practicable.22,    It is impossible to estimate exactly what extra revenue thiswill bring in.    The measures proposed may take effect relativelyslowly.    But the not yield from licence fees might (be raised bysome  2m. in the first full year rising to  7m. or more after about four years.(ii)   A supplementary licence fee for colour television receivers23.   When colour television begins in Britain extra expenditure willbe incurred by the BBC.    It would not be fair to ask viewersgenerally, the majority of whom will not have colour televisionsets, to boar the whole cost through their ordinary televisionlicences.    It is not unreasonable to ask those who can afford to- 5 -N
o s iipay the high cost of buying or renting colour television tomake a special contribution by means of a supplementary licence fee.The Government have decided to fix this supplementary fee at  3.(iii)   University of the Air television programmes2k.    The Government would wish the first University of the Airprogrammes to be broadcast by BBC.2 using some peak and some non-peak hours.    In addition repeats of these programmes might be transmitted on BBC.1 to serve a nation-wide   audience in non-peakhours.    The Government is now considering how these University ofthe Air programmes might be financed.    But as and when they areintroduced using BBC transmitters,, payment will be made at cost tothe BBC for these facilities.(iv)   Engineering and construction work for community stations25.    The Government have decided to establish independent communitystations on a public service basis in a number of cities and towns.These stations&apos;will be self-financing and the BBC will bo in aposition to provide technical help in constructing and establishingthem on an agency basis in return for payment:.(v)   A national music programme26.    The Government believe that there is a demand for a continuousnational music programme in this country.    This is shown both by thepopularity of live music on the BBC and by the audiences thatlisten to and enjoy records.27.    A music programme of this kind, uninterrupted by drama, talksor features, could be provided by re-programming music nowprovided by the BBC so as to bring&apos; it all together on the nationalwavelength used by the Light Programme,    The present 3-1 hour gapduring the early hours of the morning might   also be filled withouttoo much difficulty.    Such a programme should not be confined by anymoans to pop music.28.    In addition to meeting a clear national need, such a musicnetwork would also provide a sustaining programme to which the local community stations could switch for re-transmission over their owntransmitters during periods of the day when they were not originatinglocal material. vi29.    A music programme of this type would of course appeal to amaximum audience throughout the day and night, and would certainlyattract very large numbers of listeners both nationally and locally,30.   ;This being so, the risks that controlled advertising inserted in it&apos; would operate to harm minority interests, would be minimised.The revenue thus obtained appears to offer a suitable and 1&apos;relatively harmless moans by v/hich BBC revenue could be supplemented.The Government is therefore prepared to explore with the BBC thepossibility of establishing a small public corporation, transmittingon the BBC wavelengths and transmitters, buying music, rentingfacilities from them and financing itself by selling advertisingtime so as to provide a national music network entirely separate from the BBC.    This national music network would then also be madeavailable as a sustaining programme for the community stationswhich are to be established.    In this way the BBC would be relieved of the present costs of running the Light Programme, and would receive a contractual income furnishing an additional source ofrevenue.    Organised on this basis there would be no advertising onany BBC programmes in sound or television.- 6 -
31.    Tho Government believes that the proposals described aboveoffer the twin advantages of helping to keep the BBC licence foewithin reason and preserving the public- service principles insound broadcasting.COLOUR TELEVISIONChoice of system32.    As the Postmaster General has already announced, hisTelevision Advisory Committee has recommended that colour televisionbe introduced on the 625-line standard only, using the PALsystem of transmission.33.    Tho Government accept this recommendation.    In doing so, theyrecord as a main consideration the expectation that the PALsystem will bo adopted in most western European countries.    The-possibility cannot altogether bo discounted that, at tho meetingof the International Radio Consultative Committee due to takeplace in Oslo in Juno of this year, another system might- againstpresent expectations - find general acceptance for common usethroughout&apos;Europe.    In that event, the Government would naturallyundertake to take this into account, and if necessary reconsider their decision.Lino standard3k.    The effect of the decision to confine colour tolevision tothe 625-line standard is that only BBC.2. will be able to transmit in colour intially.    However, the Government re-affirmtho decision of the previous administration that all programmes in UHF should be on the 625-lino standard and this will open thepossibility of colour in all future television channels.Timing of a start35.    Colour television is now developing rapidly in North America,has already started in Japan and some European countries have announced their intention to open a colour service noxt year.Unless Britain, which pioneered television, is to be loft out, anearly start should be made in this country as well.36.    The Government have of course had to take seriously intoaccount the demands on resources which a colour service wouldmake over the next few years.    Tho BBC have planned on the basis of only four hours of colour each week at the outset, rising to about ten hours a week within a year.    The additional cost to them of broadcasting colour on this scale would amount to some  1m. to  2m.a year.    Consumer expenditure on colour receivers, depending onthe number acquired, might rise to  100m. between now and 1970.However some of this expenditure would be counter-balanced by areduction of other forms of consumer expenditure by viewers buyingcolour sets.    The demand on skilled manpower is relatively small.37.    Tho case for an early start with colour is strong.    Theindustry is ready and anxious to go ahead.    They see export possi-bilities and foar the long-term consequences of excluding ourselvesfrom tho technology required for producing colour components.    the producers, directors and other creative people in television seecolour as a way of revitalising their work.    There are alsoopportunities for tho export of colour programmes made in Britain.38.    These arguments are, in the Government1s mind, sufficientlypowerful to justify a start.    Since it has been decided to conserveresources by not authorising a fourth television channel at present,the Government feel that a regular colour service should be started in the autumn of 1967.
* 9 A O3g.    Although tho programme contractors will not have access, intho short-terra, to d fourth channel on which colour programmescan he shown, they might he able to reach agreement with the BBCfor the showing on BBC.2 of any colour programmes that they mayproduce.    These colour programmes could carry the name of theprogramme contractor that made them and he paid for out of the supplementary colour licence fee.    They would not carry advertise-ments.    In this way those paying the supplementary licence feefor colour would get access more quickly to more colour programmesthan the BBC could themselves provide.    In addition the programme contractors would have a home market with which to sustain their export efforts for selling colour television programmes.LOCAL SOUND broadcasting the technical considerationsAO.    There is no frequency space for a general service of localsound hroadcasting in the highly congested medium and long wavebandscovered by the ordinary domestic receivers and transistor portablesets.    There is frequency space available, however, in the very high-frequency (VHF ) Band II; and, used intensively, under aco-ordinated national plan, this could provide for some 350 local stations.    Not all of these 350 locations would however coincide with considerable centres of population, but in practical t ermssome 200 towns and cities could be served.    A typical stationwould have a range of some five miles.   More than one station wouldbe needed to cover the largest centres of population.k1.    During the hours of daylight, when there is less congestion inthe medium waveband, some local sound transmissions on VHF  mightbe duplicated on medium wavelengths.    Some low power stations mightbe provided in such a way as not to interfere with existing stationstransmitting the BBCs present sound services (and those of othercountries).    The advantage would be that broadcasts of the local stations could then he received by people without VHF  receivers.The purpose of a service of local broadcastingIh2.    Though the country is already well served by the national and regional sound services provided by the BBC, the Government believethat local sound radio could bring a new and revitalising elementinto broadcasting and make a valuable contribution to community life.Properly used, it would also have a useful part to play in education.A3.    The Pilkington Committee concluded that worthwhile local sound broadcasting stations would transmit &quot;for a sufficient part of the broadcasting day, /material/ of particular interest to the localityserved by that station rather than to other localities.&quot;   In theWhite Paper of July 1962 the previous Administration said they agreed &quot;that the justification for local sound broadcasting wouldbe tho provision of a service genuinely &quot;local&quot; in &quot;character&quot;&quot;.The Government share this view.kk.    It would be a misconception of the role of local sound broad-casting to expect of it a service limited to playing continuous&quot;pop&quot; music throughout tho day.    In the first place, this would be to ignore its main purpose of providing an essentially local service.Moreover, local stations would be liable to pay for copyright and to observe the agreed amounts of &quot;needle-tine&quot; negotiated with thephonographic industry with the support of the Musicians&apos; Union.- 8 -
Organisation and financeij.p.    In considering how the service should be constituted, organised and financed, the Government have adopted a single practicalcriterion; how best to serve the essential purposes of localbroadcasting.    It is against this background that the Governmenthave considered the various claims to provide such a service.BBC stations1+6.    The BBC have expressed a willingness to mount a pilot scheme,within the revenue from the present 25s. sound licence fee, insome nine centres.    The Corporation have already undertaken aseries of close-circuit experiments which have shown the expertiseand professional enthusiasm which the BBC would bring to the provisionof a service.    But the BBC is a unitary structure, organised-primarily to provide services on the national scale.    Though theCorporation have expressed their readiness to afford managers oflocal stations a great degree of freedom from day-to-day controlfrom Broadcasting House, nevertheless the Government are notpersuaded that a national organisation which alroads^ has a monopolyin the provision of sound   broadcasting is best fitted to providenew local services.    In addition it would not, in the governments view, be right to ask people living in areas which could neverreceive BBC local stations to pay for then through licence fees.Nor, in the present state of BBC finances, would it be right toimpose fresh and expensive commitments on then.    The government do not therefore propose to take up the BBCs offer to conduct apilot scheme.Commercial stationshi.    The expectation is that, for many years to cone, there would be only one station   serving any particular locality.    Such a stationwould have a nonopoly for the sale of local advertising tine.Moreover, it would be the principal objective and duty of commercialcompanies to secure a good return on the money invested in then.    TheG-overanent believe that t,,is objective and duty would prove quiteincompatible with the need to provide a service which would findexpression for the particular interests and tastes of the nany widelydiffering communities.    There is another important consideration tobe borne in mind.    If a fully developed service of local commercialradio stations were to be established the advertising revenuediverted from the local newspapers night endanger the survival ofmany of then, which would detract from community life.    Moreover,if to avert that result local newspapers were themselves allowed to :own the local stations a local nonopoly of local news and comment -would be established with even greater risks to local democracy.Accordingly, the Government reject the proposal that a service should beprovided by cornercial companies.Community stationshS,   The Government conclude that another solution is to be preferred namely, that local community stations night be established and operated on a public service footing under the control oflocal broadcasting authorities composed of people drawn from the local community and sufficiently representative of it.    They have there-fore decided to authorise the experimental establishment of stationson this basis.    The Postmaster General will be prepared to considerapplications for the authorisation of local sound broadcasting stations bron bodies of local people who will constitute themselves&quot;to sponsor an application and can satisfy him as to their suitabilityand conpetence.    The general conditions under which the PostmasterGeneral will be prepared to authorise such stations v/ill be publishedshortly.    The Government would particularly welcome applications fromthe headquarter towns of the new economic planning Regions,
Financing of community stationsA9.    The local broadcasting authorities would be charged with thewhole responsibility for finding the necessary finance, bothcaoital and revenue.    A worthwhile service must be able to count on&quot;regular and sufficient income.    Though the Government hope thata sense of pride of community, especially among local authorities,would lead local interests to contribute, by gift or subscription,sufficient financial and other help for their stations, they recognise that this may not suffice.    The broadcasting authorities would therefore be empowered to sell advertising time on condition that the amount of advertising would bo no more than was needed to finance the service and was strictly controlled in volume and character.50.    Each station would be required to transmit a proper proportionof educational programmes.    Some of those would no doubt be provided on behalf of local education authorities, colleges and universitieswho would in that case provide or finance the programme.    the stations would also provide an outlet for sound programmes produced in connection with the University of the Air.    They would not be financed by the rates except insofar as local education authoritiesdecided to use them for educational programmes.    The government believe that these stations could and should develop in such a way as to become patrons and ;.ustainers of local cultural life andthus stimulate the arts, drama and live music.51.    The role of local authorities in launching these local stations could be a major one.    But in matters of programmecontent the stations would not bo subject to any local authoritycontrol; in that respect, following the practice of independencefrom Parliamentary control enjoyed by the BBC and the ITA.Effect on the pressj52.   Many local newspapers which saw the prospect of commerciallocal sound broadcasting as posing a throat to their continued existence can take some reassurance from these proposals.    It isto be a condition of the establishment of a local station that itmust not be profit-making; and the Government are satisfied that,with this safeguard, such stations could play a useful part inenriching community life without unfair competition.    In addition is certainly visualised that leaders of the local press wouldbe appropriate people to serve on looal broadcasting authorities.Moreover, local stations would almost certainly require and pay for services of news and information supplied by local newspapers.Term of the initial licences53... In the Government1 s view, four yaars should be enough for the initial period of the licence and agreement concluded with each authority. Towards the end of the period the working of the experiments would be reviewed and the constitution and organisationof the service on a longer-term basis decided in the light of experience,    A decision of this importance, involving as it does the beginnings of an entirely new type of broadcasting organisationbased on public service principles with a nixed revenue, ought to be reviewed at such a stage in its life.
A NATIONAL BROADCASTING COI5MISSION5k.    Broadcasting is developing so fast that Connittees of Enquiryat twelve-year intervals do not cone sufficiently frequently toadvise on all tiro problems that arise in this field.    For thisreason the Government have decided to establish a NationalBroadcasting Commission with the following terms of reference&quot;To advise the Postmaster General on such questions ashe may refer to it relating to the domestic broadcasting services of the United Kingdom, and insofar as the BBC andITA services are concerned tho Channel Islands and the Isle ofMan&quot;.The problems of the BBC1s external services are different in kindfrom those of tho domestic services and it is not contemplated thatthese would bo referred to the Commission.55.    The chairman and members will be selected on the basis of theindividual contributions they could make and would not be chosen inany sense as representatives of the public in general or anysectional interests.    They will bo appointed by the PostmasterG-enoral who proposes to invite, besides the independent members,the Vice-Chairman of the BBC and Deputy Chairman of the ITA tojoin the Commission.56.    The main functions of the Commission would be to advise on major questions of broadcasting policy.    Though it would be open tothe Postmaster General to refer to the Commission broad and general questions relating to programme standards, he would not refer to it,nor would it entertain, individual complaints about particularprogrammes.    The Commission would report to the Postmaster general who would present its report to Parliament for consideration and whowould take account of it in his major decisions.    The Commission&apos;advice to the Postmaster General would not itself be- made binding on tho broadcasting authorities, whose discretion in the/ dischargeof their responsibilities must remain unqualified.    The commission would however provide a valuable and independent source of adviceentirely free of Government influence upon issues of policy as andwhen they arise.    The broadcasting authorities, including the nowlocal broadcasting authorities, would certainly wish to take seriousaccount of this expression of opinion along with that expressed inParliament, the press and direct representations from members ofthe public.57.    In summary, the Commission&apos;s purpose would bo to provide theGovernment with advice on the issues of policy referred to it and to reinforce tho methods by which public opinion is brought to bearon tho broadcasting authorities; but it would neither displace thepresent agencies through which that opinion expresses itself, norderogate from the responsibility of the authorities for the programmesthey broadcast.HOURS OF BROADCASTING58.    The Government have considered the question of extended hoursof television broadcasting by tho BBC and the ITA.    Since the fourthnetwork is not to be allocated for the moment, there is a strong case for allowing existing channels to be used more fully.    In particular the ITA (having only one channel, as compared with the BBCs two),has a special claim for more hours.    There is also a public interesthere in that an increasing number of shift-workers and others miss theopportunity of viewing at peak hours and aro now deprived of anytelevision for part of the day.    There aro many housewives, invalidsand elderly people who are at homo during tho day and would enjoymore television.
- 12 -59.    The Government&apos;s conclusion is that while the PostmasterGeneral&apos;s powers of control over broadcasting hours must remain,the time has come for a considerable increase in the permittedhours.More educational broadcasting60.    The Government consider, however, that within the extendedhours a greater place should be found for educational programmes and they are therefore discussing with the broadcasting authorities the arrangements to provide for this and, in the case of .thoITA, to provide also for experiments within the terms of the television Act 1964, which allows the ITA to seek out educationalprogrammes from sources other than the programme companies.    Inthis way, tho ITA might develop still further its existing roleas &quot;publisher&quot; of programmes, in this case without the inter-vention of advertising matter.    These programmes would befinancedby the Authority itself, and would be non-commercial.THE ALLOCATION OP TEE FOURTH NETWORK61.    The Government have- given very careful consideration to thequestion of the fourth network.    Such a network if established and operated, whether by the programme contractors or a new public corporation, would involve the allocation of considerable capital resources.    The Government are not satisfied that it would be rightto take this decision at this Une while there a,ro still so manyhours unused on BBC.1 and 2 and the ITA.    Moreover experience maywell show that the University of the Air might need an outlet onthis network in peak hours.    It would clearly be wrong to allocateit for general programme use until this and other questions canbe resolved.    The fourth channel will therefore not be allocated for the time being.PAY TELEVISION62.    Under the previous administration licences were&quot;7issued to three companies authorising them to mount an experimental serviceof pay television.    All but one of the companies decided not toproceed with the experiments and the remaining company (PayTelevision Ltd.) began to provide a service in January, 1966.The Government will keep the experiment under review.CONCLUSION63.    The BBCs Charter and the Television Act expire in 1976.    TheGovernment believe that the developments outlined in this paper,and the later allocation of the fourth network, should set the pattern for the growth and expansion of broadcasting as a; public service for the remainder of the decade.    Insofar asfurther decisions will be required in the interim, the Governmentwill have the advice of the National Broadcasting Commission.
