Draft Vihite Paner.The^niy ersljy^ of^ t^e^ air the^ fj?urth AQ^^sipn A9jfcgp.yk1.     The Government has decided to establish a University of the Air, thatis to say, an open university providing special television and radioprogrammes, reinforced by correspondence courses, residential courses andtutorials, which will enable students to obtain degrees and other technical and professional qualifications.     The University will be set up as quickly as possible, and, since it will require a substantial share of a newtelevision service, the Government will authorise the construction of anadditional television network - the fourth network.     This will be anUltra High Frequency (UBP) service on the 625-line standard.2.     The Government propose to set up a public corporation which will have responsibility for the management of the fourth network^     It will be sharedbetween University of the Air programmes, and other programmes presented&apos;bythe corporation.     The University of the Air will be financed by students&apos;fees and sale of publications, as well as by direct Exchequer grant.     It isalso hoped to attract endowments as other Universities have done.     the network, to the extent that it is not used by the University of the Air,will be financed from advertising revenue.universities.ty^^ojrJcjig^ AirSgo^6. a^d. funjrtionsj^ and private^nisatipn3.     An informally constituted Advisory Committee whose members wereexperienced in higher education was called together in June, &quot;1965? and asked to consider the educational scope and functions of a University of theAir.     The report of this Committee, which is given in Appendix A, was accepted in principle by the Government.A.     The maim proposals for the University of the Air are these -(a) The University of the Air is to be established with its ownVice-Chancellor and Governing Body.     It will have its ownadministrative centre, and a nucleus of television studios, but will work in co-operation with local education authorities,educational bodies and establishments, and the broadcasting organisations.(b) It will offer primarily courses leading to degrees, butprofessional, technical, refresher and conversion courses willalso be included.-1-COMFIDENTBAL
(c) Courses Trill be so designed that students can obtain intermediatequalifications.     &quot;Credits&quot; will be awarded when a part or stage of a course is completed, and will lead to a nationally recognisedqualification.(d) There will be no prescribed entry qualifications.     Jill will be free, under guidance from tutors, to enter for courses, but thefilial degree qualifications will be of the same standard as thatof existing universities.(e) The television programmes will be broadcast for forty weeks ayear at peak viewing time, i.e, in the early or mid-evening onweek days, and, to meet the needs of shift workers and others who are not free in the evenings, programmes will also be broadcast during the day, including early morning, and at latenight and week-ends.(f) The framework of the organisation is outlined in Appendix C.(g) Departmental responsibility for the University of the Air, inview of the fact that its activities v/ill not be confined todegree work, aid that other than strictly university functions and arrangements will be involved, will rest with the Departmentof Education and Science, and not the University Grants Committee.So, too, the financing of the University of the Air will not besubject to advice from the University Grants Committee,Development of the fourth television network5.     It is estimated that it v/ill take about ten years to develop thefourth television network to the point where it covers all, or practically all, of the United Kingdom.     But the first transmissions are expected to start within two years.     Sufficient stations to cover the main industrial centres - approximately 70 per cent of the population - could beestablished within four years for a capital commitment of  8 - SB million.The proportion of the population within reach of the transmissions willprobably build up as follows -Year Percentage of population cpyered1968 56%1969 72^1970 71%1971 80$1972 Q2f01973 81$1974 Wo-2-
Ath February^ 1966-3-Costs6,     Excluding studios, the capital cost of the entire fourth network, interms of additional demand on resources, is estimated at  17 million.This is on the basis that it would form part of the UEB? television systemshared with BBC 2.     The University of the Mr would carry part of thiscost, depending largely on its share of broadcasting facilities.     capital costs would be spread over ten years.The total annual costs of the University of the Air, including ashare of the operating costs of the fourth network, running costs of itsstudios, programmes - both on television, and on radio, if local radio stations are established - and supporting services, such as correspondencecourses and viewing centres, might build up to  7 million within a few years,UniyersatyjgfV the^ Air. Gpyerning Bo djy7.     while discussions are in progress about arrangements for running thefourth network, steps will be taken to secure the establishment of theUniversity of the Air by charter, and, in consultation with educationalinterests, to set up a Governing Body, which will have control of, and responsibility for, the University.ffpnclusipn8,    With the establishment of the additional television network, therewill be four networks providing programmes of general entertainment.     TheGovernment consider it essential that a substantial share of one should be allocated to the University of the Air,     This will make a vitalcontribution to educational and cultural development in this country.Moreover, the University, by providing a wide range of short courses inprofessional and vocational subjects, will play an important part in the advance of technological studies.     The main aim is to improve the educational, cultural, and professional standards of the country as a whole.
ANNEX AREPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE AIRADVISORY COMMITTEEThe Advisory Committee (Annex B) was called together toadvise the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Miss Jennie Lee,on the educational functions and content of the University of theAir, as outlined in the speech made by Mr. Harold Wilson in glasgow on 8th September, 1963. A number of papers were submitted by members of the Committee. Discussion centred on the type of degree courses that should be offered; the nature of supporting services; and the framework of the.organisation required.The Committee completed its deliberations on 4th August, 1965,and broad agreement was reached as follows:(1) The University will require its own administrative centre,and this will be the focal point of activities; but it should make full use of existing agencies, such as the Extra-Mural Departments of universities, the Workers&apos; Educational Association (WEA) and localeducation authorities.(2) The University should offer primarily courses leading todegrees, but professional, technical, refresher and conversion coursesshould also be included.(3) The degree course should be of general type. Honours levelshould not be included in the initial stage. It should cover a group of subjects that could be taken at two levels, &quot; minor &quot; (ordinary)and &quot; major &quot; (special).The degree course might consist of five subjects, two at majorlevel and three at minor level, the major subjects requiring two years&apos;and the minor subjects one year&apos;s study. The minimum length ofthis degree course, on the basis that two major subjects would notbe attempted at the same time, would be four years, but it couldbe spread over five years or more. Some members of the Committeepreferred a course of four subjects, with a minimum completiontime of three years for the major subjects and two years for the minor subjects. Such a course would normally require five years tocomplete. The main consideration is that arrangements should beflexible, so that some students could qualify in a shorter time ifable to do so, and others could take longer if they found itnecessary. Moreover, courses in individual subjects need not be restricted to complete years; they could extend over two winterterms, with a summer residential course in between.It is essential that students should be given the opportunity ofobtaining intermediate qualifications which should be nationallyrecognised. Thus certificates and diplomas should be awarded to mark the successful completion of a part or stage of the course,and &quot; credits&quot; should be awarded for component elements of acourse which would cumulatively lead to a recognised qualification.6558A
(4) Degrees should be conferred by the University of the air in its own right, but in the early stages it may be necessary to operate under the aegis of an existing university or a consortiumof universities. The degree should carry a specific designation inthe same way as BA (Lond.) or BSc (Leeds), indicating the location of the national centre.(5) Courses in arts and social sciences present less difficultythan those in pure and applied science, since the latter groupinvolve a considerable amount of practical and laboratory work,and moreover demand a well-defined previous standard of knowledge and attainment on the part of the student. It is, however,important that the University of the Air should make a contribution to scientific and technological education. The subjectsoffered by the University for the degree course should from the outset include mathematics and the foundations of science; and itshould seek, with the co-operation of local education authorities, toextend the range for students with the necessary experience andqualifications to some technological subjects, the practical andlaboratory work being carried out in technical colleges onSaturdays and in vacation periods. Shorter courses in engineering,professional, and technological subjects should be provided fromthe start, and a Working Party should be set up to look into thepossibility of establishing courses leading to degrees and otherqualifications with a technological element.(6) The degree courses would include subjects of contemporarysocial, industrial and commercial importance; basic subjects likeEnglish, mathematics and foundations of sciences; and a range ofcultural subjects.It is recognised that it will probably not be practicable to offer a total of more than ten main subjects, and some of the subjectsmight be grouped together as units of one main subject.(7) The presentation of courses will variously involve a combination of television, radio (if local stations are establishedthese would be particularly helpful), correspondence courses,programmed instruction, tutorials and practicals, short residentialcourses, and study and discussions at community viewing or studycentres. The main contribution of television will be to bringlecturers of distinction within easy reach of everyone, to build upthe corporate feeling of a University, and to illuminate the crucialstages of a course. It will provide an added dimension, and givethe University of the Air its unique impact and coverage.The project requires peak viewing time on a television service with national coverage. On the basis that 10 subjects would require a minimum of 20 half-hour programmes each week for a 40 weekyear, the television time required would be at least two hours atpeak viewing time on five evenings a week, with repeats during theday, early morning, late evening, and at week-ends. programmes should be recorded for repeats on local closed-circuit television andby other means. Additional time, some of which would also be peakviewing time, would be necessary for the shorter courses mentionedin paragraph (5).
(8) Enrolment as a student of the University should be open to everyone on payment of a registration fee, irrespective of educationalqualifications, and no formal entrance requirement should be imposed. It would be necessary to provide an advisory or information service for intending students, which would help themto select suitable courses, for some of which a minimum startinglevel of qualifications would be advisable.(9) An estimate of the potential audience can only beguess-work, and it can be assumed that a relatively small proportionof students would complete a full degree course. But the viewingaudience would be considerable, and completion of only part of acourse and the gaining of an intermediate qualification could be ofgreat benefit to the individual and to the community. If the present rate of technological and cultural advance is to be sustained, it will depend not only on those who have reached the highest educationallevel, but on a population that is generally literate and well-informed.(10) The University should arrange for regular surveys to assess the effectiveness of courses, and the size and type of audiencesfollowing them.(11) The University will require a substantial administrativecentre, with a staff of about 40-50 of professional calibre.(12) The following organisational framework is suggested:(a) The University of the Air should have its own Vice-Chancellor, and a Governing Body or Council, meetingtwo or three times a year. The Governing Body would bedrawn largely from universities and other establishments of higher education, local education authorities, extra-mural and adult education organisations, and would include representatives of the broadcasting organisations.(b) The policy-making bodies would be an Academic Boardand an Examining Board. In addition, it might be advisable to have an Academic Assembly, where thoseworking in the field could express their views.(c) The University will require, at the senior level, a Directorof Studies who would be responsible for the co-ordinationof all the various teaching approaches&apos;that were used; aRegistrar, who would also be responsible for an advisory service to students; Heads of various departments, e.g.,Correspondence, Research and Assessment, Publications,and Operations (television, radio, films); and a group of highly qualified Heads of Faculties, who would beresponsible for the planning of courses in their ownsubjects and for the selection of lecturers and tutors. Theywill, of course, require the support of efficientadministrative machinery.(d) While the University will need a number of regional centres,and will make use of existing agencies, including localeducation   authorities,   the  WEA   and   Extra-Mural6558
Departments, it will not be enough to co-ordinate theactivities of a number of separate agencies. It is hopedthat existing educational institutions will co-operate inthe production of courses and lend staff when.needed,but the University will best achieve its aims by firmcentral control of a fully integrated operation.The central authority will require a nucleus ofproduction facilities, including studios, which will be entirely at its disposal for the production of programmes;but many of the programmes will be made elsewhere. Thecentral organisation should deal directly with outsideagencies, and retain final responsibility for the planning and presentation of programmes and courses.Tutors will be employed by the central organisationand correspondence will be centrally organised andmonitored.(e) The regional centres will be responsible for liaison withuniversities, colleges, extra-mural departments, etc., intheir areas and for making arrangements for facilities suchas libraries, laboratories, and viewing/listening posts.(13) Departmental responsibility for the University of the Air, inview of the fact that its activities would not be confined to degreework, and that other than strictly university functions andarrangements would be involved, should rest with the Department ofEducation and Science, rather than with the University GrantsCommittee.4th August, 1965.
