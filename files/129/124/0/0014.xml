DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 14 COPY NO.    jj -21st January, 1966CABINETFLOWDEN REPORT ON THE AIRCRAFT industry memorandum by the First Secretary of State and Secretary ofState for Economic affairs a Committee of Ministers under my Chairmanship has been considering the recommendations of the Plov/den Report on theAircraft Industry.2.       The main conclusions of the Report were that a substantialcontraction in the size of the aircraft industry was likely to be needed,particularly on the airframe side.     The Report said that the level of support which the industry had been receiving from the government through high prices paid for military aircraft and through unrecoveredcontributions to the development of civil aircraft had been too high andshould be reduced.     The Report recommended concentration on projects for which development costs were not disproportionate in relation to themarket;   and whole-hearted co-operation with aircraft industries in european countries on joint projects.     Finally, the Report recommendsthe purchase by the Government of a financial share in the two mainairframe companies.3.       We are agreed that the line which should be taken by theGovernment on these recommendations is as follows.(i)  We accept the basic analysis of the future of the aircraft industryin the Plowden Report.    In the light of that analysis we are convinced that there is only room for one main airframecompany in Britain.(ii)  We therefore believe that a merger of the airframe interests ofthe British Aircraft Corporation and of Hawker-Siddeleyshould be arranged and that the Government should take ashareholding in the new company,(iii)  We believe that this partnership between the Government andthe airframe industry should be arranged on a mutually agreedbasis and that the precise nature and terms of the government participation should be settled in negotiations with the existing companies.-1-
(iv)  The purpose of the merger will be to bring about are organisation of the aircraft industry to enable it to fulfil the role indicated in the Plowden Report.4.      The Minister of Aviation would propose to announce theGovernments attitude to the recommendations of the Plowden Reportalong the lines set out in this note in a Debate on the aviation industryin the House of Commons early in February.G.
