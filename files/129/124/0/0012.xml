CONFIDENTIAL &apos;       10213 DOCUMENT 13 THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJE3T Y&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)C(66) 12 COPY NO.18th January, 1966CABINETS6PUBLIC EXPENDITURE: EUROPEAN LAUNCHERDEVELOP ME NT ORGANI3AT ION  (ELDO)Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs in their report (C.(66) 11 (Annex A)) the Committee on public expenditure (P. E. ) describe this problem as one of presentation.    Thisis true: but it is also one of substance.2.       I am not happy about the decision taken in December (C. C. (65) 71stConclusions, Minute 4) to terminate the British commitment to ELDO.Events since then have increased my doubts whether that decision was theright one and a paper, prepared interdepartmentally, will shortly besubmitted inviting the Cabinet to take another look at the matter.    I am sure that it is right to do so and believe that the endorsement at thisstage of the P.E. conclusions would prejudge the outcome of thisreconsideration,3.       Even if we should decide eventually, after examining the further evidence, to go ahead as planned, I consider that the P.E. proposals arelikely to make the course of extrication more difficult and more damaging to our interests.    The publication a.t the end of February of the reducedestimate (and footnote) would leave our ELDO partners in little doubtthat we had taken  a unilateral decision to get out;  they would infer thatour approval last month of the ELDO budget for 1966 (including theBritish  12 million) was given in bad faith;  and the concurrent inclusion in the Estimates of the new money for Black Arrow would give them, theimpression that we were getting out of ELDC in the interests of our ownnational programme.    These implications would greatly complicate thetask of getting Britain out of ELDO with the minimum political damage,a tack for the conduct of -which, if we decide to uphold the earlierconclusion, I would be responsible,4.       I therefore conclude:-(i)  that examination of the P.S. conclusions should be deferred untilthe Cabinet have been able to reconsider their decision of16th December;  or, if for reasons connected with the Estimatespostponement is not possible,(ii)  that the procedure should be amended on the lines suggested tothe Committee by the Minister of  Aviation and the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs, to provide for the insertion of the fullsum of  12 million, a note being appended that this item maybe subject to adjustment in the light of the intergovernmentalmeeting in March.M. 3.Foreign Office, 3, W, 1.17th January, 1966
