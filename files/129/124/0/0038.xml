EXCHEQUER SUPPORT FOR A STATUTORY SCHEMEOF MINIMUM PRICES FOR WHITE FISHMemorandum by the Secret a. ry of State for Scotland and theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food the White Fish Authority wish to use their pov/ers underlegislation of the post-war Labour Government to promote a statutoryscheme for fixing minimum first-hand prices for white fish and have asked for an Exchequer contribution to help finance the scheme.2.      The Ministerial Committee on Economic Development haveconsidei*ed the Authority!s proposals and at their meeting on20th December last agreed that we should be ready in principle toconsider favourably the promotion of a statutory scheme.    they invited us, however, to arrange interdepartmental discussion on theinternational implications and the possibility of introducing a scheme without an Exchequer contribution.3.      As regards the international implications it is proposed to consult the Danish and Norwegian Governments, who are mainly concerned in advance of any public announcement.    If they should raiseserious objections these would be referred to Ministers and we need not anticipate them now.    The details of the scheme would also bediscussed in due course in any case with the countries concerned.    this procedure has been agreed by officials.4.      On an Exchequer contribution, no agreement has been reached and we have to put this matter to our colleagues.5.      We seek an Exchequer contribution because a scheme will not get off the ground without one and we are confident we should get goodvalue for the relatively small sura needed.    We believe we could get bywith meeting half the cost of the scheme up to a limit of  0. 5 million ayear for a period of five years.    There would undoubtedly be a partialoffset in savings on subsidy,6.     A scheme will not get off the ground without the general supportof all sections of fishermen from the larger trawler companies to thesmaller inshore fishermen,.    Without some Exchequer contribution thiswill not be forthcoming.    The reason is that different sections of theindustry will be unable to judge in advance how they will fare and willbe afraid that others will gain at their expense.    And a scheme cannotbe efficiently administered without the general support of the fishermen.We think that in the long run the fishermen will accept that the cost ofa scheme to benefit their returns should be met by them! but in the short term the benefits will be speculative and may be uneven, and an exchequer contribution is necessary,-1-CON FIDE NTS AL&quot;     29?DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 38 COPY NO.      _21st February, 1966CABINET
%ml \J fM am bJS. 1M O is*^B*2987.      The scheme will give good value in three ways.    Firstly, itwill serve as a check against the distributors who can play the marketwith a very perishable commodity when there are heavy catches.Secondly, it will be the means of introducing quality control to thebenefit   of consumers.     Thirdly, without a minimum price schemethere can be no doubt that we shall have to find over the years much more in subsidy, now on a reducing scale, than we are doing at present.8.      If we cannot promise an Exchequer contribution the industry willbe left to rely on its own unsatisfactory private minimum price arrangements.    This v/ould be unfortunate because they have manyunsatisfactory features and are not under public control.    Theprincipal private schemes are due for examination by the restrictive practices Court this summer.    If they should not survive the industry would face great instability and the fishermen might v/ell be driven to curtail their catches as a precaution against over-supply and low prices.The result would be under-supply and high prices and more imports would come in.    The big fishing companies would weather the stormbetter than small concerns and working fishermen.     But the balance ofpayments v/ould suffer and Exchequer loans of some  18 million to thefishermen on their vessels would be at risk.    And there would be great pressure for more subsidy.,-9. We pledged ourselves in the last queen s Speech to promote theeconomic development of the industry. We believe the minimum pricescheme will be taken as the test of our intentions and that an Exchequer-contribution of the order we propose is well justified.R e c omm endation10.     We recommend accordingly that subject in due course to theapproval of a statutory scheme of minimum prices the White FishAuthority should be promised an Exchequer contribution of half itscost for the first five years  subject to a limit of   0. 5 million a year.W.
