HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HSR BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)66C(66) 21 COPY NO.31st January, 1966CABINETXEC-IS-LATIChl ON THE DOCKSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerA Committee of Ministers has been considering; the content ofthe legislation for improving the efficiency of the docks v/hich wasforeshadowed in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    The Cabinet will wish to be av/areof the conclusions which we have reached.2.       The Bill will cover those matters arising from the DevlinReport on dock labour v/hich require legislation and changes in thepresent legislation on port organisation which stand in the way ofsecuring greater efficiency.Implementation of the Devlin Report3.       The Devlin Report recommended the introduction of fulldecasualisation for all dock workers.    A drastic reduction in thenumber of port employers is essential for full decasualisation, and voluntary action to reduce the number is proceeding with considerable success.    But voluntary action will not be sufficient.    It is thereforeintended to introduce by legislation a system for licensing port employers to ensure that the necessary reduction takes place and thereafter tokeep control over the number of port employers.4.       The licensing authorities will be port authorities designated bythe Minister of Transport,     This is a departure from the recommenda-ticns of the Devlin Report but there is general agreement that this willbe the best course.    It will be an essential feature of the system thatthe employers licensed to operate in a particular port must between themoffer permanent engagement to the whole of the regular labour force inthe port.     Therefore conditions will be attached to licences specifyingthe numbers to whom each employer will be required to offer permanentengagement.     There will be arrangements for transfers between employers to meet fluctuations in work.5.       Employers will have a right to appeal to the Minister against the refusal of a licence by the port authority or against the conditionsattached to the licence.    Since the port authority will usually be an employer of labour itself, employers will also be given the right to appeal against the allocation of labour by the licensing authority to itself.     The National Ports Council will also have the right to makeobjections to the Minister against a port authority&apos;s proposals.-1-
6.       The Devlin Report also recommended a radical improvement inwelfare amenities for dock workers.    Legislation is needed to ensureeffective action in this field.    Standards of amenities have already beenagreed by the Dock Labour Board and a comprehensive survey of whatneeds to be done to achieve these standards is being carried out.      Thelegislation will place a responsibility to provide the proper amenities onthe person, firm or authority which manages or controls a dock, wharfor quay.     This means that employers who own their facilities will haveto provide the amenities;  in other cases the port authorities will beresponsible.    The grant of a licence to a port employer may thereforebe made conditional on his providing specified amenities, and suitableconditions may be imposed.    If a port authority or a port employerappears to the Bock labour Board to fail to make the necessaryprovisions they will report this to the Minister of Labour;  and thelegislation will empower the Minister to issue a direction for the carrying out of the work.    If they fail to comply with the direction the dock Labour Board, will carry out the work and recover the cost.7.       These provisions will apply to all ports in the dock labour scheme,    As regards the ports - mostly very small - which are outsidethe scheme, there will be pressure for action on a voluntary basis.At a later stage, however, it may be desirable to make Regulations&apos;under the Factories Act which would apply to all ports.Froposals for ports reorganisation8.      We have agreed that further steps are needed to speed up there organisation of the ports which has been begun under the terms of the1964 Harbours Act which we welcomed in general during its passage.That Act set up a National Ports Council which is at present engagedamong other matters in the formation of new authorities covering the ports in each major estuary.    But v/e consider that additional steps are needed.    We must make faster progress in reorganisations and port groupings.    Port authorities themselves need additional powers.We need a more positive central control of investment.    We also need to try to secure more effective management of the ports,9.       To achieve these objectives we propose to include in thelegislation the following major provisions:-(i)   To give harbour authorities powers to acquire land and facilitiesowned by independent undertakings where this is necessary toimprove the efficiency of the port.    This proposal is intimatelyrelated to the proposal for the licensing of port employers.The port authorities must be able to bring about greaterconcentration and co-operation of port working and to havecompulsory powers for this purpose.(ii)   To give harbour authorities powers to carry out any activitylikely to promote port efficiency.    In particular, this willgive tliem power to operate (or participate in operating) inlandclearance depots.     These are essential if we are to reducecongestion at the ports.
(iii) To give the Minister of Transport power to direct the national ports Council to submit proposals for particular schemes of port reorganisation.    At present the initiative has to comeeither from a port authority or the National Ports Council.Although it is probable that schemes will come forward v/herethey are needed v/e cannot be wholly sure of this.    The Ministermust have powers to secure progress in particular schemes.(iv) The Minister of Transport should be given powers to settle thelines of the investment progress cf independent harbourauthorities.    At present the Minister has negative powers ofcontrol over them;  he can only refuse to permit investment.The present proposal would bring all the major independentports more or less into line with the British Transport DocksBoard so far as concerns the general control of major capital investment.In addition to these major provisions there will be a number of smallerimprovements in the present arrangements, including provision fortidying up the arrangements under which the Minister of Transport can make loans to port authorities and for the National Ports Council to joina research association and to engage in research.10.       We believe that these changes in the position of the port authorities and port employers taken together will result in a majorimprovement in the operation of the docks.    A study of the implications of even more substantial changes in the ownership and reorganisation of the docks is going forward.    But we belieye that the action set out above is necessary whatever further measures may be required at alater date.B. J.   .Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.31st January, 1966
