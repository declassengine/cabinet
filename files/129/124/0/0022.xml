JHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 221st February, 1966COPYNC.MilCABINETPUBLIC EXPENDITURE:  RGUNDING-GFF of deferment ARRANGEMENTSMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer recently put to the Committee on Public Expenditure certain proposals for the modification of the arrangements announced last Julyv/hich were designed to slow down the rate of expenditure on capital projects and on stores and equipment in the public sector.     those proposals were agreed by the Committee and, subject to the agreementof Cabinet, I propose to make an announcement in the terms of the draft annexed to this paper.    At the same time as the announcement is maderevised instructions would be sent by the Treasury to GovernmentDepartments, and in due course circulars would be sent, as necessary,to local authorities.     The 1966-67 Estimates have teen drawn up and agreed on the basis of these proposals.Capital Expenditure Projects2.       Part of the measures announced last July was the deferment for six months of all capital expenditure projects other than those incertain exempted classes.     This was a continuous rolling forward by six months until further notice of all projects affected.     The total reduction in expenditure resulting from this is probably of the order of 200 million, of which about  60 million occurs in 1966-67.    It isessential to retain the greater part of the benefit of these savings.3.       The arrangements announced in July and still in force were fromthe outset in a form in which they could be maintained only for a limited period.     They require the starting dates of all projects not exempt tobe deferred for six months.    Thus, projects due to start in September1965 have been deferred to March 1966;   those due to start in December1965 have been deferred to June 1966;   and those due to start in March1966 (apart of course from those already deferred from September 1965)will, on present form, be deferred to September 1966;   and so on,4. ,     This arrangement could be maintained only for so long as theDepartments concerned had as at last July lists of firm starting datesfor all projects.    We are now entering a period for which firm startingdates did not exist for all projects and Departments are running into some difficulty on this account in operating the arrangements.-1-
5.       It is therefore necessary to substitute for these arrangementsa method of control by expenditure limits.    Under this each department will be required to limit its capital expenditure in 1966-67 as follows.It will work out the expenditure which would have arisen in that year onthe projects deferred in the first six months of the operation of thescheme and it will deduct that sum from whatever was the previouslyplanned capital expenditure limit.     The resulting sum then becomes theupper limit for permissible expenditure in that year, and within thatlimit Departments will be able to re-programme investment as they see fit.     This principle has been applied in preparing the 1966-67Estimates, and I have agreed the method of its application with theMinisters concerned as necessary.6.       There is no need to take any decision now about 1967-68.    Itwill however be necessary for Departments to ensure that for themoment their expenditure commitment for that year is not allowed to go beyond the level v/hich would be arrived at if the procedure described in paragraph 5 were applied to 1967-68.    In this way we can keep the door open for a decision at a later stage.Local Authorities7.       The arrangement described in paragraph 5 would apply not onlyto departments  own spending but also to their control of capitalexpenditure programmes by local authorities.     For miscellaneouslocal authority projects outside the main programmes Departmentsmust continue to give loan sanction and grant only for projects whichare urgently required.8.       Expenditure on lending for house purchase should also continueto be restricted to  130 million a year from April 1966.    Some adjust-ment may however be needed in the allocation to particular authorities of this total sum and the Ministers concerned, will be consulting eachother about this.Stores and Equipment9.       Where deferment of purchases has led to a reduction in stocksDepartments should endeavour to keep them at their present level, andshould only raise them where it is really necessary.    In any caseDepartments should as far as possible continue to avoid any building upof reduced stocks before the end of 1966-67.Announc em ent10.       I attach a draft of a Statement which I would propose to make onthis subject in the House on Tuesday, 0th February.iii-j. J. C.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1. l!.31st January, 1966SECfMET
DRAFT STATEMENT BY THE CHANCELLOR OF THE exchequer on 27th July last I announced the adoption by the Government ofcertain measures.    Some of these affected public investment andexpenditur e.2.       These measures have achieved their purpose.    In particular,the rate of expenditure on capital projects has been appreciablyreduced.    I estimate that in the six months since the arrangements were announced about  200 million worth of capital projects have been deferred for six months.    I am grateful to all those who have made theresult possible.     There can be no doubt that this deferment has reduced the pressure of demand below the excessively high level whichit would otherwise have reached, and so has contributed to the improve-ment in our balance of payments.3.       The time has now come for the system of deferment to bereplaced by normal methods of control.     The Government has there-fore fixed new annual expenditure limits, and from now on GovernmentDepartments v/ill be working within these new limits, both in their ownspending and in their control of capital expenditure programmes bylocal authorities.     They will be able to re-programme their investment as may be necessary.    In fixing these limits account will be taken ofthe effects of deferment.     Estimates for 1966-67 are being prepared onthis basis,4,       Circulars v/ill be sent to local authorities, as necessary,notifying them of the new arrangements.    Loan sanction and grants for miscellaneous local a.uthority projects outside the main programmeswill continue to be given only for projects which are urgently required.
