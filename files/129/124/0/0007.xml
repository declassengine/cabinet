C(66) 7 COPY NO.     6 C17th January, 1966CABINETSUPER vc10s FOR MIDDLE EAST AIRLINES   \Memorandum by me President of the Beard of trade for the past year the British Aircraft Corporation (.B.A. C.)have been trying to conclude a deal with Piddle East Airlines for thesale of a number of Super VCiOs,     They have been in stiff competition with Boeing and more recently with Douglas.    And it has at ail timesbeen pretty clear that it would be impossible for B.A.C. to get the contract on terms which they regarded as commercially possible without government assistance.2.       hi march 1965 the Ministerial Sub-Committee cn external economic Policy agreed that this prospective sale could notbe judgedsolely on its individual commercial merits.     The xnajority of theCommittee agreed that the balance of advantage lay in making a specialoffer to sell Super vc10s to Middle East Airlines in the hope that thiswould lead to sales to other overseas airlines and generally to main-taining the competitive position of British long range aircraft in world markets.    At that time Piddle East Airlines were asking for theirexisting Comets to be bought back at a price greater than their trueresale value.    It was agreed to underwrite to a substantial extent there-purchase of these aircraft by B. A. C. ;   and it was expected that theloss falling on the Government would be of the order of  ^ million inconsequence.3.       Since March 1965 negotiations have continued.    In the course ofthem Middle East Airlines decided that they wanted to retain the Cometsso that the offer to re-purchase them at a favourable price becameirrelevant.     The number of Super vc10s required was reduced fromfive to three with an option on a further four.    B. A. C. reduced theprice for the aircraft to one which covered only the bare expenses of producing aircraft to the Middle East Airlines1 order.4.       Recently the Chairman of Puddle East Airlines has indicatedterms on which he might be prepared to buy the Super vc10s.     Theseare as follows:(i)   The price for the aircraft to be  2. 67 m. - the lowest prices.A. C. will go to.(ii)  B.A. C. to make an interest free loan for ten years of 360,000 per aircraft.(iii)  Payment for the aircraft to be 2-^ per cent on signature of con-tract, 2&quot;! per cent per cent on delivery and the balance of95 per cent spread over ten years (the usual credit terms).i DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)
conf2:-:h48(iv)  Arrangements for the sale of Lebanese apples to be made in theUnited Kingdom of at least 20 per cent of the value of the air-craft.5.       3. A. C. have now said that they are only prepared to sign a contract on these terms if the Government will give them the followingassistance:(i)   To make available the  1 m. necessary to finance the interestfree loa.n for ten years to Middle East Airlines.(ii)   To make a further loan of  240, 000 interest free for ten years to cover the probable deficit on the sale of the aircraft at aprice of  2.67 rn.(iii)   To provide working capital of about  7-3- m. to B.A. C. over theperiod of production to be repaid on delivery of the aircraft.6.       As regards the sale of Lebanese apples in this country theposition is as follows.    Apples generally are on a global import quota.We have made it clear that we could not agree to establishing a specialquota for Lebanese apples.    However, B.A.C. have found an importerwho, for a suitable commission, will use part of the global quota to import Lebanese apples.     The amount is not much but it will slightlyreduce the imports we have been obtaining from traditional suppliers.And it will be well-known that this is part of a deal which has been made possible only by Government assistance.    We may well have protests from traditional suppliers and attempts to raise the global quota.    Weshould try to avoid doing this, because it would create difficulties withour home apple growers, but we might in the end be forced to.7.       There may also be some difficulty over securing Export credits guarantee Department (E. C.G. D.) credit for the full sum involved inthe deal since E. C.G. B. do not regard Middle East Airlines as credit-worthy for the full sum.    We hope, however, that this difficulty can be overcome without overriding the commercial judgment of E, C.G.D.Arguments in favour of ravin;,.; Government assista.ncc8,       The Minister of Aviation holds the view strongly that in thespecial circumstances cf this deal we ought to help B. A. C. in the way they ask.    I myself on balance share this view;   and so do the Ministerof State, Foreign Office, and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary,Commonwealth Relations Office.    Our reasons are as follows:(i)     If B.A.C. secured this order for Super vc10s, it would incx-ease the chances of selling a few more of these aircraft to  other overseas airlines which have not yet completed their purchases of longrange jets.     There Ere still some prospects of selling the aircraft insuch countries as Nigeria, Malaysia, Thailand, Austria and evenCzechoslovakia.    If, on the other hand, we lose the Middle EastAirlines contract, it seems very likely that v/e shall have to abandonany hope of selling the Super VC10 in world markets.     This wouldprobably end the prospect of exporting British long range supersonicjet aircraft.-2-
(ii) Moreover, v/e have already made offers to Middle EastAirlines which would have involved a Government subsidy for the dealof probably  f m. ana perhaps more.     The cost of the interest free loannow proposed to B. A, C. will be about  jj m, on a discounted cash flowbasis.    We think it would be a mistake in effect to withdraw the offer,albeit in a different form.(iii) To give an interest free loan to Middle East Airlines cannot beregarded as unfair competition since the Douglas Company has already offered an even larger interest free loan if they get the contract.    It isno more than &quot;matching&quot; in principle;   and assistance of this kind to aircraft sales is not regarded internationally as an outright exportsubsidy.(iv) The direct loss of this contract may in the end be somewhatoffset by profits on the sale of spares to I/addle East Airlines over thenext ten years.Arguments against givinft Government assistance9.       The Chief Secretary,  Treasury, and the Minister of State,Department of Economic Affairs, are, however, strongly opposed to giving B.A. C. the assistance they demand.     The Minister of agriculture is also disturbed about the probable repercussions of that part of thedeal v/hich involves Lebanese apples.     The arguments advanced againstsubsidising the deal are as follows:(i)  &quot;Whether or not we get this contract with Middle East Airlinesthe chances of selling many Super vc10s elsewhere on a commerciallyprofitable basis arc very small.    All the major airlines are now com-mitted to American jet aircraft of this generation.     The few remainingairlines who have not yet re-equipped will almost certainly not beprepared to buy VCIOs save on a subsidised basis.(ii) It is wrong for Britain to continue using scarce resources in theengineering field to produce aircraft which can only be sold abroad,at a loss, as will probably be the case with YClOs.(iii) Since the original decision was taken in March 1965 tc try tosecure this contract on uncommercial terms, it has become quite clearthat the VC10 will not be a success in world markets;   the PlowdenReport had recommended that the British Aircraft industry should not seek, at any rate on its own, to stay in the market for ls.rge jet aircraft.10.        If it is decided that we should go ahead, the Minister of Aviationwould propose to increase the launching aid to 3.A.C. for the VCIOs by 1, 320, 000.    So far the Government have provided just over  10 m.cut of a total development cost of  36 m. , so that the total assistance would still be far below the 50 per cent &quot;norm&quot; for launching aid.     TheMinister proposes that the working capital could be made availableeither under the launching aid procedure or through provision of a bankguarantee.11. The Treasury state, however, that it would not be correct to describe as &quot;launching aid&quot; in the Estimate what is essentially a loan tothe B.A, C.    A Supplementary Estimate would have to be taken thisyear in which the nature and purpose of the loan would have to be made clear.    Similarly, specific Estimate provision would be needed to cover the making available of working capital either in the form of a loan orin the form of a bank guarantee.
Conclusion12.        The decision whether or not to give a Government subsidy tcB.A. C. in connection with this contract turns, therefore, basically oncne&apos;s judgment as to whether the securing of this contract is likely tomake very much difference to the chance cf selling additional VCIOs orother British aircraft in world markets.    Some of us believe that it migltip the scales sufficiently to produce additional orders which would makethe relatively small subsidy worth while.     Others of us do not believe itwould.D.P. T.
