IS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JESTY?S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 26 COPY NO.3rd February, 1966CABINETSITING OF PROTOTYPS FAST REACTORMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland the Minister of Technology has set out in C(66) 24 certain ofthe considerations, especially the financial calculations, that shouldbe taken into account in deciding whether to build the Prototype FastReactor (PFR) at Dounreay or at Winfrith.     The present papercomments on some of the Minister*s arguments, and deals with thesocial considerations which ax-e the main element in the case forDounreay.2.      Paragraph 11 of the Minister..&apos;s paper brings out a figure of 1. 3 million at 197 0 values, as the additional cost of siting at Dounreay.This is offset by the  1. 5 million that would be saved, as explained inhis paragraph 9, by avoiding the inefficiency inherent in alternative methods of providing power for the North of Scotland.    What bringshis cost balance down against Dounreay is the assessment in hisparagraphs 12-13 that the loss of efficiency due to splitting reactordevelopment activities between Dounreay and Winfrith would cost  if million a year for a period of 10 years, or  8 million at 1970values.    The paragraphs however make clear the speculative natureof at least half the cost assumed for loss of efficiency? and this element of uncertainty must detract from the force of the argument.3.     In attempting a comprehensive balance sheet of cost, moreover,account has to be taken of expenditure incurred in seeking to promotealternative forms of employment for the families concerned, almost all of whom live in the near-by town of Thurso which has increased in population from 3, 300 in 1954 to 9, 200 now.    Paragraph 6 of theMinister*s paper indicates that, in order to maintain employment inthe area at its present level, some 1,100 jobs would in any event haveto be provided by 1976, even if the PFR goes to Dounreayj and anadditional 1,200 if it does not, in which event all 2, 300 would be needed by 1974.4,      With every effort by the Highlands and Islands development board, there will be very great difficulty in providing the 1,1G0 jobsneeded by 1976 at locations that .can be served by the present houses and schools in Thurso, and there will be a serious rick of starvingother parts of the Highlands of essential development.    Substantialprovision by an earlier date, with a further 1, 200 jobs by 1974, is improbable in the extreme, unless come other large scale Governmentestablishment is located in the area; and I do not myself know of anyestablishment, existing or prospective, that might serve this purpose.-1-
5.      Even small projects in the Highlands will cost the Exchequersome  1,5 00 per job, so that a theoretical figure for outlays to make good the loss of the extra 1,200 jobs would be little short of  2 million a substantial offset to the firm element in the  8 million mentionedin paragraph 2 above.    But this is an unreal figure;   the only project of the necessary scale recently located in the Highlands is the FortWilliam Pulp Mill, which cost the Exchequer a   10 million loan (withrelief of interest up to  1. 3 million) for 1, 200 jobs in the Mill itself.6.      The loss of the extra 1,200 jobs would directly affect something like one-third of the whole population of Thurso, and I cannot accept that it would be a solution to let the local population run down to that extent.     There would be the gravest social and political objectionsto this course, acquiescence in v/hich would fly in the face of all weas a Government have said and done about the Highlands.    Moreover, 7. 5 million of public money has been Dpent since 1954 in providing modern hom.es, schools and other services for the presentpopulation;  it would be a clear waste of money to have to reprovidethese elsewhere.    I am not aware that considerations of this kindapply with anything like comparable force at Winfrith, which, unlikeBounreay, is not in a development area.7.      I do not see why the role of the PFR as a showpiece for foreignbuyers need be seriously affected by locating it at Dounreay;  theycould certainly be flown there in two or three hours from London.Nor should such a location imply doubts about the safety of the PFR,it would surely seem entirely rational that it should have been builtalongside the experimental reactor on v/hich it is based; and whenthe question of seeking foreign sales a.rices, v/e shall no doubt havefirm proposals to build commercial Fast Reactors in more populousareas elsewhere in Britain.8.      In the light of the considerations set out in this memorandum,I ask my colleagues to decide that the PFR should be built at Dounreay.W. R.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.3rd -February, 1966-2-
