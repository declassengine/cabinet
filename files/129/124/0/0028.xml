SECRET *         07DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC majesty&apos;S GOVERNMENT)C(66) 28 COPY NO.,4 th February. 1966CABINETFARM PRICE review memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster i have to report a breakdown in attempts to reach agreement inthe Ministerial Committee on Farm Price Review on the extent of the discretion to be given to Agricultural Ministers in negotiations on thisyear&apos;s farm price review.Lastyear&apos;s review2.       Last year, it will be remembered, the review gave the farmersabout  10 million.    As their costs were expected to increase by about 30 million and their efficiency by  25 million, this required them tomeet about two-thirds of increased costs out of increased efficiency.The review had to be imposed, and the Cabinet will remember not onlythe row but the firmness and success with v/hich the Minister ofAgriculture handled it.    Because the weather v/as bad last summer,total farm incomes fell by  12 million in 1965-66;  had the weather been&quot;normal&quot;, they v/ould have risen by about  12 million.    Milk, however,turned out rather better than the farmers feared:  though the total size of the dairy herd had not significantly changed, yields were high, as there was plenty of grass.The policy objective3.       Farmers&apos; costs and their efficiency are both expected to increase by about  30 million this year.     This year&apos;s review is the first sincethe publication of the National Plan.     Clearly the review must be seen to be consistent with, indeed to further, the objectives for agriculturelaid down in the Plan.     There is no disagreement on this, or on the corollary of it:  that at this review the main emphasis should be onencouraging beef &quot;production.     The main area, of disagreement is onthe amount of additional support that is needed and justifiable this yearto achieve that objective, and on the amount of room for manoeuvrethat Agricultural Ministers should be given for negotiations with the farmer s,4.  .    An expansion of beef production entails an increase in the dairy herd, whose calves provide over two-thirds of our home-grown beef.So in order to encourage beef production v/e have not only to give directsupport in guaranteed prices and subsidies for beef:  we have also togive indirect support by encouraging milk production.    Incentives tobeef production therefore need to be distributed in a combination ofthree ways:&quot;I- *       i
(I)     an increase in the guaranteed price of fat cattle (every extra1/- costs the Exchequer  1. 2 million);(2)    the introduction of a subsidy on beef cows (the agricultural ministers&apos; proposal for a subsidy of  7 to  8 per head would cost the Exchequer  3 million);(3)    an increase in the standard quantities and/or guaranteed priceof milk (each jd. a gallon on the guaranteed price of rnilkbrings in  4.4 million and costs the consumer jd.. a pint for two months).The main area of disagreement5.       The area of disagreement can be set out in a table:Increase inOveralllimit onnegotiationsAgriculturalMinistersBoard of trade department ofEconomic AffairsTreasury m.3023/2!2011guaranteedprice off at cattleShillings      m,10 12.08/10     9.6/12.0Beef-cowsubsidy m.33Guaranteedprice ofmilkPence  m,per gall.89.610if13.48.88. 8* The figures in this column are different from the sum of the figures inthe other columns, because these figures include other proposals for changes in guarantees and grants besides those on beef and milk.6.    The Treasury think that the overall objectives, and the objectives for beef production, can be achieved with an increase of  11 million.They do not object to the proposed beef-cow subsidy, provided that the combined cost of the subsidy and the increase in the guaranteed price off at cattle does not exceed  10 million:  in other words, they v/ould let theAgricultural Ministers have their beef-cow subsidy if the increase in the guaranteed price of fat cattle did not exceed 6/- (costing  7. 2 million).If, however, the Agricultural Ministers v/ould agree to limit the increasein the guaranteed price of milk to Id. a gallon, the Treasury v/ould beprepared to go up to 8/- on the guaranteed price of fat cattle (raisingtheir overall limit from  11 million to  134 million).7.       The Department of Economic Affairs are particularly anxious tokeep to a minimum the increase in the retail price of milk.    fd. a pinton the retail price is an increase of 5 per cent (though how much smallercould an increase be?).    Id. a gallon on the guaranteed price meansintroducing the extra f-d. in December 1966;  1-g-d. a gallon on the guaranteed price means introducing the extra ^d. in October 1966.They consider that Id, a gallon is as far as we should go.     Their over-all figure of  20 million woul increase farmers1 incomes (which have
to cover the costs of increased investment as well as personal incomes)by about 5 per cent;  they consider that more than that would be toogenerous in terms of prices and incomes policy.8.       The Commonwealth Relations Office fear that demand for liquid milk and manufactured milk products is not sufficiently elastic(particularly if the price is increased) to absorb the whole of any increasein domestic milk production that may result from an increase in the guaranteed price of milk.     They fear that too great an increase mayadversely affect the market for imported butter and thus prejudice ourrelations with countries with v/hom we have agreements on butterimports.     They point out that wc have just increased the Irish quota forbutter imports.     They would therefore prefer the increase in the guaranteed price of milk not to exceed Id. per gallon.9.       The Agricultural Ministers believe that, if they started (let alone finished) with an offer of  11 million (as suggested by the Treasury),it would be regarded as derisory, and negotiations would break down.They would like complete discretion, without formal limit, to do thebest they can within the general lines of their own proposals.     They donot think that they could start on a figure of less than Id. a gallon on the guaranteed price of milk, and would be reluctant to be given no leewayto move up to Fj-d. ;  they would however be prepared to accept the limit of Id. a gallon on milk if they could have another million or two poundsroom for manoeuvre on the cattle price and beef subsidy.    They believethat increased consumption of liquid milk and manufactured milk productswould take up the increase in domistic milk production withoutsignificantly cutting into the market for imported milk products (particu-larly butter).Other points of disagreement10.       There are other points on which no agreement has been reached.For instance, the Treasury, arguing on the basis of substantial increase of acreages and yields in 1965, want to see the profitability ofwheat and barley reduced by cuts in guaranteed prices.     TheAgricultural Ministers point out that the 1965 crops were plantedbefore the 1965 review, the effect of which is not reflected in thefigures on which the Treasury rely:  latest retxirns show a fall of about half a million acres in this year&apos;s plantings of winter wheat.    But wecan probably settle this and other points in the Farm Price review committee, if we have rulings on the overall limit on negotiations andon the levels of support for beef and milk.Conclusions and suggestions11.       Discussions in the Farm Price Review Committee have narrowedthe area of disagreement from a range between  11 million and  30million overall to a range between about  13-1 million and about  27jrmillion (the comparable figures for beef and milk are  18. 8 million to 28.4 million, reduced to  21.4 million to  26 million),12.       My own conclusions are:(l)     We should set an overall limit to the total cost we are preparedto accept, but leave the Agricultural Ministers as niuch room for manoeuvre as possible within that.
(2)    In the light cf the la.st review and the drop in farm incomes lastyear, a limit of  11 million, which would again require the farmers tomeet two-thirds o  the increase in costs out of the proceeds of greater efficiency, would be too tough.    It would be a bad start for the Plan,where the key word is expansion.(3)    On the other hand, if we are too generous this year we shall haveless to offer in later years.     The industry might well prefer a seriesof moderately acceptable reviews, giving confidence in steady expansionto one fat year followed by several lean years,(4)    What we do this year will be judged by comparison with what we did last year.    So the starting point is low, and even a fairly toughsettlement will seem to be a relative improvement.(5)    We should not increase the guaranteed price of milk by morethan Id. a gallon this year.13.       My own suggestions, which I put forward for myself alone, not as Chairman of the Farm Price Review Committee, are therefore asfollows:(1)     We should endorse the general policy objectives for this review(see paragraph 3).(2)    On milk, we should ask Agricultural Ministers not to offer morethan the equivalent of Id. a gallon in the guaranteed price.    (the emphasis should be on beef:   extra, milk is, so to speak, a by-product,which we do not need for itself:  it is a ?matter of getting the balance rigr(3)    We should fix a final overall limit of, say,   20 million (I give this figure as a basis for discussion) for mis year&apos;s review.      20million would give an average increase of 5 per cent in farmers1 income(4)    We should invite the Agricultural Ministers on this basis tosuggest to the Farm. Price Review Committee what the opening offer should be, in total and in detail, and what distribution they would aimfor in a final offer of  20 million (or whatever other figure we fix under(3)).(5)     The Agricultural Ministers should not however be bound bytheir detailed proposals to the Farm Price Review Committee;  ifwithin an overall figure they saw advantage in offering more in one place and less in another, they should be free to do so.14.       There will be no hope of an agreed review on this basis.    ThePresident of the National Farmers&apos; Union has &quot;done an Adenauer&quot;, andrevoked his intention to retire.    He was ill during last year&apos;o review and this time will be determined to show that he is the real heavyweightchampion.    We must therefore put the Agricultural Ministers in astrong position.D.H.70, Whitehall, S.W.1.4tli February, 1966
