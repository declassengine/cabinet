confidential CABINET OFFICE^  1 -- RECORD copy .(52) 167 copy no. .X ^19th may, 1952cabinetROYAL VISIT TO AUSTRALIA AND NEW ZEALAND:CHOICE OF SHIPNote by the Secretary of the CabinetThe Prime Minister has directed that the annexed minute bythe First Lord of the Admiralty and the Minister of Transport should beconsidered by the Cabinet on Tuesday, 20th May.(Signed)  NORMAN BROOK%Cabinet Office, S. W. 1.,19TH MAY, 1952.PRIME MINISTER FROM FIRST LORD OF THE ADMIRALTY and minister OF TRANSPORTMinute of 13th May, 1952  &apos;The earliest date for completion of the new Royal Yacht is the endof 1953.   She should be able to sail about 19th January, 1954, reaching australia or New Zealand in the first week of March.   There is no margin in these dates,and any labour troubles would retard date of completion.On political grounds, Australia and New Zealand desire the visit to be made not later than 1954.   There have been consultations between the twoPrime Ministers and Mr. Menzies intends to discuss the matter when he reachesEngland at the end of May.   Present indications are that the two PrimeMinisters hope that &quot;it will be possible for the visit to be completed by april 1954&quot;.   This would necessitate Her Majesty arriving in Australia or new Zealand in mid-January, 1954,It will be essential that a ship should be available to Her Majestyduring the tour.   The possible courses are:-   I(1) to adjust the dates of the tour to enable the Royal Yacht to be used;(2) to use s, s. GOTHIC, the vessel being released in the meantime for trade purposes (some modifications in accommodation beingmade temporarily for that purpose);
(3)  to use a cruiser of the Australian or New Zealand navies;(4) to charter a suitable liner (for use unconverted) when the time comes.Course (1) would require that Her Majesty should leave UnitedKingdom by air about mid-February, being joined by the Royal Yacht earlyin March.   To Her Majesty and the United Kingdom Government this would bethe best arrangement, but it involves either a very short visit or the tourextending probably into May.Course (2) involves retaining a hold on GOTHIC at a cost of about 125,000,   The advantage would be that the ship would be eminently suitedfor the purpose.   As Her Majesty is not willing to leave United Kingdom beforeJanuary, 1954, it would still be necessary for her to travel to New Zealand by air or to postpone her arrival until late February, 1954.Course (3) is not recommended by the Admiralty, even thoughHer Majesty and the Duke of Edinburgh would be content, for the short periodsduring which the ship would be required, with a much lower standard of accommodation than the Royal Yacht or the GOTHIC would provide.Course (4) should be possible, provided reasonable notice couldbe given.We understand from the Palace that Her Majesty, owing to thecost, is not in favour of retaining a hold on the GOTHIC, and that she would be willing to make use of a liner (Course (4)), unconverted or with only quiteminor modifications - if Course (1) proves unacceptable to the australian and New Zealand Governments.  Accordingly, we consider that the GOTHICshould now be returned to her owners.An immediate decision on this point is essential, the ship beingdue to reach this country within the next few days.  Already there areliabilities for compensation because the delay in decision has prevented boththe owners and the shipyard, in which it is intended to undertake reconversion,from making firm plans for future use or reconversion:  we hope that theseliabilities might be disposed of at little or even no cost if a firm decision is available within a day or two,A copy of this minute is being sent to the Chancellor of theExchequer and to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.
