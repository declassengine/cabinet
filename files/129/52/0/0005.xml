1  wCONFIDENTIALC.(52) 15513TH..MAY, 1952CABINET office record copy copy NO.CABINETCOUNCIL OF EUROPEASSEMBLY RESOLUTION NO. 21:  PROPOSAL FORA EUROPE-COMMONWEALTH conference memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europelater this month, I may be called upon to state Her Majesty&apos;s governments view on a proposal of the Consultative Assembly (copy in Annex A) for theconvocation of a Europe-Commonwealth Conference to discuss the possibilityof a closer economic association between Western Europe and the Sterling Area.I accordingly invite my colleagues to consider the points raised by thisproposal and to endorse the conclusions in paragraphs 6 and 7 below.2. Recommendation No. 21, on &quot;the Aims and Prospects of a EuropeanPolicy&quot;, was passed by the Consultative Assembly in December, 1951.   it contains a jumble of proposals on a number of subjects mainly connected withthe future organisation and functions of the Council of Europe.   As a resultof our own suggestions (Cmd. 8516) for the remodelling of the Council,consideration of this recommendation as a whole was deferred when it came before the Committee of Ministers at their last meeting in March.   Therecommendation may, however, be raised at the next meeting of the Committee,which begins at Deputy level on 16th May.   The Ministers themselves meet on22nd May.3.        Part C at the end of the recommendation revives an earlier proposal fora Europe-Commonwealth Conference and suggests that such a conference &quot;shouldamong other things examine the possibility of setting up an association betweenfree Europe and the Sterling Area&quot;.   It is possible that this proposal may escapefurther notice if the recommendation as a whole is shelved.   Discussion may,however, be unavoidable.4, There has for some time been strong support in the Consultative Assemblyfor the idea of closer economic association between Western Europe and the sterling Area.   The nature and composition of such an association has never been precisely defined, different exponents emphasising different aspects.   Itis evident from the annexed memorandum (Annex B), which has been preparedby the Departments principally concerned, that the consequences for the UnitedKingdom of such an association might be very far-reaching.   So far ascommercial policy is concerned, it would clearly be impossible for us to reach anyconclusion until the review for which we have called (E, A. (5Z) 9th Meeting)has been carried out.   In other respects, the proposed association may well befound to contain the seeds of the disruption of the Commonwealth and the sterling Area, which are the foundations of our position as a great Power, andto imperil the consolidation of the Atlantic Community to which our efforts areat present directed.   Indeed, from the wider political and strategic as well asperhaps from the economic standpoint, the proposed grouping is either too wide ortoo narrow, and to contemplate such a grouping without North America would notin present conditions be very sensible.
5. But, however  strong our reservations as to the results for the UnitedKingdom of an association of the type proposed, there might be difficulty in opposing, in principle and out of hand, the convocation of a Europe-commonwealth conference, even though the objects and indeed composition of such aconference are so vague.   My colleagues on the Committee of Ministers mightpoint out with some truth that the other members of the Commonwealth mightnot necessarily share our views;  and 1 should not wish to impose a veto upondiscussion of the project which, whatever its demerits from our point of view,is regarded in some quarters as promising a solution to the economic problems of Western Europe.   I believe that our best line would be that theproposals are too indefinite for any action at present but that we will consultour Commonwealth partners if more specific ideas are put forward by theAssembly.conclusions. I propose accordingly that I should be authorised to speak on thefollowing lines:-(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Government are doubtful whether an association of the type proposed is compatible with their policy of promoting closer relationsbetween the United Kingdom, Europe and North America in the North atlantic treaty Organisation, and fully reserve their position on the proposal,,(b) They would be prepared to consider, in consultation with the other commonwealth countries, any mutually advantageous proposals for closer association between the Commonwealth and Europe:  but, such consideration and consultation can only take place on the basis of specific proposals, which areat present lackingu(c) The Committee of Ministers should accordingly refer Recommendation 21back to the Consultative Assembly with the request for a more explicit statementof the type of association that the Assembly has in mind.(d) Her Majesty&apos;s Government will be prepared, in the light of the Assembly&apos;reply, to consult with the other Commonwealth Governments.7. I propose, if my colleagues agree, that the other commonwealth governments, and the United States Government, should be informed of theabove conclusions before the meeting of the Committee of Ministers takesplace0A.E.Foreign Office, S.W. 1. ,13TH MAY, 1952.2-
ANNEX AEE COMMEND AT I ON 21 - PART CISConsidering that it is necessary to give fresh impetus to theeconomic, financial and social unification of Europe as a whole, inclose co-operation with the Commonwealth countries,The Assembly recalls its Recommendation of 5th September, 19k9,for the convening of a Europe-Commonwealth Conference, and is of theopinion that such a Conference might among other things examine thepossibility of setting up an association between free Europe and the sterling Area.ANNEX BCONSEQUENCES FOR THE UNITED KINGDOM OF an association BETWEEN FREE EUROPE AND the sterling AREA.1.    The Recommendation makes no attempt to define the nature of theassociation between free Europe and the Sterling Area but it is nodoubt inspired by ideas which have recently been advanced, notably byMr. Boothby, for a single economic unit embracing Western Europe andthe Sterling Commonwealth which, it is claimed, could stand on its ownfeet and be independent of American Aid.    The form and constitutionof the unit is left indeterminate except that it would include anextension of Imperial preference to cover Western Europe and wouldprobably involve a unified control over the economy of the area as awhole;    the abandonment of convertibility of sterling, even as a long-term aim, and a permanent system of discrimination against the dollar area.2.     Proposals of this kind involve difficult issues some of whichwill need to be studied in the context of the enquiry into future .external commercial policy recently decided upon by Ministers(E.A.(52) 9th Meeting).    The following paragraphs set out brieflysome of the more important considerations which arise in the light of present United Kingdom policies.3.      Effect on United Kingdom&apos;s interests(i) The position of the United Kingdom as a great power verylargely depends on its economic and political ties with theCommonwealth.    Any closer formal association between theCommonwealth and Western Europe would weaken the special relationship between the United Kingdom and theCommonwealth countries.(ii) Any move to bring the United Kingdom and Europe closer to-gether in a new association which does not include the UnitecStates and which involved the concept of a Third force would at present be unacceptable to the Commonwealth, par-ticularly to Canada, and would be contrary to presentUnited Kingdom policy which is to lay stress on the concept of an Atlantic community, including the UnitedStates and Canada as equal partners.
0(iii)A unified control over the economies of the sterling area and Western European countries could hardly be estab-lished without an agreement between all the countries concerned on the detailed objectives of economic policyand it is doubtful whether this could be achieved withouta degree of political federation.(iv) The United Kingdom and the rest of the Commonwealth are committed to the objective of sterling convertibility.Abandonment of this objective would be contrary to thedeclaration made after the Conference of commonwealth finance Ministers in London last January.(v) In so far as both Western Europe and the sterling commonwealth are at present in dollar deficit, the amalgamation of the two blocs of dollar debtors would notin itself create a more viable unit.    Western Europemight hope to gain more dollars than it can now earn;    butthis would probably be at the expense of the sterling area.(vi)Any development whereby Sterling Area countries becameindividual members of a larger payments organisation on thelines of the European Payments Union would be directlycontrary to the objective of expanding the internationaluse of sterling and would lead to the disappearance ofmany of the clearing and banking services now provided byLondon.(vii) A European-Sterling Area bloc would be likely to reduce thevalue of the preferential treatment we enjoy in other sterling Area countries.    The Sterling Area countries mightbe ready to grant -preferences to the European countries inreturn for freer access to the markets of Continental Europe;but a bargain of this kind would be at our expense.    It isdoubtful whether we could obtain any compensating advantages. .h*    Position of Colonial TerritoriesUntil it is known precisely what form the &quot;association&quot; wouldtake,  the effect on, and the attitude of,  the dependent overseas territories (which stand in a sijecial relationship to the UnitedKingdom) cannot be determined.    The. effect of any concrete proposal would have to be carefully considered in the light of the differingpolitical and economic conditions, and treaty obligations, applicableto the various territories.    The dependent territories cannot betreated entirely as a homogeneous unit in this respect, but ingeneral it is unlikely that they,  or the United Kingdom, would stand to gain from any arrangement which weakens their ties withthe United Kingdom,  as the proposed &quot;association&quot; well might.5.      Position of CanadaCanada not being a sterling country would necessarily be excluded from the type of economic unit which appears to be envisaged and the consequences for Anglo-Canadian relations might be disastrous.    Moreover, the country that would be excluded is the oneCommonwealth country apart from ourselves which has the closestinterest in European unity and the closest links with Europe (through its membership of N.A.T.O.).    Even if it were found possible to d evisa means of securing Canadian participation in such an association,it is quite out of the question that Canada would accept it unlessAmerica also were a participant.    Canada is in any case strongly opposed to new preferential blocs.
6.      Attitude of the U.S.A.The Americans may find themselves pulled in opposite directions.They have been strongly opposed to any extension of preferentialsystems and to moves which appeared likely to make permanent or moredurable discriminatory measures against their exports.   On the otherhand their policy is to welcome arrangements which integrate and strengthen Europe.    On the whole there is little doubt that the U.S.A.would object to arrangements which conflicted with the ideals ofmultilateral trade and convertibility of currencies.
