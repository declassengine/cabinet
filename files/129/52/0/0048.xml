cabinet office record COPY(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)confidential. (52) 198 COPY NO.^JUNE 17, 1952CABINETOPENCAST COAL MINING:   EAST LOTHIANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for scotland i must oppose the proposal made by the Secretary of Statefor Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power and the Minister of Fuel and Power(C. (52) 194) that sites in East Lothian comprising 275 acres of first-class arable land should be requisitioned for opencast coal working.2. The extent of first-class land in Scotland is a very small proportion of the total area; and of this much of East Lothian probably takespride of place.3. This is the first proposal to requisition land in East Lothian.Authority has, however, been given to prospect no less than twelve sites (about ,000 acres) in that county, some of them superior in quality to those at present under consideration.   If the present proposal is approved, it may well be the first of many others.4. On a simple comparison between the immediate value of thecoal and the money loss in agricultural production the conclusion must obviouslygo in favour of coal.   This would be so however high the productivity of the landinvolved.   But I suggest that this should not be the test.   Opencast mining is atemporary expedient, whereas our first-class land is a permanent asset to thecountry.   Once destroyed by opencast mining it can doubtless be restored after afashion to agricultural production.   At the best estimate available at present, a moderate production might be achieved after 10 years from the commencement of mining operations.   It is, however, doubtful whether maximum production would ever be possible again as it is unlikely that deep soil conditions such aspresently exist in East Lothian could ever be restored.5. Following the recent Price Review, the Government have asked the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and myself to conduct an intensivecampaign to impress on the agricultural industry the urgent need to help thenation&apos;s economy by increased food production.   The success of this campaigndepends very largely on the voluntary response of farmers throughout the country.To obtain this voluntary response we must secure and retain the support and goodwill of the leaders of the industry, th   National Farmers&apos; Unions, theLandowners&apos; organisations and the Agricultural Executive Committees,   Theproposal to begin opencast mining in East Lothian has already led to strong representations from the Scottish National Farmers&apos; Union and from theAgricultural Executive Committee concerned.   I feel sure that the psychological effect of starting operations in this area would be disastrous and would in a large measure stultify the efforts being made to secure increased production, not only in east Lothian but throughout Scotland.   On the other hand nothing would do more
at the present precarious juncture to assure the agricultural industry of our full support for their efforts than an announcement that the Government havedecided that no opencast mining will be undertaken on first-class agricultural land.6. Finally I would like to stress one consideration towhich the Minister refers in his paper and which we must take seriouslyinto account.   If the decision were to go against agriculture in East Lothian,the resultant public outcry against the surrender, as it will be represented,of agricultural interests, would undoubtedly make it much more difficult toget opencast sites in other parts of the country where the agricultural case would be less strong.7. The Minister of Agriculture endorses the views expressedin this paper.J.S.Scottish Office, S. W. 1.,JUNE 17, 1952 .
