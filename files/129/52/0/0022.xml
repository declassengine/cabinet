Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1952SECRETCABINET OFFICbRECORD copy copy No.7 2C. (52) 17223rd May, 1952CABINETTHE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS OUTLOOKMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerIntroduction and SummaryThis paper supplements my memorandum on Economic Policy (C. (52) 166):I am circulating it for the information of my colleagues; I do not ask for any decisions. Its purpose is to set out the balance of payments background for the series of papers which we shall be considering. But the points which standout are: (i) The scale of our capital commitments and the risks of our capital positionare such that the United Kingdom must run a current balance ofpayments surplus of at least  300 million a year.(ii) Our ability to get through 1952-53 without an open sterling crisis is whollyunassured, and the only chance of success is by strict economy in imports and ruthless concentration upon exports.(iii) The outlook after the middle of 1953 is no more promising than the outlook for the next twelve months; there is no &quot;hump&quot; but a continuingmountain range of difficulties.(iv) The only way out, short of a drastic revision of our external commitments of all kinds, is an expansion of exports in the next two years, pre-dominantly to non-sterling countries, of the order of 20 per cent, (or,say,  600 million) above the 1951 level.2. In order&apos; to overcome the balance of payments crisis, and to preventrepeated crises in future, three things are necessary:  3. In C. (52) 166, paragraphs 2 to 10, I set out some Of the major factors in our economic position which have a bearing on what is needed to carry out thesetasks. My objective in this paper is to describe the outlook in more detail, andto show that in my view:  (a) the task of paying our way involves not merely a balance but a large surpluson the United Kingdom current account.(b) the task is a long-term one and not merely a problem of getting over a&quot; hump &quot; in the next few months,   jj(c) The only solution consistent with maintaining our present external military,political and financial commitments lies in the improvement of our competitive power and the expansion of our export earnings on a scalefar greater than has yet been envisaged.(a) the United Kingdom must pay its way abroad;(b) the sterling area as a whole must do the same; .(c) our external capital position must be greatly strengthened.42308b
The Need for a Surplus4.   Our cash position is lamentably weak.   In six months the gold reserveshave fallen from  1,050 million to  590 million.  They are now so small in relationto our short-term debts and in relation to the amount of international business, which we transact that a further substantial fall would certainly lead quickly to open crisis.5. We must therefore conduct our affairs so that we do not risk losing reserves.This must continue until we have built the reserves up, and have strengthened our external capital position generally.6. It follows that we have to attain a large surplus in our current balance ofpayments-i.e., a large surplus of exports (visible and invisible) over imports and overseas Government expenditure. We no longer have the cushion of reserves to meet the inevitable ups and downs in our trading position and that of our sterling area partners; our own trading position must be strong enough to enable us to dowithout it.7. This task is made much more difficult by the external capital commitmentsdescribed in paragraph 6 of C (52) 166. We need a large surplus to meet thesealone contractual repayment of debt and necessary overseas investment are about 200 million a year, and on top of this we have contingent liabilities to repay debt(if our creditors call for it) which can amount to very much bigger figures. these commitments are just as real as imports if we do not pay for them by exports, welose gold. Some indication of the possible scale of all these is shown by theexperience of the first quarter of this year. Our deficit on current account was notvery large, but the capital commitments took nearly  200 million in the three months,so we lost  227 million of gold.8. A large surplus on current account, year in and year out, is thereforeindispensable. I cannot say how large a surplus we should need to avoid the risk ofperiodic open sterling crisis. For the. purpose of this paper, I have assumed  300million a year but as  200 million of this is already bespoken for contractual debtrepayment and overseas investment (almost all in the Commonwealth), which arevirtually certain to arise and are in effect a regular addition to our import bill, thereis only a tiny margin for contingent commitments and reserve-building. Even if Wecould regularly attain a surplus of  300 million, we should still be running sizeablerisks.9. For the United Kingdom to pay its way therefore requires a United King-dom surplus oh current account of at least  300 million a year and in certaincircumstances even this would not be enough.The Sterling Commonwealth10. The behaviour of other&apos; sterling area countries is vitally important. Theyare our chief creditors (we owe the Colonies over  1,000 million). The adequacyor otherwise of a United Kingdom surplus depends upon whether they are pros-prosperous or not. If they are failing to pay their way, the strain is thrown on us. Inthe last nine months, they have failed to pay their way by over  500 million. Theyhave therefore had to draw on their reserves (i.e., the sterling balances), so that ineffect we have had to repay debt. For India, Pakistan and Ceylon, the extent towhich they are entitled to do this is contractually limited, but for the rest there isan indefinite contingent liability upon us which has cost us  500 million of gold and exports since last June.11. If they pay their way, these contingent liabilities do not arise. At theCommonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; Meeting in January, I sought to persuade them of the need that they should pay their way. They have responded, and theirsituation should improve considerably in the next few months. But they are not so strong that we can expect them over a period of years to stand on their ownfeet; they depend upon a very narrow range of export products, many of whichare very vulnerable to synthetic substitution and the vagaries of world demand,and most of them are trying to carry out development programmes which are inexcess of their unaided capabilities. They have sterling reserves available,- and theywill have to use them, some time. When this, happens, the burden is thrown onus either on the gold reserves, or on our export resources. I shall continue topress them to pay their way, but we cannot rely upon their, ability-or in somecases their willingness-to do so. Least of all can we rely upon them to supportour economy and to ease our problem.
The Immediate Crisis12. The rapid worsening of the situation in the second half of last year was due to the combined effect of the appearance of large deficits in the UnitedKingdom and in the other sterling area countries. In the second half-year the combined deficit was  777 million:  Current DeficitsNon-sterling   Sterling Totalarea area2nd half 1951- (  million)United Kingdom    ...      ...      -599 +171 -428Rest of Sterling Area      ...      -178 -171 -349Total    ...      -777 - -77713.   In the first quarter of this year, the deficit has been greatly reduced:1st quarter 1952 United Kingdom   ......      -171 H-136 -35Rest of Sterling Area       ...      - 32 -136 -168Total    ...      -203 -  .        -20314. Thus, the combined deficit with the non-sterling area fell from an annual rate of over  1,500 million to about  800 million. In the current quarter, there willprobably be a further slight improvement, to an annual rate of deficit of about 700 million. It can be said therefore, that the sterling area as a whole has reduced the size of its deficit with the rest of the world by about one-half.15. But a deficit of  700 million a year is formidable when the gold reservesstand below  600 million. We have been fortunate in recent weeks in that the lossof reserves has been checked. Since the end of March, indeed, we have lost only 17 million from the reserves; if there is no worsening in &quot; confidence,&quot; the reservesat end-June may be as much as  580 million ($1,625 million)., This would be amuch better result than I expected at the beginning of April (C. (52) 111) a loss of only  27 million in the quarter, compared with a loss of  227 million in the first quarter.16. But we must not deceive ourselves. This result (if we get it) is due to two thinks: both transient. First, the 4 per cent. Bank Rate and the restrictionson overseas credit have given us a once-for-all gain our debtors have been forcedto pay their bills, and this may be worth  50 million in the quarter. Second,United States defence aid has been flowing in much faster than expected; we havealready had  27 million since March, and we now hope to get  75 million by July.These two factors alone make about  125 million in the quarter-an annual rate of 500 million a year against the deficit of  700 million a year. The respite for the reserves is very welcome, and gives us a breathing space. But that is all thecomfort there is in it.17. We must concentrate on the hard fact that the sterling area&apos;s deficit withthe rest of the world is about  700 million a year, that the gold reserves are lessthan  600 million, and that the means of finance which are at present being usedto meet the deficit are only transient.The Prospects for 1952-5318. The relevant actual figures for the second half of 1951 and our estimates for the first half of 1952 are set out in an/appendix in the appropriate amount of detail. Alongside these are set out some illustrative figures for 1952-53. Theseare based on present prices, and present policy-no easing of import cuts, and no new measures to stimulate exports.42308 B 2   -:   . -
19.   Taking the whole United Kingdom situation, currentchanges in 1952-53 compared with what has been happening in the would appear to be of the following scale.ExpenditureImports        ...Overseas GovernmentExpenditureCapital PaymentsTotalReceiptsExports and re-exportsInvisibles (net)...Defence Aid   ...Total......Loss of gold reservesFirst half 1952annual rate1952-53and capital, thefirst half of 1952Change	(  million)	3,360	3,140	-220220	220	_520	(300)	-2204,100	3,660	-4403,020	2,770	-250410	530	+ 120160	200	H- 403,590	3,500	-90510	160	-35020. This indicates clearly that on the basis of present policy, even if the inci-dence of capital payments is only  300 million&apos;(as indicated in paragraph 8 above)we should still expect to be losing gold heavily through 1952-53. Starting with 580 million at end-June, the indicated loss is  160 million, which would certainly lead us into open crisis.21. The scale of uncertainty in these figures is much too great to enableprecise deductions to be drawn, but it must be clear from this that the positionis highly precarious and no sort of assurance can be given that, on the basis of present policies, we shall be able to survive the autumn and winter. If we look at the items one by one, indeed, we see how intractable the problem is. Certainlya new series of import cuts would present great difficulty; indeed, in recent weeksI have been under considerable pressure to increase the import programme. Toreduce overseas Government expenditure involves major changes in military policy.It is perfectly true that the capital payments may be less costly than  300 million,but they may, on the other hand, be substantially more costly; in any case thesetoo are very difficult to escape within the present framework of policy. As regardsexports, the reduction compared with the present rate may be surprising to mycolleagues, but this year exports have been running at an abnormally high levelbecause of the flood of supplies to Australia, and we have made very large sales of materials from our stockpile to the United States; the indicated level for 1952-53is, in fact, higher than the level for 1951, and I do not think the President of theBoard of Trade will be prepared to assure us that we shall be able to do betterthan, this. Of course, we could always sell more exports by giving more credit.But this would increase the capital payments element on the other side of the balance sheet and therefore would not benefit our balance of payments. It may never-theless be necessary to give some credits in selected cases for the sake of our long-term competitive position. The figure for invisible income shows a substantial increase which looks rather optimistic and we are relying also upon very substantialdefence aid from the United States.22. The scale of the difficulties emerges with great clarity when we considerthe situation of the sterling area against the rest of the world. This is really another way of looking at the same thing.23. I pointed out in paragraph 17 above that at the present time the sterling area as a whole is running a deficit of about  700 million a year with the rest of theworld. The other sterling area countries/account for about  150 million of this.At the Commonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; meeting in January, and subsequently,I pressed them to cut down their expenditure so that they would have a surplus withthe non-sterling&quot; world. But it is very doubtful whether in fact they will be able todo so. Their export earnings depend largely upon the course of world demand for
wool, rubber,, cocoa, &amp;c. They have cut their imports but it is difficult to predictthe impact. They may manage to get into balance with the non-sterling world.But we certainly cannot rely on them doing more now or at any other time. the ability of the other sterling area countries to reduce their expenditure on non-sterling imports depends largely on whether our exports are competitive and freelyavailable.24. This means, as I announced in my Budget speech, that we ourselves must at least achieve a balance with the non-sterling world &quot;(including defence aid). even this is not quite good enough for we have capital commitments outside the sterling area repayment of United States and Canadian debt, oil investment overseas,possibly repayment of debt to E.P.U., repayment of sterling balances to Egypt andothers, and we are doing some and should very much like to. do more investment inCanada. At the very least, in our relations with the non-sterling world, we mustlive on our earnings plus defence aid.25. The illustrative figures in the appendix show the same conclusion as thatderived above from consideration of the total United Kingdom balance of pay-ments position. On reasonable expectations about the course of exports to thenon-sterling world, and on rather optimistic assumptions about the course of our oil and invisible earnings, it seems to me most unlikely that we shall be able to afford the level of imports from the non-sterling world which we need even tomaintain our present food consumption and to provide the raw materials for expanding industrial production. This situation can be changed only if we can do something very effective to get a quick and large expansion of exports to thenon-sterling world in conditions which look somewhat unpropitious.26. This is the state of affairs which confronts us and I must once moreemphasise to my colleagues that the capital position is so weak that we cannotrun risks and that we shall have to make our import arrangements sufficientlyflexible to enable us to keep our spending within our earnings.Prospects after mid-195321. Looking farther ahead, it is unfortunately true that there is no relief insight. None of the items in our accounts will automatically improve after nextyear. Indeed, there are at least three major loads in sight which will make theproblem worse, rather than better:  (i) We are relying on  200 million of United States aid in 1952-53. For1953-54 and subsequent years, there is not the slightest guarantee thatthere will be any United States economic aid or, even if there were,that the conditions would be acceptable. There may be United state said, but we cannot count on it.(ii) There is the uncertainty about payment for our troops in Germany upto  130 million a year and the possibility of further military expendi-ture in the Middle East (and perhaps also elsewhere),(iii) We shall need more imports. If our production and exports are toincrease, our imports must also increase, and to the extent to which weare now living on stocks, we shall need bigger imports simply to sustain the level of consumption. We cannot continue indefinitely, moreover,with our present intensive import restrictions, for sooner or later thiswill destroy our exporters&apos; opportunities. By 1953-54 we shall probablyneed another  100 million of imports without allowing any increase offood consumption.28. These new loads add up to about  400- 450 million a year comparedwith 1952-53. But in 1952-53, on present policies, there is a prospective loss ofgold reserves of about  160 million. In other words, it would seem that we haveto improve upon the prospective 1952-53 situation by about  600 million. Andeven that is not likely to permit us to improve our gold reserves, or to provide against such contingencies as a worsening of the terms of trade, or, of course, to cope with any major change in the world situation, such as an American slump.29. The fact is, therefore, that time is not on our side. This is no temporary&quot; hump,&quot; with a secure future if we can survive the next few months. Indeed, itis the reverse. Menacing though the present situation looks, our problems on thebasis of present policies will grow worse, not easier.;
30. The only way out which I can see short of a drastic revision of our externalcommitments of all kinds, is a major expansion of our overseas earnings, both fromphysical exports and invisibles. I do not myself attach great weight to detailedforecasts for a long period ahead. But the conclusion seems to me inescapablethat an expansion of something of the order of 20 per cent, in our export earnings above the 1951 level say  600 million a year is indispensable, unless we areprepared to reshape the whole of our national life. Moreover, it seems likely thatthis expansion will have to be concentrated on the difficult markets outside the sterling area, and particularly the dollar markets, for the other sterling area countries are unlikely to be able to afford to buy more than they did last year.31. In other words, our position will remain highly precarious, and we maybe swept into an open sterling crisis at any moment, until we have found means of improving our competitive power and expanding our earnings on a scale far greaterthan has yet been envisaged.32. I see no reason for surprise at the scale of the problem of putting our external financial position right. As I said in C. (52) 166, we are now the biggestdebtor in the world instead of being the biggest creditor in the world, yet we are carrying loads far greater than we ever carried before.R. A.
