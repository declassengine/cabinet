Last year a conference of officials of the four Governments drew upproposals for the federation of the three Central African territories.   these were published in June, 1951 (Cmd. 8233) and were commended by the labour government as &quot;a constructive approach to the problem&quot;.3. A Conference attended by our predecessors was held at Victoria falls in September, 1951, to discuss the proposals.   It was inconclusive, and adjournedtill mid-1952.4. In November the Cabinet, having considered C. (51) 11, authorised(a) a Parliamentary statement announcing the support of the present Governmentfor the principle of federation on the general lines of the officials&apos; report(see Cmd. 8411);  and (b) the holding of further discussions with the central african Governments in preparation for the resumption of the adjournedConference.5. These further discussions brought out clearly the urgent need to dispelmisunderstandings and misrepresentations of the federal proposals by placingbefore the public as early as possible a comprehensive draft federal scheme.Accordingly the date of the re-convened Conference was advanced to April.6. African representatives from Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland declinedan invitation to attend;  but in other respects the Conference was a success.It agreed upon a draft Federal Scheme, and set up three Commissions toexamine during the summer the problems arising in the fields of finance, thecivil service and the judiciary.7. Paragraph 12 of the preface in the forthcoming White Paper (Appendix I,page 4) summarises the Scheme.   While following the broad lines of theofficials1 recommendations it abandons the proposal to include in the Federal
Cabinet a specially appointed Minister for African Interests, strengthens the african Affairs Board and gives Parliament opportunity to examineany proposals for constitutional amendment which are not acceptable to Africans.8; The new features should help to commend the Scheme both toAfricans and to critics in this country.   We intend to ensure that it is fully understood in Central Africa, and our purpose is that a further conference should be held later in the year in Africa to consider the reports of the threeCommissions and put the Draft Scheme into final shape.   It would then besubmitted to a referendum of the Southern Rhodesia electorate and to the legislatures of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland fcr ratification.9. Before the next Conference we shall have need to consult our colleagues further on the future policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government andparticularly on the issue whether federation is to be introduced if a reasonablemeasure of African acquiescence is not forthcoming.   This crucial issue need notbe decided now.10. We propose, with the approval of our colleagues, to introduce theWhite Paper to Parliament with a statement on the lines of the draft attached(Appendix II).S.O.L.13TH JUNE, 1952

PREFACEI. background the question of closer political association between SouthernRhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland has been under con-sideration for many years. A Royal Commission under the chairman-ship of Lord Bledisloe, which reported in 1939,* concluded that thetime was not then ripe for amalgamation or (although they did notconsider such a solution in detail) for federation. The main reasonsfor the Commission^ conclusion were the differences in native policybetween Southern Rhodesia and the northern Territories, their differentstages of political and social development and the financial weakness of the northern Territories. The Commission recommended the estab-lishment of regular consultative machinery. This was set up, in theform of the Central African Council, in 1945, and it has done muchuseful work within the limits imposed by its constitution and itslack of executive powers.2. A growing consciousness of the limitations of purely consultativemachinery led, however, to the revival of the idea of closer politicalassociation and the then Secretary of State for the Colonies, the Rt.Hon. James Griffiths, M.P., stated in the House of Commons on the8th November, 1950, that His Majesty&apos;s Government had decidedthat there should be a fresh examination of the problem of the closer association of the three Territories. He announced that a conferenceof officials of the three Central African Governments, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment in the United Kingdom, and the Central African council would accordingly meet early in 1951 to examine the problem and make recommendations. That conference took place in March, 1951,under the chairmanship of Mr. G. H. Baxter of the commonwealth relations Office, and its report was published in June, simultaneously with a geographical, historical and economic survey! and a com-parative survey of native policy, g . -3. The officials&apos; report set out the need for closer association. they pointed out the economic interdependence of the three territories and the consequent importance of the integration of economic policyboth internally and in external economic relations. The Territories,for the time being relatively prosperous, were, individually, economic-ally vulnerable and would be much stronger as a single unit witha more broadly based economy. Such a unit would also be strongerfrom the standpoint of defence. Rail, trunk road and air communica-tions needed to be planned on a broader basis. The unification ofcertain public services (difficult if not impossible as things stood)would secure greater efficiency. The most efficient use, in the interestsof the people as a whole, of the capital resources of the wholeregion in finance, raw materials, power, labour and technical skillwould be promoted. A general quickening expansion of the economy of the area would bring with it advantages to all the inhabitants andin particular the possibility of the more rapid social advancement ofthe African population.  The need for action was urgent.4. The officials considered the obstacles to closer association notedby the Royal Commission and found that since that time they hadbeen materially reduced.  Certain differences in native policy between* Cmd. 5949.15918t Cmd. 8233.        J Cmd. 8234.15 Cmd. 8235.A 3
Southern Rhodesia and the northern Territories still remained but,though important, they were felt to relate largely to method and timing:the ultimate objectives of all three Governments were broadly thesame, namely, the economic, social and political advancement ofthe Africans in partnership with the Europeans. The officials notedthat Southern Rhodesia spent more on certain services for Africansthan did Northern Rhodesia or Nyasaland. They recognised theexistence and importance of African opposition in Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland, but believed that the judgment of African opinion wouldin the last resort turn on the form which a scheme of closer associationmight take. (Such a scheme is set forth in detail for the first timein the present paper.) They considered that with the growth of population, both European and African, since 1938, and with thematerial and political progress of the Territories, there should nowbe no difficulty in working effectively a scheme of closer association.Moreover, political advance in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland hadnarrowed the gap between the political institutions of Southern Rhodesiaon the one hand and the northern Territories on the other. Finally,the resources of the three Territories should now be fully adequate to support a scheme of closer association.5. The officials discussed various forms of closer association. Theynoted the view of those closely concerned with the work of theCentral African Council that an advisory body could by itself do nothing further of value to promote collaboration between the in-dividual Governments. They reviewed the idea of amalgamation(which had found favour for many years in Southern Rhodesia and elsewhere), and rejected it because, although it had many intrinsicmerits, it stood so little chance of general acceptance that, if only for that reason, it could not be recommended. They also rejected the idea of a &quot; League&quot;, whereby the three Governments woulddelegate certain functions to a body appointed by themselves, on thegrounds that it would be likely to produce friction and deadlockand that it equally stood little chance of general acceptance. they then recommended a scheme, which they discussed at length, for a federation under which the central Government would have certain specified powers, the remainder being left with the territorial Govern-ments. The constitution that they recommended would include specialsafeguards for African interests.6. The officials&apos; report was commended as a basis for discussion byall four Governments to the careful consideration of public opinion,His Majesty&apos;s Government describing it as &quot; a constructive approach to the problem &quot;, and it was announced that no decision would betaken on their proposals until there had been full discussion and time for opinion to crystallise. The then Secretaries of State for commonwealth Relations and the Colonies (the Rt. Hon. P. C. Gordon-Walker, M.P., and the Rt. Hon. James Griffiths, M.P.) visited africa in August and September of 1951 to take part in discussions withrepresentatives of all communities. Their tour concluded with a Con-ference which met at Victoria Falls in September. The nature and conclusions of that Conference are set out in a communique issued on the 21st September, and reproduced as Annex II. It was con-templated that, after further discussion within each territory andexchanges of views between the four Governments, there should be afurther Conference in 1952.
7. After the change of Government in the United Kingdom a state-menfH was made in Parliament on the 21st November, 1951, thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government were in full agreement with the victoria falls communique, and that they favoured a scheme of federation on the general lines recommended in the officials&apos; report. They believedthat such a scheme would be in the best interests of the Africanas well as the other inhabitants of the Territories. The statementspecifically endorsed the assurances set out in the Victoria Fallscommunique regarding African interests, and undertook to ensurethat they should be formally embodied in a federal constitution. HisMajesty&apos;s Government promised to further the discussions and con-consultations contemplated in the communique.8. As part of these consultations there were informal talks inLondon in January, 1952, with the Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia and the Governors of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland. HisMajesty&apos;s Government reaffirmed at this time that they could not agree to the amalgamation of the three Territories. They made a formal statement to the other Governments concerned in the following terms : &quot; Southern Rhodesia is a self-governing colony. Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland are protectorates. If the three Territories were to be amal-gamated, they would all become merged in the new self-governing state.Northern&apos;Rhodesia and Nyasaland would thus lose their separate identity(which they would retain in a Federation); and this would mean that HisMajesty&apos;s Government would have to disregard obligations which, by virtueof treaty and otherwise, they have assumed towards the two northern territories.   This they cannot do.&quot;9. After these talks it was announced that the Conference wouldbe reconvened in April, in London, to formulate a draft scheme of federation. It was announced in the House of Commons on the 4thMarch, 1952, that the detailed scheme to be prepared at the AprilConference would be published and that Her Majesty&apos;s government proposed to convene a further Conference, to be held later in 1952,to consider the detailed scheme before the question of ratificationor abandonment was finally put to the Governments concerned.II. THE APRIL CONFERENCE10. The reconvened Conference met at Lancaster House on the23rd April, 1952, under the joint chairmanship of the Most Hon. theMarquess of Salisbury (Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations)and the Rt. Hon. Oliver Lyttelton, M.P. (Secretary of State for theColonies). The Southern Rhodesian delegation was led by the PrimeMinister, the Rt. Hon. Sir Godfrey Huggins ; the, Northern Rhodesiandelegation by the Governor, Sir Gilbert Rennie ; and the Nyasalanddelegation by the Governor, Sir Geoffrey Colby. The full membership of the various delegations is given in Annex I.11. The Secretary of State for the Colonies had invited the AfricanRepresentative Council of Northern Rhodesia and the African Pro-tectorate Council of Nyasaland to send representatives to London forinformal discussions with him and to take part in the Conference.These representatives duly came to London and had informal talksII Cmd. 8411.3
at the Colonial Office before the Conference opened. During these discussions they declined the Secretary of State&apos;s invitation to attend the Conference as delegates, although he gave them assurances that by attending they would not be committing themselves in any way.The Nyasaland representatives then asked whether they might attendas observers, but when on the following day the Secretary of Stateagreed to this suggestion they withdrew it and declined to attendin any capacity. A similar invitation to attend as observers wasmade to the Northern Rhodesian representatives, who also declined.These African representatives remained in London during the Con-ference and had discussions with many interested individuals and groups. The day after the Conference closed the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies explained the findings of the Conference to them.The two African members of the Southern Rhodesian delegation onthe other hand attended the Conference and took an active part in theproceedings.III.  THE DRAFT FEDERAL SCHEME12. The scheme set forth in the present White Paper consists of detailed proposals which could if approved be translated into a. con-stitutional instrument. The following is a summary of its main features:       &apos;&quot;(i) The PreambleThe Preamble sets forth the main principles underlying the scheme.It draws attention to the desirability of the three Territories associatingfor common purposes while retaining their separate identities. Itreflects undertakings about the interests of Africans to which effect isgiven elsewhere in the scheme, and emphasises that these three Terri-tories are the rightful home of all their lawful inhabitants, whatever their origin.(ii) Chapter I.   The FederationThis Chapter proposes that the Federation shall be known as &quot; TheFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland &quot; and leaves it to the federal assembly to decide where the capital of the Federation is to be located.(iii) Chapter II.   The Federal LegislatureThis Chapter provides for the division of legislative powers betweenthe Federal and the Territorial Legislatures (which within their exclusivespheres are in no way subordinate to one another). It sets out anumber of subjects on which only the Federal Legislature may makelaws. It also specifies a number of other subjects with which both theFederal Legislature and the Territorial Legislatures may deal, pro-vided that in cases of inconsistency the Federal law will prevail. it also allows the Federal Legislature to delegate power to legislate onFederal subjects to the Territorial Legislatures, and (within certaindefined spheres) allows the Territorial Legislatures to delegate powerto the Federal Legislature. All subjects not specifically allotted tothe Federal Legislature remain the responsibility of the Territories, and care has been taken to ensure that the Territorial Legislatures retain control of those matters which most closely concern the daily life ofthe African population.
Part 3 of this Chapter provides that the Federal Assembly will con-sist of 35 members, of whom 17 will be from Southern Rhodesia, 11from Northern Rhodesia and 7 from Nyasaland. Of these 35 members,33 will be elected. There will be 9 members representing african interests; and the scheme is designed to secure that at least 6 membersof the Federal Assembly (that is to say, 2 from each Territory)shall be Africans. The scheme also provides that the Federal assembly will elect a Speaker either from among its own members or from outside, but that, if a member of the Assembly is elected as Speaker,he will thereupon vacate his seat as a member of the Assembly.(iv) Chapter III.   Legislation and procedureThis Chapter makes provision for such matters as voting in theFederal Assembly and the assent to Bills. It also prescribes that the life of the Assembly will, unless it&apos;is dissolved earlier, be five years.(v) Chapter IV.  The ExecutiveThis Chapter provides that Her Majesty will be represented in theFederation by a Governor-General. It empowers the Governor-general to appoint a Prime Minister and other Ministers and assign appropriated departments to them. It lays down that, except in certain instances where the Governor-General acts in his discretion, he will be requiredto act in accordance with the advice of his Ministers.Provision is also made in this Chapter for the Federation to delegateexecutive authority to the Territories, and (within a defined sphere) forthe Territories to delegate similar authority to the Federation.(vi) Chapter V.  The African Affairs board the African Affairs Board, apart from the Chairman, will consistof a European and an African nominated by the Governor of each territory a total membership of seven. The Chairman and themembers of this Board will be independent of the Federal assembly and Executive, and the Chairman will be appointed by the Governor-General with the approval of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. The Board&apos;spowers are designed to ensure that any Federal legislation which appears to the Board to differentiate either in terms or in operationbetween Europeans and Africans, to the disadvantage of the latter, willrequire to be referred to Her Majesty&apos;s Government. In addition;the Board will be entitled to make representations to the federal government on any matters affecting African interests.(vii) Chapter VI.  finance the question of the finances of the Federation requires furtherexpert examination and is being referred to a Fiscal Commission, whoseterms of reference are set out in this Chapter. The Commission willbe required to investigate the financial consequences of setting upthe Federation and to make recommendations about revenue andexpenditure, borrowing powers and the transfer of assets and liabilitiesfrom the Territorial Governments to the Federation.(viii) Chapter VII.   The Federal Public service this Chapter is divided into two parts. The first part refers tothe setting up of a Civil Service Preparatory Commission which is towork out the details of how the Federal Public Service is to beestablished, including the arrangements for transfer to the federal public Service of some of the officers and other employees at presentserving in the Territorial Civil Services.5
The second part of this Chapter provides for the setting up of apermanent Public Service Commission which will recommend appoint-ments, promotions and transfers in the Federal Public Service oncelit is established.(ix) Chapter VIII.  The Federal JudicatureThis Chapter provides for the establishment of a Federal SupremeCourt whose members will include at least three Judges who are not members of the High Courts of the three Territories. It is intended that this Court shall have original jurisdiction and also be the Courtof first appeal from the High Courts of the three Territories. Anumber of other matters connected with the establishment of theFederal Supreme Court will require further examination by a JudicialCommission, whose terms of reference are also given in this Chapter.(x) Chapter IX.   MiscellaneousThis Chapter deals with a number of matters not dealt with in otherparts of the scheme. Included among these are the provisions forthe amendment of the Constitution. These require that all amendmentsmust be carried by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of the Federal Assembly and be reserved for the signification ofHer Majesty&apos;s pleasure. There is also provision that if a TerritorialLegislature or the African Affairs Board has objected to any Billto amend the Constitution Her Majesty&apos;s assent to the Bill can begiven only by Order in Council which would be laid in draft beforethe United Kingdom Parliament. The scheme makes it clear that power to amend the Constitution includes power to institute a second chamber if at any time that is thought desirable.CONCLUSION13. The scheme endeavours to safeguard the essential interests ofthe three Territories and all their inhabitants and to strike a fair balance between the need to create a Federation possessing, botheconomically and politically, adequate scope and strength for its workand the requirement that the Territories themselves shall continue to exist as vigorous entities, independent of the Federation within the sphere of government assigned to them.(Sgd.)

They have been inserted to give some flexibility to the working of theConstitution, but, in order to prevent weakening of the essential functions of theTerritorial Legislatures, the power of delegation by them has been limited and defined..
such: Territory with respect to any non-Federal matter for the followingpurposes, that is to say--(i) the creation and regulation of any corporate body or other authority to exercise functions in respect of more than oneTerritory; or(ii) the establishment and regulation of schools for specialcategories of pupils ; or(iii) the regulation of veterinary research, animal health, andtsetse control and research, and the establishment of such services as may be necessary for that purpose.(c) The Legislature of a Territory will also, subject as afore-said, have power to delegate to the Federal Legislature authority to legislate for such Territory with respect to any non-Federal matter which, in the opinion of the Territorial Legislature, is ancillary to, orclosely related to, any Federal or Concurrent matter and should beprovided for in a Federal law which deals with such Federal matteror Concurrent matter: Provided that, when it so delegates authorityto legislate with respect to any non-Federal matter, a Territorial Legis-lature will be required to specify the Federal or Concurrent matter towhich, in its opinion, the non-Federal matter relates or is ancillary,and the Federal Legislature will not legislate with respect to such non-Federal matter except by a law which also deals with such Federal orConcurrent matter.(3) (a) Either Legislature will have power to revoke any legisla-tive authority which it has delegated to the other.(b) Any law by which legislative authority is delegated byone Legislature to the other will prescribe a period of notice whichmust be given before such authority is revoked ; and, except with theconcurrence of the other Legislature, the delegating Legislature willnot revoke the delegated authority except after giving the prescribednotice of its intention so to do.(4) When any legislative authority delegated by the federal legislature to a Territorial Legislature is revoked or spent, any law which has been enacted by the Territorial Legislature in pursuance ofthat authority will remain in force but will be subject to amendmentand repeal by the Federal Legislature.Likewise, when any legislative authority delegated by a TerritorialLegislature to the Federal Legislature is revoked or spent, any law which has been enacted by the Federal Legislature in pursuance ofthat authority will remain in force but will be subject to amendmentand repeal by the Territorial Legislature.(5) When authority to legislate with respect to any matter isdelegated by the Federal Legislature to a Territorial Legislature orvice versa, this will not preclude the delegating Legislature from itselfcontinuing to legislate with respect to such matter i.e. the federation and the Territory will (until the delegated authority is revoked or spent)have concurrent powers of legislation within the delegated field, withFederal law prevailing over Territorial law in case of inconsistency.1&apos;0

The power to make laws relating to trade unions and industrial Tradeconciliation will remain Territorial^&apos;1) ; and the power of the Federal unions andLegislature to legislate on any matter in the Federal Legislative List industrialwill not, therefore, include power to legislate on trade unions or indus- conciliation,trial conciliation.4. The Federal Legislature will be empowered to make laws on LeKjsiationmatters incidental to the execution of any power vested by the Con- on incidentalstitution in the Federal Legislature or in the Government of the Federa- matters,tion or in the Federal Judicature or in any officer or department of theFederation, including the appointment of persons for the execution ofsuch powers.A Territorial Legislature will similarly be empowered to make lawson matters incidental to the execution of any Territorial power.(10) One of the objects of including this item in the Concurrent List is to enable theFederal Government to provide uniform standards of recruitment and training for all european Police Officers throughout the three Territories, while at the same timeleaving the Territorial Police Forces responsible to the Territorial Governments in theexecution of their duties.The Federal Government will also be empowered by this provision to providecertain common specialised police services, e.g. the C.I.D. and the Fingerprint Bureau,and to maintain a Police Force Central Reserve, members of which could be madeavailable to the Territorial Governments on loan or secondment on a contractual basis.In addition, the Federal Government will require to have its own law enforcementofficers of all ranks for a number of services which appear in the Federal LegislativeList, e.g. Customs and Immigration. If the Federal capital is declared to be &quot; extra-territorial &quot; it will also require police to maintain law and order in the area.(&quot;) One of the reasons for placing this item in the Concurrent List is that in the&apos; Northern Territories a number of public health regulations are enacted and enforcedby the Native Authorities. As a general principle it is considered that regulations made under a Federal law should not apply to Native Authorities and it is thereforeintended that such regulations should be made under Territorial legislation.(12) See Chapter II, Part 3, paragraphs 3 (1) (h), 13, 14 (5) and Chapter VIII.03) See Chapter VI.(&apos;4) This is necessary as an interim measure in view of the differences which exist atpreseDt between the Territories in the laws relating to trade unions and industrialconciliation. So far as Federal Government undertakings are concerned, the Confer-ence considered that an obligation should be placed on the Federal Government topromote the adoption in agreement with the three Territorial Governments of unifiedmachinery for industrial conciliation.      - i

GENERALIntroductory 1. A Fiscal Commission is being set up to investigate and report onNote. what financiai arrangements should be made for a Federation of thethree Territories. The terms of reference to be given to this commission are as follows:  &quot; (1) To assess the effect of the creation of a Federation ofSouthern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland on the public expenditure of the Federal area as a whole, and in particular toestimate, after taking account of the transfer of assets and liabilitiesinvolved, the net cost of id) Federal services under the proposed Federation ;(b) the services remaining to be undertaken by the constituentGovernments ;bearing in mind the need for the maximum economy in administrationcompatible with the basic purposes of the proposed Federation.(2) In the light of (1) above, and in the light of the allocation of sources of revenue set out in Chapter VI of the Draft federal scheme, to undertake an enquiry into the means whereby the revenues available, or to be made available, to the three con-stituent Governments and to the Federal Government under theproposed Federation should best be collected and distributed betweenthe Federal Government and the constituent Governments, havingregard on the one hand to the need to preserve to the constituentTerritories financial autonomy within the sphere of governmentassigned to them, and on the other hand to the importance of ensuring that the financial resources of the area comprised by theproposed Federation are applied for the benefit of the area as awhole.
(3) To consider, in particular, what form of taxation on incomeswould be best adapted to the needs of such a Federal system, bear-ing in mind the desirability of ensuring, so far as circumstances permit,a uniform practice throughout the Federal area as regards reliefs and allowances.(4) To consider, in the light of the fundamental importance of en-suring co-ordination of loan policies, what arrangements could mostsuitably be made between the Federal Government and the constituentGovernments as regards external and internal government borrowing.(5) To undertake an enquiry into the internal and external problemscreated by a decision to establish a Customs Union of the three Terri-tories constituting the proposed Federation and to consider the means by which these problems can best be solved in the interests of theFederal area.(6) To consider the steps which should be taken to bring theCustoms Union into full effect as expeditiously as possible andat any rate within a period of not more than two years fromthe decision to establish such a Union.(7) To submit recommendations on the above subjects to theGovernments of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland, and to Her Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom.&quot;In the matter of income tax the Conference noted from a study ofother federal systems that it has in general been found best to arrangefor basic income tax to be assessed and collected on a federal basis.It took the view that so far as possible income tax law and administra-tion should be unified.  This would apply to all taxes on income.2. Until the Fiscal Commission has submitted its report it is notpossible to set out in detail what the financial arrangements for theFederation would be. They should however be on the following general pattern.3. As will be seen from the terms of reference the distribution of income tax between the Federation and the Territories will be oneof the matters on which the Fiscal Commission will make recom-mendations. In addition to any taxes on income which may be assigned to the Federation as a result of these recommendations andsubject to any overriding considerations to which the Fiscal commission may draw attention the Federation should have the followingrevenues : (a) The produce of Customs and Excise.(b) Postal, Telephones and Telecommunications revenues.(c) Fees for services rendered by the Federal Government andsuch other revenues as may accrue to the Federation in con-nection with any matter within the jurisdiction of theFederation.4. All revenues or other moneys raised or received by the Government Consolidatedof the Federation will form one Consolidated Revenue Fund to be Revenueappropriated for the purposes of the Federation in the manner pre- FunQ-scribed by the Constitution and subject to the charges imposed thereby.revenues of theFederation.
nilCharges on       5. (a) The cost of the collection and management of the ConsolidatedConsolidated Revenue Fund will form a first charge on the Fund.Revenue 0Fund. (b) The Constitution will also charge upon the ConsolidatedRevenue Fund the emoluments of the Governor-General, the chief justice and other Judges of the Federal Supreme Court and the Chair-man and other members of the African Affairs Board.6. All such costs, charges and expenses will be reviewed and auditedin such manner as may be laid down by Federal law.7. Money will be withdrawn from the Consolidated Revenue Fundonly under appropriation made by law but provision will be made onthe usual lines whereby, in advance of parliamentary appropriation,money can in certain circumstances be made available to meet un-foreseen expenditure and to cover any period, not exceeding four months, between the end of a financial year and the passing of the appropriation Act for the following year.Audit.Appropria-tions.PART 2.  BORROWING1. The Fiscal Commission is being directed (cf. terms of reference(4)) to consider, in the light of the fundamental importance of ensuringco-ordination of loan policies, what arrangements could most suitablybe made between the Federal Government and the Territorial Govern-ments as regards external and internal government borrowing. Itappears that such co-ordination could best be achieved by the establish-ment of a Loans Council for the Federation on the model of theLoan Council of Australia which has executive powers over certain aspects of governmental borrowing. This Council would be repre-sentative of the Federal Government and the three Territorial Govern-ments. It is envisaged that it would deal solely with government borrowing outside the Federal area by the three Territorial Govern-ments and by the Federal Government.2. No final arrangements can be proposed for external and internalborrowing by the Federal Government and the Territorial Governmentsuntil the Fiscal Commission has reported on this matter, particularly as the question of loans is to some extent connected with the questionof revenues.PART 3.   TRANSFER OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIESIn the course of its deliberations the Fiscal Commission will consider what assets and liabilities it will be necessary or desirable to transfer from the Territories to the Federation and the terms on which suchtransfers should take place.
nsrTHE FEDERAL PUBLIC SERVICEPART 1.   CIVIL SERVICE PREPARATORY COMMISSIONIn order to work out the details of how the Federal Public service is to be established a Commission of Enquiry, to be known as theCivil Service Preparatory Commission, is being set up with the follow-ing terms of reference:  &quot; (1) In the light of the provisions of the Draft Federal Scheme,and in particular of the provisions of Part 2 of Chapter VII, tomake recommendations concerning the establishment of a federal public Service&apos;34&apos; and in particular for the following matters:  (i) initial arrangements for the transfer to the Federal PublicService of those functions which are to be transferred fromTerritorial to Federal control;(ii) organisation and structure of the Federal Public Service ;(iii) terms and conditions of service of officers and other employeesappointed to the Federal Public Service ;(iv) arrangements for the transfer to the Federal Public Serviceof those officers and other employees at present serving inthe Territories who will be required to staff Federal services ;(In making recommendations on this subject the Prepara-tory Commission shall have regard to the need for preservation-tion of existing rights and avenues of advancement of such officers and employees.)(v) arrangements which should govern the grant of the right to retire on abolition-of-office terms to officers and other employees who are at present staffing such services of theTerritorial Governments as are to be transferred to theFederal Government and who elect not to accept appoint-ment in the Federal Public Service.(2) To consider what steps should be taken to work towardsuniformity in terms and conditions of service between the federal public Service and the Territorial Public Services in order toencourage interchangeability of staff between these four services.&quot;PART 2.

(1) There will be a Public Service Commission^35) to advise theGovernor-General in the exercise of the powers conferred on him by paragraph 2 above.(2) (a) The Public Service Commission will consist of such persons as the Governor-General may appoint, one of whom theGovernor-General will nominate as Chairman of the Commission.(b) No person will be appointed as or will remain a memberof the Public Service Commission if he is a member of the federal legislature or of any Territorial Legislature.4. (1) In the exercise of the powers referred to in paragraph 2 abovethe Governor-General will act after consultation with the Public service commission.(2) The Public Service Commission will have such other functions as may be assigned to it by law or regulations enacted in pursuanceof paragraph 6 below.5. The Governor-General may delegate to any person or authority in the Federation any of the powers conferred on him by paragraph above. The Governor-General may delegate any such power subjectto such limitations and conditions as he may think fit, and in particularmay require the person or authority to whom the power is delegated to exercise such power with the advice of the Public Service Com-mission and may prescribe whether or not such person is to act inaccordance with the advice of the Public Service Commission.6. (1) The Federal Legislature will be empowered to make laws forgiving effect to the foregoing provisions of this Part and in particular for the following matters: -(a) additional functions of the Public Service Commission ;(b) appointment of temporary members of the Commission (includ-ing a temporary Chairman) ;(c) tenure of office and other terms of service of members (includ-ing temporary members) of the Commission ;(d) organisation of work of the Commission and the manner inwhich it shall perform its functions ;(e) staff of the Commission and their terms of service ;(f) delegation to any member of the Commission of any of theCommission^ functions.(2) Until the Federal Legislature makes provision for the matters referred to in sub-paragraph (1) above, the Governor-General maymake provision for such matters by regulations. Such regulations willbe subject to revocation and amendment by Federal law.7. The conditions of service, including pensions, gratuities and otherlike benefits, of public officers (and their widows, children, dependantsand personal representatives) which might be affected by the establish-ment of the Federation, will be preserved. This will also apply toformer public officers who, although retired or transferred elsewhere,are entitled to such benefits.(&quot;) The Public Service Commission would be a continuing body quite distinct fromthe Preparatory Commission referred to in Part 1 of this Chapter.
THE FEDERAL JUDICATURE1. (1) The Federal Supreme Court will consist of a President, and Federalsuch other judges as the Governor-General may appoint, one of whom ^&quot;Prretmemay be designated Vice-President.(2) A judge will not be removed from office except by theGovernor-General on an address from the Federal Assembly prayingfor such removal on the ground of misbehaviour or incapacity orinfirmity of mind or body.(3) The judges will receive such remuneration as may be pre-scribed by Federal law but the remuneration of a judge will not be diminished during his tenure of office.2. If, in proceedings in any other court in the Federation, any ques- Jurisdictiontion arises as to the interpretation of the Constitution, the court will inconstitu-have power to refer such question directly to the Federal Supreme ^&quot;fe^Court.3. The Federal Supreme Court will have original jurisdiction in pro- Originalceedings between Territorial Governments or between the Federal jurisdiction.Government and any Territorial  Government,  and in such  othermatters(36) as may be prescribed.4. The Federal Supreme Court will have jurisdiction to hear and Appellatedetermine- jurisdiction.(a) appeals from its own original side, in so far as such appealsare provided for by Federal law ;(b) appeals from Territorial Courts in matters arising under Terri-torial law, in so far as such appeals are provided for byTerritorial law ; and(c) appeals from Territorial Courts in matters arising underFederal law, in so far as such appeals are provided for byTerritorial or Federal law.5. Subject to the preceding paragraphs of this Chapter, jurisdiction in civil and criminal proceedings arising under Federal law will, unless it is otherwise provided by Federal law, vest in and be exercised byTerritorial Courts as if the Federal law in question were a Territoriallaw.6. The establishment of the Federal Judicature is largely a tech-nical matter which will have to be studied and reported on later bya Judicial Commission. The terms of reference of this commission will be as follows:  &quot; To consider in the light of the proposals in the Draft federal scheme, particularly Chapter VIII thereof : (i) the constitution of the Federal Supreme Court, whose members shall include at least three judges who are not members of the High Courts of the three Territories ;(36) These other matters should be comparatively few. Whether any of them need to be described in the Constitution itself cannot be decided until the Judicial Com-mission has reported see paragraph 6 below.
(ii) the jurisdiction of the Federal Supreme Court, original andappellate ;(iii) appeals from the Federal Supreme Court;(iv) the legislative authority of the Legislatures of the federation and the Territories respectively in relation to the jurisdiction of the Federal Supreme Court;(v) the making of Rules of Court for the Federal Supreme Courtincluding rules regulating the procedure in questions regard-ing membership of the Federal Assembly which come beforethe Court under Chapter II, Part 3, of the Draft federal scheme ;and to make recommendations.&quot;CHAPTER IXAdaptationof existinglaws.RightsreservedunderLewanikaconcessions.Penalty forsitting orvoting inFederalAssemblywhen un-qualified.Federal lawsmay be laid on table ofTerritorialLegislatures.MISCELLANEOUS1. At the commencement of the Federation there will be in existencea number of Territorial laws relating to matters which will under theConstitution become Federal matters. The Federal Legislature willhave to make provision for such laws to be construed in a manner which conforms to the provisions of the Constitution (e.g. by the sub-stitution of references to Federal authorities for references to Territorialauthorities). It may, however, be necessary to make some such pro-visions before the Constitution comes fully into operation. TheGovernor-General will, therefore, be empowered in his discretion tomake formal adaptations in Territorial laws for this purpose at anytime before the first meeting of the Executive Council.2. To preserve the rights reserved under the Lewanika concessionsthe Constitution will contain a provision similar to section 41 of theNorthern Rhodesia Order in Council, 1924, which reads as follows:  &quot;41. (1) It shall not be lawful for any purpose whatever, except with the consent of the Chief of the Barotse and with the approvalof the Secretary of State, to alienate from the Chief and peopleof the Barotse the territory reserved from prospecting by virtue ofthe concessions from Lewanika to the British South Africa Company,dated the 17th day of October, 1900, and the 11th day of August,1909.(2) All rights reserved to or for the benefit of natives bythe aforesaid concessions as approved by the Secretary of State shall continue to have full force and effect.&quot;3. A person who sits or votes in the Federal Assembly knowing or having reasonable grounds for knowing that he is not entitled so todo will be liable to a penalty not exceeding twenty pounds for everyday on which he so sits or votes. The penalty will be recoverableby action in the Federal Supreme Court at the suit of the Attorney-General of the Federation.4. To reduce the risk of litigation on constitutional questions wherethe Federal Legislature and all three Territorial Legislatures are agreed,the Constitution will contain a section on the following Tines:  
&quot; (1) If the Federal Assembly by resolution directs that any federal law shall be laid upon the table of each Territorial Legislature,such law shall be so laid as soon as is practicable thereafter:Provided that no resolution shall be passed in pursuance of this subsection later than one month after the date of enactment of thelaw to which it relates.(2) At any time within a period of six months after a federal law has been laid on the table of a Territorial Legislature in pur-suance of subsection (1) of this section (which period is hereinafter referred to as &quot; the prescribed period&quot;) such Legislature may by resolution declare that it is not satisfied that the law relates onlyto Federal matters.(3) If-id) a Federal law has been laid on the table of each TerritorialLegislature in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section ;and (b)) no Territorial Legislature has, within the prescribed period,made in respect of that law such a declaration as is referredto in subsection (2) of this section,then (except in any proceedings which have already been commenced)the validity of that law shall not be questioned in any court on theground that the law relates to matters other than Federal matters.(4) (a) In this section the expression &quot; Federal matters &quot; used inrelation to a Federal law means matters with respect to which theFederal Legislature had authority to legislate at the time when suchlaw was enacted.ib) For the purposes of this section the date of enactment ofa law shall be the date on which such law is assented to.&quot;5. (1) The provisions of the Constitution will be subject to amend- Amendmentment by Federal law : Provided that a Bill for the amendment of the of constitution (hereinafter referred to as a &quot; constitutional Bill&quot;)-        Constitutionid) will require to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the total membership of the Federal Assembly excluding the Speaker ;and (b)) will not be assented to by the Governor-General but will be reserved by him for the signification of Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure.(2) Her Majesty&apos;s assent to a constitutional Bill will be requiredto be signified by Order in Council id) if any Territorial Legislature by resolution objects to the bill or to any provision thereof within sixty days after the bill has been passed by the Federal Assembly ; orib) if, under Chapter V, a notice of objection to the Bill by the african Affairs Board is laid before the Governor-General atthe time when the Bill is presented to him for the Royal assent.(3) No draft of an Order in Council signifying Her Majesty&apos;assent to a constitutional Bill will be presented to Her Majesty unless-(a) a copy of the draft has been laid before both Houses ofParliament; and
(&amp;) neither House has, within a period of forty days beginning with the day on which the copy of the draft is laid before it,resolved that the draft should not be presented to Her Majesty.(4) Her Majesty&apos;s assent to a constitutional Bill will, when it isnot required to be signified by Order in Council, be signified through a Secretary of State/&apos;7&apos; but will not be so signified sooner than sixty-five days after the Bill has been passed by the Federal Assembly unlesswithin that time the Legislatures of all three Territories have passedresolutions to the effect that they do not propose to object to the bill or to any provision thereof under sub-paragraph (2) (a) above.(5) The power to amend the Constitution by Federal law will include power to establish and constitute a second chamber of theFederal Legislature and to prescribe its functions and generally to make,such amendments of the Constitution as may be considered necessary or expedient in consequence of the establishment of such second chamber.C37) This is the normal way of signifying the Royal assent to a Bill which has been reserved.

FINAL COMMUNIQUE OF THE VICTORIA FALLSCONFERENCE ON THE CLOSER ASSOCIATION OFTHE CENTRAL AFRICAN territories the Victoria Falls Conference issued the following communique after its finalmeeting on Friday, September 21st, 1951: 1. The present Conference was convened by the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland for the purposeof discussing the question of Closer Association of the British territories in central africa.2. The Conference opened at Victoria Falls on Tuesday, 18th September, andwas of a representative character. In the case of Southern Rhodesia the representativesincluded the Prime Minister and other Ministers and leaders of the Opposition parties in Parliament. In the case of Northern Rhodesia the delegation consisted of theGovernor and official and unofficial members of the Legislative Council, includingAfricans. Nyasaland was represented by the Governor, senior officials and leadingunofficial persons, European and African. The United Kingdom delegationconsisted of the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and for Commonwealth Relations,accompanied by some of their chief advisers.3. The Conference had before it the Report prepared last March by a numberof senior official advisers of the four Governments concerned. The authors of that report had been requested &quot; to examine the problem in all its aspects and considerwhether it is possible in the light of this examination for them to formulate proposalsfor a further advance to be made in the closer association of the three Central african territories which they could recommend to the Governments of these territories and to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom&quot;. Their work waspurely exploratory and did not commit any of the participating Governments to theadoption of any proposals that they might formulate.4. The Report of the London Conference of officials was unanimous on all points. Its main recommendation was that closer association between the three territories ought to be brought about and that the need for this is urgent. Itrecommended further that this should be done not by amalgamation of the territories, but on a federal basis; and put forward in some detail a schemeframed to take particular account of the special features of the Central Africansituation, including the self-governing status of Southern Rhodesia, and designedto provide substantial safeguards for the interests of Africans. Moreover, those matters most closely affecting the life of Africans would under the proposals in theReport come within the territorial and not within the federal sphere; and withinthe territorial sphere the Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland Governments would remain responsible as at present to His Majesty&apos;s Government in the UnitedKingdom.5. In announcing the present Conference it has from the outset been made clearthat there was no intention of reaching decisions at it binding on any Government.It was realised that such a conference might disclose points of difference with regardto the principle of federation as well as to the proposals made in the Report to bring it into being. This has proved to be the case. It has become evident that further discussion within each territory and exchanges of views between the four governments will be necessary, and the Conference has therefore adjourned. Itis hoped that the position can be sufficiently clarified to enable the Conference toreassemble in London about the middle of next year.6. On the main question of federation, as so far presented and examined, theConference, with the exception ofthe African representatives, showed itself favourable to the principle of federation. The representatives of African interests in northern rhodesia explained that Africans would be willing to consider the question of federation on the basis of the Report of the London Conference of officials afterthe policy of partnership in Northern Rhodesia had been defined and, as so defined,put into progressive operation.
7. There was general agreement in the Conference that economic and politicalpartnership between Europeans and Africans is the only policy under whichfederation could be brought about in the conditions of Central Africa, and it was recognised that any scheme of closer association would have to give full effect to that principle.8. The Conference was gravely concerned at the dangers which would flow fromany weakening or dilution of the British connection and British traditions and principles in the three territories and agreed that they should so be strengthenedas to ensure that they should continue to prevail.9. The Conference recognised the advantages which if an acceptable scheme with adequate safeguards for all could be agreed upon would arise from the commonhandling of problems that transcend territorial boundaries, such as communications,research, defence, higher education, and the planning of economic development.10. It has however been made clear at the Conference that one of the mainobstacles to the general acceptance of federation rests in the apprehensions felt byAfricans in the two northern territories that federation might impair their positionand prospects in the respective territories.11. The Conference agreed that in any further consideration of proposals for federation: (i) The protectorate status of the two northern territories would be accepted and preserved. This therefore excludes any consideration now or in thefuture of amalgamation of the three territories unless a majority of theinhabitants of ail three territories desired it.(ii) Land and land-settlement questions in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasalandmust remain, as at present (subject to the ultimate authority of HisMajesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom), the responsibility of theterritorial Government and Legislature-in each territory and not of anyfederal authority. The land rights of the African people in northern rhodesia and Nyasaland must remain secured in accordance with theexisting Orders in Council on the subject.(iii) The political advancement of the peoples of Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland, both in local and territorial government, must remain as atpresent (subject to the ultimate authority of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom) the responsibility of the Government andLegislature of each territory, and not of any federal authority.12. It was further agreed that if any form of closer association is eventually decided on all these rights should be enshrined as an integral part of the constitution.13. The Conference did not reach the stage of discussing the constitution and powers of the Federal Parliament, but the Southern Rhodesian delegation intimated that there were certain points in the Report as written with which they do not agreeand which should be discussed with all concerned before the resumed conference is held. These points would not weaken the powers of the territorial legislaturesreferred Jo in paragraph 11 above.14. The Conference understood that other delegations might also have reservationson points in the Report as written.(1591S)   Wt. 674-1216   K 20   6/52   D.L.PRINTED    IN   GREAT    BRITAIN
APPENDIX IIThe House will recall that in the course of a debate on the 4th Marchit was explained that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were increasingly conscious of the need to prepare and place before the public as early as possible adefinite draft scheme for the federation of Southern Rhodesia, Northern rhodesia and Nyasaland.   The absence of a detailed picture was responsible for many of the anxieties and suspicions that have found expression in some quarters, both in thiscountry and in the three territories, about such a federation.   Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment had therefore decided that the Conference which adjourned at victoria falls last September should be invited to reassemble in London in April, and thatits principal task should be the drawing up of a draft constitutional scheme whichwou-d take account of the recommendations made in the officials&apos; report in 1951(Cmd. 8233) and of any modifications therein which the Central african governments might wish to propose.The Conference duly met on the 23rd April at Lancaster House andremained in session until the 5th May.   My colleague the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies and I led the United Kingdom delegation.   The Southern Rhodesiandelegation included the Prime Minister and other Ministers as well as membersof the Opposition Parties and two Africans.   The Northern Rhodesian delegationconsisted of the Governor and official and unofficial members of the LegislativeCouncil.   The Nyasaland delegation included the Governor, senior officials and leading unofficials.   It was a matter of great regret to the Conference and toHer Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdom that African representativesof the African Representative Council of Northern Rhodesia and the AfricanProtectorate Council of Nyasaland who had come to London declined an invitation to participate in the Conference or even to attend as observers.   TheConference faced the many difficult issues involved with determination and goodwill, and a draft federal scheme was agreed upon which is being publishedtoday as a White Paper.The Conference also decided to set up three Commissions which duringthe summer would investigate the financial, administrative and judicial problemsattending the establishment of a federation in Central Africa.   It is the intentionof Her Majesty&apos;s Government that, after these Commissions have reported, afurther Conference shall be held in Africa later in the year to give final shape tothe federal scheme.   Her Majesty&apos;s Government and the Central african governments would then decide whether, subject to ratification in the three territories, the scheme in its final shape shall be approved.It is our earnest hope that meanwhile the public here and in central africa, and in particular the leaders of African opinion, will study very carefully the details of the Draft Federal Scheme now published, before they reach conclusions about it.   For a summary of the Scheme, I would refer the house to the Preface to the White Paper.   I wish to draw special attention to certain features in it.   Why at the outset do we aim at a federal form of government?Members will find on page 3 of the White Paper a statement of the reasons whyHer Majesty&apos;s Government have rejected the alternative of amalgamation.We believe nevertheless that the closer political association of the three terri-tories is urgently needed in the interests of all their inhabitants.   A federal scheme will satisfy that need while at the same time reserving to the separate territorial governments, which would retain their existing relationship to Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, the handling of those matters affecting most closely the day-to-daylife of the African.   That is a fundamental feature of the scheme whichshould appeal to African opinion.
In order to ensure that a close and effective watch is kept onAfrican interests in the federal sphere we propose to set up a special instrument,the African Affairs Board.   We could not accept the original recommendation of the officials&apos; conference that the Chairman of the Board, appointed by theGovernor-General with the approval of the Secretary of State, should have a seatin the Cabinet.   This seemed to us constitutionally unsound.   But we give theBoard statutory right of direct access to the Prime Minister and the ExecutiveCouncil;  we introduce qualifications for membership which will make the Boardindependent of the Legislatures and the Executive of both the Federation and the territories;  and we empower it not only to make representations in the interestsof Africans on any matter within the competence of the Federation but also toensure that any legislation which it regards as differentiating, in terms or in its application, between Europeans and Africans to the disadvantage of the latter shallbe referred to Her Majesty&apos;s Government.   The vital importance of this provision is unquestionable.   We believe that the present proposal is both constitutionallymore satisfactory and will prove more effective in protecting the interests of africans.Moreover in the preparation of the draft scheme we have carried out our promise that certain rights of which the African is particularly jealous shouldbe formally embodied in the Constitution.   Land and land settlement questions are reserved to the territorial Governments;  the Federal Government has no power to acquire land except for the necessary discharge of its proper functions,for example for the extension of a railway line, and always in accordance with existing Orders in Council and relevant legislation.   The continuance of the protectorate status of the two northern territories and the continuedresponsibility of the Territorial Governments for local and territorial politicaladvancement are emphasised.   Lastly, very important provisions have been included in regard to future constitutional changes.   All amendments oftheConstitution will require to be passed by a two-thirds majority of the membership of the Federal Assembly and will be reserved for Her Majesty&apos;s pleasure.More than that, if objection is raised to any proposed amendment either by the african Affairs Board or by a Territorial Legislature, then the amendment can onlybe made by Order in Council, and the draft Order will be laid before Parliamenthere for forty days before it is made.The federal proposals published today take full and fair account of theinterests of all the inhabitants of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland.   They offer the framework of a new political organism which webelieve will satisfy the needs of Central Africa and promote the welfare of thethree territories and all their inhabitants.   We earnestly hope that the DraftFederal Scheme will be very carefully studied, both here and in Central Africa,and that as a result of the discussions upon it the constituencies tion of a federation on thebasis proposed will eventually be approved.
