Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1952CABINET OFFiCfcCONFIDENTIAL RECORD COP Copy No.C. (52) 19112th June, 1952CABINETPRIVILEGES AND IMMUNITIES FOR INTERNATIONALORGANISATIONSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsEvery Order in Council conferring immunities and privileges upon an inter-national organisation must be approved by an affirmative resolution of both houses of Parliament (International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950).At the present time Orders in Council are ready for presentation or are in preparation in respect of a number of international organisations (see Annex III).Several relate to Specialised Agencies of the United Nations.2. I am now asking my colleagues to consider whether these draft orders should be submitted to Parliament for approval. The subject is admittedly an awkward one. Parliament is traditionally disinclined to grant special facilities inthe United Kingdom to persons whether foreigners or British subjects, just becausethey happen to work in an international organisation of which Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment is a member. The House of Lords has been particularly critical, and ex-Lord Chancellors and others have expressed concern at the extension of diplo-matic or lesser forms of privilege or immunity to an ever-widening class of persons.Any privilege or immunity granted to these individuals must, it is said, be grantedat the expense of persons whom they wrong. Any extension has, therefore, been represented as a deprivation of the rights of ordinary citizens and as conflicting withthe general principles of equality before the law and with the observance of the rule of the law. In October 1950 a draft Order relating to the Universal Postal Union(U.P.U.) was withdrawn by His Majesty&apos;s Government after discussion in the Houseof Lords. With regard to this organisation, it was claimed that as the UniOh had operated successfully for some seventy-five years without any special grant of privileges or immunities none were needed now. While recognising the force ofthese arguments, I consider that they are more theoretical than practical, and I am convinced that there is a strong case for proceeding with the Orders for the following reasons.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have taken a prominent part in international legislation for the setting up of the organisations in question and have consistentlyadvocated, with some measure of success, that the minimum of privileges should be recommended for these organisations consistent with their efficient operation. Ifwe refuse to take the necessary legislative action in the United Kingdom to grantprivileges to the particular organisations now in question we should be departing froma policy which has been consistently followed since the war. It would in my view be difficult to defend or explain such a change of policy and other countries would regard any grounds which we could adduce as trivial. Particularly would this be so42396 B
in the case of France, Switzerland and the United States, in which countries many-important organisations have their seats and where the great body of &quot; internationalcivil servants &quot; operates. If, in the case of the U.P.U., an exception were madebecause the Union had functioned efficiently in the past, this would seem bothinconsistent and discriminatory.4. The history of the matter, and the effect of the Orders now to be made are set out in Annex I to this paper. It will be seen from paragraph 5 that her majesty&apos;s Government cannot accede to a Convention in respect of a specialised agency of the United Nations unless they bind themselves to the grant of theseprivileges and immunities. Similarly, Her Majesty&apos;s Government should not ratify,without reservation (which may not be possible), any agreements concerning anyother organisations until the privileges and immunities provided by such agreements have been granted by Order in Council. The International Wheat Council is an example of a case where this practice has not been followed. The agreementgranting privileges and immunities has already been ratified by Her Majesty&apos;s Gov-ernment without reservation, but no Order in Council has yet been made. such order would contain provisions only in respect of corporate personality and incometax relief, and administrative arrangements have been made temporarily to preventbreach of obligation.5. There are clearly very strong objections to Her Majesty&apos;s Governmentenjoying the membership of an international organisation without granting to itthe privileges and immunities which have been approved for it under international agreement, which have been granted by other countries and which are in some casesless than could have been held due under common international law, had no agree-ment been made. (Paragraph 14, Annex I). In my view the practical effect of whatis now proposed will be inconsiderable because:  (a) Compared with the amount of immunity and privilege already existing inLondon in respect of the Diplomatic Corps, the addition made by inter-national organisations is very small.(b) Except in the rare case of the organisation having its headquarters in theUnited Kingdom, and, except for certain branch offices such as therepresentative of the International Children&apos;s Emergency Fund and theUnited Nations Information Agency, the personal privileges and immunities will normally be enjoyed only by people visiting this countryfor brief periods and in small numbers.(c) There are at the present moment only two organisations which have their headquarters in this country. These are the Brussels Treaty Organisa-tion and the International Wheat Council. Privileges and immunitieshave already been granted to the former and the privileges and immunities of the latter, which have not yet been granted, are ofan extremely limited character and include no personal immunitywhatever. If the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government is now changed,it is probable that no international organisation would desire to establishitself in the United Kingdom.6.   For these reasons I recommend:  (i) That Her Majesty&apos;s Government should grant to the international organ-isations to which they belong the moderate privileges which are defined in their individual agreements.(ii) That a serious effort should be made by Ministers in both Houses to convince Parliament that criticism and dislike of Orders in Councilconferring privileges and immunities is not, in general, well founded.(iii) That the draft Orders listed in Annex 3 below should be presented toParliament in due course..&apos;  - M &apos;   &quot; ;        &apos;. .-A..E. )/ j &apos;- /&apos; / ;Foreign Office, S.W.

ANNEX II. The BackgroundA. Position up to the end of 19451. Before 1939 there were few international organisations (such as the Leagueof Nations, the International Labour Office, the Universal Postal Union and theInternational Telecommunication Union), but during and after the Second world war the creating of international organisations on a large scale began.2. The status of these new creations gave rise to a number of problems andat the Conferences at which these organisations were set up the United KingdomGovernment of the day decided, in company with most other Governments, thatthe privileges and immunities of these organisations should be fixed by international agreement. It was accepted that legislative action in respect of them would benecessary in the United Kingdom. Consequently the Diplomatic Privileges(Extension) Act, 1944, was passed, and between 1944 and 1946 a number of orders in Council were made under its provisions.B. 1945-1950.   Action in the United Nations and the United Kingdom3. The General Assembly of the United Nations in 1945-46 dealt with theimmunities and privileges of the United Nations. As a result, the General Con-vention on the Privileges and Immunities of the United Nations was drawn up.In addition, the General Assembly, largely at the instigation of the United kingdom delegation, passed a resolution providing for the unification of the privileges and immunities of all organisations, which were or which were to become specialised agencies of the United Nations. The object was to prevent such organisationsfrom obtaining excessive privileges and immunities and to ensure that those whichit was considered necessary to accord should be uniform in character,4. The General Convention on Privileges and Immunities of the united nations was found to require a new Act of Parliament amending the Act of 1944,and the Diplomatic Privileges (Extension) Act, 1946, was accordingly passed.Parliament also approved the conception of unification of the privileges and immunities of the Specialised Agencies. An undertaking was given by the thengovernment to the House of Commons that certain privileges which could be givento Specialised Agencies should not be given to other international organisationsunless the matter had been specially brought to the attention of Parliament.5. The General Assembly of the United Nations adopted at its second session in 1947 a &quot; Convention on the Privileges and Immunities of the specialised agencies of the United Nations.&quot; This provides a series of standard clauses anda series of annexes containing the modifications of these standard clauses for eachAgency, the Agency having the final say in the drafting of its own annex. Fortheir part, Governments bind themselves to give the specified privileges and immunities to a Specialised Agency on their accession to the Convention in respectof that Agency.6. Between 1946 and 1950 the Government of the day acceded to the Con-vention in respect of a number of Specialised Agencies, each accession requiring anOrder in Council to implement it. Under the 1946 Act a number of further orders in Council were made in this way and until 1950 gave rise to no difficulty. (A listof these Orders is given at Annex II.)C. Privileges and Immunities for the Council of Europe-19507. In 1950 an amendment to the Act of 1946 became necessary because themembers of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, although they represented their countries, did not represent their Governments. The amendingAct, as finally approved by Parliament, lays down that a draft of any Order inCouncil conferring immunities and privileges upon an international organisation shall be laid before Parliament, and that the draft shall not be submitted to her majesty except in pursuance of an address presented by each House of Parliamentpraying that the Order be made. This provision was repeated in the international organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950, which now consolidates thethree previous Acts.42396 B 2
d. The Universal Postal Union Order in Council July to October 19508. A draft Order in Council with regard to the privileges and immunities ofthe U.P.U. was placed before the House of Commons in July 1950. The necessaryaffirmative resolution was obtained despite opposition. This opposition wasrenewed in the House of Lords. The order was, therefore, withdrawn and inOctober 1950 a motion was adopted discharging the Order in the House ofCommons.9. In addition to general arguments against a further extension of the granting of privileges and immunities, the opposition was based on the ground that theU.P.U. had functioned without them satisfactorily for the last seventy-five years.10. An answer to this argument is that as we have already granted privileges and immunities to six Specialised Agencies, it would be inconsistent not to do soin the case of the others. In fact it seems unjust that the fact that the U.P.U. hasbeen carrying on efficient work in the past should bar it from receiving the privileges and immunities which we have granted to more recently founded organisations ofa similar character. Moreover, Her Majesty&apos;s Government have, up to now,considered it their duty to accede to the Specialised Agencies Convention in respectof all Specialised Agencies not otherwise provided for, because it would be improperfor Her Majesty&apos;s Government to enjoy the advantages of membership withoutgranting to these Agencies the privileges and immunities which have been approved for them.11. But since the U.P.U. is a Specialised Agency Her Majesty&apos;s government cannot accede to the Convention in respect of it unless and until an Order in councils made.II. Effect of Orders in council a. Comparatively small effect in the United Kingdom of most Orders12. Orders in Council conferring privileges and immunities on international organisations have in most cases little or no practical effect in the United Kingdom.It is only when the international organisation has its headquarters or carries out an important part of its activities in the United Kingdom that the Orders can have any appreciable effect.B. Provisions of Privileges and Immunities Orders in Council13. The main privileges and immunities which are granted to representatives and officials of international organisations when an Order in Council is made arebriefly as follows. (They are always well below the maximum which is fixed by theInternational Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act and indeed below whatby the common law of nations would be accorded to Delegates at international conferences held in the United Kingdom.   See paragraph .14 below):  (a) Representatives of Governments attending Meetings(i) Immunity from legal process in respect of words spoken or writtenor acts done in their capacity as representatives..(ii) During the period when they are attending meetings as representatives and the periods when they are travelling to meetings or going home from them, immunity from personal arrest or detention and fromseizure of personal baggage and inviolability of papers and documents.(.yi) During the period of meetings and the journeys to and from them,similar exemption from taxes as is accorded to an envoy of aforeign sovereign Power.(b) Officials of the Organisation. These fall into two classes:  (i) High officials who in fact have the same position in all respects exceptin regard to taxation as foreign Ambassadors.(ii) Other officials who only receive - \(a) Immunity from legal process in respect of their official acts;(b) Immunity from taxation on their official salaries.
14. Finally, by common international law, if an international conference ofGovernment representatives is held in this country with the consent of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment, full diplomatic privilege has, for the period of the conference, to be accorded to all the foreign representatives of the Governments attending it. Thisis recognised by Section 4 of the International Organisations (Privileges and immunities) Act, 1950, itself, under which when such a conference is held inLondon, power is given to the Foreign Secretary to issue lists of the persons attend-ing it who are entitled to diplomatic immunity during the conference.16. The diplomatic immunity of the high officials is of course open to criticism. The number of these is, however, very small because no international organisation, apart from the United Nations itself (which has ten) has been allowedto have more than one or two officials altogether in this category and of thesefew, if any, will be resident in the United Kingdom. (The North Atlantic Treatyagreement provides, however, for an unspecified number of very high officials;but these are likely to be three or four at the most in the foreseeable future.)17. There are good grounds for according the present exemption from taxa-tion on the salaries of officials of international organisations:  (i) If salaries were liable to taxation they would merely be raised by theOrganisation and Her Majesty&apos;s Governments contribution to theOrganisation would be correspondingly increased;(ii) Net emoluments of officials of equivalent grades could not be uniform,as is clearly desirable, if they were subject to different rates of taxationin different countries.ANNEX IIOrders in Council made under the Diplomatic Privileges (Extension) Act,1944, As amended by the Diplomatic Privileges (Extension) Act, 1946The Diplomatic Privileges (United Nations and International Court of Justice)Order in Council, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (International Labour Organisation) Order in Council,1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (International Civil Aviation Organisation) Order inCouncil, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (World Health Organisation) Order in Council, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (International Refugee Organisation) Order in Council,1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (Food and Agriculture Organisation) Order in Council,1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (United Nations Educational, Scientific and cultural organisation) Order in Council, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (International Refugee Organisation) Order in Council,No. 2, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (International Labour Organisation) (Amendment) Orderin Council, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (World Health Organisation and International CivilAviation Organisation) (Amendment) Order in Council, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (United Nations and International Court of Justice)(Amendment) Order in Coucil, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (Brussels Treaty Permanent Commission) (Amendment)Order in Council, 1949. //The Diplomatic Privileges (Organisation for European Economic Co-operation)Order in Council, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (Brussels Treaty Permanent Commission) (AmendmentNo. 2) Order in Council, 1949.The Diplomatic Privileges (General Amendment) Order in Council, 1950.
