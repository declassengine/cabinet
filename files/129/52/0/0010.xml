4fSECRETC. (52) 16013TH MAY, 1952RECORD GOCABINETFiChCOPY NOLEGISLATIVE programme memorandum by the Lord Privy SealWhen the Cabinet considered my earlier memorandum on thelegislative programme (C. (52) 139) at their meeting on 7th May (C. C, (52) 50thConclusions, Minute ^6), they invited me to examine the practicability of deferring the autumn resumption proposed in Alternative B of that memorandum byone week and of opening the 1953 Session oil or about 10th February.2. I have discussed this with the Secretary of State for Common&quot;wealth Relations.   It now seems likely that the Transport Bill may be somewhatshorter than was previously thought (perhaps 50 instead of 60 Claxises) and thatthe Committee Stage in the Commons might be completed in 8 instead of 9 days.In the light of this change and of the Cabinefs views we suggest the following programme for this Bill.Presentation in the House of CommonsPublicationSecond ReadingParliament will adjournThursday, 3rd JulyFriday, 4th JulyTuesday to Thursday,22nd to 24th July, orMonday to Wednesday,28th to 30th JulyFriday, 8th AugustParliament will reassemble Mondayj 13th OctoberTimetable Motion Wednesday, 15th OctoberCommittee StageReport StageThird ReadingFirst Reading in the House of LordsSecond ReadingMonday, Tuesday and Thursday.;20th, 21st and 23rd OctoberMonday, Tuesday and Thursday,27th, 28th and 30th OctoberMonday and Tuesday,3rd and 4th November.Thursday, Monday and Tuesday,13th, 17th and 18th November.Thursday, 20th November.Thursday, 20th NovemberMonday and Tuesday, 24thand 25th November

This programme may need modification as the Transport Bill progresses;but I invite my colleagues to approve it as a broad framework within which weshould work.   Its principal weakness is the shortness of the intervals in bothHouses between Committee Stage and Report Stage.   If the Bill should be readyearlier than we expect, it could be taken earlier, but I think it would be unwise to assume this for planning purposes or to endeavour to save time for the later stages by reducing the interval between publication and Second Reading whichthis programme allows.   I understand that the arrangement whereby the Houseof Lords would remain in Session until 22nd December to take the Third reading of the Bill will be more acceptable to them than one under which they wouldreassemble a week earlier than the House of Commons after the christmas recess.4. To begin the 1953 Session in February will undoubtedly cause some difficulty.   I must emphasise that a great deal of the early part of the Session willbe devoted to the business of supply and other urgent matters.   I therefore recommend that v/e should aim to begin the Session on 3rd February and not on the10th February as has been suggested.   Excluding Private Members1 time, which i assume will be allowed to continue, I estimate that there will be 37 Parliamentarydays, including two Fridays, between the 3rd February and Easter (33 if the Sessionbegan on 10th February).   Six of these may be required for the debate on the Addresand ten for supply;  one will be needed for a Defence debate, one for the EasterAdjournment and, allowing four for contingencies, only 15 days will be availablefor legislation.   If the Session began on 10th February, only 11 days would be ,available for legislation before Easter.   Between Easter and Whitsun only 11 daysfurther will be available for legislation.   The Whitsun Recess will have to be longer than usual because of the Coronation and, after taking account of the time needed forthe Finance Bill and the business of supply, possibly not more than two days will beavailable for other legislation between Whitsun and the Summer Recess.
5. I should warn my colleagues that this means, even if the Iron andSteel Bill is introduced immediately the Session opens, that if Committee Stageis taken on the floor of the House the Bill will not leave the House ofCommons until Whitsun and cannot be enacted until July.   There will be practically no opportunity to enact any other legislation in the Session.I suggest, therefore, that a Future Legislation Committee should be set up assoon as possible in order to decide what measures must be passed in the 1953Session and plan the work of that Session accordingly.H.C.Office of the Lord Privy Seal, S. W. 1.,13TH MAY, 1952.
