(52) 17323rd May, 1952CABINETTHE BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND THE METAL-USINGINDUSTRIESMemorandum by the Chancellor of the ExchequerIntroductoryI have discussed the balance of payments outlook in C. (52) 172 and indicatedtherein that an increase of at least 20 per cent, in our total exports over the next three years is needed if we are to pay for our current requirements of importedfood and raw materials, meet Government overseas expenditure and make provision on a minimum acceptable basis for dealing with our external capital position.This export task can only be achieved with a very substantial increase in our exportsof engineering products. My aim in this paper is to examine this export task inmore detail, and to discuss some of the modifications in other policies that maybe needed to enable this task to be fulfilled. It is clear to me that these modificationswill have to include some lightening of the defence load on the engineering industries.The Size of the Export Task2. The Import Bill. We have already taken decisions to reduce our expendi-ture on imports. A substantial reduction below 1951 levels has been made in theimport programme for this year. Some of the savings were possible because imports in 1951 were greater than was required for current consumption and expenditurein 1952 could be saved by foregoing further increases of stock. A substantial partof the savings is to be attributed, however, to a reduction in imports for eonsump-tion of food, As I see it, the minimum total import programme which we would find tolerable in the next three years would cost us the following amounts:  .3. This level of imports may be considered to be too austere. It implies thatfood imports will remain throughout the period at the reduced level programmedfor 1952. Raw material imports would be just enough to allow for probableincreases in output. No allowance has been made for any increased &quot; liberalisa-tion &quot; of our imports from Europe. I have adopted these figures, however, in order not to exaggerate the size of our export problem. If my colleagues consider thatlarger imports will be necessary, the metal goods problem discussed below will bemade correspondingly more difficult.4. To secure overseas earnings sufficient to cover an import bill of at least this magnitude, to make some provision for our overseas capital commitments, to cover the foreign exchange cost of our troops in Germany, and to do these things withoutcourting disaster unless we receive substantial general economic aid from the United-42306 B  millionActual imports (at March 1952prices)    :.....19513,50019533,20019543,30019553,350.
States after 1953, is of course a tremendous task. I estimate that it will require anincrease in visible exports of the following dimensions:    MillionExports required (at March 1952      1951       1953      1954      1955prices; actual in 1951)        ...      2,710      3,060-    3,300      3,320, 5. This is a very large increase in exports. It becomes even more formidablewhen looked at in terms of the market prospects for different types of goods andthe importance of obtaining most of the increase in non-sterling markets.6.   United Kingdom exports can be grouped into three broad categories :  , (i) Raw materials (including coal and steel), and the products of the petroleum:,: and chemical industries.(ii) Manufactured consumer goods (other than those of metal) including food,drink and tobacco products, and the products of the textiles, clothing,leather, furniture, paper and similar industries.(iii) Metal products including engineering goods, durable consumer goods,motor vehicles, plant and machinery, ships and aircraft.7. The market prospects for these products differ very greatly. Demandfor the &quot; raw materials &quot; group is not being satisfied and it would appear thatsubstantially more exports of this kind could be sold if they could be madeavailable. Obviously, however, we cannot count upon greatly increased exportsof many of the items in this group although we must do everything we can toincrease exports of coal and coke. Very different considerations apply to thenon-metal consumer goods exports, which accounted for about one-third of our total exports in 1951. Export receipts from this class of goods appears likely toremain below 1951 levels for the next few years. Clearly, therefore, most of theincrease in exports required over the next few years will have to be achieved byexports of metal goods. As I see it our prospects of achieving our balance ofpayments tasks wil be poor unless we can make available for export about  400million worth of metal goods more in 1953 than we exported in 195.1. In 1954the task will be even greater and would call for some  550 million more metal goods exports than in 1951. There are two important problems to consider:(a) can these exports be sold in the right markets and (b) can they be madeavailable.8. Most of this increase in exports of metal products has got to go to non-sterling destinations, since in 1951 we were running a non-sterling deficit of 760 million. Our surplus last year with the Sterling Area is about the magnitudewe shall have to maintain. This means that we have got to achieve this largeexpansion of exports in markets which are by no means easy for United kingdom manufacturers. The required expansion in the volume of metal goods exportsto the non-sterling markets between 1951 and 1953 is of the order of 50 per cent.,with a further 20&quot; per cent, expansion between 1953 and 1954.9. Clearly there can be no guarantee that the total increase required in metal goods exports to the non-sterling world can be achieved. It is, however, abundantly clear that we must continue to rely heavily on the metal goods industries for the major share of the export task no other sector of our export trade has anything like the &quot; sellers&apos; market &quot; prospects that we hope will continue for a considerablerange of engineering products over the next few years.&apos;v; 10. How difficult our task will be depends in part on the general growth of world demand for these goods. But it also depends on our ability to secure anincreased share in this trade from other competitors. In 1951 our total share of world trade in metal products fell. One of the obstacles to the capture by theUnited Kingdom of a large share of the world markets at present is the longdelivery dates which United Kingdom manufacturers have to quote because of the congestion of their order books. One way of helping to make British metal goodsmore competitive is to reduce the load on British industry. These exports will notbe made if the resources which could make them are earmarked for other things;If they are not made we shall find all too soon that we are unable to pay for the raw materials our industries.need; the total supplies of metal goods for all purposeswould then inevitably be less. In this sense unless the export claim, can be met infull all other claims are at risk.
11. Sup plies. -Much of the increase in the output of metal goods which was achieved last year appears to have been made possible only by running down stocksof steel and work in progress. As a result, difficulties over steel supplies are beingfelt particularly acutely this year, and this is likely to affect the rate of expansionof output next year as well as this. Moreover, we cannot be confident that evenby 1953 steel supplies will be sufficient to meet full requirements, even with importsof the order of l-j million tons, because raw material difficulties (especially scrap,coke) are holding back United Kingdom steel output. This paper assumes thatsteel requirements will be met in full after 1953 and sufficient imports of steel andiron ore are allowed for in the import programme. The rate at which output ofthe metal-using industries could expand with ample steel supplies clearly depends on the pattern of the demand the output is being expanded to meet. For somegoods where overseas demand is likely to be strong additional capacity will have tobe created before output can expand to any considerable extent. I have assumed,however, that by 1954 and 1955 output will be expanding at about the same rate as in 1950, namely, 8 per cent, per annum, and that it will be building up to thatrate of expansion in 1953 from the much lower rate that now appears inevitable in 1952.12. On the basis of these rates of expansion we could assess the likely increasein total metal-using output as of the order of  375 million between 1951 and 1953,and about a further  300 million between .1953 and 1954. Part of this increase would take the form of spare parts, supplies of industrial goods for other industries and similar types of goods which cannot be assigned at will to different uses. Theincrease in supplies is on any reckoning insufficient to cover both the full increasein exports required and the rapidly growing requirements of the present defence programme.13. Could the output of the metal-using industries be increased more rapidly than this in the kinds of output we want? Even in 1953 these industries appearunlikely to get all the steel they could use. None the less I doubt whether eventhe removal of all their difficulties over steel could add more than about  50 million to the output I have assumed for that year, on the condition that the increase hasto be exported. While the shortage of steel persists any extra steel for them wouldhave to be at the expense of some other use. The only important use outside the metal-using industries which could be reduced without effect on defence or on thebalance of payments is in the field of social investment. If the amount of steel goingto schools, houses, hospitals, &amp;c, were reduced below the levels implied in the investment programme for this year, and the steel thus saved allocated to the metal-using industries, their output would rise more rapidly than indicated here thoughthe effects might not be immediate. This possibility, however, raises a number ofimportant issues of general policy.14. Home Uses other than Defence. Can room be found for both exports and defence by reducing the other home uses of metal goods, which (apart fromthe repair work and industrial goods mentioned above) are home civil investment,passenger cars and consumer goods?15. Home Civil Investment. Current plans for reducing the load on the metal goods industries envisage a substantial reduction in home investment in plant and machinery. This is to be brought about largely through the withdrawal of the initial depreciation allowances and the raising of export targets for capital goods,vehicles and agricultural machinery. It is quite clear, however, that in order to beable to achieve the export tasks, British industry will have to be able to meet therequirements of the overseas customer and do so at competitive prices. This willrequire increased investment in many branches of manufacturing industry. Invest-ment in manufacturing industry has probably never been sufficiently high inthe United Kingdom since 1914 to give us a sound competitive position. It isdifficult to say how high it should be or how high it could go if unrestricted^ but.we should at least restore it to the highest level we have been able to achievesince the war, namely, that of 1950. Moreover, investment in the basic industries will have to rise if we are not going to hamper industrial efficiency by power cutsand transport bottlenecks. Even a minimum programme of industrial investmentwill, therefore, call for an increase in home investment in plant and machinery of2 to 3 per cent, per annum. Indeed, it is arguable that this is too small a provision to contemplate if we are not to prejudice our future industrial output.42306 B 2
&quot;-&quot; 16.. Passenger Cars.-Deliveries of passenger cars have been severely restrictedfor many years and the restrictions announced on motor vehicles for the home market are already so severe that it is questionable whether in practice it will bepossible to maintain this low level. It may be more realistic to contemplate a slightprogressive relaxation in these restrictions.17. Consumer Goods.-Measures have already been taken to reduce theoutput of metal consumer goods to the home market by a substantial amount. Ithink that these restrictions should be maintained as long as the defence programmelasts, but I recognise that they will involve a fall in the output of and loss of labour by those firms which are unable to find export markets.18. But if it is accepted that large cuts cannot be made in home civil require-ments, it is clear that the metal-using industries cannot meet all the demands whichare being placed upon them. The requirements which are changing rapidly arethose of defence arid of the balance of payments. The balance of payments objec-tive cannot be met if the demands of defence on the engineering industries continueto increase as rapidly as at present contemplated.i 19.   The following table illustrates the broad magnitude of the problem.Supplies of Metal Goods and Claims upon them million at March 1952 pricesProduction plus imports......Required for repair work, spare parts, industrial supplies, &amp;c. ...1951	1952			(actual)	(forecast)	1953	1954	19553,725	3,900	4,100	4,400	4,750865	880	900	930	1,0402,860	3,020	3,200	3,470	3,7101,075		1,110	1,140	1,15070	 	60	60	70285	 	210	210	2101,430	-	1,820	2,060	2,280300	500	&apos;   600	. 650	1,130	 	1,220	1,410	1,130	 -	1,460	1,630	1,630Home civil uses -Investment (excluding passengercars)       ...      .........Passenger cars      ......-    Consumer goods   ......,i -   . Available for exports and defence ...Present requirements for defence(including civil defence and infra-structure) ..........Therefore, available for export   ...Export requirements as now seen ...In 1952 we have a defence programme which is expected to absorb more than thewhole of the disposable increment in supplies of metal goods. We are, therefore,having to reduce all home demands, including industrial investment, in order topermit any increase in exports at all. Our export tasks require, however, that nearly all the increment in supplies of metal goods should go to export. In 1953and later years the export task is so great that it will not be possible to achieve it ifindustrial investment is kept down. But if this is so and if defence productioncontinues its momentum, it will be impossible to make sufficient exports availableto meet the balance of payments task. The shortfall might be of the order of 220- 240 million. This suggests that in the light of our changed economic circum-stances the load which our defence commitments are putting on the metal-using industries is too.large for us to bear unless we are prepared to make very serioussacrifices in our standard of living.20. What are the practical possibilities of easing the metal goods problem?Broadly speaking we might do any of the following things: -(a) Import less.(b) Export more of other goods.(c) Sit back and hope that other people will help us.(d) Sit back and hope that the problem willl ease itself because prices, &amp;c, may go in our favour.; (e) Reduce our external payments on capital account.(/) Reduce Government overseas expenditure; including defence.
In view of the serious political and military consequences of reducing thedefence production programme, I think that we should consider the nature of these possibilities.21. (a) Importing less.-The import programme which has been included inthis assessment is already very austere.. It is difficult to reduce imports of rawmaterials if we are to keep our people employed; and a programme of food imports which, even after allowing for a substantial improvement on home agricul-tural output, still leaves total food consumption somewhat below the level of lastyear clearly provides little room for substantial cuts. If, nevertheless, we come tothe conclusion that we must make further savings in this field, we must give a clear indication of what further reductions in imports we think would be tolerable, and decide on the measures needed to bring these reductions about.22. (b) Exporting more. Here there is one thing we ought to do on its own merits, namely, to make more coal available for export. A substantial increase in coal exports would materially improve our bargaining position and have an im-portant psychological effect as well as bringing in extra revenue. But even if wecould increase exports in this period by about 10 million tons per annum, we should still only have about  50 million extra exports per annum. As to exports otherthan the products of the metal-using industries and coal, with the exception of someraw materials which we are having to import to meet our own requirements(e.g., steel), the problem is more one of selling than of making them available forexport. The present troubles of many of our exporting industries, e.g., textiles,indicate how unsafe it is to rely on selling more consumer goods; some increase insuch exports over expected levels in 1952 has already been assumed.23. (c) External Assistance. We may receive some United States aid after1953, but the last two years have shown the extreme dangers of undertakingcommitments which drive us to rely on external aid, which in the event is alwaystoo little and too late.  Our reserves are far too low to carry the risk any further.24. (d) External Conditions. Much of the analysis in this paper is based onassumptions, e.g., that the terms of trade remain as now. It is possible that theterms of trade will go in our favour and thereby reduce the export task. But itseems to me, if anything, more likely that they will go against us. When it isremembered that a swing of 5 per cent, in the terms of trade against us is equivalentlo  160 million on the balance of payments, it will be seen how quickly the reservescould run away if things went wrong. I do not consider, therefore, that we wouldbe justified in assuming the problem away by hoping that events will be kind to us.25. (e) Reducing our External Payments on Capital Account. In order toreduce the burden of our external payments on capital account, it would benecessary to make major changes in our external financial arrangements both withother sterling area countries of the Commonwealth and with foreign countries.It would not be easy or quick to do this by agreement. Furthermore, in certain cases a slowing down of our payments might imply a reduced rate of economic develop-ment in the Commonwealth which could have extensive repercussions on our balance of payments.26. (/) Overseas Government Expenditure. Much of this is military expendi-ture, which is in four main areas: Germany, Korea, the Middle East and Malaya.It is not for me to discuss the military and political problems involved in reducingsuch expenditures and we must await the results of the review which has, now been initiated.27. I do not rule out the possibility of some adjustments of the kind listed in paragraph 20 which would reduce to some extent the magnitude of the metal goods problem. We must, however, ensure that our choice is a consistent one andthat we give sufficient instructions to produce a comprehensive economic policywhich provides for the putting right of our balance of payments problem. Thiswill take time and while we are considering these issues we must take steps toensure that our decision is not compromised by the placing of further defence production orders.28. Defence. The defence programme to which the country is at presentcommitted is, however, a rising one and the total burden imposed on the metal-using industries by. defence production requirements- of all kinds (including civil
defence, infrastructure, works stores, &amp;c.) is expected to be of the order of  600 mil-lion at present prices in 1953 and of  650 million in 1954. Contracts which commit the resources of the engineering industry to the production of defence goods in1953 and 1954 are from the nature of things having to be made every day. As wemay have to decide to reduce the defence production programme in order to freeresources for export, we must at least ensure now that the amount of resources which will be irrecoverable for other purposes does not increase further.29. If we assume for the moment that we do not accept any of the possibilitiesof easing the metal-goods problem set out in paragraph 20 above, the maximum amount of metal-goods production which could be devoted to defence production,Consistent with the export objective, in 1953 and 1954, would be less than  400million in 1953 and not much more than  400 million in 1954 at the prices nowruling. The metal goods content of the defence production programme is alreadyrunning at about  500 million per annum and is expected to rise by over 100 million by 1954. It is clear that a reduction of this magnitude in the defence production programme not only has major consequences from the defence point ofview, but could not be brought about quickly without a measure of dislocationand waste. It might also react on the receipt by us of United States economic aid for 1952-53, thus increasing the size of the export task in 1953; and on the flow ofmilitary aid from the United States to the United Kingdom in 1952-53 and follow-ing years.30. In my view, however, whatever assessment we make of the possibilities in paragraph 20 above, we are likely to find it necessary to reduce the (defence load on the metal-using industries by a substantial amount. I consider, therefore, thatno fresh defence contracts with these industries for military production and civil defence should be let until we have completed our review of relevant economic policy. We should aim to complete this review as soon as possible, since if thereis to be a substantial reduction in the total size of the programme it is desirablethat the production programme should be got into balance as soon as possible.31. In conclusion, I must emphasise that the balance of payments surplus of 300 million a year upon which my analysis is based, does not take anything,approaching full account of the possible contingencies to which we may be sub-jected on our external accounts. Likewise, we have assumed an import expenditure which is very low, both in relation to consumption standards in this country andin relation to commercial policy needs. From the economic point of view, indeed,the analysis contains no margins of safety whatever, and in fact it might very wellbe argued that a substantial margin in addition ought to be provided for contingencies.32. Summary and Conclusions(a) To put right our balance of payments a substantial increase in our exportsof the order of  600 million, compared with 1951, will be necessary overthe next three years.ib) Most of the increase in exports will have to be metal goods, as some cate-gories of exports must be expected to be less than in 1951; but intensivemeasures must be adopted to promote all other exports, especially those products such as coal and coke which are still in great demand. Thenecessary priority should be given in raw material allocation and other-wise to permit the quickest possible expansion of exports.(c) Home demands on both civil and military metal goods must not be so highthat they frustrate this increase. Home investment, however, must be,; adequate for industrial efficiency, and should be allowed to increasebeyond the levels intended for 1952. Restrictions on domestic suppliesof durable consumer goods and motor cars will probably need to beretained for at least three years, but it may well be difficult to keep them as low as in 1952.id) Even so the programme for defence production(including civil defence). appears to me to be too high in our changed circumstances, and i recommend that we should consider ways and means of readjusting it.In reviewing the size of the defence programme, the possible course of overseas defence expenditures should be taken fully into account.Present indications are that a major contribution from a reduction in thedefence production programme will be necessary if we are to have any chance of avoiding balance of payments crises.
STATISTICAL APPENDIX1. The following tables illustrate the main magnitude involved in the discus-sion of the balance of payments problem.2. The Import Bill. The table below shows how the total import bill might change if imports of food and agricultural products were kept&apos; at a level littledifferent from the 1952 programmed level for the next three years. Imports of rawmaterials and oil are assumed to increase with industrial output and are consistentin particular with the increase in the output of the metal-using industries discussed later. Within the miscellaneous category &quot; all other imports &quot; imports of machine tools, &amp;c, for defence are assumed to become insignificant after 1952 and importsof machinery and of manufactured goods are assumed to remain unchanged at therate of import programmed for the second half of 1952. No allowance has beenmade for the cost of any additional imports which would come in if the UnitedKingdom restored any open general licences for imports from Europe.Table 1 -The Total Import Bill, 1951 and 1953 to 1955Imports consumed Food and agricultureRaw materialsOil    ...      ......      ...      ...All other imports   ...  million	f.o.b:	at March 1952	prices1951	1953	1954	19551,300	1,140	1,140	1,1401,480	1,610	1,700	1,750180	180	180	190370	270	260	2703,330	3,200	3,280	3,3503. Allowing for the cost of imports which went into stock in 1951 and costing1951 imports at the actual prices in that year, we find that the total import bill would be about  300 million less in 1953 than in 1951 but by 1955 the total savingwould have fallen to about  150 million.Table 2  million^-)1951        1953        1954 1955Actual imports .........      3,500       3,200        3,280        3,350(x) At March 1952 prices, except for 1951 which is at actual prices ruling in 1951.4.

5. The Export Task for Metal Goods. It appears probable that most of theincrease in exports required over the next few years will have to be achieved by increased exports of metal goods. The task falling on them can be illustrated as.follows:  Table 4 &apos;The Export Task of Metal GoodsExports required on balance of pay-ments basis......Exports required on trade accountbasisC1)        ..,      ...      ...   &apos;  ...Raw   materials;   food,   drink   and tobacco; chemical and petroleum products      ...      ...      ......Consumer goods (other than of metal)Re-exportsRequired from metal goods exports(2)(*) A standard correction of .40 million per annum has been applied to allow for differences in definition between balance of payments and trade account tables, in order to cover such adjustments as the exclusion of diamonds from the trade account figures. The actual figuresfor 1951 also reflect the difference between the value of goods exported in the year and theamount of payment received in the year. Differences of this kind are too irregular to be-carried forward into the other figures.(2) This table covers a slightly narrower range of products than are included in the tableon the supply of metal goods in the paper to which this is an appendix. The exports inthis table are valued at f.o.b. prices, whereas in the other table they are valued at ex-factoryprices. These figures differ from the export figures in the metal goods table for the years1953, .1954 and 1955 by 41 per cent. . For the year 1951 they differ by 41 per cent, plus afurther 8 per cent, for the difference between average 1951 and March 1952 prices.6. It will be seen that in 1953 exports of metal goods are required to earnabout  400 million, more than in 1951, and in 1954 about  550 million more. Asprices have already increased since 1951, the increase in the volume of metal goodsexports required could be less than this, namely about  330 million more in 1953than in 1951, and about  500 million more in 1954 than in 1951.
