f,56th MAY, 1952.CABINETCONTRACTUAL SETTLEMENT WITHTHE GERMAN FEDERAL REPUBLIC.WAR criminals memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.Recent developments in Germany make it necessary to amend the contract on German war criminals, which forms part of the Acts and Interests Con&quot;vention of the contractual settlement (see Section D of Annex I to C. (52)144.   the contract, which was agreed when the German Federal Chancellor was in london in February, provided that the German Federal Republic would accept the custody of the war criminals in Federal territory.   On 14thFebruary the Cabinet(C.C.(52) 17th Conclusions, Minute 5) &quot;reaffirmed their support for the handing over to German custody of war criminals in thethree Allied Zones&quot;.2.        The Federal Government now hold that if, after the entry into forceof such a Convention, a war criminal were to apply to the German Courts,German judges would almost certainly be bound, in the state of the federal republic&apos;s Basic Law, to order the petitioner^ release.   In that case, theFederal Government as the detaining authority, would have to comply.   It there-fore seems that we are bound to keep responsibility for custody in our own hands.3.        Accordingly, the  allied representatives in Germany, in consultationwith German representatives, have redrafted the contract,   (see Annex A).I consider it acceptable.   It provides for the continuance by the Three Powersof their responsibility for the custody of war criminals.   In paragraphs 4 and 5,the draft provides for an eventual handing over of custody to the federal republic.   In fact, it seems unlikely that, in view of the constitutional difficulties   (a two-thirds majority is required in the German Parliamentto amend the Basic Law), such a transfer of responsibility will ever be possible.But, in agreement with the   Germans, we a^e providing for this possibletransfer of responsibility and incidentally representing the continuance ofour own responsibility as transitory.   This should make the new arrangementmore attractive to public opinion, especially in Germany.if4.        Apart from the point of custody, the main lines of the contract remain as agreed last February.   In particular, the arrangement for clemency remains.It will be exercised by the convicting Power on the recommendation of a mixed Board consisting of one representative of each of the Three AlliedPowers and three German representatives.   A unanimous recommendation willbe binding on the convicting Power.CONFIDENTIAL CABINET OFFICE:RECORD COPY -C.(52) 151 COPY NO. / U
5.        The new provisions in the War Criminals Contract necessitate aslight addition to the Convention on General Relations.   This is requiredbecause the continuance of our responsibility for the custody of war criminals after the conclusion of the contract must derive from oursupreme authority.   It is therefore proposed to insert into theAgreement on General Relations the passage attached as Annex B.This draft speaks of a &quot;transitional period&quot;.   As such, it should not meet with objection.   The Article of the Agreement on General Relations,which defines the extent of the supreme authority which the Three powers will retain, thus remains unaltered.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1,6th MAY, 1952.
annex AArticle 6 of the General Provisions of the convention on Acts and Interests1. There is hereby established a Mixed Board (referred toin this Article as &quot;the Board&quot;).
