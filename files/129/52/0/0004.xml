south american meat negotiations memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer my colleagues agreed that expenditure on meat from Argentina andUruguay should, subject to review later in the year in the light of the balanceof payments position, be limited to  25 millions plus the value of possible economies in other imports which might amount to  6 millions(C.C.(52) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 7).   It has been possible by reason ofother economies to raise the figure of  25 millions to  30 millions.   Itwas also decided that there should be no purchases of canned corned meat for the stockpile (Co. (52) 26th Conclusions, Minute 6).2, Negotiations in Argentina and Uruguay have now opened.   TheArgentine Government have offered us 200,000 tons of carcase meat at 192 per ton (compared with  126 per ton paid in 1951/52) and 30,000 tonsof canned corned meat for which they have not mentioned a price.   TheUruguay Government are not prepared to mention quantities or prices;they say that the quantity will depend on our price,3, It is now necessary for our Ambassador to reply to the argentine government and he will shortly have to make some advance on the presentprice of  126 per ton.   We have notionally divided the  30 millions into 24 millions for Argentina and  6 millions for Uruguay. As soon as the ambassador advances the price beyond  126 per ton he will have reached apoint at which he cannoi; afford within the ceiling to buy 200,000 tons of meat and he must, without disclosing that he is working to a monetary ceiling,make it clear that he will not be buying the full quantity of meat offered.4. There is nothing in the balance of payments position which should moveme from the view that we must limit our purchases of South American meat tothe  30 millions proposed,   I do, however, think that we must now reach conclusions on quantities in order that the Ambassador in Buenos Aires maysay how much meat he will buy.   I recognise that by doing this in advance of having a firmer idea of price there is some risk that the total sum earmarkedmay be slightly exceeded.   I am prepared to take this risk subject of course to my right to say that any particular price asked by Argentina is an excessiveprice to pay for any meat at all and I therefore recommend that we should decide now to buy 200,000 tons of carcase meat in South America of which160,000 tons in Argentina and 40,000 tons in Uruguay,   I believe that we must nowdecide on a figure which will be final,   W-e do not want a repetition of lastyear&apos;s unhappy negotiations and we must not therefore be indecisive.5. I recognise that there will be criticism both here and in South Americawhen it is found we are not prepared to buy all the meat offered.   This,however, is an inevitable feature of our balance of payments and was a riskwhich we faced when we decided that we must limit purchases to  30 millions,6, I would propose, however, that we should instruct the ambassador in Argentina to say at a suitable time that we are prepared to buy carcase meatin excess of 160,000 tons or canned corned meat to the extent that Argentina-1-it\ secret (52) 154 CABINET OFFICb copy no. i^lRECORD COPY9th may, 1952cabinet
buys extra less essential Argentine imports (including textiles) from us.   We would have to link these supplementary purchases not only withthe issue of import licences but with actual Argentine purchases here,7. I consider that unless Uruguay approaches us again we should nowleave the negotiations there in abeyance until we have more idea whesewe are getting in Argentina but that eventually they should follow the samepattern as Argentina,   I understand that there   are reports of increasing pressure on the Government to send meat to us, if necessary at last year&apos;sprice provisionally;  I would accept such a proposal if it were made.   Itmay not be necessary or even desirable to have the same arrangement forlinking additional purchases with their purchases of our less essentials;this would be for consideration later on.8. I therefore recommend to my colleagues that -(a) We should endorse our decision to limit our purchases of south american meat for balance of payments reasons and authorise our negotiators to buy 160,000 tons of carcase meat in Argentina and40,000 tons in Uruguay.(b) Our negotiators should be authorised to make some modest advance on last year&apos;s price (say 10%) and that the Minister of Food and Ishould be authorised to agree to further advances as necessary,.     reporting back to our colleagues when we think the time has come,(c) At a suitable moment we should tell the Argentine authorities that we will be prepared to buy additional quantities of carcase meator some canned corned meat to the extent that they buy extra less essential imports from this country.(d) The negotiations in Uruguay should be left to develop in the light of progress made in the major deal.Re A. B0Treasury Chambers, S. W. 1. ,9TH MAY, 1952.
