secret.(52) 15.312th MAY, 1952.CABINET OFFICtRECORD COPYCABINETCOPY NO.MEAT SUPPLIESNote by the Lord President of the Council.I have read theChancellor of theExchequer&apos; s paper (C.(52) 154)and feel bound to record my deep concern about the meat situation.The meat ration is now so low that I believe the butchers are havingdifficulty in cutting it up:   the public certainly is.Pre-war consumption of meat was about 99 lbs. per person per year.In 1951 it was 60 lbs. - lower than it has ever been either pre-war or   post-war.The ration is now l/2d. a week of butchers meat which represents little morethan j lb. per person for domestic   consumption.We cannot expect the public to be satisfied with our administrationif we keep the meat ration at this low level when there is meat in the world forus to buy.I fully recognise the importance of the balance of payments but myopinion is that we ought to buy all the meat we can get both in the Argentine andin Uruguay.    The extra drain on the balance of payments would probably notbe more than  15 millions at the worst.   There may be compensations:   if wedo not trade with these people they cannot trade with us.   By extending our purchases as I suggest we may indeed succeed in encouraging such an exchangeof trade that the drain on our balance of payments would not be so much as thefigure I have mentioned.Be that as it may, I am certain that our duty is to get a reasonablediet for the people of this country and l/2d. worth of meat a week does not give it.W.Privy Council Office, S.W.1.12th MAY, 1952.IjIt
