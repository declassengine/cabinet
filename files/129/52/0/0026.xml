OFFKRECORD copy copy NO,26TH MAY, 1952CABINETCIVIL AIR TRANSPORTNote by the Secretary of the CabinetI attach the draft of a statement on Civil Air transport to be made in both Houses on Tuesday, 27th May.   ThePrime Minister has directed that it should be considered bythe Cabinet to-morrow.(Signed)  NORMAN brook cabinet Office, S. W. 1.,26TH MAY, 1952.
DRAFT STATEMENT ON CIVIL AIR TRANSPORT FORTUESDAY, 27TH MAY, 1952My Noble Friend, Lord Leathers, has already stated in anotherplace that it is the policy of Her Majesty&apos;s Government for air transport to combine the activities of the Airways Corporations and the independentcompanies in the way which will best serve the interests of british civil Aviation and of all users of their services.We recognise that the Airways Corporations have established themselves well in the international field.   We shall do all we can toencourage this.   They are up against intensive competition from foreign airlines and we are determined that the competitive strengthof the Corporations to operate both first and second or tourist classservices on their present established networks will not be impaired.On the other hand, we seek to improve the position of the inde-pendent companies, who with few exceptions lack long term security and opportunities of expansion.   They cannot establish their position ifthey cannot plan firmly ahead.   We therefore intend to give the inde-pendent companies more scope and more security, while at the sametime not increasing the cost of civil aviation to the taxpayer.We have therefore decided that the development of new overseasscheduled services shall be open to the Corporations and independentcompanies alike.   Applications will be made to the Air Transport AdvisoryCouncil, who will administer a procedure on licensing lines.   AssociateAgreements for new routes will normally be granted for seven-yearperiods with extension to 10 years in special cases.   This should giveprivate firms sufficient security for capital outlay and expansion.   Inparticular, we have hopes of independent companies developing the all-freight market, which is a growing field with great possibilities.   Thereilare also opportunities for special types of service such as seasonalinclusive tours and services at cheap fares not directly competitive
with B.O. A. C. to places within the Colonial Empire.Charter operations are in the main the domain of theindependent operator.   The Corporations will keep the right to engage in charter work in those cases where they have special facilities.They will not, however, maintain aircraft specifically for charterwork.     United Kingdom internal services present a special problem.Their cost to the tax-payer is considerable.   We are still examining thebest way of relieving the tax-payer of this burden so far as possible,while at the same time meeting the needs of, for example, Scotland,the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man.   In the meantime B.E.A. willcontinue to operate the r existing network.   Internal services additional to those of B.E.A. will be made available to private operators for long-term periods.   The Air Transport Advisory Council will be ready toreceive during this summer applications for these and for overseas services in time for the policy to take effect in 1953.   The companies willcontinue to operate scheduled services as Associates of the Corporationsbut under a modified form of Agreement and without subsidy.   terms and conditions of service must comply with agreements reachedthrough the machinery of the National Joint Council for Civil air transport.Under this policy, which has been framed after consultationwith the many interests affected, the public and private sectors of theindustry can both make their best contributions to the development ofBritish civil aviation.-2-
