secret CABINET 0 F FIC&apos;c.(52) 153 RECORD COPY copy no. h&amp;9th may, 1952cabinetINCREASE IN MEAT prices memorandum by the Minister of food the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his Budget statement that meat prices would be increased by an average of 4d. per lb.   I have agreed with the Lord President and the Chancellor that this increase should come intoeffect on 15th June.   The previous increase was by an average of 3d, per lb.on 22nd July, 1951.2. An average increase of 4d. per lb. on all meat and offal necessarilyinvolves increases higher than the average figure on particular types andcuts since there are certain items, such as bones and trimmings which account for some 15 per cent to 20 per cent of the carcase, on which very little, if any,increase in price can be made.3, In drawing up the new schedules of meat prices which will operate fromthe 15th June we have endeavoured to spread the increases in such a way as tomaintain, as far as possible, the normal relationship which the Trade regard as necessary between one type of cut and another.   My colleagues will wishto be informed of the main changes proposed and a list of typical increasesis attached as an appendix.4, Manufacturing meat prices will also have to be raised from 15th June.The price of manufacturing pork will be increased by 4^d. per lb. , of beef by ;fdo per lb. , and of veal by 4d. per lb.   No increase will be made in the priceof manufacturing mutton which is unpopular with manufacturers.5, Prices of all meat products will have to be increased by amountsvarying with the type and proportion of meat they contain.   The most importantitems from the point of view of the housewife, and the only items which enterinto the Retail Prices Index, are beef and pork sausages, which it is estimatedwill rise from Is. 6pi. to ls,10^d. and from 2s. 2d. to 2s. 7^d. per lb.respectively, after taking into account recent increases in costs of otheringredients.6. The new prices tend to narrow the gap which normally exists betweenthe prices of beef and pork sausages and to that extent would not be regarded by the trade as giving the correct relationship one to the other, but the lord president and I think that the increases proposed will give the best compromisein all the circumstances.I7, The total effect on the Retail Prices Index of all these increased prices will be a rise of 1. 75 points. /&apos;/
8, Our meat stocks have been slowly building up over the last fewmonths and we should be able not only to carry the present rationthrough the month of June, which is the worst period from the point ofview of home killed supplies, but to give a modest increase in the rationas from the date on which the new prices come into effect.9. A ration of Is, 2d, at present prices will become approximatelyIs, 5d, at new prices.   I have agreed with the Lord President that weshould propose to raise the ration to Is. 7d. with effect from the 15th June,We should have no difficulty in carrying this on until home killed suppliesbegin to come forward in quantity in August.G.
