CABINET OFFICE:&quot; RECORD COPY(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)SECRET . f&apos;&quot;jCOPY NO.      /C. (52) 18128th MAY, 1952.CABINETEXPANSION OF ENGINEERING EXPORTS.Memorandum by the Minister of Supply.With reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequers papers(C. (52) 172 and 173), I have been considering what action could be taken toassist the engineering industries, for which I have a general responsibility,to increase their contribution to the export drive.2.       I suggest the following measures(a) More steel should be allotted to engineering firms which are capable of expanding their expert trade.   This extra steelmay have to be obtained at the expense of the less urgent partsof the defence programme, but it will necessitate also somediversion of steel to engineering from other industries.(b) A much more intensive effort should be made to exportarmaments to non-sterling countries and, where necessary,some slowing down in the rate of deliveries to the services should be accepted.(c) Since, apart from steel, the shortage of skilled labour islimiting the output of important branches of the engineering industry, the deferment of the call-up of ex-apprentices,in cases where their retention would accelerate production forthe export market, should be considered.(d) The scheme under which new houses are earmarked for defenceworkers should be extended to include key worker&quot; in theexport industries, so that the housing drive can be made tocontribute more directly to our economic recovery.D.S.Ministry of Supply, S.W.I.28th MAY, 1952.
