(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL CABINET  OFFICE,   , RECORD COPY /   IC.(52) 164: COPY NO.     (G *16th MAY, 1952.CABINETBECHUANALAND PROTECTORATEBAMANGWATO SUCCESSIONMemorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth RelationsAs agreed by the Cabinet (C.C.(52) 34th Conclusions, Minute 1), theGovernments decision about Seretse Khama was announced in Parliament on the27th March.   The Bamangwato delegation have since been told that theGovernment stands by this decision (C.C.(52) 47th Conclusions, Minute 1).2. Legislation is required to implement it.   I have been advised by theLaw Officers that, to ensure its safety from challenge in the courts, it must take the form of an Order in Council.   Since this will have to be laid beforeParliament, I think that my colleagues should be aware of the position.Parliamentary approval is not required but there is always a possibility thatlaying of the Order will occasion a demand for a further debate.3. The Order in Council will provide for:(a) the exclusion of Seretse and Tshekedi and their children from the chieftainship;(b) the filling of the vacancy in the chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe;(c) the exercise by a person or persons (i. e. the district commissioner) of all the powers of the chief in the meanwhile;(d) for ensuring tribal unity.The Law Officers are satisfied that it is not open to challenge in the courts.4. The exclusion of Tshekedi and his children is necessary to removetribal suspicions that the Governments decision is intended to permit Tshekedi toassume the chieftainship.   Tshekedi, who has been confidentially informed ofour intentions, has warmly welcomed them.5. The indications are that the sooner the Order in Council is made the better for the administration of the Reserve.   I therefore propose to submit theOrder, of which a draft is annexed, to Her Majesty in Council without delay.S.Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1.16th MAY, 1952.
