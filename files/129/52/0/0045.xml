(52) 195 COPY NO.16th JUNE, 1952.CABINErTHE DOLLAR GAP:   SECOND HALF 1952.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.I attach a report by officials on the balance of payments prospectfor the second half of 1952 and for the first half of 1953.2.        Although this forms part of the general picture of our economic position, it requires immediate consideration because unless very early decisions are taken we cannot hope to deal with the loss to the reserves in thesecond half of 1952.   We are really faced with two problems:  the immediate problem to which I have referred, and the medium-term problem, which willbe dealt with in the further papers on the rnetal-using industries, externalcommitments, and so forth, which will be coming forward.   Although in the medium term there is some direct connection between these series of papers,virtually the only way to deal with the situation in the next six months is by a com-bination of reducing the import programmes of Departments, increasing immediately-available and required exports such as coal, ana arranging for the immediatesale of arms.3. As will be seen from Table 1 in paragraph 4 of the memorandum by officials, we can claim that so far our policies have had very definite results in checking the drain on the gold and dollar reserves.   We cannot, however,f rpect the continuation oiabnormal receipts,&apos; chiefly the payment of overdue bills.Looking ahead, while the analysis in the memorandum does not represent any fund-amental change in the situation from that which has been set out earlier, never-theless I must warn my colleagues that, if we import the full programmes which departments have put forward, and if there is no change in existing policies, weshall be faced with a loss of gold and dollar reserves of about     175 millions in the next six months.   It is absolutely essential that we should get the programmes down within the limits of what we can afford to pay for.4. The harsh fact is that we are not recovering fast enough.   The measureswhich we have taken have reduced the deficit, but it is quite certain that theywill not eliminate it.   On present policies, the &quot;gap&quot; is still too large to preventanother fall in our reserves, resulting in another crisis of confidence in sterling..  b. As I said in the House on Thursday, we must put the balance ofpayments first in all our considerations.6. This means that we must immediately take action to fill this gap of 175 millions - bearing in mind the constant danger that events will once moremove lens favourably than expected.   We must also take action, as proposedin the officials&apos; report, to keep our forward commitments down, and to make our import system more responsive to the needs of our balance of payments position.
7. We must do all we can over the whole range of the sterling area&apos;balance of payments.   But I am certain that in the next few months much the largest part of this action to fill the gap must come from fitting our import programme to our expected earnings.8. I would like to discuss the situation with my colleagues before make definite proposals as to the size of the import cuts which we should make.R.A.B.Treasury Chambers, S.W.1.JUNE 16, 1952.
SECRET1952-53 BALANCE OF PAYMENTSReport by the Programmes Committee1. This report, which is agreed between Departments, states the external financial situation and prospects for the second half of 1952 and the first half of1953. This shows that the nation cannot afford to buy all the imports upon which departments are counting to implement present policies food, raw materials for industry, timber for housing, machinery, &amp;c.2.   The conclusions may be summarised as follows:  (i) On present policies there is likely to be a loss of gold reserves of the orderof  175 million in the second half of this year, subject to a margin of uncertainty of about  125 million each way.(ii) The -gold reserves are now below  600 million.   A loss of anything approaching the rate which is indicated would be almost certain to lead to loss of confidence in sterling and an open crisis during, the next six months.(hi) Immediate action by the United Kingdom is indispensable. It must berecognised that it would be impossible to cover the whole  175 milliongap by import cuts alone without the most damaging repercussions onthe economy.(iv) About two-thirds of our non-sterling imports in the second half of theyear are already committed. The implications of cutting supplies which are not committed are described in detail in a supplementarynote.(v) For the first half of 1953, when seasonal factors tend to be favourable, weshould be much nearer a balance. But the prospects further ahead,on the basis of present policies, indicate the likelihood of further deterioration.3.   We recommend:  (i) That Ministers take immediate decisions on filling the gap for the second half of 1952.(ii) That from the end of 1952 a new programming procedure be adopted inorder to secure a quicker response in imports to the changing needs ofour balance of payments. This involves a preliminary decision now onthe level of non-sterling imports in the first half of 1953, as a guide to forward procurement, and subject to review in October. It is proposedthat a level of  800 million be fixed, and that a submission should thenbe made to Ministers to fix preliminary quotas for importing Depart-ments within this.4. When the present Administration came into office, a rapid loss of gold reserves was in progress.   In recent weeks this has been checked:  I. What has happened in the last Six MonthsTableI.

5. The losses have resulted from the current deficit,of the United kingdom with the non-sterling world, coupled with the deficit of the other sterling area countries (R.S.A.) with the non-sterling world, which they finance by buying dollarsand other currencies from us. The following shows how the loss of reserves aroseup to the end df the first quarter of the year:  Table 2. Transactions with Non-Sterling World  millionUnited Kingdom Imports ...      ...      ......Exports and re-exportsInvisibles (net) ......Current balance      ...      ......R.S.A. balance (i.e., sales of foreign currency to R.S.A.) .........Total current deficitCapital transactions*2nd half, 1951[Quarterly rate)616361- 45-300- 96-396122(i.e., netborrowing)2741st Qtr.,1.952545383-   9-171- 32 .-203- 24(i.e., netrepayment)227Loss of gold reserves     ......* E.P.U. credits, change in liabilities to non-sterling countries, &amp;c6. Thus, the combined current defict of the sterling area with the non-sterling area fell from an annual rate of nearly  1,600 million in the second half of 1951 toan annual rate of  800 million in the first quarter of this year. It has probably fallenfurther in the second quarter, though not by very much. The check in the loss ofgold reserves since the Budget is attributable almost entirely to two specialfactors:  (a) Our debtors have been paying their bills, and this has probably been worthabout  50 million in the current quarter. This once-for-all gain pre-dominantly resulted from the 4 per cent. Bank Rate and the restrictionson overseas credit.(b) We have been receiving substantial amounts of Defence Aid; we havealready had  40 million since March and hope to receive  69 million inall by the end of June.7. Thus, whilst the sterling area position has greatly improved, and the respitefor the reserves has given an invaluable breathing-space, the underlying deficit is still very large, particularly in relation to the size of the gold reserves.8. It is too early to make an accurate comparison of what is happening in thefirst six months of this year with what was expected earlier. The estimate for theyear 1952 prepared by Ministers last October, before cuts, would have implieda current deficit with the non-sterling world of  378 million in the first half-year.Our present estimate of the out-turn for the first half-year is  395 million, excludingDefence Aid. In spite of all the action taken since, both by Her Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment and by the other sterling area countries, the total deficit is greater than was previously envisaged on the basis of then existing policy.9. On the United Kingdom side, imports have been higher than expected;the November import cuts of  300 million a year were applied fully the january and March cuts were not expected to affect the first half-year much but the original estimate of the level of imports without cuts was certainly too low; consequently,although non-sterling imports in the first half of this year may be as much as  400million a.year less than in the second half of 1951, they have fallen less rapidly than was hoped. This incidentally means that stocks of food;and raw materials are nowin a healthier condition than was previously expected. The value of exports hasbeen much the same as expected (but the total in the past half-year has beenswollen by the sale of material stocks to United States); the invisibles have beenworse, and the rest of the sterling area has fared worse (largely because, of the falls in commodity prices). ; :
II-The Dollar Gap in the Second Half of 195210. At the end of June, the gold reserves will probably be slightly below  600million. We must assume that we shall by then have exhausted the effects of thefirst of the factors which have recently favoured us-the collection of overdue bills.Indeed, the &quot; confidence &quot; factors are at least as likely to work against us as for us.11. The plan announced by the Chancellor in the Budget was (a) that theUnited Kingdom should be in current balance with the non-sterling world (includingDefence Aid) in respect of the second half of 1952 and (b) that the other sterling area countries should be in surplus (a target of  100 million had been agreed at theCommonwealth Finance Ministers&apos; Conference). It had been hoped that this plan would permit a beginning to be made with the rebuilding of gold reserves, if con-,ditions were favourable, and would leave some margin for unfavourablecontingencies.12. Our present estimates suggest that we are far from carrying out this plan.The following table sets out the prospective sterling area situation in the second halfof 1952:-Table 3. Sterling Area Balance of Payments: 2nd Half 1952II.			  million	Non-sterling	Rest of		world	sterling area	total united Kingdom 			Imports   ...      ...      ......	921	578	1,499Exports and re-exports	730	625	1,355Overseas Government expenditure	53	68	121Invisibles (net)	+   3	+208	-f 211Current balance   ...	-241	+ 187	-   54Defence Aid	115		115Current balance (including Defence			Aid)      ............	-126	+ 187	4-   61Debt redemption, &amp;c.   ...	- 31		R.S.A. balance       ...      ......	- 20		Total non-sterling deficit	-177		13. These estimates are based upon present policies (including the November,January and March import cuts) and generally assume present commodity prices.They do not include any element for sale of armaments abroad, except where thisis &quot; normal &quot; export business, and they, of course, take no account of any decisions which Ministers may take on economic policy, arising from the series of papersnow under consideration.14. The United Kingdom total imports and exports (together with invisibles)are not far from balance. But this does not help much. The large surplus withthe other sterling area countries is absorbed by capital commitments, e.g., repay-ment of sterling balances, long-term investment, &amp;c. What is primarily relevant tothe gold reserve is the sterling area&apos;s total deficit with the non-sterling world.15. The underlying deficit with the non-sterling world is expected to improvein the second half-year. There is no new deterioration implicit in these estimates.In the first quarter of the year the current deficit of the sterling area (Table 2) was at an annual rate of over  800 million; in the second half of this year, excludingDefence Aid, the annual rate of deficit should be little over  500 million a year.This is a big improvement. The trouble is that the rate of improvement, both here and in other sterling area countries, is not nearly fast enough to save the gold reserves from exhaustion:  Table 4. Progress Compared with Target  millionDeficits with non-sterling 2nd half 1st half        2nd half, 1952world 1951 1952 Estimate targetUnited Kingdom current ...      ... -599 -291 -241 \ zeroDefence Aid......      ...      ... ... 69 115JR.S.A. ...      ... &apos;    ...      ... -192 -104 - 20   +100TotaP.......      ...      ... -791 -326 -146   +100* These exclude United Kingdom debt redemption and long-term investment in non-sterling countries (61 in the second half 1951, 5 in first half 1952, 31 in second half 1952). These are equallycharges on the reserves and are therefore included in Table 3.42397 B 2
16. We are likely, on present policies,,to be about  250 million&apos;short of the target. Both the United Kingdom and the R.S.A. are responsible for this. Wecannot, rely on the R.S.A. being able to do better than is shown here even if they take new action quickly; they were slow off the mark, but nevertheless the estimatesshow, a speedier reduction in their non-sterling imports than in ours. .The Lpss of Reserves        -&apos; 17. . The non-sterling deficit,1 current and capital, is put at around  175 million for the second half-year. This deficit, if allowed to take place, will almost certainly be reflected in an equivalent loss of gold reserves. Indeed, the loss of-gold reservesmay well&apos;be greater than this (as it was in the first quarter of the year), partly onaccount of &quot;confidence&quot; considerations and partly because surpluses with certain countries will be reflected, not in a gain of gold, but in reduction of their sterling balances or a refusal to make remittances to British creditors. We no longer have any credit on which to draw in the European Payments Union, from which wehave drawn  61 million this year, and we must reckon on having to pay cashthroughout the world.18. It must be emphasised, moreover, that whilst these are the best estimates which we can make, there is a very great range of uncertainty. The sterling area&apos;stransactions with the rest of the world are not far short of  10,000 million a year;even if we could forecast the outcome of these transactions within 1\ per cent, on either side a remarkable achievement the margin of uncertainty would be 125 million on either side of an estimate for a half-year. This is a very moderatemargin, for there are many unpredictable elements, such as the Indian monsoon,or the actions of the United States Congress, which can affect the deficit by scoresof millions of pounds. The estimated loss of reserves could more properly be statedto lie between  50 million and  300 million. With reserves of less than  600 million,this emphasises the narrowness of the margins on which we are working.19. It is almost certain that a fall in reserves of around  175 million would lead to a major loss of confidence and a sterling crisis. It may be reasonablyhoped that the gold reserve announcement at the end of June will be receivedwithout loss of confidence; but if it is found as the summer proceeds that the lossof gold has begun again, and in particular if the next announcement at end-September reveals a significant loss and not a gain of gold, the prospect willbe grim.20. Drastic action by the United Kingdom is therefore indispensable. Thepossibilities of action outside the field of United Kingdom imports are beyond thescope of this report; such action would obviously have to become effective very quickly in order to affect the situation before the end of 1952. It must at the sametime be pointed out, however, that United Kingdom imports constitute only about20 per cent, of the total transactions between the sterling area and the rest of theworld; we cannot expect to solve the balance of payments problem solely byrepeated cuts in United Kingdom imports.21. In the supplementary note attached to this report, we have examined the scope for reductions in non-sterling imports in the second half-year. We have considered how far they are covered by contracts and commitments which cannotreadily be avoided. We found that commitments have already been made for about 65 per cent. About 121 Per cent, of our non-sterling imports are uncontrolled(and, of course, substantial private commitments exist in these). In the remaining22^ per cent, (about  210 million) no commitments have yet been made. We have considered the individual items in these categories in order to establish the impli-cations of stopping purchases in terms &quot;of food consumption, industrial activity,commercial relations, and so on.22. There is still scope for import reductions in the second half-year whichwould not involve such drastic repercussions (internal and external) as to self-defeating for the balance of payments, but it is clear that serious limitations emergeat a fairly early stage. Where the crucial point lies is a matter of individual,judgment, but it can certainly be said that it would be impossible to cover thewhole  175 million &quot; gap &quot; by import cuts without most damaging repercussions.
III.-The Prospects for the First Half of 1953 and Later23. As we look forward to the first half of. 1953, the uncertainty grows.Between now and then,., there may be &quot;major changes in the world situation. Inparticular, there may: be a decisive turn in the United States economy-f-either a recrudescence of inflation or a more marked deflationary movement. A relatively small movement, by the standards of the United States economy, can have a verygreat impact upon world commodity prices and upon the course of trade generally.We have made estimates for the first half of 1953 on the assumption, broadly speaking, that the present state of world affairs continues, but with, some upturnin the more depressed trades, such as textiles, - &apos;The Balance of Payments Estimates24. Our estimates on this basis, which assume a continuation of existing policies, suggest that we should be a good deal nearer balance in the first halfof 1953:-&quot;Table 5. Transactions with Non-Sterling Worldi.   million. . .	2nd half 1952	.   1st half 1953United Kingdom 		Imports   ...      ...      ......	921	895Exports and re-exports	730	.,755Overseas Government expenditure	53	57Invisibles (net)   ...      ...      ...      ...	&apos;      - .4-  3	^ 94Current balance ...      ...      ...	-241	. -103Defence Aid      ...      ... .	115	69Current (including Defence Aid)	-126	- 34   :&apos;&apos;Debt redemption, &amp;c. ...      ...      ;.,	-   31 &apos;	-   5R.S.A. balance	- .20     , .	.         52Total non-sterling surplus/deficit	-177	&apos;    + 13-25. The improvement subject to a large margin of uncertainty-is somewhatexaggerated, for the result in the first half of 1953 should benefit from a numberof seasonal and fortuitous factors. Moreover, the results depend very heavily upon an improvement in the position of the other sterling area countries; the UnitedKingdom would still fall short of the announced objective of current balance withthe non-sterling world. Nevertheless, there is hope to be derived from the factthat if we can succeed in preventing a loss of gold reserves in the second half ofthis year, there will be fair prospects of continuing to do so in the first half of 1953.26. When we look beyond the middle of 1953, however, it is clear that onlya great expansion of our exports to non-sterling countries, or a major and sustainedimprovement in the net foreign earnings of the other sterling area countries cOm-bined with an expansion of production to save non-sterling imports, can prevent a further worsening of the position. Compared with the first half of 1953, therewill be the usual liability of  65 million in the second half-year for interest andrepayment of the United States and Canadian credits; there is a fortuitous accumu-lated tax receipt from an American oil company of  25 million in the first halfof 1953; we cannot rely on any Defence Aid in the second half of 1953 ( 69 million in first half); we may have to pay anything up to  65 million in a half-year forour troops in Germany; the other sterling area countries&apos; earnings in the second half-year are seasonally at least  50 million lower than in the first half, and tothe extent that they are now making once-for-all import savings, their expendituresmay rise. There are potential improvements on the other side (e.g., in oil). Butthe items listed above total over  250 million. Consequently, if we cannot expandour earnings substantially, our prospects for the second half of 1953 in a year&apos;s time may well look just as difficult as the prospects for the second half of 1952look to-day.The Level of Imports for the First Half of 195327. It is too early yet to lay down a definite programme of imports for thefirst half of 1953. The experience of the last year, however, coupled with the factthat our gold reserves are now so low that we cannot draw significantly upon them
without endangering confidence in sterling and thus accelerating an open crisis,suggests that new procedures are required to ensure that our non-sterling importsdo not exceed their agreed programmed level and to introduce a quicker responsethan now exists to changes in our balance of payments situation.28. A hew procedure has therefore been devised, which we recommend should come into operation at the end of this year, by which the Ministry of Food, theMinistry of Materials and the Board of Trade (manufactured goods) will have six-monthly quotas of non-sterling import expenditure within which they will berequired to work. (For the other parts of the import programme, the existingprocedure will continue to apply.) Submissions will be made to Ministers at three-monthly intervals for the establishment and revision of these quotas. Within theirquotas, Departments will have a greater freedom to arrange their purchases to thebest effect; there will be tighter central control in total, but less in detail. It ishoped that this procedure will permit a more continuous and flexible developmentof imports than the present system, and should, in particular, avoid the need forsudden emergency crash action.29. Under the new procedure, it is necessary to fix preliminary quotas forthe first half of 1953 now for the three Departments which will be subject to thesequotas. These would guide Departments in making forward commitments between now and the next programme review in October, when definite quotas would befixed for the first half of 1953 and preliminary quotas fixed for the second halfof 1953. This would be followed by further review of the quotas in January, andthen again in April and so on.30. It is desirable, in fixing the preliminary quotas, to take a cautious viewof import capabilities, for in this context the bad consequences of over-optimismare much more damaging than those of pessimism. If the review in October showsthat the preliminary quotas were fixed too low, they can be increased; if they havebeen fixed too high, excessive forward commitments will probably have been made.This indicates that a level of about  800 million for total non-sterling imports,compared with the programme of  895 million, might be appropriate for thispurpose. A statistical calculation on the estimates in Table 5, designed to bringabout United Kingdom current balance with the non-sterling world (after spreadingseasonal and fortuitous elements) would indicate a level of  810-820 million. Forthe reasons indicated above, a slightly lower figure would be most suitable.June 1952.
SUPPLEMENTARY note the Scope for Reduction of United Kingdom Non-Sterling Imports in theSecond Half of 19521. We have examined the non-sterling import programme for the second halfof 1952 in order to determine what reductions could be made and the implications of such reductions for the economy.2. We have taken into account first, the extent of existing commitments forthe purchase of these imports. These commitments are of two kinds. First, thereare commitments by Her Majesty&apos;s Government purchasing contracts by Govern-ment Departments, import licences issued, and quotas publicly announced andcommitted under bilateral agreements with other countries. It may be possiblein individual cases to break commitments to re-negotiate contracts, to withdrawimport licences, &amp;c. But this is a proceeding which is most dangerous to our credit and damaging to our reputation for commercial integrity. We have thereforeworked in the first instance on the basis of honouring existing commitmentsalthough there may be individual cases in which it is possible to get out of the commitments without loss of credit.3. The second type of commitments consists of contracts already made by private traders; where imports are now uncontrolled, it would be possible forHer Majesty&apos;&amp; Government immediately to re-institute control, but it would then befound that private traders had substantial outstanding contracts and, although itwould be possible to frustrate them (as we did last November and as the Australianshave done) such practice is commercially undesirable.4. The commitments may be summarised as follows (counting &quot; uncontrolled &quot;items as &quot; uncommitted &quot;) even though in practice we should find that there were considerable private traders&apos; commitments. The statements of what is committedbroadly refer to the position at the time when the programme was compiled in themiddle of May; some further commitments will have been made since then.Imports in Second Half of 1952Ministries of Food and AgricultureMinistry of MaterialsMinistry of Supply, steel, &amp;c.Board of Trade, materials ...Machinery  ...Board of Trade, manufacturesTobacco     ...      :..Defence supplies, petroleum, &amp;c. ...				  million		Non-Sterling		Total			Uncommitted	imports	Imports	Committed		of which			Total	uncontrolled528	269	157	112	27572	359	229	130	50116	112	69	43	213	10	2	8	737	36	16	20	2048	40	30	10	630	12	12		1,344	838	515	323	112155	831	83   .		1,499	921	598	323	1125. Thus of total non-sterling imports of  921 million, about 65 per cent, are committed, 12^ per cent, are uncontrolled carrying implicit private commitments,and 22^ per cent, are controlled but uncommitted.6. The implications to the United Kingdom economy of cutting out all or partof the uncommitted purchases for each item are set out in the following paragraphs.7. Ministries of Food and Agriculture. The import programme supports a ration level in the second half-year which will be the same as in the first half for fatsand sugar, worse for cheese and (seasonally) for eggs, and appreciably better for meat, bacon, tea (though of course the latter involves very little expenditureoutside the sterling area).   Total consumption of food will be appreciably below
that of 1951, and will be back where it was before the liberalisation of importsbegan in 1949.8. In rationed foods  24 million is uncommitted, the main items being bacon,butter, eggs, and oils and fats. If the uncommitted purchases were stopped andstock levels maintained, the bacon ration would be reduced by one ounce for about18 weeks. The butter ration would have to be reduced and, as there could be nocompensating increase in the margarine ration, the total fats ration in the second half of 1952 would be only 8 ounces for 23 weeks and 7 ounces for 3 weeks insteadof the present 9 ounces a week. The eggs distributed on allocation would be about five fewer than the present programme provides, i.e., some 12 per cent. down.Furthermore, we could not completely stop the import of Danish bacon and eggswhen the present contracts end in September without provoking immediate reprisalswhich might more than offset the saving. ,9. On wheat and flour it would not be possible to stop all uncommittedpurchases ( 24 million) without risking interruption of bread supplies. About 9 - 2 million could be saved by reducing end-December stocks from the programmed16 weeks&apos; consumption to 13 weeks&apos;, but we should have to pay more next year for the same wheat.10. The uncommitted private imports (controlled) total  4 million, uncom-mitted Government imports of unrationed foods (dried fruits, rice, egg products) 7 million and linseed oil  3 million. The uncontrolled imports are estimated at 27 million tea and cocoa  3 million, wines and spirits  7 million, fresh fish  4 million, citrus fruit  1 million, fresh vegetables  6 million. The technical difficultyof controlling wines and spirits and fresh fish is virtually insuperable; savings couldbe made on citrus fruit and fresh vegetables, but retail prices might well rise.Further, it is not known how far private commitments already exist and there wouldbe risks of retaliation throughout this field.11. On coarse grains, it would be possible to save  12 million (i.e., 400,000tons out of 692,000 uncommitted- 23 million) if the end-December stock was leftat last year&apos;s level and if total consumption of feeding-stuffs were kept at the same level as in the second half of last year. This would mean that present ration scales,which were fixed on 1st January, 1952, could be maintained at their reduced levelon the assumption that the proportion of ration coupons taken up remains at about its present level though there can be no guarantee of this. But, it would be un-desirable to reduce stocks to the level of last December, when they were too low,because if purchases are not spread they generally cost more and because of therisk that we might be unable to make a new Russian contract.12. Ministry of Materials. The main uncommitted elements are in softwood,pulp and paper, fertilisers and a number of miscellaneous materials, largely uncon-trolled, from Europe. The major non-ferrous metals are virtually fully committed.Among the textile materials, cotton is wholly committed in the sense that the raw cotton Commission and the trade have been informed of Ministers&apos; recent decisions on the 1952-53 cotton import programme and spinners are deciding, on thestrength of the allocations notified to them, whether to exercise their option to buyprivately. Of the  2-2 million programme for miscellaneous controlled textiles,about two-thirds is uncommitted. . The programme for cotton linters and manilla( 2 - 3 million) is committed for rather less than half this amount.13. In softwood all except 85,000 standards in a programme of 640,000standards is committed by Timber Control purchases and quotas for private trade.This is equivalent to the timber required for about 50,000 houses; if it were notbought (saving  6 million) a corresponding reduction in use for housing would benecessary.   The stocks will in any event be dangerously low. ^14. The non-sterling programme for wood pulp, paper and., board, includingnewsprint, is- 65-.9. million. Of this, all the newsprint and the dollar pulp is committed, leaving  42-8 million uncommitted. It has been possible to makelarger savings than were agreed by Ministers in March. The consumption of paper and board (other than newsprint) in the next year will be about 20 per cent, below195.1. The difficulty in making further savings is less one of impact on the UnitedKingdom economy, although shortages of essential types of paper might quicklyappear, than of the negotiating problem with the Scandinavians. We have takenstrong action to drive prices down, and if we press too hard on quantity also weshall provoke retaliations on our exports.
15. Fertilisers ( 3-9 million) revert to private trade on 1st July next. Nolicences have yet been issued to private importers, but the buying season opensshortly. Of the programme for &quot;other chemicals &quot; less than half ( 7-1 million)is controlled. Allowing for  2 million on molasses which is fully committed, only about  3 -5 million of this programme is uncommitted. Of the very wide range of&quot;other industrial materials&quot; slightly more than half ( 28-7 million) of the pro-grammeis controlled, and about 18 million is estimated to be uncommitted, ,&apos;.\-; 16. In non-ferrous metals, although purchases are nearly all committed, thereare possibilities of increasing foreign exchange earnings by resale, either of metalor in semi-manufactured form. For the second half of 1952, the possible benefitto the balance of payments may be of the order of  5 million. The aluminiumsupply position will not permit much expansion of sales in semi-manufactured formin the second half of 1952, but expansion should be possible in the first half of1953 at the expense of stock-building.17. Ministry of Supply: Steel, &amp;c. Before the latest United States steel strike,it was estimated that we should be able to import 1,200,000 tons in the second half.If the strike is brought quickly to an end, this may still be possible. 766,000 tons are committed. The saving, if no more commitments were made in respect of thesecond half of 1952 but commitments continued for the first half of 1953, would be 32 million. The effect would be to restrict steel consumption in the first half of1953 (supposing exports of steel to be at their present level) to an annual rate ofabout 15J million tons. The level of consumption of steel ingots in 1951 was15 million tons, but finished steel consumption was maintained at a rate equivalentto 15-4 million tons by running down steel work in progress. No further drawingdown of stocks can be expected. Consequently, if no more commitments weremade in the second half of 1952, steel consumption in the first half of 1953 wouldbe held down to a level of about 2 per cent, above 1951, but this would be appreciably less than the expected demand in 1953.18.. Board of Trade: materials. Most of these consist of imports of fur skinswhich are predominantly for re-export after processing in the United Kingdom.The other big item is plastic materials, particulars of which are included inparagraph 15.19. Machinery. The control on imports from the dollar area has just beentightened considerably but the benefit will probably not be felt before 1953. About60 per cent, of these imports consist of replacement and assembly parts. Importsfrom Europe, which equally cost gold, are nearly all uncontrolled. It would bepossible at severe administrative cost to bring all imports from Europe under control. This would probably yield very little saving in the second half of 1952,unless United Kingdom buyers were forced to cancel their contracts. The amount involved in these purchases is substantial ( 40-45 million a year) but there would bea danger of retaliation against our exports to Europe. On the other hand, ifimports from Europe remain uncontrolled, the Ministry of Supply expects that thevolume will continue to increase so long as supplies from home sources are limited.This may well lead to a decreased concentration on export markets by UnitedKingdom manufacturers of certain types of machinery.20. Board of Trade: manufactures. Almost all the controlled imports of manufactured goods (including textiles) are already committed by published quotas.The textile imports are virtually all controlled; only about one-third of our importsof other manufactured goods from Europe are uncontrolled (about  10 million ayear), and this consists of a large range of very small items, the control of whichwould present formidable administrative difficulties without much saving.21. Tobacco. Although the purchase from this year&apos;s American crop is not formally committed, the trade has been fully informed and so have the Americans.The cuts made in January and March have been so drastic (reducing the purchaseto one-quarter of last year&apos;s) that no further cut is practicable. The more important question is whether it would be possible to step up the rate of substitution of commonwealth tobacco; the proportion of United States tobacco in home-madecigarettes has been reduced from 77 per cent, in 1948 to 56 per cent: how, and it is planned to reduce this further to 50 per cent, by early 1954; the Board&apos; of Tradeand the Treasury consider that the risks to the Revenue in ^increasing the rate .ofsubstitution would Outweigh the marginal dollar saving involved;&apos; :J -42397 c 5 &apos; &quot;
22. Uncontrolled Imports. To sum up the position on uncontrolled importsthe items now on Open Licence include:  (i) The following raw materials non-ferrous and iron ores and scrap, non-ferrous metals, raw wool, hides and skins, flax and flax tow.(ii) A few food-stuffs, e.g., oranges (coming mainly from Spain and Israel) andnew potatoes and tomatoes (also mainly from Spain).(iii) Items which would present formidable difficulties in the way of import control machinery, chemicals, fresh fish, wines and spirits and a largerange of very small items in the manufactured goods field.(iv) A range of goods such as raw fur skins which are imported mainly forexport after processing in the United Kingdom.There is inevitably a time-lag before import cuts on items removed from O.G.L.can take full effect unless importers&apos; contracts are frustrated, and any attempt at a significant early saving in this field may be self-defeating through repercussions onour exports.23. Petroleum. The only effective means of reducing foreign exchangeexpenditure in oil is by a reduction in consumption of petroleum products. Con-sumption in the year 1952-53 is estimated at 22-4 million tons, compared with20-8 million in 1951-52and 18-8 million in 1950-51. Of this increase only 110,000tons is attributable to motor spirit (which is only one-quarter of the whole). the big increases are in gas/diesel and fuel oil, which are for commercial transport,industrial purposes and bunkers.24. Travel Allowance. It would be very difficult to reduce the travel allowance again at this stage in the holiday season.25.&apos; Films. The Anglo-American film agreement, which regulates the dollarremittances in respect of films, does not expire until 30th September. Our policy at that time is under consideration, but it would obviously not be possible to achieveany savings before the fourth quarter of the year.June 1952
