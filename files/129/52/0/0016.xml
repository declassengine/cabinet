Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1952-OFFICE ,    Copy No. 72COPYCABINETECONOMIC policy memorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer as I stated in C. (52) 111, the measures so far taken have given us a breathing space. In the last few weeks the dollar drain has indeed slowed down. But wemust not forget that the emergency measures which we took when we,came into office consisted to no small extent of cutting back the growth of imports and byliving on stocks. These steps, by their very nature, were no more than stop gaps.We must now look further ahead. I set out in the paper the plan of work which i recommend that we should follow, if we are to attain our objective of regainingeconomic stability and building up a strong, free and prosperous country.I2. In many essential ways, we are much worse off than we were before thewar:  (i) The United Kingdom instead of being a net creditor of  3,500 million isnow a net debtor of  2,500 million.(ii) The gold reserves before the war were equal to four or five months&apos; turn-over of our external transactions and were practically always sufficientto cover our sight liabilities. To-day, they are equal to three weeks&apos;turnover of transactions, and cover one-sixth of our sight liabilities.(iii) Since 1938, there has been a marked deterioration in the terms of tradeand there is no reason to expect that they will improve. Each unit of exports now brings us in only three-quarters as much imports as it didin 1938. This has added  1,000 million a year to our imports bill. it means that another three hours&apos; work a week has to be done by everyworker in the country to get the same amount of commodities fromabroad.(iv) In the last war our capital losses at home arid abroad were equal to about one-quarter of our entire national wealth&apos;. We have made good mostof the internal losses, and in some fields are now better equipped than we were in 1938. But the check to our industrial progress has been very severe.3. Despite this great change for the worse this country has undertaken farlarger commitments.4. Internal(i) The scope of the Social Services has been greatly . extended and thestandard raised. We are providing better schools, better health services,and better pensions - than before the war! We are also seeking to providea far higher standard of housing. In the six years since world war IIwe have built between two and three times as many houses as in the six years after world war I; they are, moreover, better houses; and weare straining every nerve to go up to 300,000 houses a year, a figurearound the peak levels of the pre-war housing boom.42286 bSECRET cabinet.

2(ii) Our standard of amenities is also far higher.  Capital resources are being used on a tremendous scale to provide the domestic user with far greaterquantities of electricity than they used before the war.   And urbantransport services are on a higher standard of amenity even than in. the United States.(i) In the middle thirties we had 350,000 men in the armed forces:  To-day we have 850,000 men and women, due to rise to 900,000. Of these300,000 are serving overseas, and almost all of these will be at the costof our balance of payments if, as is probable, Germany stops payingoccupation costs next year.(ii) This year, we are spending 10 per cent, of our national product on defence,compared with 5 per cent, even in the late thirties. The foreign exchange cost of this programme is very large and is due to growsubstantially in the next two years.(iii) We may be faced with heavy commitments for defence works overseas,e.g., in the Middle East.(i) United States of America and Canada. We have dollar liabilities to theUnited States of America and Canada for repayment of debt. Thepresent figures are  25 million a year capital and  40 million interest.(ii) Sterling Liabilities. Our total outstanding sterling liabilities are over 3,500 million. We have contractual obligations to release about  60million a year over the next few years to India, Pakistan, -Egypt and ceylon.It would be unsafe not to make allowance for some net drawingdown of the sterling balances not covered by these arrangements amounting to  2,500 million. This can vary very considerably from year to year, but we should allow  100 to  150 million a year on anaverage.(iii) European Payments Union. Whether or not this continues, we must repayour existing over-drawing of  200 million. This could cost us  70million a year.(iv) Overseas Investment. The oil companies programme costs about  50million a year for the next five years all very profitable, but involving a big strain on our resources. Abadan has meant the loss of a capitalasset worth  300 million and an annual loss on our balance of payments of  65 million.Investment in the rest of the sterling area will require about  100million a year.(v) The Reserves.-Provision ought to be made for rebuilding the reserves.Thus, if we set aside 200 million a year for this purpose it would takeabout four years to restore them to the level they were at in July 1951.(vi) The above are mainly items of a capital nature.  There are also currentcharges. Thus we are committed to find assistance to certain foreigncountries, e.g., Yugoslavia, to which we subscribe a larger part of our national income than does the United States. An indication of theextent by which our overseas commitments on current account haveincreased is given by the increase in direct overseas Government expen-diture (excluding supplies for the defence programme). To-day this figure is about  200 million a year, whereas in 1938 it was  16 million(and that was a heavy year). Even if allowance is made for price changes, the increase is enormous.7. This analysis shows how formidable is the/task of putting the economy ona sound footing. With shrunken assets we have accepted commitments, which arenot only far greater than before the war, but many of which are non-productive.In.total they represent a burden upon&apos;the economy which must be lightened if weare to have any chance of success. Some of them are, however, inescapable and it follows that if we are to meet these, and to be in a position to undertake badly-needed new productive investment, and to make a start in building up the reserves5. Defence6. ExternalII
to a safer level, we must aim not merely at balancing our trade on current account,but at achieving a considerable surplus.8. We cannot rely for this purpose on direct financial assistance from theUnited States. The experience of recent months has shown that United States aidwill not only be greatly diminished in amount, but also closely confined to supportof the Defence Programme. Moreover it is also clear that continued reliance on aidis in itself undesirable; it not only weakens our moral position vis-a-vis the UnitedStates in international affairs generally, but, by disguising to a greater or lesser extent our true economic position, tends to create the dangerous impression that itmay be possible to avoid some of the more painful adjustments that are necessary.This is not, of course, to say that we can expect no co-operation and assistance fromthe United States in the international economic field, but the prospects of successfulnegotiation with them will be good only if we have by our own efforts put ourselvesfairly and squarely on the road to economic strength and independence.9. The policy which we must adopt for this purpose can be stated in general terms quite simply. Our general course, in all our economic affairs, must be to givefirst and overriding priority to regaining our national solvency in the sense of being able to pay our way as a nation in the world. In concrete terms this means usingevery means to secure a rapid and continuous increase in exports and exports ofthe right kind to the right markets while at the same time we limit our imports,both of food and raw materials, as far as possible to what is essential for oursurvival and in particular to what will further increase our earning capacity. this in turn calls for a continuous increase in our industrial production, and for a policywhich ensures that the bulk of it is acceptable, both in price and quality to world markets, and is in fact exported. In its turn this requires a policy on home invest-ment, which provides for the necessary re-equipment and expansion of our fac-tories. In all of these fields imports, production and investment this task of winning national solvency through production and export must not be subordinate to other objectives defence, social services, &amp;c. which, however desirable in them-selves, do not contribute directly to our paramount aim and which would in any event be impossible to achieve if we failed in our first task. At the same time wemust devote what resources we can to producing at home goods which would other-wise have to be imported. The most important field here is home food production,where the maximum expansion consistent with our major objective is clearlycalled for.10. A general policy of this kind calls for action in a number of inter-relatedfields; my views on these are set out in the paragraphs which follow.IllExternal Financial Policy11. I am not in this paper defining the exact course which we should follow in our external sterling policy. This will depend in part on the reactions ofMr. Menzies, who is arriving next week and who represents one of the mostimportant Commonwealth countries. We must also watch the development of thefuture constitution of the European Payments Union (E.P.U.) and of the Organisa-tion for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.). It is clear, however, thatwe cannot continue indefinitely with an inconvertible currency and with sightliabilities which are not adequately limited having regard to the weakness of our gold reserves. The value and purchasing power of sterling depend on the willingness of other countries to accept and use sterling, which in turn depends on the ability of this country and the Sterling Area to make ourselves solvent and to compete in world markets. To ensure that the world will accept sterling in payment for what we need and will trade in sterling so as to make use of our financial and marketingservices, convertibility must be an early objective: at the present time, especially with E.P.U. gold payments at 100 per cent., we have many of the drawbacks ofa convertible currency and none of the advantages. The smooth working of any international payments machinery must depend largely on the adoption by theUnited States of America of revised and enlightened policies on imports and rawmaterial purchases which would tend to lessen the present world dollar disequilibrium.At some stage we must talk to the United States about these matters; clearly suchtalks could be successfully concluded only after the new President has taken office.It is essential, however, that we use the time between now and then to show what we can do by our own efforts.42286 B 2
Overseas Commitments12. We must review the whole field of our overseas commitments, coveringboth our present military layout and the foreign policy and strategy on which itis based, and also our economic obligations both to the Commonwealth and colonies and to our foreign creditors. I understand that the Foreign Secretary and theMinister of Defence have already initiated studies on some of these matters, andI ask authority to consult with them so that a comprehensive review of all of our overseas commitments can be set in hand and related to what we have the economic strength to carry out.Imports13. So long as our external position remains precarious we must retain controlover imports and, within a strictly limited total, must see that the needs of pro-ductive industry are met. The regular review of our import programmes for theyear 1952-53 has now begun and I expect to be able to bring it before my colleaguesbefore the end of next month. Meanwhile I ask that we should agree that nofurther peicemeal additions should be made to the programmes already authorised.Coal Exports14. I make no apology for returning to this subject. It is a truism but none the worse for repetition that expanded exports of coal would not only be valuable in themselves but would have a profound political and psychologicalsignificance in the present circumstances, especially in European markets. In my judgment we ought to be ready to expand coal exports even if it involved risks and shortage to United Kingdom domestic and other consumers: but given thepresent stock position and the recent striking increase in the manpower working in the mines there should be no real fear of that. It is clear, therefore, that anearly and continuing expansion of coal exports should be given first place in all government policy.Trade and Export Policy15. Our export trade is in the hands of private enterprise: the government does not export. We therefore have to depend heavily on industry and commerce,but the Government must do everything possible to secure conditions which willenable industry to produce a maximum flow of exports, especially to dollarmarkets, and to develop new lines of production which will meet the changingcharacter of world demand. To discharge this responsibility is primarily a questionof ensuring that the economy and especially the vital sector of metal-using industries is not overwhelmed with other claims and that the financial climateat home is such that the export market becomes and remains relatively more attractive than the domestic market. It means that exporters must be able to rely on adequate supplies, particularly of steel.. There should be other measures ofassistance which the Government can give, e.g., the extension of the export creditguarantee system, encouragement to tourism, &amp;c. There is also the question of specific financial incentives, on which many exporters feel strongly. I understandthat the President of the Board of Trade will be submitting a separate paper aboutthe export prospects and any specific measures of direct assistance which may bethought appropriate.  I will therefore say no more at this stage.Internal Financial Policy16. Our internal financial policy must work in line with and not against therest of our economic policy. I refer particularly to the special measures whichI have suggested that we must take to put our balance of payments right and tomaintain our influence abroad. In brief, this means that we must avoid inflationat all costs; by a continuation, and if necessary a strengthening, of the credit policy we have so far pursued; by working for continued restraint over wages and dividends; by making more use of the price mechanism, and by keeping to aminimum the claims which the Government itself makes on the national resources.The Bank rate, properly used,, is a most valuable instrument in this struggle.&apos; Itis flexible and can be raised or lowered without delay to meet the needs of a changingsituation. We must recognise, however, that we cannot deal with inflation, orsecure the adjustment of our resources to the changes required by events, without some increase.in the numbers of those temporarily unemployed while changingtheir jobs.
17. Price policy raises particularly difficult issues because we have inheritedmeasures designed to alleviate the symptoms of inflation rather than.to cure the disease. These measures involved the use of public funds to subsidise certainprices, and the imposition of controls and rationing to prevent prices rising, althoughgoods were scarce. Thus shortages were perpetuated, and taxes kept high to findmoney for subsidies. In many cases some goods were taxed and their prices raised to provide funds to keep down other prices. The rents of some houses are stillcontrolled at such low levels that many owners cannot afford to repair them, ata time when we are running great risks to secure sufficient resources to buildnew ones. . - .     , &apos; . . / &apos;v        &apos; . I&apos;,&apos;   V18. We are, I think agreed that we must get away from all this, and return toa policy of economic realism, by which increases in the cost of goods are allowedto work through to the consumer. At the same time the consumer as taxpayer mustbe given some lightening of the crushing burden of taxation, with all its disincentiveeffect. We made a start in both these directions in the Budget.19. It is important, however, that we should be clear what such a policymeans. It means that we must be prepared to accept some further rise in thecost of living, including house rents and food prices.&quot; But this need not mean areduction in the standard of living, if we can keep our tax policy in step with our policy on prices. On the contrary, as production increases, the general standard ofliving will ultimately rise.20. Judging by past experience, however, an improvement in the standard ofliving is usually associated, over a period of years, with a gradual rise and not a fallin the general price level. People are nevertheless made better off by the fact thattheir incomes, as a whole, rise with rising production and more than compensate for higher prices. A good recent example is the experience of the United States sincethe war. We could look forward to such a process taking place here withoutinflation, if, but only if, production increases fast enough.Government Expenditure21. Apart from defence (to which I refer later) the main fields of Govern-ment expenditure are social services, education, and subsidies. We must face thefact that no major changes are possible in any of these without changes in basicpolicy; and that such a change involves major political difficulties and will requirevery careful consideration. Nevertheless it is vital that we should prevent the verylarge claims which the Government makes on the economy from rising any further and that we should make all possible economies, however small they may beindividually, so as to reduce them as far as we may. I shall wish to discuss this with my colleagues in more detail later.Defence Production22. There must be a comprehensive review of the resources we are devotingto defence production, including civil defence and the stockpiling programme.Preliminary studies which have been made in this field indicated that there is noescape from the conclusion that the load we are at present imposing on the metal-using industries for defence purposes gives us no hope of solving our balance ofpayments problem by the only way in which it can be solved, namely by a rapid expansion in our exports of metal goods. I shall submit a paper on this questionshortly.Investment23. I have already stressed that if we are to succeed in achieving our over-riding production and export objectives of making and selling the types of goods which people abroad want we must ensure that the investment needs of productiveindustry are met. It is clear to me that while the demand for investment goodscontinues to be far in excess of the supply this leaves us no choice but to maintaincontrol over the distribution of the resources available for investment. these controls cover the work of the Capital Issues Committee, building licensing, andsteel allocations, as well as the arrangements worked out with industry governing the division of engineering products between defence production, exports and homeinvestment. A suitable credit policy can certainly contribute to our objectives inthis field, but if we tried to control the distribution of investment by credit policyalone we&apos; should have to be so severe that industry generally would be hard hit,and so wide is the field covered directly or indirectly by Government investment
activity that Government expenditure would rise considerably. I shall shortlysubmit a paper reviewing the investment programme for 1953 in the light of these considerations and of our earlier discussions on this subject.A qriculture24. I have already suggested that we must grow more of our food at homebut without paying exorbitant prices for it. The agricultural policy worked out in1947 by our predecessors is clearly ripe for review and we must replace it by a new policy which fits into the other parts of the general economic policy we are to pursue. To this end the Minister of Agriculture and I have already given instruc-tions that a fundamental examination of our agricultural position and prospectsshould be undertaken, and I hope that the preliminary conclusions of this work willbe available before the Recess.IV25. The above is only intended as a rough outline of the course which I believewe should follow. I hope, however, that my colleagues will feel, as I do, that thepoints which I have outlined are essential parts .of a single coherent policy, eachfeature of which interlocks with the others. We have inherited a position of verygreat difficulty. It will not be cured at all unless we take a long view, and applylong-term remedies, and do not allow ourselves to be deterred by it even if theimmediate effect of some of these remedies is unpleasant. Nevertheless, I believethat the course which I have sketched out if vigorously and consistently pursued inall its branches, will bring us to a successful conclusion.26.   To sum up, I recommend that my colleagues should (a) approve the general line pf policy set out in this paper and summarised inparagraphs 7-9 i.e., in all our economic affairs to give first andoverriding priority to regaining our national solvency in the sense ofbeing able to pay our way as a nation in the world; and(b) endorse the conclusions on particular subjects set out in paragraphs .11-24.R.
