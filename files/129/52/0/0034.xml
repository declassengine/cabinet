Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1952CONFIDENTIALCopy No?65C. (52) 1844th June, 1952CAB!NET OFFICtRECORD COPYCABINETGOVERNMENT OFFICE ACCOMMODATIONMemorandum by the Minister of works in my memorandum of 5th March, 1952 (C. (52) 62), I summarised my proposals to Ministers for economy in the use of office space and undertook toreport progress to the Cabinet in three months.2. I attach a statement showing that Ministers have agreed to surrender505,000 square feet. This is a most helpful result which has been achieved at thecost of considerable inconvenience. The release of 372,500 square feet is still under discussion. Almost half this space is occupied by two Departments, theMinistry of Food and the War Office. The success of the economy campaign nowdepends largely on the surrender of surplus accommodation by these Departments.3. I must know quickly what premises will be surrendered in order to plan the movements of staff necessary to enable requisitioned premises to be released.I suggest that I should report progress to the Cabinet again at the end of july and I hope that all proposals for economy will then be agreed.4. My colleagues with large provincial organisations have assured me oftheir co-operation in making economies in provincial towns. The aim is to reach agreement in three months.D. E.Ministry of Works, S.E. 1,4th June, 1952.42357[p.t.o.
