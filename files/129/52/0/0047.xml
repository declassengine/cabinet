7m(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY^GOVERNMENT).CONFIDENTIAL,CABINET OFFICE co:?YNo.   ?fc*(52) 197 RECORD COPY17th JUNE, 1952.CABINETSCALE CF THE CORONATION CELEBRATIONS.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations at their meeting on 16th April (C.(&quot;.(52) 43rd Conclusions,Minute 6) the Cabinet appointed a Committee under my chairmanship toconsider and report to them what guidance should be given on the scale ofthe arrangements to be made for celebrating Her Majesty&apos;s Coronation.2. As a basis for considering and reporting on this matter theCommittee obtained from the Ministers and other authorities concernedstatements of the expenditure they had incurred in connection with the coronation of King George VI in 1937 and provisional estimates of theexpenditure they would be likely to incur in 1953 on the assumptionthat the celebration of Her Majesty&apos;s Coronation would be on broadly the same scale.   These statements and estimates, some of which have beenreduced in response to suggestions by the Committee, are reproduced inthe Annex to this report.   It cannot be too strongly emphasised that theestimates, prepared in haste and at so early a stage, are of an extremelytentative nature and subject to possibly substantial margins of error.3. It will be seen that the present estimate of the total gross cost ofCoronation celebrations in 1953 on the 1937 scale is approximately  Ifmillions, compared with actual grors expenditure of rather under  1 million in 1937.   This estimate, however, excludes certain substantial items coveredby the figure for 1937 expenditure, namely:-Service UniformsService ReviewsExpenditure by the Assistance Board.Our comments on these three items follow.   It v/ill be convenient to statehere, however, that if the proposal to issue blue No. 1 dress to all Armytroops taking part in the Coronation parade were approved and it were also decided that  reviews of all three Fighting Services should be held, the totalgross cost of the celebration would be increased to some  2 millions.Service Uniforms4. The main question for decision is whether the general body of army troops taking part in the procession to and from the Abbey and liningthe routes shall wear blue No. 1 uniform.   At present, apart from Guardswho have full dress, their only uniform is battle dress, which the ArmyCouncil consider would be inappropriate on the occasion of the Coronation,i
particularly as the Navy and the Royal Air Force would be wearing uniformsof superior quality which they now possess.   The gradual issue of No. 1uniform to the Army has already been approved in principle but its issue has sofar been confined to Y/arrant Officers, N.C.O&apos;s and certain special classes and aspecial issue to Coronation troops would be an anticipation of the programme,5. To make a special issue of No. 1 inform (but omitting shoes,socks and gloves) to the 16,000 troops, other than Guards, expected to take part in the parade would cost in the region of  205,000.   If the issue were limitedto those troops taking part in the actual procession only, leaving those lining theroutes in battle dress, the cost would be reduced by about two-thirds to, say, 75,000 but this arrangement is strongly opposed by the Army Council on morale and other grounds.6. It will be recalled that the Cabinet at their meeting on 10th June(C.C.(52) 58th Conclusions, Minute 4) agreed that the proposed issue of blue No. 1dress to Army formations taking part in the Coronation celebrations might befound suitable to form part of the proposed additional programme of textile ordersdesigned to relieve unemployment.7. Expenditure by all three Services on the provision of uniforms,over and above the possible issue of blue No. 1 dress to Army troops, might amount to something in the region of  100,000.Service Reviews8. The First lord of the Admiralty attaches considerable importanceto the holding of a Naval Review at the time of the Coronation in accordance withtradition.   By dint of modifying the normal Mediterranean Summer Cruise andeffecting all possible economies in fuel consumption, he estimates that a review on broadly the same scale as in 1937, including substantial representation   of theMediterranean fleet, would cost some  80-90,000.9. The Secretary of State for Air has in mind Tor the Royal AirForce a Review consisting of an inspection on the ground followed by some form of lying disiolay.   The additional expenditure involved by such a review is estimatedat about    50,000.10. If it were decided that there should be no Naval or Royal AirForce Re view the Secretary of State for War would be willing to confine theArmy&apos;s activities to the Coronation parade and an ex-Servicemen&apos;s parade inHyde Park on the same lines as in 1937.   If, however, there are to be Naval and royal Air Force Reviews theSecretary of State would feel bound to reconsider the desirability of holding an    rmy Review at a possible cost of some  80,000.The alternative of reviving    the Aldershot tattoo has been considered but is foundto involve considerable practical difficulty.11. It will thus be seen that agreement to the holding of Servicereviews in 1953 would be likely to involve expenditure of the order of  210,000to  220,000, to which must be added the cost of entertainment of Royal and official guests, bringing the total cost to some  250,000.Expenditure by the Assistance Board.12. In 1937  10^, 000 was spent by the Assistance Board on makinga special allowance of 2s. 6d. , with an extra Is. Od. for each child, to families in receipt of what was then known as &quot;unemployment assistance&quot;.  The Ministerof National Insurance has advised the Committee that the minimum possibleallowance today would be 5s. Od. and that, if this were paid to each person in
2)0receipt of assistance, the total cost would be  ^ million.    Moreover1, there would almost certainly be strong pressure that any special allowance should be extendedto pensioners, which might well result in as many as five million beneficiaries inall at a cost of over  If millions.   The Minister of National Insurance supportsthe Committee in recommending that next year there should be no such expenditureof public money for which, in the Committee&apos;s judgment, there would be littlejustification in present circumstances.Decorations etc.13, In 1937 the expenditure on decorations, floodlighting and fireworksamounted to rather more than  50,000.   The corresponding provision proposed for1953 is practically  150,000.   It is inevitable that merely to repeat the 1937 scale of decoration should cost considerably more now than 15 years ago.   It must also beborne in mind that perhaps  50,000 of the 1953 estimate will be attributable totextiles, the orders for which will contribute to relieve unemployment.   Nevertheless,the Committee felt that a total sum as large as  150,000 for display alone mightwell excite unfavourable comment;   and while they recommend that the Minister ofWorks should be given a free hand to spend whatever sum is granted him inaccordance with his own judgment of its most remunerative use, they think it isfor consideration whether the total provision for decoration, floodlighting andfireworks should be reduced.Disposal of seats.14. It will be seen that it is expected that in 1953 a higher proportionof gross expenditure will be offset by receipts than was the case in 1937.   This is mainly due to the arrangements which the Minister of Works has in mind fordisposing of seats in stands erected by the Ministry.   &quot;Whereas in 1937 charges forseats in such stands were fixed so as to cover rather over half of the cost oferecting them, the Minister intends on this occasion at least to recover the full cost of erection (apart from a relatively small proportion of seats to be issued free)and if possible to make the stands as a whole entirely self-balancing, if not profit-making.15. Seats in stands erected by the Ministry will not be sold by them to individuals but will be disposed of in one of three ways:-(i) issued free to members of the Royal Household, the diplomatic Corps, Stewards, etc. ;(ii) the majority sold in blocks to organisations at a price  .sufficient to offset the cost of erection for disposal by them as may seem best;(iii) sold to agencies,   if possible at a profit, for resale to private individuals.The general effect of such arrangements would be that, except for those coveredby (i) above, everyone wanting a seat wuld be required to pay the cost of it(estimated at  5. 10s. (covered) or  3. 15s. (uncovered)), except to the extent that the purchase of seats by individuals might be subsidised by the organisationsthrough which they were obtained.16. The Committee recommend the adoption of arrangements on theselines.
7)1oI &quot;^,Our report may be briefly summarised as follows:-(1) We re commend: -(a) that Departments should be authorised to make preparations for the celebration of Her Majesty&apos;s Coronation on the basis of theprovisional estimates contained in the Annex to this report,which represent celebrations on broadly the same scale as in1937 and which seem likely to result in total gross expenditurein 1953 ofthe order of  If millions (paragraphs 2-3);(b) that no special allowances should be issued by the Assistance Boardon the lines of those issued in 1937 (paragraph 12);(c) that the Minister of Work&apos;s plans for the disposal of seats in standsto be erected by the Ministry, which should have the effect of reducing the net cost of the celebration by at least  300,000,should be approved (paragraphs 14-16);(2)        We invite the Cabinet to decide:-(a) whether additional expenditure of the order of  205,000 shouldbe incurred on the provision of blue No. 1 dress for all Armytroops taking part in the Coronation parade or whether the issueshould be confined to Army troops in the procession at an estimatedcost of  75,000 (paragraphs 4-7);(b) whether Naval, Army and Royal Air Force Reviews should be heldat an additional cost provisionally estimated at some  250,000(paragraphs 8=11);(c)      whether the estimate of  150,000 for decoration, floodlightingand fireworks should be reduced (paragraph 13).Commonwealth Relations Office, S.W.1,JUNE 17, 1952.
