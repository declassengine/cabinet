(52) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2), theCabinet decided that additional defence orders for textiles to a value of  20- 25million should be placed by bringing forward orders for items included in theoriginal  4,700 million rearmament programme but which would not otherwise have been placed until 1953-54 or 1954-55. The Chancellor of the Exchequerannounced this decision in the House of Commons on 7th April last.2. The problems arising from this decision, which are summarised below, are set out in greater detail in the Annex to this paper.3. The following difficulties have arisen in carrying out the Governmentspromise:   .(1) Owing mainly to the fall in prices,  16-5 million is likely to represent themaximum value of the orders which can be brought forward for itemsincluded in the  4,700 million programme. This figure could, however,be raised to  18 million by accelerating orders for hosiery, which hashitherto been excluded from the scheme because the unemployment situation in the hosiery areas is far less serious than in &quot;the maintextile areas.(2) The share for Northern Ireland is unlikely to exceed  1 - 9 million owingto the lack of items suitable for Northern Ireland capacity. TheNorthern Ireland Government are pressing, in view of the acute unem-ployment situation there, that this figure should be raised by at least a further  1 - 5 million by the Supply Departments accepting in unioncloth part of certain contracts for sheets and pillow-cases and denim,which otherwise would have been placed wholly in cotton and inLancashire. The cost of the goods in union cloth,  1 -5 million, wouldcompare with  1 -2 million for cotton.4.   The following questions arise:  (1) Can a total of  16 - 5- 18 million be defended, having regard to the fallin prices, as an adequate fulfilment of the Governments promise that additional orders to a value of  20- 25 million would be placed; or should steps be taken to close the gap by going outside the  4,700million programme?(2) Can acceptance of the substitution proposals of the Northern ireland government be justified in view of the serious unemployment situation there and in spite of the higher cost and diversion of the work fromLancashire?5.   I invite the Cabinet to approve the following proposals:  (1) that we should aim at placing orders under this scheme to a value of atleast  22^ million at current prices and that to this end-(a) hosiery orders to a total of  1-5 million should be brought forward; and42338
(b) additional orders to a total of  5 million should be placed bygoing outside the  4,700 million rearmament programme and in selecting the items account should be taken of the suggestionscontained in C. (52) 100; and of this  5 million,  3 million shouldbe for non-wool goods;(2) that, provided that (1) is agreed, the share for Northern Ireland shouldbe increased from  1 - 9 million to a maximum of  3-4 million, by substituting union cloth for cotton in appropriate cotton specifications,the proposal to substitute union for cotton denim being conditional,however, on its being shown that union denim would serve the purpose as satisfactorily as cotton denim. If, however, the total programmeremains at  16 - 5- 18 million, no increase in the Northern Irelandfigure is possible and the Northern Ireland Government must beinformed accordingly.P. T.Board of Trade, S.W.1,3rd June, 1952.ANNEXAcceleration of Textile Orders in the Defence programme . At their meeting on 7th April, 1952 (C. (52) 38th Conclusions, Minute 2),the Cabinet decided that,.in order to bring direct relief to the textile and clothingindustries, additional defence orders for textiles to a value of  20- 25 million shouldbe placed forthwith by bringing forward orders for items included in the original 4,700 million rearmament programme but which would not otherwise have beenplaced until 1953-54 or 1954-55. In announcing this decision in the House ofCommons on 7th April, the Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that the purpose was to bring direct and speedy relief to those areas which have been most severely affected by the current recession in the textile industry and which lack opportunities for alternative employment; and that the orders would be concentrated so far aspossible on those areas. The scheme has now been in operation for some weeks and orders to a total value of nearly  8 million have been placed. I think it necessary,however, to report to my colleagues certain difficulties which have arisen in relationto (a) the size of the total programme and (b) the position of Northern Ireland.Size of programme . The table below gives an estimate of the total programme as at present fore-seen and shows the approximate value of the orders so far placed. The estimatehas been made after a careful examination of all the possibilities within the scopeof the  4,700 million rearmament programme (apart from hosiery, to which I refer in the following paragraph); the total figure is likely to err on the generous side.The expenditure on making-up will be incurred only gradually as the cloth deliveriescome forward:  Total OrdersProgramme       placed atItem Foreseen     19th May, 1952 m.  m..Cotton   .....    ...      ...      ...      ... &apos; 6-2                 3-8Wool     ...      ......      ...      ... 61                  2-95Flax................ 1-2 .              -95Making-up       ............ 3-016-5    I . 7-7It will be seen from this table \a) that the figure of  16-5 million shows a considerable short-fall on the 20- 25 million;
(b) that the total value of the orders to be placed for cotton goods and for wooltextiles is roughly in balance, though it would be desirable for the pro-portion for cotton goods to be substantially higher;(c) that the value of the orders for flax goods is small; this is at the root of theNorthern Ireland problem to which reference is made later in thismemorandum.3. The total of  16 - 5 million could be increased to about  18 million by bringing hosiery within the scheme and accelerating hosiery orders included in the 4,700 million rearmament programme to a value of  1-5 million. This has notbeen done up to the present because the general employment situation in the hosieryareas is far less unfavourable than, for example, in the cotton areas; indeed, thegreater part of the industry is situated in areas where the general level of employment is below the national average. With the fullest practicable steering of orderstowards the towns which have been worst hit, the bulk of the  1-5 million would inevitably have to be spent in the Leicester and Nottingham areas where the industryis largely concentrated, where unemployment is low and opportunities for alternative employment are available. This would be hardly in keeping with one of the basic criteria of the scheme. On the other hand, anyorders which are placed with the hosiery industry would indirectly help the spinningsections of the cotton, wool and rayon industries from which the yarn would come.On balance, therefore, and bearing in mind that these orders would give as muchemployment to yarn spinning as to the hosiery industry and in view of the short-fallon the total programme, I would favour bringing forward forthwith  1-5 millionhosiery orders.4. The immediate question for consideration is whether a total programmeof nearly  16-5 million (or  18 million if the hosiery proposal is agreed) can beregarded, and defended in Parliament, as an adequate fulfilment of the Govern-menfs promise that additional contracts to the order of between  20 and  25 million would be placed in the textile areas. The short-fall is accounted for mainly by thefall in prices since the time when the values were put on the original programme.Prices of the cotton and wool textiles have, in fact, fallen by nearly one-fifth duringthis period. It could be argued that the volume of orders obtainable to-day with atotal expenditure of  16 - 5- 18 million would relieve unemployment, in view of thefall in prices, on a scale not far short of that contemplated under the original 20- 25 million programme and that in these circumstances the Government wouldbe justified in going no further. I consider, however, that such an attitude would arouse sharp criticism both in Parliament and in the areas affected and would bevery difficult to defend having regard to the clear commitment given by the Govern-ment to place contracts to the order of  20- 25 million and the continuing very high level of unemployment, particularly in Lancashire and Northern Ireland. Itseems to me essential that orders should be placed up to a total of at least  22^ million -this can only be done by going outside the  4,700 million rearmament programme.I would recommend to my colleagues, therefore (a) that the inclusion of hosiery orders to a total of  .1 - 5 million should be approved;(b) that contracts should be placed for textile requirements outside the 4,700 million programme to a total value of  5 million as quickly aspossible and that in selecting the additional items account should betaken of the suggestions contained in the memorandum on employmentin the textile and clothing industries submitted to the Cabinet by theHome Secretary and Minister of Defence on 2nd April last (C. (52) 100);and(c) that, having regard to the need to increase the proportion for non-woolgoods, not less than  3 million of the  5 million should be spent on non-wool textiles.I would further suggest that in the additional  3 million for non-wool textiles, thereshould be included approximately  500,000 worth of sheets and pillow-cases, repre-senting the reinstatement of a cut of one-third made in the original Ministry ofHealth programme for sheets for Civil Defence purposes and referred to inparagraph 8 of C. (52) 100.
Northern Ireland -.5. Close examination has shown that a figure of about  1-9 million is themaximum which it is likely to be possible to spend in Northern Ireland. The rootof the difficulty is that the textile orders which can be brought forward containvery little which is suited to the production capacity of Northern Ireland and par-ticularly to the linen industry. Of the total of  1 - 9 million a large part is accountedfor by an order for canvas tent duck for Civil Defence purposes which has alreadybeen placed.6. The unemployment situation in Northern Ireland is particularly serious.At 21st April the combined rate of unemployment in Northern Ireland&apos;stextile and clothing industries was 22-8 per cent, (as compared with 2-4,percent, a year ago) and the general unemployment rate 10-7 per cent, (ascompared with 5-9 per cent, a year ago). The Government of Northern Ireland,in view of this, have expressed great concern at the prospect that ordersfor Northern Ireland may not exceed  2 million and have urged that steps shouldbe taken to increase the figure to about  5 million. Any appreciable increase above 1-9 million could, however, be achieved only id) by placing orders for cotton-weaving in Ulster and switching over linenlooms for this purpose; orib) by substituting linen or union (a mixture of cotton and flax) in the specifica-tiqns for appropriate cotton goods to be bought under the scheme andplacing such orders in Northern Ireland.In either case&apos; this would mean the diversion to Northern Ireland of orders whichwould ordinarily be placed in Lancashire. This would be very difficult to defendat a time when unemployment in Lancashire is high and there is much capacity in the cotton industry unused. It would also involve, particularly in the case ofsubstitution of union for cotton, a substantially higher cost.7. The Northern Ireland Government have indicated how the figure couldbe increased to some  3-4 million and would, it seems, be reasonably satisfied withthat figure. Their suggestion is that the bulk of a large contract for sheets andpillow-cases and part of a large contract for khaki denim should be supplied inunion cloth instead of in cotton and placed in Northern Ireland. The balance ineach case would go to Lancashire. The cost of that part of these contracts whichthe Northern Ireland Government suggest should be placed in Northern ireland would amount, if supplied in union cloth, to  1,179,000 for sheets and pillow-cases and  375,000 for denims or about  1 - 5 million in all; the corresponding figuresif the orders were placed in cotton in Lancashire would be  862,000 and  350,000respectively or  1 -2 million in all. I understand that a decision to substitute unioncloth for cotton denim as being equally suitable for Service needs could at present be taken only on the strength of assurances by the Northern Ireland Governmentand that the Ministry of Supply would not be able, without tests, which wouldtake some time, to assure the Service Departments that union cloth would fullymeet their requirements.8. In view of the objections referred to in paragraph 6, I think it would be out of the question to adopt this proposal if the total programme were to remain at  16 - 5- 18 million. I would, however, recommend that the figure for NorthernIreland be raised from  1 - 9 million to a maximum of  3 - 4, million, by action along the lines of the proposal made by the Northern Ireland Government, provided thatthe placing of the additional  5 million worth of orders outside the  4,700 millionrearmament programme is approved and provided also, in the case of the uniondenim, that it can be shown that this material would serve the purpose as suitablyas cotton denim.P.
