Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1952SECRET OA Bi N ET OFFI Ch Copy N(K     Jg- &quot; RECORD copy . (52) 17526th May, 1952CABINETTHE EXPORT PROBLEMMemorandum by the President of the Board of TradeI warmly welcome the Chancellor of the Exchequers Memorandum C. (52) 166on economic policy. He has referred particularly to the export problem now con-fronting us and has suggested that I should circulate a paper dealing morespecifically with the export problem. In this Memorandum, I bring before mycolleagues my assessment of the export situation and outlook in the shorter term(Section I), my views on measures to assist exporters (Section II) and some reflectionson long-term trade problems (Section III).2.   I would summarise my main conclusions as follows :  (i) We must put exports first (paragraph 22).(ii) We need urgently more steel for the manufacture of engineering exports(paragraphs 11 and 30).(iii) We need a higher level of investment in productive industry (paragraph 15).(iv) We need lower taxation of industrial profits in order to provide an incentivefor exporters (paragraph 33).(v) Even if we take all the necessary internal measures in order to expand our exports we are unlikely to be able to sell an extra 20 per cent, verylargely outside our traditional markets and at a time when we arefacing more highly competitive conditions (paragraphs 42-44).(vi) That the balance of payments gap will not be closed unless the wholeSterling Area co-operates still further in economising on non-sterlingimports and unless we persuade the Americans to adopt a more liberalimport policy (paragraphs 45-46).(vii) That a Commonwealth policy needs to be worked out and discussed withthe other members of the Commonwealth at the earliest practicablemoment (paragraphs 48-49).Section IThe Export Situation and OutlookIntroduction3. Our objective is to eliminate the United Kingdom deficit with the non-sterling world in the second half of this year. Taking into account the expectedmovement of our invisible earnings and the import cuts, the Chancellor in his budget statement said we should have to provide for a substantial increase in thetotal volume of exports. It is now proposed in C. (52) 172 that we should expandexports in the next two years, predominantly to non-sterling countries, by 600 million or 20 per cent.4. At the beginning of this year, the Board of Trade estimated that totalearnings from United Kingdom goods would amount to something like 2,750 million during 1952.   Allowing for estimated increases in price this would42322 b
have represented a volume of exports a shade below that achieved in 1951. Itwas made clear that the achievement of this total would depend in part on themaintenance of a high rate of export to the overseas sterling Commonwealth.As my colleagues well know, several overseas Commonwealth countries have sinceimposed severe restrictions upon imports of a wide range of United Kingdom goods.5. The export outlook has deteriorated since the beginning of the year. Inaddition to the sterling Commonwealth import cuts, our prospects in many non-sterling markets are far less promising. During the past few months our exports have been running at a high level, but this is not a good guide to what we must expect over the remainder of 1952. Shipments in recent months, especially tothe sterling Commonwealth, have reflected a heavy volume of export businessbooked during the boom conditions in 1950 and the first part of .1951. Exportorder books are a better guide than past figures. In many industries, notablyconsumer goods, they have been sharply curtailed.6. I share the Chancellor^ scepticism of export targets. We cannot gaugehow export sales will move during the coming year or so, but the best estimate that the Board of Trade can make to-day is that total earnings from United kingdom goods in 1952 will be of the order of  2,650 million* about  100 million less than was expected at the beginning of the year. Allowing for price changes, this repre-sents a reduction of roughly 3 or 4 per cent, on the export volume achieved in 1951.During the remaining months of 1952, however, I expect our export earnings to be running at an annual rate well below  2,650 million; perhaps at an annual rateof very roughly  2,550 million.7. These estimates which in the nature of things are no more than the bestguesses which can be made by reasonably well-informed persons may turn out to be too optimistic. No changes in policy decided upon now can have mucheffect upon these figures before the very end of 1952 or the beginning of 1953.This forecast represents a situation of gravity in view of our balance of paymentsobjectives and the required increase in the total volume of our exports.What we sell8.   Our exports fall into four main classes:  (a) raw materials and semi-manufactures, e.g., coal, iron and steel and manychemicals (about one-fifth of all exports);(h) consumer goods, e.g., textiles and clothing, footwear, toys and many manu-factured foods (about two-fifths of all exports);(c) consumer metal goods, e.g., household appliances, motor cars and bicycles(about one-tenth of all exports);(d) capital goods (about one-third of all exports).9. There are two main aspects of the export situation production and selling.Very broadly, the position is that we are unable to produce enough of the goods which we can sell and we are able to produce more of the goods which we have great difficulty in selling. I explain below the selling problems which confront usover the consumer goods field.Particular Exports10. Industrial Raw Materials. There is a yfery heavy demand for industrialraw materials and semi-manufactures. They brmg less. direct return. than manymanufactured goods. On the other hand, these raw materials are vital to the economies of many of our important markets,, particularly in the commonwealth and in Western Europe. Our exports of coal to Western Europe are a very small proportion of our pre-war exports and the exports allocated for 1952 are wellbelow the level achieved in 1949-50. Our lack of industrial raw materials, par-ticularly coal, for direct export not only reduces our export earnings but also make sit impossible for us to keep open satisfactory outlets for many of our consumer goods industries. By and large, we have to use the whole of our limited coal andsteel export supplies as bargaining counters in obtaining other industrial rawmaterials and basic food for our own economy.* These figures cover exports of United Kingdom goods. The figures used in G. (52) 172 arid 173cover also earnings from re-exports and diamonds. I think it best to exclude these items because i am dealing in this memorandum with the problems of producing and selling our own goods.
11. Capital Goods. Demand is still exceptionally heavy for the range of engineering goods commonly called capital goods. Output in the metal-using industries is seriously handicapped by shortage of steel. Recent allocations to the metal-using industries for civil production for the 3rd quarter of this year are loweven allowing for the usual seasonal reduction in activity during the summer period.There are many firms who could make and sell more goods abroad but are unableto do so because they have not got the steel. These firms are like troopsimmobilised whom we cannot throw into the battle.12. Production Problems. The Defence production programme is bearingfar more heavily on civil production in the engineering industries than is suggestedby looking at global figures of production. The whole system is overstrained.Manufacturers of components of vital importance both to defence and civil engineering production are unable to meet the demand. Delays and difficultiestherefore arise all along the production line. This situation is reflected in highercosts and longer delivery dates at a time when competitive efficiency is of first importance.13. New Exports. I am particularly anxious about the way in which these difficulties are bearing heavily on a wide range of industries which may well be described as new export industries. I attach for the information of my colleaguesa note setting out some details of these new exports. (Appendix A.) Notableexamples include electronics, civil aircraft, agricultural machinery, heavy crawlertractors, earth moving machinery, diesel locomotives and office machinery, and outside the engineering field there are nylon, other new synthetic textile materials,many chemicals and plastic materials. The pattern of world trade in manufactureshas changed a good deal in recent years and there are bound to be further changes.It is vitally important that the structure of United Kingdom industry should reflectthese changes and so allow us to gain a large share of world trade in new lines. Ifwe are to survive at all it must be upon the basis of gaining new markets with newideas at least one jump ahead of our competitors. Our policy must make provisionfor expansion on these lines or we shall be left far behind.14. If these new or expanding export industries are to make the contributionwe need to filling the gap left by the decline in some of our older trades, they mustbe able to make a greater call on resources for productive investment. We havetaken steps to limit productive investment at home. I recognise the reasons which *have impelled us so far to take this course. We cannot, however, continue to restrict the expansion of new business and still retain our competitive power in the markets of the world.15. The problem of increasing the resources for productive investment, how-ever, goes beyond these new industries. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer hasexplained in paragraph 15 of C. (52) 173, investment in manufacturing industry hasbeen, far too low for very many years now. Control of investment has deprivedbusinesses in all too many cases of the machinery and equipment needed to main-tain or increase productivity, and therefore our competitive power in the world market, and yet we are constantly appealing to them to improve productivity. Thisis a paradox which is bound to puzzle and discourage industry. I must emphasise the seriousness of the outlook for production and e^cports unless we can increaseinvestment in manufacturing industry.16. Tourist Trade. These restrictions on investment bear very heavily onthe tourist industry which, though a service rather than a manufacturing industry,is,a considerable earner of foreign exchange  73 million in 1951, of which  23million were in dollars. For us it is virtually a new industry, which can be expandedgreatly without corresponding increases in raw material and labour requirements.The requirements of this industry are, however, twofold. First we need to inculcatea different attitude of mind:, its importance needs to be acknowledged and wemust face those comparatively minor changes in policy which will enable ourvisitors to feel that this country is a welcoming and comfortable place in which to spend a holiday, for we are up against serious competition, especially from Franceand Switzerland. Secondly we need more investment in hotels, for we have now reached the critical stage where there is little prospect of further expansion unless:additional, hotel accommodation can be provided especially in London.42322 &apos;V&quot;y&apos;&apos;   11 . /-&quot;M^
Selling Problems17. Our export trade is, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer has rightlyemphasised in Paragraph 15 of C. (52) 166, in the hands of private industry and commerce. There are thousands of firms handling tens of thousands of exporttransactions year by year with some dozens of markets abroad. The circumstances and experience of individual industries or firms are bound to vary greatly and it isunwise to generalise about their selling prospects. Nevertheless, for virtually thewhole range of our consumer goods industries the export problem is essentially oneof markets and selling.,. 18.   The main facts are: -    .(a) Recession of consumer demand in many countries where anti-inflationarypolicies have been implemented;(b) growing competition with the strong revival of German and Japaneseindustry, together with continuing competition from a number of othercountries, including the United States;(c) rapid and large-scale development of manufacturing industry in manyprimary producing countries together with severe import restrictions and high tariffs.19. These developments have severely hit our textile industries. But theyhave also hit a wide range of other consumer goods industries including somemanufactured foods, leather goods, rubber manufactures, drugs and medicines andpaints. There are better prospects for some of our consumer metal goods, includingmotor cars and bicycles, but competition is vigorous and these metal-using industries are short of steel. We had developed an important export trade in householdappliances such as refrigerators and washing machines, but the bulk of this trade has been with the overseas sterling area and it is proving extremely difficult toobtain alternative markets for these expensive items which are in demand only inhighly-developed communities. .20. Order books in the consumer goods industries are shortening. A further fall in consumer goods exports seems inevitable in the coming year. This, coupled with production problems holding back the expansion of exports of raw materials,semi-manufactures.; capital and allied engineering goods, means that we are unlikely to achieve a level of export earnings sufficient to bring us into an overall balanceof payments with the non-sterling world.21. My conclusion is that the outlook for the rest of 1952 is certainly as graveand possibly graver than that envisaged by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Farfrom increasing, the volume of our exports will fall. Our competitive power is declining under the restrictions on investment which have had to be imposed. Thosefirms which could export lack the steel to make the goods. It is against this back-ground that we must decide not only what steps can be taken to give help in the short term, but what are the prospects of achieving the longer objective of a 20 percent, increase in total exports over the next few years.Section IIShort-Term Measures to Assist Exporters22. The first task must be to ensure that engineering firms with reasonableprospects of increasing their sales abroad are allowed to concentrate on production for export and are given the raw materials they need. Many people in industrystill feel that the Government is in two minds about the export drive. I recognise the great difficulties involved, but we must put exports first, and we must convinceindustry by our actions that we are doing so. So far they are not convinced thatwe are doing anything of the kind. &apos; &quot;&apos;        &apos;      ;/&apos; ;- -. 23. There is no long-term solution for our export problems in using physicalcontrols or near controls to force out exports. As the Chancellor of the exchequer has emphasised; there will be no need to try to force people to export if the economic climate at home can be put right and kept right. If the pressure of demand at home,including the demands of Government itself, remain out of hand, we shall certainlyfail to solve our export problems. *    ,.&quot;,&apos;;:.
24. The Governments task must be to enable the great mass of firms in aposition to export efficiently to get on with the job. The following paragraphsindicate some of the ways in which this can be done. &apos; .&quot;&apos;Market Services25. The best market services are provided by industry itself. We can, however,help. Market information is collected by overseas officers and channelled by theBoard of Trade to trade associations and individual firms. We can and do help the individual exporter in his attempts to build up an export connection. Govern-ment services cannot be a substitute for the efforts of the individual firm to go out for export business, but they do give practical encouragement to the smaller firmwith limited or no experience of export trade. It is important that the efficiency of these services should be maintained and, if possible, increased. If I need morestaff, I shall ask for them.Export Credit Guarantees26. The export credits guarantee system has made a- valuable contribution tothe stimulation of export trade. We have just increased the sums available for theoperations of the Export Credits Guarantee Department. Special arrangements topromote exports to the dollar area have existed for some time and we are about tomake somewhat similar arrangements for the dollar countries of Latin America.The great emphasis that must now be placed upon our exports to the whole ofthe non-sterling world requires us to do everything possible to develop the use of export credit guarantee facilities. I have instructed the Export Credits guarantee department to press on with this work as a matter of urgency and to submit pro-posals for increasing the range of assistance available to exporters.Medium-Term Credit27. Our precarious balance of payments has made it essential to use theexchange control to try to secure prompt payment for capital goods and to limit the facilities for extended credit. Often, however, the choice is between extending the credit or losing the order and a considerable effort has been made to give special facilities in selected cases, with each case being examined on its merits. these arrangements are, I think, satisfactory, but there is need to explain what we are doingand to bring home to exporters that the Government will give prompt and sym-pathetic consideration to their applications for extended credit terms. I suggestthat the Chancellor of the Exchequer should make an early statement about thisalong the lines of the attached draft.  (Appendix B.)Financing of Medium-Term Credit28. Apart from Government policy on exchange control and credit terms, theexporter has to find the money. There have been suggestions from industry thatthe Government should devise a scheme to provide exporters with finance to coverorders taken on extended credit terms. At present many firms are said to be indifficulty in financing production against such orders without locking up fundsurgently needed for the improvement, or expansion of their capacity. I propose todiscuss this with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but my colleagues should know of this proposal which if accepted might involve Government loans of many millions of pounds.&apos; 1       &quot; t Merchant Banks -  &quot; &apos;,29. i. There is room-perhaps for a greater contribution by the merchant banks,to the promotion of export trade. In particular, there may be greater scope for themerchant,banks to co-operate with larger firms, or groups of firms in the engineer-ing field to develop major opportunities abroad. For example, there are vastpossibilities for capital goods exporters in a project such as the St. Lawrence Water-way Project nOw being undertaken by Canada. The Government may well have togive special help in such co-operative projects. I suggest that we should examine these possibilities; as a first step the Board of Trade, Treasury and Bank of england should discuss the matter with representatives of the merchant banks. ;
Raw Material Supplies30. In accordance with existing policy, steel for engineering exports and build-ing steel for productive industry has been cut back below even the low level of lastperiod&apos;s allocation. This decision was inevitable so long as Defence, Housing andthe Social Services are given their present priority. It is not necessary for me toemphasise that this allocation is inconsistent with the main economic objectives which we have in view.Incentives to Exporters31. There remains the question of incentives to exporters. This has arousedmuch discussion during the past two or three years and the fact that many con-continental Governments have introduced financial incentives for exporters rankleswith United Kingdom industry. Proposals have been put forward by trade associations and individual firms: practically all have concerned taxation reliefsin favour of exporters. This is not surprising. The burden of taxation on industry has been an extreme dis-incentive to productive and selling efforts. As mycolleagues know, it is not simply a question of levels of tax on distributed profits butgoes right to the heart of the whole structure of taxation of industrial enterprisesincluding the method of assessment for tax.32. A great deal of thought has, of course, been given in recent years to possible fianancial incentive schemes limited to exporters but it is clear that all thosewhich have been suggested are open to objection on some count or other. any scheme which would be reasonably straightforward from the administrative stand-point is bound to be rough and ready. As soon as one tries to cover every possibleinequity between firm and firm or industry and industry, the administrative com-plications become intolerable.33. I am sure that we can only look for an answer to this question ofincentives to industry and exporters along the lines of a new approach to the prob-lems of industrial taxation. Such a reduction is bound to help greatly in securingthe right sort of economic climate for production and export, trade. By the time that industry has paid Income Tax, Profits Tax and E.P.L. there is little left that could be called incentive. Industrialists increasingly take the view that the risksare all one way. This is the worst possible climate in which to obtain an expansionof exports, let alone an expansion upon the scale envisaged in the Chancellorspaper.Section IIILonger-Term Trade Problems34. Even if we take all the steps open to us to increase our export earningsby such measures as I have outlined above, and others, such, for instance, as thosediscussed in the paper by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the output of. the metal using industries (C. (52) 173) and with which I am in full agreement, I do not see any prospect that action on these lines alone will solve our balance of paymentsproblems. Nor do I think it right to assume that the required increase in our exports can be sold in markets outside the sterling area, as is assumed in the chancellors paper on the Balance of Payments problem circulated as C. (52) .172.35. It seems to me that we are closing our eyes to facts if we try on our ownto cure the lack of balance between the productive strength of the United States and ourselves. The United Kingdom is only a part of the whole sterling area and inour intense preoccupation with the need to increase our direct export earnings weare in danger of losing sight of this. There has been and there still is a chroniclack of balance between the sterling area and the dollar world. Between .1946 and1951, the United Kingdom received some $8,000 million from the United States and canada, either as loans or grants. This means that during these six years no lessthan three-quarters of the United Kingdom&apos;s imports from the dollar area was eithergiven to us or bought on credit. This vast amount of external assistance has con-concealed the true character of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the overseas sterling area on the one hand and the United States and dollar area onthe other. :&quot; &apos; &apos;
36. I agree with the Chancellor that further borrowing, certainly to meetcurrent commitments, either by us or by other members of the sterling area providesof itself no solution to the problem. Such loans can only be serviced by an evenlarger volume of exports to the dollar area and, as the Chancellor has shown inparagraph 6 of C. (52) 172, our existing liabilities on capital account already imposetoo heavy a burden.37. Leaving aside external financial assistance, the sterling area as a whole has only achieved a surplus in its gold and dollar balance in one year since theend of the War and that was in 1950 when conditions were exceptionally favourable to the sterling area as a whole. The repercussions of Korea coming on fop ofa significant revival in American economic activity produced a rapid and large increase in world commodity prices, including particularly a number of sterling areacommodities, notably raw wool, rubber and tin.38. This grave disequilibrium between the dollar and the non-dollar worldexists at a time when the latter has been compelled to impose severe quota restric-tions upon the imports of the former. The removal of these restrictions in any large degree would clearly make the situation far worse. Moreover, the dominatingposition of the United States upon world trade, coupled with the grossly inadequatelevel of our reserves, is such that any tremor in her economy would have far-reachingresults in the price levels and volume of trade of the sterling area. We are notonly precariously balanced but balanced on the edge of a volcano.39. The United States Administration has made some effort to discharge the responsibilities of a great creditor nation, but it is idle to pretend that we can rely on the United States shaping its policies in such a way as to remove the seriousdisequilibrium in her balance of payments with the outside world. Even during a period of boom conditions in international trade and an inflationary situationin&quot;the United States strict reciprocity in tariff negotiations has been insisted upon.Already at the first signs of a buyers&apos; market powerful interests are at work to curtail imports into the United States. I must ask my colleagues to recognise thatas a matter of practical politics we cannot assume, whatever our productive effortsor competitive efficiency, that we can force our exports over the American Customsor other barriers.40. If we are in difficulties with our manufactured exports to the UnitedStates the Rest of the Sterling Area are in little better condition with their exportsof raw materials. The size of American stockpiles and the competition of syntheticsubstitutes are alike tending to depress the imports of these commodities. Never-theless, these exports are certainly more easily and more permanently saleable inthe dollar area than most others.41. In such circumstances it is surely right that we and our natural tradepartners (the sterling Commonwealth and other sterling area countries and othercountries whose trade is naturally aligned with ours) should join together in seeking a solution of the difficulties with which world trade is beset.42. At present, we are trying to solve the problem by cutting imports intothe United Kingdom, and forcing exports into the dollar area to a point at whichwe should not only be denying much needed capital equipment to ourselves, to theCommonwealth and to the Colonial Empire, but leaving a vacuum in the sterlingmarkets which sterling area countries would be filling from non-sterling sourcesto the detriment of our balance of payments position. I think we ought to pauseto consider whether we are not seeking to force trade into unnatural channels inorder to fit the arithmetic and whether this is really the right way to attempt asolution.43. The Chancellor of the Exchequer says of the overseas sterling Common-wealth, paragraph 23 of C. (52) 172: &quot; They may manage to get into balance withthe non-sterling world. But we cannot rely upon them doing more now or at anyother time.&quot; This is a formidable situation to contemplate since it means that theUnited Kingdom must carry a responsibility for exports to the non-sterling area ona scale wholly different from anything we have previously attempted. It means, too,that the historic &quot; triangular &quot; pattern of trade whereby we ran a surplus with the sterling area and they ran a surplus with the dollar area is finally to be abandoned.My colleagues must consider whether the increase of  600 million in export sales
contemplated by the Chancellor is possible while at the same moment we are being called upon to switch the whole direction of our export trade in an increasinglycompetitive world market.44. I support in full all the measures suggested by the Chancellor of theExchequer to enable the United Kingdom to make her maximum contribution to thesolution of our balance of payments problem. I do not consider that she can do italone; or that United Kingdom goods are likely to be sold in non-sterling marketson the scale suggested.45. It is of course a truism to say that the sterling area&apos;s balance of payments problem will only be solved when that area as a whole buys much less from the non-sterling world and sells much more to it. But we have never yet sat down with our partners in the Commonwealth to see what we could cut out. It is I think time thatwe did so. We and the rest of the Commonwealth will have to consider how bestwe can buy from one another rather than from sources we. none of us can yet afford.46. It will be a formidable task to persuade the Commonwealth to cut back the purchase of non-sterling goods and at the same time to persuade the UnitedStates to adopt a more liberal import policy, and in particular more steadypurchasing of sterling commodities. Unless, however, this problem is tackled at both ends I see little prospect of the gap being closed.47. I do not advocate an artificial policy of exchanging high price goods with each other. The rest of the sterling area will always tend to break away anddissipate the gold and dollar reserve on American and other manufactured goodsif ours are not on an equality as regards price and delivery; if we pay artificiallyhigh prices to sterling area producers we defeat the very objects we set out to achieve, by making our own exports non-competitive.48. Having said this, however, I am convinced that there is everything that could be said for a conscious policy on the part of all members of the sterling areadirected to helping each other to reduce expenditure and increase earnings in therest of the world. This policy must be pursued not merely during the period of balance of payments difficulties but until we have provided reserves adequate tothe size of the transactions carried out by the sterling area. The sooner we canwork out the main lines of such a long-term policy which can be put to the other commonwealth Governments, the better. We could later consider the positionin regard to other sterling area countries and other non-sterling countries whosetrade is linked traditionally with ours.49. The first step I suggest is to examine in detail, without regard to previouspolicies, the prospects for the sterling Commonwealth along these lines. Thequestions which this sketch raises are naturally those which the official committee under the Ministerial Committee on the Review of Future External commercial policy are already beginning to examine and I suggest that we ask that Committeeto go into them more fully and report to us on them as soon as possible.P.

APPENDIX AThe Development of New Export Industries in the United kingdom. It is clearly of vital importance that the commodity pattern of our exporttrade should be flexible enough to meet the changing character of world demand.Though the pattern of United Kingdom exports has changed radically over thepast two decades, still further changes are desirable, especially in the direction of expanding exports of metals and engineering products. The high level of demandfor most kinds of engineering products seems likely to stay for some years to come,especially in view of the industrialisation plans in many countries overseas. More-over, it is in our interest to foster exports of new types of commodities, meetingnew and growing needs. Britain holds a world lead at present in reseach into,and development of, many promising new export lines. It is on the developmentof such new industries that our export trade may come, in large measure, to depend.The new idea of to-day may well be the staple export industry of tO-morrow. Itis therefore of some importance to trace the recent growth of our new export industries.&quot; New Exports &quot;2. Defining our &quot; new exports &quot; as those commodities which are now exported,but which were not produced or exported at all before the war, Table I shows thepresent position of export earnings. There may also be some smaller items, notseparately shown in our Trade Returns, e.g., radio-active isotopes.Table I. &quot; New Exports &quot; 000Group                               Commodity 1948 1951III F.

In addition to the exports considered above-all of which are wartimeor post-war developments-there are a number of industries which are nowimportant exporters but which were negligible before the war. In effect, these canbe considered as &quot; virtually new &quot; export industries, even though they existedpre-war. The criterion adopted here is that to qualify for inclusion in Table II42322 c

The commodities included in Table II have all shown a rapid degree of expansion in total they amounted to little more than  50,000 in 1938, but by 1948they had grown to over S2\ million and by 1951 to  6 million.&quot; Rapidly-growing&quot; Export Industries , /6. To complete the picture, there are the industries which, though alreadyimportant exporters even before the war, have grown since then with exceptionalrapidity. For present purposes, the criterion used has been that the value of exports in 1951 must be both (a) over  5 million and (b) more than 50 times the correspond-ing value in 1938. This criterion yields the following list of exports:  Table III. &quot;Rapidly-growing&quot; ExportsGroup CommodityIII G.

These exports accounted for about 3 per cent, of our total export earnings in 1951 a remarkable achievement.8. The growing importance of the aircraft industry must be noted, eventhough the increase in value from 1938 to 1951 was not large enough to bringaircraft into Table III. United Kingdom exports of aircraft and parts were only 5-4 million in 1938. They rose from  26 million in 1948 to  34 million in 1950and to  42 million in 1951; the figures for recent years include a substantial and growing export of military aircraft. The lead established by the United Kingdomaircraft industry in new types of engines and new aircraft designs should enable itto achieve a further considerable expansion in exports of civil aircraft.9. Petroleum ProductsThere has also been a very considerable expansion of the United Kingdom oil-refining industry. With the completion in the past year or two of new major units,exports have risen greatly-from  6-9 million in 1949, to  12-8 million in 1950and to  30-1 million in 1951.

The whole purpose of our export drive is to enable us to earn the foreign exchange we need to pay for our imports. For most of these we have to paypromptly and when the foreign currency which our exports earn us is not immediately available, we have to draw on our gold and dollar reserves to payour way. It is important that the reserves should not be subjected to additionalstrain through the granting of excessive credit for exports.2. In general Her Majesty&quot;s Government expect goods to be paid for withinthe six months which is specified in Section 23 of the Exchange Control Act. they recognise, however, that capital goods are traditionally sold on deferred payments and longer credit is allowed for these, though even for them they normally expect that at least 50 per cent, should be received by the time the goods reach their destination and the remainder of the price within two years.3. Her Majesty&apos;s Government, however, realise that too rigid a credit policy would handicap United Kingdom exporters. Arrangements already exist for considering specific cases in the capital goods field for allowing goods to be exportedon easier terms of credit. Her Majesty&apos;s Government are anxious to give full support to the efforts of exporters and they will give full weight to the need tomaintain the competitiveness of United Kingdom export offers.
