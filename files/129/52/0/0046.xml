Printed for the Cabinet. June 1952CONFIDENTIALC. (52) 19617th June, 1952CABINETECONOMIC policy memorandum by the Minister of Housing and Local government this paper was prepared before the meeting of the Cabinet on 17th June.The discussion with Mr. Menzies encourages me to circulate it as a contributionto the problem. Objective, and therefore somewhat desultory, &quot; researches &quot; willnot lead to any result. Investigations, to be fruitful, must be concentrated uponspecific proposals and directed towards some definite plan.I.-IntroductoryThe economic situation disclosed in Cabinet papers C. (52) 166, andC. (52) 171 calls for urgent and radical remedies. These must involve freshsacrifices. It is important therefore that they should be, and be seen to be, theright ones.The Chancellor of the Exchequer^ remedy for the crisis is to increase our exports to non-sterling markets by some 20 per cent.This increase is to fall mainly on the metal-using industries and is to be madepartly at the expense of the Defence Programme, and partly by reducing theSocial Programme.As a policy, this has the merit of simplicity. But is &quot;it either sound orpracticable?We are to reduce our defence programme and hence our power to maintaincertain of our overseas commitments. We shall also have to slow down thebuilding of houses, schools, and hospitals. We are asked, in fact, to sacrifice more of our influence in the world, and more of our election pledges, as a means ofaverting bankruptcy. But there is nothing to indicate that such a policy can produce any lasting solution to our problems. On the contrary, as the Chancellorhimself says, &quot; there is no &apos; hump &apos; but a continuing mountain range of difficulties.&quot;Meanwhile our position in the world, our influence in the Commonwealth, andthe moral and material condition of our people will continue to decline.All this seems to be a continuation of the Cripps-Gaitskell progress from&quot; expedient to expedient.&quot; It is &quot; the mixture as before.&quot; But it is not what thepeople expect from us.Is the course proposed even practicable? The Chancellor of the exchequer is not himself very confident of our ability to increase exports to non-sterlingmarkets by 20 per cent. The President of the Board of Trade is frankly possibility-mistic. Does anybody really believe that it can be done? If it cannot, then theprospect before us is not gentle decline but catastrophe. Should we not therefore consider some other way out? Any plan, however exacting or even revolutionarywould be acceptable which gave hope, not merely of postponing disaster, but ofrebuilding our national and imperial strength.II. General Considerations /I/(1) Overseas CommitmentsOur economic survival in the next year or two will largely depend upon worldconfidence in sterling.  This will depend, among other things, upon our ability tomaintain ourselves as a great Power.  The loss of Abadan, for instance, struck a42421 - BCA2iN-T OFFICfc Copy No.    gRECORD COPY
blow at British credit which though difficult to assess, may have cost us as muchas the money value of the oil. Certainly nothing could do more to restore ourcredit to-day than the successful recovery of Abadan. In present circumstances,therefore, reductions in our overseas commitments may well prove false economies.But while we should hold our ground, we must also seek to make the best use,in our own interests, of the commitments we have undertaken. Nowadays we seemto accept responsibilities without claiming privileges. This is a luxury we can nolonger afford. It seems illogical, for instance, to bear the burden of maintaininglarge forces in the Canal Zone while at the same time accepting that our refineriesat Haifa should remain in enforced idleness as a result of Egyptian intransigence.(2) defence comprehensive review of the technical character of the Defence programme is now going on. We all hope that it may lead to economies, both of material andskill. But any serious reduction in real power is more likely to hinder than toassist our eventual recovery. Britain can only maintain a population of 50 million in safety as a Great Power; and to be a Great Power in the world as it is to-day,her armaments must be in good order.Moreover, the maintenance of good relations with the United States and ourhopes of securing further United States aid depend largely upon what we achievein defence. If we decide to reject, as essential to our economic needs, G.A.T.T.(and all that G.A.T.T. implies), it is all the more important that we should be true to N.A.T.O.(3) Public opinion the British public is becoming increasingly restive of small cuts and privations,without any prospect of better times to come. I believe, however, that they couldbe brought to accept even greater sacrifices (as they were in the war) provided theywere convinced that they worth while. It is not sufficient to warn and to exhort.If we are to persuade them to keep marching through the desert under our leader-ship, they must be given some vision of the Promised Land. In war it is enoughto steel men&apos;s hearts against the physical enemy who is about to attack them. In aneconomic crisis they must also see the light at the end of the tunnel. Now they seeonly the grave.III. Economic ConsiderationsBritain became a great trading nation in days when food and raw material prices were low and when the British people were low cost producers. Theseconditions no longer obtain. For reasons beyond our control, food and rawmaterials are dear, and are likely to remain dear. As a result of our social and defence policies (and of our burden of debt), we have become increasingly high-costproducers. We have been slow to draw the logical conclusions of this revolutionin our circumstances. The chief of them is, surely, that we are no longer in acommanding position as purely competitive traders. After the war, it was assumed that we must and could increase our exports by 75 per cent. Even in a period of inflation and a world &quot; sellers&apos; market,&quot; we have not succeeded. Nor is our positionlikely to improve now that our competitors, particularly the Germans and Japanese,are re-entering the market. Banking, insurance, shipping and [[other invisibles,even with the profits of entrepot trade, cannot hope to bridge the gap. If therefore we are to avoid a continuing decline, the emphasis must be less upon Exports, andmore upon balanced Production and Investment. These should be concentrated on Great Britain herself, on the sterling area, and on any -other areas which we canattract into our sphere of influence.The need for such a new approach is underlined by the unbalance betweenthe sterling and the dollar areas. The sterling countries do not produce enoughfood, raw materials, consumer or capital goods to satisfy their needs. Theirdeficiency can, in theory, be supplied from the dollar world. In practice it cannot,because the dollar countries will not buy enough from the sterling area in return.We have now reached a point where we must make up our minds whether there is any real prospect of a fundamental change in American import policies. I ampersonally convinced that there is not. Indeed, the more successful our exports,the more they are resented. I, therefore, share to the full the pessimism with whichthe President of the Board of Trade regards the Chancellors proposals for increasing our exports to non-sterling markets by 20 per cent.   I doubt whether it could be
done in good times. The slightest recession, in. the United States would make it out of the question. Indeed, a recession would increase the pressure of American,exports in neutral markets. &apos;&apos;&apos;v&apos;/- &apos;.. IV.   AimsOur aims, therefore, should be:  (1) To increase home production; particularly of food, coal, other minerals and any machine tools or consumer goods now imported from the dollar* ; area.  :       , ^... V&apos;T-.:.-/,^&apos;^^-y.:&apos;&apos; .     .(2) To reduce still further, as a systematic and continuing policy, our importsfrom the dollar area and other areas with which we are in deficit, and,where necessary, to substitute for them imports from the sterling area.(3) To develop in the sterling area alternative supplies of the food-and raw;materials we need and now obtain from non-sterling sources.(4) To make the best, from the point of view of our capital and consumer goods,industries, of the new markets created by (1), (2) and (3) above.!(5) To continue to promote the maximum, exports to non-sterling areas con-sistent with the above.In a word; we should not delude ourselves with the vain hope that we can main-tain qur living standards by pushing exports in increasingly unfavourable conditions..On.the contrary, we should try, even at the cost of severe sacrifices in the short-term,,to produce inside the sterling area the goods we need. If a policy of this kind canbe,put into practice, it would in due course re-establish the sterling ai-ea on a firmeconomic basis and open for its peoples the renewed prospect of an expandingeconomy. It would be good economics and goods politics. Can it be done?&apos;.   . V-Methods(I)-To Increase Home ProductionAgricultural production must be increased, by every possible method; Capital,investment in agriculture last year was only 4J; per cent, of the whole. more vigorous steps must be taken,to replace incompetent farmers and give a chance toyounger men. We must return to the war-time methods and revive the siegepsychology which sustained them.Some inducements must be found to increase coal production and mineral&apos;production generally. Scrap and other salvage must be collected again as in the-war. The. whole problem should be studied, afresh, as a matter of urgency. Weshould not rule out subsidies to production in growing industries.(2) To Replace Dollar by Sterling: Imports.The whole list of dollar imports must be re-examined and considerable hard-ships; accepted in the short term. American films are not necessary. Americantobacco must be replaced as far and as rapidly as possible by sterling tobacco (andas our arrangements with Europe proceed by Greek and Turkish tobacco). In so faras this is not possible, the loss of home revenue must be accepted or raised by other methods.We ought to be able to get all our sugar very quickly from the Commonwealth.The same is true of copper, and perhaps some other metals.(3) To Develop New Supplies of Food and Raw materials to encourage investment in the sterling area it is necessary that the investorshould have confidence that there will be a steady market for the goods produced by his investment. The first step, therefore, is to provide the necessary pattern ofa high level of sterling trade. In so far as trade has to be regulated, the most liberalform of interference is a preference upon a tariff. But in our present critical cir-cumstances, we shall also have to resort to more drastic forms of control by dis-criminatory quota and licence. Nor can we overlook the strong attachment of manyraw material producers in the Commonwealth to long-term contracts. The precisemethods will vary from case to case. What matters is that priority should be givento sterling produce as a declared permanent policy. This, of course,/involves exercis-ing our right to free ourselves from the limitations imposed by G.A.T.T. The fearof unfavourable American reaction has, in my view, been exaggerated. The non-discrimination and free-trade tradition of the State Department does not representAmerican opinion. Nor does it conform with American, protectionist practice.42421 b 2
r(4) Reciprocal trade measures must, of course, be supported by monetary policy. Special credit facilities will have to be devised to make possible expandingexports of capital equipment to the sterling area countries, for their development.It will, therefore, be necessary to bring the other sterling governments into partner-ship with us in the management of sterling. In the absence of adequate reserves,the soundest financial basis we can hope to create for the Commonwealth is thejoint stewardship of the pound sterling.Trade and monetary policies go hand in hand. Under present conditions, it isvery difficult to envisage convertibility between sterling and the dollar. But once the pattern of trade has been directed into a predominantly sterling mould, there shouldbe less difficulty in returning to and maintaining convertibility at least for currenttransactions. This, incidentally, will do more than anything else to encourage UnitedStates investment in the sterling area.VI. Some of the DifficultiesA policy of this kind is, of course, open to obvious objections.(1) There is a danger of its degenerating into an artificial system of exchanginghigh-priced goods in a new form of autarchy. The President of the Board of trade has called attention to this in his paper.American protectionism suffered from this defect in its early stages. But the increasing size of the market and the corresponding opportunities for mass pro-duction have completely altered the picture over a period of time. Might not thesame be done in the sterling area? Nor should it be forgotten that, in spite of highsterling prices, the shortage of dollars in the non-dollar world is working in our favour.(2) There is another, and perhaps more fundamental objection. It is proposedhere that a larger part of our production of capital equipment should go, notinto current exports outside the sterling area (as the Treasury papers suggest), butinto development plans at home and in the sterling area. Such investment will,for a time, be a form of unrequited exports. It will thus increase our inflationaryproblems in the short term, without contributing immediately to the solution ofour balance of payments problem. In view of our slender reserves, the questionmay well be asked: how are we to pay for essential current imports and at thesame time liberate enough production to make possible the investment of capital equipment in the sterling area on a sufficient scale?There is no easy way out of this difficulty, but the following measures shouldbe re-examined. Even the most unpleasant of them may prove acceptable in aclimate of hope, instead of an atmosphere of aimless defeatism:  (i) Cutting out all dollar or non-sterling imports not essential for preventingmalnutrition and maintaining full production in essential industries.(ii) Cuts in the building programme for hospitals, schools, public buildings and even houses as an act of declared policy and not as a result of administrative failure,(hi) Reimposition of some price and other controls; a form of direction oflabour should not be ruled out, especially in view of the localisedunemployment which seems in any case inevitable,(iv) A realistic and objective review of the defence programme (this is being done). [\vy-  (v) New measures to facilitate the necessary capital formation.VII. Western Europe&apos;s PartIt may well be that if we accepted war-time standards of austerity over a periodof years, we could rebuild the economy of the sterling area without outside support.It is conceivable that the British people could raise themselves by their own boot-straps. But the process would be both swifter and less painful if sterling investmentcould be supplemented by investment from elsewhere. /&apos;The largest source of investment capital is, of course, the U.S.A.; and when a definite plan of Sterling Area development has been decided upon we shouldspare no effort in trying to persuade the Americans that it is in their interests toback it. , . .The U.S.A., however, are not the only source from which additional capital equipment could be obtained. Western Europe and more particularly the heavyindustrial complex of the Ruhr, the Saar, Lorraine, Belgium and Luxembourg, is&quot;
not yet working to full capacity. There is still heavy unemployment in Germanyand Belgium; and West European industrialists are again beginning to talk ofover-production. They have been cut off by the Iron Curtain from much of their traditional and natural trade. It should, therefore, be possible to - obtain a sub^stantial investment of West European capital equipment in the sterling area,provided that the West European countries and their overseas dependencies wereadmitted, at least in part, to some of the reciprocal trade and currency arrangementsenvisaged here for the Sterling Area.The West European countries are in much the same position vis-a-vis the dollarworld as we are ourselves. Many of their economists and industrialists have alreadybeen thinking of insulating their economies from the dollar on lines similar to thoseindicated here. Uncertain of British policy they are tending to the idea of makingthe Schuman Plan Community a more or less exclusive trading area; an eventualitywhich would only increase our own problems. The difficulties in their way, however,are at least at great as those which we should encounter if we tried to restore the sterling Area by our own unaided efforts. There is reason to believe, therefore,that they would be greatly attracted by the prospect of becoming in some wayassociated with us and our plans for restoring our economic strength.VIII. The Political approach the ideas which I have tried to put forward are too tentative to form thesubject, at this stage, of a cut and dried plan. The following are the kind of steps which would be necessary to their fulfilment.(1) At home the first step is to have a sound and simple plan. Once this is agreed, we must consider how to secure the support of public opinion at home. This is mainly amatter of presentation and of convincing the public that only in this way canindependence and prosperity be regained.(2) In the Sterling AreaNo policy of sterling area development can prosper unless it has the support ofother Sterling Area Governments and peoples. Their attachment to this country,their interest in preserving the value of sterling and their political interest in thecontinuance of the Commonwealth should all work in our favour. The details ofthe plan can, of course, only be worked out in full consultation with the sterling area Governments. It will be no use, however, holding such consultations until we have something definite to propose. If we expect others to follow, we must give the lead.(3) Western EuropeOnce a general plan has been agreed with the sterling Commonwealth weshould approach the countries of Western Europe to consider how they might be associated with it. The O.E.E.C., of which the Foreign Secretary is now Chairman,would seem to provide the most suitable machinery for such an initiative.(4) The United states the next stage would be to initiate consultations with the new United states administration, and seek their backing for our policy. I do not myself believe thatour adoption of frankly &quot; discriminatory &quot; trade measures will create anything likeas much friction as many forecast; particularly when it is understood that&quot; discrimination &quot; may lead to early convertibility. I doubt, in any case, whetherthe American attitude to such a Sterling Area policy will be determined solely oreven mainly by economic considerations. The real interest of the United states is that Britain should make the maximum contribution to the. common, defence andthat the British Commonwealth should be strong. In so far as a Sterling area policycontributes to these objects, it should be possible to get American acceptance andeven support.IX. canadian  all this, Canada presents a special problem. Canadian exporters may fear that they will suffer from certain aspects of our discrimination against the dollarworld. There is no reason, however, why Canada should not.also benefit from,any
preferential measures which may form part of the final plan. Such preferenceswould tend to ensure that, in so far as dollars were available, they would be spent in Canada rather than the United States. Nor can Canadians overlook the problem,at present somewhat obscured by business conditions in Canada and United States,of how and where their farmers will be able to sell their products. Who will buyCanadian wheat or cheese in a period of American recession and a decline of thenon-dollar world? As the Sterling Area policy takes effect and a return to con-vertibility becomes possible, something like our pre-war trade relationship with canada may well be restored.I ask that these proposals should be examined and decisions taken.For, great as are the difficulties involved in this approach to the problems whichconfront us, I feel that they are far outweighed by the dangers of inaction or drift.It is now clear that none of the political objectives at which we aim can beachieved without a radical change of policy. Conservatism, associated withdeepening austerity at home and declining influence abroad, will drift to inevitabledisaster. From time to time in our party history we have needed the stimulus ofnew ideas and ideals. It is these which have sustained us through temporary set-backs. We are faced at home with a steady intensification of class divisions andthat sense of frustation which leads to the rejection of all established institutions;we may have to face at the same time the break-up of the Commonwealth and ourdecline into a second-rate Power. I see no escape from these dangers except bjythe fearless proclamation of a policy which will reinspire the masses and restoretheir pride and confidence.This is the choice the slide into a shoddy and slushy Socialism, or the march to the third British Empire.X.-ConclusionH.
