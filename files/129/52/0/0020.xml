J/Pk CABINET OFFICfc(9 RECORD COPY(THIS DQCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;3 GOVERNMENT)confidential.(52) 17021st MAY, 1952.cabinet copy NO.      ^UIMPORTS OF AMERICAN COTTONMemorandum by the President of the Board of Trade andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.An immediate decision is needed on the amount of Americantype cotton, dollar and non-dollar, to be imported during the coming season.Entitlements have to be issued under the Hopkins Scheme early next week,and the Cotton Commission must alsc receive the directions on which to base its programme.2. For some months past Lancashire spinners have been receiving a proportion of 57% of American dollar cotton.   We are convincedthat it would be economically undesirable and politically disadvantageous toreduce this proportion.   The Lancashire Cotton Trade and the TradeUnions have pressed strongly upon us that the present proportion shouldbe greatly increased.   They have asked that there should be complete freedom to buy dollar cotton.   This claim is based partly on the groundthat Lancashire should be able to import the cotton of the quality and pricebest suited to its needs, but still more on the importance of abolishing the premium which Brazilian cotton enjoys over United States dollarcotton.   This premium is today 3d. to 4d. a lb;  but it has been verymuch larger in the past and Lancashire fears that if any revival comes inthe world cotton trade, the margin will widen again if they are unable to buy United States in place of Brazilian.   The Cotton  Commission averagesthe price of American and Brazilian so as to sell all American type cottonat a uniform price.   This is accepted as a necessary practice;  but, ifthere is any considerable premium on Brazilian cotton, this means thatLancashire has to pay more for its United States dollar cotton than its competitors in other countries pay.3, We accept that with our present precarious balance of paymentswe cannot ask for freedom for Lancashire.   Short of complete freedom,a proportion of 66^% Qf dollar cotton would probably suffice to wipe out theprengiurnand prevent it recurring.   We are advised that anything less than60% of dollar cotton would be insufficient to remove the premium whichmight well widen, if demand grows.   If the Cabinet consider that thedifference between 57% and 60% must be saved in order to fortify thebalance of payments, we must tell Lancashire that they must be content withtheir present ratio. .4. In order to secure the 60% or 57% we are prepared toreduce the amount of stock carried to a six months&apos; supply based on a
rate of consumption 10% below that in the calendar year 1951.   To baseourselves on the present very low level of consumption would be anunduly pessimistic assumption.   But we feel it is so important to giveLancashire at least the 57%, and if possible the 60%, that we are preparedto take a risk.   Programming the stock on this basis, it is estimatedthat 57% will cost 2143 millions, 60% will cost $150 millions, as againstdollar purchases last year of $158 millions.P.T.Swinton.21st May, 1952.
