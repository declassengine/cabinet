(,this document is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government)secret cabinet OFFICbc-(52) 162 RECORD COPY copy no.   &quot;?14th may, 1952.cabinetGERMAN FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO DEFENCE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.In accordance with the decision of the Cabinet on 7th May, (C.C.(-52)50th Conclusions, Minute i) I asked our Ambassador in Washington to make representations to Mr. Acheson, urging that the United States Government should support us in the negotiations on the German financial contribution to defence, toensure that in the period up to 30th June, 1953 the full Deutschnnark requirementsof the Allied forces in Germany are met from this contribution.   These require-ments are for expenditure at the annual rate of DM 6. 8 milliard, a figure which Iagreed upon with Mr. Acheson and ivi. Schuman in February as a basis for negotiation.   Mr. Acheson told Sir Oliver Franks that he was in agreement with us,subject only to the qualification that he still believed, as he had told rne inFebruary, that the Allied forces could, by making further economies, reducesomewhat this rate of expenditure and thus make it easier to ensure that in thisperiod there would be enough money both for the Allied forces and the German forceswithin the agreed German contribution to defence of DM 850 millions a month from thedate of entry into force of the Contract.2. In the course of tripartite discussions in the Allied High Commission, boththe French and American representatives have stated that in their view itwill be necessary in order to secure agreement with the Federal Government toaccept some reduction in the Allied figure, and that so far as their forces are concerned, they would be prepared to do so.   A percentage cut of 15% has beensuggested by the French, and the Americans would probably accept a similarfigure.   The United Kingdom High Commissioner has been instructed not to agreeto any reduction in our share of the total Allied budget but to propose that the division of the German total contribution should be fixed only for the first sixmonths after the entry into force of the Contract, which should take us at least until 31st March, 1953, and that the arrangements for the later period should besettled by later agreement.   During the first six months there should be enoughmoney both for the full Allied requirements and for the needs of the German forces.The Cabinet gave authority for this on 7th May.3. It is possible that we may reach a solution on this basis, but I do not feelat all sure that this will be so.   Both the Americans and the French are ready toreduce their rates of expenditure, and are likely to press that sufficient reductions should be made to admit of the costs of Allied and German forces being coveredup to 30th June, 1953.   I do not think that it would be politically possible to insist that if a cut has to be made we alone should escape the effects.   I expecttherefore to be under severe pressure to make some contribution to the reductionof the Allied total by accepting a proportionate cut in the expenditure of theUnited Kingdom forces in Germany.
o4.    The examination into the possibility of reductions in the expenditure of theUnited Kingdom forces in Germany, which is to take place in accordance with theCabinet decision, relates to the longer-term position.   I recognise that it is moredifficult to effect reductions in the short-term, i. e. between the date of entry intoforce of the Contract, say 1st October, 1952, and 30th June, 1953,particularly as Iunderstand that it is desirable that there should be some redeployment withinthe British Army of the Rhine on military grounds, which, if it took place, would increase expenditure.   Nevertheless, I must ask my colleagues to give me somelatitude in this matter.   In a negotiation of this kind, where we have to reach agreement first with the Americans andFrench and then between the three of us and the Germans, it is impossible to say in advance what kind of agreement it is possible to reach.   I would hope, however, that a maximum reduction of10% would be sufficient and should enable us to cover the period to 30th June, 1953,and I should like authority to agree to this rate of reduction if it is necessary todo so.   If it appeared that we were in danger of a larger cut being forced, upon us,I would immediately consult those of my colleagues who are directly concerned,and if there was disagreement between us, bring the matter before the cabinet again.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.14th MAY, 1952.
