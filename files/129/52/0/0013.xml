confidential CABINET office(w)163 RECORD COPY copy no. 55&quot;16TH MAY, 1952cabinetEAST AFRICA: APPOINTMENT OF ROYAL COMMISSIONTO STUDY LAND AND POPULATION PROBLEMSMemorandum by the Secretary of State for the colonies the rapid increase of the African population of East Africa is causingsevere overcrowding in some of the African districts and some Africans aredemanding that European farmers, particularly in the White Highlands of Kenya,should be dispossessed in their favour.   This would not solve the agriculturalproblem, but something must be done to meet the real and important Africandifficulties.   These come not only from the present shortage of fertile land butalso from the need to adjust the traditional African life to modern developments.2. As a first step the Governor of Kenya has proposed that a RoyalCommission should go to East Africa to examine the problem of the land inrelation to the economic, industrial and social development of the East Africanregion as a whole and the increase in population which is taking place.   Theproposal is strongly supported by the Governors of Uganda and Tanganyika.I attach a copy of the terms of reference that have been suggested for such aCommission.3. It is not too late for the East African Governments to guide the economicand social development of the area along the right lines.   I share their belief that the findings of a well-selected Royal Commission would greatly assist them.They will also be of assistance to the governments of other African territories.I therefore recommend the appointment of a Royal Commission as proposed bythe Governor of Kenya.4. Appointments to the Commission will be difficult.   It is essential that itshould be an impartial body of high professional standing.   There is certain to be pressure for the appointment of an African member.   I would gladly appoint oneif I knew of anyone with the necessary standing and freedom from bias.   I know of no African so qualified.   I consider that the members should be confined toexperts in fields such as agriculture, economics and sociology, with a Chairmannot himself a specialist, but a man of wide experience who is not closely associatedwith politics.   I would resist any suggestion that members should be appointed torepresent local economic or racial points of view.5. To sum up, I recommend:-(a) the appointment of a Royal Commission with terms of reference on thelines of the attached draft;(b) that its members should be appointed in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph 4. jl6. If any of my colleagues wish to have further information about the backgrourto this proposal, I should be glad to supply them with copies of the most impressive,but rather long, despatch in which Sir Philip Mitchell put it forward.O.L.Colonial Office, S. W. 1.,16TH MA.Y. 1952,
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ROYAL COMMISSIONHaving regard to the rapid rate of increase of the African population of east Africa and the congestion of population on the land in certain localities, toexamine the measures necessary to be taken to achieve an improved standardof living, including the introduction of capital to enable peasant farming todevelop and expand production;  and to frame recommendations thereon withparticular reference to:-(1)     The economic development of the land already in occupation by theintroduction of better farming methods.(2)    The adaptations or modifications in traditional tribal systems of tenure necessary for the full development of the land.(3)    The opening for cultivation and settlement of land at present not fullyutilised.(4)    The forms of organisation and methods required to secure the maximumproductivity of the land under (1), (2) and (3) above compatible with thepreservation and improvement of the soil.(5)    The development and siting of industrial activities with reference to thegrowth and location of the population and to agrarian and social conditions.(6)     Wage policy and conditions of employment in industry, commerce, mining and plantation agriculture with special reference to social conditions and the growth of large urban populations.(7)    The problems of social security which arise from the growth ofpermanent urban and industrial populations.2. The Commission should examine and report on the above matters takingas a basis the general propositions embodied in Part VI of Sir Philip Mitchell&apos;despatch to the Secretary of State of 1951.The Members of the Commission should hold themselves free toexamine, and where necessary comment upon, policy in such related fields asEducation and Public Health which appear to them to have a bearing on the problems with which they ara primarily concerned;   in particular the extent to whichexisting technical training facilities are adequate to meet the requirements of extensive industrial development.   The Commission should also considerprobable trends of population in East Africa and make such recommendations asthey consider appropriate on this subject in relation to the other problems involved.In their deliberations the Commission should take account ofexisting obligations incurred by treaty, agreement or formal declaration ofpolicy in relation to the security of land reserved for the different races and groups in various parts of the Territories concerned.
