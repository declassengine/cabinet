CONFIDENTIAL converted No 6---- ;          /CABINET office- *52) 190 RECORD COPY &quot;.11th June, 1952 &apos;      ,; &apos;V\.. &apos;,, ,cabinet national HEALTH SERVICE: DANCKWERTS AWARDMemorandum by the Chancellor of the exchequer the Award gives the general practitioners the arrears of pay back to thebeginning of the Health Service in 1948 which Mr. Justice Danckwerts thinksthey should have had on the basis of the Spens Report which the previous Govern-ment accepted. These arrears amount to some  27 million for the period July1948 to March 1952. We must also take into account the cost of applying theAward in the current year, which will be about  10 million, in addition to theexisting Estimate provision. Thus the gross total which we should have to findthis year as a result of the Award is  37 million.2. This is a heavy blow, especially in view of all the other factors such aswage and price increases which are also tending independently to reduce theestimated Budget surplus this year.3. T have, therefore, been considering whether the burden on the Budget mightbe lightened by taking the line that we cannot pay off the arrears in full at once,but would propose to pay them over a period, say, the five years 1952-57, at therate of something like  5% million a year. This would mean that I should haveto find some  15^ million this year ( 10 million for 1952-53, plus, say,  5^ million of arrears) instead of  37 million.4. Apart from the Budgetary aspect, payment of these arrears by instalmentsover a period, by making it clear that the Government are not in a position tosplash money about on the doctors, might have a good psychological effect in helping to keep other wage and salary claims within reasonable limits.5. The Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland have represented to me, however, that a decision to postpone payment would be stronglyresented by the medical profession. The B.M.A. have been persuaded with some difficulty to use their influence against any demand that doctors&apos; remunerationshould be on a sliding scale linked to the cost of living, and the Health ministers are reluctant now to become involved in a further dispute on this subject. Inaddition, payments of the arrears by instalments would give rise to a number of administrative difficulties. In the circumstances I do not propose to press thissuggestion.Effect of the Award on other Classes of Staff6. The Award raises certain other serious wages policy considerations. Itwill probably be claimed that the Danckwerts Award is an indication that the salaries of other professional grades in the public services should be increased torates 100 per cent, above the rates in force&quot; in 1939. Such a claim, if accepted,would have most serious reactions. The class immediately affected is consultantsin the National Health Service. At present whole-time consultants are paid salariesranging from  1,700 at age 32 to  2,750 at age 40, but these rates may be supple-mented by Distinction Awards ranging from  500 to  2,500 per annum. The fulleffective salary range is thus from  1,700 to  5,250. The application of Danckwertsprinciples would increase those rates to  2,750 at the minimum and to  7,130 atthe maximum.   There would inevitably be further reactions first on University42393Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1952
medical staffs and thence to the non-medical staffs of the universities. Reactionswould then spread first to the higher Civil Service, then probably to the teachingprofessions and ultimately widely throughout the public services. Moreover, iflarge numbers of the higher paid staff in the public services were given substantialsalary increases at the present time it would be quite impossible to expect thelower paid staffs or workers in industry to exercise restraint. Unless, therefore,the chain of reactions is broken at the first link, viz., the consultants, we shall find that a further inflationary cycle in the country at large has been started.   -s ,7. T consider that we should be justified in going to considerable lengths to,prevent these reactions.   I think we must declare publicly that we are not preparedto apply the principles of the Danckwerts Award to other professional classes, and indeed that we cannot continue to be bound by the recommendations of the SpensReports (of which the Danckwerts Award was supposed to be an application).8. If my colleagues agree that a statement to this effect should be made, wehave the alternative of waiting and making it in reply to some particular claim(e.g., that of the consultants which is understood to be in preparation) or of takingthe initiative and making an early statement in anticipation of claims for increasescorresponding to those of the Danckwerts Award. If we wait until an opportunityarises in negotiations on a particular claim, we may be accused of making up our policy on the spur of the moment for the purpose of dealing with that particularclaim, and we may also in the meantime encourage, by our silence, classes who arenourishing hopes of supporting salary claims by appealing to the argument that whatis sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.9. A refusal to extend Danckwerts increases to consultants will not be an easyproposition. Spens dealt with consultants and general practitioners on precisely the same basis in so far as he recommended rates of remuneration applicable to theconditions of 1939, leaving it to subsequent negotiation to settle how far these rates should be increased to take account of subsequent changes in the value ofmoney. Before Danckwerts both general practitioners and specialists got the Spensrates plus 20 per cent. a figure prescribed by the Government but not accepted bythe B.M.A. The consultants will certainly say that it is manifestly unjust thatSpens;s recommendations should be implemented for the general practitioners but be discounted by 80 per cent, in their own case. They may also argue that the SpensCommittee, as a body of independent experts of high standing, established arelationship between the remuneration of consultants and that of general practi-practitioners which should not be disturbed without reference to some similar independent body. If we meet these arguments by a flat refusal of the Danckwerts increase weshall almost certainly be involved in a row with the Consultants Committee andprobably also with the B.M.A. But if we are to avoid the serious consequences Ihave outlined in paragraph 6 above, I consider that we must take a tough line on thisquestion, even at the risk of criticism.10. I therefore ask my colleagues to agree that I should make an early public statement, in reply to an arranged question, on the lines of the draft attached. Iunderstand that the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister of Health arein broad agreement with my conclusions.R. A. B.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,11th June, 1952.
appendix draft Statement to be Made in Reply to an Arranged QuestionQuestionTo ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer whether, in the light of the DanckwertsAward to general practitioners, he has any statement to make about the adjustment to pay in other occupations. \A nswerYes, Sir. While the adjustment of salaries is a matter to be dealt with throughthe established negotiating machinery, the Government must he much concerned,as is this House, at any developments which might substantially affect the publicpurse and the general economic situation.I feel that it is my duty to make clear that the Government in acceptingMr. Justice Danckwerts&apos;s Award on the remuneration of general practitioners havenot at all accepted that similar adjustments in other fields are appropriate. TheGovernment do not accept the principle that in other professional classes, including those in other branches of the National Health Service, the right standard of remuneration is 1939 salaries increased by 100 per cent. In their View salariesshould be determined in the light of all the circumstances prevailing at the time.
