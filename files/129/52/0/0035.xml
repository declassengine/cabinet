Printed for the Cabinet.   June 1952SECRET   :CABINET OFFICfe copy no.r(C- RECORD COPY , &apos;UC. (52) 1859th June, 1952CABINETGERMAN FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO defence memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign AffairsThe Cabinet will wish to know the result of the negotiations on the abovesubject which I last brought before them on 15th May in my paper C. (52) 162.It quickly.became,apparent in these negotiations that we should only be able toreach agreement on the division of the total German contribution of DM. 850 million a month on: a basis which provided a progressively increasing amount for theGerman contingents to the European Defence Community (E.D.C.) to match theirincreasing rate of expenditure and so a progressively declining amount for theAllied forces: - With the agreement of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Ministerof Defence and the.Secretaries of State for War and Air, I authorised the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Germany to agree that the division should be worked out on this basis.2. Agreement was eventually reached on the following division in the period between the entry into force of the agreements and 30th June, 1953:  Allied forcesE.D.C.TotalFirst six monthsDM. million a month551299850Next three monthsDM. million a month319531850Remainingperiod(if any)To be settled by lateragreementThe Allied budget figures had required an average monthly figure of DM. 566 amonth, but we had accepted that this should be reduced by 10 per cent., i.e., toDM. 510 a month. The above arrangement would provide an average monthlyfigure of DM. 474 over the full nine months. But, as I explain below, it is unlikelythat the period will in fact be as long as nine months, in which case we shall benefit from the higher figure for the six-month period. The detailed figures for theindividual forces, including our own, are not yet available, but it has been agreedthat the Allied total shall be distributed in proportion to the estimates of the forces.The figures for German costs which we accepted as a basis for the division werethe lower (i.e., non-German) Paris Conference estimate for costs other than for heavy equipment, plus about half that for heavy equipment. (See paragraph 3 of annex B to my memorandum C. (52) 141.)3. The reduced Allied requirements will, therefore, be more than covered inthe six months, and it will be possible to carry a surplus, forward which wouldenable Allied costs to be met up to the beginning of the third month of the thirdquarter. Whether in the event our full requirements will be covered to 30th Junedepends, therefore, on the date when the agreement with Germany and the E.D.C.Treaty will have been ratified by all the signatories. It is impossible to forecast this date, since so much will depend on the course of events during the summer andautumn. It seems reasonably certain, however, that the French Government willnot even submit the agreements to the French Parliament before the autumn, and42380
I doubt whether in fact the process of ratification in France will be completed before the end of the year. Quite apart from the obvious doubts which exist inFrance about the political wisdom of ratification, there is also the serious practicalconsideration that the sooner a beginning is made with the German contingents,the greater will be the competition for the military equipment available, principallyfrom&apos; the United States, during the next year when supplies are severely, limited,The time it will take to secure ratification in Germany is also speculative, in-.viewof the strength of the opposition to Dr. Adenauer and the uncertainties that will inevitably be produced by the diplomatic offensive of the Soviet Union. I believethat the Netherlands ratification process is also unlikely to be completed speedilyand this may be true of other E.D.C. countries. My conclusion is that it is unlikelythat ratification by all parties will be completed earlier than 1st November (whichis the date which the Federal Government is now assuming for its own financialcalculations). If this proves to be so, our full Deutschemark requirements for thelocal costs of United Kingdom forces will be met from the German contributionuntil 30th June, 1953. If the date is later, we should gain financially.      .4. The agreement with Germany provides that for the period after 30th June,1953, the total German defence contribution is to be established on thesame standards as that of North Atlantic Treaty countries and is to beused in part to assist to meet the costs of non-E.D.C. Powers with forcesin Germany. The. amount to be provided for this purpose is to be nego-tiated with Germany and the E.D.C. The negotiations for a german contribution to the support of our forces in the period after 30th June, 1953,will be difficult, for we must assume that the E.D.C., with which to a large extent they will be conducted, will then be in being. The French have made it clear thatthe E.D.C. will demand first priority for the meeting of its needs from the contri-butions. to defence of all members, including the Federal Republic, before anythingis provided for countries which are not members. We have good counter-arguments in the important part which our forces in Germany must play in. the western defence plan and in our own economic difficulties, and I hope that we shall be ableto obtain full American support. Nevertheless, we cannot be optimistic about the outcome of the negotiations, especially as we shall have to reckon with the proba-bility that after June 1953 the cost of the German contingents will be mountingrapidly. While, therefore, we shall not relax our efforts to obtain a substantial contribution from German sources, I think we should be wise, for our own domestic purposes, to assume that the assistance that we shall receive from German sourcesafter the middle of next year will be very small.A.
