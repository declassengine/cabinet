R DropyS EC R E TC. (52) 18710TH JUNE, 1952CABINETPROGRESS OF SUPER-PRIORITY scheme memorandum by the Minister of supply on the 13th March, 1952, the Cabinet decided to accord &quot;Super-Priority&quot;to the production of the most up-to-date jet aircraft and certain other defence equipment, and I was asked to report progress from time to time (C.C.(52) 30thConclusions, Minute 5).2. The Super-Priority scheme has now come into general operation and,although it has only been in force for a few weeks, it has already produced some improvement in the supply of materials and labour.   There is no doubt that it hashad a stimulating effect on the industries concerned and that it will over a periodproduce an appreciable acceleration of production.3. The output of Canberra light bombers is building up steadily, and this typegives no cause for concern.   The other Super-Priority types for which production orders have been placed more recently (Hunter, Swift, Valiant and Gannet) are going ahead smoothly and deliveries should start approximately at the dates planned withthe prospect later of some improvement on the rate of deliveries previously forecast.copy no. .Q \y4. The development of the still newer types of military aircraft has also been proceeding satisfactorily.   In the case of the Gloster F, 4 all-weather fighter and theB. 35 heavy bomber we have now reached the stage when production orders should beplaced.   Subject to the approval of the Treasury, I propose to place orders forthwithfor two hundred of the former and fifty of the latter.5. The Cabinet has already accorded Super-Priority to the F. 4.    I ask that similar priority should now be given to the B. 35.D.S.Ministry of Supply, S. W. 1.,10TH JUNE, 1952.
