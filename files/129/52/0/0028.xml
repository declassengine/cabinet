confidnetial cabinet office record copy . (52) 178 . COPY NO.    ^     /27th MAY, 1952.cabinet food PRICES.Memorandum by the Minister of Food.My colleagues are, of course, aware of the increases inthe prices of subsidised foods which were described in general outlinein the Budget statement, and I shall consult them about the detailsof each proposed change as the time comes to make it.   The PrimeMinister has suggested to me, however, that my colleagues may also liketo be aware of changes in the prices of unsubsidised foods which are stillsubject to control, and in the appendix to this Memorandum details aregiven of a number   of particular changes which are shortly to be made.Where food is subject to price control but is notsubsidised, my main responsibility is to see that the prices paid by thepublic are not higher than is required to cover necessary costs of procuring,processing and distributing the products in question;  but if these costsincrease, corresponding increases in prices must be made promptly inorder that the Ministry of Food may not become involved in a trading losswhich would be the beginning of a new subsidy.G.L-G.Ministry of Food, S.W.1.27th MAY, 1952.
