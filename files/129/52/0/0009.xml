HI&quot;     kr. t   &apos;COMMAND IN THE MEDITERRANEANMemorandum by the Minister of defence at the request of the Cabinet I have prepared this memorandumstating the problem to be solved and summarising the discussions which tookplace with Admiral Fechteler.   The problem has been fully considered by theChiefs of Staff and I am in agreement with the proposals they have formulatedand which they expounded to Admiral Fechteler.2. Witat is required is a system of command in the Mediterraneanwhich will take account of the situation likely to develop in that area, should warbreak out, and which will ensure that the various strategic interests are properlyrelated to each other and dealt with.   At Lisbon the system of command in theMediterranean was looked at from the point of view of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (N.A.T.O.), and then deferred for further examination and reportto the next meeting of the Council.   The problem however has a much widersetting.The British view. Once war starts there will be no N.A.T.O. and non-N.A.T.Q. theatres of operations, but the Western Allies will be fighting on a global basis.   The Linesof Communication of two separate commands run through the Mediterranean.These commands are:(a) The Southern Flank of SACEUR&apos;s Command - aN.A.T.O. Command under C.-in-C. South.(b) The Middle East - at present a British Command outsideN.A.T.O. in which British and not American forces and interests will predominate.4. In war, the naval command in the Mediterranean must be a unifiedAllied command, organised in such a way that the requirements of   SHAPE&apos;sSouthern Flank and of the Middle East will receive proper attention.   There isnot room in the Mediterranean for two separate naval commands, one looking after the requirements of SHAPE, and the other looking after the requirementsof the Middle East.   The naval and air forces of several nations engaged insubmarine, anti-submarine, minelaying, minesweeping, convoy and offensive operations may be conflicting and all will need co-ordination.   Account must also be taken of strategic and other air traffic.-5. The Allied Naval Commander, in our view, must co-operate with andserve both the European and Middle East Commands, but, as their interestsmay from time to time clash, he must be given strategic guidance.

/ffJjbe done effectively by placing him directly under the authority which controls^ftie global strategy of the war.   This authority we must at present assume to bethe Standing Group.   It would be just as wrong to place the Allied naval commander under SACEUR&apos;s Commander-in-Chief, South, as it would be toput him under the Commander of the forces in the Middle East.6. We fully recognise that the United States Carrier and AmphibiousTask Forces have been allocated to SHAPE by the President of the UnitedStates.     Nevertheless, the co-ordination of their activities with other navaland air operations in the Mediterranean must be the responsibility of the allied naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean.7. These views were expressed fully and clearly to Admiral Fechteler.The United States View8. Admiral Fechteler&apos;s views seemed to be based on the idea that until an Allied Middle East Command is set up, the system of command in theMediterranean should take no cognizance of the requirements of the Middle East.He repeatedly emphasised that his task was to set up a N.A.T.Q. Command in the narrow sense.   Thus, although he fully agreed that there should be an allied naval Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean, he considered that thisCommander-in-Chief must be subordinate to Commander-in-Chief,   South.   Insupport of his view he argued:(a) that it was essential that Commander-in-Chief, South,should have control of all naval and air forces supportinghis operations along the whole of the northern shore of theMediterranean.   This must include   the control of his logistic support, i. e. of his lines of communication from Gibraltar;(b) that the President of the United States had specificallycommitted United States naval forces to the Mediterraneanfor a N.A.T.O. task, namely the support of SACEUR&apos;right flank;(c) that the French and Italian naval authorities had expressed their view strongly that their naval forces and the control of theirown particular communications should be under the command ofthe Commander-in-Chief, South.9. Admiral Fechteler was asked how, under his proposed system, theimportant interests of the Middle East Command would be satisfied.   He gave no satisfactory reply on this point.   Hevmerely indicated that he did not think aN.A.T.O.   Commander-in-Chief should have responsibilities outside N.A.T.O. andhe said that this view was held by several other N.A.T.O. powers, particularly the Scandinavians.   He did, when pressed, agree that the N.A.T.O. commander in the Mediterranean would in fact have to have some responsibility for convoysto the Middle East.10. It can be seen from the above summary that the real points of difference between ourselves and the Americans are:(a)   Whether the Allied Naval Commander in the Mediterraneanshould be responsible to the Standing Group, or to SACEUR&apos;sCommander-in-Chief, South.......   -2-        // -f&apos;lII
Whether, in the present state of planning, the systemof command in the Mediterranean should take equal accountof the requirements of the forces in Europe and the forcesin the Middle East.   We think it must.11. The question of the nationality of the Allied Naval Commander &quot;-in-Chiefdid not really arise at this stage in the discussions.   The Chiefs of Staff foundedtheir case on the merits of the system they proposed.   Nevertheless it is our strong view that the command must be held by a British Admiral.12. Admiral Fechteler&apos;s object in coming to London was to have an exchange of views.   There is no doubt that, as a result of the discussions, he nowunderstands the British view, and he will report this to the United States    JointChiefs of Staff.   The next move must come from them.   I consider that we should stand firm on this matter.   I will report to the Cabinet any further developmentsthat take place.   In the meanwhile, no action will be taken in the Mediterraneanor elsewhere to compromise the position.Ministry of Defence, S.W.1.12th MAY, 1952.
