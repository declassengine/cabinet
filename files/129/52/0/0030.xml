C. (52) 180. , COPY NO^28th MAY, 1952.    .cabinet british BROADCASTING CORPORATION:APPOINTMENT OF GOVERNORSMemorandum by the Postmaster general in the White Paper on Broadcasting (cmd. 8550 - paragraph 18) theGovernment said that they proposed to recommend for the gracious considerationof The Queen that Governors of the British Broadcasting Corporation (B.B.C.)should in future be appointed and be removable by a Committee presided overby the Speaker of the House of Commons instead of, as at present, by Orderin Council.2.     In the debate in the House of Lords, Lord Listowel said that thisproposal was not accepted by the Party for which he was speaking that afternoon.   He argued that as there had been by common consent no politicalbias in appointments, a new safeguard was quite unnecessary and that thechange would diminish the ultimate control of Parliament over the B.B.C. since no Minister could be held responsible to Parliament for the appointments.He also argued that the inclusion of two judges would not assist in reflectingthe state of public opinion.3.      The proposal was at first supported by Lord Samuel who, however,said at the end of the debate that his opinion was not a considered one and didnot commit others.   Lord Halifax, in the light of the opposition of the LabourParty, felt that it was certainly not worth making a change of this sort inpresent circumstances.   Lord Waverley, Lord Jowitt and Lord Kenswood were also against a change.   In view of this weight of opinion we must considerwhether we should be wise in proceeding with this proposal without the assent of the Opposition, especially as the Leader of the Opposition was to be oneof the members of the committee.   There is also some weight in theconstitutional points made and the proposal does weaken the ultimate controlof the Government which rests on the power to dismiss Governors.4.       Left to myself I would propose that the plan for a Committee of appointment should be dropped and that Governors should continue to beappointed by the Crown on the advice of the Prime Minister.   I gather, however,that our back benchers feel strongly about this and perhaps the Chief Whipcan advise us on this point.   It might also be wise to ascertain the personal views of the Leader of the Opposition before taking a final decision.Post Office Headquarters, E.C.1.28th MAY, 1952.D.(3 CABINET office record COPY *(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIAL
