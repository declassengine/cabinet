CONFIDENTIAL CABINET OFFiGEc.(52)-i94 RECORD COPY copy no.Jo14TH JUNE, 1952CABINETOPENCAST COAL MINING:  EAST LOTHIANMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Co-ordinationof Transport, Fuel and Power and the Minister of fuel and power on 7th March the Home Affairs Committee agreed that prospecting foropencast coal should continue in East Lothian but that unless the Ministers conacerned were in agreement actual working of opencast coal should not be begunwithout reference to the Committee.   On 27th May the Cabinet, having beeninformed that a conflict of coal and agricultural interests was likely to arise,agreed that opencast coal should not be worked in East Lothian without the authorityof the Cabinet (C. C. (52) 56th Conclusions, Minute 4).2. Prospecting has now been completed of certain sites in East Lothianestimated to yield 632,000 tons of good coal worth between  1 and  2 millions overthe next three years.   We understand that the Secretary of State for Scotland is unable to agree to the working of this coal and a decision by the Cabinet is accordingly needed.3. The agricultural objection is to the requisitioning of 275 acres of high-quality agricultural land (of which 120 acres will be dug up) and to the loss ofa total of  90,000 -  100,000 worth of agricultural produce over the next seven years, which the Department of Agriculture for Scotland regard as the minimum period within which the site could be restored for moderate agricultural production.There would be a further loss, on which no figure can be set, if the land could not be restored to its present high level of fertility.   The quality of the land in the coastalstrip of East Lothian, in which the sites are located, is among the best, not only inScotland, but also in the United Kingdom.   Fertility, together with a high standard of farming and certain climatic advantages (the land near the coast is frost-free), has given this coastal strip a national, indeed an international, reputation and opencastoperations here would certainly result in public outcry.4. The coal case is that until the pits produce a good deal more deep-minedcoal than they are likely to produce in the next two or three years, a high level ofopencast coal production will be needed.   The coal in the East Lothian sites can be easily and quickly worked, and its loss could not be made good by more intensivework elsewhere.   Prospecting has been carried on in other coal-bearing areas inScotland, but no such find as in East Lothian Has been made.   Prospecting else-where is continuing but the prospect of other substantial finds is not good and in themeantime output must suffer if the coal in these sites is not to be worked.5. This in brief is the case on which a Cabinet decision is needed.We recognise the force of the objections of the Agriculture Ministers, and we no more relish than they do the idea of a public controversy on the matter, for one ofthe results of that might be to make it more difficult to get opencast sites in otherparts of the country, and that in its turn might cause a loss of coal output.
6. On the other hand, there is the fact that a decision not to workthese sites would, for a time at all events, reduce our coal supplies by20,000 tons a month and that if exports were reduced by a corresponding amountwe should be losing  60,000 or so a month in hard currency.   Moreover, sucha decision would virtually bar proposals for working neighbouring sites wherethe agricultural case will be just as strong as it is here, and in that event the sterilisation of opencast coal resources might be nearer 2 million tonsthan 1 million tons.   Our need for increased coal production is such that wecould not accept the agricultural view without our other colleagues having anopportunity to consider the matter.Li.G.L.14TH JUNE, 1952
