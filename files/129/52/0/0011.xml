Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1952SECRET-CABINET OF EHRECORD copy copy No.   7 3C. (52) 16113th May, 1952CABINETGERMANY: MANUFACTURE OF SHORT-RANGE GUIDED MISSILESMemorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs when the three Foreign Ministers discussed the control of German armamentsproduction with the Federal Chancellor in London in February, he agreed thatlong-range and guided missiles should, subject to definition, be included among those war materials which could not be made in exposed strategic areas of theEuropean Defence Community (i.e., Germany), except by the unanimous decisionof the E.D.C. Council of Ministers.2. Dr. Adenauer has now claimed the right to make short-range guided weapons, particularly for anti-aircraft defence, subject to the general armaments pro-duction procedure of the E.D.C. draft treaty (i.e., that such weapons should appear on List I, and not on List II). We have so far resisted this request., in accordancewith the conclusion of the Defence Committee on 30th April, on the grounds that(a) these very important weapons should not be made in an exposed area, where their factories might fall into enemy hands (so far as we know, the Russians havenot yet succeeded in making them nor have we and the Americans); and (b) if theGermans were allowed to make short-range weapons, they might be able compara-tively soon to make long-range weapons. We said that we would, however, beprepared to discuss means whereby the Germans could co-operate with the E.D.C.countries, the Americans and ourselves, in research regarding short-range guided missiles and their development, and consider German participation in theirmanufacture in a non-exposed area. German units in E.D.C. would get their share of such weapons wherever they might be produced.3. Early last week the Germans proposed that there should be a commonprogramme of research and development, with German participation in productionin a non-exposed area, to the apparent exclusion of all national programmes andon condition that short-range guided missiles should not be on the E.D.C. treatyList II, which is subject to unanimous decision of the E.D.C. Council of Ministers,but on List I. Later Dr. Adenauer was induced to agree to drop this latter condi-tion, but he continued to insist on a firm offer in writing for Western Germany toparticipate in joint research and development and manufacture in a non-exposedarea.4. The Americans want the Germans to develop short-range guided missiles,and do not wish them to be subject to unanimous decision by the E.D.C. Councilof Ministers. The &quot; common programme &quot; proposal would, I understand, prob-ably be acceptable to the French. Our position is more difficult, both technicallyand politically, for reasons set out below. There are four possible courses:  (a) To maintain our insistence that short-range weapons should not be madein exposed strategic areas (i.e., that they should be kept on List II ofthe E.D.C. draft treaty) and decline to enter into any form of commit-ment which might involve the United Kingdom in participation in a&quot; common programme.&quot;This line would almost certainly not be supported by the Americans,in which case it would be resisted by the Germans and a deadlockwould ensue.42256
2ib) To give Dr. Adenauer the written offer of a common programme as requested.I understand that the weight of technical opinion is against such a project on technical and security grounds, and that our importanttechnical exchanges with the United States on guided missiles might be stopped by the Americans, for security reasons, if we embarked on acommon programme with the E.D.C. countries.ic) To attempt to get Dr. Adenauer to agree that these weapons should notbe made in Germany except by unanimous E.D.C. Council of Ministers&apos;decision, but without making any offer to embark on a &quot; commonprogramme.&quot; Instead, we would only offer to enter into early dis-cussions with the E.D.C. countries (and the Americans) to try to workout a joint programme. This line might be justified on the grounds that we cannot enter into any firm commitment without technicalexamination and consideration with the other E.D.C. countries, whom we might undertake to approach.I am advised that Dr. Adenauer would be most unlikely to accept any offer on these lines, on the grounds that he needs a firm undertaking to satisfy his own public opinion, as he cannot give up the right to makethe most up-to-date weapons in Germany for the protection of his country against Russian air. attack, unless there is a commonprogramme.id) To agree that short-range guided weapons for anti-aircraft defence shouldbe removed from List II of the E.D.C. draft treaty, subject to very careful definition.I understand that there would be no serious technical or militaryobjection to this course. It is believed that the Germans are four yearsbehind the Russians, the Americans and ourselves, and that the riskin allowing them to try to make short-range guided weapons is, therefore,negligible. The Chiefs of Staff concluded at their meeting on 28th Aprilthat &quot; we had no alternative but to accept the German proposal, andshould therefore support the United States and accept the definitionwhich permitted guided missiles for anti-aircraft defence.&quot;5. The objections I see to course 4 id) are political and, if my colleaguesshare them, I see no alternative but to instruct Sir I. Kirkpatrick on the lines of4 ic) above. If this attempt fails, as it almost certainly will, we may have to fallback on course 4 id).A. E.Foreign Office, S.W. I,13 th May, 1952.
