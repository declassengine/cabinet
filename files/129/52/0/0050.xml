(52) 20*1) on certain special and urgentproblems relating to the supply of bacon, eggs and fats which arise in the papercirculated by the Chancellor (C. (52) 195).2. The main conclusions of this note may be briefly summarised asfollows:  (a) The most important single measure of the adequacy of the diet is itscalorie level. Food supplies should be sufficient to provide a national average of at least 2,900 calories per head per day. Below this figurethere are increasing risks of reductions in the growth rates of bothadults and children and/or of decreased activity, which would in turnbe reflected in lowered industrial productivity.(b) The calorie value of the food supplies in 1952, following the cuts in importsagreed in November 1951 and January 1952 is estimated at about 2,830.This is already below the 1947 level of 2,880, during which year therewas evidence of appreciable losses in weight in both adults and children.Any further reduction would, on the basis of our experience in 1941,involve increasing risks of &quot; impaired health and working efficiency.&quot;At a time when every effort is being made to increase industrial productivity, the potential bearing of this on the nation&apos;s economic position needs no elaboration. This reduction in calorie value is more serious than before the war when, whatever other nutritional deficienciesthere may have been, sufficient &quot; energy &quot; foods were available fairlycheaply.(c) Unless the diet is reasonably varied and palatable there is a risk that,irrespective of its calorie value, the amount of food consumed maynot be sufficient to maintain normal growth, to preserve morale andto secure a high standard of working efficiency. From this aspect the1952 pattern of consumption already compares unfavourably with thatof 1950 and still more with that of the pre-war years, indeed, for most of the more palatable and concentrated foods the levels of consumption will only slightly exceed those of the lowest pre-warincome group, and represent a reversion of the diet to a &quot;patterncomparable to that of about fifty years ago.3. My colleagues will realise that the statement we made against the lastGovernment, that the population is on a diet comparable with that of theunemployed pre-war, is in danger of being proved true now. I would ask mycolleagues to consider very earnestly whether, if our people are to maintain thestamina and energy needed for the great production effort which clearly lies beforethe nation, we can afford to consider the possibility of further cuts in our basic food.G.

NOTE   ON  METHODS   OF  ASSESSING THE  ADEQUACY   OF THE..:..................................     NATIONAL   DIET.....................1. Three main criteria* may be used to assess the adequacy of the nationaldiet-its/calorie value, its content of certain specific nutrients (notably of protein,mineral elements and vitamins), and its variety and acceptability.The Calorie Value of the Diet2. The outstanding importance of the calorie value of the diet has beenestablished from theoretical considerations, by experiments on individuals, byfeeding trials on selected groups of human subjects, and by observations of theeffects of varying calorie levels on the body weights of large samples of thepopulation.3. Theoretical considerations, confirmed by individual experiments, haveshown that an inadequate calorie level results either in a reduction in energy output(e.g., in muscular work and hence on a national scale in industrial productivity)or, if this is maintained, in a loss of bodyweight.4. This observation has since been strikingly confirmed in field tests carried outin Germany during the war. These tests showed that, by increasing the food supplyof a typical group of workmen by 500 calories per day, the rate at which theymoved debris was raised from 1 - 5 tons to 2 - 2 tons per hour, though the workers stillmaintained an average gain in bodyweight equivalent to about half a stone a year.Similar studies made with other groups of workers, notably Ruhr miners, showed that, failing such special incentives, work output fell as a result of cuts in the rations which reduced the calorie supply below the level needed to maintain bothoutput and bodyweight i.e., the workers unconsciously tended to reduce their output rather than incur bodyweight losses. The sponsors of the German studiesconcluded that &quot; rationing of food (below calorie requirements) also meansrationing industrial production.&quot;5. The practical problem is, however, not merely to determine what suchcalorie requirements are for the workers concerned, but to translate these intoterms of a national average designed to cover the needs of a population of widelydifferent ages and containing individuals whose occupations involve widely differinglevels of activity.6. Calculations from recognised tables of nutrient requirements, such asthose contained in the 1950 Report of the Committee on Nutrition of the british medical Association, indicate that after making allowances for losses betweenthe retail stage and the consumers plate the national requirement would workout at between 2,840 and 3,000 calories per head per day.7. The validity of these limits was supported by experience in the pre-warand early war years. Before the war the calorie level of the national diet wasabout 3,000. By 1940-41 food shortages had reduced this figure to about 2,800.In the Report on Food Consumption Levels prepared by a Joint Committee of the combined Food Board and published in 1944 the following comment is made(p. 37):-&quot; Some clue to the lower limit of supplies comes from United Kingdomexperience in the period of greatest stringency since the war began, viz., in early 1941. At that time supplies fell to an average of less than 2,700calories per head per day and although rationing was well established, therewere indications of impaired health and working efficiency. General experi-ence tends to show that while the current United Kingdom supply level is adequate, the slightly lower level in 1941 was less than adequate, though some allowance must be made for the rapidity with which consumption levels fell in1940-41. In other words the present supply level of about 2,800 calories per head per day is for the United Kingdom about marginal.&quot;8. At the time this Report was being prepared the Joint Committee did not possess any quantitative measure of the adequacy of the calorie level other than* Excluding criteria based on health indices, such as bodyweight changes, clinical examinationsand morbidity and mortality rates. But the requirement figures included in these notes are, of course,ultimately based on experimental and field observations of the relation of such indices to varying levels of food consumption.
&quot;indications of impaired health and working efficiency.&quot; This meant that the health of the population and industrial productivity were already menaced beforeremedial measures could be taken. In an attempt to provide an earlier and there-fore a less damaging indication of inadequacy the1 Ministry of Food had alreadyinitiated in 1943 a body weight survey, by means of which a continuing check couldbe made of the weight changes in a typical cross-section Of the adult population.This survey was continued until 1949. &apos;9. A recent analysis of the results of this survey reveals a most strikingparallel between calorie levels and bodyweight changes. Thus during 1944. whenthe calorie lever was about 3,000 per head per day, adult men and women showednormal slight annual increases in weight. , During 1945 when the calorie level was2,900, their weights remained roughly constant. During 1946 and early 1947, whenthe calorie level fell below 2,900, there were appreciable losses in weight. By 1948when the calorie level had again risen above 2,900, this regressive trend had beenreversed. It is significant to note that when the calorie level was just below 2,900,a differential weight loss was observed between those with and without canteenfacilities.10. These facts indicate that a calorie level of 2,900, rather than the figureof 2,800 suggested in the 1944 Report of the Joint Committee, probably represents the marginal level of energy requirements for this country. This view is supportedby observations on the growth rates of children, which in a number of areas showedsimilar trends to those noted for adults in the preceding paragraph.11. It therefore seems justifiable to conclude that, in order to maintain thenormal slight annual increases in the weight of adults and the satisfactory growth of children, a national average of at least 2,900 calories per head per day is required.Between 2,800 and 2,900 calories some weight will probably be lost if full workingefficiency is maintained. Between 2,700 and 2,800 calories there are increasingrisks of impaired health and reduced working efficiency.12. The bearing of these conclusions on the 1952 food procurementprogramme will be clear from an examination of the calorie levels shown in Table 1.The original programme would have provided an adequate level pf 2,990 calories.The cuts imposed in November 1951 reduced this to 2,850 calories, i.e., to a levelbelow that of 1947, at which weight losses occurred in both adults and children.The subsequent cuts imposed in January 1952 brought the figure to 2,830 calories,z.e\, to roughly the 1940-41 level. The further cuts proposed in March 1952 if effected, would have taken it below this level i.e:, to a figure approaching that atwhich there were &quot;indications of impaired health and working efficiency.&quot; At atime when every effort is being made to increase industrial productivity the potentialbearing of this on the country&apos;s economic position needs no elaboration.13. It is relevant to point out that any attempt to assess the adequacy of the1952 programme by relating it to the 1947 calorie level is of little significance whenit is appreciated that the latter was itself associated with loss of weight. :The Nutrient Content of the Diet14. Apart from the calorie level, some attention needs to be given to the adequacy of the protein content of the diet, though it is fair testate that noaccurate information is available regarding the exact protein requirements of man.Compared with the reductions in the calorie levels shown in Table .1, the fall inprotein is probably of minor significance, except in so far as it reflects a,reductionin the palatability and attractiveness of the diet. It is, nevertheless, relevant to note that the level of total protein in 1952 will be substantially lower than in. 1947(unless it is raised by increased bread consumption), and that the level of animalprotein does not give a true reflection of the difference between the pre-war andthe 1952 adult diet-since a considerably higher proportion of such protein is nowderived from liquid milk instead of from meat, cheese and other more solidadult foods... , .15. So long as present regulations regarding the composition&apos; of&apos;the: chiefstaple foods are maintained&quot; and so long as the present levels of supply, of milk,fruit and vegetables and of Welfare Foods are ensured and price levels are not raisedbeyond the purchasing power of the more vulnerable sections of the population,no special anxiety need be felt regarding the remaining nutrients.. ,:* e.g. the extraction level of wheat and the addition of vitamins to margarine.42426
Ministry of Food, S.W. 1,17th June, 1952.16. The adequacy, of a diet does not, however, depend solely on its calorievalue and nutrient content. The diet must be sufficiently varied and attractive toensure that it is eaten in adequate quantity! In this connexion it cannot be too strongly emphasised that lowering of morale and reduction in working efficiencyprecede the stage at which definite and continuing hunger is experienced. Moreover,many examples are available (particularly from experience in the services) of volun-tary reductions in food intake below essential calorie levels even in the midst ofplenty where the food was monotonous and unpalatable or even unfamiliar. It istherefore essential, if full working efficiency is to be maintained, to provide thepopulation with a reasonably varied and palatable diet.17. Table 2 shows the comparative patterns of the national diet in theimmediate pre-war years, in the two most stringent war years (1940 and 1941), in1947 and in 1950 the best post-war year, side by side with the most recent estimate for 1952. It has already been pointed out (paragraph 13) that comparisons with1947 cannot furnish valid evidence regarding the adequacy of the diet. The samepoint applies to comparisons with 1940 and 1941. Compared with 1950, and ofcourse even more strikingly with pre-war, the 1952 estimates show, however,reductions in most of the more attractive foods.18. To view these reductions in better perspective, two further tables havebeen prepared. Table 3 compares the 1952 estimates with the pre-war food con-sumption of six main income groups. Table 4 provides a similar comparison withthe general pre-war trends since 1880.19. From Table 3 it will be seen that in 1952 the estimated national averagelevels of consumption of meat, bacon, cheese, sugar and oils and fats will be not far removed from those of the lowest income group of the pre-war period, someof whom were unemployed, while others had to support disproportionately large families. Indeed, the only substantially higher figures in 1952 were those for eggs,for milk (desirable nutritionally, but not a stable adult food) and potatoes-onwhich supply statistics are in any event of doubtful accuracy.20. From Table 4 it will be seen that the 1952 estimates show similar unfavour-able comparisons with consumption trends since 1880. Total meat consumptionwill be well below and butter consumption roughly comparable with the estimated1880 figure. Cheese and sugar consumption will have reverted to the 1909 leveland fat consumption to the 1924 level. Indeed, the general pattern of the diet(particularly if, as may well be anticipated, the flour consumption increases in 1952above the 1950-51 level) will be comparable to that of fifty years ago except fora more liberal supply of eggs and (not shown in the table) a higher consumptionof milk.O.
