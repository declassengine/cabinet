Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1952SECRETCopy No. 62C. (52) 1529th May, 1952CABINET office record COPYCABINETGERMANYNote by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs am circulating for the information of my colleagues an interesting personal letter which I have received from M. Schuman and which sets out his views onthe tactics which we should employ in meeting the latest Russian proposals withregard to Germany.It seems to me that his mind is working on very much the same lines as ours.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,9th May, 1952.Translation of a Personal Letter from M. Robert Schuman to Mr. EdenYou were so good as to ask M. Massigli for my personal ideas on the presentsituation. I answer your request most willingly and will allow myself full and free expression of my views.The confusion which one finds existing everywhere in people&apos;s minds to-dayshows that the manoeuvre undertaken several weeks ago by the Russians has been more successful than was expected. We have perhaps depended too exclusivelyon the safeguard which we have in the incontestable sincerity and the personalauthority of the Federal Chancellor. It has, however, now been shown that neitherone nor the other have been sufficient to prevent a profound disquiet breakingout in the ranks of his coalition and even of his own party. German public opinion is wondering which road it should follow.As so often in the course of its history Germany finds itself faced with theproblem of its unity, a problem by which it is obsessed and which the russians have been able to make the prize of a supreme temptation to achieve immediateunification in return for certain postponements and certain questionable conditions.Into the bargain the Germans will not be sorry to free themselves somewhatfrom the too indiscreet insistence of the Allies and to benefit also, particularlyin the economic field, from a detente between East and West. Would it not be forthem an opportunity to resume an active and independent role ?.As for the Allies, they are attracted by the prospect, if not of obtaining a genuine and widespread detente, at least of avoiding an aggravation of the situationor even an irremediable conflict.All this disposes people towards conversations designed to reach a limitedunderstanding. J .Those responsible for our policy should not neglect any opportunity nor should they be the dupes of any trap. jIn the very first place we must examine the real intentions of our opponent.At present we are limiting ourselves to guessing them and to putting forward a. E.42247
2hypotheses. Why should we not put to him precise questions, from which he will find it impossible to escape, if necessary around a conference table ?The moment has come to bring into the light all ambiguities and traps designednot only for us but especially for the Germans. It is necessary that the latter should finally understand that the unity which is being offered to them entailsimportant unknown elements and undoubted servitudes.The Russian tempter has known how to concentrate all eyes on the freedomof all-German elections. This problem has indeed its importance, but it is notinsurmountable and I presume &quot;that the Russians will do everything necessary to achieve a solution if at this price they can bring about the creation ofa single German Government, which is to say the end of the Federal Govern-ment, enemy No. 1. Now what have we to show? Fine arguments destinedto make the elections impossible ? We shall lose the game in so far as the germans are concerned.  In any case, this is not the real problem.What is important is not so much to know by what procedure unity will beachieved as to define that unity itself. Even those Germans who are most fanaticaland most enamoured of unity must recognise that unity is not everything, thatunity subjected to servitude, that is to say to Russian control under whatever formit may be, might perhaps be for Eastern Germany a momentary alleviation but would be for Germany as a whole a step backards and a new surrender.It is this truth which must be made to shine out before the eyes of everyone.We must oblige the Russians to demonstrate it themselves. The clarifications forwhich we shall ask will put an end to their reluctance to speak, which up to nowhas veiled their contradictions.. One must at last find out under what regimeGermany would live if unified but occupied quadripartitely and without a peace treaty or any contractual agreement.To set up a single Government without assuring it beforehand of a modicumof freedom is to hand over Germany to Soviet manoeuvring and to paralysis. Wehave understood this; Germany will understand it, too, if we can find the wayto say it and to make it be said.In putting these questions insistently we shall act in the interest of germany as much as in our own. We shall widen the field of debate in transferring it toits proper ground, where resides the weakness of the adversary. We shall showup their swans as geese.Light will be shed on the true intentions of all. At the same time our relationswith Germany will be made more reasonable. We shall succeed in putting anend to certain reservations and distrust. We shall no longer have the attitudeof those who plead for unity as a tactical move while hoping that it will not come about. In the past our own egotistical preoccupations have appeared to be moreimportant to us than genuine search for common objectives. On the other hand,we shall cease to be the victims of a dangerous series of bidding in which thereis a risk that Germany will make us pay too dearly in an auction indefinitelydisputed or protracted.Germany must feel the whole weight of her own responsibilities. She willhave to choose not between integration with the West and German unity, whichwould be an impossible dilemma for her, but between unity which entails the guarantees of liberty offered by us and a unity subjected to quadripartite control.To sum up, Germany must be convinced that her true interest, even in thequest for her unity, is to stand in our ranks.I am happy to have been able to note that in all this business our views havebeen very similar. Your proposal for a reply constitutes an important step forward and could serve as a basis for discussion. If I have won you over to &quot;the ideasset out above it would only remain to make a few precisions in the text in orderto give them their full weight.Our tactics should no longer be defensive but offensive and open.Paris, 6th May, 1952.
