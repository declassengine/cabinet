RECORD COPY(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MA JEST Y&apos;S GOVERNMENT)CONFIDENTIALLC. (52) 169 COPY NO.21ST MAY, 1952CABINETTHE CONTIGUOUS ZONE. Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs a recommendation was recently made by the International law commission of the United Nations to the effect that member countries should recognise jurisdiction for certain purposes (particularly the enforcement of customs regulations) in a limited area, extending to about 12 miles from thecoast.   This area is known as the contiguous zone.   Jurisdiction would not includethe right to restrict fishing within it.2. Her Majesty&apos;s Government have in the past refused to recognise theprinciple of the contiguous zone.   However, with the approval of the Prime Ministerand after consultation with the Ministers mainly concerned (namely the Secretaryof State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power, the First Lord of theAdmiralty, the Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries and the Minister of Trans-port) it is now proposed to inform the International Law Commission thatHer Majesty&apos;s Government are prepared to accept their recommendation.3. The recommendation of the International Law Commission is moderate inits scope.   Moreover, if we, on our part, are prepared to concede the exerciseby coastal states of a limited degree of jurisdiction over contiguous zones, we maybe able to gain support, from other countries for the maintenance of three milesas the generally accepted limit to territorial waters.   This latter principle,which is important to the United Kingdom, is endangered by the general tendency to extend jurisdiction over the high seas..4. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and I are trying to enlist the support of the Commonwealth and certain foreign Governments for ourview about the maintenance of the three mile limit for territorial waters.A.E.Foreign Office, S.W.1.21st MAY, 1952.
