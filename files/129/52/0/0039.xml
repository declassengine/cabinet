Printed for the Cabinet.  June 1952CONFIDENTIAL Copy No. 6 3c (52) 189 CABINET OFFICEioth June, 1952 RECORD COPYCABINETFUTURE OF THE COUNCIL OF europe memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs my colleagues will recall that they approved the proposals contained in my memorandum C (52) 40 that the Council of Europe-in addition to performingits present functions should be reconstituted to permit the Committee of ministers and the Assembly to become institutions of the Schuman Plan, the european defence Community and any future European organisations with the same structure(C.C. (52) 30th Conclusions, Minute 3).2. I put forward those proposals at the tenth session of the Committee ofMinisters in Paris on 19th March. They were well received and, after a general discussion, were referred to the Deputies for detailed study. The results of this study, which were necessarily preliminary in character, were contained in a report which came before the Committee of Ministers at its eleventh session in Strasbourgon 22nd May. This report showed that there was a large measure of agreement on our proposals, but that certain differences of opinion existed on the questionsof timing and method of application, as well as some misapprehension about our intentions.3. The ensuing discussion in the Committee of Ministers, when I was able toelucidate our intentions, confirmed the favourable reception which the proposalsreceived when they were launched in March. A resolution was adopted approvingtheir underlying principle. It was also agreed that the Consultative Assembly andthe six Governments participating in the European Communities should be askedfor their views on the best means of giving effect to the proposals and that the deputies should continue to discuss the question in the light of these views.\ 4. The Consultative Assembly met from 26th to 30th June, when the british delegation was ably led by Mr. Anthony Nutting, M.P., Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. A general debate took place on our proposals,which were warmly welcomed by an overwhelming majority. The General AffairsCommittee has been instructed to study these proposals in detail and report back inSeptember.5. Our stock in Strasbourg now stands high. This is due to our initiative inlaunching proposals which have been accepted as proof of our willingness to estab-lish close political, as well as technical, links with the European Communities. If, as i hope, the proposals are translated into action, we shall have rounded off an awkwardangle and have brought our relations with the Council of Europe into line withour general policy of encouraging the movement towards federation in Europe andassociating the United Kingdom as closely as possible with it short of a merger.6. There are still difficulties to be overcome. For example, the swedish government are finding it difficult to reconcile a link between the Council of europe and the European Defence Community with their policy of neutrality. It should,however, be possible to find a solution which will enable Sweden to continue toparticipate in the work of the Council of Europe.A. E.IiForeign Office, S.W. 1,10th June, 1952.42387
