lotS CRET CABINET OFFICE:c.(52) 177 RECORD COPY copy no.    7/26th MAY, 1952.CABINETCHANGE IN THE DEFENCE PROGRAMME:MANPOWER IMPLICATIONSNote by the Minister of Labour and National Service..I wish to draw the attention of my colleagues to the difficulties with whichI shall be confronted in the manpower field if early decisions are not taken to end thepresent uncertainty about the size of the defence programme beyond 1952-53.   Iunderstand that this uncertainty creates equally serious problems for the service ministers and the Minister of Supply.2. In his memorandum C. (5 2) 173 on The Balance of Payments and the metal Using Industries the Chancellor says that &quot;we are likely to find it necessaryto reduce the defence load on the metal using industries by a substantial amount&quot;.Unless a decision is reached soon, on the size of the defence budget for 1953-54,there is a serious risk of aircraft and other armament contracts having to be cancelled and workers being discharged within the next few months.3. If this were to happen the result would be to jeopardise the wholebuild-up of the labour force for the aircraft firms.   The Notification of VacanciesOrder was introduced and accepted by both sides of industry largely in the belief that large numbers of additional workers&apos; would be required to carry out the aircraft programme and to man the Royal Ordnance Factories.   It was with the same sense of urgency that firms were encouraged to meet the scarcity of skilled workers &apos;by the development of schemes of upgrading and training.   If then, instead of being able to take in more workers, aircraft firms found themselves obliged to dischargelabour because contracts have to be cut back, the Government would be exposed tomost serious criticism for their failure to make timely plans on a firm andcoherent basis.   The effect on the aircraft industry in particular would be no lessunfortunate and tend to create such a sense of uncertainty of employment as to makeit difficult, if not impossible, at a future date to find workers who would be willingto go into the industry.4. At the last meeting of the National Joint Advisory Council questions were asked by representatives of the Engineering Employers&apos; Federation which showed that the absence of information about the impact of the defence programme is already causing considerable uneasiness among employers.5. There is another reason why it is important to reach an early decision;  this relates to the prospective unemployment situation.   The main reason for the rapid rise is unemployment in recent months has been the recession in textiles, but even if textiles are excluded, unemployment has only
fallen so far this year by 6,000, compared with an average fall of over50,000 over the last three years.   As unemployment normally rises duringthe second half of the year we must expect unemployment in the coming winter to be even higher than it is now, unless there is a substantial improvement in employment in textiles - and there is so far no sign of this.If this happens the Government will have to face a growing volume of criticism on this score.6. I recognise that decisions about the future size of the defence programme will have to be taken in the light of the general economic situationand particularly the shortage of steel, and that the balance of payments position may necessitate a reduction.   What I am, however, anxious toavoid is the development of a situation next winter in which the unemployment problem is aggravated by the engineering industry putting off workers or being unable to absorb unemployed workers from other industries because it is then engaged in the process of changing over from defence work to exports.   If this were to happen the critics would be given an obvious weaponwith which to attack the Government.   It is most important therefore thatif a decision involving a switch of this kind has to be taken, it should betaken in sufficient time to enable industry to make the necessary adjustmentsbefore the winter.W.M.Ministry of Labour and National Service, S.W.1.26th MAY, 1952.
