CONFIDENTIALQUESTIONS OF PROCEDURE FOR ministers. Cabinet ProcedurePreparation of Business for the Cabinet1.   The business of the Cabinet consists, in the main, of:  (i) Questions which engage the collective responsibility of the Government,either because they raise major issues of policy or because they arelikely to occasion public comment or criticism.(ii) Questions on which there is an unresolved conflict of interest between departments.All questions involving more than one Department should be examined inter-departmentally, before submission to Cabinet, so that the decisions required maybe clearly defined. When there is a conflict of interest between Departments, itshould not be referred to the Cabinet until all other means of resolving it have been exhausted, including personal correspondence or discussion between the ministers concerned.2. Proposals which involve expenditure or affect general financial or economic policy should be discussed with the Treasury and, if agreement cannot be reached between officials, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer before they are submittedto the Cabinet or to a Ministerial Committee; and the result of those discussions should be indicated in the memorandum.3. Matters which fall wholly within the Departmental responsibilitv of a singleMinister and do not engage the collective responsibility of the Government neednot be brought to Cabinet at all. A precise definition of such matters cannot begiven, and in borderline cases a Minister is well advised to bring the matter before his colleagues.4. These rules do not limit the right of Ministers to submit to the cabinet memoranda setting out their views on general issues of policy.5. When a Minister wishes to raise a matter orally at the Cabinet, the PrimeMinisters consent should be sought through the Secretary of the Cabinet.6. Memoranda for the Cabinet should be as brief and as clear as possible.Time spent in making a memorandum short and clear will be saved many times overin reading and in discussion; and it is the duty of Ministers to ensure that this is done by personal scrutiny and, where necessary, revision of memoranda submittedto them by their officials.The model memorandum explains at the outset what the problem is, indicatesbriefly the relevant considerations, and concludes with a precise statement of thedecisions sought. It is sometimes useful to include a summary of the main pointsbrought out in the body of the memorandum, but such a summary should neverexceed a few lines. Prefatory covering notes should be avoided. To facilitatereference in discussion, paragraphs should be numbered.If it is necessary to refer repeatedly to a body with a long title, an abbreviatedversion may be used if on the first mention the full title is given and the abbreviationadded in brackets, e.g., &quot; The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).&quot;7. Save with the Prime Minister^ permission, which will be granted only for reasons of extreme urgency, a memorandum may not be set down on the agenda for discussion by the Cabinet until two working days after it was circulated.8. Cabinet memoranda (as distinct from memoranda for Cabinet Committees)are normally reproduced by the Cabinet Office, the text being sent by the originatingDepartment to the Cabinet Office for the purpose. If for any reason a cabinet memorandum is reproduced by the originating Department, all copies should be sentto the Cabinet Office, and application should be made to the Cabinet Office for any additional copies required by the reproducing Department. The same rule applies.42034 b
to memoranda reproduced by Departments for consideration by Cabinet Com-mittees: all copies made should be sent to the Cabinet Office for circulation. :Tf.an originating Department so wishes, a standing arrangement may be made whereby the Cabinet Office will automatically supply for its use a fixed number of additionalcopies of memoranda.9. In no circumstances, other &quot;than those mentioned in the preceding para-graph, are Cabinet memoranda to be reproduced or copied in Departments. If a department requires additional copies of a memorandum, application must in every case be made to the Cabinet Office.Attendance at Cabinet .......10. Cabinet meetings take precedence over all other business. If a memberof the Cabinet, or a Minister summoned for a particular item, is. unable for any reason to be present at a Cabinet meeting, he should notify the Secretary, whowill inform the Prime Minister and will also consider whether any rearrangement of business is required.11. Ministers&apos; private secretaries can help the Secretary of the Cabinet byindicating, when asking for a subject to be placed on the Cabinefs Agenda, which ministers other than members of the Cabinet are likely to be concerned, so thatarrangements may be made for their attendance.12. The Prime Ministers Private Secretary is responsible for ensuring that theproceedings of the Cabinet are not disturbed. To assist him, Ministers should give instructions that messages are not to be sent to them while in Cabinet unless theyare so urgent that they cannot wait until the end of the meeting.     . 113. The Secretary should be informed of Ministers&apos; out-of-town engagements,and also of their, week-end and holiday arrangements so that, if some suddenemergency arises, he may be able to inform the Prime Minister at once which ministers are immediately available.Cabinet Conclusions14. The record of the Cabinefs proceedings is limited to the decisions taken and such summary of the discussion as may be necessary for the guidance of thosewho have to take action on them. The Secretary is under instructions to avoid,so far as practicable, recording the opinions expressed by particular Ministers.Matters of exceptional secrecy may be recorded in a Confidential Annex.15. Any suggestions for amendment of Cabinet Conclusions must reach theSecretary not later than the next day but one following that on which the meeting was held.   Thereafter the Conclusions will be sent to be printed.16. Ministers are responsible for giving such instructions to their departments as may be necessary to give effect to the Conclusions of the Cabinet, and for com-communicating to subordinate Departments or branches decisions of which they shouldbe made aware. Where an urgent matter arises in Cabinet unexpectedly, and adecision is reached requiring immediate action by a Department not represented at the meeting, the Secretary will ensure that the Department concerned is notifiedforthwith.17. When a Department has to take action upon, or is otherwise directly affected by, a particular Conclusion, the actual decisions of the Cabinet on that matter may be copied in the Department, together with so much of the record of thediscussion as is essential to a proper understanding of them, and these extracts maybe passed to responsible officers in the Department, as may be necessary. Thedistribution of such extracts within a Department should be limited to the occasions on which it is strictly necessary for the efficient discharge of public business, and care should be taken to see that extracts are sent only to those officers of the Depart-ment who need be acquainted with the actual terms of the decision. Where action has to be taken at once by a Department, application may be made to the Secretaryfor an advance copy of the relevant Conclusions.Return of Cabinet Documents- 18. Cabinet documents are the property of the Crown. Ministers relinquish-ing office should hand over to their successors those Cabinet documents which arerequired for current administration and should return all others to the Cabinet
Office. A former Minister may at any time have access in the Cabinet Office to copies of Cabinet or Cabinet Committee papers issued to him while in office..To facilitate the recovery of Cabinet and Cabinet Committee papers and toensure their safe custody Ministers are asked during their tenure of office to arrangefor the regular return to the Cabinet Office (at intervals of, say, three to six months)of such Cabinet documents as are not required for current administration.On a change of Government, the outgoing Prime Minister issues special instructions about the disposal of the Cabinet papers of his Administration.Cabinet Committees19. The procedure outlined above applies mutatis mutandis to ministerial committees of the Cabinet.While Committee meetings provide a useful forum for the discussion of policyand for enabling Ministers to ensure that their points of view are understood andto make a contribution to the formulation of policy, their prime object is thedespatch of business and the making of decisions. Attendance should be restricted to the permanent members and other Ministers who have a major interest in thequestion under discussion.Collective Responsibility20. Decisions reached by the Cabinet or Cabinet Committees are normallyannounced and defended by the Minister concerned as his own decisions. Theremay be rare occasions when it is desirable to emphasise the importance of some decision by stating specifically that it is the decision of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.This, however, should be the exception rather than the rule. The growth of anygeneral practice whereby decisions of the Cabinet or of Cabinet Committees were announced as such would lead to the embarrassing result that some decisions ofGovernment would be regarded as less authoritative than others. Critics of adecision reached by a particular Committee could press for its review by someother Committee or by the Cabinet, and the constitutional right of individual ministers to speak in the name of the Government as a whole would be impaired.21. The method adopted by Ministers for discussion among themselves of questions of policy is essentially a domestic matter, and is no concern of parliament or the public. The doctrine of collective responsibility of Ministers depends, inpractice, upon the existence of opportunities for free and frank discussion betweenthem, and such discussion is hampered if the processes by which it is carried onare laid bare. For these reasons it is also the general practice to avoid, so far aspossible, disclosing the composition and terms of reference of Cabinet Committeesand, in particular, the identity of their Chairmen.II. Precautions against Unauthorised Disclosures of Information22. Disclosures in the Press of matters under discussion by the Cabinet or its Committees damage the reputation of the Government and impair the efficiency of its administration.23. Ministers who share the collective responsibility for the governments programme must be kept generally aware of the development of important aspectsof Government policy. But outside this narrow circle knowledge of these matters should be confined to those, whether Ministers or officials, who are assisting inthe formulation or execution of the particular policy concerned, or need to know what is afoot because of its effect on other aspects of public business for whichthey are responsible.24. Government policy should not be discussed with persons outside Govern-ment service unless this is necessary for the transaction of public business. care should be taken to see that no discussions of Government policy are held in places where they may be overheard.25.   Ministers are personally responsible for ensuring that all members oftheir staffs understand the need for exercising the strictest discretion, and for seeing42034 B 2
that the appropriate precautions are strictly observed in their Department. Thefollowing considerations should be borne in mind:  (i) While it is within the discretion of Ministers to decide which of their advisers or subordinates should be shown Cabinet papers, the normal rule is that such papers should not be seen by any save their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy. In particular, cabinet papers should not be circulated as a matter of course to information officers or their staffs.(ii) A Minister who is a member of the Cabinet has responsibilities wider than those of his own Department, and will in that capacity receive some documents which are of no concern to any of his subordinates.(iii) A Parliamentary Private Secretary is not a member of the Government;and the information given to him should be correspondingly limited.Only exceptionally, and with the express authority of his Minister,should he be shown Cabinet or Cabinet Committee papers or othersecret official papers. The information given to him should be limitedto what is strictly necessary for the discharge of his Parliamentary andpolitical duties.(iv) Documents reflecting the personal views of Ministers are in a specialcategory, and their handling requires special care. It is contrary tothe doctrine of collective responsibility to make known the attitude of individual Ministers on matters of policy.(v) If occasions arise on which it is necessary that any considerable numberof officers should be consulted on particular issues arising out of cabinet memoranda, this should be done by means of minutes addressed to theofficers concerned, confined to the particular points on which they arerequired to advise, thus avoiding a wide circulation of the memorandathemselves.(vi) Experience has shown that leakages of information have often occurredas a result of the skilful piecing together, by representatives of the Press,of isolated scraps of information gathered from several sources, eachin itself apparently of little importance. The only safe rule is, there-fore, never to mention such matters even in the form of guardedallusions, except to those who must be informed of them for reasons ofState, until the time has come when disclosure, in whole or in part, is authorised. Reasons of State may require, in appropriate cases, the confidential communication of some information to a responsible editor,lobby correspondent, &amp;c, for purposes of guidance; but such communi-cation is only justified where it can be assured that the confidence andthe terms on which it is made are respected.26. Secrecy cannot, however, be secured solely by rules restricting the circu-lation of papers. Public business cannot be transacted without a fairly widedissemination of confidential information within Government circles, and theessential need is for the observance of a high standard of discretion by all whoacquire knowledge of such information in the course of their duties an attitude of mind which puts first the interests of the Government as a whole and subordinateseverything to that end. It is the duty of Ministers to set this standard of discretion in regard to all confidential matters which come within their knowledge, to give an example to others, and to see that their example is followed.III. Ministerial Speeches, Broadcasts, &amp;c.27. In public speeches Ministers should exercise special care in referring tosubjects which are the responsibility of other Ministers. They should keep withinthe ambit of approved Government policy, and should not anticipate decisions notyet made public.   In all cases of doubt they should consult the Minister concerned.28. The Foreign Office should always be consulted before any mention is madeof matters affecting foreign affairs or relations with foreign Powers; and Ministerswishing to refer to matters of defence policy should in all cases first consult theMinister of Defence.   Ministers should also be specially careful in referring to
matters affecting our relations with self-governing Commonwealth countries, or tothe political aspects of Colonial affairs (e.g., self-government in certain Colonies)and on these points should consult the Commonwealth Secretary or colonial secretary respectively, unless the matter to be mentioned falls wholly within theirown responsibility.29. In the present international situation special care is needed in conver-sations at social functions at Embassies or at other functions at which foreigndiplomatic representatives are present. If matters of foreign policy are discussed at such functions, a note should be made afterwards of the salient points of the conversation and a copy sent to the Foreign Secretary.30. Unless they have first obtained the agreement of the Leader of the Houseof Commons, Ministers should avoid saying anything which might affect the pro-gramme of Government business in Parliament. Thus, they should not without his agreement promise White Papers, the publication of which might result in a demandfor a special debate; and legislation should never be promised without the expressapproval of the Cabinet or the Legislation Committee.By-Elections and Local Government Elections31. Members of the Cabinet should not normally speak at By-Elections; but other Ministers, including those of Cabinet rank, may do so. As a general ruleMinisters above the rank of Parliamentary Secretary should not speak at localgovernment elections. There may, however, be occasions on which a Minister may feel obliged to do so for special reasons, particularly in his own constituency.Broadcasting Arrangements32. Ministers intending to broadcast should communicate with thePostmaster-General, who will be responsible for obtaining the Prime Minister^approval and for making the necessary arrangements with the B.B.C. As broad-casts by Ministers may be regarded by the B.B.C. or by the Opposition ascontroversial and therefore giving a claim to a reply, the subject of the broadcastmust in all cases be given and the Prime Minister may require to see either an outline or the text of a broadcast before giving his approval.33. Broadcasting by sound and by television is a useful instrument for con-surveying the British point of view to people in other countries. But before Ministerscommit themselves to making broadcasts over foreign wireless systems they should first consult the Foreign Secretary and any other Minister who may be concernedwith the subject of the broadcast. They should then seek the permission of thePrime Minister.If Ministers are invited to broadcast while on a visit to another country theyshould seek the advice of Her Majesty&apos;s representative in that country beforeaccepting the invitation.IV. Press Articles and Interviews by MinistersPress Articles34.   Ministers are precluded from the practice of journalism in any form;but this prohibition does not extend to authorship or to writings of a literary,.historical, scientific, philosophical or romantic character.    For these there are numerous and respectable precedents.35. This rule need not be interpreted as debarring a Minister from con-tributing an article or a letter to a newspaper, on occasion, for the purpose of supplementing other means of informing the public about the work of his Depart-ment. In deciding whether to do this, a Minister should bear in mind his obligations to Parliament: for example, he should not discuss a Bill before it has received its second Reading in the House of Commons. Ministers should not accept payment for such articles.36.   This rule governs dealings with the foreign as well as the home Press.Party Publications37. The rule in paragraph 34 does not debar Ministers from contributing tothe publications of the political organisations with which they are associated.Payment should not be accepted for such articles.
Interviews38. A Minister may decide in his discretion whether he should grant specialinterviews to individual Press representatives, bearing in mind that an interviewgranted to a representative of a single newspaper or agency may arouse jealousyin the rest of the Press. As a general rule, the same considerations apply to inter-views as to written articles (see paragraph 35 above).V. Parliamentary Private Secretaries39. Parliamentary Private Secretaries occupy a special position which is not always understood by the general public, either at home or abroad. They arenot members of the Government, and should be careful to avoid being spoken of as such. They are Private Members, and should therefore be afforded as great a liberty of action as possible; but their close and confidential association with ministers necessarily imposes certain obligations on them, and has led to thegenerally accepted practice set out in the following paragraph.40. Parliamentary Private Secretaries should not make statements in theHouse or put Questions on matters affecting the Department with which they are connected. They should also exercise great discretion in any speeches or broadcastswhich they may make outside the House, taking care not to make statements which appear to be made in an official or semi-official capacity, and bearing in mind atthe same time that, however careful they may be to make it clear that they arespeaking only as Private Members, they are, nevertheless, liable to be regarded asspeaking with some of the authority which attaches to a member of the Govern-ment. Generally they must act with a sense of responsibility and with discretion;and they must not associate themselves with particular groups advocating specialpolicies.VI. Absence of Ministers from the United Kingdom41. Any Minister who is a member of the Cabinet or is in charge of a Depart-ment should obtain The Queen&apos;s permission to be absent from the United Kingdom,whether on duty or on leave, and should inform Her Majesty what arrangements are to be made for the administration of his office during his absence. such arrangements should have the prior approval of the Prime Minister.Other Ministers who propose to leave the United Kingdom, whether on duty or on leave, need not obtain The Queen&apos;s permission to do so. They should,however, obtain the consent of their own Minister and of the Prime Minister.Any Minister who proposes to visit a foreign country should consult theForeign Secretary, before seeking the Prime Ministers consent; and a minister who proposes to visit another part of the Commonwealth should similarly consult the Commonwealth Secretary (if the visit is to a self-governing commonwealth country or to the High Commission territories in South Africa) or the colonial secretary. Ministers proposing to visit the Irish Republic, even on holiday, should first consult the Commonwealth Secretary.42. When a Minister is to be away from London, his Parliamentary secretary will normally take Ministerial charge of the Department. On some occasions,however, it may be desirable that arrangements should be made for another minister of Cabinet rank to hold himself available to give political guidance to officials of the Department and to represent the Departments interests in dis-cussions in Cabinet or Cabinet Committees. Any such arrangements, if notinitiated by the Prime Minister, should have his prior approval.When one Minister of Cabinet rank is acting in this way on behalf of another,special care must be taken over the exercise of statutory powers. With someexceptions the powers of a Secretary of State can be exercised by another Secretaryof State; and the powers of a Board or Council may be exercisable in the absenceof its principal member. But for the most part the powers of a Minister cannotbe exercised by a Minister in charge of another Department; and a Minister who is acting for an absent colleague should be careful to avoid appearing formally toexercise powers which are expressed by statute as exercisable by his colleague.There is no similar difficulty about submissions to Her Majesty. Submissionsmade in the absence of a Minister should be made by his Parliamentary
Secretary if he is a Privy Counsellor; if he is not, they may be made by another minister of Cabinet rank. Submissions on behalf of an absent Secretary of state must be made by another Secretary of State. Submissions on behalf of the FirstLord of the Admiralty may be made in his absence by the Senior lord commissioner.43. Occasional visits by Ministers to territories and services overseas forwhich they are responsible (e.g., a visit by a Colonial Office Minister to a Colonyor by an Admiralty Minister to a Royal Naval establishment overseas) may properly be charged to public funds. Ministers should not, however, charge to public fundsthe cost of visits to other countries made for the purpose of observing the workingof a Government service abroad analogous to that for which they are responsible in the United Kingdom.VII. Parliamentary Statements and PapersStatements after Questions44. When Parliament is in session important announcements of government policy should be made, in the first instance, in Parliament. But, if too manyannouncements are made at the end of Questions, Parliamentary business is impededand important statements may not receive adequate publicity in the Press.Ministers proposing to made a statement after Questions, whether or not related toa Question on the Order Paper, or to answer at the end of Questions a Questionwhich is not likely to be reached, are therefore asked to conform with the following procedure:  (a) The earliest possible notice should be given to the Prime Minister^ private secretary, who will consult as necessary with the Leader of the Houseof Commons and with the Chief Whip. Particulars should be given ofthe subject matter of the proposed statement, the date on which it is desired to make it, and the grounds for making it on that date and foradopting this method of announcement. It should also be statedwhether the announcement has been approved by the Cabinet or by oneof its Committees.(b) Copies of the draft statement should be sent as soon as it is available tothe Prime Minister, to the Leader of the House of Commons and to theChief Whip. These copies should arrive not later than 10 a.m. on theday on which the statement is to be made.(c) It is at times desirable that a copy of such a statement should be shown to the Opposition shortly before it is made. If this is desired, a copyof the final text should reach the office of the Chief Whip in the Houseof Commons as early as possible&apos; and in any case not later than 2 p.m.on the day on which the statement is to be made.(d) A copy of the final text should in all cases be sent to the Speaker.(e) It may sometimes be expedient that a corresponding statement should bemade simultaneously in the House of Lords. Ministers should, where necessary, consult the Leader of the House of Lords on this point.Publication of White Papers45. Similar considerations apply to the publication of White Papers, particu-larly as regards the avoidance of simultaneous publication of White Papers forwhich it is desired to obtain publicity. Ministers are therefore asked, even thoughthe publication of a White Paper may have been approved by the Cabinet, to applyto White Papers the procedure laid down for statements after Questions in para-graph 44/above.46. Care must be taken to avoid any possibility of an infringement of Parlia-mentary privilege when publicity arrangements are made for White Papers. the accepted practice is for final revised proof copies of White Papers to be madeavailable to Lobby correspondents somewhat in advance of their being laid in the vote Office and for Ministers to hold a Lobby Conference if they think it desirable.The Prime Ministers Adviser on Public Relations should be consulted if there is any question of a wider advance distribution than this. Such wider distribution e.g., to industrial correspondents is to be avoided save in exceptional circumstances.
