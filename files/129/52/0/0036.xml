secret. (52) 186 COPY NO.   M10TH JUNE, 1952 CABINETSUPPLEMENTARY PENSIONS scheme memorandum by the Minister of Labour and national service the Cabinet at their meeting on 8th May (C. C. (52) 51st Conclusions,Minute 8) authorised me to consult the Trades Union Congress (T. U. C.) about thepossibility of a wider inquiry into the long-term economic and financial aspects ofthe growing cost of making adequate provision for old age, with particular referenceto schemes, both State and otherwise, for retirement and old age pensions.   In doing so I was to ensure that there was no misunderstanding about the limited significance of any approval that may be given to pensions schemes that had reached an advanced stage of consideration.(   )2. I have seen Mr. Arthur Deakin and Sir Vincent Tewson, but they are notprepared to co-operate or assist in any such inquiry.   They regard the widerinquiry as a camouflage to cover up an inquiry into supplementary pensions schemes and thus prevent them from bringing to fruition a number of schemes on which negotiations are well advanced.   They are obviously still very sore about the tacticsemployed by the previous Government.3. We must now decide whether or not to go ahead with the inquiry.   I see no advantage in having a head-on collision with the T. U. C. on this matter.   Moreover,while the extension of schemes for supplementary pensions might have serious repercussions throughout industry, I also see no advantage in the circumstances ofpursuing the policy initiated by the Labour Government.4. I suggest that we should give up the idea of inquiring on the above lines andappoint a Committee to report to us the facts about making adequate provisionfor old age, which might take the form either of an ad hoc interdepartmental committee of officials or a Committee appointed within the framework Of the national insurance scheme.   We should then be able to go to the various organisations concerned, including the T. U. C. , on an informwbasis and after this consultationwe co\ild formulate our own policy.   In the meantime, we shall have to deal ontheir merits with proposals formulated in the different industries as a result of negotiation with the Trade Unions and Staff Associations.W.M.Ministry of Labour and NationalService, S.
