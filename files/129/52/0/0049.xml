confidential.(52)199JUNE 17, 1952BUILDING LICENSING LIMITS:  REVIEW OFTHE CONTROL OF BUILDING OPERATIONS order memorandum by the Minister of WorksOn instructions from the Prime Minister I draw my colleagues&apos;attention to my memorandum B. (52) 24 recommending changes in the buildinglicensing limits.   My proposals were:-(l)   To change the licensing period to a calendar year.(2)   For the eighteen months ending December, 1953, to fix the free limitsas follows(a) industrial and agricultural buildings:    1,000, of which not morethan  500 to be carried out in July/December, 1952,(b) housing and other building wck:    500, of which not more than 100 to be carried out in July/December, 1952.(3)   To discuss with the Local Authority Associations the question of winding up their agency work other than on new housing.2. The Building Committee at its meeting on 26th May felt that theseproposals might divert labour and materials from new construction and create a bad impression when we are cutting down in other directions,   I was invitedto reconsider the proposals and to submit them to the Economic PolicyCommittee.CABINET OFFICE /pp f) P n  C O P Y 6/KtH^UttU   UUl   i COPY NO.cabinet. In submitting my proposals to the Economic Policy Committee(E. A. (52) 73), I saw no reason to change my view that the increased freedomwhich I recommended would give a fillip to the building industry and would notadversely affect the Housing Programme.4. The Economic Policy Committee felt that it would be wiser to defer fora short time any substantial increase in the licensing limits.   I was invited toconsider three possible alternatives and submit them to the Building Committee.5. These alternatives were:-(a)  that the present free limits of  500 for industrial and agricultural(i. e. designated) buildings and  100 for all other work done on privateaccount should be continued for a further twelve months.   But when thedecision was made public I should state the Governments intentionto review the position before the end of the year, and our policy of operating the licensing system in the meantime in accordancewith local needs.
(b)   same as (a) but with  200 in place of  100 for houses and other non-designated buildings.(c)  that the new Order should operate for six months only and the limitsbe fixed at  500 for designated building and  100 for non-designatedbuildings for that period.6. I strongly recommended proposal (b) and the Committee approvedthis, and in the light of the arguments used I was satisfied with the decision.7. The new licensing period begins on 1st July and I must make my Ordevery soon. I should, therefore, be glad to have Cabinet approval to the courseagreed by the Building Committee.D.E.Ministry of Works, S.E.1. ,JUNE 17, 1952.
