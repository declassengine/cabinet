Broadcasting: Memorandum on the Reportof the Broadcasting Committee, 19491. The Charter granted to the British Broadcasting Corporation on1st January, 1947, and the accompanying Licence dated 29th November, 1946,were due to expire soon after the Government took office. To allow time forthe conditions of a new longer-term Charter to be examined and for theproposals to be considered by Parliament, a short-term Charter was granted for six months to expire on 30th June, 1952. A new Licence covering thisperiod was also issued.   (Cmd. 6974, 6975, 8416 and 8417 refer.)2. The Government have considered the recommendations of the Broad-casting Committee which sat under the Chairmanship of Lord Beveridge(Cmd. 8116 and 8117). They have taken into account the proposals of thelate Government set out in a White Paper issued in July 1951 (Cmd. 8291)and the views expressed in the subsequent debates in both Houses ofParliament.3. The following proposals which the Government now make in regardto the new Charter and Licence are set out for the consideration of Parlia-ment under the main heads of the Broadcasting Committee&apos;s Report. Inmany instances the Government accept, as did their predecessors, therecommendations of the Broadcasting Committee, but in certain respects thevhave felt bound to propose alternative arrangements.I.-RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO CONSTITUTION AND POWERSOF BROADCASTING authority the questions of the monopoly and sponsored broadcasting4. The successive Licences granted to the B.B.C. have not of themselvesestablished the Corporation as the sole authority for all broadcasting in theUnited Kingdom. The Corporation have, in fact, enjoyed an exclusiveprivilege because successive Governments have decided that, although thePostmaster General is empowered by statute to license any number of persons to operate broadcasting stations, he should not license anyone other thanthe B.B.C.5. The Government recognise that this effective monopoly has done muchto establish the excellent and reputable broadcasting service for which GreatBritain is renowned and that the B.B.C. have become an important part ofthe structure of our national life. Their services must remain intact and theCorporation should be the only broadcasting organisation having any claim onthe revenue from broadcasting receiving licences. The new Charter andLicence which are to come into force on 1st July next will therefore provide forthe B.B.C. to continue broadly on the existing basis. The Government wouldbe most unwilling to see any change in the policy of the B.B.C. themselvestowards sponsoring or accepting advertisements, and the existing restriction on commercial broadcasting without the consent of the Postmaster General willbe preserved. Some additional safeguards will be incorporated to avoid thepossibility that the Corporation might be subordinated to political ends. TheGovernment accept the Broadcasting Committee&apos;s recommendation that the
Corporation^ current independence in making programmes and in general administration should be continued.6. The question whether broadcasting in the United Kingdom shouldcontinue to be entrusted solely to the B.B.C. has much exercised the minds of all who have considered it. The late Government accepted the majorityrecommendation by the Broadcasting Committee that the Corporation shouldbe continued as the authority responsible for all broadcasting, includingtelevision. The recommendation that the Government should expresslyreserve power to license, after consultation with the B.B.C., public authorities or approved organisations to maintain and conduct local stations for sound broadcasting was, however, noted as a matter which depended on the futureof very high frequency broadcasting and which could only be decided in thecircumstances at the time.7. The present Government have come to the conclusion that in the expanding field of television provision might well be made to permit someelement of competition when the calls on capital resources at present needed for purposes of greater national importance make this feasible. They donot therefore propose to ask Parliament to commit themselves to the continuation of the exclusive privilege of the B.B.C. in this field.8. As the policy governing the B.B.C. Charter and Licence is alwaysconsidered by Parliament on the occasion of renewal, the Government thinkthat Parliament should have a similar opportunity of considering before the licensing of the first station the terms and conditions under which competitivetelevision might operate.9. It would be necessary to introduce safeguards against possible abuses,and a controlling body would be required to regulate the conduct of the newstations, to exercise a general oversight of the programmes and to advise onappropriate matters; the new stations would not be permitted to engage in political or religious broadcasting. Licences for any new stations would begranted (and, if necessary, withdrawn) by the Postmaster-General on theadvice of this body, subject to reservation by the Government of all rights intime of emergency. The establishment of this body and consideration of itsdetailed functions will be deferred until nearer the time when it would bepossible to license new stations.10. The licensing of other bodies or persons to broadcast television programmes for reception in the home would involve the use of the higherfrequencies. On technical aspects, the Government will continue to seekadvice from the Advisory Committee concerned with the development of television generally (see paragraph 28). It must be noted that the establish-ment of new television services would require new stations and their ancillary services, such as studios, and that the radio industry would require to begiven well in advance the technical information necessary to enable them to design and produce adaptors for existing television sets and new receiverscapable of picking up either the B.B.C. programmes or those on the higherfrequencies.11. For many years the B.B.C. have been prevented by limitations on capital investment from developing television in certain areas and from introducing very high frequency sound broadcasting. The Government con-sider that the B.B.C. have a continuing obligation to provide adequatenational broadcasting services throughout the United Kingdom, and the fulfilment of this policy must clearly have first claim when labour and materials become available.
( Jterms of renewal of the charter12. The Government think that the practice of granting a Charter fora limited period should be continued because of the changes that may be.expected to accompany the development of the higher frequencies, and they feel that a ten-year term would be appropriate for the next Charter. If the charter is limited to this period, the Government see no need to providespecifically for the holding of periodic reviews on the lines proposed by the broadcasting Committee in relation to a Charter without a specific time limit.13. The Government agree with the Broadcasting Committee that the charter should specifically require the Corporation to take such steps as may appear to them necessary to meet certain prescribed aims. Provision willbe made in the Charter requiring the Corporation to keep their work under constant and effective examination (see also paragraph 36 below).1.4. The Charter will also require the Corporation to give the staff a means of discussing by representative organisations questions about their terms and conditions of employment, matters affecting their safety, health and welfare, and other matters of mutual interest, including efficiency in theoperation of the Corporation^ services. The Government understand that,since the Broadcasting Committee reported, the Corporation and the B.B.C.Staff Association have accepted the Broadcasting Committee&apos;s Recommenda-tion Number 93. The Corporation have been in consultation with theTrades Union Congress and some of the individual unions concerned, and negotiations are continuing. The Government hope that a satisfactory solution to this complex and difficult problem will soon be achieved.15. The new Charter will require the Corporation to delegate to Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland and to the English Regions powers which will afford them a reasonable measure of independence and greater variety and initiative in respect of programmes. The Charter will make it clear that itis a duty of the Corporation to develop their television service with due regard to its special problems and to develop higher frequency sound broadcasting. The rate of development must, necessarily, take account ofthe national economic situation and the many calls upon resources, bothnow and in the future.16. On minor issues affecting the Charter and Licence the government accept the recommendations of the Broadcasting Committee on the followingpoints: -(i) that the Corporation should no longer be bound by the opinion oftheir auditors as to the provision to be made for depreciation theGovernment would, however, expect that auditors would be consulted in the matter;(ii) that freer delegation of power to sign documents on behalf of theCorporation should be permitted;(iii) that Advisory Councils or Committees appointed by the B.B.C. orby the Broadcasting Councils (see paragraph 21 below) should beempowered to appoint sub-committees;(iv) that the Postmaster General&apos;s approval should continue to be requiredto the organising by the Corporation of public concerts or other public entertainments, the word &quot; public&quot; being defined in this connexion as relating to audiences paying for admission.The Government propose to amend the Licence in respect of the power ofGovernment departments to require the B.B.C. to broadcast &quot; any announce-metttor other matter.&quot; The power respecting &quot;announcements&quot; would continue as at present but would be understood to include an image of a
picture or an object accompanying a spoken announcement in the television service. The power respecting &quot;other matter &quot; would be restricted to periods of emergency. The power of the Government, if they should prohibit anybroadcast, to prohibit also any announcement that a veto has been imposedwill be revised, so as to leave it to the discretion of the Governors of theCorporation whether or not to announce that a veto has been imposed.governors of the corporation17. The Government agree with the Broadcasting Committee that theposition of the Governors should be denned only by the Charter; the &quot; WhitleyDocument,&quot; in which their duties and responsibilities have been defined, will accordingly disappear. Within the framework of the Charter the Governorscollectively will have unrestricted authority and power of decision, though theChairman should have the recognised right of making emergency decisions,subject to report to the Board.18. Hitherto the Governors have been appointed and have been liable tobe removed by Order in Council, the Crown having in practice been advisedin these matters by the Government of the day. The Broadcasting committee did not recommend any change in the method of appointing the Board, butthe Government consider it to be desirable that the appointment or removalof the Governors should be taken as far as possible from the political arenaas a safeguard against any risk that the Corporation might be subordinated to political ends. The Government accordingly propose to recommend for her majesty&apos;s gracious consideration that the Governors should no longer beappointed and be removable by Order in Council but that the new Chartershould provide that these powers should be devolved to a Committee consistingof the holders for the time being of the following Offices, provided they are willing to serve in this capacity: The Speaker of the House of Commons, who would be the Chairman;The Prime Minister;The Leader of the Opposition;The Lord Chief Justice of England;The Lord President of the Court of Session.19. In consequence of the proposals regarding broadcasting councils(see paragraph 22 below) the size of the Board will be increased from sevento nine to include &quot; national&quot; Governors in close touch with opinion inScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Government think that it would materially assist their representative function if the Governors were to meetperiodically in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and the charter will provide accordingly. In other respects the Charter will maintainthe present freedom of the Governors to conduct their business. the governors will as now be free to appoint committees for any purpose,subject to ratification by the Corporation as a whole of any conclusion of acommittee. Provision will be made to permit the committees to includepersons who are not members of the Corporation. The Government considerthat the executive responsibility for day to day management of the corporation should rest with the Director General; they propose, therefore, to continue the reference in the Charter to this office. To meet the possibility that the governors might wish at some time to have more than one Director General(for example, during the war there were Joint Directors General) the charter will be in terms which would permit this and, if the Governors so decide,one or more Assistant Directors General.20. The Government agree that Governors should be required to give only part of their time to the Corporation and that the Chairman should542092 B 2
normally make his duties to the Corporation his first interest. The present practice under which a Governor is specifically appointed Vice-Chairman will&apos;continue. The Government see no good reason for departing from thepresent term of office of five years. Reappointments will be provided for,but no Governor will be regarded as having a prescriptive right to bereappointed. The dates of retirement of the members of the Board will, asat present, be staggered. The existing salaries of the Governors will beretained; namely, Chairman,  3,000 a year; Vice-Chairman  1,000; other&quot; ordinary &quot; Governors,  600. Those Governors who are also Chairmen ofthe Broadcasting Councils in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will receive  1,000 a year. The initial salaries will be specified in the Charter,but a power of variation will be taken.broadcasting councils21. The Government agree with their predecessors about the importanceattaching to the greatest possible devolution to all areas of authority onprogramme policy and other matters. This applies particularly to Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland with their own distinctive national characteristics.The Government agree in principle with the Broadcasting Committee&apos;recommendation that there should be &quot; national&quot; bodies, and the charter will establish Broadcasting Councils for the three countries, provided that theGovernment of Northern Ireland agree so far as that country is concerned.As recommended by the Broadcasting Committee, the Government will leave to the Corporation the detailed definition of the powers to be delegated tothe national bodies. Subject, however, to such reservations as may be madeby the Governors for the purpose of ensuring co-ordination and smoothadministration of the machine, the primary functions of the councils will beto control the policy and content of their Home Service programmes within any obligations imposed on the B.B.C. by the Charter and Licence and thearrangements made for party political broadcasts. The Councils will beresponsible for the appointment of staff wholly employed in connection withthe Home Service programmes. Overall responsibility for finance and thecontrol of capital development will rest with the Corporation, and in thesematters the functions of the Councils j will be advisory.22. The composition of the Broadcasting Councils has aroused consider -able Parliamentary and public interest. The Government favour medium-sizedCouncils and propose that under the Chairmanship of the &quot; national&quot;Governors there should be eight members formally appointed by the Corpora-tion but selected for appointment by a panel of the B.B.C. General AdvisoryCouncil nominated by that body. Three of the members of the broadcasting councils for Scotland and Wales would be drawn from panels representativeof local authorities; the remaining five would be appointed after con-sultation with representative cultural, religious and other bodies. TheGovernment of Northern Ireland will be consulted about the arrangementsthere. The members of the Councils would be unpaid. As the appointmentof a General Advisory Council is not at present obligatory, the new Charterwould lay an obligation on the Corporation to appoint a Council of arepresentative character of not less than thirty and not more than fiftymembers.23. The Government accept the Broadcasting Committee&apos;s recommenda-tion that the Advisory Councils for the English Regions should continueto be appointed by the B.B.C.; they understand that the Corporation are giving effect to the recommendation that these Councils should be made more representative and should have power to appoint sub-committees.   The
Government agree that it will help the work of the Councils if, as is contem-plated, the Chairman of Governors or one of his colleagues can arrange to be present at the meetings from time to time.24. The Broadcasting Committee pointed out (paragraph 523 of theirReport) that in respect of the Home Service the Regional Controller has nowconstitutionally all but complete programme autonomy. The Governmentunderstand that, since the Broadcasting Committee reported, the Governorshave devolved authority to the Directors of the various Services and that the regional Controllers are soon to be put in a similar position.ministerial responsibility25. The Government agree that there should be no Minister for Broad-casting as such. The Postmaster General will continue to be responsiblefor the exercise of the Government^ powers. It is proposed that the PrimeMinister shall designate a Senior Minister to deal with major matters of broad-casting policy on his behalf, unless the matter at issue is clearly within theprovince of one of his Ministerial colleagues.II.-OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS FOR ACTION BY her majesty&apos;S government financial questions26. The Government agree broadly with their predecessors&apos; views on financial questions affecting the B.B.C.  In summary these are:  (a) the licence fee system will be continued to meet the cost of homebroadcasting;ib) the B.B.C. will receive a definite percentage of the net licence revenue,and this percentage will not be changed without adequate notice. TheLicence will continue to leave the B.B.C. free to make representations to the Postmaster General at any time that the percentage should beincreased;(c) the Corporation will receive 85 per cent, of the net licence revenue for the first three years of the new Charter;id) the Corporation will be authorised, with the consent of the PostmasterGeneral, to borrow up to  10,000,000 for capital expenditure;(e) the cost of the Overseas Services (revenue and capital expenditure)will continue to be borne by a Grant in Aid from the Exchequer. Thecost will be calculated as the definable additional expenditure incurred on account of the Overseas Services;if) the B.B.C. Annual Report and Accounts should include information on such matters, financial or otherwise, as may be prescribed by theGovernment after consultation with the Corporation. The charter will also provide for the furnishing of reports by the broadcasting councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.27. The present division of responsibility between the Government andthe Corporation for the Overseas Services will continue.b.b.c. television service28. The new Licence will be modified to ensure that within the sphere of programmes and general administration the Corporation will be in the
same position of independence in regard to television for the home as V&quot;is in respect of sound broadcasting.   The Government will seek advice on technical questions generally and on the development of the B.B.C. television service from an Advisory Committee.television for public showing29. The Government agree with their predecessors that at this stage itis not possible to reach any final or detailed conclusions about television for public showing. Since the Broadcasting Committee reported, the cinemainterests have indicated that, although they no longer feel that a plan on aco-operative basis is practicable, they hope to comply with the Committee&apos;main recommendation that any scheme for publicly shown television shouldbe fair to the competing interests concerned. They are, however, opposedto the recommendation that programmes for public showing should be avail-able to the B.B.C., as of right, on terms approved by the Postmaster General.The Government consider that, subject to adequate safeguards for the interests affected, the development in its proper sphere of television for public showing to paying audiences should not be impeded by a refusal to grant the necessarywireless licences.30.   The sort of safeguards which the Government have in mind are:  (a) neither the television service for viewers in the home nor those for public showing should have access, as of right, to one another&apos;s pro-grammes and films. It is nevertheless desirable, especially in regardto those public spectacles and sporting events which are of over-whelming public interest, that the arrangements should offer reasonablesafeguards, so that neither the viewers in the home nor those in places of entertainment would be deprived of programmes of suchevents by reason of any exclusive arrangements, and any licence granted by the Postmaster General must take this into account. When thecinemas are licensed to use television they should also be prepared,subject to proper safeguards for their interests, to make films more readily available to the B.B.C.;(b) the arrangements must be fair to all the interests concerned and avoid the introduction into the home (except by arrangement with the service for viewers at home) of television programmes intended for showing to audiences in public places;id) any one branch of the entertainment industry would not be given an exclusive licence to use television for public showing;id) if the transmissions were to be by radio, the frequencies would haveto be allocated with regard to the needs of television for the home andof the other radio services.31. The cinema industry will no doubt wish to re-examine the positionand the Government feel that the industry should address themselves, topreparing a detailed scheme for consideration by the Governments AdvisoryCommittee. It must be recognised that the rate of development of televisionfor public showing, like that for viewers in the home, must inevitably take account of the national economic position and the prior calls upon resources.very high frequency sound broadcasting32. The rate of development of very high frequency sound broadcastingmust necessarily be subject to economic circumstances and the control ofcapital investment. An Advisory Committee, covering also television, willbe asked to consider the best methods of introducing higher frequency sound
broadcasting into the system of this country, including the form of modulationto be adopted, on which consultation with the radio industry will be essential.broadcast relay exchanges33. The Broadcasting Committee recommended that the relay exchanges(which pick up programmes from broadcasting stations for distribution bywires to subscribers) should be left to private enterprise and that licencesshould be granted for a term of ten years in the first instance, with powerto the Government to take over compulsorily then, or by two years&apos; notice,on &quot; going concern &quot; terms. The present and preceding licences, dating backto 1930, have provided that the Postmaster General might, on determination of the licence, acquire compulsorily such portions of the plant and apparatusas he might specify for a consideration &quot; equal to the value thereof at thedate of purchase as plant and apparatus in situ exclusive of any allowance or compensation for loss of profit compulsory sale goodwill the cost of raisingcapital or other consideration.&quot; The Government intend to grant a fifteen-year licence with power to the Postmaster General to take over compulsorilythen, or thereafter by two years&apos; notice. The existing terms of compensation would be modified to provide that, if the Postmaster General should eventuallytake over a particular exchange or exchanges, he would be under obligationto acquire all that plant and apparatus and not part only. Like their pre-predecessors, the Government accept the Broadcasting Committee&apos;s views that theclause in the present relay licences that only British subjects may be directors of the licensee companies should be discontinued and that in other respects the existing requirements of the licences should generally be maintained.The Committee also recommended that the B.B.C. might operate broadcastrelay exchanges in areas where direct radio reception of sound programmes is poor; this recommendation will need to be studied in the light of the developments of higher frequency broadcasting.educational broadcasting34. The Government agree with the views expressed on this subject inthe White Paper of July 1951 (Cmd. 8291, paragraphs 39 and 40).political broadcasting35. The Government propose to discuss the Broadcasting Committee&apos;s-recommendations about political broadcasting with the Opposition and theB.B.C.III.-RECOMMENDATIONS   AND   SUGGESTIONS   FOR   action by THE B.B.C.public representation service36. As indicated in paragraph 13 above, the new Charter will make ita duty of the Corporation to take such steps as may appear to them necessaryto bring their work under constant and effective review and to keep them intouch with outside opinion. The Government propose to leave it to the governors to decide how this should be done.staff conditions of employment37. In fixing the salaries and conditions of the staff the B.B.C. shouldtake account of the Government^ general policy on wages and kindredmatters.
38. The Government note that the Corporation have reconsidered theStaff Regulation dealing with the personal activities of the staff and that a revised version has been put to the Staff Association who are considering it.The Governors have also reviewed the Regulations about appeals from thestaff to the Board. The Government agree with the Corporation that theprocedure must depend on the eventual nature of the staff representationand the machinery established for that purpose. For the time being, there-fore, the range of appeals wili remain unrestricted and the existing arrange-ments unaltered.39. The Broadcasting Committee recommended that there should at all times be machinery in the Corporation for examining, independently and rapidly, charges of favouritism (or unjustifiable exclusion) brought to their notice by persons outside the B.B.C. - The Government understand that the governors have reviewed the existing arrangements in the light of thisrecommendation and that they are satisfied that no additional machinery is called for.joint consultative machinery40. The Broadcasting Committee recommended that the governors should consider methods of bringing into force joint consultative machineryfor improving the efficiency of the service. The Government are assured thatthe Corporation are in favour of having the most comprehensive system of consultation and information that may be possible and that the existing system provides for consultation both centrally and locally at various levelsthroughout the Corporation. The Government understand that further developments will be pursued in the light of the Broadcasting Committee&apos;recommendation and that in the B.B.C.&apos;s view it will be necessary to adaptthe methods used to the form taken by the system of staff representation asit develops.employment of aliens41. The Government, like their predecessors, consider it to be essentialthat the employment of aliens by the B.B.C. should continue to be subjectto such conditions as from time to time may be prescribed by the PostmasterGeneral. Subject to that, however, the Government agree that the governors should be free to decide whether aliens should be eligible for establishmentwithin the Corporation, provided they are free from restriction under the aliens Order, 1920, as to time of stay in Great Britain or in respect of theemployment they may take.printed and published by her majesty&apos;s stationery officeTo be purchased from york House, Kingsway, London, w.c.2     423 Oxford Street, London, w.1P.O. box 569, london, s.e.113a Castle Street, Edinburgh, 2      1 St. Andrew&apos;s Crescent, cardit39 King Street, Manchester, 2     Tower Lane, Bristol, 12 Edmund Street, Birmingham, 3      80 Chichester Street, belfast or from any Bookseller1952Price      net printed IN  GREAT BRITAIN42092 wt.       4/52   k  F.O.P.
