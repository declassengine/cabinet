THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTSECEET. - JORELATIONS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT and international BODIES.Machinery for Co-ordination among United Kingdom Departments.THE Minister of State is preparing, at the Cabinefs request (CM. 49 (45) and 51 (45) 5), a report on the means of preventing overlapping between thevarious international bodies established, or likely to be established, under theUnited Nations Organisation or otherwise.In addition, there is the domestic problem of securing effective co-co-ordination between the various Departments of His Majesty&apos;s Government in their relationswith these bodies.2. The Foreign Office is intimately concerned with the business transactedby all these international bodies and must have an effective voice in the formula-tion of Government policy towards them. Many of them deal, however, withtechnical questions which are of primary concern to Departments other than theForeign Office; and it will in practice be convenient, as it has been in the past,for these Departments to assume the primary responsibility for handling day-to-day questions arising out of their work. Thus, the Ministry of Labour willcontinue to be primarily responsible for relations with the International LabourOrganisation, the Ministry of Food for relations with the Food and agriculture organisation, and the Treasury for relations with the International monetary fund and the International Bank. The Appendix shows the Departments whichwill assume primary responsibility for the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwith all the existing, and some of the projected, international bodies.3. Though primary responsibility is assigned to particular Departments, asshown in the Appendix, it will be necessary for these Departments to maintain close-contact with other Departments interested in the questions coming before these bodies. For this purpose it may be convenient for the Departments with the primary responsibility to establish an interdepartmental advisory committee of officials representing the other Departments most directly concerned. TheMinistry of Labour, the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Transport havealready established advisory committees for the discussion of questions which areto be brought forward, respectively, at the International Labour Organisation,,the Food and Agriculture Organisation, and the United Maritime consultative council and European Central Internal Transport Organisation.4. While the primary responsibility for regulating the day-to-day relationswith these technical bodies may properly be left with the Departments most directly concerned with the subject matter assisted, as may be found necessary,,by interdepartmental advisory committees on the lines described in the preceding paragraph further machinery is required for the following purposes : *(a) To keep the Foreign Office effectively in touch with the work of. all theseinternational bodies.(b) To co-ordinate the policy followed by different Departments in theirdealings with them.5.   To meet these requirements it has been decided to establish (a) An Official Steering Committee, under Foreign Office chairmanship; and(&amp;) A small Secretariat, which will be staffed jointly by the Foreign Officeand the Cabinet Office and will work from the Cabinet Office.6. The Steering Committee will consist of senior official representatives of departments primarily responsible for relations with international bodies andsuch other Departmental representatives as it may be found expedient to addfrom time to time. Though the nominal membership of the Committee may be large, it will probably be found that in practice only a nucleus need attend all the meetings. It may also prove convenient to establish separate Panels to deal withspecial subjects, such as security and trusteeship. The general function of the steering Committee will be to secure co-ordination by bringing together the^Departments primarily responsible for relations with the various international bodies; and to resolve, subject to Ministers, such inconsistencies as may arise inthe objectives sought by different Departments in their dealings with differentinternational bodies. The Steering Committee will also have a special responsi-bility for the relations of His Majesty&apos;s Government with the Social and Economic[31643]
Council, the Trusteeship Council and the Security Council. It will take overthe work of the existing informal Advisory Committee on United Nations Affairs(the A.C.U. Committee).7. The Joint Secretariat will have no executive functions. Its main taskswill be to keep in touch with the proceedings of the international bodies them-selves and of the various interdepartmental advisory committees mentioned inparagraph 3 above; to see that the documents of both the international organisa-tions and the committees are given a proper circulation among United kingdon departments it is important to ensure, not only that Departments and individualofficials receive the papers they need, but also that they are not troubled withpapers they do not need; and to provide secretarial services for the steering committee. It may be found convenient that this Joint Secretariat should actas the distributing agency for communications from United Kingdom Delegationsat international conferences. Its secretarial services can also, if desired, be placed at the disposal of interdepartmental advisory committees dealing with inter-national business.8. When either the Steering Committee or a particular Department findsit necessary to obtain a Government decision on the policy to be followed inforthcoming discussions at any of these international&apos; bodies, the question a tissue will, wherever possible, be submitted to one of the existing committees of the Cabinet which are concerned with the subject matter, e.g., the lord presidents Committee or the Overseas Reconstruction Committee.&quot; The JointSecretariat will be in a position to advise how use can best be made of the existingCabinet Committee system for the purpose of obtaining any necessary decisions on international business. This will serve, not only to save the time of busyMinisters, but also to secure that the attitude taken by United KingdomDelegations at international discussions is fully in accord with our domestic9. It will be for later consideration, in the light of experience, whether there is need to constitute a special Ministerial Committee to deal with such;residual questions as cannot appropriately be handled by existing Committeesand need not be referred to the Cabinet itself.; -   April, 1946. &quot;Appendix.United Nations Organisations.Security Council.Trusteeship Council.Economic and Social Council.Military Staff Committee.Specialised A gencies International Labour Organisation.Food and Agriculture Organisation.International Monetary Fund.International Bank for reconstruction and Development.United Nations Educational, scientific and Cultural Organisation.International Trade Organisation.International Health Organisation.Provisional International Civil aviation-tion Organisation.Temporary Bodies 1U.N.R.RA.United Maritime Consultative Council.Temporary Regional Bodies 1Emergency Economic Committee for europe.European Coal Organisation.European Central Inland transport organisation.Departments primarily responsible.Foreign Office.Foreign Office.Foreign Office.Chiefs of Staff.Ministry of Labour.Ministry of Food.Treasury.Treasury.Ministry of Education.Board of Trade.Ministry of Health.Ministry of Civil Aviation.Foreign Office.Ministry of Transport.Foreign Office.Ministry of Fuel and Power.Ministry of Transport.
