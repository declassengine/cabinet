THIS DOCUMENT IB THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;s GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   May 1946.SECRET. Copy No.   3CP. (46) 199.22nd May, 1946.CABINET.QUESTIONS OF PROCEDURE FOR MINISTERS.Note by the Prime Minister.MY colleagues may find it convenient to have the annexed consolidated andrevised statement of the directives which I have issued from time to time onprocedural and other similar matters.2. I should be glad if they would bring to the notice of their Ministerialand Official subordinates the sections which concern them. For this purposeadditional copies may be obtained from the Cabinet Office.3. This statement supersedes those contained in OP. (45) 99, 100, 204, 249,282, 306 and 310.(Initialled) C. R. A.10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,22nd May, 1946.I. Cabinet Procedure.Preparation of Business for the Cabinet.1.   The business of the Cabinet consists, in the main, of (i) questions on which there is a conflict of interest between Departments,which has not been resolved;(ii) questions of major policy which affect a number of Departments orengage the collective responsibility of the Government.Except in cases of extreme urgency, questions falling under the first of theseheads should not be referred to the Cabinet until all possible means of resolvingthe conflict have been exhausted, including personal correspondence or discussion between the Ministers concerned. Similarly, it must be the normal rule that matters falling under the second head should be thoroughly examined at the
official level, if necessarily interdepartmentally, before they are referred to ministers, so that the policy decisions required may be clearly defined. this applies particularly to proposals which involve expenditure, or affect general financial or economic policy : these should always be discussed with the Treasury and, if Treasury agreement has not been secured at the official level, with theChancellor of the Exchequer before they are submitted to the Cabinet or to a ministerial Committee. This rule does not, of course, limit the right of ministers to submit to the Cabinet memoranda setting out their views on general issues of policy.2. Matters which fall wholly within the departmental responsibility of asingle Minister and do not engage the collective responsibility of the government need not be brought to Cabinet at all. A precise definition of such matters cannotbe given and in borderline cases a Minister is well-advised to bring the matter before his colleagues.3. When a Minister wishes to raise a matter orally at the Cabinet, his private Secretary should give the earliest possible notice to the Secretary, whowill seek the Prime Ministers consent.Cabinet Memoranda.4. A Memorandum intended for consideration by the Cabinet, other thanone commenting on a Memorandum already circulated, must be circulated twoclear days before the meeting at which it is to be considered. A precise formula-tion of this rule has been issued to all Departments by the Secretary of theCabinet, who is responsible for seeing that it is strictly enforced. Exceptionscan be allowed only in cases of extreme urgency, with the sanction of the PrimeMinister.5. Memoranda for the Cabinet should be as brief and as clear as possible.The model memorandum, explains at the outset what the problem is, indicatesbriefly the relevant considerations, and concludes with a precise statement of thedecision sought. To facilitate reference in discussion, paragraphs should benumbered. Supporting data may often be relegated to an Appendix. If authority is sought to make a statement or despatch a telegram a draft may be attached.Time spent in making a memorandum short and clear will be saved many timesover in reading and in discussion.6. Cabinet memoranda are normally reproduced by the Cabinet Office, thedraft being sent to the Cabinet Office for the purpose by the originating Depart-ment. If for any reason a Cabinet memorandum is reproduced by the originatingDepartment, all copies thus reproduced must be sent to the Cabinet Office, applica-tion being made to the Cabinet Office for any additional copies required by thereproducing Department. If a Department so wishes, a standing arrangementmay be made wdiereby the Cabinet Office will automatically supply a fixed numberof additional copies of memoranda originating in the Department.
7. Subject to such special instructions in regard to any particular paper as he may receive from the Prime Minister or from the responsible Minister,the Secretary circulates memoranda and other documents prepared for their use to all Cabinet Ministers and, in&quot; addition, either to all Ministers &quot; of Cabinetrank &quot; or to those Ministers whose Departments are affected.8. In no circumstances, other than those provided for in paragraph 6 above,are Cabinet memoranda to be reproduced or copied in Departments. &quot;Where a department requires an additional copy or copies of a memorandum, applicationmust in every case be made to the Cabinet Office.A Itendance at Cabinet.9. It is of assistance to the Secretary if Private Secretaries indicate, whenasking for a subject to be placed on the Agenda, which Ministers, other thanmembers of the Cabinet, are likely to be affected, so that arrangements may, ifnecessary, be made for their attendance.10. Ministers summoned to meetings of the Cabinet for particular itemswill receive an Agenda Paper on which an approximate time will be set againsteach item. Every endeavour is made not to keep Ministers waiting, but thetime at which each item will be reached cannot be forecast exactly. Cabinetmeetings take precedence over other business. The utmost endeavours should bemade by Ministers to be punctual and thus avoid wasting the time of their colleagues.11. The Prime Ministers Private Secretary on duty at the Cabinet roomis responsible for ensuring that the proceedings of the Cabinet are not disturbed.To assist him, Ministers should give general instructions that messages are notto be sent to them while in Cabinet, unless they are so urgent that they cannotwait until the end of the meeting.12. If a member of the Cabinet, or a Minister summoned for a particularitem, is unable, for any reason, to be present at a meeting of the Cabinet, heshould notify the Secretary, who will inform the Prime Minister and will also consider whether any re-arrangement of business is required.13. The Secretary should also be informed of Ministers&apos; out-of-town engage-ments, and also of their week-end and holiday arrangements, in order that, if somesudden emergency arises, he may be in a position to inform the Prime Ministerat once which Ministers are immediately available.Cabinet Conclusions.14. It is an instruction to the Secretary, in drafting Cabinet Conclusions,I to avoid, so far as practicable, reference to opinions expressed by particularMinisters. The record in respect of each item will be limited to the decision ofthe Cabinet, together with such summary of the discussion as may be necessaryfor the guidance to those called upon to take action on the decision. Matters of exceptional secrecy are recorded in a &quot; Confidential Annex.&quot;
15. Copies of the Conclusions are circulated by the Secretary to cabinet ministers and Ministers of Cabinet rank. Copies of &quot; Confidential Annexes&quot;are sent only to the Ministers directly concerned.16. Any suggested amendments to Cabinet Conclusions must reach theSecretary not later than the next day but one following that on which the Meeting-was held.   Thereafter the Conclusions will be sent to be printed in final form.17. All Ministers are responsible for giving such instructions to their departments as may be necessary to give effect to the Conclusions of the Cabinet,and for communicating to subordinate Departments or branches decisions ofwhich they should be made aware. The Lord Chancellor is responsible for communicating to the English Law Officers such decisions as concern them.Where an urgent matter arises in Cabinet unexpectedly, and a decision is reachedrequiring immediate action by a Department not represented at the Meeting, theSecretary will ensure that the Department concerned is notified forthwith.18. Where a Department has to take action upon, or is otherwise directly affected by, a particular Conclusion, the actual decisions of the Cabinet on that matter may be copied in the Department, together with so much of the record ofthe discussion as is essential to a proper understanding of them, and these extractsmay be passed to responsible officers in the Department, as may be necessary.The distribution within a Department of such extracts from Cabinet conclusions should be limited to the occasions on which it is strictly necessary for the efficientdischarge of public business, and care should be taken to see that extracts are sentonly to those officers of the Department who need be acquainted with the actualterms of the decision. Duplicate copies of the complete Conclusions are notissued for this purpose by the Cabinet Office save in exceptional cases. Whereaction has to be taken at once by a Department without waiting for the circula-tion of the full Conclusions, application may be made to the Secretary for an advance copy of the relevant Conclusion.19. In this connection the position of the Parliamentary Secretary shouldnot be overlooked. He may Vave to deputise for his Minister, at Cabinet or inthe House, at short notice. Apart from any special responsibility assigned tohim in a limited field, he should be encouraged to share in the responsibility forthe formulation of policy and consequently should be kept in general touch withall Cabinet matters affecting his own Department.Return of Cabinet Documents.20. Cabinet documents are, throughout their existence, the property of theCrown; the normal practice is, therefore, that Ministers, on relinquishing office,return to the Cabinet Office all Cabinet documents, with the exception of anyimmediately required for current administration, which may be handed on totheir successors. In order to facilitate this arrangement, Ministers are asked toarrange for the return to the Cabinet Office during their tenure of office, say at intervals of three or six months, such Cabinet documents as are not required for current administration.
The provision above for handing on certain Cabinet documents to a Ministerssuccessor does not always apply on a change of Government : special instructionswill be issued to cover such cases.II. Committees of the Cabinet.Committee Procedure.21. The procedure outlined above applies mutatis mutandis to ministerial committees of the Cabinet. In addition, the Prime Minister wishes the chairmen of Committees to keep the following points in mind : (a) Discussion should be kept to the point; irrelevance or repetition shouldbe checked.(b) Conclusions should not be framed in a way which will require further discussion by Ministers, if that is not necessary. Sometimes, when apolicy decision has been taken, there is a tendency for a Committee to regard itself as responsible for its detailed working out or the super-vision of its execution. While that may sometimes be appropriate, itcan usually be left to the Ministers departmentally concerned.(c) The dilatory process of referring a question from one Committee toanother should be avoided as far as possible.Secrecy of Cabinet Committees.22. It is contrary to accepted practice for Government decisions to be announced in terms which disclose or imply that they have been reached by aparticular Committee of the Cabinet. While the collective responsibility ofMinisters often calls for discussion between Ministers on some important questionwhich falls wholly or mainly within the purview of a single Department, thenormal course is for the resulting decision to be announced and defended by theMinister concerned as his own decision.23. There may be rare occasions when it is desirable to emphasise theimportance of some decision by stating specifically that it is the decision of HisMajesty&apos;s Government or the Cabinet. This, however, should be the exceptionrather than the rule. The growth of any general practice whereby decisions of theCabinet or of Cabinet Committees were announced as such would lead to embarrassing-rassment. Thus, some decisions of Government would be regarded as lessauthoritative than others. Critics of the decision reached by a particularMinisterial Committee would press for its review by some other Committee or bythe Cabinet, while the constitutional right of individual Ministers to speak in thename of the Government as a whole would be impaired.24. The underlying principle is, of course, that the method adopted by ministers for discussion among themselves of questions of policy is essentially domestic matter, and is no concern of Parliament or the public. The doctrine of collective reponsibility of Ministers depends, in practice, upon the existence
of opportunities for free and frank discussion between them, and such discus-sion is hampered if the processes by which it is carried on are laid bare.25. For these reasons it is also the general peace-time practice to avoiddisclosure of particulars of the composition and terms of reference of cabinet committees, other than of one or two long-established Standing Committees.During the recent war, as happened in the first World War, some relaxation was found desirable as regards the lay-out of the War Cabinet Committee system, inorder that Parliament might be informed of the main structure of the organisationthrough which the Government handled the great volume of business connectedwith the prosecution of the war. But care was taken to maintain the general position that detailed particulars of Cabinet Committees generally were notdisclosed, and requests for such information have often been refused.III. Precautions against Unauthorised Disclosures of Information.26. Disclosures in the Press of matters under discussion by the cabinet or its Committees damage the reputation of the Government and impair theefficiency of its administration.The General Rule.27. During the war military secrets were disclosed only to those who hadto act upon them or had to know of them for the purpose of their official duties.This rule could not be applied without modification to political secrets in timeof peace. For Ministers who share the collective responsibility for the Govern-ment&apos;s programme must be generally aware of the development of important aspects of Government policy. But, outside this narrow circle, knowledge ofthese matters should be confined to those, whether Ministers or officials, whose duty it is to assist in the formulation of the particular policy concerned orneed to know what is afoot because of its effect on other aspects of public business for which they are responsible.Points to be kept in Mind.28. Ministers have a personal responsibility for ensuring that all membersof their staffs understand the need for exercising the strictest discretion, and inparticular for seeing that the appropriate precautions are strictly observed intheir Departments. In this connexion the following considerations should beborne in mind : (1) While it is within the discretion of Ministers to decide which of their advisers or subordinates should be shown Cabinet papers, the normal rule is that such papers should not be seen by any save their immediate advisers concerned in the formulation of policy.
(2) Ministers are expected to exercise a real measure of control in the matter,and must satisfy themselves from time to time that their instructions are being carried out.(3) A Minister who is a Member of the Cabinet has responsibilities wider than those of his own Department, and will in that capacity receive some documents which are of no concern to any of his subordinates.(4) A Parliamentary Private Secretary is not a member of the Government;and the information given to him should be correspondingly limited.(5) Documents containing or reflecting the personal views of Ministers arein a special category, and their handling requires special care, ifthe collective responsibility of the Cabinet as a whole is to be preserved.This applies particularly to the Minutes of the Cabinet and its mainStanding Committees, in the handling of which the procedure laiddown in paragraph 17 above should be followed.(6) If occasions arise on which it is necessary that any considerable numberof officers should be consulted in particular issues arising out ofCabinet memoranda, this should be done by means of minutesaddressed to the officers concerned, confined to the particular points on which they are required to advise, thus avoiding a wide circulation of the memoranda themselves.(7) Experience has shown that leakages of information have often occurredas a result of the skilful piecing together, by representatives of thePress, of isolated scraps of information, each in itself apparentlyof little importance, gathered from several sources. The only saferule is, therefore, never to mention such matters even in the formof guarded allusions, except to those who must be informed of themfor reasons of State, until the time has come when disclosure, in wholeor in part, is authorised. Reasons of State may require, in appro-priate cases, the confidential communication of some information toa responsible Editor, Lobby Correspondent, &amp;e. for purposes of guidance; but such communication is only justified where it can be ensured that the confidence and the terms on which it is made arerespected.Need for Discretion.29. Secrecy cannot, however, be secured solely by rules, however carefullydrawn, restricting the circulation of papers; public business cannot be transactedwithout a fairly wide dissemination of confidential information within Govern-ment circles; and the essential point is the observance of a high standard of discretion by all who acquire knowledge of such information in the course oftheir duties an attitude of mind which puts first the interests of the government as a whole and subordinates everything to that end. It is the duty of ministers to set this standard of discretion in regard to all confidential matters whichcome within their knowledge, to give an example to others, and to see thattheir example is followed.
Responsibility of the Lord Chancellor.30. The Prime Minister has asked the Lord Chancellor to assume a general responsibility for investigating unauthorised disclosures of information aboutthe proceedings of the Cabinet or Cabinet Committees. Ministers are askedto notify the Lord Chancellor of any such disclosure which comes to their notice and to assist him in any investigation involving their Department.IY. Ministerial Speeches and Broadcasts.Foreign Affairs.31. Ministers wishing to mention in public speeches any matter affectingour relations with Foreign Powers or Foreign Affairs, including post-warproblems, should on all occasions consult the Foreign Office beforehand.Defence Policy.32. If Ministers.wish to make reference to broad matters of defence policy they should in all cases first consult the Office of the Minister of Defence.Effect on Parliamentary Business.33. Unless they have first obtained the agreement of the Leader of theHouse of Commons, Ministers should avoid saying anything which might affectthe programme of Government business in Parliament. Thus, they should not,without his agreement, promise White Papers, the publication of which might result in a demand for a special Debate : and legislation should never be promisedwithout the express approval of the Cabinet or the Legislation Committee. Thisis a matter in which special care is necessary, since statements made by ministers are liable to be represented in the Press as foreshadowing early legislation.Broadcasting A rrangements.34. The Prime Minister has prescribed the General Post Office as theGovernment Department for dealing with broadcasts by persons of Ministerialrank, i.e., Cabinet Ministers, other Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries.In future all Ministers intending to broadcast should communicate with thePostmaster-General, who will be responsible for obtaining the Prime ministers approval in all cases and for making the necessary arrangements with the B.B.C.In view of the fact that broadcasts by Ministers may be regarded by the B.B.C.or by the Opposition as controversial and therefore giving a claim to a reply,the subject of the broadcast must in all cases be given and the Prime minister may require to see either an outline or the text of a broadcast before givingapproval.
Y. Press Articles and Interviews by Ministers.Press Articles.35. Ministers are precluded from journalism in any form; but thisprohibition does not extend to authorship of writings of a literary, historical,scientific, philosophical or romantic character. For these there are abundantprecedents.36. This rule need not be interpreted as debarring Ministers from writingarticles or letters to newspapers, in order to supplement the means already usedfor enlightening the public in regard to measures before Parliament and other administrative questions affecting the work of their Departments.37. Should a Minister deem it necessary to write such an article he shouldnot accept payment if it is offered. In deciding whether to write an article heshould bear in mind his obligations to Parliament. For example, he should be careful not to discuss a Bill before it has received its second reading in the Houseof Commons.38. These rules govern dealings with the foreign as well as the home Press.Interviews.39. The granting of special interviews to individual Press representativesis a matter for the discretion of the Minister concerned. As a general rule,however, the same considerations should apply as for written articles, i.e., ifgranted, an interview should be confined to elucidating the policy or work of theMinister and Department concerned. The same considerations regardingobligations to Parliament also apply, and Ministers should bear in mind that an interview granted to a representative of a single newspaper or agency may arousejealousy and thus hostility in the rest of the Press.Contributions to Party Publications.40. The general prohibition on the writing of articles for the Press neednot be regarded as debarring Ministers from contributing to the publications ofthe political organisations with which they are associated. Payment should notbe accepted for such articles.General.41. In general, Ministers should keep such activities to a minimum, andbear in mind that their relations with the Press are always liable to be the subjectof Questions in Parliament. Ministers should refer to the Prime Minister in anycase about which they are in doubt.
YI. Parliamentary Private Secretaries.42. Parliamentary Private Secretaries occupy a special position which isnot always understood by the general public, either at home or abroad. Theyare not members of the Government, and should be careful not to be spoken of as such. They are Private Members, and should therefore be afforded as great aliberty of action as possible; but their close and confidential association with ministers necessarily imposes certain obligations on them, and has led to thefollowing generally accepted practice :  Parliamentary Private Secretaries should not make statements in theHouse or put Questions on matters affecting the Department with which theyare connected. They should also exercise great discretion in any speechesor broadcasts which they make outside the House, taking care not to makestatements which appear to be made in an official or semi-official capacity,and bearing in mind at the same time that, however careful they may be tomake it clear that they are speaking only as Private Members, they arenevertheless liable to be regarded as speaking with some of the authority which attaches to a member of the Government.YII. Absence of Ministers from the United Kingdom.43. It is the established practice for a Minister of Cabinet rank to obtainThe King&apos;s permission to be absent from the United Kingdom, whether on duty or on leave, and to inform His Majesty of the arrangements which he proposesto make for the administration of his office during that time.44. Any such arrangements must have the Prime Ministers prior approval and are subject to the following general limitations : In the absence of a Secretary of State, submissions to His Majestymust be made on his behalf by another Secretary of State. Submissions onbehalf of the First Lord of the Admiralty may be made in his absence bythe Senior Lord Commissioner. In the absence of other Cabinet Ministers,submissions may be made by the Parliamentary Secretary of the department concerned, if he is a Privy Councillor; if not, by another Cabinet Minister.45. Parliamentary Secretaries who wish to be absent from the UnitedKingdom should obtain the consent of the Prime Minister as well as of theirown Minister.
