Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1946.SECRET.Copy No.   3 8CP. (46) 197.17th May, 1946.CABINET.CONVERSATION WITH M. BIDAULT.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate for the information of my colleagues a noie of a conversation which I had in Paris on the 15th May with the French Foreign Minister,Foreign-Office, 17th May, 1946.The Secretary of State met M. Bidault at dinner last night at the CanadianEmbassy. M. Bidault seemed to be in a bad mood when we sat down to dinner.This may partly have been due to exhaustion and hunger, as the Council had met for five hours and we did not dine till 10 p.m., and partly to irritation atthe cavalier way in which Mr. Byrnes had suggested that the question of germany should be disposed of in one further meeting of the Council. But as the dinnerwent on M. Bidault mellowed and had an hour&apos;s&quot;very cordial conversationwith the-Secretary of State.The Secretary of State spoke of his love for France and of his sympathy with France&apos;s difficulties in 1940. France had suffered terribly in the 1914-18war and had never been given time to recover. He had always been a friend of France and had done all he could for General de Gaulle. M. Bidault warmlyaccepted this. France in 1940 had lacked time, space and men. She had neverhad time to recover from the blitz German bombing, she had not been able toregroup her forces, and had been betrayed by the Fleet. The political leaders were not up to the job.The Secretary of State next reminded M- Bidault that if our two Empireswere co-ordinated we had together the greatest mass of man-power in the world.M. Bidault said that he wished he could revive the proposal for commoncitizenship made by Mr. Churchill to M. Reynaud in 1940, but he feared thatit was too late.to carry the proposal, or, at least, too soon to revive it.The Secretary of State gave M. Bidault a hint about our ideas for thedevelopment of Africa. M. Bidault was much intrigued and recalled a remarkwhich de Gaulle (&quot;an impossible man but a great heart &quot;) had made to him in1940 : &quot; We shall win because we have the Sahara.&quot;After toasts to the eternal friendship of France and Great Britain andto the two Empires, M. Bidault took me aside and said that he had been deeplytouched by what the Secretary of State had said to-night, and also by his wholeattitude towards France in the recent past. Nobody could mistake the Secretaryof State&apos;s love for France and the sincerity of his intentions. We could, haveanything we wished of France. . If we wanted an alliance to-morrow, we could have it, but he thought our view was that it was better to wait to settle thesematters until after the elections.   That was also his view.16*% May, 1946. .M. Bidault.E. B.13329   [31845]
