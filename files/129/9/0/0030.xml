q ___;) agaMATCD3.g:.^J!rkAw5.:.^.^ -(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E . TCP. (1+6)  18030th April. 1946.CABINETNEWSPRINTJoint Memorandum by the Lord. President of the Counciland the Chancellor of the exchequer at its 13th Meeting on the&apos; 12th&apos; April, the lord president&apos;s Committee agreed that the Newspaper Propraetorsmight be informed that if the American Loan were obtainedthey would be allowed to import enough additional newsprintto allow the 4-poge 1d.  paper to be increased to 6 pages.They were to be authorised to convey this to the canadian and Newfoundland suppliers of the newsprint if it could bedone without danger of leakage.2.       We saw the Newspaper Proprietors accordingly.      Theyexplained that if definite contracts were placed theinformation was likely to leak out, and it was accordinglyarranged that they should endeavour to get the centralrepresentative of the manufacturers to earmark the necessaryquantity of paper for the time being on the understanding thatthe contracts would be placed if and when the loan was through.-3.        The negotiations between the Newspaper Proprietors andMr. Doane, representing the manufacturers, have disclosed  .that he can only offer to keep open until the end of June apart of the quantity of paper required, and if the whole is tobe assured immediate contracts must be made.      The pressure of demand from America and elsewhere  on long term contractsis such that the Newspaper Proprietors are advised that thereis grave doubt whether they would be able to obtain any paper&quot;&apos;for 19U7 additional to that contracted for now that theCanadian manufacturers are making up their order books.Moreover,  there -will be serious danger that they would not beable to obtain supplies in later years unless a long term contract is placed, immediately.COPY NO.2S?4.        If the Canadian and Newfoundland supplies are limitedto the 135,000 tons for 1947 which Mr. Doane has offered tokeep open until June, even on the basis of a 6-page paper thetotal newsprint stock in this country would be reduced by theend of 1947 to less than 30,000 tons unless increased supplies were obtainable in this country or in Scandinavia.     Thiswould be a dangerously low stock, even for a 6-page paper, andwould render it impossible to increase to 8 pages.

5.        It is of cour.se to be hoped that newsprint productionin this country may be increased next year, but this is dependent upon supplies of pulp from Scandinavia and Finland,in addition to the pulpwood we hope to get from Newfoundland,which in their turn are dependent upon coal supplies to thosecountries and upon what.Russia takes from Finland in the wayof wood or pulp.      In those circumstances no assurance&quot; of aa-0early increase in the home production can be given or &quot;of    ZwOobtaining any newsprint from Scandinavia or Finland.6.       The Newspaper proprietors have accordingly approached.&apos; - us again and asked that they may be permitted at once toplace long-term contracts with the Canadian and Newfoundlandmanufacturers sufficient to increase their size to the-page basis immediately after the Loan was through and toan 8-page some time in 19h7, and to make reasonable provisionfor future years.      They do not ask for any&apos; presentauthority from the Government to increase their size beyondthe indication already given them that they would be allowedto go up to. 6 pages if the American Loan were obtained.\ They say that there would be no difficulty whatever inI disposing of the newsprint or cancelling the contracts ifv the Government should later find this necessary.      While they&apos; would do their best to secure secrecy,  it is likely-thatthe fact of placing the contracts would become public inCanada, although it would be made clear that this was merelyan insurance and did&quot;not imply a decision by the Governmentthat the size of United Kingdom newspapers should be increased.7.       The Newspaper Proprietors after careful considerationof the figures ask to be permitted at once to place contracts with the Canadian and Newfoundland manufacturers for a periodif necessary of five years to the following amounts.      the dollar cost f.o.b.  at present prices is indicated;    priceshowever would not be firm in the contracts but would vary according to U.S.   prices and would be likely to rise in 19h-8.19U7 200,000 tons  3,200,00019h8 250,000 tons  h,000,00019h9 andsucceeding years 300,000 tons  h,800,000Pre-war imports from Canada and Newfoundland were somewhatunder 1+00,000 tons a year,8.        These quantities would render an 8-page paper possiblesome time in 19h,7 if there is a reasonable increase in homeoutput;    and some time in 1 9h-9 in the absence of any increase,which is an unduly pessimistic assumption.      They would permit a twelve-page paper in 19h9 or 1950 provided home output had risen by that time to three-quarters of pre-war,  and a largerpaper if and when home output approaches pre-war.9.       We feel that these quantities make a reasonable and not1     excessive provision against increases in the sizes of\    newspapers,  and reasonably safeguard the interests of the U. K.I    mills.      We recommend that the Newspaper Proprietors be\    permitted to place these contracts on the understanding that\    it is made clear that they are an insurance against theJ   possibility of increase in size and do not commit the Governmentto allow increases,10.      In our opinion the contracts should include an option toreduce the amounts involved, if the public-interest so. require,and we propose to ask the&apos;Newspaper Proprietors to agree to this in writing.H.-M.Great George Street, S.W.-1. H..D.30th April, 191+6.
