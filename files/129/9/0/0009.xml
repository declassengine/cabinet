3 E C R E copy NO.O.P.(U6) 15916TH APRIL,  19U6CABINETWORLD WHEAT SUPPLIES AND THEIR REPERCUSSIONSUPON THE UNITED KINGDOM POSITIONMcmorandmn by the Minister of Pood(Note;    The figures used in this paper are in terms of wheat equivalent where appropriate)1.     As I indicated at the meeting of the World Pood SuppliesCommittee on the 9th April, the whole position in regard to worldwheat supplies generally, and to the United Kingdom in particular,has undergone a marked deterioration recently and it will benecessary for my colleagues to agree to decisive and immediateremedial fiction if the situation in this country is to he kept under control.2.      The field to be covered is so wide as to make it impossible in a paper of this kind, to explain it in great detail.      For the convenience of my colleagues,  therefore, I propose in the firstplace to summarise the latest world position, secondly, itsdirect and indirect effects upon the United Kingdom, and thirdly,to suggest the remedies which, in my judgment, must be adopted.Position up to 30th June, 19U.6a.      The world statistical position for the six months ending on the 30th June 19/4.6 is given in Appendix I.      The figures of requirements are those adopted recently in Washington and representvery severe reductions upon the quantities originally stated bythe claimant countries to be their minimum requirements.      Itwill be recalled for example that India needed 2,020,000 tons ofwheat for the first half of 19L.6, and 500,000 tons of rice forthe second quarter of 19L6; on the paper allocations she has beengiven only 1,LOO,000 tons of wheat and coarse grain, and about150,000 tons of rice.      South Africa needed 223,000 tons of wheat;her paper allocation is only 175,000 tons.      Malaya, Singapore,Hong Kong and Borneo needed 156,000 tons of wheat and 212,000 tonsof rice, making a total of 358,000 tons;  the paper allocationsare only 135,000 tons of wheat and about 100,000 tons of rice, atotal of 235,000 tons.k-      In practice,  claimant countries will receive considerably less physical wheat than they are&apos; due to receive on paper becausethe latest allocations wore based upon an inflated figure ofsupplies.      The U.S.A.  agreed to make available for export during&quot;the six months ending the 30th June, 19L6 at least 5,500,000 tonsof wheat and Mr.. Clinton Anderson was confident that the figurecould be raised to 6,000,000 tons.&apos;     U.S.A. shipments during thefirst three months amounted in total to 2,827,000 tons (of which not inconsiderable quantities are believed to have been sent for commercial reasons to countries whose requirements were expecteds DOCUMENT IS TIE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; 3 GOVERNMENT)

xo be programmed against other sources of supply), while thelatest official estimate of April shipments is only about 600,000tons.      Over the first four months there will have been a shortfall  in shipments against programmed intentions of the orderof 600,000 tons which will impose upon the U.S.A.  the necessityof shipping not less than 2,600,000 tons during May and June 192+if she is to live up to attain her higher target.      It is doubtfulwhether this quantity,  even if it were available,  couldphysically be transported and shipped over so short a time,but in any a vent,  I do not believe that 2,600,000 tons ofwheat can in fact be made  available for export during theperiod unless very much more drastic steps are taken in theU. 8.A.      While it is perhaps too early to form a deliberatejudgment, it is difficult to be convinced that the measuresso far taken in the II. 3.A. will be productive of any very marked result.      Control as we understand the word isalmost completely lacking and the physical difficulties ofsecuring rigid enforcement of such legislation on thesubject as has been passed are, I believej insuperable atleast in the  short term.      The blunt truth of the matter isthat American farmers are not selling all their wheat andthat substantial quantities are held by speculators.      Ithas always been the custom of the North American farmer -as it is in other countries - to keep some wheat back until he has assessed the effect of winter weather and rain upon his next crop and normally an increase in cominercialisationwould occur about the beginning of May.      But other factors,I ara afraid, will operate this year.      The farmer is being-told by all tho resources of modern publicity that wheatis in d spur.--.toly short, supply and his natural instinct isto hold on to his own stocks, partly as an insurance against further contingencies,.and partly because he thinks that the ceiling price will sooner or later have to be raised to attract wheat sales,5.     Allowance must therefore be made for a Serious short-fall in the promised supplies from the U.3.A.  and it is this fact which has made it impossible for the Exporters&apos;Co-unit toe to designate soiirces of supply for the fullquantities    of wheat and coarse grain allocated on paperduring the recent Washington discussions.      In consequence,the Americans are searching feverishly, under considerable political pressure,  to find some means, at the expense of others, of making good their shortfall, and this is the explanation for the violent attack: upon the United Kingdomposition,6.     Arising out of the recent offer made by H. M.   Governmentto ration bread if the U. 8.  Government would do likewise, wehave been asked to suggest the measures which might be takenby the U.3.  and Canadian Government as an equitablealternative to bread rationing.      I   propose, with theconcurrence of my colleagues, to suggest the following as theminimum requirements.      I believe that all of these could beput into effect almost immediately, and that they would notcall for the creation of new administrative machinery of anysubstantial magnitude.      The response of the U.S.  Governmentto those suggestions will afford a practical tost of themeasure of their anxiety to redress a world position, largelythe result of their own shortcomings.(i) the immediate closure of the future   marketsin the States, and the taking over by theGovernment of all open contracts.

(ii) immediate; requisition of all stocks of grainin the hands of millers, merchants, elevatoroperators, provender millers and other -holders.(iii) no.farmer to retain any millable wheat on hisfarm with the exception of 5;,i tailing allowance and seed requirements.(iv) requisition of flour stocks in the handsof millers in excess of three weeks&apos;  currentrequirements.(v) cropping directions for 191+6/U7 to give notless than 80 million acres.(vi) full disclosure to the Combined Pood Board of allstock and other statistics in respect of wheat,maize and other coarse grains comparable in all respects with those disclosed to the combined food Board by the United Kingdom,.7.      I see no prospect of the realisation by the 30th Junenext of the paper allocation for export of 750,000 tons ofwheat from the Argentine,  and it must be borne in mind  that asubstantial part of the 1,1+00,000 tons of coarse grains whichwere assumed to be available  (mainly from Argentina) for allocation against wheat requirements have already been shippedand used for animal feeding in the receiving countries.There is&apos; still some hope that Canada and Australia will be ableto export daring the period the quantities allowed for in theWashington discussions, but realisation of these quantitieswill leave Canada in particular&apos; with almost negligible quantitiesfor export during the following throe months.      This has adirect effect upon the United Kingdom and is dealt with more fully later in this paper,8.      Summing up the world position for the six months ending the 30th June 191+6,  I should be disposed to estimate that inthe absence of further drastic measures, particularly in theU. 3.A., the total quantity which will actually be exported duringthe six months will not exceed 11,500,000 tons.      In theWashington discussions it was assumed that during the six monthsthere could be made available for export in the form of wheat and coarse grain a total of 13,000,000 tons, and the estimatedshortfall is therefore about 1,500,000 tons, plus 500,000 tons,the original shortfall on the allocation, making an estimated total shortfall of about 2,000,000 tone, against a totalallocation of 13,500,000 tons.      This deficiency can be coveredonly by a further cut in allocations - in practice by failing to supply the full quantity of physical wheat and coarse grainagainst the paper allocations with consequent hardship toclaimant countries.Position; July jrgjuS - Juno 191+79.     I attach as Appendix II a statistical appreciation ofthe world wheat position for the twelve months ending on the30th June 191+7.      This can be  little more than intelligentguess-work at the present date because there are many impoh-3e?able factors e,g.  on the export availability side, weathera&quot;U yields, the practical effect of conservation measures inthe four main exporting countries and the position of theU.8.S..R.  and the Balkans and, on the requirements side,  the

quantity which each claimant country will require.      But iam satisfied that, at this stage it would he most imprudent to-count upon any very material improvement in the position.      The.statistical deficit so far- as wheat is concerned is considerablysmaller than during the previous twelve months, hut the shortageof cereal feeding-stuffs will &quot;be so great as. to createconditions of artificial - if not actual - scarcity of wheat.It must also be borne in mind that stocks in the four exporting countries will be at a very low ebb because the drive has &quot;been to export maximum quantities during the first six months at theexpense of the subsequent period.      Even if statistically the 1946/1947 harvest Were to shqw no deficit there would still bo aphysical shortage during the first throe months (duly/September194b;  of the Now Year until the new North American crops move into export position.10.    It was with these considerations in mind that I urged the Combined Pood Board to take immediate steps to secure thenecessary forecasts of wheat supplies and requirements for theyear 1946/47 with the object of planning and settling thedistribution if only on a provisional basis before the 30thJuno to enable importing countries in their turn to cut theircoat according to their cloth.      If this be not done,  claimantcountries will again be tempted to allow too groat a quantityof their indigenous grain to be fed early in the season tolivestock, leading to a wild scramble later for imported supplies to make good the deficiency with the r^al risk that the inflateddemands will again make it impossible by any device to bringrequirements into proper relation with available supplies,      i fear&quot; that the Combined Pood Board is so preoccupied with theimmediate problem of the next two months that it is devotinginsufficient attention to what I &quot;believe to be the even moreimportant task of getting the wheat position right for 1946/47.The world cannot go on indefinitely   n the present hand tomouth basis but unless the nettle be grasped firmly and quickly,I fear that the wheat problem may not he solved for a long time.I regard it as imperative that the Combined Pood Board should begin immediately to plan for 1946/47, the objective being toissue a list of provisional allocations for all countries bythe 15th June and I propose with the concurrence of my colleagues to press this view vigorously with the Combined Pood Board.      Itis, in any event, becoming increasingly unreal to confineattention&quot;to the period up to the end of the chosen statisticalyear i.e.  the 30th June.      We cannot pass from an era of shortageto one of-plenty in a single night and the problem on the 1stJuly will be no different from that on the 30th June.      the americans for their own purposes are very anxious to representthe problem as essentially a short term one - the presidentrecently gave the duration as 90 days - but this of course isnot the case and we must spare no effort to force this issue.11.    While the United Kingdom position is of course affectedby the world position as Set out in the first part of this paper,  in that if there ware ample supplies of wheat availablethere would be no problem it is not directly affected by the shortfall in U.S.A.  supplies,  except insofar us this results inattempts   to raid our stocks to satisfy claimants upon Americansupplies.      The totel paper allocation of U,8.  supplies tothe whole London Pood Council Area,  including India, but excluding the British Zone of Germany, for the six months period is only about 250,000 tons, none of which is destined for theUnited Kingdom.      The very serious deterioration in the UnitedKingdom position results from the inability of the Canadiansto make available- to this country, until their new harvest moves,

the quantities which we need for arrival in July, August andSeptemher; and the virtual impossibility under present conditionsof making gooo the deficiency from other sources of supply.12.    On the basis of the latest estimates, Canada will beable to ship to this country up to the 30th June, 19h7 sufficientwheat together with a small supply received from the Argentine,to give us at that date a stock of about 700,000 tens.   &apos; i hope t   be able to make up the  stock to 775,000 tons - the authorised emergency minimum - by further shipments from theargentine which technically will count as a repayment of partof the loans which I have made to the British Zone of Germany.But the prospects of Canadian shipments for the monthsof July, August and September 19h7, are extremely grave..The United Kingdom receipts of home grown wheat during thefirst two of these months will be small, and in order tomaintain present consumption and build up our stocks to theprudent minimum of 900,000 tons of wheat&quot;and k00,000 tonsof flour before the winter, we need for arrival between the1st July and the 30th September 19u7 1,609,000 tons (wheat equivalent).The Canadians express themselves as quite unable atthis stage to give any firm estimate of the quantities whichthey can ship to us during this period - unofficially theyhave said that the quantity is likely to be negligible.      on being pressed they have suggested as a guess that they mightbe able, over the whole three months, to make available100,000 tons of wheat, but even this very small quantitythey would not guarantee.      I feel that this may be tooconservative and  I have accordingly assumed - I must admitwithout any real justification - that the Canadian Governmentwill find seme way of shipping to us during the three months175,000 tons of wheat and 57,000 tons of flour,, a total of253,000 tons(whoat equivalent  ) giving arrivals of 532,000 tons,after taking into account the estimated quantity likely to beafloat at end June, against our requirement of 1,609,000 tons..It is possible,  that Canada may be able to export to the UnitedKingdom a little more flour than has been allowed for, butthe additional quantity is unlikely to exceed 50,000 tonsover the three months,  and may well be less and I have excludedthis possibility from the calculations at the present time13.    This leaves a deficit of 1,077,000 tons to be met by supplies from other areas or by reducing usage and consumption in this country.      I see no prosxoect of being able to purchase and ship more than about 50,000 tons ofwheat from the Argentine during the three months in question -the Australian supply is fully mortgaged to India and other areas of British responsibility - and the only remainingsource is the U.S.A.      The first part of her new crop movesin the   Southern   States during June/July and some part atleast of the deficit might in theory be met from there.But I do not feel able to place any reliance upon this possibility.      Many claimant countries will be callingmost urgently for wheat during these months not only for        -their immediate nee s, but also to improve their stock positionagainst the contingency of a further world shortage.      Theheavy demands for Japan will also continue to be a factor in these months.      Moreover, the present attitude of theU.S.A.  to this country - and to the London Pood Council Area -in regard to wheat supplies affords little or no ground torhope that they will be willing to deny wheat to other anxiousclaimants in favour of the United Kingdom.      While I believe

that our right course is to stake our full claim at once with the United States, I feel that it would be mostimprudent t;, base our action at this stage on the expectation of American help.      In my judgment v/e must make ready to meetthe deficit out of our own resources.      If American help inthis event is forthcoming we shall be no worse off.      On theother hand,  v/e shall not have lost irreplaceable time in preparing for the worst.11]..    Our position briefly, is that, excluding any quantitywhich coal  be obtained from the argentine, v/e shall have a deficiency in our total wheat/flour supplies up to the 30thSeptember, 191+6 of 1,077,000 tons (wheat equivalent).Thereafter, we are entitled to hope that Canada will be ableto export to us sufficient at least to ease the strain - butthe measure of the relief can only be estimated when more isknown of the 191+6/1+7 overall position.      It must be borne inmind that seaboard stocks in Canada will be insignificantby the time the new crop begins to move.      It is doubtfulwhether in addition to current exports seaboard stocks can be suffiently replenished before the freeze-up in the late autumnto enable Canada physically to ship during th- winter months thefull quantity which, on a purely statistical basis, she willhave available for export.      It cannot,  therefore, be assumed that the United Kingdom will again draw her full requirements from Canada immediately the new crop is harvested and there maybe no very material improvement until the late spring of 191+7.&quot;hieasure s orq-qos ed15.    In the meantime, we have to take such measures as arenecessary to bridge the gap in our supplies.      The sooner webegin to economise the less severe will be the later cut,I propose as the first step to increase the flour extraction rate to 87     on the .29th April and to 90.:, on the 13th May nextand to incorporate barley in the grist to the extent of 8A asfrom the 6th May next.      The practical effect of these proposals will be to reduce our wheat utilisation up to the end of Junewith a corresponding increase of lli+,000 tons in our bulk stock of wheat at the 30th June,  191+6 over and above the prescribedlevel of 775,000 tons making a total of 889,000 tons of wheatplus a &quot;statistical sot aside&quot;  of 62,000 tons (wheat equivalent)of barley.      Before these steps are  actually put into operation,it will be necessary to secure from the Combined Food board a categorical assurance that by thus conserving our resourcesagainst the worse position to come we shall not be called uponto surrender the savings so effected, an automatic resultunder allocation technique ia the absence of such an assurance.Provided that a satisfactory assurance is received, and theabove measures are introduced,  I shall in actual fact -fcecontributing 207,000 tons towards the deficiency of 1,077,000tons up to the 30th September 191+6.      If the net deficiency of 766,000 tons shown in paragraph 17 were met by physicalimports and the higher extraction rate and dilution werenevertheless maintained,  the contribution would be 311,000 ^tons, because I should be milling a greater quantity ox gram.16. This is the practical limit to which I can go. in thedirection of increased extraction, and of dilution for thepresent and with the best will in the world the baker will produce Very poor quality bread -with flour of this content.Most nutritionists would be opposed to an extraction rate inexcess of 90% and it would undoubtedly provoke much publicdissatisfaction.    The introduction of even 90fb extraction flour

may necessitate special measures for the issue of lowerextraction flour on medical certificate to  those sufferingfrom certain diseases.      I regard 8ai as the practical limit for barley dilution at this present stage, although it may be possible to increase the percentage later.      The statisticaltables are, in fact, based upon the assumption that the rate-will be increased to 10: i on the 1st July and to i5% on the1st August,17.    On this basis, I am left with a net deficiency to the&apos;30th September 19M-6 of 766,000 tons to meet, practically all of which must fall into the third Quarter of the year.      Theonly method of saving this quantity is by reducing theproduction by say 25g of biscuits and cereal products such asmacaroni, breakfast foods etc., and by rationing cake and flourconfectionery, flour, breed and oatmeal to the extent necessary to produce the required result.      The overall cutnecessary will be very heavy, representing approximately51% of the wheat/barley utilisation for milling during thepreceding (April/June) quarter.      In practice this means that on average the consumer, who is today eating aboutU-glb of bread and flour a week, will only receive about 2-g-lba week.      Some reduction would be essential in the case of thefighting Services but special enquiry will be necessary on this.Guts in the production rates of biscuits and  cereal productscan be brought into early effect if decided upon.      A scheme forthe rationing of cakes and flour confectionery, flour, bread,and oatmeal is in an advanced stage of preparation and I recommendthat instructions be given that it be finalised, the necessary staff recruited and all printing work put in hand immediately,the deadline for- introduction being the 15th July next.At the same time I should warn my colleagues that the scheme   .-is bound to result in serious loss of productive efficiency and many people will feel hungry most of the time.      This isalmost the latest date which can be afforded in termsof supply considerations.      Our imports after that time willbecome a mere trickle and the loss must be made good weekby week since there is no reserve element in our stocks.Three months is by no moans too long&apos; for all the work- whichhas to be done, and I may have to ask my colleagues forassistance and priority in regard to such matters as papersupplies, printing and labour.      I propose to submit at anearly date the draft rationing scheme, which will be designedto secure the required saving.      If,  contrary to my presentbelief, we obtain an undertaking by the President of theUnited   States to supply to the United Kingdom 766,000 tonsof wheat in June, July and August and physical suppliesbegin to arrive before the 15th July next the rationing-scheme can very simply be suspended and we shall have lostnothing&apos;but the insurance premium.      But if we hesitate and delay action and such hone as we have is not fulfilled weshall lose all control of the position,      I cannot emphasisetoo strongly my belief that we must take immediate action inthe sense of deciding now that the rationing of cake and flour confectionery, flour, bread and oatmeal is to be putinto effect on trie 15th July next and giving all the necessary facilities to enable this to be done.   - It may well be that thiswill force upon us the rationing of potatoes and the differential rationing of the more essential foodstuffs.Appendix III sets out the  statistical position of breadgrain and flour supplies to the 30th April 1947 upon thestated assumptions.

Effect on Animal Feedinp;stuffs18.    The effect of these proposals upon the animalfeedingstuffs scheme will he little short of disastrous.The net&apos; loss to the ration pool up to the 30th September,1946, resulting from the increased&apos;extraction and the barleydilution is approximately 330,000 tons net.      In addition,I fear that we shall lose 332,000 tons of coarse&apos; grain whichI have bought in the Argentine, hut which has not yet been shipped.      The Combined Food Board recently passed aresolution,  the effect of which is to require all countries with unshipped coarse grain purchases in the Argentine to surrender them for use for direct human consumption, the quantities so made available being set off against theWashington allocation.      The amount of the United Kingdomunshipped purchases which were due to arrive- by the end ofSeptember is 240,000 tons and I had been relying upon thesequantities to balance the ration pool account, so enabling meto meet the reduced scales of animal rations for the summerperiod which come into effect on the 1st May 194-6.      Thetotal deficiency in the ration pool to the 30th September, 1946is 542,000 tons.      After taking into account a reduction inthe carry over from 300,000 tons to 200,000 tons. f    Thefeedingstuffs position for the winter rationing pe&apos;period(1st.October 1946 to 30th April 194?)  is obscure.      Whilethe world wheat shortage lasts and international controlcontinues, the first charge upon coarse grain supplies will presumably still be for direct human consumption.      Upon this assumption I see little or no prospect of obtaining overseassupplies for the feeding of United Kingdom livestock and itwould be prudent at this stage to assume that the animalration pool will derive its supplies entirely from -indigenousresources which will have been heavily raided for the barleydilution programme.      Appendix IV sets out the position onthis assumption.      It will he seen that the total available supply, after setting aside the minimum working stockrequired is only 650,000 tons as compared, with requirementson the recently revised scales of animal rations of1,803,000 tons.19.    Some relief to the overall shortage of barley for bread and animal rations could he afforded -&apos;   (a) by making no grain available for whiskyproduction for the year 194-6/47;(b) by cutting&apos; hack beer production to 80% of thepre-war figure in terms of standard barrelage.This would result in a reduction in terms ofbulk barx^elage to 94;&apos;o of pre-war consumptionor to 76% of 1945 consumption.These two measures would save approximately 522,000 tons of barley from 1st May 194.6 to 30th April 1947.      The first course is essential to the bread dilution proposal; the second willbe needed in part for bread dilution and in part in favourof the animal ration pool.      The net deficiency in the animalration pool on this basis would be 1,523,000 tons over thefull twelve months comprising the next summer and winteranimal rationing periods.20.    This heavy reduction in supplies can only be met by acorresponding devaluation of the present coupon values inrespect of the summer rationing period and a drastic revision

of the whole animal rationing -scheme for next winter,resulting in a very serious aggregate loss in supplies of milk,eggs and pig meat.      I propose to consult the Minister ofAgriculture,  the Secretary of State for Scotland and theHome Secretary at an early date on this matter with a viewto the formulation of an agreed scheme for submission toour colleagues.21.    In arriving at the estimates of the supplies which will beavailable for the animal ration pool,  I have had to exclude from the animal ration account, and propose physically toset aside, the balance of the maize at present in this countryand afloat for our starch production for human and essentialindustrial needs.      It is possible that the Combined food board can be persuaded to agree that maize for essentialindustrial needs-falls outside the scope of the Resolutionreferred to in paragraph 18 and in this event, provided thatwe can procure the physical maize needed for starch production,the animal ration pool will benefit by the quantity so procured.22.    In calculating the estimated receipts of home grown wheat and coarse grain,  I have felt it necessary to, make some allowance for the inevitable tendency for farmers to withholddeliveries as an insurance and in some cases to make good some part of the heavy cut in animal feedingstuffs rations which theywill anticipate.      Every effort will have to be made to counterthis tende-iicy but its effect upon the supply position cannot be entirely left out of account.23.    I should perhaps add that in the calculations throughoutthis paper   I have&apos;purposely allowed for a stock of 900,000 tonsof wheat-barley and 1+00,000 tons of flour at the end ofSeptember 19h7.      This was the simplest way of dealing with thenatter statistically but if bread rationing be introduced witha consequent reduction in consumption a smaller working stockwill be needed.      Again it might be possible by closing flourmills and relying to a greater extent upon imported flour,if it could be obtained more readily than wheat, to work ona lower wheat stock.      This of course would result in a greater measure    of unemployment in the mills and a loss of millingoffals.      Clearly however no decisions can be reached on what are complex technical matters until the main lines of our policy are settled.Summary and Recommendations24.    The whole subject is complex and the statistical basisof. this paper is necessarily founded upon a number of assumptionswhich may not be realised.      The position has to he kept under continuous review because the variation of one figure automaticallycalls for the amendment of several others.      I am satisfied thatthis paper gives the broad measure of the problem with which weare faced.      I propose later to submit further papers coveringparticular aspects of the general problem.      There will inevitably be many indirect consequences - labour in the mills, bakeries,&quot;biscuit and other cereal manufacturing plants,  the compound andprovender mills will become redundant, the margings payable tosome of the traders concerned may have to be increased to offset the reduction in throughput and there will inevitably bea substantial reduction in the output of eggs, pig meat and milk.These questions can be dealt with later - the first step is totake decisions on the following proposals, which I recommendniy colleagues to adopt:-

(i) the flour extraction rate to be increased to87^% on the 29th April 1946, and to 90b onthe 13th May, 1946;(ii) dilution of the grist with barley to theextent of Q% as from the 6th May,  1946,provided in both cases,  that, in the meantime,satisfactory assurances have been obtainedfrom the Combined Pood Board that the resultantsaving and stock increase will not be offsetagainst the United Kingdom allocation;(iii) at the earliest practicable date an overallreduction of the order of in the current production of biscuits and minor cerealproducts;(iv) no further grain to be made available fordistilling;(v) a cut in beer production to 80;e of the pre-war production in terms of standard barrclage$(vi)  the introduction of rationing of cake and flour confectionery, flour, bread and oatmealon the 15th July, 1946,  recruitment of necessary staff,  orders for paper supplies, and arrangementsfor printing work being put in hand forthwith.The details of the scheme will be submitted forapproval at an early date.(vii) subject to the outcome of the present negotiations in regard to the 100,000 tons loan,  an approach to the United States Government at the appropriate moment for sufficient wheat for shipment to theUnited Kingdom in the months of July, August and september 1946, to save this country from the disastrous cut in cereals consumption suggested above which will otherwise be necessary.B.S.Ministry of Pood,16th April, 1946.

APPENDIX IIINTERNATIONAL WHEAT POSITIONJuly 1946/June 1947(For.ecas t)1.        In view of the many imponderable factors likely to affect the position in 1946/47,  any forecast made at thisstage must be treated with considerable reserve and shouldbe regarded merely as a rough indication of the possibletrend of events on the basis of certain assumptions.The 1945/46 position has still to resolve itself, a fact -which may well call for some modification in theexisting estimates of wheat quantities may be carried forward for consumption/export in 1946/47,In all instances forecasts of production have hadto be based either on officially recommended targetacreages or on acreages which appear reasonable on present indications.      In many cases,  Spring sowings in the NorthernHemisphere have not yet been undertaken, whilst in the caseof the Southern Hemisphere countries the position is even-more    obscure.Weather conditions during the ensuing few months will play an important part in determining the ultimate size of ava ilab ili ties/requ irements.Considerable uncertainty also surrounds the questionof the domestic utilisation of the crops and the effect which recently introduced conservation measures, ifmaintained, will have on the position of each individualcountry.      Nevertheless,  despite these many obscurities,the following attempt has been made to arrive at a rough assessment of the 1946/47 position.Estimated	wheat	position July/June			1946/47		Canada	J.S.A.

Estimated exportable surplus in the four manorexporting countries(a) U.3.A.      On the basis of latest reports of the .winter wheat crop,  allowing for an averageyield on the spring wheat target acreage and assuming that the conservation measures nowbeing introduced are continued and may he atleast partially effective, it seems reasonable to place their exportable surplus during the season at around. 7.4 million long; tons.(b) Canada.      Whilst the target acreage is officiallyregarded as 23.4 million aores,  our estimate is based on &apos;a figure of 25 millions - privateestimates range from 25 to 28 millions.Long term average yields have been assumedand a moderate reduction in usage for feedand industrial usage has been allowed for.On this basis it appears reasonable to assess

the exportable surplus for the season at about,5 million long tons,  although it should beborne in mind that this crop is not yet inthe ground and weather conditions couldoccasion a considerable variation in thefinal outturn,(c) Australia.      Whilst the announced target acreageis 15.5 million (a revised high figure),doubt exists whether it will in actual fact be attained,  and at this stage,  the Departmentof Commerce and Agriculture is not preparedto assess production at more than 160 million bushels,  although admitting that the presentoutlook for plantings is good and that, given a favourable season, some upward revision maybe warranted.      Utilisation for feed has beenplaced at considerably below the recentdrought seasons, but it is still above pre-war levels.(d) Argentina.      As usual,  considerable obscuritysurrounds the position in Argentina.      On thebasis of a moaerate increase in the &quot;still-to-be-planted&quot; acreage, and assuming averageyields and a reduction to more normal levels in the quantity spoiled and lost throughvarious causes,   it does not appear unreasonable to suggest that,  given the will to export,Argentina should be able to furnish theindicated quantity.Thus,  on the various assumptions,  included in the calculations,  it appears that there may be available forexport from the four major exporting countries mentionedabove during the twelve months July 1946 to June 1947 atotal quantity of 18. 8 million long tons.3.    Requirements of importing countries 1946/47It is not intended to give individual details of thevarious assumptions on which the suggested import requirements are based, except to say that the total figure includes aprovision for Germany of 1,500,000 tons and for Austria of300,000 tons, both figures providing for a calory intake of 1,500 per day.The U.S.S.R.   and the Balkan countries have been regarded as self-sufficient,.  although it is not entirelyunlikely that there may be even some exports forthcomingeventually.      This may especially apply to the U.S.S.R.,who for political reasons, may be prepared to go so faras to sacrifice her own people.

APPENDIX IIIBread. Grain and Flour PositionUnited kingdom pr i1/Sept ember, 1946The attached tables set out the prospective positionin the United Kingdom, based on the assumptions that:-April/September, 1946..&apos; (l)    Shipments equal to the C.F.B. January/June,  1946programme of 2,300,000 tons for U, K.  are actuallyeffected and that partial loan replacement of71,000 tons is set against shipments from Argentina,and that the only shipments to be effected to theU.K.   during July/September 1946 will be limited to175,000 tons of wheat and 57,000 tons of flourfrom Canada.(2)    In view of the expected reluctance of farmers to   &apos;dispose of grain owing to the threat of a seriouscut in feeding rations,  some reduction in receipts of home grown grain will be likely.      (Every effort will be made to prevent such an occurance butmeanwhile it has been deemed advisable to calculate on conservative levels).(3)   As from end-April,  1946 a supply of millable barley-  from M. o.F.  stock,  estimated at 110,000 tons, willbe held in reserve for dilution purposes and thatsubsequent receipts Tzy the Ministry of millablebarley will also be reserved for that purpose.(4)    The quantity of grain milled during the period to15th July 1946 will be sufficient to cover currentunrestricted requirements and that thereafter it is limited to available supplies consistent with anend-September bulk stock of 900,000 tons grain,(wheat equivalent) and 400,000 tons flour.(5)    Dilution with barley will be introduced at thefollowing rates:8fj &quot;during May/June10.&quot;&apos; during July and15/ during August/September(6)    The wheat/flour extractioin rate is raised in two stages to average rate of 90 &quot; as from beginningof May.(7)    The usage of wheat and flour for biscuits and minorcereal   products is cut by 25 - as from end-May.On these assumptions it will he seen that the average rate of milling during the period 15th July to end-Septemberwill represent a cut of approximately 57?&quot;&apos; on thecorresponding figure for the period April to 15th July,1946.

October 194-6/April 1947 Wheat and BarleyThis part of the table is based on what at thisstage can only be very tentative suggestions of whatimported and indigenous supplies might be availablemonth by month having regard to the world positionin general and the indicated severity of the cut infeeding supplies in this country.For tho purposes of the calculations it has been assumed that(l)    Dilution with barley will continue throughoutthe period at B%.(2)    The wheat/flour extraction rate will remain at 90;&apos;?.(3)    The cut in wheat/flour usage for biscuitsetc.  will continue at 25/ as in the June/September period,*(4) The usage of millable barley acquired by theMinistry will continue to be restricted tomilling.It will be seen that supplies estimated to beavailable for dilution will be insufficient to meet requirements,  especially when a uecessarjr provision ismade to cover the contingency of securing additional supplies of wheat from overseas in which case the largerpossible grit would call for a proportionate increasein the tonnage usage of barley.During the period October 1946 to April 1947 thisover-all deficiency in barley supplies may araomit to about212,000 tons.      Adding an estimated deficit of 89,000tons during the subsequent period May/July 1947,  the grandtotal deficiency would amount to 301,000 tons - equalto the originally suggested quantity to be used fordistilling out of the 1946/47 crop.
