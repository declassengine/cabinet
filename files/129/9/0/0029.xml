THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1946.SECEET. Copy No.     3 CP. (46) 179.30th April, 1946.CABINET.CONSTITUTION OF A NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL CONFERENCE.Joint Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council andthe Minister of Labour and National Service.AT their meeting on the 11th April, the Cabinet &quot; invited the Lord President,in consultation with the Minister of Labour, to revise the proposals made inOP. (46) 130 for the constitution of a National Industrial Conference in thelight of the points which had been raised in the Cabinefs discussion.&apos;&apos;* Wehave accordingly given further consideration to the functions and composition of the proposed Conference.2. The function of the Conference would be to provide an effective channelthrough which the Government could discuss economic prospects and policy con-fidentially with both sides of industry, and a basis upon which they could give their considered views for the guidance of industry, so helping to ensure thatthe collective bargaining system operated with the fullest measures of indepen-dence and efficiency. The Conference would play no part in the joint negotiating machinery of particular industries, by which wage agreements must continueto be reached. Its purpose would, in fact, be to reinforce the voluntary demo-cratic character of industrial relations by disseminating the fullest understandingamong both employers and trade unions of the new problems and responsibilitiesinherent in a policy of planned full employment.3. We consider that discussions on the proposal to establish a national industrial Conference would most appropriately be initiated with the national joint Advisory Council, which consists of fifteen nominees each of the TradesUnion Congress and the British Employees Confederation. In view of theresponsibility of the Minister of Labour for wages policy and industrial relationshe would take the initiative in the discussions and in subsequent action. other ministers, and in particular the Lord President of the Council, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade would attend accordingto the subjects under discussion. In addition, officials might join in the more detailed discussions of the Conference.4. The discussions with the National Joint Advisory Council would includethe question of the composition of the body which is to carry out the functionsindicated above. The Council was set up in 1940 by the Ministry of Labour and national Service to consider &quot; all matters in which employers and workers havea common interest,&quot; and it has in the past six years been closely associated withall questions of general policy on wage matters. It is now contemplated that theGovernment^ economic plans should be fully explained to and discussed with both sides of industry, and this represents an extension of the existing co-operationbetween the Government and industry. The National Joint Advisory Council(or its Joint Consultative Committee) could, however, readily be adapted to meetthe requirements set out in this Report. In any event the composition of aNational Industrial Conference would have to be framed on the same basis asthat of the National Joint Advisory Council. Also, in order to facilitate full discussion of confidential information, the Conference should be a small and authoritative body.   The Trades Union Congress and the British Employers&apos;[31743]* CM. (46) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 5.
Confederation could be relied upon to provide channels, through their affiliatedmembers^-for- disseminating the conference&apos;-s joint views-and recommendationsthroughout the country when that was desirable.5. We consider that the important question of associating the Boards ofsocialised industries and Local Authorities with the Conference in their role asemployers might best be put to the National Joint Advisory Council in the firstinstance. If the employers&apos; side cannot suggest an arrangement which would allow adequate representation of socialised industries and Local Authorities, itwill be necessary to consider some form of separate representation within practicallimits. The Co-operative Societies would, in our view, be adequately represented by virtue of their membership of bodies affiliated to or associated with the british employers&apos; Confederation. -6. With regard to the further question of fixing wage levels in socialised industries, Ministers have already agreed that wages and conditions of employ-ment should be settled by negotiation between the Boards acting as employersand representative organisations of workpeople, and that the Government shouldnot assume responsibility in these matters. It may, however, be necessary for theGovernment to promote consultation between the various Boards on wages policy,in addition to arranging for their collective representation on the national industrial Conference.7. It would, in our view, be inadvisable to bring in the Federation of BritishIndustries on questions of wages policy. If production questions arise it mightbe necessary to associate them with the discussions, either directly or through the medium of the National Production Advisory Committee for Industry,8. When the Conference is constituted the broad lines of the agenda for thefirst meetings would be -(a) An assessment of the general economic position and prospects.(b) An outline of the Economic Survey for the ensuing year (the economic development Steering Committee has agreed that this could bediscussed confidentially with representatives of industry).(c) A general discussion of the implications of this Survey.A more detailed agenda would depend upon the outcome of preliminary discussions with the National Joint Advisory Council. The desirability of publishing a White Paper could also be most appropriately considered atthat stage.(Initialled) H. M.G. A. I30th April, 1946.
