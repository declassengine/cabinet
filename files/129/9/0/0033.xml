(46)183..13T MAY., 194,6(Intld. )Ministry of Food?: 1ST-MAY,  1,946*&apos;ANNEXBRITISH FOOD MISSION23rd April,  1946.Dear Minister,I am enclosing with this letter copies of ClintonAnderson&apos;s various communications  to me in the last fewdays.    I don&apos;t think you need trouble to read them all,but I would particularly draw your attention to the penultimate, and the last paragraphs of ^ndersonTs letterof 19th April,  1946.

I imagine you must have teen both confused and irritatedwith what has been going on. here.    Certainly I have been.In broad outline;, however,  the American attitude has beendominated by very simple considerations.    They are - asfollows: -(l)    Since your last visit to Washington,  there has beens great deal of talk by the Americans about what they mightd&quot;o to increase the supply of cereals.    This talk had resulted in little action prior to last week-end,  althoughtwo measures had been instituted which in all probabilitywould have resulted in more grain being available forexport over a period of weeks or months.    These measures were(a) Lengthening the extraction rate to 80 per cent.(b) Offering to pay farmers for their wheat by meansof a certificate which could be cashed at anytime up to the end of March,  1947,  at whateverprice  the farmer thought was the most favourablehe could obtain during that period.jo.ll the^ rest was talk, concentrated mainly upon thepossibilities of imposing a compulsory reduction of2b per cent,  in the consumption of flour.Meanwhile,  U. S.  deliveries for export were continuing to fall behind the oft-proclaimed target ofone million tons oar month.    With the passing of&quot;the weeks, more and more importing countries were using up thelast remnants of their own domestic crops, and were eatinginto their stocks.    The political pressure on theDepartment of Agriculture, and in the State department was mounting, and the Americans were getting more andmore desperate.    For domestic political reasons they feltthemselves rather impotent to take the necessary actions,whereas, when they looked at the outside, world they feltharassed and ashamed of their impotence.(5)      During this period,  it was inevitable that theU.S.A.  and other countries would turn round and exertthe heaviest pressure on the U.K.   to reduce its stocks. .You know what that pressure has boon in London, andI have had an absolutely constant flow of inquiries fromall sources.    Practically none of these I have reported toyou, because to do so would have served no useful purpose.Unfortunately for us, the Americans have the perfectweapon for squeezing.us,  if they will.    All they need to dois to give us nothing out of U.S.A. supplies for India,other L.F.C. areas,  or the Brutish Zone &quot;of Germany,    We havehad to counter this pressure as best we could.    The chiefweapon,  of course,  has been to try to get the Americans tostate openly and officially what is the justification ofdenying&quot; supplies to,  say,  India or the British Zone, whenthey are shipping to the American Zone of Germany and to japan.    We received somewhat of a setback owing to the-uncertainties of the actual requirements of the british zone of Germany, but Frank Hollins1  visit,  and thediscussion which took place when he was here, have cleared up that problem.(4)    The position last Friday and Saturday,  19th and 20thApril, was really quite extraordinary.      The Americanssuddenly decided that they had. to do something.    There wasa two-hour Cabinet meeting on Saturday morning, and

various decisions were taken, which we have reported to you.We don&apos;t yet know what precisely will he the effect ofthose decisions, hut if they don&apos;t &quot;bring more supplies tothe seaboard,  I don&apos;t know what will - in this country.The measures are much more extensive than we thought wouldhave been taken.    As we told you, we think they are probably the most effective, in the short run, which could be taken.However,  it is most improbable that these measures will result in greatly increased supplies coming to seaboardwithin the next three or four weeks.    There will,  therefore,be continuing and most acute needs to be met.    It is justpossible that the temporary price increases for wheat andcorn which have been promised here will result in an actualslowdown of the Canadian movement of wheat off the farm,&apos; unlessthe Canadian Government gives some  similar bribe to theCanadian farmer.    The Canadians are much worried about thismatter,  and I know are considering at the moment whatthey can do about it.We are all quite confident, therefore, that there is going to be no escape during the next few weeks from the continuing pressure upon us.Up to the present, thanks to the various actions you have taken - and if I may say so, with modesty,  thanks to theway we have played the hand here - we have managed to retain the initiative, and to keep the public pressure - I repeat,the public pressure - on the U.S. Administration to do more,rather than upon the U.K.    The rationing proposal made avery good public reaction,  although I believe the precisewording of it caused considerable annoyance to the WhiteHouse.    The diversion offer then again enabled, us to stealthe limelight, and in effect gave the Americans no option but to agree substantially to our replacement terms.    i know they felt that the terms&apos; were pretty stiff.    Theyabsolutely accepted our position, that.we cannot be expectedto part with any supplies that we have unless we receiveassurances about the future, but I know they feel that wehave rather forced them to agree to our proposals on this occasion, and when we come along later -- as we shall have todo - like Oliver Twist who asked for more,  they will certainly wish, to obtain from us something in the natureof a reduction in stocks.    Clinton Anderson was veryexplicit about this when I met him yesterday inMike Pearson&apos;s office.However, when we come to consider the supplies we need to get in August and September from.the U.S.A.&apos;l myselffeel much more confident.    On present expectations, they are going to have a lot of wheat moving,  and we should be able tomake substantial shipments if we have to.    The difficult period is going to be May and June,  and the early days ofJuly.     If the Canadians can really deliver the normalamount of flour,  and between 285,000 and 300,000 tons ofwheat to the U.K.  in May and June, then perhaps it won&apos;t beso bad.    Certainly the Canadians,  as always, will do their best.    But the next round with the Americans is going tobe quite a tussle, I am afraid.    I&apos;am therefore waitingwith interest the results of the Gabinefs decision, which no doubt will be taken today or tomorrow, and of which-probably l shall have learned before you receive this letter.

The only thing I should add to explain the happeningsof the week-end is that up until h o&apos;clock on Saturdaythe American Administration really didn&apos;t know very &quot;well whatadministrative measures they were going to take.    ChesterBowles and Paul Porter agreed to the wheat and corn price increases only at ahout 6 o&apos;clock in the evening, when was sitting in Clinton Anderson&apos;s office.    It was then15 minutes before Anderson had to go to the White House tosee the President,  and one hour before their broadcast.These decisions that were taken late on Saturday nighthave substantially altered the American psychology, atleast for the moment, and makes them more than evenconvinced that (a) they have done their utmost;    (b) towardsthe end of May and through June and July, they will havesubstantially&apos; increased quantities of grain for export,and will fully meet their six-months&apos; target of six million tons, and (c) they are in an even better position than beforeto give us assurances regarding future supplies if we willcontinue to do what, with considerable insolence, theycall &quot;our share&quot;.    It is very difficult,  isnH it, not to lose one&apos;b temper.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    MAURICE I. HUTTON.-k-

DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTURE- Washington19th April,  1946.Dear Mr.  Hutton,With further reference to the letter which I sent youyesterday dealing with the subject of diversion of wheatshipments and our telephone conversation in which I assured you that on my arrival in the office today I would try to make the reply somewhat more specific,  I desire now to answer yourmemorandum of 17th April.If His Majesty&apos;s Government diverts 200,000 tons of wheator flour in the balance of April and early May from shipmentsafloat to the United Kingdom or from the United Kingdom stocks,we will undertake the following;(a) The Government of the United States will undertaketo replace to the United Kingdom in the form ofwheat and by shipment not later than 31st July,  1946,the 200,000 tons diverted or shipped from UnitedKingdom stocks.    We would like to make this reservation,  however,  namely that our harvests of winter wheat are now scheduled to be a littleearlier than usual and if so v/e could probablymeet this commitment prior to 31st July.    But ifwe found it impossible to harvest and get toshipside the quantities specified,   every effort would be made to see that any slipping would bemet in the very first days of August.(b) We would agree that the replacement of thesequantities should not have the effect of reducingUnited Kingdom allocations during the balance ofthe second quarter or during the third quarter of1946.(c) In addition to the 200,000 tons mentioned above,the Government of the United States would undertaketo provide for shipment to the united Kingdom duringthe closing days of July or the first few days ofAugust 1946 such quantities of wheat as might benecessary to meet any shortfall in Canadian exportsto the United Kingdom during the month of July,which would result in the Canadian government being unable to maintain their present programof approximately 400,000 tons per month (wheat equivalent) to the United Kingdom.(d) It is understood that our discussion of the offer madeby His Majesty&apos;s Government involves the diversion of shipments afloat or exports from the UnitedKingdom of Canadian wheat or flour,   and that therefore the agreement&apos;to the Canadian Government will berequired,  both as to the destination to which thediversions or exports from the United Kingdom aremade,  and as to the terms of which the receivingcountry makes payment.Ill

The comments in (d),  however,  should not be regarded asan understanding that the United Kingdom and the canadian government by themselves will determine the places or countriesserved by this diversion.    The Government of the United states would point out that in the proposals advanced by you at the combined Pood Board meeting 11+0,000 of the 200,000 tons werebeing sent to areas of more or less British responsibility,such as India,  the British zone of Germany,  and South ^frica,and that in reality we had previously anticipated that yourstocks would be reduced to some extent to serve these areas.Therefore,  we seem to be gaining 60,000 tons for UNRRA now and the United States alone seems to be agreeing to replaceit with 200,000 tons in July,   end possibly an additional200,000 tons or more if the Canadian Government is unable to ship at that time.When I discussed your general proposal with the president and some members of his Cabinet this morning,  the question was raised at once if we were gaining 60,000 tons for the troublesof a hungry world and committing ourselves to ship from ourwinter wheat crop a total of from 1+00,000 to 600,000 tons.I can&apos;t help but feel that the United Kingdom is going to want to make an effort to reduce its stocks even more before we arethrough with our present difficulties, but I did want to pointout to you this feeling which I encountered in the cabinet meeting and of which I think you would want to be advised.Sincerely yours,(Signed)    CLINTON ANDERSONSecretary.DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTUREWashington18th April,  19h7.Dear Mr.  Hutton,It is my understanding that your government stands readyto divert up to 200,000 tons of wheat which it now has in itsstocks,  or which it may have afloat or scheduled for loading,to UNRRA and to various other claimants such as India,  SouthAfrica,,   and the British-occupied zone of Germany.Naturally,  the British Government,  before it diverts or dipsinto its stocks, would want to know what would happen to thefuture flow of wheat from North America.    It is my understandingthat the Canadians will be prepared to take care of yourrequirements during May and June,  but that there is apossibility that wheat stocks will be at low levels during July,August,  and the first few weeks of September.    Naturally, under those circumstances,  you would turn to the United States tofind what our situation might-be.

tp ^ with hi a.If your government would, make available up to 200,000 tonsof wheat immediately and permit it to reach those areas where the combined Pood Board would&quot;&quot; agree the needs are extremely urgent and must have further attention,  then I could assure you of my government&apos;s intention to ship you at the earliest possible time a substantial quantity of wheat from its new crop.    Our winterwheat this year gives promise of being a bumper crop of some830 million bushels and it also is a little ahead of its normalseason.    We look for early and substantial harvest.    Our loadingsmay be late in July and our position will be far better inAugust,  but we feel that you can make special arrangements forthe transportation of grain to you.We would therefore undertake to supply any short fall inyour requirements that might occur as a result of the inability of Canada to meet your usual needs during July.Sincerely yours,(Signed)     CLINTON ANDERSONSecretary.DEPARTMENT OP AGRICULTUREWashington18th April,  191+6.Dear Mr.  Hut ton,On behalf of the Government of the United States,  I desireto take up with you the question of conservation of wheat supplies and particularly the offer of the British Government made10th April to ration bread in Great Britain if the United states would take that same step or a comparable one.We are now prepared to put into effect an order limitingdomestic-consumption of flour to 75 per cent of the amountconsumed in the corresponding month of 191-1-5.    Our surveys showthat flour consumption during the first two months of 191+6 was upabout 5 or 6 per cent over corresponding months in 191+5.    Therefore,a cut to 75 per cent of the amount consumed in 191+5 would be ineffect a reduction of more than 25 per cent in the current domestic consumption.    This follows the establishment of a raise in thewheat extraction ratio to 80 per cent,I wish you would ask your government if it would regard theinstitution of this limitation on the domestic consumption of flourto be comparable step to the one heretofore proposed by your government,  namely bread rationing.    We do not desire to rationbread,  but we do desire to reduce the consumption of flour and we feel this step is comparable to what.your government proposed.Canada has agreed to comparable steps.    Are you prepared to go ahead with similar conservation of cereals?Sincerely yours,(Signed)    CLINTON ANDERSONSecretary.

DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTUREWashington18th April,  1946.Dear Mr,  Hutton,I am sending you today two letters - one covering theproposal of the United States Government toward the institution of additional measures for the conservation of wheat through a limitation on the distribution of flour to  the domestictrade,   and the other dealing with the diversion of up to200,000 tons of grain in order that extreme emergency needsof various countries and claimants to UNRRA may be met.In that connection I would like to urge you as stronglyas I can to plead that your government be as liberal aspossible with the amount of this diversion that would go toUNRRA.     I would be very happy if at least 100,000 tons couldbe made available to UNRRA at once from.loadings afloat orscheduled for U. K.    I know that this is more that your government desires to make available to UNRRA because of responsibilities which I recognize as valid.    At the sametime,   our situation is going to be very much more complicatedin this country if additional supplies are not immediately available to UNRRA and if we do not eventually work out a far more satisfactory allotment for the second quarter of I9I+6.As you know, we have discussed adding 61x2,000 tons to therequirements and of this amount about 275,000 tons would go toUNRRA.    Then if we reduced by 10 per cent the amounts to allclaimants,  which was your informal proposal of yesterdayafternoon and which our working party is now examining forits feasibility,  we would cut UNRRA in total about 10 per cent of 650,000 or 65,000 tons.    That means that the net additionto the UNRRA allocation would be about 210,000 tons.I would like to tell UNRRA now that it is going to get100,000 tons immediately and that proper diversions can bemade at once from shipments Intended for Britain.    We wouldthen be able to work out any further relief as we deal withthe problems of the claimants to the 61x2,000 tons,  and itwell might be that we could get UNRRA another 110,000 tons,making 210,000 in all.    I would not say that we could make that commitment at the present time,  but if we could tellUNRRA that 100,000 tons were absolutely available,  it wouldbe good news to the Director General of UNRRA,  and I think itwould be a splendid thing as far as the total effect on thewhole picture is concerned.We are having to do a great many things on faith thesedays.    My whole commitment to you. on the question of shipmentsduring July to take care of any short fall from Canadian ship-ments is based on faith.    I am confident that it will be adhered to completely and without any equivocation or delay.By the same token I think -that you and I could agree that we might be able to so stretch things to make this 100,000 toncommitment to UNRRA,  feeling sure that we can work out within&apos;the framework of the whole operation of the Combined PoodBoard enough Wheat to cause the United Kingdom no difficultybecause of its present diversion.

O 9 ^h u *JI ask you to present this to your government as stronglyas you can,  realizing that it is part and. parcel of the wholethree-cornered transaction by which we hope to conserve the grain supplies of the United States and Canada as exportingnations and of the United Kingdom and various other countries as importing nations and that through this and other means we hope to bring a better supply of cereals to many areas which otherwise might suffer from extreme starvation.Sincerely yours,(Signed)    CLINTON ANDERSONSecretary.
