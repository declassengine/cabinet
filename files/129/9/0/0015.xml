Introduction.MY purpose in this paper is to summarise the salient features of this question,to describe developments during recent months and to examine a number of alternative solutions. Facts and figures on the population and finance are givenin Annexes A and B.2. The major points on which any consideration of this question must bebased will appear in the course of what follows; but its primary importance to uslies in the fact that these territories are at present in our possession by right ofconquest and are under British military administration, and that they flank themain line of Imperial communication between the United Kingdom, India,Australia and New Zealand. The war with the Axis has demonstrated theirstrategic importance and any decision as to their disposal must be closely related to the broad question of Imperial Defence.3. It is my wish, before His Majesty&apos;s Government in the United Kingdomcome to any decision on the policy to be adopted, to confer with my Dominioncolleagues so that we may agree on a policy which will not only satisfy the interestsof the British Commonwealth, but will also take into account the necessity of arriving at a practical solution and of obtaining the acceptance of the major powers, so far as is possible, and of the inhabitants of the territories themselves.4. The advantages and disadvantages of arriving at an immediate solutionare examined in paragraphs 20-23. Whether it is wise or not to delay the finalinternational arrangement disposing of these territories, it is at least imperativein my view that we should decide urgently in our own minds what our immediatepolicy is to be. I cannot over-emphasise the responsibility which the Governmentof the United Kingdom is bearing in its present administration of these territories and if it should be decided to postpone decision on the policy to be adopted we shallstill have to decide in what form this administration is to continue.5. There are in my view two questions of great urgency which have to bedecided as quickly as possible, even if it is resolved to hold over any decisionon the whole problem of the Italian Colonies to a later date :- (1) Our present position in the Ogaden and the Reserved Area, which are both territories under Ethiopian sovereignty, is dependent on a treaty with Ethiopia which expires next March. It has to be decided, there-fore, whether, in order to obtain our objectives in East Africa, weshould proceed at once to negotiate an agreement with the Emperor of ethiopia.(2) The problems of the present administration of the Italian Colonies are discussed more fully in this paper. The urgent question at the moment is to decide how the administration is to continue if we feel it is wise to maintain it for any protracted period. There are not only acutedifficulties of staff. There are grave dangers of trouble, particularlyin Libya, if His Majesty&apos;s Government continue to make no declara-tion of policy which satisfies to some extent the heavy pressure which13270   [31678] &apos; B
the inhabitants themselves are putting on the administration. If nosuch declaration is made, it is inevitable that our popularity will wane,and that the inhabitants will add violence to their pressure, andand ultimately it may be impossible to put through any proposals onwhich we may finally decide. At the same time it must be borne inmind that we are bound under International Law to pursue a policyof Care and Maintenance, and any unilateral action which we may take must be such as not to have International repercussions, thatwould equally render impossible the application of our final proposals.6.   On those two points an early decision is required.   The broader question&apos; of the final settlement is one which needs yet more careful consideration, and inthis paper I have attempted to set out the advantages and the disadvantages of thealternative proposals which have been made.II. Retrospect.His Majesty&apos;s Government&apos;s Commitments.7. His Majesty&apos;s Government, up to September of last year, had entered intothe following commitments : (i) On the 8th January, 1945, the then Secretary of State said in the Houseof Commons : &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government are determined that at theend of the war the Senussis in Cyrenaica will in no circumstancesagain fall under Italian domination.&quot; In addition, in 1940 General(now Field-Marshal) Wilson told an assembly of Senussi Chiefs : &quot; Weshall co-operate .... so that the Arabs may be entitled to regaintheir freedom and take back their lands from Italian oppressors andrestore their independence once more.&quot;(ii) They are committed to consultation with the British Somalis by pledges given in Parliament that their status would not be changed without consultation.(iii) They are morally bound to consider the interests and wishes of theinhabitants of the former Italian Colonies and, in particular, theysubscribed to the Declaration in the San Francisco Charter (Article 73)in recognising the principle &quot; that the interests of the inhabitants of these territories are paramount &apos;&apos; and of accepting &apos;&apos; theobligation .... to develop self-government, to take due account ofthe political aspirations of the people and to assist them in the progressive development of their free political institutions.&quot; Theinhabitants, in particular of Libya, have been given to believe thatthey will be formally consulted before any decision is taken on their future.Council of Foreign Ministers, September 1945.8. Before the meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in September theBritish ideas for the future of the Italian Colonies were as follows : (a) Tripolitania to be placed under international trusteeship with Italy asAdministering Authority.(6) Cyrenaica to be placed under international trusteeship with the UnitedKingdom as Administering Authority.(c) Italian Somaliland, together with British Somaliland, the Ogaden and the reserved Areas, to be placed under international trusteeship with theUnited Kingdom as Administering Authority.(d) Eritrea to be given to Ethiopia, except for the North-Western Lowlandswhich were to be joined to the Sudan.These proposals were not submitted to the Council of Foreign Ministers inSeptember because the situation was radically altered by the presentation of theUnited States plan for Collective Trusteeship and the Soviet demand forTripolitania.9.   The United States proposals are as follows :  (a) Libya will be granted independence at the end of ten years. In the interval it will be under a U.N.O. trusteeship agreement. This willprovide for an administrator with full executive power appointed by
and responsible to the Trusteeship Council of U.N.O. To him will beattached an Advisory Committee of seven composed of representativesof the United Kingdom, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,France, Italy and the United States and a European and an Arabresident of Libya selected by the five Governments named.(6) Eritrea will be accorded the same treatment as in the ease of Libya, theAdvisory Committee in this case, however, to include two residents ofEritrea appointed by the five Governments. There will, however, bea territorial cession in favour of Ethiopia which will give Ethiopiaaccess to the sea through the port of Assab.(c) In the case of Italian Somaliland, there will be a similar trusteeshiparrangement, without, however, any fixed date for independence.There will be an administrator appointed by and responsible to the trusteeship Council of U.N.O. and an Advisory Committee including two residents of Somaliland in addition to the representatives of thefive Governments named.(d) In the case of all three colonial areas, the Security Council of LT.N.O.may, if it deems necessary, select strategic points for administra-tion by it as strategic areas in the interest of world security.10. The Cabinet decided to give the American proposal conditional support for the following reasons : (a) The probable effect on public opinion in this country;(b) The proposal provided a means of dealing with the embarrassingRussian request for sole trusteeship over Tripolitania;(c) The importance of assisting the United States Administration to engageAmerican responsibility in this field, while public opinion in theUnited States was in the mood.The decision of the Cabinet was made on the assumption that, if the UnitedStates plan was accepted, the United States would play its part. This, it waspointed out, was vital.11. The decision of the Council of Foreign Ministers in September wasto refer to the Deputies &quot; for preliminary consideration the matter of trustee-ship for the Italian Colonies, suggesting that they should make the widest usepossible of the proposals of the United States Delegation and take into account the views expressed by the other Delegations . , . .&quot; and &quot;asked the Deputiesto present their report on this question to the Governments members of theCouncil not less than fourteen days before the opening of the next PlenaryConference of the Council.&quot;Vieivs of other Governments.12. The French advocate Italian trusteeship over all the Colonies, subject tocertain territorial rectifications with adjacent French territory.13. Egypt considers that a plebiscite should be held in Libya and would welcome any of the following solutions : a free and independent Libya whichcould become a member of the Arab League; incorporation in Egypt; or anInternational Trusteeship to be exercised by Egypt or the Arab League. TheseEgyptian proposals have been endorsed by other Arab States.14. The Emperor of Ethiopia has * lid claim to both Eritrea and italian somaliland and recently despatched representatives to discuss with the ForeignOffice the whole question of Ethiopia&apos;s frontiers. The Ethiopian ForeignMinister was informed that His Majesty&apos;s Government wished to solve theProblem of the grazing grounds of the British Somali tribes which lay inEthiopian sovereign territory, and that the solution which His Majesty&apos;s Govern-went put forward in the interests of the inhabitants was the unification of all theSomali territories, and that if the Emperor was prepared to consider this solution&quot;ivourably it would be easier for His Majesty&apos;s Government to support Ethiopia&apos;sclaims to Eritrea,Views of the Government of South Africa.15. The South African Government transmitted on the 20th September, 1945,a memorandum which stated that in their view &apos;&apos; the chief issue of the disposal^ the Italian Colonies is whether or not the protection of the strategic Empire.ltQwte through the Mediterranean and Red Sea is to be maintained or abandoned.&quot;to continued that the future control of strategic bases in Cyrenaica and Italian[31678] 6 2
Somaliland should contain an effective guarantee to the British Commonwealththat the danger it had to fight against during the last two wars should not occuragain, and that, as a result of Russia&apos;s expansion in the Near East, to place the Colonies under international control would expose the Arabs to increasedSoviet influence. The memorandum concludes that the Red Sea communications are as important as ever and that therefore in order to reconcile British strategic interests with the United States proposal for Collective Trusteeship Cyrenaica should be retained under strategic control either (i) as a British strategic base under the Security Council; or(ii) by granting independence to the Senussi and making a treaty with them under agreement with the Security Council; or(iii) by putting it under Egyptian administration on condition that themilitary clauses in the Egyptian Treaty applied to Cyrenaica.Tripolitania should either be returned to Italy and demilitarised or placed under International Trusteeship.Eritrea should be given to Abyssinia and the Somali territories unified under british mandate.16. In a message addressed to me on the 6th October, 1945, Field-marshal smuts pointed out that &quot; Russia had had her reward for her enormous efforts inEurope. Why should the British Commonwealth not have theirs for theirimmense efforts in Africa and the Mediterranean basin and elsewhere ? We areprepared also to concede to the United States of America much of a free hand byway of strategic bases in the Pacific. She should loyally support us in our vitalAfrican interests,.&quot; and should appreciate &quot;that ours is not a mere selfish interest,but a vital necessity of future world balance and world peace.&quot; In another contextField-Marshal Smuts stated that Eritrea should only be given as trust territory to Ethiopia on condition that the United States accept the Massawa area as a security base, since it is in British interests to associate the United States in thisall-important line of communication.17. At the end of January a message was received from Field-marshal smuts setting out his views in the light of current developments on the threeprincipal objectives to be achieved in the disposal of the Italian Colonies (a) to exclude Russia from any share in the Italian Colonies whatever;(b) to preserve British strategic interests in North and East Africa;(c) to win the lasting friendship of Italy.Field-Marshal Smuts concludes that the United States plan is dangerous toBritish interests, and urges strongly that we should &apos;&apos; play for time (he mentionsa period of five years) rather than commit ourselves to steps which we may regretin future.&quot; In his view we should keep Cyrenaica and Tripolitania for the timebeing, with a view to restoring at any rate Tripolitania to Italy under trustee-ship : meanwhile we should appeal to the United States to adopt a helpfulattitude to us over the Italian Colonies, just as we are doing with the UnitedStates over Pacific territories.18. At a meeting in the Dominions Office on the 15th February the repre-sentatives of the Dominions associated themselves with Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;view that the Mediterranean-Red Sea communications were of vital importance and also shared his concern at the expansion of Russian influence in this area.III.- Undesirability of Delaying Tactics.19. The various proposals which have been made for the disposal of theItalian Colonies reveal two principal differences of approach. Certain of thempostulate that an immediate international agreement should be arrived at, while others maintain that decision on their future must be delayed.20.   The arguments for delay are (1) The international situation is so confused that it is preferable to wait until it clarifies before arriving at any decision.(2) It is still uncertain whether the United Nations Organisation is capableof bearing the great responsibility of colonial administration in thisperiod of its perilous infancy, and whether therefore any of the italian colonies can safely be entrusted to its charge under collectivetrusteeship.
21. On the other hand, there is no advantage in playing for time unless we are likely to be in a better position to attain our objectives at the end ofthe time gained than we are at present. Delay might see Russia better placedin a few years time for asserting her aims in the Mediterranean and Levant,and the United States might be even less willing than now to share in responsibility in this area. It is therefore unsafe to assume that delay would improve our chances of keeping Russia out of Africa.22.   Delay would, moreover, have the following serious disadvantages :  (i) If we refuse to discuss final arrangements for the Italian Colonies, theRussians will probably retaliate hy refusing to commit themselves onthe future of the Dodecanese and even on the Italian Peace treaty as a whole, while throwing on us the odium of obstructing a settlement,(ii) The United Kingdom would bear an increasingly burdensome adminis-trative and financial responsibility for the colonies. There are alreadyacute difficulties over staff which are increasing as demobilisationproceeds.(iii) The uncertainty about the future complicates the task of the british military Administrators and affords in the administered territories,and in the Middle East generally, grounds for criticism and intriguewhich are likely to become increasingly embarrassing and to makethe final settlement more difficult. The longer that British tutelagelasts the greater will nationalist feeling grow, and after a numberof years it might become impossible to impose any settlement whichcould be agreed internationally. It is probable also that Libya may become infected with the Soviet propaganda that is active in theMiddle East, and that Ethiopia will stir up trouble in Eritrea andItalian Somaliland.(iv) Finally our present position in the Ogaden and the Reserved Areas hasa definite time limit. It depends on the Anglo-Ethiopian Agreementof December 1944, which was secured only in the face of very keenopposition and which expires in March 1947. Failure to conclude anew Agreement with Ethiopia on the future of Italian East Africamight result in British troops continuing to occupy the Ogaden andthe Reserved Areas beyond the time-limit of March 1947. We should then be in precisely the same position as Russia has been in recent weeks with regard to Persia. Moreover, the United States Govern-ment recognise Ethiopia&apos;s frontiers as those of 1935 and do notconsider that there is any dispute regarding them. Unless we canpush through our plan for a unified Somalia before the expiry of thepresent agreement, we shall never do so, unless we are prepared to involve ourselves in serious international complications, includingperhaps the loss of American sympathy.23. These are strong arguments for reaching a settlement now. But it isalso becoming.urgent to state our position in the discussion of the Italian peace treaty. The American Delegation have maintained their earlier proposals andhave elaborated them without, however, giving any precise idea of how theywould work in practice. The French Delegation has maintained that trusteeshipover all the colonies should be exercised by Italy. The Russian Delegation hasrepeated its claim to individual trusteeship over Tripolitania, stating that itwould agree to Collective Trusteeship for the other three colonies. It is under-stood that Mr. Dunn recently informed M. Gousev that the United States Govern-ment could not support a claim by any one of the Big Four to Individual Trustee-ship over any of the colonies. Whilst the United Kingdom Deputy has attempted to postpone any decision on the future arrangements in the Colonies by takingthe line that this was a matter which could be considered at leisure and that theonly immediate decision required was agreement on a provision in the ItalianTreaty that Italy should renounce her sovereignty over the colonies, it is now clear that the United States and Soviet Governments at least are not preparedto defer discussion of the future arrangements, and in view of the instructions given to the Deputies by the Council in September (see paragraph 11) it is becoming increasingly difficult for His Majesty&apos;s Government to refuse to take part in such discussion. According to these instructions, the Deputies&apos; reporttt- tS- - e ^een available hJ the 15th April, and it is therefore necessary thatHis Majesty&apos;s Government should contribute to the discussion of this question as early as possible.
Our Objectives.24. As I have stated above, the question of the Italian Colonies is closely related to that of Imperial Defence. In my view it is essential that we should maintain our position in the Mediterranean and Red Sea. It is not only aquestion of preserving this life-line in time of war, but also the vital importanceof acting in peace-time on the soft under-belly of Europe from the MediterraneanIf we maintain our position along this life-line, the stability of the Middle Eastgenerally will be an essential factor. The attitude of the neighbouring arab states is, therefore, important in its relation to the future of the Italian colonies and the solution must not be one which will disturb our relations with thosecountries. If, as I believe, we should develop British East Africa as a strategic reserve without renouncing our position in the Middle East, our approach to theproblem of the Italian Colonies must be based on : (i) denial of these Colonies to any hostile influence, and perhaps even(ii) retention by us of certain strategic facilities at key points.In my view, therefore, unless the decision is taken to renounce our position in theMediterranean and the Middle East we must agree to no solution which does notfulfil (i) above and it may also be desirable to satisfy the requirements of (ii).25.   Therefore, as I see it, our main aims must, therefore, be : (a) to arrive at a settlement which satisfies the interests of imperial defence;(&amp;) to prevent the Russians gaining control of any one of the colonies, andto reduce to a minimum their share in any international arrangements and their opportunities for interference;(c) to sponsor a settlement which will meet, to the fullest extent practicablethe needs and wishes of the inhabitants of the ex-Italian Colonies,i.e. (i) self-government for Libya;(ii) a united Somalia;(iii) the fusion of the major part of Eritrea (i.e., excluding the Moslemarea) with Ethiopia;(d) to secure united States support.26. I believe that even if it were possible to dispose of the Italian colonies in opposition to the United States, that it would be most undesirable from every point of view that Ave should attempt to do so. In order to secure United states support it&quot; is essential for me not to go back on my decision in September toaccept the United States plan in principle, subject to certain modifications andfurther examination of its practical application. I am not, perhaps, committed to support of this plan in its entirety since if it proves impracticable I will bejustified in recommending its abandonment, but I am committed to giving it veryserious consideration and I do not believe that we would obtain the support ofthe United States if we did not at least accept as starting-point the principles on which the American Collective Trusteeship proposals are based, namely : (i) that there should be no imperialist exploitation of the ex-italian colonies;(ii) that the independence of the inhabitants should be recognised as soon aspracticable.Principal Alternative Solutions : General.27. The solutions which present themselves can be based in the case of each territory on the following four general principles : -(a) the principle of Collective Trusteeship (as proposed by the UnitedStates);(&amp;) the principle of Individual Trusteeship by a Power other than Italy (onwhich were based the British ideas of last September, the Russianclaim to Tripolitania, and the proposals made by Field-marshal smuts);(e) the&apos;restoration of her Colonies in some form to Italy (as proposed by theFrench Government and in the case of Tripolitania only, by theBritish plans which were not tabled at the Foreign Ministers&apos;Conference in September);
(d) the recognition of local independence either by the creation of newStates (as suggested for Cyrenaica by Field-Marshal Smuts, para. 15above) or by the transfer of certain territories to the States to whichthey naturally belong.A. Collective Trusteeship.28. The advantages and disadvantages of the American proposals for collective Trusteeship lie principally in its possible methods of application.The American proposals aim at avoiding the projection of Great Power politicsinto the Italian Colonies. It is for this reason that the plan lays down thatTrusteeship should be exercised not by the Four Great Powers but by U.N.O.acting collectively through the organ of the Trusteeship Council. If as a resultof its application the plan leads to the introduction of a number of nationalsfrom the Great Powers, there are clearly strong objections to it. It is inevitable that the nationals of certain Great Powers, and particularly Russia, will not beinternationally minded, but will merely be the instrument of that State&apos;s powerpolitics and also probably the disseminators of propaganda.29. Moreover, as pointed out by the French Deputy, the system of CollectiveTrusteeship is a new conception which would place a considerable burden on theUnited Nations, itself an unfledged organisation. Its practical application would need, therefore, to be worked out very carefully. Considerable study has beengiven to this problem by an inter-departmental working party in Whitehall, whohave reported that the United States proposals are feasible if the following pointsare all satisfactorily covered in the practical application of CollectiveTrusteeship : (i) The &quot; Advisory Committees &quot; of the United States plan would have tobe eliminated as they would be likely to lead to a clash of responsibility,to project into each territory Great Power rivalry (which it isprecisely the object of the Americans to avoid), and at the same timeto provide the U.S.S.R. with opportunities for direct interference.The United States Deputy, no doubt aware of this danger, has nowindicated that the Committee&apos;s powers would be very limited,(ii) Wide authority would have to be given to the man on the spot.(iii) An international Colonial Service would be required to ensure continuity of policy and administrative efficiency.(iv) The arrangements for each territory would have, moreover, to take account of local conditions and would thus vary widely. where possible, elaborate machinery superimposed from outside should be avoided, and we should seek instead to build on whatever already exists locally, reinforcing it at the beginning if need be with outsidetalent, but striving from the very start to make the maximum use oflocal institutions and local personnel. The United States memorandumproposes a standard plan to be applied in all territories alike, and inthis respect will thus require substantial modification.30. In general, therefore, Collective Trusteeship, if suitably modified, mightbe the form of International Trusteeship least open to the dangers of Great Powerpolitics.B. Individual Trusteeship.31. The principle of Individual Trusteeship is open to several very serious objections. It is true that the British Commonwealth has a better claim than any other Power to be awarded the individual trusteeship of one or more of theItali an colonies, which they conquered almost alone and which have endowedwith an efficient British administration ever since. But a reversion to the idea of individual Trusteeship would certainly give strength to the Russian claim toTripqlitania. It is imperative to exclude Russia from the large share in thecolonies which she would be able to claim if either Individual or Four-PowerTrusteeship was applied. Whilst trusteeship by a group of Powers might in theory be acceptable, it would in practice be very difficult to exclude in every casethe U.S.S.R. from such a group, and by adopting this principle we should thusrun the grave risk of giving the U.S.S.R. a largei^share than she will enjoy undera system of Collective Trusteeship. 1 -32. Moreover, the Commonwealth would be exposed once more to a chargeof imperialism if any part of the Italian Colonies were placed under British rule.
The international implications of a request for British trusteeship over any ofthe territories must thus be balanced against the strategic advantages which wewould thereby acquire. Such a request would not obtain the support of theUnited States Government, since, as mentioned above, the American Secretary ofState&apos;s Deputy in London has stated that they could not support a claim by anyone of the Big Four to Individual Trusteeship over any of the Colonies. Trustee-ship by one of the British Dominions would probably be regarded as a subterfugeof British imperialist interests, and would equally not receive United states support.C. Restoration to Italy.33. The return to Italy of her Colonies might help to make her a friendly and sound democratic Power in the Mediterranean. On the other hand her Empirewas an economic liability to her and provided her with little outlet for emigration.Its loss would thus cause no serious injury to her economy and might in factrelieve her of a burden which, in her present financial position, she might be unable to bear. Moreover, the populations of all the colonies, whatever their differences, are united in their hostility to Italy and restoration of Italian rule in any form could only be enforced with great difficulty, perhaps only by forceof arms. Finally, any effort to restore it by force would have most unfortunate results on our position in Egypt and the whole of the Middle East.D. Independence or Union with natural motherland.34. The recognition of local independence is a question which must bediscussed in its relation to each territory in turn. The only general consideration is that all the Colonies, even the Somalis. would wish to have their sovereigntyrecognised in theory even if they exercised no administrative powers in practice.Principal Alternative Solution in Relation to each Colony.35. I shall now examine in respect of each of the Italian Colonies the various alternatives which have been put forward bearing in mind : (a) their practicability;(b) British interests;(c) international implications;(d) the wishes of the inhabitants;(e) His Majesty&apos;s Governments commitments.Libya.A. Collective Trusteeship.36. The factors which operate as regards Collective Trusteeship for Libyaas proposed by the United States Government are generally those which havebeen considered above (paragraphs 28-30). There are in addition certain aspectswhich are peculiar to Italian North Africa. The principal advantages of collective Trusteeship for this territory are : (a) that if the principle of eliminating Great Power politics is applied,Russia will be denied any large share in the control of the colony;(&amp;) that it does not close the door to any later settlement which may benecessary to provide for the interests of the Italian population andfor a later possible division of territory into administrative units which would after a number of years be capable of independentGovernment.37. In order to keep the door open to any later possible division of theterritory, it might be possible to have an international administrator at the headwith a deputy administrator for each territory beneath him who would beresponsible for the administration of Cyrenaica and Tripolitania separately,while their superior would control such departments as currency and commercein order to avoid any unnatural frontiers and difficulties of movement between these two Arab territories.38. The main objections to Collective Trusteeship for Libya as a wholelie in the fact that while it would deny Russia any considerable share in the
administration, it would also deny it to the British Commonwealth and mightrender impossible the acquisition of such strategic facilities as we may consideressential.B. Individual Trusteeship.39. Briish Trusteeship is open to the objections stated in para-oraphs 31-32. Russian Trusteeship us inadmissible. Neither the United Statesnor France would accept sole responsibility. There is, however, the possibilityof placing Cyrenaica under Egyptian or Arab League Trusteeship. Such asolution would facilitate the conclusion of a Treaty with Egypt in which wecould extend the military facilities that we require in that country to Cyrenaica.On the other hand Egyptian Trusteeship would be extremely unpopular with the.inhabitants and it is likely that the administrative ineptitude of the egyptian government would lead to conflict with the inhabitants similar to that whichharassed the Italians for many years.40. The Egyptians have shown themselves singularly incapable of administering any people outside their part of the Nile Valley. With theexception of a small group of Libyans who have been educated in Cairo, probably not exceeding a hundred in all, no one in Libya has suggested that they should come under Egyptian rule or trusteeship and the great majority treat suchsuggestions with derision. Moreover, Egyptian administration would only be practicable if it Avere supplemented by the employment of European and par-ticularly British officials and it is doubtful whether the Egyptians would accept this condition. It is probable that Egyptians who were sent to administerCyrenaica would consider their position either as exile or as a means of self-enrichment.41. The Arab League is incapable at present of bearing the burden of trusteeship. Either solution would probably therefore lead to unrest in the area,which would disturb the stability of the Middle East on which depends thesecurity of our position in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea.C. Restoration to Italy.42. Although the Italians withdrew all their residents from Cyrenaicaduring the North African campaign, there are still a considerable number in tripolitania (38,000) and these present a serious problem. The administration and economy of this western territory depends largely on the Italians and would suffer under Arab rule. Moreover, it would be invidious to place the Italiansat the mercy of a race that bear them only ill will, and their status would haveto be specially protected. There would seem, therefore, to be a strong case forsome special form of administration for the coastal belt of Tripolitania. Itmay, in fact, be a suitable area for Collective Trusteeship, whatever regime is established in the rest of Libya. The coastal belt might, in theory, be restored to Italy under trusteeship, but trusteeship implies eventual independence, andit is questionable whether this small area of mixed population, in which theItalians are in the minority, would be practicable as a self-governing unit.Tripolitania, moreover, is more advanced than Cyrenaica, and if Cyrenaicashould be given any form of autonomy or independence, as is discussed below,it would seem invidious to treat Tripolitania as a territory of lower develop-ment.43. Since in any event trusteeship over the Tripolitanian coastal belt wouldae of comparatively short duration, Italy would hardly gain any lasting benefit from it, and, indeed, any development of purely Italian interests would be contrary to the spirit of the Charter. In order to give to Italy an area foremigration and colonial development it would seem necessary to go further andrestore the coastal belt to her in full sovereignty. The outstanding objectionto this course lies in the fact that the Italians would be outnumbered by over15 to 1 by hostile Moslems who would constantly be spurred to revolt by theknowledge that their neighbours in the rest of Libya were enjoying at leastcomparative freedom.44. The Tripolitanians, moreover, make no distinctions between Fascist orDemocratic Italian Government, since the latter were responsible for the originalEvasion and campaign of conquest.  The segregation of the Tripolitanian coastal[31678]        &apos; &quot;   &apos; c
belt from the rest of Libya would cut off the Arabs who have already been exappro-appropriated by the colonists from the best part of the territory, as well as fromTripoli which has been their capital for many centuries.45. Moreover, to restore Italian control, including trusteeship by Italy,over any part of Libya would, greatly prejudice our relations with Egypt andthe Arab League and would provoke local protest and even revolt, and couldonly be prevented by use of force. As the present administering Power it would fall to us to provide this force, and it seems impossible for us to place ourselves in the position of having to re-establish Italian authority with British troops,(see paragraph 33).D. Independence of Union with Natural Motherland.46. A further possible alternative would be to attach Tripolitania toTunisia with which it has had long historical associations and close affinities.This could be achieved by uniting the two territories under trusteeship. Frenchacceptance of this plan would be conditional at least on France exercising trustee--ship. This in the first place would be open to the objections which have beendiscussed above, to trusteeship by any of the Four Major Powers. It would alsobe open to the objection that the Tripolitanians are hostile to the French andhave been further embittered by the knowledge that the latter are in occupationof the Fezzan and have territorial ambitions in this area, as well as in thefrontier areas. It is doubtful, moreover, whether France would accept trusteeshipover Tripolitania even if it were offered to her.47. An alternative which has been under discussion for some time is thatthe inhabitants of Libya should be enabled to choose their own form of govern-ment. There is little doubt that the Cyrenaicans and the tribal elements inFezzan and Tripolitania would opt for independence under Sayyid Idris andwould also almost certainly request British financial and technical assistance.The attitude of the Arabs in the Tripolitanian coastal belt is less certain. Ifthey considered that the choice was trusteeship or independence under SayyidIdris it is probable that they would prefer the second course.48. It is necessary to examine how far the Libyans are capable of self-government. There is a close analogy with the Iraq of a quarter of a centuryago. Like Libya to-day, Iraq was a backward Arab country that had just beenliberated from foreign rule by British arms and consequently found itself under british Military Administration. Iraq achieved full self-government intwelve years. During that period the Iraqi State contracted with the UnitedKingdom that there should be a measure of British control over Iraqi affairs in certain departments. Iraq, therefore, enjoyed virtual independence, subjectto certain limitations laid down in the Treaty of Alliance. The position was recognised in 1924 by the League of Nations. This resulted in a certain dualityin Iraq&apos;s status. On the one hand she was a non-self-governing State placed under British mandate by the League of Nations. On the other, she was a self-governing State which had unified limited sovereignty by a treaty with a mandatory Power. It is probable that Libya could reach the position of Iraqin 1932 in an even shorter period than twelve years. It is certainly doubtfulwhether Libya is ripe for complete independence at the moment, but in comparisonwith Iraq in 1920 Libya has comparatively few handicaps. There is no division,for instance, between the Sunnite and Shiite religious sects, nor is there aKurdish problem. In Sheikh Iclris al Senussi Libya has to-day one politicalasset of the utmost value which Iraq lacked in 1920. Whereas Iraq possessedno native dynasty, and King Faisal, Who was imported from outside had greatdifficulty in establishing himself, the Senussi Sayyids won their hold on the loyaltyof Libyan tribesmen long ago. Moreover, Sheikh Idris is a man of ability andthe Senussi succession is assured by certain near relatives who appear to be capable of following in his steps.49. Arabs who have not assimilated European political ideas conceive the ideal State to be a monarchy in which the monarch consults the Council of Sheikhs,notables and religious dignatories. His representatives would govern the tribesand administrative districts with assistance from the Advisory Councils. It hasalso been a normal Arab practice for the monarch to have European advisers andtechnical officials. The Libyans are certainly not different from other iirabs inthat they are capable of a form of self-government. Their religion and traditionsconvince them of this and Moslem law and their Arab customs provide the
machinery. There is thus already the necessary tribal organisation to administer the areas outside the towns. They are also capable of administering smallertowns, but they would need assistance in the administration of the cities, of whichthere are, in fact, only three (Benghazi, Tripoli, Misurata). Since the beginningof the war the Libyans have been trained in administration by the british military Authorities. In both Tripolitania and Cyrenaica the Arabs are takingan increasing share in the work of the administration and are occupying.positions of authority. There are, for instance, approximately 350 native officials in the districts and 100 in the towns of Benghazi, Derna and Barce, holdingresponsible positions, while a number of officials in out-stations carry considerableresponsibility with immediate British supervision. A capable police force hasbeen recruited which, except in one riot in Tripoli in November of last year, hasshown itself adequate to deal with any normal trouble that might arise. It seems,therefore, that Libya is ready for a more advanced form of administration thanthe United States plan envisages.50. On the other hand, there is no one in Libya capable of dealing withoutforeign assistance with the more general affairs of State, particularly foreignaffairs, drafting of legislation, the higher branches of the judicial system, generalaspects of finance and economics, and medicine, agriculture, public works, posts and telegraphs, &amp;c. Libya, moreover, cannot raise sufficient revenue to support a reasonable administration for some years to come.51.   Libyan self-government is a possibility provided -(a) there is continuity of British guidance at the top throughout the periodof transition from the present Military Administration to a futureindependent State;(b) the new State is given a subsidy sufficient to prevent its lapse into adiscreditable primitive condition until such time as it can balanceits budget.52. If some form of independence is to be introduced, it would be desirableto consult the inhabitants on the choice of their titular head. If the matter were put to the vote, the method which is requested by the Libyans themselves, themajority of Tripolitanians as well as Cyrenaicans, would vote for Sheikh Idris,because&apos;it is the only means they can see of avoiding a return to Italian rule ortrusteeship, a Russian trusteeship, or the Collective Trusteeship proposed by theUnited States. To all three solutions they are strongly opposed. Moreover, ifLibya were divided it would be difficult to establish a satisfactory frontier since it would have to pass through a nomadic area. There is, moreover, little prospectof establishing a satisfactory independent State in Tripolitania within a numberof years. Division would also lead to unhealthy rivalry between the two territories in attempts to obtain subsidies and assistance.53. It would seem therefore advisable that, unless more important factors,decree that either territory should be disposed of separately, Libya should be-treated as a unit. This applies to whatever regime is introduced in Libya, forthe desire of the inhabitants not to be divided is manifest, and they have strongcommon bonds.   Moreover, the Arab League is strongly opposed to any division.54. Although the position of Sheikh Idris as head of the State wouldprobably be recognised without great difficulty, the Tripolitanians would resent any direct control by the Senussi and a degree of autonomy would be essential.Thus Sheikh Idris could exercise direct rule over the tribal elements of Cyrenaicaand Fezzan through the existing tribal system. In the towns of Cyrenaica his powers would pass through the Arab councils instituted by the British military administration, while in the towns of Tripolitania there would have to be aremote control, and probably a special status for the Italian and Jewish colonies.55. The degrees of independence which might be established are asfollows : (a) Full independence as a sovereign State under Sheikh Idris a countryready for membership of the United Nations. Since Libya is still lessadvanced than Iraq in 1932, it will be desirable that the UnitedKingdom should accept the offer of a treaty which would certainly be forthcoming from Sheikh Idris, by which in return for financial andtechnical assistance he would grant strategic facilities. Its statuswould be analogous with that of Iraq during the period 1920-22,except that Libya would not be placed under trusteeship (mandate).T31678] &apos;   c 2
(b) It might also be possible to consider Libya as a territory analogous to the class A mandates of the League of Nations, or, as the Covenant stated,&quot;of a stage of development where its existence as an independentnation can be provisionally recognised, subject to the rendering of administrative advice and assistance by a mandatory until such time as it is able to stand alone.&quot; This form of independence comes closer to the American plan. It appears that the State Department envisageLibya being placed under some system similar to the class A mandates,with the mandatory powers being exercised by the Trusteeship Counciland a certain degree of autonomy being granted to the Senussi.56. This scheme (&amp;), like that of collective trusteeship, is open to the objection that we might not be able to obtain any strategic facilities that we might require.Italian Somaliland.57.   The objections to any proposal, such as the United States plan, tocontinue to treat Italian Somaliland as a unit are examined more fully in. Annex A.   There seems to me to be only one satisfactory solution to the Somaliquestion and that is the unification of all the Somali tribes under one adminis-tration.58. The attitude of the Somali inhabitants to such unification is not articu-late but it is probable that, provided Jigjiga is included in the proposal (it isnow in the Reserved Area), the tribesmen of that area would welcome inclusion in any administration which took them out of Ethiopian control. As the record of British rule in British Somaliland is not an altogether happy one, it is unlikelythat the British Somalis would deplore our departure, though they might regardsurrender of their status of British-protected persons as being a retrograde step.The Somalis of Kenya, should it be decided to include the areas which theyinhabit in a unified Somali State, would be unwilling to be separated from theattractive green pastures of the Kenya highlands. On the whole, however, the somalis, while probably preferring continuation of the British Administration,would not object to an international one provided Italy was excluded.59. Since the Somalis are a primitive people who will not be ripe for independence for some considerable time, whatever form of administration isset up must have an element of permanence. At the same time it need not be an elaborate system of government since military administration of the territoriesduring recent years has proved that the best method is to interfere little in the life of the inhabitants. The principal requirements of this area are external financial support for economic development, and whoever exercises trusteeshipwill be carrying substantial financial burden.A. Collective Tritsteeship.60. The general considerations on Collective Trusteeship above (paras. 28-30)are pertinent since the administration would have to continue for a long period. This course appears to be the most promising way of achieving a united Somalia.B. Individual Trusteeship.61.   Trusteeship by any member of the British Commonwealth or by theUnited States would be open to the objections which have been discussed above(paras. 31-32).   It is, moreover, most unlikely that the United States would assume this responsibility.C. Restoration to Italy.62. The restoration of Italian rule, besides running counter to the deepfeelings of the Somali inhabitants, might also lead to the situation which arose in 1935 when Italy showed that her development of Italian Somaliland was devoted primarily to fulfilment of her imperialist designs on Ethiopia. In viewof Italy&apos;s fickleness as an Ally we might find a hostile Power occupying territoryadjoining any future strategic reserve which we might build up in Kenya andbecoming embroiled with us over the Suez Canal and1 Red Sea route.
D. Independence or Union with Motherland.83. The possibility of making the Somali territories, or any one of them,independent must, for a number of years, be ruled out-as impossible.64. Another solution is presented by the claim which the Emperor of ethiopia has made to Italian Somaliland. This is objectionable on a numberof grounds. It would be most unpopular with the Moslem inhabitants and itwould condemn them to indefinite backwardness and probably oppression andmisrule. The only basis for this claim is Ethiopians need for an outlet to thesea, and this- can be met much more satisfactorily in Eritrea.65. In any decision on the future of the Somali territories we must bearin mind our commitment to the British tribes, and it will be imperative, if adecision is taken to transfer them from British protection to any other form ofadministration, to consult them on their future.66. It may be desirable to maintain certain British strategic facilities in this area, and if Collective Trusteeship should be introduced in a unifiedSomalia we might be able to secure these by agreement with the United nations in return for our magnanimous offer to part with British territory. If, on theother hand, it is not necessary to secure these facilities it may be sufficient merely to ensure that the whole area is demilitarised.67. Another factor which may have to be taken into consideration in thefuture of the Somali territories, and particularly British Somaliland, is theprospect of striking oil. At the moment, however, it has&apos; no concrete significance.Prospecting in British Somaliland has established that the colony has oilreserves of some importance, but for about five years it will probably be impossibleto determine their capacity. At the moment it appears that this capacity willbe approximately equivalent to that of Egypt. It is doubtful whether it is of sufficient importance to modify the suggestion that the future of the Somaliterritories lies best in their unification. It is probable, moreover, that in returnfor our gesture of renouncing our protection over British Somaliland, we couldsafeguard any British oil concessions or prospecting rights in this area.Eritrea.68. The American proposals would place Eritrea under Collective Trustee-ship for a number of years and thus retain the present frontiers under oneadministration. As Eritrea had never existed as a political entity until theItalians created it at the end of the last century, and it is ethnically disunitedand economically non-viable, there is no good reason for preserving it as an administrative unit under any form of administration, whether under IndividualTrusteeship or restored Italian rule. The right solution would seem to be todismember it along its natural lines of cleavage. Since there is no prospect,or indeed desirability, of a recreated Kingdom of Tigrai, the best course mightbe to meet the wishes of the Christian Unionists of Eritrea who desire incorpora-tion in Ethiopia. This transfer would give Ethiopia the highlands in the centre of the Colony. Although the Danakil inhabitants of the southern coastal areas are neither Christian nor sympathetic to Ethiopia, it is difficult to see whatalternative there is to the course of giving them also to Ethiopia which wouldunite them with a large number of Danakils in the Aussa province. They arehardly numerous enough to be considered as a possible future independent entityand therefore are not a suitable subject for trusteeship. To: incorporate boththe Coptic Christian highlands of Tigrinyan Eritrea and the Danakil lowlandsto the south would give Ethiopia access to the Red Sea and at least one portin Assab.69. There are, however, alternatives to Ethiopian annexation of the districtaround Massawa which is mainly inhabited by Moslems. It is probable thatthe Emperor, in claiming a port on the Red Sea before he expanded his claimto cover the whole of Eritrea, liad Massawa rather than Assab in mind. Itis very doubtful whether his acceptance of the United Somalia plan would begranted unless he was given at least Massawa in addition to the Christian andDanakil areas mentioned above. It has also been proposed that Massawa shouldbe a United Nations security base operated either by the United Nations as a wholethrough the Security Council or by the United States (paragraph 16). Theobjections to the former are probably that this would give Russia a direct interestand control at an essential point in the Red Sea.   It is questionable whether the
Americans would wish to establish themselves in Massawa though it may well bedesirable to associate them in this line of communication. If it is consideredthat the British Commonwealth require exclusive strategic facilities in Massawa,it is possible that the agreement which we shall have to negotiate with theEmperor over the whole question of Eritrea and the Somalilancls might include an undertaking by us to support his claim to the port provided he offered ussuch facilities there as we might require. It is. however, doubtful whether wecan achieve the United Somalia project unless we offer the Emperor sufficientinducement to part with the Ogaden and Reserved Area. It may therefore even be necessary to be in a position to offer him the whole of Eritrea without anylimitations on his sovereignty, including the Moslem areas in the North and north West.70.   There are two principal alternatives for these North-Western areas :-(i) incorporation in Ethiopia, which would run counter to the wishes of theinhabitants. It would also probably burden the Government of theSudan with an extremely troublesome frontier dividing the SudaneseBeni Amer from the Eritrean Beni Amer with consequent borderdisturbances;(ii) transference of these North-Western, areas to the Sudan to which theynaturally belong.The main objection to this second course is that it lays the British Common-wealth open once more to the charge of painting more red on the map and if we feel it necessary to call on the other Big Rowers to renounce their claims to the italian colonies, ,we shall have to make a similar renunciation ourselves and apply it toany government in which we play a major part.71. Eritrea is in many ways at a higher stage of development than Ethiopia.Its inhabitants are on the whole more progressive and Italy achieved there a great measure of economic development. In order to prevent Eritrea relapsing it mightbe better to award it to the Emperor with the stipulation that he must give certainguarantees to the United Nations. On the other hand, to insist on suchreservations might make it impossible to conclude an agreement -with theEmperor which would satisfy our requirements in the Somali territories.Conclusion.72. I have an open mind as to the best course. I am, however, satisfiedthat we can hammer out a Commonwealth policy which we can all advance withoutfear. Although the problem is very difficult, there are four encouraging factorsof fundamental importance. In the first place, we are occupying the territories under discussion and no settlement can be arrived at, to which we object.Secondly, our administration is popular in all the territories, and the views and needs of the inhabitants coincide very closely with our own. Indeed, they would almost certainly accept any settlement which we proposed, provided it was basedon the principles underlying this paper. Thirdly, we have the goodwill of theUnited States, although this would almost certainly not extend to any purely british settlement. Finally, the interests of the Arab League and our ownare very close, and a solution acceptable to the League would immeasurablystrengthen our position in the Middle East.E. B.Foreign Office, S.W. 1,18th April, .1946.
ANNEX A.Background.1. The former Italian Colonies have few features in common. The two principle ones are their poverty and the attitude of the inhabitants to their former rulers. In spite of an energetic colonial policy, it was only possible for theItalians to run their colonies at an economic loss. Their colonies indeed weredeveloped not so much for economic reasons as for strategic. Although theinhabitants of each of the territories are dissimilar and in Eritrea far fromhomogeneous, they all nevertheless share hostility to Italian rule, which variesfrom bitter hatred to intense reluctance to be restored to it. t2. There are certain features in each territory which deserve separate consideration.Libya.3. The Italian possessions in North Africa, collectively termed &quot;Libya,&quot;-comprise three principal separate regions which are separated from each other byinhospitable and thinly populated desert, namely Cyrenaica, Triolitania andFezzan. In the first two of these are relatively small areas of cultivable land onthe Mediterranean coast and in the third a group of oases deep in the hinterland.Historically Tripolitania has been associated with Tunisia, and Cyrenaica with egypt. Of the present population of just over one million, the vast majority areArab or arabicised Berbers. The total Italian and Jewish populations of Libyaare 38,000 and 31,000 respectively. The Italians are confined exclusively, and Jews mostly, to Tripolitania, and the greater part of the Moslem population issettled in the cultivable areas on the coast and in the oases. The whole territoryis poor in economic resources, depending almost entirety on agriculture andfisheries. Its small population and scanty resources would condemn it to increasing poverty and backwardness unless its needs were met by outside support.4. More than half of the thirty years of Italian occupation were spent inbitter warfare against the tribesmen and particularly against the Senussi, andthis has intensified the hatred of the inhabitants for their former rulers. Thei entire Moslem population is strongly opposed to a restoration of Italian rule in.any form, but there is, however, a divergence of views on the form of governmentwhich the inhabitants would prefer. The Moslems of Cyrenaica are weldedtogether in allegiance to the Senussi religious fraternity, which is the only existingnative political force in Libya. What Sayyid Muhammad Idris and his Senussifollowers are aiming at in Libya has actually been achieved in Arabia byIbn Saud and his Wahhabi followers. The strength of the Senussi movement wasillustrated by the tenacity of its resistance to Italian conquest between 1911 and1931 in Cyrenaica and Fezzan in contrast to the disunity displayed by the lessprimitive agricultural and urban population of Tripolitania.5. Sheikh Idris not only commands the allegiance of the vast majority ofthe Moslem population of Cyrenaica and Fezzan but also of a number of tribesin Tripolitania. Certain Tripolitanian leaders have invited him to become rulerof all Libya, but it appears that they favour this solution not so much for itself as one preferable to other threatened alternatives which, in the eyes of theTripolitanians, would seem incompatible with native self-government, forexample, the possibility that France may retain possession of Fezzan which sheis at present administering.6. The Cyrenaicans appear to be solidly and consistently in favour of independence under the rule of Sheikh Idris with British support. In this they see eye to eye with the sheikh himself whose desire for British support is explicitand emphatic. In Tripolitania, apart from the movement which invited SheikhIdris to become ruler, there are two principal currents. One runs in favour ofBritish trusteeship, or perhaps of Tripolitanian independence fortified by british political, financial and technical assistance; the other is openly hostile to theSenussi and favours trusteeship by Egypt or the Arab League. This is, however,confined to Libyans resident in Egypt&apos;and to Egyptians of Libyan extraction.Italian Somaliland.7. The future of Italian Somaliland (1,200,000 inhabitants of whom 5,000are Italian) cannot be satisfactorily considered separately from the future ofthe whole Somali area &quot; the Horn of Africa.&quot;   This area, comprising all that
lies east of a rough line drawn irom the southern end of the Red Sea to the mouth of the Juba River, is inhabited by the single race of nomadic people, the Somalis.who speak dialects of a common language, have the same customs, religion and form of tribal organisation and are at approximately the same stage of economicand cultural development. This territory is at present divided between italian somaliland, Ethiopia and British Somaliland. The landward frontier of thelatter separates the inhabitants from the grazing areas essential to their livelihood.These grazing areas are contained in the Ogaden and Reserved Area which fill the angle between British and Italian Somaliland, and which, until 1935, formed part of Ethiopia. Most of the frontier between the latter and Italian Somalilandhas never been demarcated. Since the defeat of the Italians in East Africa in1941 all four of the above areas have been under British military administration.The inclusion of the Ogaden and the Reserved Area was negotiated in the Anglo-Egyptian Agreement of 1944, which terminates in March 1947.8. The great majority of the inhabitants of French Somaliland are not.in fact, Somalis and economically this colony is connected with Jibuti and notwith the Somali territories described above.9. There is a clear case for the rationalisation of existing political frontiersand for the union of all these Somali-inhabited territories (/.*?., British andItalian Somaliland, Ogaden and Reserved Area) into one country under oneadministration.   In this alone lies the area&apos;s only hope of progress.10. The whole area is extremely poor and both British and italian somaliland have only been administered at a loss. By unifying the whole areait may be possible, in a number of years, to reach a position where a modestadministration can just pay its way, though external assistance would be neededat the outset.11. The views of the Somali inhabitants have taken no positive direction.The inhabitants of the Ogaden would resist by force any attempt to restorethem to Ethiopian control, and there would be similar bitter opposition fromthe Italian Somalis if Italian rule were restored.12. All the facts mentioned above argue strongly in favour of the unification of these three territories. The inclusion of the Ogaden and the Reserved area is essential since without it the frontiers of the United Somalia would be longand unmanageable and communications would be most difficult. Moreover, theBritish tribes would remain deprived of their essential grazing grounds andthe difficulties of administration would remain unsolved. It is, however, only possible to create a United Somalia with the assent of the Emperor of Ethiopia,and in considering the whole problem of the Italian East African colonies the position of Ethiopia is fundamental.Eritrea.13. The problem of Eritrea presents three principal similarities to thatof the Somali territories. In the first place it is closely connected with the positionof Ethiopia and, in the second, the political frontiers of Eritrea run counter to history, geography, economics, religion, race and language. There is as cleara case for the rationalisation of the political geography of this territory as thereis for the Somalilands. Thirdly, both the Somali territories and Eritrea havenever been in a position to meet their expenses from local revenues and havedepended on outside assistance.14. The present population of Eritrea is about 800,000, of which 37,000are Italians (confined almost entirely to the Asmara district). The natives fall into three main divisions : Tigrinyans, Beni Amer and Danakils.15. The Ethiopian province of Tigrai, which was the nucleus of the ancientKingdom of Ethiopia and, until the usurpation of the Shoan dynasty, provided the rulers of that Empire, is divided in two by the 1935 Eritrean-Ethiopianfrontier. There are thus 3,000 or 4,000 Tigrinya-speaking people inthe mountains of Eritrea who are closely akin to the ruling class of Ethiopia.The frontier between the Sudan and Eritrea divides the nomad Beni Amer into two sections, although their affinity is such that the chiefs of each part are drawn from the same family. The Danakils are divided between the Red Seaplains of Eritrea, French Somaliland and the Ethiopian hinterland. The pre-eminence of the Sultan of Aussa in Ethiopia is recognised by the Danakils in
all of the three territories. The Tigrinyans are Coptic Christians, and the*BeniAmers and the Danakils are Moslem. There are thus three main divisions ofEritrea, two Moslem sections separated by a Christian.16. Although the inhabitants of Eritrea are politically backward andinarticulate compared with the population of Italian North Africa, they haveexpressed their wishes in simple and clear terms. The Moslems, whatever their district, class, occupation or political development, are united in objecting toCoptic Christian rule whether it should be exercised by the Christian Eritreans,a reconstituted Kingdom of Tigrai or by the Emperor of Ethiopia. The Moslemsof the North, including the districts of Keren, Agordat, Massawa and the Dahlakislands have through their chiefs petitioned for independence under united nations trusteeship exercised by the United Kingdom for from ten to fifteen years, in view of the knowledge and understanding of Eritrea&apos;s problems thatBritish administration has acquired during its existence. The Moslems of thisnorthern area would presumably be satisfied by incorporation in the Sudan since these territories lie close to and have close affinity with the tribes west of the sudanese frontier. The Danakils of Eritrea join to some extent in the wish for united Kingdom trusteeship and in opposition to Christian rule, although theyhave shown no objection to union in Ethiopia with their Aussa brethren.17. The Tigrinyans in the central Eritrean mountains are divided into&quot;separatists&quot; and &quot;unionists.&quot; The present relative strengths of these twoChristian parties are not easy to estimate. The Separatists join with theEritrean Moslems in reluctance to come under the Shoan dynasty of Ethiopia,though they have a traditional yearning for union with their Tigrinian neigh-bours in Ethiopia within a restored Kingdom of Tigrai. The Unionists, centredprincipally in Asmara, support incorporation in Ethiopia.ANNEX B.Italian Colonies.Notes on I, Finance; II, Population.I. Finance.There are no figures available showing the revenue and expenditure of eachcolony separately under Italian Government. Total expenditure on all thecolonies together amounted to 7,356,959,000 lire ( 118,660,629 at 62 lire to  ) forthe financial year 1939-40. The figures for 1943-45 are taken from the Reportof the Military Administration of the Italian Colonies from 1944 to the PresentTime (War Office, March 1946). The Budget represented by these figures is, ofcourse, on the care and maintenance basis on which the colonies are being administered under British Military Government. Import and export figuresfor 1934 are available for Tripolitania, Cyrenaica and Eritrea, and for 1936 forSomalia.(1) Tripolitania.&apos;&apos;ImportsExportsAdverse BalanceRevenueExpenditureDeficit1934.Lire.161,943,00030,089,000131,854,000:  2,126,693 at62 lire to  .1st July, 1943-30th Jiine, 1944. 2,075,000239,0001,836,0002,350,4372,726,915376,4781st July, 1944-31st March, 1945. 1,480,0001,076,000T31678&quot;404,0002,512,1432,655,949143,806
