THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government memorandum prepared in the Cabinet Offices.1.   It is submitted that further instructions are required from the Cabineton the policy to be adopted towards proposals for the publication by persons&quot;who have held office as Ministers of the Crown of information regarding Cabinetproceedings or based on Cabinet documents.2. During the years immediately following the 1914-18 &quot;war, a largenumber of books were published, chiefly autobiographical in character, dealingwith the events of the war and, in particular, with the part played by the variousWar Leaders. Many of these books contained references to proceedings in theWar Cabinet or at Ministerial meetings, to the views of individual ministers and to the advice given to them by high officials, as well as quotations from orsummaries of Cabinet memoranda and other similar documents. If material of this kind was to be used, the established procedure was for application to bemade to the Cabinet Office for permission; the Cabinet Office would consult theDepartment concerned with the subject matter, and if neither Department sawobjection to publication, would submit the matter to the Prime Minister of theday, who would, if he thought fit, consult the Prime Minister in office at the timecovered by the material in question and, where necessary, seek The King&apos;consent. While this procedure was followed by some authors, others publishedbooks containing such material without any official permission at all. Neglectof the approved procedure was facilitated by the fact that many former Ministers,and high officials had retained in their possession documents circulated to themin their official capacity.3. In 1934 and 1935 it began to be felt that the time had come to institute a stricter control over the retention of Cabinet documents by persons no longer in official positions, and to impose more rigid restrictions on the use of such material in published works. This was reflected in the decisions of theCabinet (a) that all Cabinet documents circulated to Ministers should be returnedby them on vacating office to the Secretary of the Cabinet (Cab. 11(34)7);(b) that access to Cabinet documents should not be granted to non-officialpersons for the purpose of producing ordinary, non-official historical,biographical or other similar works except where it could be shownthat publication was desirable in order to vindicate the memory of adeceased person who had been injured by similar publication in thepast.   (Cab. 35 (34) 4.)4. As a result of the first of these decisions, the great majority of formerMinisters returned to the Cabinet Office such documents as they had retained;,and, in the administration of the second decision, the Cabinet Office were ableto secure the exclusion from published works to much greater extent than previously of references to proceedings in Cabinet and other matters of the kind.There thus grew up in practice a distinction between the policy adopted towards;information relating to the period of the Avar and that relating to the post-war period. This distinction was formalised in a decision taken by the Prime minister in June 1938 that information relating to the period from the beginning of thewar to the 1st November, 1919,* should be treated on a different and more lenientbasis than information relating to the period after that date.5. We are now once more in a post-war period, and there are already signs that a considerable number of memoirs and similar works are in preparation,many of which will no doubt contain information of the kind under discussion in this memorandum. It will be recalled that under a decision of Mr. Churchill(W.P. (45) 320), Ministers vacating office in 1945 were permitted to retain copiesof the Cabinet documents which they themselves wrote; a number of Ministersavailed themselves of this right. Quite apart from this, it seems inevitable that,whatever rule is adopted, many books will be published, without permission,containing information of this kind. If former experience is any guide, recourse to proceedings under the Official Secrets Act will rarely be judged appropriate in such cases; and similar concessions will eventually have to be given as a matterof fairness to those who seek permission.  A new and important element in the* This period was extended for documents relating to the Pence Treaties to 24th July, 1928.7317811
situation is the fact that much confidential discussion, of the kind covered by cabinet documents, took place during this war with United States representa-tives, and much information of this kind is therefore in the possession of american citizens, over whom the United States Government have not even such control as is conferred here by the Official Secrets Act.6. It is therefore submitted that it will not be practicable to adhere inregard to the war period to the policy of stringent restriction laid down in 1934,since an attempt to do so would speedily be brought into contempt; a new policy must be formulated, which on the one hand does not interfere with the reasonable and proper purposes for which such books are written, and on the other handwill not involve publication of any material which would be seriously detrimental to the public interest.7. On the first point, such books are usually written by former ministers to explain and justify the policy of the writer during his official life. This policymay have been the subject of public comment and its full defence may requirereference to matters which at the time had to be regarded as secret. This suggests.two general considerations :  (a) A Minister of the Crown, who is responsible to Parliament and whoseofficial actions are properly subject to public comment and criticism,stands in a different position in regard to writings of the kind referredto, from Crown Servants generally, who have not a Minister&apos;sresponsibilities.(b) To the extent that questions (e.g., of defence) have to be treated at thetime they arise with exceptional secrecy there is a case for permittinga. correspondingly greater measure of relaxation with regard to them,when the considerations (e.g., of military security) which formerly-kept them secret no longer apply.8. The concern of the Government, on the other hand, is primarily with theeffect of disclosures on future administration. Here the essential point is tokeep secret information of two kinds, disclosure of which would be detrimental to the public interest: (a) In the international sphere, information whose disclosure would beinjurious to us in our relations with other nations, includinginformation which would be of value to a potential enemy.(b) In the domestic sphere, information the publication of which would bedestructive of the confidential relationships on which our system ofgovernment is based and which may subsist between Minister and minister, Ministers and their advisers, and between either and outside bodies or private persons.9. The points set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 should, it is suggested, formthe guiding principles by reference to which decisions would be reached as towhat material may properly be included by Ministers in published writings from information obtained by them by virtue of their office. The adoption of these principles will result in a certain relaxation as regards the use which may be madeof information derived from Cabinet documents and Cabinet proceedings, subject always to the very important limitation imposed by paragraph 8 (&amp;) above, which means that reticence must be observed as to the views advanced by individual ministers or their advisers.10. Some definition of the war period will be necessary. For the terminal-date the end of the war with Japan can perhaps be taken. But the opening dateean hardly be the 3rd September, 1939, and it is submitted that whatever policyis adopted as regards the war years themselves will have to be taken as applying to the central themes of defence policy in the years immediately preceding the war.11. There is the further point that the publication in ewtenso of official documents otherwise than by the Stationery Office should only be allowed in very exceptional cases; and then only when the document is in some sense personal tothe writer.12. This memorandum is drafted in terms relating to the writings of formerMinisters, and information about Cabinet proceedings or from Cabinet documents.This is because it is in that aspect that the problem arises for the Cabinet Office,who are responsible for the security of Cabinet records and to whom formerMinisters naturally apply.  The policy suggested has, however, been considered in
the wider context of what may be published by former Crown Servants generally and if the principles set out in the memorandum are approved by Ministers, apolicy consistent with it can be formulated for the wider sphere.13.   To sum up, the following proposals are submitted for consideration : -(a) The points set out in paragraphs 7 and 8 should be taken as the guidingprinciples in determining what use can properly be made by former &apos;Ministers in published writings of information obtained by them by. virtue of their office.(b) Publication of official documents in eaitenso, otherwise than by the stationery Office, should only be allowed exceptionally.(c) The  relaxations  proposed  should  apply to  the  War period  (the3rd September, 1939, to VJ-day) and should be taken as covering alsothe central themes of defence policy in the years immediately preceding the War.(d) All former Ministers should be informed of the above and of the recognised procedure as summarised at X in paragraph 2.(e) The application of the above to former Crown Servants will be further considered and a submission made to the Cabinet.3rd May, 1946.
