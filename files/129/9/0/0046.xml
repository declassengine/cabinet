(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S E C R E T COPY NO.   v.?S&apos;CP.   (46)  19617TH MAY,   1946^CABINETCESSION OP SARAWAKMemorandum &quot;by tho Seeretary of State for the colonies my colleagues will remember that the Cabinet at  their meeting on the 13th May,  (C.M.(45) 45th Conclusions, Minute 6)after hearing from me the substance of a report by the two members of Parliament  (Colonel Rees-Williams and Captain Gammans)who were&quot; visiting Sarawak,  agreed that I should informRajah Brooke that the cession of his territory would be acceptable to His Majesty&apos;s Government if the State Councilsdecided in favour of that course.2. It may be convenient if I summarise the comprehensivereport made by the Members of Parliament in which they expressedthe view that opinion in the territory on the question ofcession fell Into three groups. -   First and preponderate opinion among Malays and Dyaks was that whilst in themselves seeing no advantage in cession for its own sake they are prepared to trustthe Rajah&apos;s  judgment that it is the best thing for the country.Second opinion held by the majority of young Malays  in Sibu, -Chinese and educated Dyaks,,  the last of whom are chiefly inKuching and Sibu, was that they believe in cession for its ownsake;    Chinese because they consider it will bring greatercommercial prosperity to the country    educated Malays andDyaks because they are dissatisfied with present standard ofeducation and progress generally.      The third opinion comprisingMalays and Dyaks in small up country-stations and Malay NationalUnion led by Datu Patinggi in Kuching,  favoured continuance ofBrooke rule under, the Rajah,  Tuan Muda or Anthony.      TheMembers of Parliament went on to express the view that therewas sufficient acquiescence or favourable opinion in thecountry to  justify the matter going before the Council Negriand they strongly urged that there should be no postponement.3. The Council Negri (Legislative Council) of Sarawak,at a meeting on the 16th May, passed the Cession Bill byeighteen votes to sixteen on its second reading.      The votirgof the non-European members was twelve for and fourteen againstthe Bill which was thus carried by the votes of.the european members.      The Tuan Muda (the Rajah&apos;s brother), who opposescession,  though not a member of tho Council, was allowed tobe present and to speak, but the Rajah did not himself attend.The&quot; third reading of the Bill on the 17th May was passed bynineteen votes to sixteen.      The two Members of.Parliamentreported that the proceedings on second reading were badlyconducted but,  telegraphing after the debate on the 17th May,they said:-&quot;Third reading today more businesslike.      Speechestranslated.    Voting 19 for,  16 against.      In our view this represents a fair view of Council as constituted.      Leavingby Pickle today for Singapore.&quot;

4,        It will be seen that the Members of Parliament&apos;have not suggested any suspension of the next stage of action which, asthey are aware,  is the seeking by the Rajah of the authorityof his Supreme Council to sign the Instrument of Cession.Nevertheless,  in view of the narrowness of the majority andthe fact that the Bill was carried by European votes, I feltthat I ought to consider whether it would be necessary to review the Cabinet decision of    the 13th May to the extent ofgiving an opportunity for the matter to be debated inParliament &quot;before the Instrument of Cession is signed.That would have entailed a change of procedure in that theRajah would not now have sought final authority from hisSupreme Council to sign the Instrument of Cession but wouldhave asked for authority to do so at some later date.5. As against any criticism that this important measurehas only been passed in consequence of European votes andthat there was in fact a small majority among the non-european members against it,  it can be argued that the Council asconstituted contains European Members, who voted as  individuals and not as an official block,  and that if we disregard the votes of those Members, we shall in fact be ignoring thedecision of the Council as constituted.      As stated above, thetwo Members of Parliament in their original report said thatthere was sufficient acquiescence or favourable opinion inthe country to  justify the matter going before the Council.Their further message, quoted above,  states that the-Votingrepresents a fair view of the Council as constituted. .    Itcan therefore be argued that having sounded opinion throughoutthe country the Members of Parliament were content to leavethe matter to the Council,  as constituted,  and that they couldnot therefore question the Council&apos;s decision.      A furtherimportant point is that the Tuan Muda, who,  as stated above,attended, and spoke in the Council on the 16th May,  had undertaken to accept the decision of that body.6. After careful reflection on all these considerations,I consulted the Prime Minister and the Lord Privy Seal whoagreed with my view that in all the circumstances there wasno need to go back on the communication made to the Rajah inconsequence of the Cabinet decision on the ISth May.Accordingly the Acting British Representative in Sarawak hasbeen informed that,  subject to the Supreme Council at its meeting on the 20th May authorising the Rajah to cede theterritory,  he may sign the Instrument of Cession on behalfof His Majesty&apos;s Government.G, H. H.Colonial Office.,Downing Street, S.W. 1.17TH MAY,   1946.
