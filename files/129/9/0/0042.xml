Note by the Additional Secretary.BY direction of the Prime Minister I circulate for information the annexedReport by General Robertson on the food situation in the British Zone ofGermany.(Signed)      NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Qth May, 1946.269SECRET. Copy No.  3CP. (46) 192.9th May, 1946.CABINET.ANNEX.Appreciation of the Effects of a Further Reduction or Cessation of Importsof Food Grains into the British Zone of Germany.I. The Present Situation.1. When we instituted the 1,000-calorie ration at the beginning of March,we appreciated that the German people had certain reserves of food and bodilystrength and that the effects of that reduction would not be felt to their full extent for a period. We estimated that period at two months, and therefore itis now that we should expect to see these effects revealing themselves.2. There has been some deterioration of the physical condition of the peopleparticularly in the bigger towns. A Tripartite Nutrition Commission is startinginvestigations in the three Western Zones now. Their Report on the british zone will be available at the end of May. We shall then have a better picture of the point to which this physical deterioration has taken place. There hasbeen a loss of energy and a diminution of output in a number of industries.Absenteeism has increased. There has been an increase in Black Market activities,though we have succeeded in preventing large-scale Black Market operations by stern measures. A certain amount of looting of food stocks has taken place;the most serious aspect of this is the looting and digging up of seed potatoes.Farmers are also selling seed potatoes to be eaten. It has been estimated thatthe quantity of seed potatoes already lost through these causes represents areduction of 2,000,000 tons of potatoes from the crop. If this estimate is correct,it means that an additional 400,000 tons of food grains will have to be importednext year in compensation.3. It is not possible for an adult human being to subsist on 1,000 calories. Ifproof of this were needed we have it from our prisons and internment oamps. Theinmates of these places have been receiving 1,200 calories and in spite of this havebeen starving, so that it has been found essential to increase their rations. There-fore the Germans have been drawing heavily on the reserves to which reference is made above. They have no means of replenishing their reserves. Gardenproduce will not be available in appreciable quantities for another two months,and in any case is not a substitute for bread.   There must come a point when[31805]
these reserves will be exhausted. In our opinion that point is not far off. Itmay be reached very soon and it may happen very suddenly. The deduction fromthis is that even if the present ration were maintained widespread starvationis not far ahead. Any review of the effects of further reduction in rations should start from this understanding.II. The Food Situation if Imports are reduced.4. If no more imports for the British Zone arrive before the next harvestis available, other than those at present en route, the distribution of bread andcereal products will cease at the end of the present ration period, i.e., the27th May. There will be breakdowns in distribution locally before that date.We shall then have no residual stocks of imported food grains and there are no appreciable stocks left in the farms. This would mean that the Germans would receive only those other products which are available, such as meat, fats, fish and sugar. These are available in sufficient quantities to provide an average rationfor all non-farm consumers of about 450 calories. Such a calorific value is quite inadequate to maintain life. There are about 19-J million non-farm consumersin the British Zone.5. Displaced Persons receive their bread ration from the stocks suppliedfor &quot;the German people. They would suffer severe hardship unless bread for them were supplied from other sources.6. If it is really the case that food imports are to cease, it would be advisable to take steps immediately, while there is still some food available, to ensure thatbare essential services can be maintained for a while. We should not be ableto distribute any ration at all when the railways can no longer run. The main-tenance of certain services, of power, telephones, transport, water, &amp;o, is essential in the interests of the Forces of Occupation (including the Control Commission).If such services were not maintained, administration would degenerate into chaos.We should have no means of preserving administrative order except such as theuse of force provides. It would, therefore, be wise to cancel the present ration of bread and cereal products now and to distribute the remaining stocks in sucha manner as to ensure the maintenance of these essential services. We shouldalso stop immediately the export of coal.7. If food imports were reduced to one half of our requirements on theexisting ration scale, issues of bread and cereal products would have to be reducedby one half. This statement is not completely accurate but can be accepted for practical purposes. This would in theory provide a ration for the normalconsumer of about 750 calories, assuming that the bread rations of all classesof consumers were halved.8. In practice it would be impossible to distribute supplies evenly. It wouldalso become essential to revise the classification of consumers, reducing priorityclasses to a bare minimum. This would provide slightly more food to the normalconsumer. It would not prevent his starvation, but it would mean that the processof starvation would be more gradual.III. Economic Repercussions.9. Quite clearly, if food imports stop, the economic life of the British Zonewill stop almost simultaneously. Coal production will stop. The trains willstop. The lights will go out. Only by taking in advance the measures mentionedin paragraph 6 above for creating a small reserve would it be possible to keepgoing minimum essential services.10. If imports were cut to one half of our requirements, it would not bepossible to maintain large-scale coal production. All exports of coal would haveto stop immediately. We could only attempt to maintain a sufficient production to keep going the minimum essential services required for the Forces of Occupa-tion and to preserve administrative order.11. In Industry and in Transport a similar situation would, arise, that isto say, it would with difficulty be possible to ensure the maintenance of theminimum services necessary for our administration, for food processing and forthe distribution of such food as is available.  &apos;12. It being impossible to keep the economic life of the country in motion,the only sensible course would be to make certain that industrial plants and essential installations of all natures should not suffer deterioration.   Mines not
being worked must be kept free from water; certain plants must be kept running at a low rate. In fact, it would be necessary to turn the economy of the british zone over to a care and maintenance basis.IV. Political Repercussions.13. Until the recent food cuts, the British were looked upon by the Germansas the least objectionable among the four Occupying Powers. They had acertain respect for our administration, for the behaviour of our troops and forthe justice of our methods. Our control and administration were more far-reaching and severe than those of the other Powers, but this was accepted bythe Germans because they were reasonably efficient and fair. This situation has already changed considerably, and it will be reversed by further reductions in the ration. The Germans will know that their fellow-countrymen in theAmerican and Russian Zones will be much better off. Starvation will make us the most hated of the Occupying Powers, and it is hatred which will endure.Our far-reaching control will prevent us from throwing the blame on the Germanadministration as the Russians did last autumn. The mass of the Germanpeople will argue that, if, after a year of the democratic experiment and british administration, starvation is the result, they will be well advised to reject bothdemocracy and the Western way of life.14. It is already noticeable that the present food situation is benefitingtwo parties the Nazis and the Communists. Whispering campaigns by Nazisympathisers spread the story that our action is deliberate and that Britishprotestations about democracy are hypocrisy. The Communists concentrate oncomparing life in the British Zone with conditions in the Soviet Zone and, byclever propaganda, create the impression that the food crisis is due to Britishmaladministration and British unwillingness to trust the people to organisefood distribution. If there are any further cuts, even those German democratsupon whom we rely for the future in the political parties and in the Germanadministration will lose heart. Social democracy, which is identified in Germaneyes with the form of government in Great Britain, will be gravely weakenedand the working classes will look to communism and Soviet Russia as their onlysaviour.15. If rations are further cut it will not be possible to hold elections both for political and administrative reasons.16. Our plans for transferring administration to the Germans themselveswill be frustrated. German administrators must be fed or they cannot function.They are too numerous to be given priority consideration. We shall be forcedback to the conditions of June 1945 when we administered our zone directly, butwe have not now got the means for doing it.17. Political effects outside Germany are scarcely within the scope of this paper. It may, however, be worth mentioning the effect of la cessation of coal exports, particularly in view of the approach of the French elections.18. Dismantling and packing plants for Reparations would have to stop.This would have political repercussions with the Russians.19. The sporadic looting and unrest, which is occurring now, would increase.It is not, however, likely that the situation would get out of hand, provided thatour own soldiers will be prepared to shoot down starving rioters.V. Conclusion.20.   The conclusions of this paper are summarised as follows : &apos;If food imports cease, all economic activity in the British Zone will come toa stop. The Germans in the zone will starve rapidly, apart from the farmpopulation.If food imports are reduced to one-half of our requirements, the economic life of our zone must be put on a care and maintenance basis. Only those services could be maintained which are essential to do this and to maintain the Forces ofOccupation.   The Germans in our zone would starve, but more gradually.5th May, 1946.
