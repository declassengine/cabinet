jHIB DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1946.Slir.T. Copy No.CP. (46) 166.UthApril, 1946.CABINET.EXPENSES OF MEMBERS OF LOCAL AUTHORITIES.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.IT is the official policy of the Labour Party, adopted at the Party Conferenceof 1932, that members of any local authority should be entitled to allowances fortravelling, subsistence and loss of remunerative time in attending meetings ofthe authority. The allowances then proposed were set out in Appendix X ofthe Report of the Conference. Briefly, these contemplated a personal allowance of 3s. \d. for a meeting involving absence from home of four hours, 65. Sd. foreight hours and  1 for each night necessarily spent away from home. For lossof remunerative time, the maximum allowances proposed were 7s. 6d. for a half-day and 15s. for a full day. Provision was also made for cash allowances for a woman who has to find a substitute for domestic work or the care of children.It was contemplated that the cost of these allowances should be shared equally between the Exchequer and local rates.2. The Local Government Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party havenow passed a resolution calling on the Government to introduce early legislation to give effect to the recommendations adopted by the Party Conference in 1932.They ask, however, that the amounts then proposed should be revised to take account of the subsequent increase in the cost of living.This resolution was submitted to me. I have replied that, in view of the congestion of Parliamentary business, there can be no question of immediate legislation on this subject; but that I am having the question carefully examined.3. The existing law on this subject is summarised in the Annex to thisinemorandum.It is, I understand, the view of the Minister of Health that on meritgislation ought to be introduced to rationalise the existing provisions for the[31690]
payment of travelling expenses and subsistence allowances. The Minister con-siders that these should be payable in respect of attendance at meetings of rural district Councils as well as County Councils; but that in County BoroughsBoroughs or Urban District Councils they should be payable, not for attendance at meetings, but only in respect of journeys outside the area of the local authority which are made on the business of the authority. The Minister considers, how-ever, that allowances for loss of remunerative time should be payable (at the rateof 10s. for a half-clay and 20s. for a full day) to members of all local authorities,both for attendance at meetings and for journeys made on the business of theauthority.4. The Minister of Health has suggested to me that the Cabinet mightproceed at once to a decision to introduce legislation to carry out the changes which he recommends. These differ, however, in certain respects from theproposals which were adopted by the Party Conference in 1932 and are nowsupported by the Local Government Group of the Parliamentary Labour Party.At this stage I do not ask the Cabinet to weigh the relative merits of the two schemes. I do, however, invite them to consider whether this is a matter onwhich we can proceed at once to formulate legislation, on the basis of theinformation already available to us; or whether it would be preferable, before reaching a final decision, to have a preliminary enquiry made into the whole matter &quot;by an independent Committee composed of persons outside theGovernment.The case for holding such a preliminary enquiry is that any comprehensive scheme for the payment of these expenses is likely to arouse keen controversy-inwhich the division of opinion may not fall wholly along Party lines. It will nodoubt be contended that such a scheme would cause a fundamental change in thecharacter of Local Government and in the attitude towards voluntary publicservice. The holding of a preliminary enquiry by an independent Committeewould strengthen the Governments hand in dealing with this issue. The enquiryheed not involve delay; for legislation could not in any event be introduced until next Session and there is no reason why the Committee should not report within six months.5. A related point of greater urgency is whether payment for loss of renumerative time should be made to members of the new bodies which are to beset up under the National Health Service. This must be decided before theNational Health Service (Scotland) Bill is introduced in November -and indeed,if similar provision is to be made in England and Wales, before the completionof the Committee Stage of the English Bill. This question is, however, separablefrom the general issue of allowances to members of local authorities. There are numerous precedents for paying allowances for loss of remunerative time to members of statutory tribunals appointed, as the new Health Service bodies willbe, by the Government e.g., tribunals and courts of referees appointed by theMinister of Labour and the Minister of Pensions.On this point, therefore, I propose that a Committee of officials should beappointed, under Treasury chairmanship, to consider whether a decision to make
navment to the members of these new bodies for loss of remunerative time wouldl in accordance with the statutory precedents already established in this field,and whether such a decision should be applied in Scotland alone or throughout great Britain. This Committee could make their report within a matter of weeks; and, when we have it, we shall be in a better position to see whether adecision on this limited issue is likely to have repercussions on the wider issue oflocal councillors&apos; expenses by reason of the fact that some members of the new(Health Service bodies will be local authority representatives.Summary.6.   I therefore invite the Cabinet (a) To consider whether, before introducing a comprehensive scheme for thepayment of allowances for attendance at meetings of local authorities,we should arrange for a preliminary enquiry to be made by anindependent Committee.(b) To approve my proposal that a Committee of officials should at once beappointed, under Treasury Chairmanship, to consider the more limitedquestion of payment of loss of remunerative time to members of thenew bodies to be established under the National Health Service.C. R. A.10, downing  Street, S.W.1,24:th April, 1946.ANNEX.Existing Law on the Payment to Members of Local Authorities of travelling Expenses, Subsistence Allowances and Allowances for loss of Remunerative Time.County Councils in England and Wales may pay to their members travelling expenses but not subsistence allowances (i.e., allowances for personal expenses)in respect of attendance at meetings of the Councils or their Committees.County Councils in Scotland may pay to their members travelling expenses,subsistence allowances (at the rate of 3/Ad. for four hours&apos; absence from home,6/8(2. for eight hours&apos; absence from home and  1 for 24 hours&apos; absence or a night
away from home) and allowances for time necessarily lost from ordinary employ Iment in attending meetings of the county councils or of any of its committees o&quot; 1sub-committees (at the rate of 7/66?. for each half-day and 15/- for each full &apos;day lost). iCounty Borough, Borough, Urban District or Rural District Councils in iEngland and Wales and Town and District Councils in Scotland cannot nay itravelling expenses or subsistence allowances to their members in respect of Iattendance at meetings of the Council or its Committees. A U Councils may pay  rreasonable travelling expenses and subsistence allowance to members travellingon the authorised business of the Council outside the Council area. 0Thus, except County Councils in Scotland, no Councils may pay allowances to members for loss of remunerative time either in respect of attendance at meetings of the Council and its Committees, or in travelling on the business of theCouncil.
