THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENT    3&quot; OftPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1946.124SECRET. Copy No. 3 8CP. (46) 171.25th April, 1946.CABINET.REPORT OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON MEMBERS&apos; EXPENSES.Memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE Cabinet, at their meeting on the 1st April (CM. (46) 29th Conclusions,Minute 7) (1) agreed to accept the substance of the recommendations made in theReport of the Select Committee on Members&apos; Expenses, subject tocertain reservations made in my Memorandum, CP. (46) 123;(2) appointed a Committee consisting of myself, the Home Secretary andthe Chief Whip to consider, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion,in what form the substance of these proposals could best be presented to Parliament and the public.2. Since the meeting of the Cabinet, we understand that opinion in theHouse of Commons has moved against acceptance of the Select Committee&apos;recommendation that all Members should be allowed an expense allowance of 500 free of income tax.3. My colleagues and I have reached the conclusion that the best wayof handling the matter would be for the Government to put forward the simpleproposition that the salary of a Member of Parliament should be raised from 600 to  1,000 a year; and that no change should be made in the procedure inregard to claiming, within that salary, relief from income tax in respect ofParliamentary expenses. The effect of this would be that the Member would,as heretofore, have to substantiate his claim if his expenses exceed  100.4. If the Cabinet accept this recommendation regarding the salaries and expenses of private Members, it will not be possible to accept the Select Oom-mittee&apos;s proposal that Ministers with salaries of less than  5,000 a year (andthe Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Chairman) should be granted an expense allowance at the rate of  500 a year free of tax. We propose instead thatthese Ministers (and the Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Chairman)should receive, in addition to their salaries as Ministers, one-half of the salarypaid to private Members of Parliament, that is  500 a year, and should be entitled,like other Members of Parliament, to claim relief from income tax in respect oftheir expenses as Members of Parliament up to that amount.5. We recommend that the Leader of the Opposition, and a Member of Par-liament in receipt of a pension as an ex-Prime Minister, should be treated in thesame way as Ministers with salaries of less than  5,000 a year, i.e., they shouldreceive a salary of  500 a year as Member of Parliament in addition to the salaryor pension provided in the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, and should also beentitled to claim relief from income tax up to  500.6. We recommend that His Majesty&apos;s Government should take no initiativewhatsoever in regard to any suggestion that Ministers in receipt of salaries of 5,000 per annum should be accorded the same treatment as Ministers withsalaries of less than that amount. If this should be proposed it should be left to a free vote of the House.7.   In discussion in the Cabinet the view was expressed that it would bedesirable, when amending the Ministers of the Crown Act, 1937, to deal also[31685]
with certain anomalies in regard to the salaries of Ministers below  5,000 a year.We have considered this point and suggest that the salaries of the Minister ofPensions and of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should be raised from 2,000 to  3,000 a year and that the salary of the Assistant Postmaster-Generaland Parliamentary Secretary of the Minister of Pensions should be raised from 1,200 to  1,500 a year. (The salary of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasteris paid out of the revenues of the Duchy. It is necessary to decide whetherthe proposed addition should be paid from the same source or from moneys provided by Parliament.)8. As to recommendation (e) in the Select Committee&apos;s Report, we recom-mend that season tickets should be issued while Parliament is in session; but that members should use their book of vouchers for journeys between their homes andWestminster on Parliamentary business during the recess. This can be done by administrative means.9. We recommend that these changes should take effect from the 1st April,1946.10. A draft announcement to give effect to these recommendations isattached.H. D.,On behalf of the Committee.Treasury Chambers, S.W. 1,25th April, 1946.Draft Announcement.THE Government have considered the recommendations of the SelectCommittee on Members&apos; Expenses as set out in paragraph 13 of its Report.(a) They propose that every Member of Parliament, other than a minister or Junior Minister, or an Officer of the House, should in future be entitledto a salary of  1,000 a year in lieu of the present salary of  600 a year;but that no change should be made in the present procedure for claiming relief from income tax in respect of expenses.(&amp;) They propose that a Member of Parliament in receipt of salary as a minister (if less than  5,000 per annum), or as Chairman or Deputy Chairmanof Ways and Means, or as Leader of the Opposition, or in receipt of pension asex-Prime Minister, should be entitled, in addition to such salary or pension, toa salary of  500 a year as a Member of Parliament; and should be entitled to claim relief from income tax in respect of expenses as a Member of Parliamentwithin the limit of  500.(c) They propose that the salary of the Minister of Pensions and of theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should be raised from  2,000 to  3,000a year, and that the salary of the Assistant Postmaster-General and of theParliamentary Secretary of the Ministry of Pensions should be raised from 1,200 to  1,500 a year.(e) They propose that railway season tickets should be made available to members for daily journeys from their homes to Westminster during theParliamentary Session.(d) and (/). They will consider further, in consultation with the authorities of the House of Commons, the subsistence arrangements for Members travelling&apos;on the business of the House and the machinery for settling disputes regardingMembers&apos; subsistence and travel arrangements.They propose that these changes shall take effect from the 1st April, 1946.They intend to move the necessary Resolutions and introduce the necessary legislation as soon as possible to give effect to these proposals.
