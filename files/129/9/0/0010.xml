As I think you know, we have arranged a programme of interviewscovering the lst-15th April. The representatives include the Premiers andLeaders of Oppositions from all Provinces, and also representatives of theprincipal political parties. By giving an additional two or three days to theseinterviews, and by allowing some of the minor parties to come and be heard by Cripps and Alexander only, we have managed to meet all claims to be heardwhich have any reasonable substance. This is a lengthy process, but I think itis proving of value even though all we are doing at this stage is to hear thestatement of existing views.3. This week our interviews have included Gandhi, Maulana Azad, Jinnah,and the Sikhs, and also a meeting with a deputation of the Chamber of Princes.4. There is, I am afraid, no sign of any accommodation at present as betweenthe Congress and the Muslim League. The Congress are, however, prepared toconsider the widest provincial autonomy. Their proposal is that there shouldbe a minimum list of compulsory federal subjects which might be foreign affairs,defence, communications and probably customs. There would then also be anoptional list of federal subjects which in practice only the Hindu provinces wouldbe likely to adopt, but they appear to set great store on immediately setting up an Interim Government which will be responsible for bringing into being a constitution-making body charged with making a constitution on these broad principles. Their proposal is that this Interim Government should be formed byinviting the eleven Provincial Governments to nominate one person each. Thesenominees need not be drawn from the Province itself, or be members of legisla-tures. In reply to a question, Azad said that he thought that if it were desired,more than one nominee could be put forward by each Province, and that hepersonally would not be opposed to a panel of nominees being put forward. the minorities would be represented by selection to the extent of three seats in atotal of fifteen.[31665]
5. I put it to Azad that, in view of the results of the elections, the muslim league would under this procedure not have more than two or possibly threerepresentatives in a Council of fifteen. Azad seemed to admit the force of this and thought, speaking personally, that arrangements may be made whereby fourMuslim League representatives would be included. He said definitely that congress would not under the present constitution agree to parity with the muslim League. Cripps asked Azad whether, in view of the fact that the HinduProvinces only would in fact take optional federal subjects, the Congress would agree to a separate list of optional subjects for the Muslim Provinces whichwould enable them to come into closer co-operation among themselves for subjectswithin the special list. At first Azad seemed wholly opposed to this idea butsubsequently said that it was a matter which might be considered.6. Jinnah, on the other hand, in a three-hour interview insisted thateastern and western Pakistan must be sovereign States and that there could beno relations between those States and Hindustan except by way of treaty or agreement. Anything else would be a surrender of sovereignty. On the questionof areas, he made it clear that he was willing that substantial Hindu areas in bengal and the Punjab should go into Hindustan, but he insisted that limitationof Pakistan to the areas in which Muslims constitute 50 per cent, or more wouldbe quite unacceptable since such a Pakistan would not be economically viable.In particular, he said that Calcutta must be in Pakistan. We put to him thepossibility that Calcutta might be a free port and, while he did not reject thispositively, he raised objections to it. Jinnah made a fairly good case for Pakistanon cultural and religious grounds, but he was completely unyielding and showedno signs of any intention of making a proposition to meet the Congress. We wentfor him on the question of defence and, although Cripps made a strong attemptto pin him clown as to what he contemplated should be the subject matter of atreaty between Hindustan and Pakistan, we got very little out of him.7. The Sikhs were, of course, opposed both to Hindustan and Pakistan.They wanted a united India but in the event of a divided India a separateautonomous State for the Sikhs. They based their case for that on the high proportion of land revenue paid by the Sikhs in a substantial area of the Punjabeven though nowhere are they in a majority of the population.8. We also had a satisfactory meeting with the Chancellor of the Chamberof Princes and four other members of the Standing Committee of the Chamber.I gave them full replies to a series of questions they had put me and, in thecourse of doing so, I made it clear that Paramountcy was coming to an endwhen a fully self-governing constitution came into operation in British India.I also made it clear that in those circumstances we should not be able to providetroops for the internal protection of the States and that therefore the states on their part would be liberated from their obligations under the treaties.They took this quite well. I was a good deal impressed with Bhopal, and Ithink he may be a helpful factor, though there is no sign of the States showingany desire to take an initiative which might ease the British Indian situation.9. You will see from this that so far as interviews go we are getting on,but from the point of view of reaching any solution we have not really yetgot started. In addition to the official interviews we have had a number ofprivate talks including Gandhi, Jinnah, Vallabhai Patel, Nehru and many others,but these have only served to dot the &quot; i&apos;s &quot; and cross the &quot; t&apos;s &quot; of the officialdiscussions. Gandhi is, at the moment, inclined to be generally helpful, but Inever feel sure what line he may adopt. The Indian Press has ceased to be actively hostile.10. We shall probably be seeing the main parties again in about 8 or 9 daystime, and may lay before them some suggestions for agreement, but I thinkthat the critical phase will come in the week after Easter, and we may thenformulate some definite course of action, and lay it before you.11. We have decided definitely not to go to Simla though we may go awayfor the Easter week-end to Kashmir.12. From telegrams I have received I am afraid Burma is giving youanxiety especially on the question of the possible arrest of Aung San on a murdercharge. My personal feeling is that if we start probing into what happenedduring the Japanese occupation we shall stir up mud which may well give usa lot of timxble.
