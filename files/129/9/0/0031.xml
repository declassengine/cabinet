THIS DOCUtoJNT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1946.CONFIDENTIAL.CP. (46) 181.30th April, 1946.CABINET.OLYMPIC GAMES.Memorandum by the Secretary for Overseas Trade.1 welcome the Foreign Secretary&apos;s announcement (in CP. (46) 141) of theproposal that the next series of Olympic Games meetings should be held in thiscountry in 1948, and I support His suggestion that the responsibility for organising the Games should again be left in the hands of the British Olympic Association.2. In paragraph 3 of the paper, however, the Foreign Secretary proposestlhe appointment of an Inter-Departmental Committee composed of representativesof the various Departments which can assist in seeing that the Games are turned to good account in the development of our tourist trade. This suggestion doesnot, I think, take sufficiently into account the Government-sponsored machineryalready in existence or under contemplation for dealing with tourism.3. I understand that tlhe Treasury have now considered the Catering WagesCommission^ report and have put forward proposals covering departmental responsibility for both catering and tourist services. The proposals are nowbeing discussed by officials; and, whichever form of executive machinery is finally agreed upon, provision will be made for all the inter-departmental consultation and co-ordination necessary for the development of tourist trade:4. Meanwhile we are proposing to the Treasury at the Official level theimmediate establishment of an inter-departmental group of officials who willtake in hand at once the urgent job of re-equipping sufficient hotels, &amp;e, to providefor a tourist trade in 1947. We feel that we cannot postpone this short-termjob while we wait for the establishment of new and more comprehensive machineryfor doing the long-term job.5. The Travel Association is now under vigorous leader ship, and we have secured an increased grant from the Treasury with a most encouraging letterfrom the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which will permit the Travel association to get increasing grants from the Treasury pan passu witH its ability to raisefunds from tlhe industry. The Association contains on its Managing andGoverning bodies a full representation of the catering, tourist and entertainmentinterests.. Moreover the Export Promotion Department of the Board of Trade hasrecently created a small but active Reception and Tours Section which keeps inclose touch with the Travel Association in facilitating visits to this country notonly of business men but, in certain special cases, of tourists.6. I should therefore regret the establishment of another inter-depart-mental committee to deal with the particular problems of tourism arising out ofthe Olympic Games meeting. By the time preparations for that meeting arestarted, the Government-sponsored machinery for dealing with tourism shouldbe working smoothly enough to provide for the necessary liaison with the BritishOlympic. Association.[317441Copy No.i
If any problems should arise in the meantime, the Committee on external economic Policy (of which I am the Chairman) might as an interim measureco-ordinate the work of departments on this subject at the ministerial level.7. I fully agree with the suggestion that the Games should, if possible, beheld in June rather than in July or August.H. A. M.Board of Trade, S.W. 1.,30th A pril, 1946.
