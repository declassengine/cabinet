REDUCTION OF WHEAT CONSUMPTION IN THEUNITED kingdom memorandum, by the Minister of food on the 10th April, Mr. Hutton the U.K. representative on the Combined Food Board was authorised to state that HisMajesty&apos;s Government were willing to ration bread in theUnited Kingdom if the United States were prepared to  adoptthe same policy.      Short of this His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwere prepared  to adopt administrative measures of a compara-bly effective nature  to those which the United States wereprepared to adopt designed to save wheat and flour.2.      A reply has been received to this proposal fromMr.  Clinton Anderson, United States Secretary of Agriculture,stating that the United States Government does not desire to ration bread, but that they do desire to reduce the consump-tion of flour.      The alternative measures which the UnitedStates Covernnent have announced for reducing flour consump--tion and making increased quantities of wheat and othergrains available for export are;-(a) Reduction of the production of wheat flour bymillers for use in the United States to 75% ofthe amount distributed in the correspondingmonths of 1945.(b) Limitation of the use of wheat by food manufacturers to 75fo of  the amount they used in the samemonths of 1945.(c) Acquisition by U.S. Government of all stocks ofwheat in the hands of millers and- food manu-facturers in excess of an amount necessary for21 days supplies.(d) The payment of a bonus of 30 cents a bushel on wheat delivered by farmers before 25th May.(e) The payment of a bonus of 30 oents a bushel formaize supplied to the Department of Agriculture.(f) The purchase by the U.S. Government of anunlimited supply of oatmeal from oatmeal millersand the purchase of whole oats for reliefshipments.JHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HE  BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos; S GOVERNMENT)SECRETCP.

Total 160,000 tons*      It was recognised that any measures which the UnitedStates Government might introduce, whether4 the bread rationingor administrative action on the lines set out above, wouldtake some time to come into operation and would not makewheat immediately available for the countries in need of it,The U.S. Government,  therefore, appeaMto the United KingdomGovernment to divert cereals in stock in the United kingdom or being shipped to the United Kingdom from overseas,Mr.  Hutton was authorised to offer a diversion of 200,000tons during the months of April and May on the following conditions:-(i)    A formal undertaking by the President to repay not later than 31st July.(ii)    Repayment not  to be regarded as a reason for reducingthe United Kingdom allocation.(iii)    The U.S.  Government to give a formal pledge to underwrite any shortfall in Canadian exports tothe United Kingdom during June and July.In addition Mr. Hutton was to secure assurances that theUnited States would take effective steps to secure for exportwheat now held on farms, in traders hands or being fed tolivestock.      Possible measures were the taking over by theGovernment of all open contracts, requisitioning of all grainin the hands of traders, prohibiting farmers from retainingany millable wheat except for seed, and limitation ofmillers&apos;  stocks.4.      A letter has been received from Mr.  Clinton Andersonaccepting the  three conditions set out above, but making no reference to the assurances Mr. Mutton was directed to secureregarding the administrative action to be  taken to ensurethat maximum quantities of wheat were made available forexport.      The measures announced by Mr. Clinton Anderson, setcut in paragraph 2 above, go a considerable way in the direc-tion of ensuring that increased quantities of wheat and othergrains will be made available for export from the UnitedStates during the coming months&apos;.      Both the british ambassador and Mr 4 Hutton are satisfied that further pressure on the U.S. Government would secure no more stringentadministrative measures.      Indeed the Ambassador states thatin his view no more satisfactory reply to our proposal could resonably have been expected;5.      Mr.  Hutton has accordingly been instructed to announceto the Combined Pood Board that His Majesty&apos;s Government areprepared  to divert 2 00;000 tons of wheat or other cereals interms of wheat equivalent,  on the conditions set out in mr. Clinton Anderson&apos;s letter.6.     Discussions are taking place in Washington regarding thedestinations  to which this 200,000 tons is to be directed.The following plan has been proposed:-U.N.R.H.A.   countries 50,000 tonsSouth Africa - up to 10,000 tonsBritish Zone of Germany ,       50,000 tonsIndia 50,000 tons

For the balance of. 40,000 tons it had been suggested thatan additional 10,000 tons might be supplied to the british zone of Germany,  an additional 10,000 tons to India and anadditional 20,000 tons  to U.F.R.R.A.      In general theseproposals  are satisfactory.      They are, however, being examined by the Ministry of Food in case minor adjustmentsare necessary.7.      It is now necessary for His Majesty&apos;s Government todecide what &quot;administrative measures of a comparablyeffective nature&quot;  shall be introduced into the United kingdom to save wheat and flour in reply to the measures which havebeen introduced in the United States,(set out in paragraph above).    It is estimated that the 25% cut in flour consump-tion in.the United States will save 540,000 tons during thebalance of the first half of this year.      It has never been contemplated that the undertaking of His Majesty&apos;s Governmentmeant that we must make a saving of a similar amount.     Anysaving we make must be in the light of our own circumstances.8.      In my paper, CP.(46) 159 I drew attention to the worldwheat position and pointed out that the expected shortfall in supplies from Canada would, apart from any assurances v/ehave given to the United States Government, make it necessaryto curtail wheat and  flour consumption in the United Kingdom.I9,      I have now received an official estimate of Canadianshipments to the United Kingdom up to the end of September.I attach as an appendix to this memorandum a copy of theletter from the High Commissioner for Canada.10,      In accordance with Mr. Clinton Anderson&apos;s undertakingJuly shipments will be made up to the United Kingdom full requirements.      For August and September our minimum require- appointments of wheat from Canada for the U.K.  are 634^000 tons.Against this Canada is able tc supply 164,000 tons.    of this    I60,000 tons is required for other L.F.C. territories leaving    Ionly 104,000 tons for the U.K.      Unless, therefore canada is able to increase her September shipments (a possibilityhinted at in Mr. Massey&apos;s letter)  or unless the U.S.A.   isprepared  to underwrite the minimum U.K. requirements forAugust and September to the extent she has    done for Julythere will be a serious shortage of wheat in the U.K.  during   Ithe latter part of the third quarter of the year.11.      I feel, however,  that it would be unwise to make  toodrastic economies at this date.      we-must introduce reductions 1in consumption partly to implement our undertaking to theU.S.A.  and partly to safeguard our position in the thirdquarter.      But excessive economies will only&apos;bring increased   Idemands from the U.S..A.  for further diversions from the U.K.to other countries.      Moreover there is  the hope of  improved   IIsupplies from Canada during September.12.      We have already raised the extraction rate from 80$ to85fo,      We can take credit for  the saving of 25,000 tons amonth which this represents.      We can also  take credit for reducing our minimum stock level from 900,000 tons of wheat and 400,000 tons of flour to 775,000 tons of wheat and330,000 tons of flour.      I am ready to introduce the If lb,loaf, but have been, holding my hand as such a measure wouldbe unnecessary if bread rationing were introduced.    If theif lb. loaf were introduced it would save from 10,000 to15,000 tons of wheat a month,13,      In my paper C.P,(4fc) 159, I submitted for consideration Mof my colleagues certain other economies.    I am still examin- lling their necessity and the savings they would achieve.    i will make an oral statement at the meeting of the Cabinetstating which of these I consider immediately desirable.B.S.Ministry of Food, W.l&quot;.23RD APRIL,  1946.        -(,

APPENDIXCopy of a Letter&apos;from High Commissioner for canada dated 23rd April, 1946.My Dear Sir Ben,Following our conversation on the 17th instant I havenow received from my Government, by cable,  official detailedmonthly figures of Canadian wheat shipments to meet UnitedKingdom requirements.      For reasons you will appreciatethese figures are not firm commitments and it is desirablethat  this  should be clearly understood.My Government feels that in its enumeration of whatCanada can ship,   the monthly totals represent the bestestimates procurable and are neither very conservative norunduly optimistic, but are based solely on considered expertopinion as to producers&apos;  deliveries, upon which Canada mustrely for her export stocks.The estimated shipments are as follows -Long Tons463,000315,000315,000114,000114,00050,000   .1,371,000 tonsThese figures are inclusive of the London-Food CouncilAreas.      Both the United Kingdom and the London Food CouncilAreas were grouped, the reason being that after Aprilshipments, Canada will fall short of the stated minimumhome requirements of the United Kingdom,  viz. 317,000 tons per month, and Canada is  not in a position to determinepriority or the necessity of L.F.C, Areas at the expense ofUnited .. Kin gd om requirements.      If it is considered necessaryfor Canada to supply the L.F.G,  Areas, namely Malta 4,500tons and  the others 25,500 tons monthly, the 30,000 tons total must be deducted from the&apos;estimated combined shipments.The September  total of 50,000 tons represents FortChurchill stock only.      It may be possible to increase this with new crop wheat should any be available in time.You will not fail to note that these combined figures are more favourable in the July August position than thelast Canadian Wheat Board advice to your Ministry in early  -April.Yours sincerely,(Signed)    V. MASSEY.The Et.Hon. Sir Ben Smith, K.B.E., M.P.April (including March carry-over)MayJuneJulyAugus tSeptember
