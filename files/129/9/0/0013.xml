jHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1946.Copy No.CABINET.LEAKAGE OF INFORMATION.Memorandum by the Prime Minister.AT their meeting on the 4th April the Cabinet invited the Lord chancellor to enquire into apparent leakages of information regarding matters then underdiscussion by Ministers (CM. (46) 30th Conclusions, Minute 2).2. The Lord Chancellor has now reported to me the results of the enquiries which he has made. He is satisfied that it would not be profitable to pursue these enquiries further with a view to tracing the source of the leakage in these two cases.3. The Lord Chancellor has, however, suggested that standing arrange-ments should now be made by which each apparent leakage of information on matters which are under discussion by the Cabinet or its Committees would be examined by a single person who might, over a period, build up a cumulativepicture which might provide some clue to the problem of tracing the source ofthese leakages or might at least suggest some lines for future enquiry. It isnot contemplated that there should be a formal investigation on each occasion;but the available evidence in each case would be examined by the same eye, whichwould acquire special experience in looking for likely sources of leakage andmight in the end see something which could not have been observed by examiningeach case in isolation.4. I have approved this suggestion, and have invited the Lord chancellor to undertake the task of examining on my behalf all future cases of apparentleakage of official information regarding matters under discussion by the cabinet or its Committees.C. R. A.10, Downing Street, S.W. 1,29th April, 1946.SECRET.CP. (46) 163.mh April, 1946.[31720]
