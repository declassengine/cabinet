THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY*S GOVERNMENT-SECRET. Copy No.   3CP. (46) 190.7th May, 1946.CABINET.PUBLICATION OF THE SECRET REPORTS OF THE SELECTCOMMITTEE ON NATIONAL EXPENDITURE.Memorandum by the Lord President of the Council.AS my colleagues may have noticed, I was questioned on Business onThursday last, the 2nd May [Hansard, Columns 351-2), about the Motion in thename of Mr. Clement Davies and Mr. Stokes asking that all memoranda addressed by the Select Committee on National Expenditure in Sessions 19391-40 to 1941- 45inclusive, to the Prime Minister for consideration of the War Cabinet, be laid on the Table of the House of Commons. I explained that we had contemplated that the Leader of the Opposition should be consulted, and Mr. Churchill saidthat he had not the slightest objection to anything being published which theGovernment do not consider is detrimental to the interests or security of thenation. I replied that the Government would now consider the matter on its merits.2. When the Cabinet had before them on the 14th February my previous memorandum (CP. (46) 46) on this subject, they agreed to postpone their decision until after Mr. Churchill had returned to the United Kingdom (CM. (46)15th Conclusions, Minute 4). Taking into account in particular the view expressed at the Cabinet that early publication might have undesirable repercussions-sions in the United States on the forthcoming discussions of the Loan, I was proposing to wait before raising the matter again, but, as it has come up in theHouse, we ought now to reach a decision.3. I have carefully considered the arguments against publication whichwere advanced at the Cabinet, but on balance I remain in favour of publication,and I am reinforced in this view by the line taken by Mr. Churchill in the House,.I gather from Mr. Stokes that he is solely concerned with the Report on tank production, and does not intend to ask for the other secret Reports to bepublished. If there should be pressure for the publication of the other Reports,I should propose to resist it on the ground that the Tank Report is the onlyone in which *in view of the controversy about it there is sufficient publicinterest to justify publication. But I think that we should be prepared, ifnecessary, to agree to the publication of the other nine Reports, with the possible exception, as I suggested in paragraph 11 of CP. (46) 46, of the Report of the17th May, 1940, on Light Alloys. This exception would have to be justified onthe ground that in the view of the Government publication would be contraryto the national interest.4. As I stated in CP. (46) 46, the Coalition Governments reply, amount-ing in length to. about half the Report, would have to be published with theReport on Tank Production.5. I append a copy of a letter which the Minister of Town and country planning sent me after&quot; the previous Cabinet discussion. The Minister was amember of the Select Committee on National Expenditure practically throughoutits existence, and, as will be seen, he does not accept the argument that thereports were compiled and presented as secret reports and that publication wouldbe an abuse of confidence.[31797]Printed for the Cabinet.  May 1946.:    264
6.   I ask my colleagues (a) to authorise the publication of the Report on Tank Production of the9th March, 1944, together with the Coalition Government^ reply;and(&amp;) to leave it to me to decide in the light of any pressure from the House thequestion of publishing the other secret Reports, except the Report onLight Alloys of the 17th May, 1940.H. M.Office of the Lord President of the Council, S. W. 1.7th May, 1946..   ANNEX.Copy of a Letter dated 20th February, 1946, from the Minister of Town and country Planning to the Lord President of the Council.I see from paragraph 4 (pages 2, 3 and 4) of the Cabinet Minutes of the14th February last that consideration has been given to the question of publicationof the secret reports of the Select Committee on National Expenditure.I was a member of this Committee from its beginning practically to the end and from May 1941 onwards was Chairman of a Sub-Committee on war production, and I was in the Chair at a number of meetings when the Churchilltank was being inquired into. I feel that this experience may be of assistance tothe Cabinet and justifies my commenting on the validity of some of the arguments against publication set out in page 4.Paragraph (/) misconceives the position. The evidence upon which the secretreports were based was taken in exactly the same way as in the case of ordinaryreports. No assurances of secrecy were given beyond what was given to all otherwitnesses, viz., that their evidence would not be disclosed. This must have been so because investigations leading to reports always began on the assumption thatthe Committee would report to the House in the ordinary way. It was only whenthe report was approved that a decision would be taken as to whether the report should be published or because of its nature treated as a secret report. If theCommittee decided that the report should be published instead of kept secret the witnesses could have had no possible complaint.In no case was evidence published. This would have been a breach of the assurance given to all witnesses.  I am sure this should not be done.From what I have said it is clear that (g) is not accurate. The reports werenot produced specifically for consideration by the War Cabinet, though that mayhave been their ultimate purpose. But unlike the case of Cabinet papers theCommittee had to report to the House on every occasion when the power inquestion was exercised.My own view is that the Committee is answerable to the House and would on all occasions have reported to the House but for the need for security. Nowthis need has gone, there can no longer be any justification for withholding these reports from the House.(Signed) LEWIS SILKIN.
