(46) 194.10th May, 1946.CABINET.CALL-UP TO THE FORCES IN   THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.Memorandum by the Chairman of the Man-Power Committee.1. In the previous report of the Man-Power Committee on the subject ofthe arrangements for call-up to the Forces in the transitional period (CP. (46)&apos;121) three alternative schemes were put forward for consideration, and it was explained in paragraph 9 of that report that arrangements had been made forthe proposals to be considered by the Defence Committee before they came before the Cabinet. The Defence Committee, at their meeting on the15th April (D.O. (46) 12th Meeting, Minute 3), pointed out that application ofthe condition suggested in the case of men conscripted before the 1st January,1947 &apos;(*.e., that there should be an overriding limit of service corresponding tothe period fixed under the transitional scheme) resulted in a serious drop inthe strength of the Army in 1947. To avoid this, they invited the Man-power committee to consider a suggestion that men conscripted before the 1st January,.1947, should continue to be released in accordance with the age and length ofservice release scheme, without any overriding limit of service but subject to thecondition that all men conscripted before that date should be released before .men conscripted for a fixed period after that date.2. I attach a revised report which, for the convenience of my colleagues,embodies the original proposals and replaces the previous paper CP. (46) 121.3. I still feel that there are inherent difficulties in all three schemes and Ihave, therefore, considered, in consultation with the Minister of Labour and national Service, whether it is possible to overcome them by continuing the bestfeatures of each. On political, as well as industrial grounds it is desirable, ifpossible, that the fixed period of service which is to be introduced on the1st: January, 1947, should not exceed 2 years. Any longer period is likely to.meet with strong opposition, and might prejudice the acceptance of the principleof compulsory military service under a permanent scheme. The main difficultyof a 2-years&apos; period of service has been the serious reduction in the strengthof the Forces in the year 1947, due to the more rapid rate of release, in 1947,under Scheme C than under Scheme A, of conscripts serving at the 1st January,1947. This could be overcome by adopting the same rate of release in 1947 forthis class as under Scheme A. In the case of the Army this involves the acceptanceof a situation in which some men who had already served 2 years- on the1st January, 1947, would be retained until 1948. It is inevitable, however, bothunder war-time arrangements and under the transitional scheme, that men alreadyserving will have a longer period of service than men being called up, and thenecessity for this can be readily explained to men in the Forces.4.   Accordingly, I suggest a revised scheme, the main features of whichare :: (1) Everyone called up before the 1st January, 1947, will be releasedaccording to age and length of service.(2) Everyone called up before the 1st January, 1944, and still serving at theend of 1946 will be released before the end of 1947.   This means therelease by the end of 1947 of all men in release groups up to and including Group 57.[31812] b
(3) Everyone called up before the 1st January, 1947, will be released beforethe end of 1948. (Thus all men conscripted before the 1st January,1947, will be released before men conscripted for a fixed period after that date.)(4) Everyone called up during 1947 will serve a fixed period of 2 years.(5) Everyone called up during 1948 will serve a fixed period not exceeding2 years which will be progressively reduced to 1\ years by the end ofthe year.(6) Apprentices will be given the option to defer their military service as fromthe 1st January, 1948.5. The effect of this scheme, which will maintain in the most critical year of 1947 the maximum number of conscripts, is shown in the following table : Scheme D.(In thousands.)	-1946	1947.		1948.		1949.		end.

As stated in the revised Report, appended to this memorandum, the Man-Power Committee have been concerned only to show the possible effect of theproposals and the estimates given do not represent actual strengths, which willhave to be determined in the light of commitments and having regard to theprogress of the scheme of recruitment of regulars and short-term volunteers. Itis possible that the total strength of the Army may still fall below their require-ments and it may become necessary for the Defence Committee to consider afurther curtailment of commitments, or the transfer of certain commitments fromthe Army to the other Services.7. In view of the difficulties we have encountered in dealing with this problem and the necessity of coming to an early decision I hope my colleagues will feel able to accept the revised Scheme D which, after consideration, is I think thebest that can be devised.E. B.10th May, 1946.
APPENDIX.CALL-UP TO THE FOECES IN THE TRANSITIONAL PERIOD.Revised Report by the Man-Power Committee.(To replace CP. (46) 121.)1. The White Paper on Defence (Cmd. 6743) indicated that the government intended, as soon as possible, to announce that, from a given date, all new entrants to the Forces would be called up for a definite period and to say what that period should be.2. Date of introduction of neiv scheme. On general grounds it is desirablethat the system of a period of fixed service should be introduced at as early a date as possible. After the end of 1946 men will be conscripted at age 18, and, exceptfor a few cases of men who have been allowed to postpone their military service,older men will already have served or be serving. The 1st January, 1947, would,therefore, be an appropriate date on which to introduce the transitional schemeof fixed periods of service.3. Schemes for fixed period of service. Three schemes have: been pre-pared, based on this starting date. Under the first scheme (Scheme A) the fixed period starts at 3 years, and under the second and third schemes (Schemes Band C) at 2^ and 2 years respectively. Under all three schemes the period ofservice is subsequently reduced by stages to 1-J years. Under SchemesA and B this reduction begins at once. Under Scheme C men called up through-out 1947 would serve for two years and the reduced periods would begin in 1948..At Annex I is a statement showing how the period of service would drop under each scheme. Under all three schemes recruitment under current arrangements will continue until the end of 1946. ,,4. Basis of calculations. Tables illustrating the possible effect on thetotal strength of the Forces under each of the three schemes are set out in annex II.  The calculations are based on the following assumptions :- (a) That the build-up of regulars and short-service volunteers, which hasbeen estimated, by the Service Departments, will come up to the expectation shown in the first group of lines in each table. The figures shown are optimistic and on the basis of experience up to date, thenumbers recruited are likely to fall short of them. This does not affectthe immediate purpose which is to illustrate the application of theprinciples recommended. On the other hand, the rate of voluntary recruitment will obviously affect the rate of release in relation to approved strengths.(b) That the introduction of a fixed period of service for new entrants willmake it desirable to limit the period of service of men already servingon the date when the new period of service is introduced.   Thus ithas been assumed (i) that under Scheme A all conscripts serving at the 1st January,.. 1947, who had completed three years&apos; service by that date, willbe released during 1947; under Schemes B and C the limit wouldbe 2\ and 2 years respectively;(ii) that all men conscripted before the 1st January, 1947, will be released before men conscripted for a fixed period after thatdate; and(iii) that the, release of men conscripted before the 1st January,1947, will be according to age and length of service [seer   paragraph 5 below).(c) That the period Covered by the tables,i.e., up to 1951, will be a period during which abnormal commitments will persist. (They willprobably continue beyond 1951.) In particular, there will be, duringthis period, occupational forces in enemy territory. If this is so itwould be out of the question to reduce the period of service beloweighteen months. Regular strength will not have been completelybuilt up even by the end of this period, and if service were reducedto one year, none of the conscripts could be used abroad. The service ministers consider that it will be hard enough to manage on a periodof 1-g years&apos; service.[31812] b 2
(d) That, although the estimates are for men only, at the end of 1946 41,000women will remain in the Auxiliary Services making a total of1,200,000 men and women in accordance with the Defence white paper. No decision has, however, yet been reached with regard tothe future of the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services. If it is decided tomaintain the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services oh a voluntary basis as apermanent feature some reduction in the numbers of men might bemade. The recruitment of women for the Auxiliary Services wouldnot necessarily mean an equal reduction in numbers in civilianemployment as some women would be recruited from unoccupiedclasses.5. Treatment of men already serving at the 1st January, 1947. With regardto the. proposal-of the Defence Committee that there should be no overridinglimit of service for men conscripted before the 1st January, 1947, corresponding to the period fixed under the transitional scheme, it is desirable, on grounds of equity and in the interests of the morale of the Services that, as far as possible,all men who have already served for longer than the period fixed for new entrantsat the 1st January, 1947, should be released during 1947. This principle can,however, be expressed as an aim to be reached in regulating the release programme and need not be regarded as a fixed rule. This will enable releases to be regulatedaccording to total requirements and to the rate of voluntary recruitment. For thepurposes of comparison between the three schemes the figures in the second group of lines (conscripts entering before the 1st January, 1947) in each table in annex II are based on the application of the principle.6. Position of older men.- Consideration has been given to the positionof older men under these proposals. During 1946 a few men will be conscriptedOver the age of 25 as they become available on release from industry. It is there-fore reasonable that, so long as these older men are conscripted, allowance shouldhe made for age as well as length of service. As regards men already serving,an examination of their distribution in release groups shows that all men overthe age of 35 at the date of their call-up will be released this year in all three services. Indeed, in the case of the Royal Navy and the R.A.F., all men whowere over the age of 30 at the date of their call-up will be released. In the caseof the Army, some men who were aged 31 to 35 at the date of their call-up arelikely to be still serving; their period of service will vary from 1J to 2^ years. Itis probable, however, that even in the case of the Army all men who were overthe age of 30 at the date of their call-up will be released by mid-1947, and thatat mid-1947 men with the longest service still retained in the Army will be thosewho were called up at age 18 in July or August 1943. The position of older menis, therefore, adequately safeguarded by continuing release on the basis of theexisting age and length of service scheme for men conscripted before the1st January, 1947.7. Effect on strengths. It will be seen from the tables at Annex II that under all three schemes there will be a reduction in the strength of the Army in1947, at a time when its occupational commitments will still be heavy. Thus, inthe first half of 1947 the strength of the Army will fall by 85,000 under Scheme A,by 115,000 under Scheme B, and by 149,000 under Scheme C. These figures arethe result of assuming an even rate of release throughout 1947 of conscriptsserving at the beginning of the year. As pointed out in paragraph 5 this rate of release could be varied in accordance with requirements.8.- The drop in the strength of the Army referred to above has a direct&quot;bearing on the question of deferment and postponement of service for young men.As indicated, the estimates of the regular build-up are optimistic and they are not likely to be exceeded, however vigorous the recruiting campaign and the attractive-ness of the inducements offered to the short-service volunteer. It will be essential,therefore, to maintain the conscript intake at as high a level as possible.9.   Call-up of apprentices. The detailed arrangements as regards deferment,on which the estimates of conscript intake are based are as follows :-(a) deferment on the existing bases of men in coalmining and agriculture;(b) discontinuance of deferments in other industries, except building and building materials;(c) continued call-up of most Arts students until September 1948;
(d) call-up of all apprentices until the end of 1947, except those deferred as above on industrial grounds. (The calculations are, however based onthe assumption that from the 1st January, 1948, apprentices would beallowed to postpone their military service.)10. The most important of these provisions from the point of view of boththe strengths of the Forces and industry is (d), and Annex III shows the effect onthe conscript intake of deferring the call-up of apprentices in 1947. It will beseen from this Annex and Annex II that the result is to increase the fall in the-strength of the Forces at the end of 1947 under Scheme A, as compared with theend of 1946 from 156,000 to 219,000 (i.e., an addition of 63,000 to the fall of156,000 shown in Annex II).11. Under the assumptions in paragraph 9 above apprentices in categoriesnow being deferred will be called up in 1947. It has been represented by theLord President, on behalf of the Board of Trade, and by the Minister of Supply^that this provision will bear hardly on industry in the crucial year of reconversion,and they have urged that, in the interests of industrial production and the exporttrade, apprentices should be allowed to complete their training before they are called up for military service.! There is considerable force in these representa-tions, but if apprentices are allowed to postpone their military service from the1st January, 1947, the strength of the Forces in 1947 and 1948 will be reduced-and the deficiency could be made good only by requiring trained men already:serving to serve for a.longer period.12. Having regard to our commitments during 1947 and 1948, Scheme A isthe only one of the three schemes which is likely to produce forces of the sizewhich will be required, particularly in view of the fact that the figures in Annex IIinclude recruits under training, amounting to between 50,000 and 100,000, andthat consequently the effective strength of the Services is less than the totals would^suggest. This, however, is a matter on which the Chiefs of Staff and the DefenceCommittee must be consulted.13. Annex IV is a statement of the broad distribution of the working population between the Armed Forces and civilian industry and services betweenthe end of 1946 and the end of 1948, on the assumption that the period ofconscript service will be 3 years at the 1st January 1947, falling by 6 months in 12 to 1-i years at the 1st January, 1950 (Scheme A).14.   Following is a summary of our conclusions: (1) The 1st January, 1947, would be an appropriate date on which, tointroduce the transitional scheme of fixed periods of : service(paragraph 2).(2) Three alternative schemes A, B and C (providing respectively for initialperiods of service of 3, 2-^ and 2 years falling to 1\ years by stages)designed to cover the transitional period which is likely to extend toat least 1951 have been prepared (paragraphs 3 and 4 (c) andAnnexes I and II).(3) In calculating the strengths of the Forces likely to be obtained underthese schemes certain assumptions have been made as regards regular and short-term service build up which are probably optimistic(paragraphs 4 (a) and 8).(4) As regards the treatment of men already serving, it is assumed thatthe release of men conscripted before the 1st January, 1947, will beaccording to age and length of service, but that all men conscriptedbefore the 1st January, 1947, will be released before men conscriptedfor a fixed period after that date, and that, as far as possible, allconscripts serving at the 1st January, 1947, who had completed, before that date, a period of service equal to the fixed period will be released in 1947. Fulfilment of this last principle is desirable on grounds of equity and morale, but it can be expressed as an aim and need not beregarded as a fixed rule (paragraphs 4 (b) and 5).* CP. (46) 138 and CP. (46) 126 respectively.f In the case of the engineering industry it may be possible to ameliorate the position tosome extent by increasing the facilities whereby apprentices may continue their training in theServices. We understand that the Secretary of State for War is giving special consideration tothis possibility. It is unlikely that it will be possible to extend any arrangement of this kind-beyond the engineering industry.
(5) The position of older men already serving is adequately safeguarded by continuing release on the basis of the existing age and length of servicescheme for men conscripted before the 1st January, 1947 (paragraph 6).(6) Assuming an even rate of release throughout 1947 of conscripts servingat the beginning of the year, the strength of the Army in the first half of 1947 will fall by 85,000 under Scheme A, by 115,000 under scheme B, and by 149,000 under Scheme G (paragraph 7).(7) It is assumed that apprentices will be called up until end 1947 andthat as from the 1st January, 1948, apprentices will be allowedto postpone their military service. If apprentices are not called upin 1947 the end 1947 strength of the Forces will be reduced by a further63,000 (i.e., the fall of 156,000 under Scheme A, as compared withend 1946 strength, shown in Annex II will be increased to 219,000).The Lord President (on behalf of the Board of Trade) and the Ministerof Supply feel that the call-up of apprentices in 1947 will bear hardlyon industry in the crucial year of reconversion, but if postponement is allowed in 1947 the deficiency in the strength of the Forces in 1947 and1948 could only be made good by requiring trained men already servingto serve for a longer period.(8) Some reduction might be made in the numbers of men required for theForces if it is decided to maintain the Women&apos;s Auxiliary Services(paragraph 4(d)).(9) Looking to our&quot; commitments during 1947 and 1948, we conclude that scheme A is the only one of the three schemes which is likely to produceforces of the size which will be required (paragraph 12).ANNEX I.Statement showing the Progressive Reduction in the Period of compulsory service proposed under Schemes A, B and C.Scheme A.Entrants 1st Half of 1947 serve 3-2f years.Entrants 2nd Half of 1947 serve 2f-2\ years.Entrants 1st Half of 1948 serve 2\-2\ years.Entrants 2nd Half of 1948 serve 2^-2 years.Entrants 1st Half of 1949 serve&quot; 2-lf years.Entrants 2nd Half of 1949 serve If-1^ years.Entrants from 1st Half of 1950 onwards serve \\ years.Scheme B.Entrants 1st Half of 1947 serve 2\-2\ years.Entrants 2nd Half of 1947 serve 2^-2 years.Entrants 1st Half of 1948 serve 2-lf years.Entrants 2nd Half of 1948 serve If-1-1 years.Entrants from 1st Half of 1949 onwards serve 1^ years.Scheme C.Entrants 1st Half of 1947 serve 2 years.Entrants 2nd Half of 1947 serve 2 years.Entrants 1st Half of 1948 serve 2-lf years.Entrants 2nd Half of 1948 serve lf-lj years.Entrants from 1st Half of 1949 onwards serve 1^ years.

The figures in this state-ment relate to Men only.2. The statement is notbased on proposals for actualstrengths at the dates shown,but it does show the maximumstrengths which could berealised under each of thethree schemes of call-up fora fixed period starting at1st January, 1947.3. Regulars and Short-termVolunteers. The figures foreach Scheme are based on anoptimistic estimate of the rateof recruitment.4. Conscripts enteringbefore 1st January, 1947. The numbers of&apos;these menwho can be released in eachhalf-year will depend on therelease programme, havingregard to the total strengthsrequired to meet commit-ments and the recruitment ofRegulars and short-termvolunteers.5. Conscripts entering 1stJanuary, 1947 and after. Thefigures for 1947 assume thatall apprentices at-2 called upin that year.Note.-The totals of individual figures, of service totals and grand totals do not exactly tally in all cases, since figures have been corrected to the nearest thousand.(J) Increase from end 1946 due to fall in Women strength-th.

ANNEX III.Effect on total strengths of deferment of Apprentices during 1947.The strengths shown in Annex II are based on the assumption that allapprentices reaching 18 years of age (except those in building and building materials) will be called up in 1947. The table below shows the effect of deferring the call-up of such apprentices for two years (i.e., until they havefinished their training) when they would serve for the period applicable to othersthen being oalled up.	1947.		1948.		1949.		1950.
