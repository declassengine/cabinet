/ioth ap:PRIL,  1946CABINETCIVILIAN AND COMMERCIAL SEQUIRTIAENTS for passenger SHIPS DURING THE NEXT SIX MONTHSMemorandum byby the Minister of TransportSince 1939 the primary concern of the Ministry of transport in respect of passenger ships has been to meet the requirementsof the Service Departments for movement of Service personnel.Sufficient ship-ping must still be provided to cover essentialService needs and I have retained powers to keep underrequisition the shipping needed for this purpose * but service requirements now compete with other demands upon theavailable passenger ships including those directly related to the post-war re-adjustment of the national economy.2.     Effect must, of course, be given to the existing cabinet decisions about the rate of release from the forces and leaveperiods, and it is recognised that the expeditious movementof Service personnel is of high importance because of its effect on the man-power position.      Nevertheless, my colleagues will wish to view these objectives in relation to other important aims such as the re-establishment of our shippingearnings and the movement of essential civilian personnel,including those travelling on business;    both of these are highly important to our economic and financial reconstruction.3.     At present there are, practically speaking, no Britishpassenger ships engaged in passenger services, but foreignflag passenger ships are already appearing on pre-war passenger routes:the risk to the long-term interests of British pa-ssengerservices if they cannot compete from the outset must not be under-estimated.      This applies to all routes, but withspecial force in the Atlantic trades to North America andSouth America where the prospect of dollar earnings is ofspecial significance.4*     Based on the estimates of Service personnel movementrequirements as they were known at the end of 1945, a schemefor the release and conversion of troopships which would havebeen surplus to military needs from March 1946 onwards, was drawn up by the Ministry of Transport.      This provided forthe release for the period up to June 1946 of a troopliftof some 50,000 (excluding QUEEN ELIZABETH) which wouldhave enabled some 25 passenger ships to be put in hand inshipyards throughout the country.      This plan was carefullyworked out by reference to the facilities and labour available and was designed to ensure an even flow of workin preparation for later releases and the fitting out ofnew. vessels.      The first vessels released v/ould have completed &quot;their reconversion during the second half ofthe year and were so selected that they would have beenable to provide skeleton services on the principal Britishpassenger routes.

5.      The increases in Service personnel movement requirementssince sanctioned, combined ?/ith other factors such as thetotal abandonment of the air trooping scheme from India,have so altered the position during the six months from april to September 191+6 that the programme of initialreleases of troopships for reconversion could only havebeen put into effect at the cost of a serious deficiency in meeting the military programme.      In these circumstances,some adjustment of the plans for the first instalment of releases is necessary, but I must draw attention to thefollowing serious consequences which will flow from a material postponement of the planned releases(a) There will be a delay of up to four months inthe release of the ships from service forreconversion.      The dclaj&apos; in the return ofships to passenger trades will be much greaterfor the reasons set out at (b).(b) The releases were planned to keer) the specialised labour in the finishing tradescontinuously employed.      Postponement willgreatly increase the risk of loss of thislabour from the yards.      Postponement willalso lead to a &quot;bunching&quot; of releases at alater date with the consequence that itv/ill be physically impossible to take allthe ships in hand on their release.    Thiswould either leave very valuable passengerships lying idle, and drawing hire from,the Treasury, when their services areurgently needed, or v/ould involve us in sending ships to foreign yards forreconversion.      The delay resulting fromthese man-power problems will be serious.(c) The assistance which would have been given bythe fully converted passenger ships to *the urgent problems of civilian movement willnot be forthcoming until many months later than was hoped.      This will particularlyaffect such movements as the desx^atch ofGovernment officials and employees ofcommercial firms for the rehabilitation of areas such as Malaya, which are atpresent fed with onl3r a minimum trickleof passengers. Colonial government officials and Australian emigration.    for technical reasons few such passengers cantravel on troopships.6.      These adverse consequences should not be accepted exceptfor military movements of the highest importance and directrelationship to the U.K. man-power problem.7.    &apos; The Secretaries of State for India and for theColonies have drawn attention in their papers CP. (1+6) 132and CP. (1+6) IhO respectively, to their immediate require-ments for the transport of civilians.

8.      During the past months it has been possible tomaintain only a very limited movement of civilians.In the next six months, provision had tentatively beenmade for an approximate regular movement of civilians,to and from the main areas concerned, e.g.:-500 per month to and from West Africa500/1000    &quot;       11       &quot;    &quot;       &quot;    South Africa500    &quot;       &quot;       &quot;    &quot;       &quot;   Middle East1000/1500    &quot;       &quot;       &quot;    11       11    India1000   &quot;       &quot;       &quot;    &quot;       !I   Australia andNew Zealand.These- figures provide only for a fraction of the demand and increasingly heavy pressure must be expected for extra facilities to be provided.     The only way of meeting these needs is to get ships back from militaryservice and refit them.9.     A balance must, therefore, be struck between theneeds of the services and of civilians for transport inthe next few months on the one hand, and provision for future civilian movements and for the restoration of alucrative invisible export on the other.      I am willingto reduce my programme of releases of troopships forreconversion to a minimum compatible with the considerations outlined in paragraph 5.      On the planssubmitted by the Service Departments, I can releaseonly one ship in April and none in May.      In order tokeep the programme moving I am anxious to release two ships in May and not less than five in June.      It isalso essential that releases in the quarter 1st July/30thSeptember may be phased to suit the work in the yards and not all bunched at the end of the quarter.     Thenecessary detailed adjustments should be worked outdirectly between the Ministry of Transport and theService Departments. *A.B.Ministry of Transport   W-l.10th April, I9k6
