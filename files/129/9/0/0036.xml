Our present policy inour own Zone is compatible with an eventual German federation with regionalunits having wide autonomous powers co-ordinated in certain restricted mattersby a federal body at the centre. I shall be grateful for an expression of the viewsof my colleagues on the questions raised in this paper. My own feelings at presentare that the general dangers of splitting Germany now are greater than those of continuing our present policy and that we can hope to avoid many of the dangers of centralisation by insisting on political development along federal lines.It is very likely that I shall have to deal at the present Conference in Pariswith some of these general German questions. The French Government are verykeen on the idea of federalisation, while the United States Government havehitherto strongly advocated the immediate introduction of certain centraladministrations. I would propose that when it became necessary to discuss thesequestions here I should take roughly the following line : 1&quot; The objective to be aimed at by all four Occupying Powers in guidingconstitutional and administration developments in Germany should be adecentralised federal structure based on regional units with considerableautonomous powers. When it is agreed between the Four Powers that thetime has come to set up a central German Government, they will consult together again as to the means of doing this, but the central government willin no circumstances be given such powers as would restrict the autonomous. status already given to the regional units. Meanwhile, there will be noobjection of principle to the establishment of such German central adminis-trations as may be found absolutely essential for the purpose of treatingGermany as an economic whole. The central administrations should be restricted to co-ordinating the activities of the regional units. They should act through the local German governments and their activities in each Zonewould be subject to the control of the respective Zone commanders. If theFour Powers agreed on principles of this nature the detailed application ofthem would be referred for study to the Allied Control Commission inBerlin.&quot;It seems that a proposal on these lines might go some way towards reconciling the French and American points of view and would not altogether exclude thepossibility of splitting Germany into two parts if, owing to Russian non-co-operation, this latter became inevitable.13303   [31768]
Policy towards Germany.1. I circulate as an Annex to this paper a survey of the present situationin Germany.   Its salient features are the following : -(a) Conditions in Germany.Though &apos; a beginning &quot;has been&apos; made with reconstruction, neverthelesspractically every German town is still in ruins; communications are- far fromfully restored; industrial production in the western zones is at about 15 per cent,of pre-war; there is a grievous shortage of food and coal; the population isswollen, by forced immigration from the east. Political parties and trade unions are emerging, after an initial period of political apathy. The Communistshave captured the east. Though they are active and well organised in the west,they are, as yet, only a minority.(b) Potsdam Agreement.The Potsdam Agreement set out drastic principles for the destruction ofGerman militarism and National Socialism. It removed from Germany an area in the east amounting to about a fifth of the pre-war territory. It providedfor payment of reparation by the removal of Germany&apos;s industrial equipment to a point which would leave her standard of living not higher than the averageEuropean standard. The plan subsequently agreed for this purpose will reducethe general level of industry to about half that of 1938, and reduce the heavy industries to about a third. Potsdam postulated political decentralisation andeconomic unity. Germany was to be treated as an economic whole and central german administrations were to be established to deal with economic matters,but for the time being no central German government would be established.When accepting the level of industry plan subsequently drawn up by the control commission, the British representative made the reservation that it would need to be reconsidered if the assumptions on which it was based were not fulfilled.One of these assumptions was that Germany would be treated as an economicwhole.(c) Allied administration.The central German economic administrations have not yet been set up,nor is Germany being treated as an economic whole. four-Power government at the centre is beginning to creak and the burden of government to flow to thezones which are tending to become quasi-independent.(d) Russian attitude.Three main elements may be seen in Soviet policy : (i) to prevent at all costs the revival of a strong and independent Germany;(ii) to prevent western Germany with the Ruhr, or even the Ruhr alone,being brought into any close grouping of the western democracies;(iii) to ensure that Germany eventually looks&apos; east and remains under strong,and if possible exclusive, Russian influence.The Russians have not yet come down in favour either of a unitary germany or a zonal Germany. They are, at present, hedging and making the best ofboth worlds. They have established themselves securely in their own zone, aremaking a strong bid to capture Berlin for the Communists, and are preparing to launch out on a more forward policy in the west.(e) The British zone.The economic difficulties fall most hardly on the British zone which is mostlyan industrial area and never self-supporting in food.. The industries are brokenand food imports hard to come by. The cost this year to the British Exchequerwill amount to at least  80 millions net. We are creating German authoritiesto take over responsibility for the administration and endeavouring to buildup democracy from the bottom. It is proposed to hold borough elections this autumn and plans have been laid for the holding of other elections up to theprovince level in the course of the next year. These developments would be compatible with the eventual introduction of a federal system for the whole ofGermany. Whatever the speed of these constitutional developments may be,however, both our troops of occupation and our Military Government personnelwill be greatly reduced by the end of this year.
2. Up till recent months we have thought of the German problem solely interms of Germany itself, our purpose having been to devise the best means of pre-venting the revival of a strong aggressive Germany. At times the emphasis hasbeen on re-education, though usually on controls and measures of security. Thispurpose can clearly not be discarded! It is one which we have in common with the -Russians. But it can no longer be regarded as our sole purpose, or, indeed,perhaps as our primary one. For the danger of Russia has become certainly as great as, and possibly even greater than, that of a revived Germany. The worstsituation of all would be a revived Germany in league with or dominated by russia. This, of course, greatly complicates an already complicated problem. it involves avoiding measures which would permanently alienate the Germans anddrive them into the arms of Russia. It involves again showing sufficient purposenot to.let it appear that Russia, when it comes to the point, always gets her way in four-Power discussions about Germany. It involves showing ourselves to be no less constructive in our approach to the problems in our zone than the Russiansloudly proclaim themselves to be in theirs. And, above all, it involves maintain -ing a sufficiently high standard of living in western Germany to prevent the communists from exploiting to their advantage the economic hardships suffered by the population. All this calls not only for the highest qualities of resource andtenacity but also for a readiness to use the necessary man-power and resources touphold our purpose.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in bis budget speech, pointed to our expenditure of  80 million this year on civil administration and on food for theGermans in our zone, and described this as in effect paying reparations toGermany. This revelation has caused considerable consternation to the public,and the first question for decision is therefore whether we are to go on using ourman-power and resources to uphold our position in Germany or whether we areprepared to see Russia absorbing western Germany as she has already to all practical purposes absorbed the east. It should be borne in mind that Russia canabsorb countries without spending money on them, but we cannot. The westernway of life demands a minimum of material wellbeing.4. As an occupying Power we maintain our claim to repayment and havebetter opportunity to enforce it. At the same time it is obviously essential toconsider every possible means of reducing such expenditure to the minimum.We might, for example, invite our western Allies to contribute to the renova-tion of the Ruhr coal industry on which they so greatly depend. We can insistwith the Russians that Germany must in reality be treated as an economic whole,and that the surpluses in the east are used for the benefit of the whole country.Nevertheless, however great our persuasive ability and our efforts to develop the production of our zone, there is no likelihood of its being self-supporting forsome time, or of our being able to avoid the major part of the burden of meetingits deficiencies. Not even the modification of the reparation plan would ease the immediate liabilities, since for some years to come there is no possibilityof industrial activity rising to the permitted level.5. It is easy to over-simplify this issue and regard it as one between con-tinuing our occupation and control with all the expense that is involved in that responsibility and withdrawing from Germany and so saving our pockets. but even if we were to evacuate Germany completely, we should hardly be preparedto see the country rotting in starvation. Disease knows no frontier. By with-drawing from Germany we could no doubt save ourselves some expense, but notthe whole bill, and we should have little control over the manner in which themoney was used or what type of authority in Germany, e.g., Nazi or Communist,had the use of it.6. On the assumption that we are not prepared to leave the field to Russia,the question arises whether we should be best advised to maintain and develop the present policy of Potsdam or to throw&apos; it overboard and organise our ownzone as an independent unit according to our own ideas, bringing in the otherAvestern zones as we can. The Potsdam Agreement provides for the decentralisation-tion of the German political structure but also for the establishment of central german administrations for certain economic purposes. The Agreement providesthat no central German government will be established for the time being, butit must be assumed that the establishment of central economic administrationswould logically lead in due course to the establishment of a central Government,[31768] b 2
though the powers of the latter might be considerably limited by reinforcing theautonomy of regional units in some kind of federal structure. Allied controlmay continue in some form for many years, but one cannot expect the indefiniteprolongation of Allied government. The Control Machinery Agreement on whichit is based was only designed for the initial period of occupation. Sooner or later the Germans will have to govern themselves, whether under a central govern-ment (albeit of a federal character) or state or zonal governments.7. So far as our short-term interests are concerned there can be little doubtthat they would be best served by the establishment of central administrationswithout further delay. They are essential to the treatment of Germany as aneconomic whole, and their absence gives the Russians a ready excuse for main-taining their zone as a closed area. A.s it is a larger food producing area thanwestern Germany, the barrier makes for better economic conditions in the eastthan in the west, at any rate so long as food shortages continue. It is of courseimpossible to feel any assurance that, even if central administrations were setup, the Russians would work the system honestly and would not merely try touse them to infiltrate into western Germany, while taking good care that tlheywere not used by the western Powers to infiltrate into the east. Constant vigilancewould have to be exercised to see that there was complete reciprocity betweenthe Russian and the western zones in carrying out the policy of a unitary Germany.But the existence of central administrations would at least fortify our claim,which we cannot at present assert, to penetrate the iron curtain economically, andto draw any surpluses from the east into the hard-stricken western zones. Atpresent the Russians are using their zone not only to feed the Red Army butto send home food-stuffs and manufactured goods as reparation.8. But one cannot think of the problem solely in terms of its immediateeffects, seeing that central administrations would logically develop in due courseinto a central government. It is therefore of importance to estimate in whichdirection a central German government would be likely to turn, at the sametime bearing in mind that even if western Germany were set up as a separatestate, that state might itself succumb to the communist pressure which wouldcertainly be directed against it. No firm answer can be given on the possiblecomplexion of a central German government. The Russians are probably asdoubtful about it as are we ourselves. If a central government were set up during the present period of Allied occupation and four-Power control, its composition would presumably depend on. the result of nation-wide elections, con-ducted under four-Power supervision. It may be assumed that the Communists,or the new Socialist Unity Party, would gain the upper hand in the Soviet zone.The same is also probable, though not so certain, in Berlin. According to present indications in the United States zone and in regions of North Rhine andWestphalia of the British zone, the Christian Democratic Union would probablybe the largest party. In Hanover Region and Hamburg the Social Democratswould probably be the strongest, with in Hamburg a substantial communist andin Hanover Region a substantial right-wing runner up. In Schleswig-Holsteinthe right-wing parties would probably prevail. If the German government inBerlin fairly reproduced the outlook of the country it would be neither whollyeastward looking nor wholly westward looking. The question would then turnon whether the western democracies or the Soviet Union would exercise the stronger pull. On the whole the balance of advantage seems to lie with theRussians. It is highly unlikely that the western democracies would be ableto exercise any influence in the east, at any rate outside Berlin itself. On theother hand, Communism already has its addicts in western Germany, and theliberal attitude of the occupying authorities in the west would allow them a freehand. Added to this would be the constant pressure of propaganda and ofagents from the east. And the prevailing material conditions would give theman excellent ground for their activities. They would find the position favourableboth in the short-term and in the long-term. For the next year or so, no matterhow great our efforts, one must expect hunger, cold and lack of shelter. later on the level of industry plan will&apos; take effect, causing large-scale unemployment and preventing any.rapid reconstruction. In such conditions Communism willhave an obvious appeal and, with its emphasis on strong authoritarian govern-ment, can be plausibly represented as the only kind of system which can possiblycope with so desperate a situation. Even if the first national elections gave the democratic parties the advantage, one must feel greater doubt about the subsequent ones.
9. A federal system for Germany would minimise these dangers. It wouldbe based on the grant of considerable autonomous pOwers to the provinceswith a co-ordinating body at the centre whose powers would be strictly limited. It would be necessary to examine exactly what division of powers wouldbe most suitable, with a general tendency to restrict the powers of the centre tothe barest minimum necessary for its co-ordinating function. The powersreserved for the centre would be mainly those concerned with economics and finance, though there might be no objection to leaving even certain financialpowers to the provinces, which might, for instance, be allowed to organise theirown social security services. Under a scheme of this kind central administrations,whether set up now under the Allied Control machinery or later under a federal german government, would act through the local German governments and wouldbe prevented so far as possible from organising a network of their own agenciesthroughout Germany. It may be objected that a federal structure of this kind would not be likely to offer serious resistance to communist influence at the centre,since the latter would be able, with even a small amount of military or para-military force (organised no doubt with Russian assistance) to swallow up thedisarmed and divided regional units one by one. This danger exists, but on the.whole it seems less serious than to provide the communists with a centralisedmachine ready to hand, such as Hitler found when he came to power as a resultof the centralising tendencies which had operated in Germany since the timeof Bismark.10. In seeking a solution of our dilemma the following considerations shouldbe borne in mind. Though we could argue that the principles laid down atPotsdam were only designed for the initial control period and are therefore nowdue for reconsideration, nevertheless to throw the Potsdam policy overboardentirely and organise our zone as an independent unit would have very grave consequences -: (a) We should be unable to retain for long even the facade of four-Powerco-operation in Germany and should soon find ourselves forced out of berlin.(b) The hopes we still entertain of breaking down the iron curtain wouldhave to be abandoned. The whole of eastern Germany and indeed of eastern Europe would be irretrievably lost to Russia.(c) We should also have to defend our zone (or western Germany) from theinfection of political and economic influences from the east. Forexample, we should have to set up a separate currency and almost certainly a separate nationality.(d) All this which would in effect amount to bringing western Germanyinto a western anti-Soviet bloc ^would mean an irreparable break with the Russians, who would go all out to destroy our policy in western Germany and turn the population against us. This task would not be difficult in an industrial area in a period of acute food shortage. They would, no doubt, also redouble their attacks on us inall other parts of the world, and the prospect of U.N.O. continuingin such circumstances would be slender.(e) The Americans are, probably not yet ready for this.   Certainly theirleading representatives in Germany would oppose it tooth and hail.In any case one could not count on continued American supporteven if they came to agree to it. But full American support wouldbe essential.(/) The French might or might not support us, depending on the strengthof communism in France. In any case Communist influence wouldbe strong enough to make their support an uncertain factor.[g) The Belgians and Dutch (as indeed all minor Allies) would be distressedby any reduction of reparation which would be involved in organisingwestern Germany for prosperity, but the prospect of restoring aprosperous trade with Germany might reconcile them to the loss tosome extent. They would be less easily reconciled to the &quot; forgive andforget&quot; attitude towards the western Germans which our new policy would necessarily involve. Their love for German Socialists is no greater than their love for other Germans.(h) We should find ourselves at the mercy of German blackmail &quot; We mustbe given this and that, or we shall be overwhelmed by the Communists.&apos;&apos;We should probably soon have to accept a German army.
(i) The fear and contempt which Germans feel for Russia, coupled withtheir unforgiving resentment at the loss of the eastern provinces,might keep them content for a time with holding Russia at the Elbe.But, whether we like it or not, the conception of German unity is abasic fact which has survived many centuries and is unlikely to be destroyed by any artificial creation established to-day. Sooner or later the east and the west would join up again.(j) Meanwhile we should have lost the one factor which might hold us andthe Russians together, viz., the existence of a single Germany which itwould be to the interest of us both to hold down.11. The foregoing are powerful arguments against abandoning the Potsdampolicy and setting out to organise our own zone or western Germany as a separateunit. On the other hand a &quot;western&quot; policy, if developed with determina-tion and subject to the conditions mentioned in paragraph 12 below, could have certain attractions : -(a) It would be clear both to the Russians and to the Germans that we were determined to resist the further westward expansion of Russianinfluence and of communism. In this we could expect the support ofthe great majority of Germans, whose assistance we should have in resisting the infiltration of agents from the east.(b) By denouncing the level of industry plan and limiting reparation to more reasonable proportions we should give the western Germans a hope for the future even though it would in itself bring them littleimmediate material benefit.(c) If the German population became more  contented, by seeing our determination to save them from the Russians and restore theireconomy, the tasks of our authorities would be lightened, as also wouldthose of the German authorities as they take over responsibility for administration.12. It must, however, be stressed that two conditions are essential to thesuccess of a &quot; western &quot; policy. The first is that we should give an immediatefillip to the population by raising the food ration and maintaining it at asatisfactory level. Even if the level of industry plan was discarded, we mustreckon with an interval of two or three years before German industries could beso far rehabilitated as to render western Germany self-supporting. Secondly, wemust be assured of full and continued support from the United States.13. Whatever decision be taken on this fundamental problem, there arecertain matters which we should keep to the forefront of our policy.  These are : (a) to concentrate on constructive measures in our zone, both political andeconomic, and refuse to be deflected from our course by the Russians or such satellites as the World Federation of Trade Unions;(&amp;) to accelerate constitutional development in our zone and to develop thelocal autonomy of the provincial governments, giving them the widestpracticable powers and organising them in such a way that they willfit into a federated structure either for the western zones or for germany as a whole;(c) to maintain and, if possible, increase the present food ration in theBritish zone and western Germany as a whole, and to use every pressure to extract food surpluses from the Russian zone for the benefit of therest of Germany;(d) to take every possible step to increase coal production and see that asufficient proportion is devoted to the re-activation of german industry;(e) to apply the economic principles of Potsdam to the western zones even ifthe Russians refuse to collaborate, and in any case to foster the solidarity of the western zones;(/) to act in fullest collaboration with the Americans;(g) to maintain our position in Berlin. .14. The measures suggested in the preceding paragraph are not a substitute for a permanent policy, but until we see more clearly what is likely to be thefuture of the Ruhr, the most important single problem affecting our position inGermany, it is difficult to come to a final decision. It must be recognised, how-ever, that the question of central economic administrations, which the United
States Government still feel to be one of the most urgent requirements for allied policy in Germany, raises the fundamental issue whether Germany is to be asingle state or split into eastern and western Germany corresponding to theRussian Zone and the three Western Zones respectively. If agreement wasreached between the four Powers that we should all gradually work towards- arfederall system in Germany, into which the proposed new Province of the Ruhrwould fit, this might allow the decision to be somewhat postponed, but it cannotbe indefinitely avoided. If it was felt that we had to abandon the idea of a unified Germany, even with a federal system, it would be most important to ensurethat responsibility for the break was put squarely on the Russians.E.

ANNEX.SURVEY OF PRESENT SITUATION IN GERMANY.I. Allied Government and Policy.Declaration of Defeat,1. Germany surrendered on the 7th May, 1945. On the 5th June aDeclaration regarding the Defeat of Germany was signed in Berlin by repre-sentatives of the United Kingdom, United States, U.S.S.R. and France, whoseGovernments thereby assumed supreme authority with respect to Germany. Thegeneral conditions in which they undertook this responsibility were thatpractically every large town in Germany was in ruins, the communications hadbeen disrupted and the administration had disappeared. That immediatestarvation and epidemics did not se.t in was due to the existence of considerablefood reserves and to the efforts of the Allied military administration.Control Machinery.2. Plans had already been worked out for the Allied government ofGermany. These provided for the exercise of the supreme authority by the commanders-in-Chief of the four Powers, each of whom is supreme in his ownzone of occupation, while in matters affecting Germany as a whole they constitutejointly a supreme organ of control called the Control Council. The whole ofGermany is under military occupation and is for that purpose divided into fourzones. Berlin is jointly occupied in four sections and is administered by a four-Power body known as the Komendatura.Potsdam A greement.3. The first public statement of Allied policy was issued after the Crimea conference in February 1945. This was supplemented by the Potsdam Agreementof August 1945. The Potsdam Agreement set out the purposes of the occupationas (i) complete disarmament and demilitarisation, (ii) to convince the Germanpeople of their total defeat and of their own responsibility for their presentsuffering, (iii) to destroy National Socialism, and (iv) &quot; to prepare for the eventual reconstruction of German political life on a democratic basis and for eventual peaceful co-operation in international life by Germany.&quot;4. Among the political principles to govern the treatment of Germany in the initial control period were the following : (a) that so far as practicable there should be uniformity of treatment of theGerman population throughout Germany;(b) that the administration in Germany should be directed towards thedecentralisation of the political structure and the development of localresponsibility. This would include the restoration of local self-government on democratic and elective principles, the permission and encouragement of all democratic parties, and the introduction of therepresentative and elective principle into regional and provincialadministrations. For the time being no central German Governmentwould be established, but certain essential central German adminis-trative departments would be set up in the economic field, acting underthe direction of the Control Council.5. Economic principles were also set out, and agreement was reached onreparation. The main features of these two sections were that the production ofwar material would be prohibited, the production of war-important industriesrigidly controlled and restricted to Germany&apos;s peace-time needs, and surplusproductive capacity removed as reparation or destroyed; but payment of repara-tions should leave enough resources to enable the German people to subsist withoutexternal assistance at a standard of living not exceeding the average standard ofEuropean countries excluding the United Kingdom and the U.S.S.R. Thefirst charge on exports should be for approved imports. The reparationclaims of Russia and Poland would be met by removals from the Soviet zone,and those of the other Allies from the western zones; but Russia would also receive 25 per cent, of the equipment removed from the western zones, part of
which she would exchange for raw materials of equivalent value. The amountof equipment to be removed from the western zones would be determined within six months, viz., by the 2nd February, 1946. It was also laid down that duringthe period of occupation Germany would be treated as a single economic unit and that primary emphasis would be given to the development of agricultureand peaceful domestic industries.6. It was decided at Potsdam to transfer to Polish administration theformer German territories east of the Oder-Western Neisse line (except forthe area around Konigsberg which would be handed over to Russia). It wasagreed that the German populations of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary,would be transferred to Germany in an orderly and humane manner in accord-ance with a plan to be drawn up by the Control Council. The Control Councilagreed on a plan to this effect in November 1945.II. General Situation To-Day.Four-Power co-operation.7. The end of the war left Germany a vacuum. The question still to bedecided is how this vacuum is to be filled, and the answer will be a touchstoneof Great Power collaboration. The general conception at the planning stagewas that the four Powers should fill the gap by jointly exercising the supreme authority until such time as Germany had been purged of her vices and could safely be permitted to resume her own independent place in the Europeanstructure. The first essential to the success of this policy is, of course, that thefour Powers should maintain a united front and,&apos; so long as matters of highpolicy have not supervened, harmony has not been lacking. Personal relations were for the most part good, and in certain important matters the interests ofthe four Powers coincide. There is, for example, no disagreement in principle on the need to disarm Germany. Agreement has been reached on such big issues as denazification, the reform of the judicial system and the future level ofGerman industry. Nevertheless, the spirit of co-operation has tended to weakenas fundamental issues arise involving national interests and ideologies. no power is at present strong enough to capture Germany as a whole, nor is theorganisation for so doing at present in existence. But in its own zone eachPower is doing its best to sow its own beliefs which, in so far as the East and west are concerned, are diametrically opposed.8. This fundamental antagonism between the totalitarian and the liberalcreeds, both of which claim to represent the true democracy, has been somewhatoverclouded by extraneous disputes. The French, not having been invited tothe Potsdam Conference, were critical of its conclusions from the start and, inparticular, of the decision to set up German central administrations. Theyargued that the existence of such administrations, if given authority over thewhole of German territory, would inevitably prejudice their aim to detach the ruhr and the Rhineland from Germany. For this reason they have used theirveto on the Control Council to block the establishment of these administrations.Their intransigence has exasperated the Americans whose great purpose it isto get the main Potsdam objectives, such as disarmament and denazification,finished off as quickly as possible and then hand over the administration to theGermans. American exasperation has not been limited to criticism of theFrench. We, too, have had our fair share of it, owing to our slower and morecautious approach deriving from our long-term interest in the future of Germany.But the Americans in Berlin have usually been careful to keep on the right sideof the Russians, with the unfortunate result that there has at times been almosta Russo-American bloc in the Control Commission. This, of course, has suitedthe Russians very well, and they have exercised much ingenuity in singlingus out for criticism and, at the same time, flattering the Americans.Central and zonal administration.9. Quadripartite government is itself an unprecedented experiment. Inthis troubled atmosphere and unaided as it is by any central Germanadministrative authority, it is bound to creak and the burden - of governmentto flow to the zones which tend to become quasi-independent, each administeredaccording to the views of the occupying Power. This tendency is furthestadvanced in the Russian zone and, though their unit of administration still remains the &quot;Land,&quot; they have gone so far in the process towards zonal
administration that they could set up a zonal government without difficulty atany time that suited them. &quot;We in our zone work on the province or &quot;Land&quot;but have established zonal advisory bodies and are contemplating the establish-ment of certain zonal executive bodies. The Americans work direct from theirown element of the Control Commission to the three &apos;&apos; Land &apos;&apos; Governments intheir zone and the only co-ordination between the three &quot;Lander&quot; lies inconferences between the &quot; Land &quot; Governments. The French, who are weddedto the idea of decentralisation, have not set up any zonal organisation in theirzone but are rather following the American plan of building up the provinces.10. The Potsdam Agreement postulated political decentralisation andeconomic unity. Political autonomy in the zones would therefore not beinherently contrary to Potsdam. At the same time the zonal boundaries werenot drawn up for that purpose. In some cases, e.g., in Baden and Wurtemberg,they cut across the old state boundaries. In any event it is scarcely conceivable that they will be maintained indefinitely after the occupation has come to an end,if only for the reason that they will recall the period of German humiliation.There can be no permanent political future for an independent zone. In theeconomic sphere the division of the country into zones is of greater immediateconsequence. Germany was developed as an economic unit, as was recognised atPotsdam. Each part inevitably suffers if the zonal frontiers are trade barriers;and the British zone, being the least self-supporting in foodstuffs, suffers worst of all. To-day there is a very limited interzonal trade and&apos; an interzonal postal,telegraph and telephone system has begun to operate. It has also been agreedthat a four-Power commission shall proceed to all four zones to watch over theapplication of the reparation plan. But the zones are now, in large measure,artificially separated economic units and this, together with the absence of centraleconomic administrations, is greatly impeding efforts at reconstruction. above all, no sound financial system can be looked for without a financial administrationat the centre.Transfer of populations.11. The foregoing difficulties arise because part of the Potsdam agreement has not been carried out. There are no central German administrations andGermany is not being treated as a single economic unit. Other difficulties are due to the precisely opposite reason that the Potsdam Agreement is being carriedout. Potsdam laid down that the German populations remaining in Poland,Czechoslovakia and Hungary should be transferred into Germany, which wasitself greatly reduced in area by the loss of the eastern provinces. The exodushad already started on a considerable scale before the war ended. But thecompletion of the transfer involves, according to the plan subsequently worked out by the Control Council, no less than 6-J million persons. The Control Councilagreed that these should be transferred by the end of July 1946. Though this date will certainly not be kept and though the Potsdam Agreement laid clown thatthe transfers should be carried out in an orderly and humane manner, nevertheless the operation cannot fail to constitute one of the major problems which theauthorities in Germany will have to face. These people arrive with fewbelongings and little money and often in a poor state of health. An unduly high proportion of them are women, children and old men. The prospect of theirfinding either work or homes is meagre and they also create an additional drain on the already inadequate food supplies.Reparation and level of industry.12. A further decision taken at Potsdam which will have the gravest effecton Germany&apos;s economy is that relating to reparation and the level of german industry. It was already agreed at the Crimea Conference that Germany shouldmake compensation in kind to the greatest extent possible for the damage she had caused. The principles according to which this should be carried out were agreed at Potsdam and have been summarised in paragraph 5 above. The nextstep was to determine what Germany&apos;s level of industry should be and, afterlong and at times embittered discussion, the Control Council eventually approved a plan on the 30th March, 1946. Under this plan certain industries of particular importance to war purposes are to be eliminated entirely, while others will be restricted to various percentages of the pre-war level. No restriction on theother hand is to be placed on peaceful industries, while the production of coal
is to be maximised. It is estimated that the general effect will be to reduce thelevel of industry as a whole to a figure of about 50-55 per cent, of the 1938 level.But the heavy industries are to be more drastically reduced than others, the productive capacity remaining to them being of the order of a third of pre-war.Steel capacity is reduced to 7-5 million tons a year, and the actual production is not to exceed 5-8 million tons without the specific approval of the control council.13. This plan is far more drastic than His Majesty&apos;s Government had wished, but it was found impossible to stand out against the combined deter-mination of the other three Powers. All that proved possible was to enter the reservation that the plan would call for revision in the event of any of the mainassumptions on which it was based being altered. Such assumptions were thatthe western frontiers of Germany would not be changed, that Germany would betreated as a single economic unit, that the population would not exceed66^ million, and that it would be possible for exports to pay for imports to theextent contemplated in the plan.14. The Russians had an understandable interest in insisting on a drasticsolution. In the first place they are to receive 25 per cent, of the proceeds byway of reparation. Secondly, they are determined to eliminate any risk of thewestern Powers having a powerful German war potential at their disposal.Thirdly, a low standard of living in the western zones will facilitate the spread of communism into those areas. The attitude of the Americans is less easy tounderstand. They may perhaps have been influenced by the desire to be rid of a commercial competitor, or by the Morgenthau tradition of pastoralisingGermany, but even so slum conditions in the heart of Europe are unlikely to beto their permanent advantage. The French can, of course, not be expected to resist any measure, however shortsighted, that will weaken Germany.15. It is impossible to make any accurate forecast of the effect that this plan will have upon Germany. At the moment the level of industrial production is still far below the amount permitted by the plan. In the western zones it isrunning at about 15 per cent, of pre-war. What the plan does is to ensure thatGermany&apos;s economy will hot be allowed to rise above a very low standard foran indefinite period. Large-scale unemployment, increased still further by theinflux of refugees, must therefore be expected as a more or less permanent stateof affairs. Added to which there will be the psychological effect upon thepopulation of seeing their sources of employment removed or destroyed. It isunfortunate that the British zone is the area which will suffer worst from theseeffects.Food crisis.16. The immediate impact of the level of industry plan will then be chieflypsychological. Food and coal on the other hand are vital problems to-day. Theworld food crisis is common knowledge. But there are a number of reasons why it falls particularly severely on Germany. Before the war Germany was up toabout 90 per cent, self-supporting in foodstuffs, thanks to a highly-developed and protected agriculture and to the large-scale production of artificial fertilisers.The economy was centrally organised so that the surpluses from one areasupplied the deficiencies of another. In particular there was ,a large flow of foodstuffs from the agricultural east to the western industrial districts. Largetracts of these producing areas have now been detached from Germany. Theeastern territories were also depopulated and devastated by war. Furthermorethe central planning has disappeared. Such surpluses as there may still be inthe east and their present volume or even existence is unknown are retained by the Russians for their own purposes. Imports on a heavy scale are thereforeneeded to maintain a bare subsistence for the population of the western zones.When the war ended, these areas were still in possession of considerable stocks,largely drawn from the liberated countries. To-day those stocks have been usedup, and this at the very moment when the whole world is faced with an unprecedent-dented food shortage. It is only natural that Germany should come low on the list of claimants. The result has been that we have had to reduce the rationin the British zone to just over 1,000 calories for the ordinary consumer andthe Americans have had to come down to 1,275. The ration in the French zoneis theoretically at about 1,000 calories, but it is doubtful whether this is being maintained in practice. These levels are not sufficient for health. Yet there isno immediate prospect of raising them.   Food has therefore become the major
problem of the man in the street in western Germany as well as of the Alliedauthorities. Upon the solution of this problem depends not only our good nameas administrators but any hope we have of re-eduoating the Germans. Democracyas understood in the west cannot be built on starvation. For the Russians things are easier. In the first place they have the food producing land if they like touse it. Secondly, their way of life has less need of healthy economic conditions -as a foundation.Coal.17. Equal in importance to food is the question of coal. Indeed, the twoproblems interlock. When we first entered Germany, coal production hadvirtually ceased. Thanks to the efforts of our authorities it was gradually built up again until by the beginning of March 1946 the hard coal output was1 -1 million tons per week or about 40 per cent, of the 1938 level. The cut in thefood ration, which fell on the specially favoured miners as on everyone else, hadan immediate repercussion and production quickly dropped by about 20 per cent.Nor is it likely to rise appreciably unless and until the ration is raised. It mayindeed fall still lower. The effect of this cannot be overstated. There ispractically no economic activity in Germany which does not depend on coal for itssource of power. It affects food production as it affects everything else. until more coal is forthcoming, economic activity will continue to stagnate, and eventhe level of industrial production permitted by the Control Council&apos;s plan will notbe reached. Nor is the coal now produced devoted solely to Germany&apos;s domesticneeds. On the contrary the present governmental directive is that the maximum possible should go to export and only so much be retained in Germany as is needed to meet the minimum requirements of the occupation. And even this does not satisfy the French who persistently demand that the percentage for export shouldbe raised regardless of the effect of such a measure either on Germany itself oron the mining industry from which the coal is derived. Coal in fact is a crucialproblem whether regarded from the point of view of our administration ofGermany or from that of our relations with our Allies.German political developments.18. German political development is naturally affected by these day-to-dayproblems of existence. It would in any case have been unreasonable to expect a population which has been denied all political expression and contact with the outside world for so long to make at once much intelligent use of the liberty which foreign armies had bestowed upon it. And of course this liberty was itselfcircumscribed by the necessities of military government, not to mention such material impediments as the disruption of all communications and the destructionof all the big towns. It is not surprising therefore that all early reports fromGermany spoke of the political apathy of the population. Nevertheless, political parties have started to revive. In the east the Communists with strong Russianbacking have made the running and are well on the way towards eliminatingor absorbing all other parties. The single party system is likely soon to be anaccomplished fact in the Russian zone. In the western zones the most important political parties are the Social Democrats and the Christian Democratic Union,neither of which have any inclination to make a united front with the Communists.The latter are an active and well organised minority but have hitherto been unableto make much headway without the support of the Red Army. Their future prospects will depend on the effectiveness of the policy of the Western Alliesand on the degree of material well-being which the latter succeed in maintaining.But there is one objective in which all parties are united, and that is the preservation-tion of German unity. Opinions may differ on whether Germany should bea centralised or federal State, but any suggestion that she should be dismemberedis anathema to all alike. In the campaign for German unity the Communists havecleverly taken the lead, cynically ignoring the immense truncations which theirRussian backers have imposed in the east. The other parties cannot oppose them on this issue, which is perhaps the only one on which all Germans think alike.Trade Unions.19. Along with political development trade unions have started to formagain. Here, too, there has been considerable apathy in the rank and file, butthey have been encouraged by the interest shown by trade union organisationsabroad. A T.U.C. delegation has visited the British zone, while a delegation of the World Federation has been to Berlin and toured the whole country. Themanner in which trade union development should proceed is not yet settled.
The T.U.C. advised strongly in favour of the British system of a confederation of autonomous unions. For the most part German opinion seems to inclinerather towards a single centralised union, and this is likely to be favoured bythe World Federation, which seems to be largely an agent of Russian&apos; policy.As elsewhere, the Russians hope to capture the trade union movement in Germanyand create out of it a powerful weapon for attaining their political ends.Denazification.20. After their visit to Germany the World Federation issued a report,and its recommendations were significant. Most of the immediate practical problems of reconstruction were ignored. No reference, for example, was madeto the food crisis, unemployment, the need for reconstruction or production, orto the refugee problem. Chief emphasis was laid on denazification, on whichthe attitude of the officers of military government was strongly criticised.Denazification is, of course, a matter of the first importance. It is impossibleto leave the development of Germany to the men who played leading parts underthe Nazi regime. The difficulty is to find other people of experience and ability.A further problem is the danger of creating a large body of ruthless discontentedpersons who will have no outlet for their energies except to sabotage any orderlygovernment that may emerge. Such difficulties are ignored alike by the WorldFederation and by the Russians, whose purpose seems to be to create the maximumdislocation in the western zones and be left free to organise their own zone intheir own way. They have no compunction in using Nazis where it suits them,and, of course, the two have much in common. It is unfortunate that we so often find ourselves on the defensive on the question of denazification, whichis used as a stick to beat us with by the Russians who themselves appear to be interested in exploiting denazification as a measure of class warfare.III. Situation in the Zones.A. British Zone.Administration and politics.21. When the British forces first took over in the zone most things had come to a standstill. The immediate job was to knock some sort of shape outof the chaos left behind by the collapse; to get the coal mines working, therailways running, canals and waterways cleared, bridges repaired, fooddistributed and displaced persons repatriated. It is everywhere agreed that our military authorities made a fine job of it. The zone has been regarded by many as the best run, and the behaviour of the British soldier, his common sense andfairness, made him the most popular of the foreign troops in Germany. Howfar the food crisis will change this remains to be seen.22. In the early days direct military government was the only method ofadministration possible, if only because the local German administration haddisappeared. The change is now being made to civilian control. The army corps Commanders, who have hitherto been military governors of their districts,will confine their duties to that of garrison commander. Civilian regional commissioners will be appointed to each of the five regions in the zone. Amongthe subordinate staffs civilians are replacing soldiers. The change serves twopurposes. In the first place, it is necessitated by the shortage of service officersresulting from demobilisation. Secondly, it is part of our definite policy of placing responsibility on the Germans for their own administration. british control and supervision will take the place of direct government except insubjects which are necessarily reserved.23. The German bodies to whom these responsibilities are being trans-ferred are at present councils nominated by the British authorities. Suchcouncils have already been established at almost all district levels and at certain of the higher levels. The intention is to replace them in due course by electedcouncils.   The present provisional time-table for elections is District elections, Autumn, 1946;Regional elections, Spring, 1947;Zonal elections, Summer or Autumn, 1947.24. In addition to the provincial and local councils, a start has been madewith establishing machinery to cover the whole zone.   Early in March a zonal
advisory council was set up, composed of civil servants, technicians and repre-sentatives of the political parties, trade unions and the co-operative movement.There is also an economic advisory board and a zonal finance department, andin addition a central office for food and agriculture with executive powers. Itis too early to say how effective these bodies will prove to be. ^25. Our policy is to build democracy from the bottom upwards. political parties were at first approved only on a local basis, but now they are permitted to organise on a zonal basis. Though there was at first widespread politicalapathy, a number of parties are now showing activity. The three main parties,the Social Democratic Party (S.D.P.), the Communist Party (K.P.D.) and the christian Democratic Union (C.D.U.) conform to the prevalent continentalpattern. There are in addition the Lower Saxon Party, the Free Democrat Party,both fairly Right wing and likely to amalgamate, and the Centre Party(Catholic). This has so far refused to merge with the C.D.U., which standssomewhat more to the Right than the Centre Party.26. The Social Democrats are at present probably the strongest partynumerically in the zone. Their leading figure, Schumacner, is an outstandingpersonality. Courage, personal integrity, a strong anti-Nazi record and evenstronger Socialist convictions, have made him the spokesman, though not alwaysunchallenged, of the Social Democrats in the three western zones and in a lesserway of the independent Socialists in Berlin. The main points of the party policyinclude nationalisation of industry and social reform, German territorial integrity and political unity, the independence of the party as against the communists and the attraction of the middle-class and workers&apos; vote in supportof democracy on a western pattern.27. The Communist Party follows the Berlin-Moscow line. Its main aimsare German unity (the Ruhr for the worker), S.P.D./K.P.D. fusion in a SocialistUnity Party with a view to establishing a workers&apos; republic on a single partybasis, and the realisation of Marxist as opposed to western democracy. It is out-spoken in its criticism of British policy, particularly in respect of denazificationand food. This criticism is likely to find many sympathisers unless the food situation improves.28. The Christian Democratic Union favours private enterprise andreligious freedom. It attracts former property owners and can hope to obtain a large proportion of the Nazi vote, though the possibility that many nominaland other Nazis may vote on the Communist ticket should not be excluded. Itcould hardly hope to survive a prolonged depression. It is in touch with the christian Socialist Union, its counterpart in the American zone, which was themost successful party in the only elections so far held.29. The trade union movement in the British zone was slow to develop.This is hardly surprising as it is clearly difficult to reconcile the exigencies ofmilitary government with trade union activities. Recent development has been more rapid. No estimate of the total numbers for the zone is available. Thefollowing figures give some indication of the position at the end of March. NorthRhine Province, 470,000; Hamburg 130,000; Cologne 35,000; Hanover 20,000;Duisburg 20,000; Wuppertal 20,000. Trade unions are not allowed to indulge in political activities, nor have they much say in hours of work or wages whichhave largely been fixed by Control Council legislation. This leaves little scopeexcept for discussion on conditions of work and denazification of industry. Theimmediate major issue is organisational, whether unions should be organisedcentrally or on a basis of autonomous unions. The T.U.C. delegation whichvisited Germany in November recommended in favour of autonomous unionsso as to give the rank and file their proper say and prevent them being run fromabove. The German workers on the whole, however, seem to favour centralisationas giving them increased strength. At the first zonal trade union conferenceheld in Hanover on the 12th March it was decided to establish four provisionalorganising committees and also a zonal organising committee. This was roughlyon the lines recommended by the World Federation of Trade Unions. The large-scale unemployment which is likely to result from the level of industry plan mustbe expected to have a powerful effect on trade union opinion.Economic Background.30. To meet occupational and minimum civilian requirements the following main industries were put into operation when the reorganisation of the essential
industries began : steel, mining supplies, agricultural machinery, textiles,building materials, chemicals (fertilisers, soap, pharmaceutical products,vaccines). A plan known as the Spartan plan was devised to co-ordinateessential supplies of coal, iron, steel, timber and power, all in short supply, to basic industries. The targets set under this plan are inevitably low. The quota of steel output planned for the second quarter of this year is no more than400,000 tons, which is only a fraction of that permitted by the level of industryplan. Insufficient steel in its turn affects the coal output for which both the other german industries and the European countries are desperately competing. Thegeneral situation is bad. The over-all industrial production of the zone at theend of February was estimated at 15 per cent, of the pre-war level. Progressin restoring industrial output is limited by shortage of transport, steel, coal andother raw materials. Given the low industrial output, unemployment is atpresent surprisingly small. The latest figures show only 360,000 unemployed,with 275,000 unemployable. They may, however, conceal some hidden unem-ployment as workers still hold considerable savings and may not trouble to look for work while there is so little to buy for their wages.31. The administration of the Ruhr mines is conducted by a Britishorganisation named the North German Coal Control. The former owners havebeen expropriated and the ownership is held for the time being by Britishcustodians. Before the recent cut in the food ration, production of coal had been raised to about 40 per cent, of pre-war, or over a million tons a week. 225,000 menwere working in the Ruhr mines in February, 1946, and great, though not very successful, efforts were being made to increase the man-power in the industry.The immediate prospect is not good for the following reasons : the miners andtheir families are underfed, there is shortage of trained man-power, manyexperienced managers and foremen have been removed on account of their Nazisympathies, the machinery needs renovation, but this is rendered impossible bythe governmental directive which gives the lion&apos;s share of the production to export.32. Of even greater immediate importance than coal is the problem offood. Here the situation is nothing less than alarming. It has already been referred to in Section II of this Annex. The acuteness of this problem may be judged by the fact that our present efforts are directed not to increasing the1,000 calorie ration, but to preventing its further reduction. But this scale ofnourishment means slow starvation and, if it is not soon improved, the conse-quences, both physical and moral, will be incalculable.33. A further problem that deserves mention is that of housing. Its serious-ness needs no emphasis and will be increased by the further influx of refugees from Poland, of whom 1^ million are to be expected in the zone during the coming months.Occupation Forces.34. It is hoped that by the end of the year the numbers of the British forcesof occupation, including the Air Force, will be reduced to about 137,000. Theywill be supplemented by two Belgian divisions, and it is possible that some ofthe other western Allies may make a contribution. The establishment of theBritish Element of the Control Council is to be reduced to 20,000 by the end ofthe year.Occupation Costs.35. In his budget speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer gave a figure of 80 million as the estimate for the cost of civil administration and food imports.This is a nett figure after deducting the prospective proceeds of exports. nor does it include the cost of the military establishment. The present figure forthe pay and allowances of the troops of occupation is about  65 million a year.This will, of course, be reduced as the numbers of the occupying forces are brought down. The most serious expenditure is on food imports, as for the- greater partthey are paid for in dollars. The Potsdam Agreement provided that imports should constitute a first charge on exports, but it is unlikely that all importswill be covered in this way for a considerable time. Discussions are proceeding with our Allies with a view to modifying the present arrangements which weigiiparticularly heavily on the British zone.
B.  United States Zone.Administration and Politics.36. The Americans approached the problem from the standpoint of getting^quick results. Their aim was twofold : first, to &quot; liquidate &quot; the war by drasticimplementation of the Potsdam provisions in respect of denazification, disarma-ment, demilitarisation and de-industrialisation; secondly, to transfer to theGermans as quickly as practicable responsibility for administration both in the zone and at the centre. The Germans would be encouraged to work for recoveryand to establish a democratic Germany with a peaceful economy, sufficient toensure an average European standard of living.37. The kind of time-table the Americans appear to have set themselveswas as follows : Elections at the lowest level (January, 1946).Elections at rural and municipal district levels (March and May, 1946).&quot; Land &quot; elections for the three State legislatures : Bavaria, Hesse,Wurtemberg-Baden (October, 1946).Central German administrations for economic purposes to be establishedimmediately after Potsdam.The second phase of control, that of &quot; gradual recovery,&quot; to start fromthe 2nd February, 1946, the date on which the reparation plan was to bedetermined in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.Transfer from military to civilian control to take place on the 1st June.1946.Main tasks of occupation to be finished by the end of 1947. Zonalfrontiers could be opened and a German administration set up. In 1948the occupational forces could be withdrawn and by the end of that year thepeace could be signed.  The military phase would be over.Control would be exercised for a further ten to fifteen years. germany would then join T7.N.O.38. This general approach, based on the principle of indirect control and a relatively short occupation, had numerous attractions. Germany&apos;s war potentialwould be drastically eliminated; the &apos;&apos; boys &apos;&apos; could be got home quickly; indirectcontrol would permit of economy in American man-power; Germany would beself-supporting at an early date.39. Things have not worked out altogether as the Americans hoped. Atthe centre their hope of transferring responsibility to the Germans for economic matters has been blocked by the refusal of the French to agree to central Germanadministrations. In the zone the American administration, though not withoutmerits it has shown remarkable efficiency, for example, in restarting public services and repairing the transport system- has on the whole been disappointing.This is perhaps due fundamentally to the fact that the average American doesnot belong in Europe and is only anxious to get home. In this the Americansoldiers, whether of the forces of occupation or of military government, have beenall too successful, and continuity of administration has been woefully hampered by perpetual changes in personnel due to demobilisation. The hoped-for transfer from military to civilian control has, moreover, been blocked at Washington by the refusal of the State Department to take over the responsibility.40. There have been sensational stories of misbehaviour by the G-Ls (thesternest critics being the American home press) and, though these are no doubtmuch exaggerated, the fact remains that the G.I.s do not seem to have earnedgreat respect from the population. Much trouble, too, has been caused by the rigidand ruthless manner in which denazification has been carried out. No care seemsto have been exercised to avoid the creation of an unmanageable body ofdiscontents.41. But it would be a mistake to paint too black a picture. The americans have, in fact, succeeded in their main purpose of setting up German authoritiesand handing over to them the responsibility for administration. In this theyhave gone further than any of their partners, for the three States in the Americanzone have now Governments of their own. These are, so far, nominated bodies and, in respect of the population, have almost dictatorial powers. In due coursethey will be replaced by elected representatives.
42. As regards elections, tne Americans have been making the pace. those at the lowest level were held in January, despite German requests for delay. Theresults followed very closely the prevalent central European trend. The ChristianSocialists and non-party members took the lead. The Social Democrats came next,and the Communists were a poor third.43. The political parties in the American zone are less influenced by what happens in Berlin. Local loyalties and traditions find their extreme expressionin Bavarian separatist and monarchist movements, alleged to receive some Frenchsupport. The three main parties, however, all favour political unity.Herr Hoegner, the S.P.D. Prime Minister of Bavaria, does not take so strong an anti-fusion line as Herr Schumacher in our zone. He would accept fusion withthe Communists if there was a secret ballot. Kaiser, Chairman of the BerlinCommittee of the Christian Democratic Union, stated, after a recent visit to theUnited States and British zones, that many Christian Socialists there seemed to regard the Soviet zone and Berlin as lost to communism, and that they were adopting too reactionary a line. The Church influence in Bavaria and in SouthGermany is also an important political factor.Economic Background.44. The American zone is far less industrialised than the British. Never-theless, it contains some important industries, including the headquarters ofI.G. Farben. The breaking up of large industrial complexes is everywhere a major American objective and, after this had been consecrated by the PotsdamAgreement, the American authorities took over direct control of I.G. Farben,whose assets were vested in the Control Council.45. Industrial activity in the zone is at a low ebb, for the same reasons asimpede its restoration in the British zone. Industrial output has recently been estimated at only fifteen per cent, of the pre-war level, the same percentage as inthe British zone. Little coal is produced in the American zone, which depends on imports from the Ruhr.46. The food situation can be judged by the fact that the normal ration has just been reduced to 1,275 calories. But food off the ration is more easily obtained in the American zone, which for this reason is probably the best fed of all. Beforethe war the zone was said to be eighty per cent, self-supporting. But food produc-tion has suffered as a result of the lack of fertilisers and agricultural machinery and of the transfer from arable to pasture land. The zone, moreover, has tosupport its quota of refugees, a problem which will increase as the transfer plan is implemented. One and three-quarter million are to be transferred into the zonefrom Czechoslovakia as well as 300,000 from Hungary.Occupation Forces.47. A recent United States press report gave an estimate of 306,000 troopsin Germany and Austria in June, to be reduced to 100,000 in Germany alone bythe end of the year. The first figure would fit in with other statements made.The end of the year figure does not, however, agree with a statement made byGeneral McNarney, the United States Commander-in-Chief, who put it at 300,000.What is certain is that, all going well, large-scale withdrawals at an early dateare planned. These forces would be replaced by a specially recruited Americanmobile &quot;occupational constabulary.&quot; The location in Germany of a super-Bomber Fortress Force has also been suggested. It is probable that the UnitedStates Government have no firm plans for the length of time they will continueto maintain an army of occupation in Germany. At the start they certainlycontemplated a short occupation of about a couple of years. But lately they seemto be becoming impressed with the need to maintain their forces if they wish toexercise their proper influence in European policy. In a recent speech the assistant Secretary of State at the State Department declared that America was determined to retain enough troops in Germany to see that Germany was reducedto a predominantly agricultural State.C. The French Zone.Administration and politics.48. The French position in Germany is a difficult one. Their defeat in 1940,their small contribution to the final victory, their own internal perplexities and
their exclusion from the international conferences in which policy towards germany has been decided, have inevitably placed them in an inferior position.Their zone of occupation bears all the traces of having been an afterthought. Itwas carved out of the British and United States zones and is shaped like a figureof eight. The boundary goes through the provinces of Wurtemberg and Baden,leaving the capitals of both in the American zone. Desultory negotiations have-for some time been in progress with the Americans for its rectification. Exceptfor the Saar the zone is largely poor, agricultural territory.49. Despite their weak international position the French have madestrenuous efforts to impress upon the Germans under their control the glory andmagnanimity of France, to reconcile them to French control by offering them theco-operation of France and to attach them to the ideas of western and Frenchcivilisation. But these efforts have been prejudiced by a certain inefficiency ofadministration, a certain insecurity induced by requisitioning of food and property, and a general tendency to exploit the resources of the French zone forthe benefit of France. These derive from the natural desire of the French troops to compensate themselves and to get their own back for the long sufferingsinflicted by the Germans on France. In this there is a marked difference ofoutlook between the forces of occupation and the paternalism of military govern-ment officers.50. The headquarters of the French military government and of the forcesof occupation are located in Baden-Baden. Military government, which has beenextensively civilianised, consists of a central administration which receives itsdirectives from Paris rather than Berlin. In Paris a special control office hasbeen set up, as in London, to deal with the affairs of Germany and Austria.The zone is divided into five districts, each under a &quot; delegue superieur.&quot;Administration in the districts is based largely on the principle of indirectcontrol, and military government works through a reconstituted German civilservice. The intention is to set up German civil directorates in each district and,when these find their feet, to withdraw military government. There is no central german administration for the zone.51. The three main political parties have been authorised and the Frenchintend to start holding elections next September. Hitherto political activities,as also trade union development, seem to have been fairly rigidly restricted toa local character and the re-establishment of political contacts on an all-Germanbasis is discouraged. The French hold strongly to the conception of decent-tralisation.52. The administration of the French zone has frequently been criticised as inefficient by the Germans. But it has come under even stronger criticism from left-wing circles in France who complain that the French personnel are largely drawn from Vichy elements. There have also been some rather scathingcomments on the number of personnel employed.Economic Background.53. The French attach very great importance to the Saar which they wishto keep under permanent occupation and to incorporate in the French customs and monetary unit. They also wish for the ownership of the mines to revert toFrance. As an immediate measure they have asked that the territory should,like the areas transferred at Potsdam to Polish administration, be transferredto French administration and removed from the competence of the Allied ControlAuthority in Berlin. Meanwhile they seem to have taken energetic steps tore-activate the mines which are now producing at about fifty per cent, of thepre-war output. In 1938 annual production was running at&quot; nearly 14 million tons.54. Before the war the zone was said to be eighty per cent, self-sufficient.The food situation to-day is however very bad. The official &quot; normal consumers &quot;ration in March was 1,075 calories, but a quadripartite commission recently reported that in certain areas it was not much above 800 calories. There arespecial reasons for this in addition to those which have caused the deterioration in the British and American zones. In the first place the French occupationforces live largely off the land. Secondly, large exports were made to France,particularly in the early phase of the occupation.
Occupation Forces.55. It is believed that French occupation forces in Germany have recentlybeen drastically reduced. They are now estimated at between 60,000 and 100,000.At one time the figure was put as high as 230,000. French officers, officials and in.C.O.S are entitled to bring their wives and families with them to the french zone   This they appear to have done on a large scale.D. Soviet Zone.A dministration and politics.56. The first reports from the Soviet zone were black: famine, disease,disorder, mass removals of equipment, machinery, livestock, rails and even of people. The German population was terrified, and everything seemed to have turned out just as Dr. Goebbels had predicted. War had come home to roostwith a vengeance. Conditions in the zone during the first period, with theexception perhaps of Saxony and Thuringia, were, in fact, appalling. In Frank-further on the Oder the Soviet-installed burgomaster told members of the firstconducted press tour that 12,000 people, one-sixth of the population, had diedin the first six months from sheer hunger. This statement was later officiallyamended to 12,000 deaths by all causes. In the first flush of victory and afterthe reconquest of their own devastated areas, the Red Army were not in the moodto respect persons or property. To have held them back would probably in anycase have been impossible. But it was above all the Soviet &quot; iron curtain &quot; policywhich gave plausibility to the wildest rumours. It was felt that there must be something to hide.57. When, therefore, in January, the first carefully conducted journalistswere allowed to visit the zone, it came as a general surprise that conditions inSaxony and Thuringia, if not in Brandenburg, though far from good, were much the same as in the other zones. There were several reports of a &quot; maze ofsmoking chimney stacks,&quot; of conditions that compared very favourably with thosein the Polish administered territories over the border. There can be little doubtthat they were on the whole correct, and that behind the &quot; iron curtain,&quot; liftedon occasion to suit Russian convenience, a positive policy was being pursued.Admittedly, reorganisation was accompanied by some confusion and incon-sistencies. In their closed zone the Russians were evidently digging themselvesin. They were not merely ruthlessly eradicating a Fascist order, but also general   -getically creating a new order to put in its place, the new order being based ona single class, a single party and a controlled economic pattern.58. If the new order was to become lasting and real, it had to be built up wherever possible on convinced and indoctrinated German Communists, thoughtime-servers from other German parties could provisionally be utilised. Full usewas accordingly made of those Germans who had been trained in Moscow, andit has been claimed that some 7,500 picked ex-Wehrmacht men from the U.S.S.R.were returned to Germany for this purpose. The members of the Free GermanCommittee in Moscow were allegedly flown back to Berlin. Wide powers and privileges were at an early stage given to these Germans, though ultimate Sovietcontrol was absolute. Orders had to be followed implicity. Political discipline and obedience Avere the highest qualifications. The strength of this approach,backed as it was by intensified propaganda, land reform and appeals to nationalsentiment, lay in the fact that it gave purpose and direction to forces whichhad for long been repressed. What bad been done in &quot; Brown &quot; Avas now being done in &quot;Red.&quot;59. All Soviet actions in Germany are based on Potsdam, but, as GeneralSokolovsky, now Commander-in-Ohief, once pointed out, the really essential feature in Potsdam from his point of view is &quot; democratisation.&quot; Other problemssuch as reparation and the standard of living are by comparison relativelyunimportant. The first task was to save Germany&apos;s political soul. Once this had been thoroughly done in the Soviet zone, it could perhaps be extended tothe western zones, where social and economic disintegration would probably help to expedite the process.60. The administration of government in the zone is carried out by Germans.Strict control is exercised and the initiation of all policy rests solely with theSoviet authorities. German administrations have been set up on a &quot; Land &quot; basis.Central departments have also been in existence for some time, and the progress
towards a.zonal administration is further advanced than in our zone. TheGerman administrative personnel is nominally drawn from members of the anti-Fascist United Front (Communists, Social Democrats, Christian Socialists and liberal Democrats). Most of the key posts are in fact held by Communists.German administrators have both executive and legislative powers, but their authority is based on Soviet rather than popular support and no elections have yet been held.61. Anti-Fascist parties were set up immediately after the collapse, and later the four main parties of the United Front referred to above were allowedto develop. The idea of Berlin as the capital of Germany and the headquarters of German parties in all zones was encouraged. The traffic of ideas was, however,to be one way. Berlin views and Marxism were to be exported and dumped onthe western political market, but bourgeois democratic sentiments were not tobe imported in exchange. When elections are held it is likely that the united front will go to the poles as a single list, though the Liberal parties will perhaps be allowed to participate separately in order to create the illusion of democracyand to keep the door into the western zones open. But the Social Democratshave already been practically eliminated and forced into fusion with the Com-munists as a Socialist Unity Party. That there was no genuine and spontaneouswish for fusion can be seen from the resistance with which it has met in Berlinwhere the Social Democrats can hope for support from the Western Allies. Butin the Soviet zone itself the Social Democrats have succumbed to the mixtureof bribery and intimidation to which they have been intensively subjected.62. In addition to the political parties, the Soviet authorities make greatuse of trade unions to further their ideas. Trade union activity on a strictlySoviet model is sedulously fostered. The co-operative movement is also put touse and will no doubt be developed, as elsewhere, as a means of eliminating allopposition through the use of the ration card.63. Meanwhile propaganda to Germans is being intensified. Repeatedrumours are heard that once the Socialist Unity Party is set up Soviet occupa-tion forces will be withdrawn. There have been inspired rumours that german reporation plant will not be removed. There is also talk of a possible revisionof Germany&apos;s eastern frontier. The issue of German political unity has beenexploited to the full. The Communists (and all the Berlin parties) have spokenstrongly in favour of the Ruhr for the German worker. Separatist movementshave been attacked. Berlin Communists have also to some extent encouraged the public to compare the relative order and prosperity in the east with the chaosand famine in the west.Economic Background.64. At an early stage of their occupation the Soviet authorities carried outsweeping reforms of the banking and insurance system. The existing firms were closed down and new public institutions set up in their place. There is lessevidence that they have taken any steps to nationalise industries, though nodoubt many of the old captains of industry have been eliminated as have the largelandowners. These are said to have been deported to the island of Riigen wherethey are set to menial work. In industry there have been very extensive removalsof plant which will probably continue, but it is doubtful whether they have been on the vast scale originally imagined. There are in fact indications that recon-struction is contemplated on the lines of a planned economy to be put to the useof a Soviet five-year plan. Industrial activity in Saxony has been estimated at35 per cent, of normal. British journalists who visited Dresden were told thatsome 12,000 factories, largely producing consumer goods, were back in production.There is said to be sufficient brown coal to enable the factories to operate, coalbeing the main bottleneck both in the British and United States zones. Atan industrial exhibition in the Zeiss Ikon building in Dresden in February ofthis year, some 3,000 exhibitors were said to have been represented. The LeipzigFair is to be started again; it is significant that the order to this effect was signed by Marshal Zhukov and that business men from other zones are to beinvited to attend. Trade with the western zones is practically non-existent, buton occasion special deals have been allowed. Textiles to the value of  38,000were sent to the British zone in exchange for fifteen lorries and 600 tyres. Someexchange on a similar barter basis has taken place with&apos; the American zone.Most finished products are, however, likely to be sent east. A recent report[31751] D 2
was given over the Berlin Radio that 30,000 tons of cotton and flax had beensent from the U.S.S.R. for processing in the zone. Another report suggeststhat rails running east and west are not to be removed. It is perhaps too early to judge from such unco-ordinated pieces of information what Soviet industrial policy is or to what extent the German industrial capacity can be put to theuse of the Soviet five-year plan. But it may well be that the Soviet authoritiesare anxious to see a far more drastic de-industrialisation in western Germanythan they are themselves prepared to accept in the east. A clearer estimate oftheir policy may become possible when, as is now contemplated, liaison missionsare exchanged between the zones.65. The land reform is the most sweeping economic measure so far carriedout. It was completed quickly and ruthlessly. The immediate effect of thesplitting up of the large estates has probably led to a reduction of food output,but it was almost certainly conceived primarily as a political measure. Iteliminated the Junker class and it also provided small holdings for a consider-able number of refugees and formerly landless peasants. All the estates over100 hectares were broken up and redistributed in 5-hectare holdings. the redistribution of farm machinery, horses and cattle was obviously far moredifficult. The measure is probably, on the whole, poioular. It implies a funda-mental change in the social and economic structure of eastern Germany.Whether it will prove, or, indeed, is designed to be, lasting is another matter.The new holdings are regarded by experts as too small to be economic and the collective farm may be the final solution.66. Food rations are at present estimated at 1,580 calories in Berlin,Dresden and Leipzig, 1,260 in the larger towns, and 1,020 in the remaining areas.There is little reason to think that food conditions are better than in the westor that they will be so for some time to come. In some districts there are reportsof famine. It has, however, been said that the present ration scale will bemaintained until the new harvest. No food has yet been sent from thesenormally surplus areas to the western zones, though there have been reports ofsome going to Russia and Poland. Large quantities are also required for theRed Army, which lives off the land.Occupational forces.67. The total number of Soviet forces in Germany is not known. press reports have put the figure at 1 million. It is, however, surprising that mostreports on the zone state that Soviet troops are not much in evidence. Therehave been fairly widespread! rumours that Soviet occupation forces would be withdrawn once a Socialist Unity Party had been set up and that they wouldbe replaced by a special police force. But there are no signs that the SovietGovernment has set any limit to the period of occupation. Marshal Zhukovhas been quoted as saying &quot; We will never leave Germany.&quot;E. Berlin.The City&apos;s importance.68. Berlin politically to-day is three things : the capital of defeatedGermany, the seat of the Allied Control Council and the centre of the Sovietzone and headquarters of the Soviet Military Government.69. As the old capital Berlin has importance in the following ways: Theassociation and tradition of government remain-once a capital, always a capital.Again, all German political parties and many Germans who do not belong toparties still regard German political unity as the one thing which must be saved out of the national wreck; the suprazonal status of Berlin is, in a way,a guarantee of that unity, for the presence of four Powers in Berlin acts as aguarantee against absolute domination by any single Power.70. As the seat of the Allied Control Council and its subordinate com-mittees and directorates Berlin is the place where the four zones, as well as thefour Powers, meet. Its four sectors are British, American, Soviet and Frenchrespectively. They are the zones of Berlin. Its Control Council in miniatureis the Komendatura. It is a sort of fifth zone an international island in theSoviet zone of occupation. At Potsdam it was decided to treat Germany as aneconomic  whole and to establish  certain  German central  administrations.
Berlin is, inevitably, the place where such administrations would be set up andthe only&apos;&apos; logical centre of such an economic whole.71. As to Berlin&apos;s position as the centre of the Soviet zone and the headquarters of the Soviet occupation forces, it should be remembered that the -city was captured by Soviet troops and, on the principle that takings are keepings,it is not surprising that they should regard it as more theirs than anybody else^s.Also, while they were in sole charge they were able to do the initial cleaning up.Soviet nominees were appointed to many posts in the city administration and police. This influence remains. An island in the Soviet zone, Berlin is largely dependent on Soviet goodwill. The three western Allies are responsible for the feeding of their respective sectors, but the food, the trains, the roads, must allpass through Soviet territory. For the Soviet Element it is the home ground. Thewestern Allies are playing away.The K.P.D.-S.P.D. struggle.72. On the German internal political level the most important issue at themoment is the K.P.D.-S.P.D. fusion struggle. In its briefest outline the positionis that the Soviet authorities are anxious to see the S.P.D. and the K.P.D. mergedinto a single Socialist Unity Party at the earliest date, as they have alreadymerged in the Soviet zone itself. Such a party would essentially be dominated by its communist element and the Social Democrats would, in fact, lose both their independence and character.73. The Social Democrats in Berlin at first tried to postpone the decisionon fusion pending an all-German Social Democrat conference. Pressure was however, brought to bear on both the central executive committee and the Berlinexecutive committee with the result that the leaders of the party eventually came out in favour of fusion. They were not, however, able to carry all their partywith them in this decision with the result that the party split into anti- and pro--fusion groups. The anti-fusion, or independent, Social Democrats succeeded in organising a referendum in the three western sectors of Berlin on the31st March, and 80 per cent, of those who voted were against fusion, although62 per cent, were prepared to co-operate with the Communist Party. The soviet authorities did not allow voting to take place in their sector and subsequentlydid all they could to show that the results of the referendum were indecisive andmeaningless. Meanwhile they organised conferences both of the S.P.D. and the communists. The two parties held separate conferences on the 19th and20th April, followed by a combined conference on Easter Sunday and Monday.These conferences were regarded as Reichsparty rallies, delegates from thewestern zone being invited and elected to the central committees of both parties and also of the Socialist Unity Party. The fusion of the S.P.D. and K.P.D. inthe Soviet zone was announced on Easter Monday. At the time of writing thenew Socialist Unity Party has not yet applied to the Allied Komendatura for permission to exist in Berlin. In practice it exists in the Soviet sector, while in the western sectors it has been made known that no meetings of the new party or the opening of offices will be allowed until the Komendatura has agreed to the statutes and programme of the party. There appears to be no reasonable doubtthat the independent Social Democrat Party can maintain itself in the western sectors, but inevitably greatly increased pressure will be brought to bear on it by the Russians and the German Communists.The importance of keeping a foothold in Berlin.74. The conflict of national interests in policy^ towards Germany is reflected in miniature in the quadripartite control of Berlin. It might at first sight be argued that it would avoid friction all round if Berlin were left to the Russians,and that in remaining there we are only going out of our Avay to invite Alliedquarrels in what seems essentially a German cause. This would, however, appearto be a, shortsighted view. The importance of Berlin has already been emphasised.If our foothold were lost, eastern Germany would be completely sealed off from thewest. Such division would be purely one-sided, since the western Allies would find that they could not effectively seal off western Germany from the east just asto-day Soviet views and news are exported to the world but little world news isimported into the U.S.S.R. In addition our withdrawal from Berlin, and the lossof prestige it must involve, would go far to convince many Germans in the westthat unity and security could only be achieved by accepting communism in their turn. They would surely feel that Soviet domination in the east had come to stayand they would wonder how long the western Powers would continue to hold onin western Germany.
IV. Estimate oe Russian Intentions.75. It is perhaps a mistake to exaggerate the clearness of purpose ofRussian policy in Germany. The Soviet Government may well be as perplexedas we are ourselves. Nevertheless certain broad conclusions may safely be drawn.It is fair to assume in the first place that the Soviet Government have retainedan abiding impression of the offensive and defensive power of Germany as shownin the war. They have no wish to take any risks with Germany which, at anyrate if aided in her recovery by other Powers, could once again prove a veryformidable enemy. She must therefore be kept weak and safely contained.Equally formidable in Soviet eyes is a combination of the western democracies,of whose potential offensive power the late war bears eloquent witness. Thiscombination, strong in itself, would become still stronger if harnessed to that ofa Germany restored with western support and guidance. It also possesses, in soviet eyes, a great power of political attraction for Germany. If, relying ontheir material power and moral influence, the western Powers could see their way to draw western Germany into their orbit, the Soviet Government would think it natural that they should proceed to do so; and they are keenly on thewatch for signs of such a development.76. There may be said therefore to be three main elements present in soviet policy towards Germany : (a) preventing at all costs the revival of a strong and independent Germany;(b) preventing western Germany with the Ruhr, or even the Ruhr alone,being brought into any close grouping of the western democracies; and(c) ensuring that Germany eventually looks east and remains under strong,.and if possible exclusive, Russian influence.Meanwhile, the Soviet Government are faced with the problem of pursuingtheir aims in, at any rate outward, association with a group of Powers for whosematerial resources they have a healthy respect and for whose ulterior intentionsthey have a deep mistrust.77. The manner in which they have used the Potsdam Agreement as an aid to their policy is worthy of note and, indeed, of respect. So far as the destructivemeasures prescribed at Potsdam are concerned they have insistently stood out forthe strictest application and interpretation of the relevant clauses e.g., those relating to disarmament, demilitarisation, denazification, destruction and restric-tion of war potential, reparations, the scaling-down of Germany&apos;s peace-timelevel of industry and standard of living. On the other hand, they have been lessinterested in those positive or constructive provisions of the Potsdam agreement which call for four-Power action. Germany is not yet treated as an economicwhole. Interzonal trade is of negligible volume. There is no pooling of food andother resources. The Russians appear to be maintaining that in present circum-stances imports and exports shall be balanced on a zonal basis. In their own zonethey carry out their own political and economic policy behind an iron curtain,which has as yet been lifted only to carefully conducted visitors. This policy hasa constructive as well as a repressive aspect. On the repressive side they areeliminating the bourgeois classes as part of the process of denazification and land reform. But a worker, even if formerly an active member of the Nazi party,may be admitted into the ruling communist fold. On this class basis they areevidently seeking to propitiate the population, by letting the Germans in large measure conduct their own affairs and even encouraging them to beat thenationalist drum. On the economic side they are reactivating German lightindustries for the production of consumer goods, and they may before long beable to justify their claim that material conditions in their own zone are betterthan elsewhere in Germany.78. These developments prompt the question, do the Soviet government desire to see a unitary Germany administered from Berlin as foreshadowed atPotsdam ? Or do they wish to perpetuate the zonal system of administration ?Some of their acts and expressions of view speak in favour of the first hypothesis,and some in favour of the second. The truth probably is that they have not yetmade up their minds; that they are at present hedging, as the French delegationconveniently enables them to do by blocking the establishment of central Germanadministrations; and that meanwhile they are making the best of both worlds,establishing themselves securely in their own zone, to which they will add Berlinif they can, while at the same time asserting and maintaining to the maximum
degree their interest in, and right of access to, the western zones and their demand for the integral application throughout Germany of those provisions ofPotsdam which suit them.79. They are unlikely to be in any hurry to modify this situation of their -own accord, more particularly as both the unitary Germany and the zonal -Germany have possible disadvantages from their point of view. They may also&quot;wish to avoid any fundamental decisions until after the French elections and.perhaps until they can estimate the prospects of the Socialist Unity Partycatching on in western Germany or, alternatively, of the western democraciessuccessfully organising a reasonably prosperous existence in the western zones.They are probably less certain than some western thinkers that a unitary Germanygoverned from Berlin would necessarily be under decisive Soviet influence. Evena Communist Germany would be unlikely to forget or forgive the amputation ofthe eastern provinces, for all the efforts the Russians could use to divert itshostility towards the west; nor are the traditions and doctrines of Russian andGerman communism identical. On the other hand they may well see gravedangers in the zonal solution, lest it result in the permanent establishment of western and capitalist influence in the western zones, the incorporation of western Germany in the western bloc, and the integration of a revived german industry in the western economic system. An acute observer in Berlin recentlysummed up his view of Russian intentions as follows. The developments ofthe past few weeks had now convinced him that the Soviet authorities had no intention of permitting effective four-Power control over the affairs of theirzone. They might conform to certain formal four-Power rules, but they would run their zone politically and economically as a matter of their own exclusiveconcern. They would not allow it to be effectively treated as part of a german economic whole. On the other band they would no doubt be anxious for Germanyto be treated as a unit for purposes of political activity, since this would promote the spread of the new Socialist Unity Party throughout Germany. Their hopewas, from a secure and inviolable base in their own zone, to extend their influencewestwards. Only when Germany was unified politically in the way they wishedwould they allow Germany to be unified economically and by that time theywould think that Germany should be run by Germans and not by the Allies.80. Of one thing we may be sure. They will not rest content with organisingtheir own zone. Already they are actively supporting the Communists in thewestern zones and, as soon as they feel their organisation sufficiently complete,they may be counted on to launch out on a more forward policy in the west.Herr Grotewohl, the Social Democrat leader in Berlin, who has espoused thecause of fusion with the Communists, put the matter in a nutshell in a speechcelebrating the decision of the party conference in favour of fusion. &quot; The newparty &quot; he said &quot; will not halt at the Elbe.&quot;24Jh April, 1946.
