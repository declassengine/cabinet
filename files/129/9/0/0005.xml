ANNEXA meeting was held in the Ministry of Transport on the13th April, under the chairmanship of Sir Cyril Hurcomb,  inaccordance with the decision of the Defence Committee onFriday, 12th April, and at which the Service and civiliandepartments concerned wore represented.(i) The proposed programme for civilian movement as setout in paragraph 8 of CP. (46) 151 was considered.iVhilst not satisfying all priority civilianrequirements, it was agreed that it would enableessential minimum services to be maintained. .   Itwas also recognised that the only way of effectingmajor improvement in the civilian passenger lift isby reconverting troopships to their normal condition as passenger ships.      The loss in civilian passengerlift during the period of reconversion would be smallwhile the gain to the civilian programme on thecompletion of conversion would be considerable.(ii)While    there is no appreciable scope for the immediatechartering of ships under foreign flags, apart fromthose allowed for in the present estimates,negotiations will be pressed forward with a view to obtaining increased assistance from American andother sources later in the summer.(iii) The plans for civilian movement and the release ofshipping depend largely upon a decision to reduce thetroop lift available to SACSEA, thus delaying thecompletion of the rearrangement of Forces in his area by about two months.      The full reduction of lift from41,000 to 30,000 need riot take effect in May;    morethan half the full drop of 11,000 could be deferred until June even if &quot;ORION&quot; is released immediately.(iv) Subject to acceptance of the delay in completing the movements in the SEAC area, the meeting agreed torecommend the immediate release of &quot;ORION&quot;.(v) The meeting further agreed that the tentative provisionfor civilian movement proposed in paragraph 8 of cp.(46)  151 should be accepted, as amended below:500 per month to and from West Africa900/1,000 &quot;        &quot; &quot;        &quot;    South and East Africa500 per month    &quot; &quot;       &quot;    Middle East and Soudan1,500   &quot;       &quot;       &quot; &quot;       &quot; &apos;India1,000    &quot;       &quot;       &quot; &quot;       &quot;    Australia and New zealand in   addition, berths will be available in commercialsailings to these and other destinations.C v i&quot;) Theshouldins at
