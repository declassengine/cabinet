THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.  May 1946.SECRET. Copy N0.3CP. (46) 195.10t  May, 1946.CABINET.LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT FOR V.I.P&apos;s.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Air, the Minister of Supplyand the Minister of Civil Aviation.THE Prime Minister has asked that we should inform our colleagues of theresources now available for long-range air transport of Cabinet Ministers andother front-rank V.I.P.&apos;s (very important persons).Royal Air Force Facilities.2. The Royal Air Force has had for some time at Northolt a small flightof long-range aircraft prepared to a higher degree of comfort than the normalRoyal Air Force standard. Until a few months ago it comprised three Yorksand two Skymasters, each with its own crew. One of the Yorks, L.V. 633,was specially prepared to a standard laid down by Mr. Churchill and wasnormally reserved for his use.3. The Americans have, however, exercised their right to call for the return of the Skymasters, which had been supplied under Lend/Lease, and the establish-ment of the Flight has now been altered to four Yorks and four Lancastrians.At least one of each type will be constantly standing by for duty, while theother crews and aircraft are exercised along the trunk routes and on other important flights. This will mean that a particular V.I.P. will not always be flown by the same crew, but the change has the advantage of keeping the specialcrews in more regular flying practice. This is considered to be of some importance as a safety factor.4. Details of the Yorks are given in Appendix &quot;A.&quot; It will be seen that until M.W. 100 and M.W. 101 are modified, there is not a V.I.P. York capableof flying the Atlantic. The two modified very long-range Yorks should, however,be in service later this month (May 1946). The Lancastrians are not suitablefor the transport of V.I.P.&apos;s themselves, owing to the narrowness of the fuselage,which prevents really comfortable seating being arranged; but they could, forexample, take clerks, typists, office equipment and luggage, accompanying a minister to a Conference in North America or elsewhere&apos;.5. These are the best arrangements which we can make now. As is wellknown, we have largely relied on the United States for transport aircraft duringthe war, while we concentrated on combat types. Current British transporttypes are all adaptations or conversions of military aircraft. Two Tudor I&apos;swill, however, be converted for V.I.P. travel, possibly about the end of this year.The Tudor I was designed to carry 12 passengers and 1,840 lbs. of freight acrossthe Atlantic, and it should be able to carry a V.I.P. plus at least 8 staff inthe very highest degree of comfort by day or night.6. At Appendix &quot; B &quot; is a table giving the estimated frequency of usabilityat British terminal airfields for flights from the British Isles to Gander in newfoundland. It will be seen that, in the winter, a passenger intending to cross the Atlantic will reduce the risk of weather delays to a minimum if he isprepared to take off from Prestwiok.[31817]
Ministry of Civil Aviation Facilities.7: Civil Aviation has at present no special facilities for the long-rangeair transport of Cabinet Ministers. In the past occasional special flights weremade by the Boeing 314A flying boats, but these aircraft have been withdrawnfrom the trans-Atlantic service and are no longer available for such purposes.Special flights can occasionally be arranged on Hythe flying boats. These arecivil conversions of the Sunderland and are very suitable for carriage of V.I.P.&apos;s.But these aircraft are not capable of flying the Atlantic and are only suitablefor operation on the Empire routes. Furthermore, their use for special flightsmight involve the interruption of regular services. The B.O.A.C. have, in addi-tion, one very well-furnished Dakota which is suitable for use on medium-stageroutes.Future Arrangements.8. It is agreed in principle between the Air Ministry and the Ministry ofCivil Aviation that the latter should assume general responsibility for the long-range transport of Cabinet Ministers as soon as this is physically practicable.To this end, the possibility is being examined of the allotment under suitablefinancial arrangements of the two Tudor I aircraft referred to above, whenavailable, to B.O.A.C. for the special purpose of long-range transport of cabinet ministers.9. There would still be occasions when the Royal Air Force would beexpected to carry V.I.P.&apos;s; for example, they would normally take officers of thefighting Services, and Ministers visiting Service units. If the Tudor I aircraft are transferred to the Ministry of Civil Aviation these journeys will have to bemade in Yorks or Lancastrians.J. w.w.10th May, 1946.APPENDIX &quot;A.&quot;YORKS IN ROYAL AIR FORCE V.I.P. FLIGHT.L.V. 633.This is the &quot; Prime Ministers &quot; York, which was prepared to the require-ments of Mr. Churchill. It has a cabin at the back and a conference room. Inaddition, it has seats for 12 and beds for 5. The long-range tank is not fitted inthis aircraft, and it cannot cross the Atlantic.M.W. 128.This is the ordinary Service version of the York, with passenger fittings. Ithas seats for 24 and no sleeping accommodation. It has not sufficient range forthe Atlantic crossing.M. W. 100.This aircraft has permanent accommodation to seat 8 passengers which canbe readily converted in flight to sleeping accommodation. This includes a privatecabin for two, sitting or sleeping, with a tip-up seat for use, as required, by astenographer who would normally be seated outside the private cabin. Fittingsto enable an additional seat (not convertible to a bunk) to be installed if requiredhave also been provided.A long-range tank has been installed, but on such flights as Prestwick toGander it will be necessary to reduce the number of passengers in order to avoidexceeding the maximum permissible gross weight. The extent to which it willbe necessary to reduce the number of passengers is dependent on the amount of reserve fuel considered necessary on individual flights.The aircraft has been prepared to the highest degree of comfort possilbe within the limited time allowed for the conversion. It is now undergoing certainelectrical and radar modifications at Hamble and these should be completed andthe aircraft ready for the Prime Minister by the end of May.
M.W. 101.A long-range tank is being installed in this aircraft but it will retain normalV.I.P. furnishings and will not be prepared to such a high standard of comfortas M.W. 100. It will have seats for 11 passengers but no sleeping accommodation.Like M.W. 100, the number of passengers carried on the Atlantic route islikely to be limited. It is expected to be ready to hand over to transport command towards the end of May.In short, two of the four Yorks have been prepared to a high degree ofcomfort, one of which is capable of long-range work. The other two have beenprepared to the V.I.P. and normal passenger standards of comfort respectively,and the former will be capable of undertaking long-range flights.PROBABLE PERCENTAGE FREQUENCY OF USABILITY at prestwick, NORTHOLT AND HEATHROW AS TERMINALSFOR FLIGHTS FROM THE BRITISH ISLES TO GANDER.Summary.APPENDIXB.Summer.Winter.PrestwickNortholtHeathrowTudor.Per cent99York.Per cent99Tudor.Per cent.85i39York.Per cent.88i47
