DRAFTIRON AND STEEL1.     This paper briefly summarises the considerations which led the Government to their decision, announcod in the Houseof Commons on the 17th April, 19^6, by the Minister of Supply,that the position of the iron and steel industry and its importance in the national economy necessitated a large measureof public ownership and that, pending the passing of thenecessary legislation, a National Control Board should be setup for the industry,2,      In the period between the wars there.were a number of reports on the position and future of the iron and steelindustry.      In the later stages of the war the coalition government invited the industry to furnish its views on the post-war problems and prospects of the industry, and preliminary reports were received from the British Iron and Steel Federation and theCouncil of Iron Foundry Associations, together with a Report fromthe Iron and Steel Trades Confcoloration,  the principal TradeUnion concerned.      In May, 19I4.5, -&apos;. following on a review made bythat Government of the position in the light of these reports, theBritish Iron and Steel Federation was requested to prepare a planembodying the major improvements.arid new &quot;construction necessaryto put the industry on an efficient operating basis.     A similarrequest was made in Juno, 191+5, to the Joint Iron Council inrespect of the sections of the industry which it covered, vis.the production of foundry pig iron and iron founding.     Thereports by the British Iron and Steel Federation and the JointIron Council to the Minister of Supply are reproduced as Annex Iand Annox II, respectively-, to this paper.3,      The term &quot;iron and steel industry&quot; is generally usedto describe the operations involved in converting iron ore orscrap into iron or steel shapes used by other industries.      Thefollowing arc the very broad divisions: -(a) Mining ore.(b) Production in&apos; blast furnaces, from ore and coke ofthe different types and oualitics of pig ironrequired by the steel industry, and the iron foundryand wrought iron industries.(c) Production from pig- iron and/or scrap of steel ingotsfor farther manipulation as in (d) below and of steelcastings for engineering industries,(d) The manipulation of steel ingots ; through diffcrontstages into shapes by rolling into plates, sheets,strip, rails, sections, bars, rods, by drawing intotubes and by forging into wheels, axles, engineeringparts, etc.(e) Production from pig iron and scrap of - iron, -oafltingsfor engineering and building industries and heavypipes.&quot;]      Many engineering and other works have theirown foundries.(f) Production from pig iron and scrap of wrought ironand its manipulation into bars, etc.(g) Production of alloy &quot;teclR^hlg^speed and tool steels.These arc special steels.    Special pig iron and scrapis used and alloyed with nickel, chrome, molybodnum,

tungscen, vanadium, etc. Ingots arc -produced in small fiirnaccsj many electrical, and then cast,forged or rolled into special shapes.On the basis of the figures for the first quarter of 19h7,the industry in these operations is using some 12^ million tons01. homo-proem cod iron ore, 5 million tons of imported ore, andfz million -cons of iron and steel scrap per annum in theproduction of 7:,: million tons of pig iron (of which some5-r million tons arc used in steel making) and over 12-g- million ingot tons of steel per annum.h.      The operations of individual companies vary greatly,in general, heavy steel products such&apos; as plates, rails,  joistssections and tubes arc produced in continuous operations at oneworks,  starting from iron ore and scrap.     While most of the heavysteel makers also produce light sections and bars, there arc about100 independent rc-rollers who only roil billets and sheet barsinto the final required shapes.      In the case of wire, about half the production is by 8 firms which produce the wire rods; .but there arc about 30 independendont wirc-clrawers who purchasetheir rods,      iron and steel castings and forgings are producednot only by iron and stool making firms and independent&quot;&quot;foundries,but by engineering and other firms.A number of steel making firms make finished products,such as bolts? nuts, screws, rivets, washers, wire goods,springs, etc.      The activities of many extend either direct or through associated companies to various forms of engineering.Some engage   in   s t ru ct u r al        engineering both at home andabroad.      In addition, based on by-products,  some firms haveextensive interests in the chemical and allied industries.5.      In announcing In the House of Commons on the 1 9*&amp;&amp; November, 19^5,the Government&apos;4 plans for the  socialisation of industries,the Lord President of the Council stated that the government proposed to await the reports from the industry before reaching a final.docision on future organisation.     Following the receiptof the Report s; and- a thorough examination of their contents, theGovernment considered it desirable to announce with the least possible delay their broad decision on the future of the industry.The Government has given the most, careful, consideration to thepossible alternatives;    and in doing so their main objective- hasbeen to secure, with the minimum of delay, the thorough modern!sa-tion of plant and technique.,   and rationalisation of production,which is necessary if the industry is to meet the nationsrequirements for iron and. steel in tho future.6.      The British Iron and Stool Federation plan which contemplatesthe expenditure on tho steel industry over the next 5 to 7 yearsof some  168,000,000 represents a major step towards meeting theheavy arrears of modernisation and development which arise largely from the cessation of normal development during the war years.Continuing and heavy capital expenditure wall bo needed in lateryoars if the industry is to attain and maintain the highest possible level of efficiency as a supplier to the consumingihdustruos and an important contributor to the export trade.The plan as set out in the Federation&apos;s Report (Annex I) Involves,in addition to much modernisation of existing plant, thoscrapping of almost 3 million tons of steel making pig ironcapacity and k million ingot tons of steel molting and rollingcapacity now existing,  and its replacement by new capacity forsoras 44 million tons of stool-making pig iron and almost6 million ingot tons of stool.     The result will bo to increase this- country1 s capacity to over 9 million tons of stcol-making

typo pig-iron and 16 million ingot tons of stool.     TheGovernment have been informed that a comparable plan, which atsome points will need to be closely articulated with theFederation s plan for steel-making pig iron, is being preparedpy tno Council of Iron Producers for tho Foundry Pig IronIndustry.     The Steel Federation plan is in the Government1sview, suitably designed to meet the outstanding technicalneeds of the industry;      and tho Government propose to utilise it-the basis of the reconstruction of the industry.      It wmaldabsorb for 5 to 7 years   the full capacity of the specialisedplant and building industries.7.  j  The Government have therefore  considered which policy wasbosv calculated to ensure over the years to come the broadfulfilment of this plan; the continued development necessarythereafter, and the operation of the industry to the best nationaladvantage.The formation in 1934, with the support of the thenGovernment, of the British Iron and Steel Federation, and itssubsoquant development, has already taken the industry beyond the stage of individual and independent units of private enterprise and has created a strong centralised Trado Association exorcisinga dominating influence on the policy and price structure of theindustry.     It has had a large voice in moulding the individual firms plans to fit into the general framework and the plan assumes that modernisation must proceed under the direction of a centralauthority.      The report of the Federation assumes that it willitself carry out these central- functions, including the fixing of uniform prices.      The Federation have now had twelve yearsexperience of some measure of Government supervision and control,and make their proposals on the assumption that this supervisionwill continue.     The Government accept the view that it is impracticable to return to the unregulated competition of individual units.      The only practicable alternative to some form of public ownership is therefore to continue the pro-war policy of Government supervision through a strong central trade association and to leave the ownership in the hands of a largonumber of separate companies.     Under this arrangement theAssociation in liaison with the Government would supervisetho price structure and production policy of the various  sectionsof the industry, and seek to influence capital development and advice on the regulation of imports.8.      The success of such a policy would depend on the continued co-operation of the industry&apos;s central trade association and the willingness of the individual firms to operate in accordance-with its guidance.      In the Government&apos;s view this cannot betaken for granted.      It implies an unsatisfactory division betweenpower and responsibility?    and would place the leaders of theindustry in an invidious position, with responsibility to theGovernment on tho one hand and to their shareholders on the other.These responsibilities might well conflict.      It is clear chatin tho period ahead tho Government will have to concern itselfoven&quot; more closely than in the past with the policy and operationof a basic industry such as stool, which occupies a key positionin the nation&apos;s economic life, and this form of organisation would be likely to result in division and possibly conflict.At the same time the Federation, in their report, contemplate the raising of something like  80,000,000 from outside sourcesas well as priorities for labour and material on a large scale.      This can only bo secured in present conditions if theGovernment grant the necessary facilities and priorities.      ihe

Government considers that io all these  circumstances it would&quot;&quot;?not be  justified in leaving the direction of the development ofthe industry so largely in the hands of the trade association.The conclusion -has accordingly been reached that only by intro-ctucing a large measure of public ownership is it possible for theplan of modernisation to be carried out or the long-term development of the industry in the public interest to be assured,9v      The iron and Steel Industry is,  as is clear from paragraph 3and L above, not one industry but a complex group of related andInterlocking industries, and the exact ^boundaries of the field tobe taken into public ownership can only be defined after expertdetailed study of the points of difficulty and-the problems ofseverance presented by the large integrated firms.    Such a studycould not be undertaken until,broad decisions on policy had beenreached.      An interval must ejfcapse before - the necessary legislationcan be prepared and passed.      In the interval it will be essentialto press on speedily with the execution of urgent capital davelcp;-ment schemes.     At the same time the iron and steel supply position may well become temporarily more difficult in the near future and will necessitate Government control of production anddi stribution,10.      It Is therefore proposed in the interval before transfer to public ownership to establish, a Control Board:      This Board will replace the existing Iron and Steel Control and Will be responsible to the Minister of Supply for continuing, under the existing powers of the Minister^ the present functions of the control in the supervision and direction of the production of the industryjthe allocation of supplies within it * and advising on prices.The Board will pay special attention in consultation with theindustry to facilitating the early execution of urgent develop-ment schemes.     It is also proposed that the Board shall aptas adviser to the Minister of Supply on questions arising inthe preparation of the scheme of nationalisation.-11.      The Ministry of Supply has been approving the necessaryconstructional work and purchase of plant for those firms in theindustry where It could be -shown that it was necessary toproceed with development, either for maintenance purposes or for improving production efficiency.     Since the beginning of 19^5?approval has been given to schemes involving the expenditureof about  181: million for the steel industry and about  3i million for foundries, and these  schemes are now proceeding..     A furthernumber of the major schemes has now reached an advanced stage of preparation and it is hoped that work will be startedwithout a.elay.
