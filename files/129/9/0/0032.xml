(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT)S-E-C-R-E-TCP, (U6)182      - COPY NO t)^___30th APRIL, 19U6CABINETUNITED KINGDOM WHEAT AND PLOUR position memorandum by the Minister of Pood1.      The attached statement, which has been agreed with theDepartments concerned, sets out the latest estimate of thewheat and. flour position of the United Kingdom during theperiod to end of September, 19k6.2.      Taking the most optimistic estimate of the supply-position , the enob-Soptembor stocks would be -Wheat - 620,000 tonsPlour   - 305,000 tonsTaking the more pessimistic estimate the end-September stockswould bo -Wheat    - minus 1 6,000 tonsPlour   - 255,000 tons.      Even on the most optimistic assumption there would be a shortfall  of 155,000 tons of wheat as compared with the reduced stock level of 77.5,000 tons, or a&apos; shortfall of280,000 tons as compared, with the higher stock figure of900,000 tons which the Cabinet decided must be restored assoon as possib1e.h.      It is clear&quot;that even on the most optimistic assumptionsfurther economies must be made in wheat  consumption in theUnited Kingdom.      I propose that the following measures ^shouldbe taken as soon as possible:-(a) Increase the extraction rate to ?0yj, which would save 25,000 tons of wheat a month or an additional100,000 tons by the end of September.(b) reduce the&apos; current production of biscuits and similarproducts by approisinately ?5/.i.      This will save6,000 tons of wheat a month or approximately25,000 tons by the end of September.(c) reduce the allocation of fat and sugar for themanufacture of cako and flour confectionary by 12-^.This will not. result -in an automatic saving of 12-5&apos;/Of flour, but it would involve some reduction inflour consumption.5.      Apart from the savings in wheat resulting from thereduction in cakes and flour confectionery, those economicswould togother save 125,000 tons of wheat by the end ofSeptember, bringing the stock figure, on the most optimisticassumptions to 745.000 tons of wheat.      This (togother withsome saving from cakes) would not be far short of the minimum

figure of 775*000 tons.      On the more pessimisticassumptions the stock figure would bo not much in excess of109,000 tons of wheat.      These measures will result in areduction in supplies of feeding stuffs for animals.6.&apos;    It will be obvious  that the above economics will notmoot the situation unless our most optimistic expectationsare fulfilled.      A flat cut in flour issues would, unlessaccompanied by a rationing scheme, lead to queues andpossibly hunger duo., to iooquitablo distribution.-   -Theonly means of ensuring equity would bo a comprehensiverationing scheme for bread, floury oatmeal,  cakes and flourconfectionery.      Such a scheme could, not come into operationbefore 21st July.      The savings it would provide would dependon the stringency of the scheme, which could be adjusted to the needs of the situation.     I am proceeding with allpreparations f^r such a scheme but it is not necessary to recruit staff or print books for such a purpose at tho&apos;moment, and before deciding on the necessity for such ascheme, I would of course submit further proposals to mycolleagues.7.      In the absence of a stringent rationing scheme, our only hope of remedying our prospective position,  should.thc most optimistic assumptions not be realised, lies inobtaining increased supplies of wheat from Canada and theUnited States.      Canada has promised to do everything in herpower to send to the United kingdom.om all the wheat she canextract from farmers.      So far as the United States isconcerned it is a question of our persuading theAdmiini strati on that we arc introducing all reasonableeconomics and that they must accept the responsibility ofmaintaining the reduced, standard of consumption which will result from tho economics we arc introducing.     Some small quantities may be obtained from the Argentine, but the claims of other countx-ies arc so great and. the Argentine positionso uncertain that it would be unsafe to placo reliance on further substantial supplies from Argentine.8.      The throe economies which I suggest will be valuable indemonstrating to the United States that we arc taking all reasonable measures to help ourselves before applying to theUnited States for assistance.9. I therefore ask for authority to introduce tho followingeconomies as soon as possible:Increase the extraction rate to 90&apos;/Reduce the output of biscuits and similarproducts by 257&apos;(c) Reduce the allocation of fat and sugar for  ohomanufacture of cakes and flour confectionery by12-V/*, in the expectation of making some -reduction in tho consumption    of flour for calces.10       It will be possible to review the position again inthroe or four wooks time In tho light of tho supply po srtxonand. then decide what further conservation measures arcnecess.ary..(intl&apos;d&apos;d)   B.S.Ministry of Pood, W*1.30th April, 19^-6.

The above figures assume that the &quot;diversions&quot; of 200,000 tonsof wheat is mad.e in April-June, and that replacement by theUnited. States occurs in July.      If the United States fails torepla.ee by any amount, the encl -September stock would be that amount less,2,      The above figures &apos;assume that the United States will notbe able to fulfil the promise to underwrite any failure of canadian supplies in July to the extent of 316,000 tons.     Thesupply of this quantity in July, plus repayment of the200,000 tons loan would mean that the United States would haveto ship to the United Kingdom 516,000 tons out of a total export programme of 1,000,000 or 1,200,000 tons.3.      The figure of home production for August and. Septembergiven above is the more conservative one put forward by theMinistry of Pood.      An alternative estimate,- agreed both by theMinistry of Pood and the Ministry of Agriculture to be ratheroptimistic, would, secure an additional 120,000 tons in the twomonths, increasing the end.-September stock by that .amount.1+.      The saving of flour from the smaller loaf, which may amountto 50,000 tons by end-September, is not included, in theabove figures, and. if realised would increase the end--Septemberstock by that amount.,

5.      Therefore (i)  taking the most optimistic estimateof each of the above four uncertain factors, the end-September stocks would be:Wheat PIoUT620,000 tons 305,000 tonsand (ii) taking the pessimistic estimate, the end-Septemberstocks would be: -minus -16,000 tons 255,000 tons.
