12TH APRIL.   1QU6CABINETNote by the Additional secretarvBy direction of the Prime Minister, I circulate the attached Washington Telegram No- 2338 of the 11th Aprilwhich will be discussed at the Cabinet to be held to-day,12th Anril at 6 rum.(Signer.)    NORMAN BROOK.Cabinet Office,  S.W.   1.,12th April,  1946.ANNEXPRIME MINISTER&apos;personal TELEGRAMSERIAL NO.  T.127/46PROM, WASHINGTON TO FOREIGN OPFICEEarl of HalifaxNo.  25J811th Arril.  IQ46IMMEDIATEPERSONALFor the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of Food from Lord Halifax-La Guardia is coming to see me to-morrow.  .   I hearhe intends to say two things.      First, can the United Kingdommake an immediate contribution to meet U.N.R.R.A.&apos;s pressingneed for cereals in April provided adequate assurances are(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY1 a GOVERNMENT,-SECRETCiPjJ.k6J._15k COPY NO .

received regarding future supplies..  . Secondly,  that if the combined Food Board at its meeting on Monday,  15th April,does not r ive &quot;aim additional supplies, he will at oncereconvene U.N.S.R.A. Council and announce that in his opinionU.N.R.R.A.. has failed in its tash and cannot usefully continueto function..2. What weight should be attached to the second pointI am not sure,  but I have little doubt that at the combined food Board meeting the United Kingdom ^SrP- unclec. ? willy7come under heavy and renewed pressure not only from La Guardiawhich is perhaps not too important,  but also from UnitedStates representatives.      If we did not have to rely on theUnited States of America as regards wheat supplies for the months up to August and September perhaps this would not matte-very much either.     But as I understand the position we orebound to depend upon American supplies, at least for theBritish zone in Germany.      There is also the Indian questionhanging over us,  end I hear that the Canadians now seriouslydoubt whether they can continue to deliver to the UnitedKingdom each month up to September at the rate at which theyare presently making deliveries,  end which covers the UnitedKingdom1s pre sent need s,3. I think I realise how all this must look from yourend, but if we have to depend on getting supplies of wheatout of the United Stares of America in the months to come,  itmust be of prime importance to do whatever we can to extractfrom the Americans the most binding pledge that they will,in fact,  deliver to us what we need from them.      Further,   thebest way of securing such a pledge is to make with the leastdelay the maximum immediate contribution which we can byreadiness to use our stocks to help the immediate needs,not only of the U.N.R. R./.. countries, but of other areas for which we have responsibilities.     I know all the risk that this course may be held to involve, but in my judgment .it is a matter on which a bold decision reinsured by t he-undertakings that such a decision should enable us to get outof the Americans, will pay us best.4- I am sending this personal message because Ibelieve we have reached a crucial point.      The offer aboutrationing was a helpful gesture, and has temporarily givenus advantage of initiative.     But if we find ourselves unableto follow it up with a concrete contribution, I  think we are .likely to be involved in troubles much wider than any arisingfrom the immediate question of giving assistance to U.N.R.R.A.
