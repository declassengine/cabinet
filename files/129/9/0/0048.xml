C. E.Home Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1,18th May, 1946.SECRET. Copy No.    3gCP. (46) 198.18th May, 1946.CABINET.Prime Minister,I have the honour to report that, on the invitation of the authorities of theChannel Islands, I visited Jersey, Guernsey and Alderney in connection withtheir celebrations of the first anniversary of their liberation from the german occupation. I arrived in Jersey early on the morning of the 9th May. TheParliamentary Under-Secreiafy, Mr. George H. Oliver, M.P., arrived inGuernsey on the evening of that day. Throughout our stay we were accompaniedby Sir Frank Newsam, Deputy Under-Secretary. After participating in theThanksgiving Service in Jersey On the morning of the 9th, I flew to Guernseyon the afternoon of that day, visited Alderney on the afternoon of the 10th,returned to Jersey on the afternoon of the. 11th and flew back to Croydon on the afternoon of Monday, the 13th. A very full programme had been arranged forus and with the exception of a visit to Sark, which we were prevented fromcarrying out by rough weather, all our engagements were fulfilled.Jersey.2. With the Lieutenant-Governor, i attended a great Thanksgiving Serviceheld in the People&apos;s Park. This large open space and the streets of the town weregaily decorated with flags, All kinds of vehicles had brought the inhabitantsfrom the remotest parts of the Island, and there was a most impressive, paradeof ex-Servicemen. I have never before seen so fine a display of medals. One manhad; fought in the Zulu War of 1879, and1 Others carried&apos; distinctions won in earlier Indian Frontier Wars;- waged before I was born. The schoolchildren alisotook part in the parade and sang to the tune of &quot; Marching through Georgia &quot; aspecial song which had been composed by one of the teachers in ebhimembrationof the liberation. . The Very Reverend the Dean of Jersey, assisted by the localNbh-Cohformist ministers, conducted a short and impressive Service; the lieutenant-Governor and I then addressed the crowd. The King&apos;s gracious-replyto the loyal address from, the States,and people which I read was loudly cheered.Wewere followed by a Colonel of the United States Army, who bestowed&apos; UnitedStates decorations.on two Jerseymen who had been prominent&apos; in rescuingAmerican airmen shot down in the sea near the Island.[31849]
3. On our return to Jersey on the Saturday, I attended, with the Under-Secretary, a meeting of the trade unionists in the Island. We were received withgreat enthusiasm. Their interest in the doings of the Labour Government inEngland is very high. Their appreciation of our difficulties shows that theyfollow our activities with the keenest interest and approval.4. We next attended a gathering of the teachers of the Island held. i&apos;hVictoria College, a public school which has produced many famous lawyers,,including the present Lord du Parcq, sailors and soldiers. I explained the recentalterations of the education service in England and commended our example to both administrators and practitioners.5. We next visited the prison, the administration of which is one of theweak spots in the Island&apos;s government. One of our Assistant Prison Commis-sioners has recently visited the building and has made recommendations for reform.6. In the evening we were entertained to dinner by the States. Gratitudewas expressed in the liveliest terms for the recent financial assistance which HisMajesty&apos;s Government have afforded to the Island. In my reply I announced the decision of the Privy Council to appoint a Committee to enquire into theproposed constitutional and judicial changes in the Island recently submitted tous. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary made a most impressive speech on theRights of the Common Man.7. On Sunday morning a United Non-Conformist Service was held in theprincipal Methodist Church which was filled to overflowing. A special hymnwhich had been written during the occupation by the Senior Methodist Ministerand set to music by his organist was sung. The author, the organist and theprinter were threatened with imprisonment by the Germans when this hymn was first used in the Island. I delivered a short address, and with the Under-Secre-tary received the principal Non-Conformists of the Island after the Service.8. In the afternoon the Lieutenant-Governor and the Bailiff conducted uson a tour of the Island, during which we were shown an enormous undergroundhospital which the Germans had constructed with Russian labour. Whenliberation came, it was equipped for 450 patients and accommodation for themedical and nursing staff capable of dealing with so large a number of patients.The number of man-hours spent on its construction must have been enormous.It is air-conditioned, has a water carriage system of sanitation, electric light. Theexpense of constructing and equipping it staggers one.9. On Sunday evening we attended a special service which had beenarranged in the principal Roman Catholic Church on the Island. This was attended by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Portsmouth and an address was givenby the Apostolic Delegate.  Again a very large congregation attended.10. On Monday morning a special sitting of the States was held at whicha resolution of thanks to myself and the Under-Secretary was proposed, secondedand adopted in the most friendly fashion. I replied, as did also the Under-Secretary. Our exhortations to this ancient assembly to encourage the people to face their economic difficulties with courage and resource were warmly applauded.The speeches at this meeting were relayed to the public outside. I subsequentlyaddressed the populace from the balcony of the Island&apos;s political club. i--.111. During the German occupation the Colorado Beetle was introduced toJersey. The prevalence of this pest is at the moment hampering the economic recovery of the Island, as no vegetable produce may be sent from it to any other of the Islands or to Great Britain. With the assistance of the Ministry ofAgriculture, energetic steps are being taken to rid the Island of this unwelcomereminder of German rule. ......12. The tourist industry is capable of dealing this year.with all the people who are likely to.be able to secure passages by sea or air.&quot;13. As. compared with the south of England, the Island did not suffer agreat amount of destruction, although some properties were wrecked by bombing and others greatly damaged by having German troops billeted in them. - There isa housing problem in Jersey but it-ismOt as acute as ours. A. very considerableamount of rehabilitation has already taken place. ;
Guernsey.14. I arrived in Guernsey in the early afternoon of the 9th May and attended a cavalcade held in honour of the liberation. Decorated cars and horse-drawn vehicles, gay with flowers and flags, passed through an enormous crowd of people who were gathered along the principal sea front. The most strikingfeature, however, was a procession of schoolchildren, who paraded behind cardsinscribed &quot; Thank you,&quot; and then giving the name of the town in Scotland orthe north of England where they had been billeted during their evacuation. Afterthe procession had passed, the Bailiff called on me to speak. There was a tremendous crowd, estimated at 12,000 people. The King&apos;s gracious reply to theloyal message of the Islanders was received with prolonged cheering. My message of comfort and encouragement from His Majesty&apos;s Government was accorded avery warm welcome. The Lieutenant-Governor and I mingled with the crowd aswe judged the various items which had participated in the cavalcade.H.M.S. King George V was lying offshore and companies of sailors and marinestook part in the formal parade.15. In the evening the Lieutenant-Governor gave a small dinner-party at government House at which I had the opportunity of meeting the Commander-in-Chief, Home Fleet, other officers of H.M.S. King George V and some of theleading people of the Island. The Bailiff gave a dinner-party which was attended by the Under-Secretary. After dark there was a splendid firework display. Thegreat warship was illuminated and fired rockets.16. On Friday morning the Lieutenant-Governor and Bailiff conducted uson a tour of the island, during which I visited the tomato vineries, which are ina flourishing condition despite the shortage of fertilisers. We saw a parade ofthe famous Guernsey cattle. These industries have recovered and the Guernseypeople have generously made a gift of some fine animals from their herds to the island of Alderney. I met the representatives of the local government of eachof the parishes I entered and had a few words with them about the tasks theyare undertaking. All rejoiced at their deliverance and spoke with confidence ofthe future.17. On Friday evening, after our return from Alderney, we were enter-tained at a banquet by the States.  The utmost goodwill prevailed. :18. On Saturday morning I attended, with the Under-Secretary, a meetingof the States, to which I was welcomed by the Bailiff. My address in reply wassympathetically received and my appeal for steady work on the tasks of reconstruction applauded.19. With the Under-Secretary I then received deputations from the teaching profession of the Island, the trade union movement and theNon-Conformist Ministers. We discussed the difficulties of each group and gave them as much encouragement as we could in their efforts for the improve-ment of conditions on the Island. It was interesting to discover that the young people who had been in Great Britain during the war had come back to the island filled with an earnest desire to establish the youth service from which theyhad benefited during their exile from Guernsey.20. We were invited to attend a meeting of the Douzaine of St. Peter Port.This body is the Town Council of the capital of the island. Our attendancecreated a precedent in the history of one of the most ancient local governmentauthorities in the King&apos;s territories. Again our reception was most cordial andI took the opportunity to emphasise the importance of municipal affairs.Alderney.21. The entire population of this small Island, which we visited on Fridayafternoon, had been removed to England before the German occupation. TheGermans allowed its fine agricultural land to become overgrown with gorse wherethey did not overlay it with heavy concrete works. Its pre-war population wasabout 1,400 and not half of those have returned. The dairy industry is in process of re-establishment on a collective co-operative farm basis. A small airstrip makes communication with Guernsey and Jersey comparatively easy, andwill, I hope, help to bring back the tourist industry. Quarrying, which was thebasis of livelihood for 500 of the inhabitants before the war, has not yet been-established. The stone-crushing plant was dismantled by the enemy and themachinery taken to the Continent. The Germans, however, effected some improve-ments to the Harbour.
22. I visited the school, where from forty to fifty children were being taughtby three volunteer ladies from the general inhabitants. The children were bright,well dressed and very responsive. It was, however, rather startling to hear a boyread with a Scottish accent that would be an object of envy to any music hallcomedian parodying Harry Lauder or Will of e.22. Practically all the adult inhabitants of the Island met me in the cinema,which had been considerably improved by the Germans. I was the first HomeSecretary ever to have visited the Island during his term of office, and the Under-Secretary and I received a very great welcome. It was necessary here to speak with great caution as the Islanders are undoubtedly very individualistic andtheir reaction to the co-operative farm has not been all that one might desire. Thehead of the authority in the Island is called a Judge. He is an ex-Inspector of schools in Malaya and is a very good leader. A Rector has recently been appointed on a temporary engagement and is, I think, the right man for the job. My appealto the people to help themselves to bring the Island back to prosperity was well received. The Ministry of Agriculture have lent us an expert who is helping the farmers, but he indicated that some of the men are not responding to the opportunities that His Majesty&apos;s Government have afforded them. I discussed this matter with the Lieutenant-Governor and the Judge, and we are consideringtogether ways and means of providing a stimulus. The cattle which were paradedfor my inspection were fine and valuable specimens.General.23. I brought away from the Islands an ineffaceable memory of peoplegreatly and genuinely devoted to the British Crown and their connection with theBritish Commonwealth of Nations. Proud of their long history and of theirsuccessful resistance to all the German efforts by blandishment and coercion toestablish spiritual supremacy over them, they know that many of their easy ways and light taxation of the past have gone and are facing the new circumstanceswith courage and a determination to re-establish their trade and posterity. while they naturally cling to their ancient institutions, they recognise that they have entered a new world for which the machinery of government will need completeoverhaul if it is to be effective. In Jersey and Guernsey undoubtedly the Labourforces have received great encouragement from the Party&apos;s victory over here, andI have no doubt in due course they will send members to the States who will help to make the impact of the government of the Islands on economic conditions more effective than it has hitherto been. The visit of the Committee of the privy council to the Islands to examine the proposed new constitutions is eagerlyawaited, and I have no doubt that many people of all sections of society will desireto put their views before that body.24. I cannot close this report without alluding to the splendid and effectivework that has been done by the Lieutenant-Governors in these Islands Lieut.-General Sir A. E. Grasett in Jersey and General Philip Neame, V.C., in Guernsey.They have entered fully into all the difficulties of the people and command the respect and effection of all sections of the community. Everyone to whom I spokementioned in terms of the highest admiration the civilian activities of these twodistinguished soldiers. The Bailiffs of Jersey and Guernsey and the Judge ofAlderney also command the esteem of their peoples. They are men of great moralcourage and are giving effective leadership. The honours recently bestowed onrepresentative persons in all ranks of society gave great gratification to thepopulation.J C E\Uh May, 1946.
