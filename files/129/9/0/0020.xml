a.118(THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT).SECRETCP. (U6) 17021+th April, 19U6COPY NO. ^6CABINETREVISION OP ANGLO-EGYPTIAN TI-treaty)y the Secretary of State for Foreign affairs circulate for the information- of my colleaguesa translation of a note presented to the british delegation by the Egyptian Prime Minister.,EoBaForeign Office, ,20th April, 19h6oNOTE PRESENTED TO THE- BRITISH DELEGATION BYTHE EGYPTIAN PRgjE minister on Saturday the 20th April Sedky Pasha summonedthe officers forming the military &quot;bureau attached to theEg3rptian Delegation for the Negotiations and communicatedto them the aide memoire which had been handed to himon the previous day &quot;by His Excellency the british ambassador and Lord Stansgato,Their first reaction was wholly unfavourable.Sedky Pasha explained to them that he was onlyasking their technical opinion on the matter.He &quot;begged them to study the British suggestionsobjectively putting all considerations of sentiment toone side.&quot;The suggestions should&quot;,    he told them,, &quot;he regarded from the following angle.&quot;We are two allies of unequal strength who mayhave to face a powerful and rapid act of aggressionlaunched &quot;by an enemy of not less strength than GreatBritain..     Whatever Egyptian preparations may &quot;be, thedefence cannot he immediately in a state capable ofrepulsing the invader;    our British allies must thereforeintervene at once and they consider that the defence may prove to he ineffective without the presence in our country of a nucleus forming in advance an &quot;alliedadministrative base&quot; whose composition is set out indetail in the note and whose purpose will he to preparein time of peace for the reception of troops and

re-info re-inforcement format ions.&quot;Consider this without being influenced by thepolitical aspect of the suggestion;    I only ask you fora military opinion&quot;.The members of the bureau have handed theiropinion? in the form of the attached note, to Sedky Pashathis evening.The Prime Minister, after a personal examinationof the British aide memoire which was handed to him onthe 19th April and of the above note from his militarybureau, can only give his entire support to the latter&apos;conclusions.     He adds the following considerations whichwill be the last after the aeries of considerations whichhe has developed orally or in writing in recent da.ys.1. There is no longer- any doubt that, in the form setforth in the Aide Memoirs communicated on the 19th April,the base asked for in Egyptian territory constitutes averitable military occupation of this territory.2. This base, to which is added a British air forcecontingent, presents such a variety of aspects -including notably a veritable headquarters belonging toa foreign army - that the fiction consisting in saying thatit simply involves an.allied base cannot take away itstrue character from it.3. By the arrangement suggested by the Aide Memoirethe alliance between the two countries is reduced to amilitary tutelage exorcised by a big country over a smaller country which will rapidly degenerate - as infact has happened - into political supremacy.     an alliance based on equality cannot involve more thanconsultations and conversations between Staffs to arriveat a rational use of forces and preparation in commonof defence plans.h. Egypt would go as far as possible in this waysince she envisages a development of the cultural help tobe furnished by British schools for military instructionand a harmonious choice of the arms to be employed.5. .        The development of the power and effectiveness ofthe new Egyptian army, planned as a sign of the true and final liberation of the country, could not but suffer fromthe position of inferiority which would be created by thepresence of a British bas^-, of which the undoubtedinfluence would halt or discourage many initiatives.      Thefacts of a recent past are there to prove it.6. The same influence will continue to be exercised in the political field notwithstanding the assurances,often dictated by incontestable good faith, which areoffered.      This is ground on to which the present notedoes not wish to venture, since it would involveneedlessly the examination of a past which gave littlereason for confidence.

1207. After the final disappearance of the reasons whichdetermined the measures contemplated, by the treaty of1936, a country like Egypt could not agree that itsindependence should remain at the mercy of new andvai^ious reasons which&apos; the political repertory is never ata loss to discover.      An independent country should provide for its own security from its own resources, andthis should be so in Egypt&apos;s.case;&apos;  she does not want to fail in this task, but her dignity as a free countrycannot but refuse to alienate her independence as a resultof exaggerated and almost imaginary anxieties as toprobable dangers.      And if this could be explained to someextent before the last war, it would no longer he understood , since the creation of tho mechanism of world security inaugurated at Son Francisco, how an independentcountry could cheerfully allow its liberty to be fetteredby &quot;benevolent agreements of doubtful efficacy.8. It is now apparently a question of a danger from theEast,   just as later on, and even after the end of the alliance, it may he a question of quite a different dangerresulting from the difficulties of the moments or from anyother product of the alwaj^s fertile imagination ofChancelleries.9. It is not the aim of the present note to expatiateon the extent of the dangers to which world peace isexposed.      But may we remark that these perils are often,presented in a light in which a sometimes deliberatepessimism plays a leading part.     Russian policy iscertainly disturbing;    but it is more suspicious thandangero\is, and if the danger which it presents can arise from its immediate and neighbouring interests, Egyptcannot in any case be the country against which its firstact of aggression would take place, an act which distanceand the presence of.other intermediate countries, placed under British rule or influence, would render asinexplicable as it was inoperative.10.        In brief, and whatever may be the goodwill of theEgyptian negotiator or his influence on his compatriots,he would find it,  if not impossible,  at least verydifficult to convince them that their hopes for theindependence of their country and the integrity of its territory will have been substantially realised by theapplication of the last suggestions contained in theBritish note.In regard to Sedky Pasha personally, he regretsthat he cannot support such suggestions, which, moreover,are far from being in accordance with the terms of hismandate.11.       And since in regard, to Great Britain, the friendand ally of his country, he has obligations dictated byloyalty and sincerity, he owes it to himself to issue a warning that, as he has many times pointed out, a movement of public opinion (stimulated to an equal degreeby different causesi and currents) may at any momenttransform itself into an action which it was possibleto repress or contain at tho beginning of the present

121political campaign, but which may subsequently eludeall control.Sedky Pasha would be grateful if the foregoingconsiderations, as well as the technical note, could becommunicated to Mr.  Bevin..   (Initialled)  I.S.April 21st, 191*6

122NOTE BY EGYPTIAN MILITARY ADVISERSIn answer to the technical points raised in theBritish Aide Memoire, the military advisers have the honour to submit the following:-1. The increased responsibilities thrown upon theEgyptian Armed Forces to defend Egypt&apos;s territorial integrity are fully realised.      All the necessary stepsto maintain adequate forces for this object will be taken.It is, therefore, noted with satisfaction that the BritishGovernment has undertaken to facilitate in every way theprovision of modern equipment for the Egyptian armed forces. .   Such help will go far to aid Egypt inexecuting the necessary defence xjlans.2. The Egyptian defence plans will provide not onlyone but several administrative bases in various partsof the country.    Such bases will be established and maintained by Egjrptian personnel only and so organisedas to receive local reserves and Allied reinforcementson their arrival.In siting and designing such bases, the EgyptianGeneral Staff will give due consideration to suggestionsrecommended by the British Government for the proposedadministrative base, on condition that it will beestablished and maintained also bj.&apos; Egyptian personnelonly.3. While the withdrawal programme is being carriedout, the Egyptian Government will send the necessarjrEgyptian personnel to such airfields, Naval bases, signaland radar installations to receive the requisiteinstructions necessary tc enable them to establish and maintain the required base as well as the air defence organisation and naval facilities.h* The Egyptian Government can not accept the proposedsuggestion of retaining a small number of R.A.P. fighter squadrons in the Canal Zone, for the following reasons:-1.    Egypt will provide for the necessary number of fighter squadrons in the Canal Zone to intercept andcombat the initial air attack.    The number of theEgyptian fighter squadrons will be increasedgradually as R.E.A.F.  develops.2.    Experience gained in the last War has shewn thatfighter squadrons based on Palestine and Cyprus can easily co-operate in the interception of enemy aircraftheading for the attack on the Suez Canal area.Similarly other fighter squadrons based on Lybia canperform the same duties against air attacks from theWest.3.    Furthermore, air reinforcements can arrive in amatter of hours from the aforementioned stations ifnecessary. *q..    A powerful aggressor stands no chance in carryingout an air invasion of Egypt unless his air bases are brought nearer to Egyptian territory.     Airborne troops

123must have, in addition, air superiority in the area of invasion, and with the present Allied distribution ofairfields and fighter commands in the Middle East, theonly course open to such an aggression will he &quot;by heavy and massed bombing which can easily be intercepted by both British air bases round Egypt and by the Egyptianfighter squadrons from inside the country.-     Radarequipment and A.A.  defence measures will add to the efficient of this immediate defence.    Moreoverpreparations in puaco time will be made to earmark and maintain such airfields as to be ready, in the event ofemergency, to receive these fighter squadrons, ifnecessary, as soon as they arrive.5. The administrative organisation which is at presentin Egypt should be liquidated as early as possible, subjectto the general withdrawal programme which will be agreed upon by both sides.      Such an organisation can easily beestablished outside Egyptian territory, where it can carryout the administrative duties specified in the British AideMemoire.6.- It is felt that the establishment of the proposedAllied headquarters in the Canal Zone is both unnecessary and inconsistent with the political independence of Egypt.-In order to concert security measures, it. issuggested, that occasional staff talks be held to discusssuch measures.&apos;7. The Egyptian Government will accord the necessary facilities in the Canal Zone for occasional transit ofBritish Forces, subject only to International Law.(Signed) Ahmed Handi..Lewa..21st April, 191+6.
