EIRE  AND   U.N.O.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.WHEN the Cabinet, on the 14th February, discussed my paper (CP. (46) 59)proposing that (a) we should support an application by Eire for membership of U.N.O. if she wished us to do so, and(6) we should aim at securing Eire&apos;s admission among the first foreignneutral countries on application being made by the latter,consideration of it was adjourned. I should like to inform my colleagues how this matter now stands.2. After the above-mentioned Cabinet meeting, at the instance of theForeign Secretary, I went into the general question of policy again in consulta-tion with him and the Home Secretary, and we, for our part, reached the following conclusions : (1) The present policy of His Majesty&apos;s Government should be not to approach any potential candidates for membership of U.N.O. or give any encouragement to them to apply for membership.(2) While His Majesty&apos;s Government would take no initiative in the matterof Eire&apos;s candidature, they should recognise her right to receive no less favourable treatment from His Majesty&apos;s Government thanrespectable foreign States who might be considered for membership.(3) If Eire were to apply for membership of her own volition, the UnitedKingdom representative on the Security Council should vote in favourof her application.(4) The United Kingdom representative on the Security Council should adopt a favourable attitude towards Eire&apos;s claim to membership,although without going out of his way to champion her, if Eire&apos;s casecame up in the course of any review of potential candidates by theSecurity Council.The Prime Minister has since endorsed these conclusions and they have now been communicated to the United Kingdom representative on the Security Council forhis guidance.A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,nth April, 1946.[31672]THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet,   April 1946.SECRET Copy No.   38CP.
