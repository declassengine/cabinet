TO PALESTINE (General sir A. Cunningham)FROM S.   OF S..  COLONIES22nd April,  19h7.Anglo-American Committee have submitted unanimousreport.      I hope to send advance copy to you very shortly.Further telegram will- be sent on this point.      Meanwhile,following is outline of recommendations (which are underurgent consideration here).      Please telegraph any commentswith your appreciation of probable local reaction with least possible delay as matter will be discussed by Ministers onWednesday.      Outline begins.1.        European Problem.      Information received about countries other than Palestine gave no hope of substantial assistancein finding homes for Jews wishing or impelled to leave Europe-.Palestine alone cannot meet the emigration needs of Jewishvictims of Nazi and Fascist persecution.      British and american governments together and in association with other countries should endeavour immediately to find homes for all suchdisplaced persons irrespective of creed or nationality whoseties with their former communities have been irreparably broken.Though emigration will solve- the problems of some,  the overwhelming majority including a considerable number of Jewswill continue to live in Europe.      British and american governments should therefore endeavour to secure that immediate effect is given to provision of United Nations Charter calling foruniversal respect for and observance of human rights and .fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race,  sex,language or religion.2.        Refugee Immirration into Palestine.      One hundred thousandcertificates should be authorised immediately for admission into palestine of Jews who have been victims of Nazi and Fascistpersecution.      These are to be awarded as far as possible in1946 and actual immigration pushed forward as rapidly asconditions will permit.      In awarding certificates priority should as far as possible be given to those in the &quot;centimes&quot; andto those liberated in Germany and Austria who are no &quot;longer in the centres but remain in those countries.      Primary consideration should be given to aged and infirm, to the very young and tosk i11e d wo rkmen.3*        Principles of Government.      A clear statement of following-principles should be made -(l)  that Jew shall not dominate Arab and Arab shall notdominate Jew in Palestine;(II)  that Palestine shall be neither a Jewish state nor an arab state;(III)  that form of Government ultimately to be established shallunder international guarantees fully protect and preserve interests&apos; in Holy Land of Christendom and moslem and Jewish faiths.      Palestine must ultimatelybecome a state which guards the rights and interestsof Moslem, Jews and Christians alike andaccords toinhabitants as a whole fullest measure of self-government consistent with these three paramountpririciples.ANNEX

k*       Mandate and United Nations Trusteeship.     Now and for acmetime to come any attempt to. establish an independent Palestinian Statfor -states would result in civil strife such as might threaten thepeace of the world.      Committee therefore recommend that untilhostility between Jews and Arabs disappears the Government ofPalestine be continued as at present under Mandate pendingexecution of a Trusteeship Agreement under United. Nations.&quot;5.       Equality of Standards.      The Mandatory or Trustee shouldproclaim principle that Arab economic,  educational and politicaladvancement in Palestine is of equal importance with that of theJews and should at once prepare measures designed, to bridge the gap which now exists and raise Arab standard of living to thatof the jews and so bring the two peoples to a full appreciation of their common interest and common destiny in the land where bothbelong.      Committee suggest consideration of advisability of encouraging formation of Arab community on lines of existingJewi sh c omrnun i ty.6.        Future Immigration Policy.      pending early reference to united Nations and execution of a Trusteeship agreement, Mandatoryshould administer Palestine according to the Mandate which declares that,  &quot;The administration of Palestine, while ensuring that therights and position of other sections of the population are notprejudiced,  shall facilitate Jewish immigration under suitableconditions&quot;.      Committee refer to difficulty of looking far intothe future.      They cannot recommend fixing of a minimum or maximumfor annual immigration in the future but think it must be concededthat it should be the right of the Government of Palestine todecide having regard to the well-being of all the people ofPalestine number of immigrants to be admitted within any givenperiod.      They reject views that there shall be no furtherimmigration without Arab acquiescence and also that every Jewcan enter Palestine as of right without regard to conditions imposed by the Government upon entry.7.       Land Policy.     land Transfers Regulations 19^-0 to berescinded and replaced by regulations based on policy of freedom in sale,  lease or use of land irrespective of race,  community orcreed and providing adequate protection for interests of smallowners and tenant cultivators.      Steps should be taken to rendernugatory any prescribed provisions in conveyances, leases and agreements which stipulate that only members of one race, community or creed may be employed.      Government should exercise such closesupervision over holy places and localities as well as protect them from desecration and from courses which offend conscience of religious people.      Alienation of land to Jewish National Fundor for Waqf requires watching.8.        Economic Development.      Various plans for large-scale development have been presented which if successful could notonly gradually enlarge capacity of the country to supportincreasing population, but also raise living standard of Jew andArab alike.      Committee are- not in a position to assess soundness ospecific plans but urge that however technically feasible they maybe they will fail unless there is peace in Palestine.      Their fullsuccess requires willing co-operation of adjacent Arab states.Committee recommend therefore that examination, discussion and execution of these plans be conducted in full consultation andco-operation not only with Jewish Agency,  but also with Governmentsof neighbouring Arab states directly affected.      Such projectsas that for Jordan Valley Authority should not be undertaken by any private organisation but are suitable for Government enterprise.Some compromise should not be impossible which would combine-Jewish finance with Government responsibility and control.

110Committee welcome Government&apos; - programme i)f post-war development,but could wish that means might be found for projects of largerrange.      They recognise however that till political peace isrestored there  is great difficulty in raising necessary funds.Meanwhile Government should acquire powers to investigate extentof country1 s //ater resources,  control use of underground water and determine rights to surface water.      Committee doubt if Palestinecan expand its economy to full without full and free interchange ofgoods and services with neighbouring countries.     Removal of;,rticle 18 of Mandate would clear the way to those comprehensivetariff and trade agreements which could ultimately lead to something like a customs union,,9.        Educations      In the interests of conciliation of the twopeoples and of general improvement of grab standard of livingeducational system of Jews and grabs should be reformed includingintroduction of compulsory education within a reasonable time.Adequate control must be exercised by the Government over education of both Jews and grab:&quot; tc do away with present emphasis onracialism and perversion of education for propaganda purposes.If goal of compulsory education is set, a much higher proportionof annual Palestinian Budget must be devoted to education, mostof which will be spent on Arab education.      Committee urge necessity of.&apos;increasing facilities for secondary,   technical and university education for Arabs.10.      Need for Peace in Palestine,    It should be made clear that anyattempt from either side by threats of violence,, terrorism organisation or use of&quot;illegal armies to prevent execution of theReport Will be resolutely suppressed.      The Jewish Agency should atonce resume active co-operation with the Mandatory in suppression of terrorism and of illegal immigration and in maintenance of thatlaw and order throughout Palestine which is essential for good ofall including new immigrants.      Ends.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTVS GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1946.The circulation Of this paper ha^been strictly limrttti.   It is issued for the personal use of top secret copy No.D.O. (46) 61.22nd April, 1946.CABINET.Defence Committee.REPORT. OF THE ANGLO-AMERICAN COMMITTEE OF enquiry into PALESTINE AND THE CONDITION OF JEWS IN EUROPE.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.I circulate herewith, for the information of the Defence Committee threechapters of the Anglo-American Committee&apos;s report (chapters 1, 9 and 10).These three chapters are by far the most important part of the report, andcontain the committee&apos;s recommendations and their views on the question ofpublic security in Palestine.The whole report is being printed, but will not be available until next week.Foreign Office,22nd April, 1946.ANGLO-AMERICAN COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY.Report to the United States Government and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentin the United Kingdom.Recommendation No. 1.We have to report that such information as we received about countries otherthan Palestine gave no hope of substantial assistance in finding homes for &quot;Jewswishing or impelled to leave Europe.But Palestine alone cannot meet the emigration needs of the Jewish victims of Nazi and Fascist persecution. The whole toorld shares responsibility for them,and indeed for the re-settlement of all &quot; displaced persons.&quot;E. B.PART I.CHAPTER I.-RECOMMENDATIONS AND COMMENTS.The European Problem.13271   [31686] 1b
We therefore recommend that our Governments together, and in association with other countries, should endeavour immediately to find new homes for all such&quot; displaced persons,&quot; irrespective of creed or nationality, whose ties with their former communities have been irreparably broken.Though emigration will solve the problems of some victims of persecution,the overwhelming majority, including a considerable number of Jews, will con-tinue to live in Europe. We recommend therefore that our Governmentsendeavour to secure that immediate effect is given to the provision of the united nations Charter calling for &quot; universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedom for all without distinction as to race, seat,language, or religion.&quot;Comment.In recommending that our Governments, in association with other countries,should endeavour to find new homes for &quot; displaced persons,&quot; we do not suggestthat any country should be asked to make a permanent change in its immigration policy. The conditions, which we have seen in Europe, are unprecedented, andso unlikely to arise again that we are convinced that special provision could andshould be made in existing immigration laws to meet this unique and peculiarlydistressing situation. Furthermore, we believe that much could be accomplished particularly in regard to those &quot;displaced persons,&quot; including Jews, who haverelatives in countries outside Europe -by a relaxation of administrativeregulations.Our investigations have led us to believe that a considerable number of Jewswill continue to live in most European countries. In our view the mass emigra-tion of all European Jews would be of service neither to the Jews themselves nor to Europe. Every effort should be made to enable the Jews to rebuild theirshattered communities, while permitting those Jews who wish to do so to emigrate.In order to achieve this, restitution of Jewish property should be effected as soonas possible. Our investigations showed us that the Governments chiefly concerned had for the most part already passed legislation to this end. A real obstacle,however, to individual restitution is that the attempt to give effect to this legis-lation is frequently a cause of active anti-Semitism. We suggest that, for thereconstruction of the Jewish communities, restitution of their corporate property,either through reparations payments or through other means, is of the first importance.Nazi occupation has left behind it a legacy of anti-Semitism. This cannotbe combated by legislation alone. The only really effective antidotes are the enforcement by each Government of guaranteed civil liberties and equal rights,a programme of education in the positive principles of democracy, the sanction of a strong world public opinion combined with economic recovery and stability.Refugee Immigration into Palestine.Recommendation No. 2.We recommend (A) that 100,000 certificates be authorised immediately forthe admission into Palestine of Jews who have been the victims of Nazi andFascist persecution; (B) that these certificates be aivarded as far as possible in1946 ana that actual immigration be pushed forward as rapidly as conditions will permit.Comment.The number of Jewish survivors of Nazi and Fascist persecution with whom we have to deal far exceeds 100,000 : indeed there are more than that number in Germany, Austria and Italy alone. Although nearly a year has passed since their liberation, the majority of those in Germany and Austria are still living in assembly centres, the so-called &quot;camps,&quot; island communities in the midstof those at whose hands they suffered so much.In their interests and in the interests of Europe, the centres should be closedand their camp life ended. Most of them have cogent reasons for wishing toleave Europe. Many are the sole survivors of their families and few have anyties binding them to the countries in which they used to live.Since the end of hostilities, little has been done to provide for their resettle-ment elsewhere.   Immigration laws and restrictions bar their entry to most
countries and much time must pass before such laws and restrictions can be altered and effect given to the alterations. Some can go to countries where theyhave relatives; others may secure inclusion in certain quotas. Their number is comparatively small.We know of no country to which the great majority can go in the immediatefuture other than Palestine. Furthermore, that is where almost all of themwant to go. There they are sure that they will receive a welcome denied themelsewhere.   There they hope to enjoy peace and rebuild their lives.We believe it is essential that they should be given an opportunity to do soat the earliest possible time. Furthermore, we have the assurances of the leadersof the Jewish Agency that they will be supported and cared for.We recommend the authorisation and issue of 100,000 certificates for these reasons and because we feel that their immediate issue will have a most salutary effect upon the whole situation.In the awarding of these certificates priority should as far as possible begiven to those in the centres, and to those liberated in Germany and Austria whoare no longer in the centres but remain in those countries. We do not desire that other Jewish victims who wish or will be impelled by their circumstances to leave the countries where they now are, or that those who fled from persecutionbefore the outbreak of war, should be excluded. We appreciate that there willbe difficulty in deciding questions of priority, but none the less we urge that sofar as possible such a system should be adhered to. and that, in applying it,primary consideration should be given to the aged and infirm, to the very youngand also to skilled workmen whose services will be needed for many months on work rendered necessary by the large influx.It should be made clear that no advantage in the obtaining of a certificateis to be gained by migrating from one country to another, or by entering Palestineillegally.Eeceiving so large a number will be a heavy burden on Palestine. We feel sure that the authorities will shoulder it and that they will have the full co-operation of the Jewish Agency.Difficult problems will confront those responsible for organising and carryingout the movement. The many organisations public and private working inEurope will certainly render all the aid they can : we mention U.N.R.R.A.especially.   Co-operation by all throughout is necessary.We are sure that the Government of the United States, which has shownsuch keen interest in this matter, will participate vigorously and generouslywith the Government of Great Britain in its fulfilment. There are many ways in which help can be given.Those who have opposed the admission of these unfortunate people into palestine should know that we have fully considered all that they have put beforeus. We hope that they will look upon the situation again, that they will appreciate the considerations which have led us to our conclusion, and that above all, ifthey cannot see their way to help, at least they will not make the position ofthese sufferers more difficult.Principles of Government : No Arab, No Jewish State.Recommendation No. 3.In order to dispose, once and for all, of the exclusive claims of Jews and arabs to Palestine, we regard it as essential that a clear statement of the following principles should be made: /. That Jew shall not dominate Arab and Arab shall not dominate Jewin Palestine. II. That Palestine shall be neither a Jewish State nor an arab state. III. That the form, of government ultimately to be established, shall,under international guarantees, fully protect and preserve the interests in the holy Land of Christendom and of the Moslem, and Jewish faiths.Thus Palestine must ultimately become a State which guards the^ rights and interests of Moslems, Jews and Christians alike: and accords to the inhabitants,as a whole, the fullest measure of self-government, consistent with the threeparamount principles set forth above.Comment.Throughout the long and bloody struggle of Jew and Arab for dominancein Palestine, each crying fiercely : &quot; This land is mine &quot; except for the brief[31686] B 2
reference in the report of the Royal Commission (hereinafter referred to as thePeel Report) and the little evidence, written and oral, that we received on thispoint the great interest of the Christian world in Palestine has been completelyoverlooked, glossed over or brushed aside.We, therefore, emphatically declare that Palestine is a Holy Land, sacredto Christian, to Jew and to Moslem alike; and because it is a Holy Land, palestine is not, and can never become, a land which any race or religion can justly claimas its very own.We further, in the same emphatic way, affirm that the fact that it is the holy Land, sets Palestine completely apart from other lands, and dedicates itto the precepts and practices of the Brotherhood of Man, not those of narrownationalism.Por another reason, in the light of its long history, and particularly itshistory of the last thirty years, Palestine cannot be regarded as either a purelyArab or a purely Jewish land.The Jews have a historic connexion with the country. The Jewish national home, though embodying a minority of the population, is to-day a realityestablished under international guarantee. It has a right to continued existence,protection and development.Yet Palestine is not, and never can be, a purely Jewish land. It lies atthe crossroads of the Arab world. Its Arab population, descended from long-timeinhabitants of the area, rightly look upon Palestine as their homeland.It is therefore neither just nor practicable that Palestine should becomeeither an Arab State, in which an Arab majority would control the destinyof a Jewish minority, or a Jewish State, in which a Jewish majority wouldcontrol that of an Arab minority. In neither case would minority guaranteesafford adequate protection for the subordinated group.A Palestinian put the matter thus : &quot;In the hearts of us Jews there hasalways been a fear that some day this country would be turned into an arab state and the Arabs would rule over us. This fear has, at times, reached the proportions of terror .... Now this same feeling of fear has started up inthe hearts of Arabs .... fear lest the Jews acquire the ascendancy and ruleover them.&quot;Palestine, then, must be established as a country in which the legitimatenational aspirations of both Jews and Arabs can be reconciled, without either side fearing the ascendancy of the other. In our view this cannot be done under any form of constitution in which a mere numerical majority is decisive, since it is precisely the struggle for a numerical majority which bedevils Arab-Jewishrelations. To ensure genuine self-government for both the Arab and the Jewishcommunities, this struggle must be made purposeless by the constitution itself.Mandate and United Nations Trusteeship.Recommendation No. 4.We have reached the conclusion that the hostility between Jews and arabs and, in particular, the determination of each to achieve domination, if necessary by violence, make it almost certain that, now and for some time to come, anyattempt to establish either an independent Palestinian State or independentPalestinian States tvould result in civil strife such as might threaten the peace of the world. We therefore recommend that, until this hostility disappears, theGovernment of Palestine be continued as at present under Mandate pending theexecution, of a Trusteeship) A greement under the United Nations.Comment.We recognise that in view of the powerful forces both Arab and Jewish,operating from outside Palestine, the task of Great Britain, as Mandatory, hasnot been easy. The Peel Commission declared in 1937 that the Mandate wasunworkable, and the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nationsthereupon pointed out that it became almost unworkable once it was publiclydeclared to be so by such a body. Two years later the British Government, havingcome to the conclusion that the alternative of Partition proposed by the PeelCommission was also unworkable, announced their intention of taking steps to terminate the Mandate by the establishment of an independent Palestine State.Our recommendations are based on what we believe at this stage to be as fair ameasure of justice to all as we can find in view of what has gone before and of all
5113that has been done. We recognise that they are not in accord with the claims of, either party, and furthermore that they involve a departure from the recentpolicy of the Mandatory. We recognise that, if they are adopted, they will involve a long period of trusteeship, which will mean a very heavy burden forany single Government to undertake, a burden which would be lightened if thedifficulties were appreciated and the Trustee had the support of other membersof the United Nations.Equality of Standards.Recommendation No. 5.Looking towards a form of ultimate self-government, consistent with thethree principles laid down in Recommendation No. 3, we recommend that theMandatory or Trustee should proclaim the principle that Arab economic,educational and political advancement in Palestine is of equal importance withthat of the Jews; and should at once prepare measures designed to bridge the gap which now exists and raise the Arab standard of living to that of the Jews;and so bring the two peoples to a full appreciation of their common interest and common destiny in the land where both belong.Comment.Our examination of conditions in Palestine led us to the conclusion that oneof the chief causes of friction is the great disparity between the Jewish and Arabstandards of living. Even under conditions of war, which brought considerable financial benefits to the Arabs, this disparity has not been appreciably reduced.Only by a deliberate and carefully planned policy on the part of the Mandatoryoan the Arab standard of living be raised to that of the Jews. In stressing theneed for such a policy we would particularly call attention to the discrepanciesbetween the social services, including hospitals, available in Palestine for jews and Arabs.We fully recognise that the Jewish social services are financed to a very great extent by the Jewish community in Palestine, with the assistance of outsideJewish organisations; and we would stress that nothing should be done whichwould bring these social services down to the level of those provided for the Arabs,or halt the constant improvements now being made in them.- We suggest that consideration be given to the advisability of encouraging the formation by the Arabs of an Arab community on the lines of the jewish community which now largely controls and finances Jewish social services. TheArabs will have to rely, to a far greater extent than the Jews, on financial aid from the Government. But the Jews of Palestine should accept the necessity thattaxation, raised from both Jews and Arabs, will have to be spent very largely on the Arabs in order to bridge the gap which now exists between the standardof living of the two peoples.Future, Immigration Policy.Recommendation No. 6.We recommend that pending the early reference to the United Nations andthe execution of a Trusteeship Agreement, the Mandatory should administerPalestine according to the Mandate which declares with regard to immigrationthat &quot;the Administration of Palestine, while ensuring that the lights and position of other sections of the population are not prejudiced, shall facilitateJewish immigration under suitable conditions.&quot;Comment.We have recommended the admission of 100,000 immigrants, victims of Nazipersecution, as soon as possible. We now deal with the position after the admission of that number. We cannot look far into the future. We cannotconstruct a yardstick for annual immigration. Until a Trusteeship agreement is executed it is our clear opinion that Palestine should be administered inaccordance with the terms of the Mandate quoted above.Further than that we cannot go in the form of a recommendation. In thisdisordered world speculation as to the economic position of any country a fewyears ahead would be a hazardous proceeding. It is particularly difficult to predict what, after a few years have passed, will be the economic and political
condition of Palestine. We hope that the present friction and turbulence will soon die away and be replaced by an era of peace, absent so long from the HolyLand; that-the Jew and Arab will soon realise that collaboration is to their mutual advantage, but no one can say how long this will take.The possibility of the country sustaining a largely increased population ata decent standard of living depends on its economic future, which in turn dependslargely on whether or not plans referred to in Recommendation No. 8 can bebrought to fruitiomThe Peel Commission stated that political as well as economic considerationshave to be taken into account in regard to immigration, and recommended a&quot; political high level &quot; of 12,000 a year. We cannot recommend the fixing of aminimum or of a maximum for annual immigration in the future. There are too many uncertain factors.We desire, however, to state certain considerations which we agree shouldbe taken into account in determining what number of immigrants there shouldbe in any period. It is the right of every independent nation to determine inthe interests of its people the number of immigrants to be admitted to its lands.Similarly it must, we think, be conceded that it should be the right of the Govern-ment of Palestine to decide, having regard to the well-being of all the people ofPalestine, the number of immigrants to be admitted within any given period.In Palestine there is the Jewish National Home, created in consequence ofthe Balfour Declaration. Some may think that that Declaration was wrong andshould not have been made; some that it was a conception on a grand scale andthat effect can be given to one of the most daring and significant colonisationplans in history. - Controversy as to which view is right is fruitless. TheNational Home is there. Its roots are deep in the soil of Palestine. It cannotbe argued out of existence; neither can the achievements of the Jewish pioneers.The Government of Palestine in having regard to the well-being of all thepeople of Palestine cannot ignore the interests of so large a section of the popula-tion. It cannot ignore the achievements of-the last quarter of a century. no government of Palestine, doing its duty to the people of that land, can fail todo its best, not only to maintain the National Home, but also to foster its properdevelopment and such development must, in our view, involve immigration.The well-being of all the people of Palestine, be they Jews, Arabs or neither,must be the governing consideration. We reject the view that there shall beno further Jewish immigration into Palestine without Arab acquiescence, a view which would result in the Arab dominating the Jew. We also reject the insistentJewish demand that forced Jewish immigration must proceed apace in order toproduce as quickly as possible a Jewish majority and a Jewish State. The well-being of the Jews must not be subordinated to that of the Arabs; nor that ofthe Arabs to the Jews. The well-being of both, the economic situation of Palestineas a whole, the degree of execution of plans for further development, all have tobe carefuly considerd in deciding the number of immigrants for any particularperiod.Palestine is a land sacred to three Faiths and must not become the land ofany one of them to the exclusion of the others, and Jewish immigration for thedevelopment of the National Home must not become a policy of discrimination against other immigrants. Any person, therefore, who desires and is qualifiedunder applicable laws to enter Palestine must not be refused admission orsubjected to discrimination on the ground that he is not a Jew. All provisionsrespecting immigration must be drawn, executed and applied with that principlealways firmly in mind.Further, while we recognise that any Jew who enters Palestine in accordancewith its laws is there of right, we expressly disapprove of the position taken insome Jewish quarters that Palestine has.in some way been ceded or granted as their State to the Jews of the world, that every Jew everywhere is, merely because he is a Jew, a citizen of Palestine and therefore can enter Palestine as of rightwithout regard to conditions imposed by the Government upon entry, and that therefore there can be no illegal immigration of Jews into Palestine. We declareand affirm that any immigrant Jew who enters Palestine contrary to its laws isan illegal immigrant.Land Policy.Recommendation No. 7.(A) We recommend that the Land Transfers Regulations of 1940 berescinded and replaced by regulations based on a policy of freedom in the sale,lease or use of land, irrespective of race, commxmity or creed; and providing
7114adequate protection for the interests of small owners and tenant cultivators.(B) We further recommend that steps be taken to render nugatory and to prohibit provisions in conveyances, leases and agreements relating to land whichstipulate that only members of one race, community or creed may be employedon or about or in connexion therewith. (C) We recommend that the Govern-ment should exercise such close supervision over the Holy places and localitiessuch as the Sea of Galilee and its vicinity as will protect them from desecrationand from uses which offend the conscience of religious people; and that suchlaws as are required for this purpose be enacted forthwith.Comment.The Land Transfers Regulations of 1940 sought to protect the Arab tenantand small owner by prohibiting the sale of land save -to a Palestinian Arab inone zone, by restricting such sales in another, and allowing unrestricted sale ofland only in the third zone. Their effect has been such as to amount todiscrimination against the Jews; their tendency is to segregate and keep separateArabs and Jews. In the zones where sales are prohibited or restricted, theyhave protected the Arab from the temptation to dispose of his land, on whichhis livelihood and that of his family so often depend, for a sum out of all proportion to its real value. Though made with the object of maintaining theexisting standard of living of Arab cultivators, and of preventing the creationof a considerable landless Arab population, they afford no protection to the Arabliving in the free zone. He may sell his land for a fantastic price and add tothe congestion in the other zones by moving there. An Arab living a short distance away, just across the zone boundary, cannot obtain anything approxi-mating the same sum for land of equal quality.We are opposed to any legislation or restrictions discriminating againstJew or Arab. We recognise the need for protecting the Arab small owner and tenant, for providing against a large landless Arab population, for maintaining,indeed for raising, the Arab standard of living. This necessity was also recognised in the Peel Report (Chapter IX, paragraph 10) which endorsed thefollowing principles of earlier reports, that : (i) unless there is a marked changein the methods of cultivation the land in Palestine is unable to support a large increase in the population, and (ii) there is already congestion on -the land in the hill districts.  Those principles are as true, if not truer, to-day.. We do not believe that the necessary protection for the Arab can-be providedonly by confining the Jew to particular portions of Palestine. Such a policy,suggested by the Peel Commission, is consistent with their proposed solution,partition, but scarcely with that put forward by us.The leases granted by the Jewish National Fund contain a provision thatno labour other than Jewish shall be employed by the lessee on or about or inconnexion with the land subject to the lease, and a further provision that asub-lease shall contain similar terms.As we have said we are opposed to such discrimination. We appreciate that one of the reasons for such provisions was to secure employment for jewish immigrants on the land. We do not think that that object justifies the retentionof such stipulations which are harmful to co-operation and understanding between Arab and Jew.Land acquired by the Jewish National Fund or for a Waqf by the SupremeMoslem Council becomes inalienable. The Peel Commission expressed the view in its Report (Chapter IX, paragraph 80) that caution on the part of theGovernment in disposing of State domain to these bodies was desirable. Thesituation requires watching. It would not be to the interests of the inhabitants of Palestine if too large a proportion of the land should become inalienablewhether held by one organisation or another.In the small, thickly populated country of Palestine, with its rapidly increasing population, it is in the interest of Jews and Arabs alike that all land should be developed and put to the fullest possible use. The settlement of title to land should proceed as quickly as possible and the development of State lands,not required for public purposes and capable of use, should be facilitated.The Holy Land of Palestine contains within its borders and throughout itsterritories places sacred to the followers of three great religions. The &apos;&apos; Lido &apos;&apos;with its dancing and swing music on the shore of the Sea of Galilee offends thesensibilities of many Christian people. Reports came to our notice of other projects, the completion of which would be equally objectionable. We thereforefeel it right by our recommendation to emphasise the necessity for close supervision and to recommend the strengthening of the law should that be required.
\Economic Development.Recommendation No. 8.Various plans for large-scale agricultural and industrial development inPalestine have been presented for our consideration; these projects, if successfidlycarried into effect, could not only greatly enlarge the capacity of the country tosupport an increasing population, but also raise the living standards of Jew andArab alike.We are not in a position to assess the sotindness of these specific plans; butwe cannot state too strongly that, however technically feasible they may be, theywill fail unless there is peace in Palestine. Moreover, their full sticcess requires the willing co-operation of adjacent Arab States, since they are not merelyPalestinian projects. We recommend, therefore, that the examination, discussion and execution of these plans be conducted, from the start and throughout, in full consultation and co-operation not only with the Jewish A gency but also with theGovernments of the neighbouring Arab States directly affected.Comment.The building of the Jewish economy has enjoyed the advantage of abundantcapital, provided on such terms as to make economic return a secondaryconsideration. The Arabs have had no such advantage. In principle, we do notthink it wise or appropriate that plans, such as the project for a Jordan ValleyAuthority, should, if judged technically sound, be undertaken by any privateorganisation, even though that organisation, as suggested by the Jewish Agency,should give an assurance of Arab benefits and Arab participation in themanagement.Such proposals, by reason of their magnitude and far-reaching effects, shouldbe conceived as public projects, suitable for Government enterprise and acceptedonly provided that they are calculated to benefit all parts of the population. Butthe undertaking of a worth-while project should not be held up merely from financial considerations which could be overcome with the aid of semi-philan-thropic resources. Some compromise should not be impossible which wouldcombine Jewish finance with Government responsibility and control.We welcome the knowledge that the Government of Palestine has itselfprepared programmes of post-war development; we could wish that means mightbe found for projects of. larger range and on a more ambitious scale; but we recognise that until political peace is restored there is great difficulty in raising the necessary funds whether from revenue or borrowing.Meanwhile, it is suggested that the Government should acquire powers, atpresent lacking, to investigate fully the extent of the country&apos;s water resources,to control the use of underground water and to determine rights to surface water.We doubt wheher Palestine can expand its economy to the full, having regardto its limited natural resources, without a full and free interchange of goods and services with neighbouring countries. In some respects, indeed, as in certainprojects involving water supply, their active collaboration is indispensable to full development on an economic basis. .The removal of Article 18 of the Mandate would clear the way to thosecomprehensive tariff and trade agreements, not conflicting with any international obligations that might be accepted by the Mandatory or Trustee, which couldultimately lead to something like a customs union an objective already in mind as between the surrounding countries of the Arab League.Education.Recommendation No. 9.We recommend that, in the interests of the conciliation of the two peoples andof general improvement of the Arab standard of living, the educational system ofboth Jews and A arabs be reformed including the introduction of compulsoryeducation within a reasonable time.Comment.In Chapter XVI of the Peel Report, the bad features of the educational system of Palestine and the great disparity between the money spent on arab and Jewish education were pointed out.  The Report- also emphasised that both   \Jewish and Arab education in Palestine were nationalistic in character.Particular attention was called to nationalist propaganda in Arab schools.
9 115Our investigations disclosed that to-day the Jewish schools also-controlled and largely financed by the Jewish community are imbued with a fiery spiritof nationalism. They have become most effective agencies for inculcating a spirit-of aggressive Hebrew nationalism. We would urge most strongly that adequate control must be exercised by the Government over the education of both jews and Arabs, in order to do away with the present excited emphasis on racialism;and the perversion, of education: for propaganda purposes. The Governmentshould ensure, by a careful supervision of text books and curricula, and byinspection of schools that education contributes to the conciliation: of the twopeoples.We believe further, that a large share of responsibility for Arab educationmight well be assumed by. an Arab community, similar to the Jewish communityalready established in Palestine. But if the Arab and Jewish communities areto set themselves the goal of compulsory education, a much higher proportion ofthe annual Palestinian budget must be devoted to education than heretofore, mostof which will be spent on Arab education. This will only be possible if theproportion of the budget now devoted to security can be substantially reduced.We would also stress the urgent necessity of increasing the facilities forsecondary, technical and university education available to Arabs. The disparity between the standard of living of the two peoples, to which we have already drawn attention, is very largely due to the fact that the Jewish professional, and middleclass so largely outnumbers that of the Arabs. This difference can only beremoved by a very substantial increase in the facilities for higher educationavailable to Arabs.The.Need for Peace in Palestine.Recommendation. No. 10.We recommend that, if this Report is adopted, it shotdd be made clear-beyond all doubt to both Jev)s and Arabs that any attempt from either side, bythreats of violence, by terrorism, or by the organisation or use of illegal armiesto prevent its exemption, will be resolutely suppressed.Furthermore, we express the view that the Jewish Agency should at onceresume active co-operation with the mandatory in the suppression of terrorismand of illegal immigration, and in the maintenance of that law 1 and orderthroughout Palestine which is essential for the good of all, including the newimmigrants.CHAPTER IX-PUBLIC SECURITY.1. Palestine is an armed camp. We saw signs of this almost as soon as we^crossed the frontier, and we became more and more aware of the tense atmosphere-each day. Many buildings have barbed wire and&apos;other defences. We ourselveswere closely guarded by. armed: police, and;often:escorted by armoured cars. Itis obvious that very considerable military forces and large numbers oft police arekept in Palestine. The police are armed; they are conspicuous everywhere; and&apos;throughout the country there are substantially built police barracks.2. We do not think that the conditions in Palestine since the Mandate havebeen fully appreciated,throughout the world, and accordingly we have thought it right to set out in Appendix.V a list of the main incidents of disorder.. It willbe seen that up to the year. 1939 the Jews exercised very great restraint. It is inrecent years that the threat:to law and order has come from them.3: A. revival-of the illegal immigration traffic has occurred since the end:of the war in Europe. During the summer of 1945 there was an influx on asubstantial scale by land over the northern frontier. More recently there have beensuccessive cases of entry.by sea. The Jewish organisations are actively engagedin these operations, carried out latterly by the purchase or charter of. ships forvoyages from southern Europe in the absence of effective control of embarkation.Armed clashes are liable to arise, from the efforts to prevent interference; a numberhave arisen) from the search for illegal immigrants and -arms. Moreover;-as recentincidents directly concerned with illegal immigration may be cited the sabotageof patrol launches and attacks on coastguard)stations;The present scale and imethod of illegal immigration by sea can be seen from,three recent cases.   Two ships, arrived towards the end of our stay in Palestine,and one a few weeks previously.  All three were intercepted and,1 in accordancewith the usual procedure, the-illegal immigrants taken to a clearance camp, where,[31686]- c -
subject to check, they were released, their numbers being deducted from the immigration quota. The first of these ships sailed from northern Italy. It washer maiden voyage. She carried 911 immigrants, 554 men and 357 women.Practically all were young people. The second carried 247 immigrants, of whom89 were women. With one exception, all were young people. The third, whicharrived on the day of our departure from Palestine, was reported in the press ascoming from a French Mediterranean port and carrying 733 immigrants.The second ship, according to press reports, was expected to land the immigrants at Tel-Aviv, and the plans for screening the immigrants were evidentin the sporadic incidents which occurred in that area. Apart from firing on thepolice, there were incidents of mining and blocking of access by road and x*ailwhich could only be designed to isolate the approach to the beach/4. A sinister aspect of recent years is the development of large illegal-armed forces. The following is the structure as stated to us by the military-authorities : The general organisation is the &quot; Haganah.&quot; xl is an illegal developmentof the former organisation, in the days of Turkish rule, of armed watchmenwho protected Jewish settlements. To-day it is completely organised, under a central control and with subsidiary territorial commands, in three branches,each of which includes women, viz. : A static force composed of settlers and townsfolk, with an estimated strength-of 40,000;A field army, based on the Jewish Settlement Police and trained in moremobile operations, with an estimated strength of 16,000;A full-time force (Palmach), permanently mobilised and provided with transport, with an estimated peace establishment of 2,000 and war establishmentof some 6,000.It is known that the Haganah has been procuring arms over a period ofyears. Vast quantities have been obtained from the residue of the campaignsin the Middle East. Arms and ammunition are kept and concealed in speciallyconstructed caches in settlements and towns. The following are particulars,furnished tp us by the military authorities, of a search which was conducted atBiriya Settlement about the time of our arrival in Palestine.During the night of 27th/28th February, 1946, shots were fired at a sentryof the Arab Legion at his post distant some mile or mile and a half from Biriya.Although wounded in the thigh, he returned the fire. Next morning blood-stainsand bandages were found and police dogs carried a line direct from there toBiriya.Biriya is situated in a commanding position on the hills of Northern Galilee.It can only be described as a fort.The population of Biriya were detained. They consisted of twenty-five men.Their identity cards showed that they came from other parts of Palestine. Itwas apparent that they were a platoon undergoing training.A search in the neighbourhood revealed two arms caches. They contained,among other equipment, one Sten gun, one Bren, four modern rifles, one wirelessset and grenades.Numerous documents were also discovered in the caches.   Their substance-connected the caches with Biriya, and a police dog taking scent from the documents identified one of the men in the building at Biriya.   The documents,included standing orders for the camp, notes on the structure and duties of theHaganah, training manuals, notes on neighbouring military and police camps.5. Something in the nature of conscription is in force, as is shown by twopress notices of the 6th November, 1945 : Palestine Post.&quot; Ayear&apos;s national service in communal settlements will now be required from all Jewish senior school children aged 17-18; till now it was obligatoryonly to those who had already left school.&quot;Haboker (in this case a translation from Hebrew).&quot; The national institutions have decided to widen the scope of the year&apos;service duty, which up to now has been imposed on graduates of the secondary schools, and to impose it on all girls and boys aged 17-18.&apos;&apos; The Council of Youth Organisations decided, at its session on the31st October, 1945, immediately to begin fulfilment of the order given to the
Youth. The Council assumed the responsibility of enlisting immediately all members of the Movements who were born in 1928. The enlistment of thepupils of the secondary and trade schools will be carried out at a time whichis to be specially fixed. Before the 11th November, 1945, every Movementmust submit to the Jewish Agency&apos;s Recruiting Department in Tel-Aviv aroster of its members, male and female, who must enlist.&quot;A useful adjunct for training purposes is provided from the JewishSettlement Police, a supplementary police force originally formed in 1936 for the close protection of Jewish settlements. The minimum term of service issix months, during which period they are paid by the Government. We were informed that it often happens that they leave the police force after a short periodof service and thereafter serve in the Haganah.6. Apart from the Haganah, two further illegal armed organisations exist,,both having cut away from the parent body. One is the &quot; Irgun Zvai Leumi,&quot;which was formed in 1935 by dissident members of the Haganah. The other isthe &quot; Stern Group,&quot; which broke away from the Irgun early in the war when thelatter announced an &quot;armistice.&quot; The Irgun operates under its own secretcommand mainly in sabotage and terrorism against the Mandatory; its strength is estimated at from 3,000 to 5,000. The Stern Group engages in terrorism; its strength is said to be between 200 and 300.7. It seems clear that the activities of all these bodies could be greatly reduced if there was any co-operation with the authorities by the Jewish Agency;and its officers, and &quot;&quot;by the rest of the population. Unfortunately, the jewish agency ceased to co-operate with the Government, or at least reduced the measureof their co-operation as from the end of the war.We set out in the form of an extract from the Palestine Post of the^30th December, 1945, the attitude of the Chairman of the Executive of the jewish agency after the murders of the 27th December, 1945. In the course of his:evidence before us Mr. Ben Gurion said that he took responsibility for giving this,statement to the press :  &quot; Following upon the outrages which occurred on Thursday night, His-Excellency the High Commissioner summoned Mr. D. Ben Gurion andMr. M. Shertok to see him at Government House on Friday morning, it was-officially stated yesterday.&quot;It is learned that during the interview, Mr. Ben Gurion andMr. Shertok declared that the Jewish Agency completely dissociatedthemselves from the murderous attacks on Government and army establish-ments perpetrated on Thursday night. They expressed their profound sorrowat the loss of life caused by the attacks.&quot; But, they stated, any efforts by the Jewish Agency to assist in preventing such acts would be rendered futile by the policy pursued inPalestine by His Majesty&apos;s Government on which the primary responsibilityrests for the tragic situation created in the country, and which had led inrecent weeks to bloodshed and innocent victims among Jews, Britons andothers.&apos;&apos; The Jewish Agency representatives added that it was difficult to appealto the Yishuv to observe the law at a time when the Mandatory government itself was consistently violating the fundamental law of the country embodied in the Palestine Mandate.&quot;So long as this kind of view is put forward by the leaders of the jewish agency it is impossible to look for settled conditions.All three organisations to which reference has been made are illegal.We recognise that, until comparatively recently, efforts were made by theJewish Agency to curb attacks; we regret that these efforts appear to have ceased.We believe that those responsible for the working of the Jewish Agency a body1of great power and influence over the Jews in Palestine could do a great dealtowards putting an end to outrages such as we have described, which place thepeople of Palestine, as well as British soldiers and police, in constant danger.Private armies ought not to exist; they constitute a danger to the peace ofthe world.8. The position of Great Britain as Mandatory is not a happy one. TheChairman of the Executive of the Jewish Agency said that, in the event of thewithdrawal of the British troops, the Jews would take care of themselves. Jamal[31686] d
Fffendi Husseini, replying to a question, said that it was the wish of the Arabs ofPalestine that British forces and police should be withdrawn forthwith.Auni Bey Abdul Hadi, also representing the Arab Higher Committee, expressed his agreement. Jamal Effendi Husseini stated that he did not expect bloodshed,but that, on the withdrawal of British forces, there would be a return to thecondition which preceded the first world war (i.e., pre-Balfour Declaration). Weare,clear in our minds that, if British forces were withdrawn, there would beimmediate and prolonged bloodshed, the end of which it is impossible to predict.CHAPTER X.1. In view of the dissolution of the League of Nations and of the statementof the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs in the House of Commons on the13th November, 1945, we assume that the British Government will in the nearfuture prepare a draft Trusteeship Agreement for eventual submission to theUnited Nations, and that this Agreement will include the terms under whichPalestine will be administered. We do not propose to refer to the existingMandate in detail; it is set out in Appendix VI.2. Our views on future immigration policy are contained in Recommenda-tion No. 6 and in the Comments thereunder, and we have nothing to add to them.3. With regard to the future government of Palestine, we have reviewed the question of a solution by partition.The Peel Commission stated (Chapter XX, paragraph 19) : &quot; Manifestlythe problem cannot be solved by giving either the Arabs or the Jews all they want. The answer to the question &apos; which of them in the end will governPalestine? &apos; must surely be &apos; Neither.&apos; &quot; That is the view Which we also have formed. They recommended the termination of the Mandate, the partition ofthe country between the Arabs and the Jews (excepting the Holy Places) and the setting up of two independent States in treaty relations with Great Britain.These recommendations were rejected by the Arabs and they did not meet withthe complete approval of the Jews. They were adopted in the first instance by theGovernment of Great Britain, but subsequently a technical Commission was sentto Palestine to ascertain facts and to consider in detail the practical possibilitiesof a scheme of partition. As a result of the Partition Commission^ Report,His Majesty&apos;s Government announced their conclusion that the examination bythe Commission had shown that the political, administrative and financial difficulties involved in the proposal to create independent Arab and Jewish Statesinside Palestine were so great that the solution of the problem was impracticable.The proposal accordingly fell to the ground, and His Majesty&apos;s Governmentcontinued their responsibility for the government of the whole of Palestine.We have considered the matter anew and we have heard the views of variouswitnesses of great experience. Partition has an appeal at first sight as giving a prospect of early independence and self-government to Jews and Arabs, but inour view no partition would have any chance unless it was basically acceptable toJews and Arabs, and there is no sign of that to-day. We are accordingly unableto recommend partition as the solution.4. Palestine is a country unlike any other. It is not merely a place inwhich Arabs and Jews live. Millions of people throughout the world takea fervent interest in Palestine and in its Holy Places and are deeply grievedby the thought that it has been the seat of trouble for so long and by the fear that it may well become the cockpit of another war. Lord Milner in 1923, havingdeclared himself a strong supporter of pro-Arab policy, said : &quot; Palestine can never be regarded as a country on the same footing asthe other Arab countries. You cannot ignore all history and tradition inthe matter. You cannot ignore the fact that this is the cradle of two ofthe, great religions of the world. It is a sacred land to the Arabs, but itis also a sacred land to the Jew and the Christian; and the future of Palestinecannot possibly be left to be determined by the temporary impressions andfeelings of the Arab majority in the country of the present day.&quot;The Peel Commission having cited those words wrote (Chapter II, para-graph 51) : &quot; The case stated by Lord Milner against an Arab control of Palestineapplies equally to a Jewish control.&quot;   That expresses our view absolutely.Efforts have been made from time to time to encourage both Arabs and Jews to take part in the government of the country, but these efforts have failed
13117through mutual antagonism; perhaps they might have been pursued further.It is not the case of a backward people going through a period of tutelage: theissue lies between Jews and Arabs.We believe this can only be met by acceptance of the principle that thereshall be no domination of the one by the other, that Palestine shall be neitheran Arab nor a Jewish State. The setting up of self-governing institutions is dependent on the will to work together on the part of Jews and Arabs. Therehas been little sign of that in recent years and yet we hope a change may takeplace if and when the fear of dominance is removed. We do not think thatany good purpose would be served by our going into further detail; once the will to work together appears, representatives of both sides will be of help in framing a constitution; until that happens no step can be taken.Meantime, Palestine must remain under some form of mandate or trusteeship.We have suggested elsewhere in our report that much can be done to encouragegeneral advancement by the improvement of educational facilities and measuresdirected to narrowing the social and economic disparities. We feel, too, thatit should be possible to draw the communities closer together, and foster a popularinterest in self-government at the local level. Especially in the country districts,a spirit of good neighbourliness exists among the common people, Arabs and Jews, despite the general state of political tension in the country. Practicalco-operation is evident in day-to-day affairs. We suggest that local administrativeareas might be formed, some purely Arab or Jewish in composition, but someof mixed population where a corporate sense of civic responsibility can be encouraged and a new beginning made in the development of self-government.5. Land questions have been the cause of much friction and dispute betweenJews and Arabs. We are opposed to legislation and practices which discriminate against either, and for the reasons already given we recommend the rescissionand replacement of the Land Transfers Regulations of 1940 and the prohibitionof restrictions limiting employment on certain lands to members of one race,community or creed.We are aware of the criticisms of the existing Land Ordinances and we donot wish it to be thought that we consider that they afford adequate protection tothe Arab small-owners and tenants. In our opinion it should be possible to devise Ordinances furnishing proper protection to such Arabs no matter in whatpart of Palestine they may reside.6. We have already stated that the 100,000 certificates for Palestine, theimmediate authorisation of which we recommend, will provide for only acomparatively small proportion of the total number of Jewish refugees in Europe.The general problem of refugees must, we feel, be dealt with by the united nations. In our considered opinion it is a matter for regret that this distressingproblem has not been dealt with before this time. True the Great Powers havehad many problems facing them and they have dealt with many displaced persons,but the fact remains that Jews and others have remained in camps or centres for very many months.We observe that at a recent meeting of the General Assembly of the united nations the problem of displaced persons and refugees of all categories was recognised to be one of immediate urgency, and it was referred to the Economicand Social Council, which has since established a special Committee for its consideration. Without presuming to advise that Committee, and with no desireto ^o b^vond our Terms of Reference, we cannot but observe that internationalbocfies already established for dealing with refugee problems have been unable,through insufficiency of financial resources or other reasons, to fulfil the hopesplaced in them at the time of their formation. The world looks forward, webelieve, to the birth of a truly effective agency of international collaboration inthe humanitarian task of migration and resettlement.Lausanne, Switzerland,2Wh April, 1946.
