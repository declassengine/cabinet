this document IS the property of his britannic majesty&apos;s government&quot;Printed for the Cabinet.   May 1946.SECRET. copy ^   38CP. (46) 191.8th May, 1946.CABINET.DIVORCE.SECOND INTERIM REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON REFORM of legal PROCEDURE.Memorandum by the Lord Chancellor.I am circulating, on behalf of the Committee on Reform of Legal Procedure,a Second Interim Report dealing exclusively with Divorce.2. It will be seen that we have come to the conclusion that there is a need for a special enquiry into the costs and delays involved in divorce proceedings,and into certain other aspects of divorce procedure.3. We recommend the setting up of a Committee with fairly narrow termsof reference. If the Cabinet agrees it would be desirable to proceed expeditiously,as the questions to be considered are becoming more and more acute.(Intld.) J.Home of Lords, S. W. 1,8th May, 1946.SECOND INTERIM REPORT.OUR first Interim Report (circulated to the Cabinet on the 8th February,1946 see CP. (46) 56) dealt solely with Service Divorce cases. attention was drawn to the urgent need to expedite the preparation of the cases, andto strengthen the judicial machinery to deal with them when ready. Therecommendations made in that Report were accepted by the Cabinet see C.M. (46)17th Conclusion, Minute 6 and steps have been taken to implement them.The expansion of the Services Divorce Department of the Law Society is inprogress, and various procedural reforms in the Divorce registries have alreadybeen effected. As soon as these measures result in an increased number of casesreaching the Courts, special Commissioners will be appointed to supplement theexisting Judge-power.2. Apart from the special problems of Service Divorce we have, as statedin paragraph 2 of my Memorandum covering our First Interim Report, givenfirst attention to the question of divorce procedure. We did so (1) becausethe second paragraph of our Terms of Reference invited us in particular &quot; Toconsider whether there is need for a special enquiry into the costs and delaysinvolved in divorce proceedings . . . .&quot;; and (2) because, at an early stage inour deliberations, we agreed that the growing volume of divorce cases has become a matter for public concern, and that the Government ought to satisfy themselves that the administration of the divorce law is satisfactory.[31791]
3. During the course of our deliberations we have considered three separateproposals for the reform of the administration of the divorce law: (1) A scheme submitted to the Lord Chancellor by the President of the divorce Division;.(2) A  Report   prepared   by   the   Legal   and  Judicial   Group   of   theParliamentary Labour Party;(3) A Memorandum by the Haldane Society.4. The President&apos;s Scheme has the support of all the Divorce Judges, andhas been approved in principle by the Archbishops of Canterbury and York.The scheme proposes that jurisdiction to dissolve marriages should remainexclusively in the High Court as at present, but that all undefended petitionsfounded on adultery, desertion or cruelty should be referred to a DivorceCommission, for investigation and report to the Court. The Commission would act by panels of two Commissioners of whom one would be a lawyer and theother a person experienced in social work. If possible both parties to the marriagewould be before the Commissioners, and their first endeavour would be to effect a reconciliation, a feature of the scheme on which much emphasis is laid bythe Archbishops. If reconciliation failed, the Commission would proceed to enquire into the facts and would make a report, to the Court. This report would state the findings of the Commission, and whether they recommendedthat the Court should pronounce a final decree dissolving the marriage or shouldhear the case. The report would also, where appropriate, make recommendations as to maintenance and as; to the. custody of any children; of the marriage.The President estimates that by the proposed procedure the costs nowincurred in an ordinary undefended: divorce suit might be reduced by as much as50 per cent.  He also anticipates a net saving of time.5, The Legal and Judicial Group of the Parliamentary Labour Partyconsider that all matrimonial causes brought by persons - in. the lower income groups should be tried in the. County Court, on the groundsel) that the. CountyOourt Judges have more experience of social conditions generally than HighCourt Judges; (2) that the County Court, is cheaper and more expeditious. Theeffect of their proposals would- be that all divorce cases- in. which the wife wasclaiming alimony not exceeding  2pen week, or, in&apos;the case of husband?s- petitions?where the husband&apos;s income did not exceed  600 per annum, would go to theCounty Court. This group is in favour of a scheme of reconciliation both for theCounty Court and the High Court in the County Court no petition could be filedwithout the leave of the Judge, who would receive-a. report from a speciallyappointed reconciliation officer.6. The Haldane Society recommend that all undefended divorce cases should be tried in the County Court, on the grounds of expedition and cheapness.But they do not regard reconciliation as either practical or desirable, on thegrounds (1) that reconciliation would be resented by both parties as an inter-ference by strangers in what they regard as an essentially private matter; and(2).that any scheme of official reconciliation would require the creation of a verylarge staff adequately, trained in this special work.7-. We do not consider that it is within our Terms of Reference: to recom-mend the adoption of one or other of the proposals mentioned above; nor; indeed;would we be in a position to do so, as opinion among us as to their&apos; respective-merits is divided. But, from the fact that such proposals have been laid beforeus, and from other information which we have obtained, we are satisfied&apos;th&apos;at:thereis undoubtedly a- need for an enquiry into the administration of the: divorce law;with particular reference to the costs and delays involved in divorce proceedings.-&apos;It would;be; desirable to emphasise that&apos;any enquiry now-instituted is: concerned only with matters primarily procedural. The scope of the enquiry must; however;be wide enough to embrace the questions of reconciliation and the rival merits ofthe High Court and the County Court. It would be better to set up a Committee,which would be preponderantly legal and expert but with&apos; lay representation,rather than a Royal Commission, the proceedings of which would be slower and.inevitably less technical.in character.8.   We therefore recommend: (1) That a Committee be set up with the following-Terms of Reference:: &quot;To examine the present system governing the administrationof the law of divorce and nullity of marriage in England and Wales;
3267and, on the assumption that the grounds upon which marriages may now be dissolved remain unchanged, to consider and report upon whatprocedural reforms ought to be introduced in the general interests oflitigants, with special reference to expediting the hearing of suitsand reducing costs; and in particular Avhether any (and, if so, what)machinery should be made available for the purpose of attempting areconciliation between the parties, either before or after proceedingshave been commenced.&quot;(2) That the Committee should be preponderantly legal in character, andshould comprise a High Court Judge with experience in Divorce (as chairman), three or four other lawyers, and two or three laymen (oneof whom should be a woman).(3) That the composition of the Committee should be decided upon by theLord Chancellor, in consultation with the Home Secretary.Signed on behalf of the Committee,JOWITT, Chairman.7th May, 1946
