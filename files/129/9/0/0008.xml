4HIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OP HIS BRITANNIC IvlAJESTYfS GOVERNMENT)secret.P.(h6) 1.581 6t&quot;n April,  1 9k6.copy NO.CABINETTRUSTEESHIPMemorandum by tjeore tary of Statefor the colonies associatecirculated by themyself fullySecretary of with that state for part of the paperDominion Affairs+which deals with our own United Kingdom mandated territories in Africa.      I am sure thatSmuts to agree to the draft trusteeshihave out forward.we should press Field Marshalre ements2.        I have some doubts, however,  about section B of thepaper, which deals with South West Africa under South Africanmandate.      The Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs prcoofesthat we should tell Field Marshal Smuts that we are ready inprinciple to support the South ^african Government in their proposed application to the United Nations in regard to So ,thWest Africa - an application which, as we know, will involvethe incorporation of South West Africa into the Union ofSouth Africa.      I appreciate that we should not seek tocreate unnecessary difficulties for Field Marshal Smuts,Grounds for distinguishingand that there are reasonableSouth-West Africa from our own mandated territories in Africa,in view of its position adjacent to the Union.      But on the merits of the case I feel that it would be unwise for HisMajesty&apos;s Government to give any public support to the policyof incorporating South West Africa in the Union.3.        At the recent United Nations Assembly the South Africandelegate was sharply criticised in many quarters (the PrimeMinister of New Zealand was among the critics) for the  standwhich his Government were taking about South West Africa.There is,  I bolievin thisAfricanletter,NationsAfricangenerala considerable body of liberal opinioncountry too which regards the attitude of the SouthGovernment as a breach of the spirit, if not of theof the trusteeship system as embodied in the UnitedCharter. To associate ourselves with the SouthGovernment&apos;s policy would, I feel, detract from theposition about trusteeship on which we. have takenoar stand.k.        It should also be remembered that the French are stillhesitating to place  their African mandated territories under trusteeship, and would like if they could to carry out a policyof incorporation.      If we supported South Africa, we should beon weaker ground to urge the French to come into line with us.The result&quot;might be that we should find ourselves the onlyPower in Africa with territories under the trusteeship system,with the exception of the Belgians with their small territory of Ruanda - Urundi.+   CP. (Zj.6) 157.

5.        I would deprecate any suggestion that we should make our support for General Smuts over South West Africa aquid pre quo for his support to our trusteeship agreements for Tanganyika etc.      The two issues should in my view be kept distinct and each treated on their own merits.6.        I suggest that the furthest we should go is toinform Field Marshal Smuts that we will not oppose (atthe United Nations Assembly or elsewhere) the policy ofthe South African Government about South West Africa;but that we should not undertake to give him our positive-support.      Alternatively we might simply say that wecannot commit ourselves until we have seen the SouthAfrican proposals in detail and had time  to study them.pT   R   Blt* n. n.Colonial Office, S.W. 1.1 6th April, 19^-6.
