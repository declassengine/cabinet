THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTPrinted for the Cabinet.   April 1946. 41SECRET. Copy No.   3gCP. (46) 157.15th April, 1946.CABINET.TRUSTEESHIP.Memorandum by the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs.I should be glad to have the approval of my colleagues for the line to be takenin discussion of trusteeship issues at the forthcoming meeting with dominion prime Ministers.2.   The principal controversial issues are (A) the South African Government&apos;s objections to our draft trusteeship agreements for Tanganyika, Togoland and the Cameroons;(B) the South African Governments policy of incorporation of South-WestAfrica in the Union of South Africa.There is no outstanding point affecting our &quot; B &quot; mandates between ourselves and the Canadian, Australian or New Zealand Governments.A. The South African Governments Objections to the United KingdomGovernment&apos;s Policy.3. (1) Field-Marshal Smuts has expressed doubts over the strategic aspectsof placing Tanganyika under trusteeship.(2) He is afraid that the Soviet Union, by its membership of the trusteeship council, will acquire an opportunity to interfere in African affairs.(3) He would prefer terms for Tanganyika nearer to those of &quot; C &quot; Mandates,referring, in particular, to the provisions of the draft Agreements for non-discrimination and to the desirability of facilitating closer union with other british East African territories.(4) He is opposed to our proceeding internationally with the draftAgreements until Soviet and United States policies have become clearer.4. We have done what we can to dispel the South African Governmentsmisgivings, and have (1) reassured them as to the strategic aspects (the Chiefs of Staff are satisfied with the proposed terms of trusteeship);(2) stated our view that the trusteeship system need not give foreign countriesany greater pretext for interfering than the Mandates System, andthat, if foreign Governments are disposed to make difficulties in regardto African territories, they will be able in any event to do so in one form or another;(3) pointed out - that the terms of our draft Agreements represent animportant advance on the existing &quot; B &quot; Mandate terms in respect ofdefence and economic development and present no obstacle to close reunion of East African territories;(4) emphasised that we are anxious to proceed with the Agreements to dispeluncertainty in East Africa and suspicion in foreign countries.5. The South African Government have not informed us of their acquies-acquiescence in our views though they have agreed to our going ahead with the publicationof our draft trusteeship agreements provided that their formal consent is notimplied. After consultation with the Secretary of State for the Colonies i recommend that we should make every effort to secure Field-Marshal Smuts&apos;sformal acceptance of our policy while he is in London, and for this purpose shouldtake the following line: (1) We oannot now go back on the decision taken in January to place the territories under trusteeship, which the Cabinet have approved as[31658]
being the only possible policy in the light of our obligations as amember of the United Nations, and which has been announced toParliament by the Prime Minister and to the United nations assembly by the Foreign Secretary. Soviet policy is admittedlyuncertain but this does not warrant abandonment of confidence inthe United Nations and the trusteeship system.(2) It is impossible to alter the whole character of the draft terms of trusteeship, which have been circulated to foreign Governments. Weare satisfied that there has never been any practical prospect of ourobtaining international acceptance of mere favourable terms of trusteeship.(3) It is important to proceed as soon as possible with the Agreements, asdelay may prejudice the prospects of obtaining the terms we desire.B. South-West Africa.6. The South African Government have announced that they propose tosubmit to the United Nations General Assembly in September their case for grant to their Mandated Territory of South-West Africa of a status under whichit would be internationally recognised as an integral part of the Union, andhave declared their readiness to submit reports on the territory to the united nations, as in the past to the League of Nations. Field-Marshal Smuts mayraise the question of support for the South African Government on the part ofother British Commonwealth Governments at the United Nations general assembly.7. There is a good case for differentiation in the treatment of South-WestAfrica from that of other Mandated Territories, for(a) it is contiguous with the Union,(b) it forms a convenient unit with the Union of South Africa for adminsitrative ourposes, its own population being only some350,000, and(c) the European population of South-West Africa have expressed their desire for incorporation in the Union and it is understood that Field-Marshal Smuts hopes to obtain definite proof of the assent of thenative population also to this course.8. In a matter of such importance to South Africa it is justifiable forthe South African Government to expect to receive the support of the UnitedKingdom and other British Commonwealth Governments in their applicationto the United Nations. So far as the United Kingdom is concerned, it is ofgreat political importance to maintain cordial relations with the South african government on this question. If, therefore, Field-Marshal Smuts raises thepoint, I recommend that in view of (a), (b) and (c) in paragraph 7 above, weshould intimate our readiness, in principle, to give our support, subject to consideration in due course of the South African Governments detailed proposals. We should also do what we can at the forthcoming meeting to securethe support of the Canadian. Australian and New Zealand Governments for theSouth African Governments policy or, at least, their agreement not to oppose it.Recom mendations .9. I accordingly recommend that, in discussion with Dominion PrimeMinisters -(1) We should press Field-Marshal Smuts to accept our draft trusteeship agreements for Tanganyika, Togoland and the Cameroons;(2) We should be prepared to intimate our readiness in principle to supportthe South African Government in their proposed application to theUnited Nations in regard to South-West Africa;(3) We should do what we can to secure the support .of the Canadian,Australian and New Zealand Governments in the South african governments policy in regard to South-West Africa, or, at least,their agreement not to oppose that policy at the United nations general Assembly.A.Dominions Office, Downing Street, S.W. 1,15th April, 1946.
